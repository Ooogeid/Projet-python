1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,710
- I got into Vanderbilt.
- Congratulations, baby.

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,754
Not that I'll be able to go.

3
00:00:04,923 --> 00:00:05,880
Lyla, baby!

4
00:00:06,114 --> 00:00:08,842
Tim, I need to get Lyla back.
I don't know what to do next.

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,886
You gotta give her some more time,
Mr. Garrity, that's what I think.

6
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:15,305
<i>The Panthers of Dillon Texas
are going to State!</i>

7
00:00:15,768 --> 00:00:17,050
- Hey, honey.
- Huh?

8
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:18,099
Look.

9
00:00:19,616 --> 00:00:21,272
- Stay here.
- No, I'm coming with you.

10
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:23,522
I don't care what you do, Dad.
Screw you!

11
00:00:23,993 --> 00:00:26,358
You don't talk to me like that!

12
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:27,714
Joe, stop it!

13
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:31,071
He hit him.
He hit my baby.

14
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,373
And here are your soon-to-be
State champions...

15
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,588
the Dillon Panthers.

16
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,141
All right, I wanna hear you...
State, State!

17
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:11,658
The problem is, Clint, is that
I just spent the entire weekend

18
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:14,906
giving support to J.D. and to Katie.

19
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:18,603
And now, for me to have to turn around
and call Child Protective Services...

20
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:20,995
You have a mandate, you're the boss.

21
00:01:22,143 --> 00:01:24,293
Your husband does too, by the way.

22
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:31,047
I honestly just don't think
I can do it, Clint.

23
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:33,625
Tami, you don't know anything.

24
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,225
You think this might've been
the first time it happened,

25
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,869
but you don't really know that.

26
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:40,194
All you know is that you
and a lot of other people

27
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,727
witnessed this guy beating up his kid.
That's child abuse!

28
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:45,350
I know, I know...

29
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,046
It's not like we have a choice.

30
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,432
No, I don't think
we do have a choice.

31
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:26,395
Do you want me to do it?

32
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:33,412
No, I should do it, I'll do it.

33
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:39,709
I'll do it.

34
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:48,124
3x12: UNDERDOGS

35
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:53,171
Subtitles: Team Panthers

36
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,591
With the participation of:

37
00:02:56,761 --> 00:03:00,428
benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, GillesSilb,
Ju, ouazo, tactactac, Teardrop, TVnut

38
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,234
<i>This is it, folks.</i>

39
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:37,563
<i>Three days till football Christmas.</i>

40
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:40,156
<i>Yes, it's no secret
that many of us are worried</i>

41
00:03:40,281 --> 00:03:43,055
<i>that the Panthers are about
to get their stockings stuffed.</i>

42
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:47,433
<i>South Texas is the best high school
football team I have ever seen, period.</i>

43
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:50,145
<i>Best ever?
What about the '81 Panthers?</i>

44
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:53,561
<i>Even the '81 Panthers would have
a tough time beating this squad.</i>

45
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:57,403
<i>I'm just saying, Coach Taylor's gonna
need help from above to beat these boys.</i>

46
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:23,379
Billy! Get out,
I'm going to the bathroom.

47
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:26,640
- I've really gotta pee, so how long...
- Close the door, I'm in the bathroom!

48
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:29,434
Fine!
I'll just piss in the sink!

49
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,341
Tim, wake your ass up!

50
00:04:32,547 --> 00:04:33,711
Seriously, man.

51
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:36,736
I got something to show you.
This is big.

52
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:38,529
Billy, we have school!

53
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,944
Well, you're gonna have
to skip school, Lyla!

54
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:43,007
Tim, get your ass up!

55
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:44,522
This is your future.

56
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,184
Stop!

57
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:51,539
- Love it.
- No, seriously, check it out.

58
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:55,501
What do you think?

59
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,181
- It's beautiful, right?
- It's perfect, man.

60
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:00,757
It was either this or Quiznos,

61
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:02,762
- but I couldn't pass this up.
- No-brainer.

62
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:04,762
Yeah, I'm gonna name it
Riggins' Rigs.

63
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,972
- It's gonna be awesome.
- That's perfect, dude.

64
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,515
Put a hydraulic lift there,
where that car is...

65
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,378
a little refrigerator over
in the corner, stocked full of beer...

66
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:13,639
A must-have.

67
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:15,747
24/7, fixing cars, drinking beer.

68
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:18,066
I mean, what more do you need?

69
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:22,392
It's awesome, man.

70
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:25,779
It's awesome.

71
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,548
Don't expect them to be confused
by a spread offense.

72
00:05:34,673 --> 00:05:37,878
They faced four of 'em this year, and
none of 'em scored more than 10 points.

73
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,548
Hahn, you gotta give
our quarterback time to throw.

74
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,467
That's gonna be key in this game.

75
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:45,598
Are you seeing that secondary?

76
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:47,011
I do.

77
00:05:47,374 --> 00:05:49,724
Coach, you're not
worried about them?

78
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:54,186
Can't afford to be worried.
Doctor's orders, bad for the ticker.

79
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,855
They're big, they're fast.
There's no doubt about it.

80
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,026
We've never seen anyone like them
yet this year, but you know what?

81
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,294
That's the one thing... They've never
faced us before either, gentlemen.

82
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,489
Keep that in mind.
It's gonna be a good fight.

83
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:07,366
It'll be a damned good fight.

84
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,500
Look at that!

85
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,455
I'm so impressed
with this portfolio!

86
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,550
- Thanks.
- Oh, my Lord.

87
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:19,390
It's kinda crazy thinking I might
actually go to school in Chicago.

88
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:21,797
I know, but you could...
I think you could really do it.

89
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,633
The portfolio's the most important
thing, and you've got great grades...

90
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:27,720
I think your teachers can give you
great recommendations.

91
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:31,222
I still gotta get in, though.

92
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:32,437
So...

93
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:35,994
- What d'you think, Jules?
- I think it seems like a really...

94
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:38,856
bright possibility,
and it's in a real city,

95
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:42,244
so you have coffee houses
and museums and...

96
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,957
culture.

97
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,866
- That's right, that's for sure.
- Yeah, more than here.

98
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:55,873
- So, are you done?
- Hold on one second.

99
00:06:57,002 --> 00:06:59,500
OK, I believe I am finished.

100
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,510
- Come sit down, we'll go over this.
- Wait . OK, well? What do you think?

101
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:06,091
What do you think?

102
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:09,646
How do you feel that colleges
are going to respond to this essay?

103
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,763
You hate it.
No, you hate it.

104
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,181
No, I didn't say
that I hated this paper at all.

105
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:15,934
I did not say that I hate...
OK.

106
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,104
Tyra, I really do hate this paper.

107
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:23,695
It's because there were a lot of...
there were a lot of...

108
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:27,945
- a lot of things that weren't great.
- Well, OK, like what?

109
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:30,949
Would you explain to me why

110
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:34,999
every paragrah has a tie back
into Applebee's, and why...

111
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:37,955
'Cause I use it as a metaphor.
It works.

112
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:41,852
"Sometimes it gets busy.
You just have to roll with the punches."

113
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:43,536
"Just like in life..."

114
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:50,581
It reads like a five-page
needlepoint... pillow.

115
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:52,471
And it...
And it's painful.

116
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:54,638
That's not fair,
it's due this weekend.

117
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:57,892
Well, you just have to dig
a little bit deeper, and... fastly.

118
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:01,772
- I hate you.
- All right.

119
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:14,702
Joe McCoy?

120
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:19,434
I'm Mark Enderland, this is Jodie Russi.
We're with Child Protective Services.

121
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:22,046
We'd like to speak
with you and your family.

122
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:26,046
I want a lawyer present

123
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,298
for this questioning.
You can't divide us up like this

124
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:30,703
- and play good cop/bad cop.
- Joe, Joe, calm down.

125
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:33,020
Has your dad ever hit you before?

126
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:37,327
Are you afraid of your father now?

127
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:41,787
No, I'm not. I just want
this whole thing to be over.

128
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:43,884
Has he ever hit your mother?

129
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:52,410
Are you guys gonna take him away
from me or something?

130
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:55,142
OK, no.
This is outrageous.

131
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:59,267
- What country do you think we live in?
- Mr. McCoy, I need you to calm down.

132
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:02,835
If you don't cooperate with us,
we can take your boy out of your custody

133
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,085
- pending our investigation.
- Oh, my God. Joe, just shut up!

134
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,301
Please!

135
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:20,639
The coolest thing is, of all the places
to study art, I mean...

136
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:23,894
Art Institute of Chicago, they got like
one of the biggest Van Gogh collections

137
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:27,058
in the country, and...
there's just art everywhere in the city,

138
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:30,410
like they got Picasso
sculptures just in the...

139
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:32,108
in the streets and stuff.

140
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:35,990
And the thing is, Mrs. Taylor seems
to think I can actually get in there.

141
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:38,960
Of course you can.
Matt, I told you, you're talented.

142
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:42,831
The only thing is, even if I get in,
I don't know how I'm gonna pay for it.

143
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:44,874
Well, I've got a little saved.

144
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,501
And I can send you
some money each month, and...

145
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,737
you know,
people always need haircuts.

146
00:09:51,582 --> 00:09:53,358
Where are you sending money?

147
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:01,224
Where are you thinking about going,
honey? What's that?

148
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,278
There's just this art school
at the Art Institute of Chicago.

149
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,526
Mrs. Taylor, Coach's wife,

150
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:10,858
she thinks I got a really good chance
of getting in there, maybe.

151
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,387
Chicago?

152
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:16,932
Chicago, that's...
That's way up in Illinois!

153
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,614
That's too far, honey, I mean...

154
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:24,186
- What would I do here without you?
- I don't know.

155
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:27,583
Well, Lorraine, you know,
I still could stay here,

156
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,312
- I'd like to do that.
- I think I made it perfectly clear.

157
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,281
I'm not living with you.

158
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:35,174
Grandma, it was just an idea.

159
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,722
And Matthew, what's this nonsense
about art school?

160
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,493
In't that just gonna waste
a whole bunch of money?

161
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:45,477
- Yeah, I mean, it was just an idea.
- Wan't a good idea, was it?

162
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,639
Yeah, you're probably right.

163
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,068
- Get in!
- Go, go!

164
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:55,481
Push that ball!

165
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,906
Get back in the box, let's go.
Let's run it again.

166
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:08,750
- Come on, guys, let's get in there.
- This offense plays on Saturday

167
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,213
like we're practicing today,
we will win State, gentlemen!

168
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,590
Now, coaches and I wanna
recognize someone today

169
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,619
not just for what they do on the field,
but what they do off the field...

170
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,510
which is what we expect
from the players out here.

171
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:22,750
Where's Lance?

172
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:25,603
- 8-5! 8-5!
- Step in the middle, son.

173
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:32,315
Lance deserved himself
a spot on special teams, gentlemen!

174
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:36,070
- In the State?
- Do us proud.

175
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,737
Let's go, Coach,
you wanna bring 'em in, let's go!

176
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:43,077
Break it out!
Let's break it in!

177
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:48,174
- So what do you think, Coach Spivey?
- We need to spike their Gatorade.

178
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:49,825
Kids are huge!

179
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,512
We gotta shut down their penetration,
we'll get killed on that one.

180
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,921
Coach!

181
00:11:58,053 --> 00:12:00,678
Was that you that called
those people from CPS?

182
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:05,573
Give us a minute.

183
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:24,994
Yes, it was.

184
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,330
Why?

185
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:35,879
Because it's the law, that's why.

186
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:39,985
Why would you call the cops
on my dad?

187
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,623
- You think I don't know you hate him?
- Son, it's not a matter of that.

188
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:48,187
You didn't have to do anything, you...
You wanted to!

189
00:12:48,312 --> 00:12:51,234
I'm sorry you think that.
That's not the case, though.

190
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:53,271
Sorry?

191
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:56,319
That doesn't help me.

192
00:12:58,243 --> 00:13:00,667
I play football for you, Coach,
that's it!

193
00:13:11,296 --> 00:13:12,505
So how are you?

194
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:16,175
Oh, honey, I've been knocked down
millions of time before,

195
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,554
I can get back up.

196
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:19,923
When the going gets tough,
the tough keep going.

197
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,397
But that's not...
I just wanna tell you, Lyla, that...

198
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,138
I owe you an apology.

199
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:30,600
And the only reason I did what I did
was because I didn't want

200
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,117
to disappoint you.

201
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:35,355
But I know it was stupid.

202
00:13:37,352 --> 00:13:38,568
Yes, it was.

203
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,601
But Lyla, I'd really...

204
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:44,656
I want you to move back in.

205
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:46,985
I really want that.

206
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:48,887
OK.

207
00:13:50,457 --> 00:13:52,747
- OK?
- Yeah, OK. I mean...

208
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,791
The Riggins house is disgusting,
so sure.

209
00:13:57,918 --> 00:13:59,541
So the honeymoon's over.

210
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:01,745
No, the honeymoon is not over.

211
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,032
Tim and I are doing great, actually.

212
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,908
And in fact, the reason
I'm not mad at you anymore

213
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:10,657
is 'cause the whole college thing
worked out.

214
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,738
- What do you mean?
- I'll go to San Antonio State with Tim.

215
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:18,509
And we're probably gonna get
a place together.

216
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:23,777
It's like the whole Vanderbilt thing
not working out was like fate, you know.

217
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:26,134
Well...

218
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:27,664
OK.

219
00:14:28,844 --> 00:14:30,274
San Antonio State.

220
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:37,083
- Tyra!
- I'm in here!

221
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:38,924
Hey, how's it going?

222
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:42,249
So I'm going to be playing
in the State game.

223
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:47,677
Are you understanding what I'm saying?
I'm playing at the State game.

224
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:51,389
I'm not gonna be on the bench, I'm
gonna be on the field... this time.

225
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,267
I'm sorry.
That's... that's... amazing.

226
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:57,120
Well, thank you.

227
00:14:57,657 --> 00:15:01,300
So, listen. Whatever crappy seats
that you have, throw 'em away,

228
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:05,069
because I have some less crappy seats,
and you'll wanna be as close as possible

229
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:08,323
- whenever the magic happens.
- Landry, I can't go.

230
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:14,204
I'm sorry, I know that's lame,
but I have to finish this.

231
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:20,187
No, you're right.

232
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,782
I know that I'm being selfish.
I know I should be happy for her,

233
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:41,356
she's, you know,
pursuing her dreams,

234
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,007
but at the same time,
this is huge for me, and...

235
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:46,654
You are being selfish, 'cause you're
really starting to bum me out.

236
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,112
- You're killing my buzz.
- Dude, that's pathetic.

237
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:51,991
If a tree falls in the forest
and there's no one there to hear it,

238
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:58,248
- does it actually make a sound?
- What are you talking about? Who cares?

239
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,543
- Would you smile?!
- Stop talking! You grab this drink,

240
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,469
we're gonna celebrate, OK?
We're gonna take a shot

241
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:07,882
- I don't really do well with alcohol.
- ... to your hard work and to State.

242
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:11,553
- To State. You tilt your top, like so.
- Don't taste it 'cause you'll be sick.

243
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,955
- Hamilton, Hamilton.
- We've got the best, I think.

244
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:51,219
Listen, I hope that you and I can find
some time to get together and...

245
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:53,844
find a way to maybe help J.D.
through some of this.

246
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:56,930
Trying to put out that fire
you started, Coach?

247
00:16:57,689 --> 00:16:59,675
Joe, I'm not talking about
any kind of blame

248
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,062
and I'm sure you're not either.
I'm talking about helping your son out.

249
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:06,530
Well, I deeply appreciate your concern
but I tell you what,

250
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:09,619
I can handle J.D.
He's just fine.

251
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,431
Good luck, Joe.

252
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:21,663
Let's go, gentlemen!
Everybody ready?

253
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:23,583
- Yes, sir!
- Let's hear it!

254
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:27,003
All right, sit back, enjoy the ride.

255
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:33,259
Have you seen Landry?

256
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,345
- You know where he is?
- Naw, haven't seen him.

257
00:17:35,915 --> 00:17:37,290
You haven't?

258
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:39,557
What the hell?

259
00:17:48,222 --> 00:17:50,741
- Where the hell are you?
- <i>Where are you at?</i>

260
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:52,653
I'm on the bus on my way to Austin.

261
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:54,424
Oh, my God...

262
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:57,506
<i>You better start driving
'cause we already left.</i>

263
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,285
I gotta... I gotta...
Mindy!

264
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:07,084
- Tyra!
- Stop yelling.

265
00:18:08,162 --> 00:18:09,629
Oh, yeah, totally gotta puke!

266
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:13,164
- Rough night?
- You gotta get all your stuff together.

267
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:15,718
- Shouldn't you be on a bus?
- Actually, I missed the bus,

268
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:18,553
- and I need you to take me to Austin...
- Well, I can't.

269
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,616
I can't drive
because I'm pretty sure I'm still...

270
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:23,393
I'm still, like, legally drunk.

271
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:26,268
- So will you please...
- You need to calm down for a second.

272
00:18:26,393 --> 00:18:28,356
OK, hey.
So, deal?

273
00:18:28,664 --> 00:18:31,907
Deal is, you help me with this,
and I will drive you.

274
00:18:32,032 --> 00:18:34,654
That's... that's fine.
I'll help you with whatever it is...

275
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:41,494
<i>Panther, Panther, Panther,
blue and gold,</i>

276
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,372
<i>take the ball off the field
and then we score.</i>

277
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:47,639
Hope is number one,
hit squad's the best.

278
00:18:47,764 --> 00:18:50,244
Panther, Panther, Panther
say forget the rest.

279
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:52,797
- I said, hey! Hey!
- Hey! Hey!

280
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,326
- I feel all right!
- I feel all right!

281
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:58,511
- I said, hey! Hey!
- Hey! Hey!

282
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:02,368
- I feel all right!
- I feel all right!

283
00:19:02,493 --> 00:19:05,101
- I said, Panther, Panther, Panther.
- I feel all right!

284
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,901
How y'all feel going into the game?

285
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:19,990
I really do feel
like we're gonna get the W here.

286
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:22,558
You really think...?

287
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:25,235
Marty Booker used to play quarterback,
now he's a receiver.

288
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,696
Seneca Wallace, you know,
he's the backup on Seattle

289
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:29,959
but he plays receiver.
And Hasselbeck's in there...

290
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:39,102
Has Matthew ever said anything to you
about wanting to be an artist?

291
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:42,513
Well, he's really good at drawing,

292
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,079
and it's something
that he really loves...

293
00:19:45,742 --> 00:19:47,310
You've seen his stuff, haven't you?

294
00:19:47,673 --> 00:19:49,541
Oh, yeah, I've seen it, all that...

295
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:53,229
artwork, and it's good,
but I never thought he was serious.

296
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:54,691
He loves football, honey.

297
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,521
Well, he does love football, but...

298
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,092
I just don't think
it's a career path he wants.

299
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:03,159
He's really, really good at art.

300
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:07,675
Well, I always encourage him.
Everything he does, I encourage him.

301
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:09,373
I know.

302
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:11,415
He knows that too.

303
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:17,697
I don't want to be the one
to hold him back from anything.

304
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:24,680
But I... I just can't stand
the thought of losing him.

305
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:29,948
I know. Me neither.

306
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,363
I'm ready to take us
to win the State.

307
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,655
I'm ready to win
the championship, so...

308
00:20:42,056 --> 00:20:44,617
- But I... I'll see y'all later.
- I thank you so much for your time.

309
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:08,502
How're you feeling?

310
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:16,314
I know this is a difficult situation,
I understand that, it's not lost on me.

311
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:21,237
This team's depending on you.

312
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,451
That means there's a freedom.

313
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:28,286
That's not pressure.

314
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:34,589
I want you to at least acknowledge
what I'm saying.

315
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:37,149
Yes, sir.

316
00:21:39,112 --> 00:21:40,756
Just try to leave it off the field.

317
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:54,353
Let's see if I can find
my sunglasses in here,

318
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,732
Gracie Belle.

319
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,357
Katie!

320
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:00,871
Hey, I've been trying to reach you.

321
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:04,289
- I was just heading off to my room.
- Listen, I know, I know, but...

322
00:22:04,414 --> 00:22:06,322
I know you must be furious at me.

323
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:09,409
I've been thinking about you, I just...
want to know how you're doing.

324
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:11,596
Well...

325
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,177
Let's see.

326
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:15,362
Two flunkies from the State of Texas

327
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:17,709
barge into my house
and scare me and my boy.

328
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:22,381
Joe and I have to take parenting classes
from a 23-year-old without kids.

329
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:25,467
And for the next year, CPS can just
drop by whenever they feel like it,

330
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:29,095
and if they don't like what they see,
they can take J.D. away.

331
00:22:29,853 --> 00:22:33,024
So that's how I'm doing, Tami.
Thanks for asking.

332
00:22:35,197 --> 00:22:38,905
Katie, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Really, I just...

333
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:41,900
I wanted you just to know,
I had no choice.

334
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,194
OK? I had no choice.

335
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:48,323
I would never do that to you,
you are my friend. And I'm so sorry.

336
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:51,047
Well, you do what you had to do.

337
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:55,247
Now you'll forgive me
if I want nothing to do with you, right?

338
00:22:57,491 --> 00:22:58,492
Yes.

339
00:23:09,114 --> 00:23:11,120
Read back what we have so far.

340
00:23:12,346 --> 00:23:16,060
OK. "Facing the challenges
of being student body president"

341
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,813
"has helped me develop skills..."

342
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,482
"an appreciation..."

343
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:25,336
- "... tion"...
- When did you become so mean?

344
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:28,238
You obviously don't believe
any of what you're saying.

345
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,031
Why don't you tell me what to write?

346
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:32,742
- This is your essay!
- Should I write about my trashy family?

347
00:23:32,965 --> 00:23:34,899
About the fact
that my sister's a stripper,

348
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:36,830
or my mom is a high school drop-out

349
00:23:37,295 --> 00:23:40,167
who drinks boxes of wine
like it's water?

350
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,156
Or about the fact that I lost
my virginity when I was 13?

351
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:45,880
Or the fact that my papa wasn't around?
How about that?

352
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,932
I know what I should write about!
The fact that up until 2 years ago,

353
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:53,389
I had enough hate in my heart
to start a frikking car!

354
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:02,648
What changed?

355
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:05,608
- What?
- What changed from 2 years ago?

356
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:09,028
Why did you stop having enough hate
in your heart to start a frikking car?

357
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:15,831
Jason Street got paralyzed.

358
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:24,177
I realized that...

359
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,074
He was this great guy,
I mean, like, this hero.

360
00:24:29,981 --> 00:24:31,634
And it happened to him?

361
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:36,239
And it made me realize that...

362
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:39,852
life isn't fair for anybody.

363
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,249
Not just me.

364
00:24:45,203 --> 00:24:46,482
Uh-huh, and what else?

365
00:24:47,461 --> 00:24:48,834
I don't know, I...

366
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:51,154
became friends with Julie,

367
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,700
and Mrs. Taylor started
to take some interest in me,

368
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,728
I started doing my homework...

369
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:00,456
You.

370
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:04,067
I met you.

371
00:25:07,543 --> 00:25:11,233
I started to feel like I was
on the inside instead of the outside.

372
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:22,894
What are you doing next year?

373
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,855
Guess I'm going
to San Antonio State.

374
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,609
Does that mean...
Are you excited about that?

375
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:31,708
Am I excited?

376
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,197
I guess I'm kind of focusing
on tomorrow and...

377
00:25:37,322 --> 00:25:39,287
don't really wanna look
that far ahead, you know?

378
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:41,708
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

379
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:48,253
It's a Frisbee!

380
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:51,424
You're sure you wanna touch that, 7?
It's probably covered in dog piss.

381
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:54,635
It's not covered in dog piss!
It's just a Frisbee.

382
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:02,852
Last game, 7!

383
00:26:04,974 --> 00:26:06,170
No regrets.

384
00:26:14,716 --> 00:26:17,609
What are you doing over there, running
in place or something? Come on, now.

385
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:20,494
- I can't get comfortable.
- Well, I can't either.

386
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,238
Come here.

387
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:35,194
- What are you doing?
- Come with me outside, come on.

388
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,840
Put your shoes on.

389
00:26:43,522 --> 00:26:44,847
It didn't go off.

390
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:12,628
I have no idea
what's gonna happen tomorrow, babe.

391
00:27:15,913 --> 00:27:18,013
Well, you're gonna win.

392
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,254
Or you're gonna lose.

393
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:29,313
Either way, the sun's gonna
come up the next morning.

394
00:27:37,284 --> 00:27:38,661
"Two years ago,"

395
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,735
"I was afraid of wanting anything."

396
00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:44,381
"I figured wanting
would lead to trying,"

397
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:46,705
"and trying would lead to failure."

398
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:49,530
"But now I find
I can't stop wanting."

399
00:27:50,174 --> 00:27:52,461
"I wanna fly somewhere
in first class."

400
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:55,500
"I wanna travel to Europe
on a business trip."

401
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,037
"I wanna get invited
to the White House."

402
00:27:58,162 --> 00:28:01,303
"I wanna learn about the world.
I wanna surprise myself."

403
00:28:02,331 --> 00:28:05,683
"I wanna be important.
I wanna be the best person I can be."

404
00:28:07,668 --> 00:28:11,188
"I wanna define myself
instead of having others define me."

405
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:16,317
"I wanna win
and have people be happy for me."

406
00:28:17,013 --> 00:28:18,737
"I wanna lose and get over it."

407
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:22,164
"I wanna not be afraid
of the unknown."

408
00:28:24,253 --> 00:28:27,434
"I wanna grow up to be
generous and big hearted,"

409
00:28:28,371 --> 00:28:30,707
"the way that people
have been with me."

410
00:28:33,956 --> 00:28:36,477
"I want an interesting
and surprising life."

411
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:43,851
"It's not that I think
I'm gonna get all these things."

412
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:47,474
"I just want the possibility
of getting them."

413
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:51,347
"College represents possibility."

414
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:56,954
"The possibility
that things are gonna change."

415
00:28:59,393 --> 00:29:00,613
"I can't wait."

416
00:29:12,257 --> 00:29:13,680
What'd you think?

417
00:29:23,456 --> 00:29:25,001
I thought it was...

418
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:26,603
unbelievable.

419
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:30,214
It's great.

420
00:29:35,347 --> 00:29:37,065
I think it's great, too.

421
00:30:28,218 --> 00:30:30,532
Let me just ask you one question.

422
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,824
- Can you play like champions?
- Yes, sir!

423
00:30:35,456 --> 00:30:36,833
Let's go get 'em.

424
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:42,047
<i>It's the Texas 5A
State Championship,</i>

425
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,965
<i>the Dillon Panthers
facing the South Texas Titans</i>

426
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:47,843
<i>in what looks like a real
David and Goliath match-up.</i>

427
00:30:47,968 --> 00:30:51,639
<i>The Titans have scored early and often
on their way to an unbeaten season,</i>

428
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,804
<i>and they're as big and as fast
as anyone has ever seen.</i>

429
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:55,937
Tails!

430
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:57,629
We called "tails."

431
00:30:57,754 --> 00:31:00,189
<i>The Titans have won the toss,
elected to receive,</i>

432
00:31:00,462 --> 00:31:02,108
<i>and Coach Taylor hopes his defense</i>

433
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,070
<i>can hold the Titans
on this first possession.</i>

434
00:31:12,567 --> 00:31:13,913
<i>Titans on offense.</i>

435
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,082
<i>Quarterback drops back to pass...
He throws deep!</i>

436
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,711
<i>And true to form,</i>

437
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,770
<i>six points on the board in a hurry.</i>

438
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:30,543
Come on!

439
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,265
<i>All of the Panthers' hopes
are riding on the shoulders</i>

440
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,379
<i>of the freshman phenom, J.D. McCoy.</i>

441
00:31:41,105 --> 00:31:42,339
<i>He drops back...</i>

442
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:43,974
<i>Pressure's on...</i>

443
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,237
- <i>He gets taken down hard!</i>
- All right!

444
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:50,058
<i>McCoy drops back...</i>

445
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,533
<i>He looks for a receiver downfield...</i>

446
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,908
<i>Interception! It's picked up,
and he can walk that one in...</i>

447
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:00,500
- <i>Touchdown number 2!</i>
- Goddamn it!

448
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:03,128
Come on, guys!

449
00:32:05,195 --> 00:32:08,633
- Seriously, just run your routes!
- Look 'em up before you throw the ball.

450
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:11,146
I'm not getting
no time out there, Coach!

451
00:32:18,235 --> 00:32:19,811
<i>J.D. drops back...</i>

452
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:21,109
<i>He looks...</i>

453
00:32:21,697 --> 00:32:23,440
<i>He's running out of time...</i>

454
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,693
<i>He just gets that one off...</i>

455
00:32:26,942 --> 00:32:28,278
<i>It's incomplete.</i>

456
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:30,655
<i>Titans on the blitz...</i>

457
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,607
<i>And he goes down again!</i>

458
00:32:35,507 --> 00:32:38,747
<i>McCoy back to pass...
He better get rid of it!</i>

459
00:32:40,347 --> 00:32:43,668
<i>And he's sacked for another loss,
as the Titans make J.D.</i>

460
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:45,819
<i>pay for his inexperience.</i>

461
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,719
Come on, you guys!

462
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:50,382
- Gimme the time to throw the ball!
- Relax!

463
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:51,842
Huddle up, right now!

464
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:53,511
- Huddle up!
- J.D.!

465
00:32:54,145 --> 00:32:56,733
- J.D., come here!
- What, Coach? What do you want?

466
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:58,767
You settle down.
Don't you talk to me like that.

467
00:32:59,014 --> 00:33:01,937
Second of all, you settle down.
We've got a lot of game ahead of us.

468
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,960
You understand me? Look at me
when you say that! Do you understand me?

469
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,121
- Yes, sir!
- Let's go.

470
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:10,612
<i>First half is almost over,</i>

471
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,322
<i>and Taylor would really love
to get something on the board</i>

472
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,991
<i>and go into the locker room
on a positive note.</i>

473
00:33:17,022 --> 00:33:18,787
<i>McCoy drops back...</i>

474
00:33:22,107 --> 00:33:23,874
<i>He's got Riggins in the end zone...</i>

475
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:29,506
<i>Hit thrown, and it is intercepted!
The Titans have it.</i>

476
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,384
<i>He has got a ton of room,
one man to beat...</i>

477
00:33:32,874 --> 00:33:35,103
<i>and he is off to the races!</i>

478
00:33:35,228 --> 00:33:38,386
<i>That is the second Titan touchdown</i>

479
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:40,592
<i>off a Panther turnover.</i>

480
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:50,527
- Aren't you proud of the image?
- Damn good! You're good!

481
00:33:51,008 --> 00:33:52,612
You give me no protection.
None!

482
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:54,698
God, guys! Come on!

483
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:17,917
All right, listen up.

484
00:34:23,565 --> 00:34:24,715
We need more.

485
00:34:25,952 --> 00:34:28,147
Offensive line, you look like
you're on roller skates.

486
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,696
We have got to stay in our splits!

487
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:33,278
Everyone has got
to come off the ball!

488
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:36,155
Backside, you have got
to pick up the stunts.

489
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,617
Coach Spivey, we're gonna readjust.
Base defense, press coverage.

490
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:43,574
We are not gonna allow any
more big plays tonight, gentlemen!

491
00:34:49,243 --> 00:34:51,474
What are you looking at?
You wanna be on that field so bad?

492
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,424
- Yes, sir.
- Well, then, show me something!

493
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:59,054
J.D., you're out.

494
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:03,808
Matt, change up your pads,
you're in.

495
00:35:04,378 --> 00:35:06,269
There's a fight going on
out there, gentlemen.

496
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:08,334
Why don't you get in it!

497
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,422
- Clear eyes, full hearts...
- Can't lose!

498
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:30,803
<i>Only 24 minutes of football
left in this season</i>

499
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,920
<i>as the Panthers take the field.</i>

500
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,508
<i>Let's hope they've learned their lessons
from the mistakes of the first half.</i>

501
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:51,438
<i>And the second half</i>

502
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,862
<i>is under way.</i>

503
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,262
<i>Panthers have it at the 5.</i>

504
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,228
<i>He brings it out to the 10...</i>

505
00:35:58,686 --> 00:35:59,838
<i>to the 20...</i>

506
00:35:59,963 --> 00:36:02,062
<i>He's got some room to the 30!</i>

507
00:36:02,253 --> 00:36:04,786
- <i>He's got a head of steam!</i>
- Go, baby, go!

508
00:36:05,495 --> 00:36:06,746
<i>To the 40...</i>

509
00:36:07,135 --> 00:36:09,833
<i>And Landry Clarke
puts an incredible block,</i>

510
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,294
and the Panthers have it at the 40,

511
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,754
<i>the 30...
He could go all the way!</i>

512
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:17,173
<i>Touchdown, Panthers!</i>

513
00:36:23,873 --> 00:36:25,704
We started right, gentlemen!

514
00:36:26,805 --> 00:36:29,448
<i>In a huge reversal,
Coach Taylor has gone back</i>

515
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:32,063
<i>to veteran QB Matt Saracen,</i>

516
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,765
<i>trying to get his Panthers
back in this game.</i>

517
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,276
<i>He dumps a screen pass
off to Riggins.</i>

518
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,696
<i>Riggins has got some blockers
in front of him...</i>

519
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,031
<i>He breaks one tackle,
he's into the end zone...</i>

520
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:46,119
<i>Stiff arm!
And touchdown, Panthers!</i>

521
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:50,040
<i>And the Panthers
have come out firing</i>

522
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,877
<i>by putting 14 unanswered
points on the board.</i>

523
00:36:58,785 --> 00:37:00,924
<i>Saracen with a play-action pass...</i>

524
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:02,346
<i>He looks...</i>

525
00:37:02,726 --> 00:37:05,764
<i>Oh, and he takes off,
and look at him go!</i>

526
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,527
<i>He breaks a tackle...</i>

527
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,267
<i>and another...</i>

528
00:37:09,566 --> 00:37:11,396
<i>Touchdown, Panthers!</i>

529
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,898
<i>And Coach Taylor's
move to the old offense</i>

530
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,722
<i>has his team a touchdown
from the lead!</i>

531
00:37:17,847 --> 00:37:21,205
We have to do the same thing,
all right? Same thing!

532
00:37:23,903 --> 00:37:25,741
<i>Vice quarterback back to pass...</i>

533
00:37:26,484 --> 00:37:28,494
<i>And intercepted by the Panthers!</i>

534
00:37:28,937 --> 00:37:32,290
<i>With less than 2 minutes to play,
the Panthers have the ball</i>

535
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,766
<i>on the Titan 30-yard line.</i>

536
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:37,628
<i>A touchdown and a conversion
gives them the lead.</i>

537
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:40,948
Blue, 80.

538
00:37:41,992 --> 00:37:42,993
Hut!

539
00:37:43,465 --> 00:37:46,386
<i>Saracen takes the snap
and pitches off to Riggins.</i>

540
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:48,078
<i>Riggins runs right...</i>

541
00:37:48,203 --> 00:37:49,891
<i>and he's looking to pass!</i>

542
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:51,925
<i>And he throws deep...</i>

543
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:59,067
<i>and he's got Matt Saracen
on the logo! Touchdown!</i>

544
00:37:59,749 --> 00:38:01,562
<i> Unbelievable, folks!</i>

545
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:05,240
<i>The Panthers have taken
the lead with just</i>

546
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,693
<i>over a minute and a half to play!</i>

547
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:08,851
There we go!

548
00:38:08,976 --> 00:38:11,037
- That was all good.
- That's how you goal.

549
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,168
<i>The Panther fans are celebrating
like they have the game won,</i>

550
00:38:18,706 --> 00:38:21,645
<i>but as the Titans
and Coach Taylor well know,</i>

551
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:25,635
<i>the game is not over
until the final whistle blows.</i>

552
00:38:27,877 --> 00:38:29,637
<i>Thirty-seven seconds
left in the game,</i>

553
00:38:29,762 --> 00:38:32,382
<i>and the Titans are driving
down the field.</i>

554
00:38:32,872 --> 00:38:34,299
<i>Davis back to pass...</i>

555
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:36,627
<i>a quick slant, and he's got it!</i>

556
00:38:36,752 --> 00:38:38,731
<i>The Titans are into
Panther territory.</i>

557
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:40,358
Inside, play inside!

558
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:44,571
<i>All on the Panther 45
as the Titans approach the line.</i>

559
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,115
Bring 'em inside!

560
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,408
<i>There's the snap.</i>

561
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,162
- No! Down! Down, no!
- <i>He is gonna run... </i>

562
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,256
- Stay in there!
- <i>He picks up a block,</i>

563
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:57,751
<i>and he is sprung to the 40
and wrestled down</i>

564
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,837
<i>at the Panther 36.
It's a hurry-up offense.</i>

565
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,505
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

566
00:39:04,015 --> 00:39:07,011
White! You have
got to stay in there!

567
00:39:07,491 --> 00:39:09,222
<i>Davis is back to pass...</i>

568
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,990
<i>He's got a man...
Oh, and it is complete</i>

569
00:39:12,115 --> 00:39:14,434
<i>at the Panther 19-yard line!</i>

570
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,198
<i>This is it, folks.</i>

571
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:20,482
<i>Just 6 seconds left, and this game
comes down to one last play.</i>

572
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:23,471
<i>The Titans are going
for the field goal.</i>

573
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,946
<i>Bad news for the Panthers,
the Titans' kicker</i>

574
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,869
<i>hasn't missed
from this range all year.</i>

575
00:39:29,148 --> 00:39:33,096
<i>This has been a valiant
effort by the Dillon Panthers.</i>

576
00:41:30,008 --> 00:41:33,763
I wanted everyone's friends and family
to be in here to hear this, gentlemen.

577
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:36,159
I have never...

578
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:39,579
been more proud of a team
than I am right now.

579
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,567
I am in awe of each
and every one of you gentlemen.

580
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,795
You played great football tonight.

581
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:55,623
This is the game...

582
00:41:57,058 --> 00:41:59,928
that people are gonna talk about
for years to come.

583
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,434
This is the game
you're gonna talk about.

584
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,274
There's not a single person in this room
that's ever gonna be the same.

585
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,082
You be proud of yourselves...

586
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,043
'cause gentlemen,

587
00:42:23,645 --> 00:42:25,219
you are champions.

588
00:43:33,887 --> 00:43:35,174
Is that everybody?

589
00:43:35,432 --> 00:43:37,470
No, Riggins hasn't made it on yet.

590
00:43:39,354 --> 00:43:41,250
Want me to send somebody out there?

591
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:44,575
No, let's give him a minute.

592
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,790
He'll be here.

593
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:37,270
<i>From a small town</i>

594
00:45:37,438 --> 00:45:39,177
<i>in the heart of Texas,</i>

<i>the lives we've come to know</i>

596

<i>Dreams realized.</i>

598

<i>Dreams lost.</i>
