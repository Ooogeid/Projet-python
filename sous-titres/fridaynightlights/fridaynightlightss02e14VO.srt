1
00:00:00,463 --> 00:00:03,331
I don't think we should be together
anymore. This is over.

2
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:07,185
We want you
to play football for us at TMU.

3
00:00:07,345 --> 00:00:09,796
Hey, y'all,
the Smash is going for the U, baby!

4
00:00:11,432 --> 00:00:12,716
Leave my sister alone.

5
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:15,718
You got one of ours,
why shouldn't we get one of yours?

6
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:18,555
They've decided to suspend you

7
00:00:18,815 --> 00:00:21,516
- for three games.
- That's the rest of the regular season.

8
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:23,393
- Where you going?
- Guatemala.

9
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:26,730
I love you, and you love me.
I know that.

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,107
I don't understand why you'd be leaving.
It doesn't make any sense.

11
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:33,737
She had to leave a day early.
She really wanted to tell you good-bye.

12
00:00:36,855 --> 00:00:38,700
Don't burn my sausages.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,785
You know I like
those Jimmy Deans tender.

14
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:43,567
I'm not making sausages, grandma.
I'm making eggs.

15
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:46,541
I want french toast.
Carlotta says tuesdays

16
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:49,315
- are french toast tuesdays.
- Carlotta's not here,

17
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:51,479
so we're not gonna
be having...

18
00:00:51,888 --> 00:00:53,305
Oh, my lord!

19
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:58,511
You cut my toast
in those little triangles I like.

20
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:01,890
- Yep. Just for you.
- That looks so good, boy.

21
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:03,807
Here you go.

22
00:01:06,564 --> 00:01:08,950
You just wait till
she comes back, though.

23
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,052
She's not gonna come back,
grandma.

24
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:13,467
Well...

25
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:16,311
- We'll see.
- Yep. We will.

26
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:19,683
You do a good job.

27
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:20,981
Thank you.

28
00:01:27,342 --> 00:01:28,740
Why did she leave?

29
00:01:34,023 --> 00:01:35,171
I don't know.

30
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:40,441
Well...
We are just fine.

31
00:01:44,997 --> 00:01:47,540
- I love you.
- I love you too. Have a good day.

32
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,812
Be good.

33
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,543
I'll try.

34
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:56,659
At what time are your hands
on the wheel?

35
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:57,861
10:00 and 2:00.

36
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:01,371
Don't roll your eyes at me.
You're gonna need them for the road.

37
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:04,725
And when you disrespect the vehicle,
accidents happen, understood?

38
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:07,183
So when I start driving,
can you not be in my car?

39
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:09,711
What's the speed limit
in a residential area?

40
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:11,537
It depends on how many people I hit.

41
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:13,468
Really funny.
You know what else's funny?

42
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:15,960
You waving from a little window
of a big yellow bus.

43
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,688
- You've seen my volleyball shoes?
- Where you left 'em, honey.

44
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,147
Thank you, sweetie.

45
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,301
30 miles an hour in a residential area
unless otherwise marked.

46
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:26,055
And what's this state's
legal alcohol limit?

47
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:27,206
.08, dad.

48
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:30,108
For those over 21.
But for you it's zero.

49
00:02:30,268 --> 00:02:32,856
I catch any alcohol and you
together in a vehicle,

50
00:02:33,116 --> 00:02:35,017
and I promise
you will never drive again.

51
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:39,164
Honey, I think you need to back off her.
I'm gonna take her for her test.

52
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,128
Fine. You wanna fire me?
Good. I'll be in the bathroom.

53
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:45,035
- TMI, dad.
- Maybe my shoes are in the car.

54
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:02,457
<i>Call it D-day in Dillon.</i>

55
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:03,911
<i>The news is out.</i>

56
00:03:04,071 --> 00:03:06,916
<i>The district board
has suspended Smash Williams</i>

57
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:08,999
<i>for the remainder of the season.</i>

58
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:11,669
<i>The board will not comment
on their decision.</i>

59
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:14,077
<i>With Smash suspended,
it's hard to envision</i>

60
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:16,649
<i>how these Panthers can make it
through the next three games</i>

61
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:18,411
<i>to make the playoffs.</i>

62
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:21,986

66
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,100

67
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,451

73
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:55,001
This blows.
Can't get it done without Smash.

74
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,018
We might as well kiss playoffs good-bye.

75
00:04:57,178 --> 00:04:58,939
You know what's gonna help
get us to State?

76
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,714
- To keep whining like that.
- Oh, you gonna get us there solo?

77
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:04,674
Nice play, man.
Thanks.

78
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:07,018
You know what?
I did what I did.

79
00:05:07,178 --> 00:05:08,624
I don't have to explain myself...

80
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:11,420
- Shut up! It's done.
- That's what I'm sayin'.

81
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:14,517
You shut up too.
You don't have to talk always.

82
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:17,213
Sit down. Take your seat.
Riggs, get a seat.

83
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:18,521
Listen up, guys.

84
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:24,193
Smash is suspended
for three games.

85
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:27,322
This... is about

86
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:29,431
more than just football,
gentlemen.

87
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:33,036
It's about adversity
and how we stand up to it.

88
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:36,664
No one said they were gonna
hand us the playoffs.

89
00:05:36,824 --> 00:05:38,981
What we are gonna do
is we're gonna work,

90
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:42,108
we're gonna adjust,
and we're gonna work some more.

91
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:44,672
We're gonna take adversity,
turn it into an asset,

92
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:47,823
and we're gonna ride that asset
all the way to the damn playoffs.

93
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:49,729
That's gonna start
with the team captains.

94
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,473
What the hell happened to you?

95
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,394
You look like hell, son.

96
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:57,690
Here we go. Coach Crowley,
you wanna take us through it?

97
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,688
This is their red zone offense,
their motions and trips.

98
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:02,998
Let's talk about
these still lifes.

99
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:07,487
Why don't you start?

100
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:11,832
You can talk about your own drawing
or you can critique someone else's.

101
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:14,501
They're okay.

102
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,142
Can you elaborate on that?

103
00:06:17,514 --> 00:06:20,625
Talk about the composition,
value, accuracy.

104
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:22,680
They're all okay.

105
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,047
Art is more than just drawing.

106
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:27,808
We need to analyze the work,

107
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:30,863
talk about why a drawing
is successful or not.

108
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:33,137
Do you think you succeeded?

109
00:06:33,397 --> 00:06:35,932
In drawing a vase of flowers?
Yes, I think I did.

110
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:37,903
Okay, why?

111
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:40,098
Because I can tell that it's a vase,

112
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:42,468
and I can tell that
there's flowers in it.

113
00:06:44,114 --> 00:06:47,110
I'd like you to work a little harder
at your critique in the future.

114
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,577
Bitch.

115
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:54,782
Excuse me?

116
00:06:55,778 --> 00:06:56,952
What did you say?

117
00:06:57,213 --> 00:06:59,832
My critique is that we're drawing

118
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:03,418
a bunch of sad, stupid pictures
of sad and stupid flowers.

119
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,403
And I said bitch.

120
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:15,406
Where you going?

121
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:18,404
Matt, we have spanish
class in diez minutos.

122
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,564
Screw it.

123
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:22,006
Do you at least want me
to tell 'em that you got sick?

124
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,404
I don't care.

125
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:34,088
Jean.

126
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,076
Right. You and Landry
do that physics thing together, right?

127
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:38,339
Right.

128
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,979
- I don't want this to be weird.
- You don't want what to be weird?

129
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:44,452
Are you a friend, or are you competion?

130
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:45,958
Competition?

131
00:07:48,437 --> 00:07:50,840
Oh, my God.
Are you talking about Landry?

132
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,306
'Cause I like him.
I think he's great,

133
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:58,139
and I'm not blind to see
the way he looks at you.

134
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,561
I just wanted to make sure
nothing's happening there.

135
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:01,955
We're just friends.

136
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:05,104
Great. 'cause I'm telling you
I like him.

137
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:09,317
Good. For you.
That's great.

138
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:11,027
Go for it.
He's a great guy.

139
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:14,572
I gotta get to practice.

140
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:15,872
See you later.

141
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:24,082
Hang 'em.
One thousand.

142
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:25,708
One...
One thousand.

143
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:27,877
Two...
One thousand.

144
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:32,173
- Where the hell's Saracen?
- I don't see him.

145
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,569
- Well, get him down here.
- All right.

146
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:36,886
- How's Lance's knee?
- He's out for a while.

147
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:39,767
- How'd he do that?
- He tripped over a curb.

148
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:41,778
Tripped over a curb.

149
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:46,182
- Take over.
- Yes, sir

150
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:49,378
Coach, I know I'm suspended,
but I really want to be out here.

151
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:52,935
I appreciate you suitin' up.

152
00:08:53,095 --> 00:08:55,488
You're a good captain.
You are a good team leader.

153
00:08:57,106 --> 00:08:59,283
Right now, I need to work
this team out here

154
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:01,156
today, without you.

155
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:04,197
You understand
what I'm saying?

156
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:11,483
- I'm gonna go do weights.
- That a boy.

157
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,216
Let's go.
Stretch 'em out good.

158
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,761
Saracen's not here.

159
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:21,430
I know he's not here.
Where the hell is he?

160
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,975
Landry said he's home
and he's sick.

161
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,614
Landry, Saracen, Smash.

162
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:31,204
All right, listen up!

163
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:33,806
Here's what we're gonna do.

164
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:36,163
First string,
I want Brooks and Westin

165
00:09:36,323 --> 00:09:37,964
in for Smash and Saracen.

166
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:39,574
Coaches, get 'em together.

167
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:41,909
Let's go.
We got a lotta work to do.

168
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:45,249
Good lord, what are you
talking about, Brooks for Smash?

169
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:47,068
Brooks for Smash.

170
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,984
All right.
All right.

171
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:51,127
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- G.C, get 'em together!

172
00:09:57,393 --> 00:10:00,353
- What are you doing?
- I have a surprise for you.

173
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:02,149
- What?
- I found the mother lode.

174
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:05,045
Mystery science theater
3000 short forms on youtube.

175
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:07,810
- There's at least, like 50 of 'em.
- Are you serious?

176
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,229
- Excited?
- Don't mess with me, that wouldn't

177
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:12,113
- be funny.
- I wouldn't lie to you.

178
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:14,650
That pretty much takes
care of the entire weekend.

179
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,652
At least, let's try
to stretch this out.

180
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:19,522
We have to watch them
in order, like alphabetical order

181
00:10:19,682 --> 00:10:22,480
- or some other crazy kind of order.
- We'll come up with something.

182
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,993
We'll figure it out.

183
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:30,587
- It'll be fun.
- I'm gonna have to prop my leg up.

184
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:33,827
It really takes
a good technique to...

185
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:35,681
sit on the bench.

186
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:38,929
You think you could possibly
bring some ice?

187
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,779
The doctor said
I'm supposed to ice it.

188
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,660
20 minutes on,
20 minutes off.

189
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,693
That sounds like
a great weekend.

190
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,168
I hope I'm invited.

191
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:51,077
You know, I keep telling her
to run a back slide,

192
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:53,686
and every single time,
she's gonna set it up high

193
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:56,033
and outside...
Every single time without fail.

194
00:10:56,193 --> 00:10:57,885
You didn't hear this from me,

195
00:10:58,045 --> 00:11:00,342
but Catherine's not
gonna set to Megan anymore,

196
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:04,075
'cause Megan started
seeing her ex, Jimbo.

197
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:05,857
- Good grief.
- I know.

198
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:08,064
- Dinner was really good.
- Thank you, sweetie.

199
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:10,775
Those mashed potatoes
were unbelievable.

200
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:12,750
The butter.
I know, I know.

201
00:11:14,636 --> 00:11:17,109
Mrs. T.,
can if I ask you a question?

202
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,382
Is it insane
if I feel a little jealous

203
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:22,264
that some girl
likes Landry Clarke?

204
00:11:23,694 --> 00:11:25,680
Lance Landry clarke?

205
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:30,880
I don't know.
I mean, do you like Landry Clarke?

206
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,396
No, it's nothing like that.

207
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:35,210
It's just that
this girl Jean,

208
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,571
she asked my permission
to start seeing him and...

209
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:42,231
I said yes. Not that she needs
my permission or anything.

210
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:45,622
It's affecting me so much,
I feel like I'm going crazy.

211
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:48,452
I had a boy like that
in high school, Scott Hunter.

212
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:50,496
And he was real nerdy,
you know...

213
00:11:50,756 --> 00:11:52,535
- She doesn't need to...
- She asked.

214
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,542
I thought he was so sweet.

215
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:58,414
He had the biggest crush on me,
and it felt good, and I liked that.

216
00:11:58,574 --> 00:12:01,350
So I let it go on a little while,
but finally I realized:

217
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,653
It's not fair.

218
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:04,851
The fair thing to do,
the kind thing to do

219
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:06,301
is to let him go.

220
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:09,205
Good guys always finish last.
That's what she's trying to say.

221
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:12,811
It's not, 'cause look at you.
You finished first, didn't you?

222
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:15,586
- I don't know about that!
- Well, I do. Look deep in your soul.

223
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:18,733
Tyra, do you wanna go do our precalc?
We can finish it up.

224
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:23,231
You know what?
I actually have to get going.

225
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:25,671
But I'll see you
at school tomorrow?

226
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:30,278
- Thank you for dinner. It was amazing.
- Of course, honey, and let me tell you.

227
00:12:30,438 --> 00:12:32,663
You are doing a great job.
I'm so proud of you.

228
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:34,957
- See you tomorrow at practice.
- Thanks, Mrs. T.

229
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:37,244
- Keep it up! Bye.
- Bye, guys.

230
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:39,795
- Bye, hon. Get home safely.
- Bye, coach.

231
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:41,056
Okay.

232
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:51,521
Honey, we should go
on vacation, just the two of us.

233
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:52,947
You know what I mean?

234
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,354
Now that Gracie girl's
getting a little older.

235
00:12:55,544 --> 00:12:57,189
We could leave her
with my sister.

236
00:12:57,349 --> 00:13:01,041
Honey, haven't we been planning
that same vacation for 16 years now?

237
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:02,599
I'm just sayin'.

238
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:05,194
You gonna come to
my volleyball game?

239
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:07,615
I wouldn't miss it
for anything in the world.

240
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:11,501
I have to say, I'm having
such a good time with this coaching.

241
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:14,163
I mean,
it's so satisfying.

242
00:13:14,423 --> 00:13:18,412
Because it's nice to have some
teenage girls listen to me for a change.

243
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:20,002
That's probably
what it is.

244
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:26,634
You realize that
Julie's a bit envious, don't you?

245
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:30,463
What, you mean of the volleyball thing?
Julie hates volleyball, sweetie.

246
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:33,284
I understand, but you gotta understand
how sensitive she is too.

247
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:37,950
Sweetheart, who knows how sensitive
our dear daughter is more than me?

248
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:40,464
You're barking up the wrong tree.

249
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:43,465
I may be barking up the wrong tree.
I just thought I'd say something.

250
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:47,023
- Envious?
- I just wanted you to keep it in mind.

251
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:02,643
If you're thinking about
grabbing the world by the berries

252
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:04,945
and lighting your own fire,
that's what you need.

253
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:07,250
- No, it's cool, I...
- Sit on it.

254
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,994
- It's a little out of my price range.
- That's the old you talking. Get on it.

255
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:13,556
Give it a burn.

256
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:18,477
If you feed that baby right,
you'll never get off.

257
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:20,627
- I know. This...
- Looks good.

258
00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:23,640
I'm gonna go get the key.
I'll be right back. Take your time.

259
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:32,823
QB one...

260
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:34,973
Skippin' school again.

261
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:36,616
Yeah, well,

262
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,986
yesterday's kinda turned
into today, so...

263
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:41,917
- What about you?
- I always skip wednesdays.

264
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,368
Seriously, what's the deal
with the bike, though?

265
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:47,214
Nothin'.

266
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:51,802
- What are you gonna do?
- I was thinkin', hit the museum,

267
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:54,179
yoga, library for a bit.

268
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:57,153
Then again, I might just do the "ushz."

269
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:03,856
Wanna go for a beer?

270
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,971
How did you know that we weren't
gonna get carded here?

271
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:17,147
Charlie? He'll never card me.
I mean, he's old school.

272
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:24,838
So coach was pretty rattled
at you yesterday,

273
00:15:24,998 --> 00:15:26,221
not showin' up.

274
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,895
- Gonna show up today or what?
- No. No, I'm not.

275
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:31,824
I'm not done being dumped.

276
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,898
You know what was good about
the way I got dumped though?

277
00:15:36,058 --> 00:15:38,352
Carlotta, she just dumped me.

278
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:40,601
She just left a note on the pillow

279
00:15:40,861 --> 00:15:42,311
and left the country.

280
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:44,522
Over.
Like the breakup fairy.

281
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:56,526
- You want a funnel or... You know?
- No, I just...

282
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,453
I wanna be more like you.

283
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:01,841
It doesn't matter.
Smash is off the team.

284
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:04,316
The season's done.
You're fine, that's fine.

285
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:08,072
You can get any girl you want.
You get all the girls, whatever.

286
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:10,756
And nothing matters.
You're just always... the same.

287
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:13,602
Even-keeled.
That's what I wanna be able to do.

288
00:16:13,762 --> 00:16:16,161
I wanna be able to be even-keeled.
Always.

289
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:19,909
Look at these two bible thumpers.

290
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:24,492
They come here every day for lunch.
Isn't that sad?

291
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,190
It's sad if you ask me.

292
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:28,983
Stalkin's sad if you ask me.

293
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,631
All right. Stay here.
I'll be right back.

294
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:36,751
Burger...

295
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:41,871
What's going on?
How you guys doing?

296
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,499
- Can I help you?
- Tim Riggins.

297
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:49,295
It is a pleasure. It really is.
You have great hair.

298
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:52,840
The other night, you were brilliant.
That sermon you did...

299
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,641
- Tim, please.
- I appreciate that.

300
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:56,941
I'm glad you were there.
You should come back.

301
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:58,948
- Anytime.
- Might just have to.

302
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:01,518
- You look great.
- She does.

303
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:04,083
- You both look great. Together.
- Thank you.

304
00:17:06,384 --> 00:17:08,606
We got a pitcher
if you guys are interested.

305
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:09,876
Shalom.

306
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:14,943
See ya, Garrity.

307
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,045
- Let's go.
- Where we going?

308
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,350
- We're going to practice.
- No, I can't go.

309
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,079
You can. Chug some water.

310
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,998
Corn nuts for the breath.
Let's go.

311
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:31,065
- Eat it!
- Okay.

312
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:33,858
Careful now.

313
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:35,966
Watch both ways very clearly

314
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:37,576
around that corner.

315
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,139
You know what I been wanting
to ask you, hon?

316
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,475
You don't wanna play
on the volleyball team

317
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:47,463
- or anything, do you?
- What? No, I don't.

318
00:17:47,623 --> 00:17:50,731
Careful, he's pulling out right there.
You gotta... Eyes all around.

319
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:54,568
I just wanted to check in with you
about that, about the volleyball.

320
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:57,821
- Have you seen their uniforms?
- Well, yes, I have.

321
00:17:59,164 --> 00:18:01,241
Volleyball's just not my thing,
you know?

322
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:04,169
You're not gonna make me
play or something, are you?

323
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:07,365
Oh. No!
Of course I'm not gonna make you play.

324
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:09,817
Of course I wouldn't do that.
I... There's a red light.

325
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:13,483
There's a red light. Watch...
Ease into your stop. Ease into your...

326
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:17,049
Well, okay, all right.
We're gonna practice that.

327
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:19,286
We'll practice that.

328
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,137
All right!

329
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:24,306
- Come on, let's go out there!
- All right, we're goin'.

330
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:27,478
When I run, you know,
want me to run, I'll run.

331
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:28,856
Ready?

332
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,313
You get me?
Stop smiling. Serious game.

333
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,361
You get it?

334
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:35,465
All right! Set!

335
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:37,413
Blue...

336
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:39,895
Whoa, man!
I'm not your sitter. Come on!

337
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,832
- Let's go!
- We're good. We're good.

338
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:45,061
On your marks!

339
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:46,976
Get set!

340
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:51,709
Overhaul! Do the overhaul!
Red...

341
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,743
The red thing.
You're good... Line up, red.

342
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:58,048
The red, you got that?
You got it? All right!

343
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:01,562
Green 20!

344
00:19:02,317 --> 00:19:04,241
Green 20!
Hut!

345
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,974
Get your ass over here right now!

346
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:09,309
That's a good effort.
Good effort.

347
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:12,275
What's going on?

348
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:14,800
What the hell are you doing?

349
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:17,567
What the hell are you smiling at?

350
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:22,328
Nothin'.
It's been a really bad day,

351
00:19:22,488 --> 00:19:24,616
so I was trying
to have some fun out there.

352
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,115
You get your ass out there,
and you get it together right now.

353
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:36,215
Yes, sir.

354
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:41,914
You smell that?

355
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:46,471
No, I don't.

356
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:52,363
Jean's just such a cool girl.

357
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:55,068
You know,
she really appreciates

358
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,996
all different types of films.

359
00:19:57,224 --> 00:19:59,314
She's really like a film scholar.

360
00:19:59,474 --> 00:20:00,568
I need to decide

361
00:20:00,728 --> 00:20:02,997
which movie is gonna be
more conducive to romance.

362
00:20:03,157 --> 00:20:05,991
Is it gonna be Wrath of Khan
or is it gonna be Jaws?

363
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:08,532
- Does it really matter?
- It does matter.

364
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:11,884
Because this is kinda big for me.
This is gonna decide whether or not

365
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,728
Jean Binnel's gonna pass
through those velvet ropes

366
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:17,336
to becoming my girl,
you know?

367
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:19,880
- You look like you're gonna throw up.
- I'm okay.

368
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:22,049
Are you gonna eat that?

369
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:26,551
You're very dehydrated.
Which happens whenever you get drunk.

370
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,951
- That's why I'm drinking.
- It's called a side-effect.

371
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:30,809
Buddy, Landry.
What's going on?

372
00:20:31,693 --> 00:20:33,268
What's goin' on is
we're gonna be

373
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:35,479
the first team in Texas football history

374
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:38,923
to win the state championship
and not make the playoffs next year,

375
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,527
courtesy of one
Brian "Smash" Williams.

376
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,695
- Good to have you here.
- He's hung over,

377
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:45,823
in case you were wondering.

378
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:48,435
Matty, I'm not happy about this.

379
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:50,981
I'm just trying to keep my head down
and move through it.

380
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:54,353
It's on you and the team to get to the
playoffs so I can get back on the field.

381
00:20:54,513 --> 00:20:55,791
You know what he did?

382
00:20:56,408 --> 00:20:59,628
This guy also ditched school
with Tim Riggins.

383
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:01,922
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

384
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:03,971
- That's your new role model?
- No, it's...

385
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:07,094
I just don't wanna see you
become at-risk youth.

386
00:21:07,354 --> 00:21:10,806
Why don't you discuss what's going on
in Matt Saracen's life?

387
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:12,568
I'm trying to reach out to you,

388
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:14,875
and you're just walking away from me
just like that.

389
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:16,542
Keep walkin', Matt.
Walk away.

390
00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:18,212
Oh, my God.
Stop talking.

391
00:21:18,372 --> 00:21:19,402
Walk away.

392
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:21,904
What do you think?

393
00:21:22,794 --> 00:21:24,743
You think The Wrath of Khan or Jaws

394
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:26,488
for like a date?

395
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:28,969
What?

396
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:32,703
Jaws?

397
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:35,956
Let's go y'all.
You can do it.

398
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:50,596
Work together now! Come on now, y'all.
Call the ball!

399
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:00,939
Beautiful, ya'll.

400
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:11,116
Let's finish it.
Watch their center. Close the block.

401
00:22:11,376 --> 00:22:14,161
Let's do now, y'all. You can do it.
Teamwork! Let's go!

402
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:30,267
That was a victory.
I knew y'all could do it!

403
00:22:30,427 --> 00:22:31,595
I'm so proud of you!

404
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:34,473
- One, two, three!
- Panthers!

405
00:22:35,658 --> 00:22:36,994
Let's go to my house!

406
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:51,316
All right,
who wants a hot fudge sundae?

407
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:55,911
Mrs T?
You had a mullet.

408
00:22:57,532 --> 00:22:58,664
That was a good look.

409
00:22:58,965 --> 00:23:00,790
You didn't like the perm?

410
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:02,621
Mom, I like you in a perm.

411
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,836
I like the way that looks.

412
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:07,370
And you like to dance, don't you?

413
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,548
Thanks.

414
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:11,085
What?

415
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:19,058
Excuse me.

416
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,146
What's goin' on?

417
00:23:25,283 --> 00:23:27,112
Is this what your dad
was talking about?

418
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,444
- I have no idea.
- He said that you were feeling

419
00:23:29,704 --> 00:23:32,072
a little sensitive about me
coaching volleyball.

420
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:33,346
Volleyball.

421
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:35,627
It does seem to me that you
have not been a big fan

422
00:23:35,787 --> 00:23:38,432
of this volleyball situation,
and I know it must be

423
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:40,422
eating up some time
that we have together.

424
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:43,991
But we are gonna have to learn
to deal with the situation

425
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:46,491
without you comin' in
and slamming around.

426
00:23:46,651 --> 00:23:48,171
Sorry. Maybe I'm being rude.

427
00:23:48,431 --> 00:23:51,205
I just believe in mom
when she says I'll see you at the DMV.

428
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,362
Oh, hon...

429
00:23:58,914 --> 00:24:01,863
I waited there an hour.
I tried calling your cell phone.

430
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,645
I tried calling the house.

431
00:24:03,905 --> 00:24:06,168
You're right. I should just work
on my jealousy issues.

432
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,057
Sweetie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

433
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:09,568
I'm so sorry.

434
00:24:21,654 --> 00:24:24,083
- We're closed, ma'am.
- You work here?

435
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,060
Let me ask you something.

436
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,511
You're not supposed to close
for another ten minutes.

437
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:30,942
I shut everything down.
My last appointment left...

438
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,050
My daughter missed
her appointment today

439
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,510
- because of me.
- She can come back tomorrow.

440
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,039
Let me just tell you,
this is my fault...

441
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,214
And I just...

442
00:24:41,626 --> 00:24:43,139
It's just important.

443
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:44,484
I can understand that.

444
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:46,044
If I don't redeem myself,

445
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:49,691
I may not get her to trust me
again for a while, and that's just gonna

446
00:24:50,384 --> 00:24:51,425
be a problem.

447
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,058
Do you have kids?

448
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,360
There are ten minutes...

449
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,824
All right, she can
take the road test today.

450
00:24:58,084 --> 00:25:00,455
- That is so kind.
- But I can't do any of the paperwork

451
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:02,089
- until tomorrow.
- Great.

452
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:05,283
- Are you a Panther's fan?
- No. I hate football.

453
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,594
Okay. Come here, sweetie.

454
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:10,082
Here you go.

455
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,068
Alright. Go get 'em.
You know what you're doing.

456
00:25:15,228 --> 00:25:16,832
That's my daughter Julie.

457
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,856
- Thanks.
- We're gonna make a right over here.

458
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:23,623
Good. Just take it easy.

459
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:28,640
There she goes,
Gracie Bell.

460
00:25:30,346 --> 00:25:32,195
Taking her driver's test.

461
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:36,298
Can't believe it.

462
00:25:41,002 --> 00:25:42,970
Oh, my God.
Honey, can you come over here?

463
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,705
I gotta ask you a serious question.
You see these things on me?

464
00:25:45,966 --> 00:25:47,540
They're like whiskers.
You see them?

465
00:25:48,136 --> 00:25:50,001
Just pay to get a wax, it's easier.

466
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,600
Oh, my God.

467
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:55,510
Mama, did you ever...

468
00:25:56,403 --> 00:25:57,801
compete with a girl over a guy?

469
00:26:00,912 --> 00:26:02,763
Oh, honey,
well, the question is really,

470
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:05,891
did I ever not compete
with a girl over a guy?

471
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:08,688
- Come on, seriously.
- I am serious.

472
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:11,873
I- I like the chase.
I like the challenge, poor girls.

473
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,315
Did you like the guy?

474
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,944
I like to win.

475
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:18,144
Okay, see, that's just sick.

476
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:20,847
I know but I'll tell you something.

477
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:23,639
This whole family, that kinda competion,
it runs in your blood.

478
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:26,371
I just think it's stupid
to compete over something like that.

479
00:26:27,114 --> 00:26:29,260
Well, you're right. It is stupid.

480
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,460
But you're so much more evolved
than your poor mother, thank God.

481
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:34,670
Would you like a diet coke, my daughter?

482
00:26:34,931 --> 00:26:36,016
That's okay.

483
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:45,722
Two more lemon drops!

484
00:26:45,882 --> 00:26:48,559
You like those, right?
You're not gonna puke yet, are ya?

485
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,686
I don't know
why we never do this before.

486
00:26:50,947 --> 00:26:52,473
- Me neither.
- I don't either.

487
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:54,986
'Cause it's good times.
You know what?

488
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,953
Keep drinkin',
I got a surprise for ya.

489
00:26:57,113 --> 00:26:58,652
You gettin' another round?

490
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:10,040
- You see... the rookie right there?
- Yeah.

491
00:27:12,886 --> 00:27:13,876
Hey, Chastity!

492
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:18,756
My treat, my treat.

493
00:27:19,018 --> 00:27:21,342
Take it easy on him.
He's still in high school.

494
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:25,390
He's a cutie pie!

495
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:27,907
Yeah, you like him?

496
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:31,518
Why are those guys
gettin' all the action?

497
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,396
'Cause they're younger
and don't need viagra! Don't touch me.

498
00:27:35,658 --> 00:27:37,250
I'm almost done with high school.

499
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,766
- Really?
- Yes.

500
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:41,821
Here, drink up!

501
00:27:42,281 --> 00:27:43,781
- Drink up!
- Oh, shoot.

502
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,366
That's great.

503
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:49,496
Oh, shoot, I'm vibrating, girl.

504
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,664
You're making me buzz!

505
00:27:53,741 --> 00:27:55,197
You're making me...

506
00:27:57,317 --> 00:27:59,339
- Where you goin'?
- I'm gonna be back.

507
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:01,679
You'll hurt her feelings, Mattie!

508
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,676
7!

509
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,969
You talk to Crowley
about the basic defense?

510
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:06,749
I did. 4-3.

511
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:10,725
Yeah?

512
00:28:14,414 --> 00:28:16,364
I need to talk to you, coach.

513
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:21,026
- I'll, uh... I'll see you in a few.
- All right.

514
00:28:25,377 --> 00:28:26,379
Brian?

515
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:33,175
TMU.

516
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:44,008
They're revoking my scholarship.

517
00:28:46,078 --> 00:28:48,263
It's off the board's decision.
They say I've got...

518
00:28:49,132 --> 00:28:50,705
questionable character.

519
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:54,852
That's the mark of death, coach.

520
00:29:02,177 --> 00:29:03,581
That's my future.

521
00:29:08,464 --> 00:29:10,994
No!
Her name is Lorraine...

522
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:12,397
Saracen.

523
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:14,497
Yes, your hospital left me

524
00:29:14,757 --> 00:29:17,696
many voice mails,
about Lorraine Saracen...

525
00:29:18,878 --> 00:29:21,218
I'm her g-grandson.

526
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,714
Yes! I'm on my way.

527
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:27,850
I guess she...
She hit her head getting out of bed.

528
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,469
Well, I am just so sorry,

529
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,318
pulling you away from your customers.

530
00:29:35,621 --> 00:29:37,671
But I do thank you...

531
00:29:38,384 --> 00:29:39,482
so much.

532
00:29:39,642 --> 00:29:42,975
No, no, no.
Don't worry about it, Matt, it's cool.

533
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:50,483
Actually, I suffer from an illness
which is called selachophobia...

534
00:29:50,643 --> 00:29:53,953
Which is the fear of sharks.
And I would appreciate it if you would,

535
00:29:54,213 --> 00:29:56,895
instead of ridiculing me,
maybe support me a little bit.

536
00:29:57,055 --> 00:29:58,541
Right, so don't be like...

537
00:29:58,802 --> 00:29:59,902
One summer...

538
00:30:00,062 --> 00:30:02,094
- 1,100 boys in the water...
- That's not funny!

539
00:30:02,254 --> 00:30:04,005
Hey, Jean.
Hi.

540
00:30:04,265 --> 00:30:05,298
Hey, Tyra.

541
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:06,867
- How are you doing?
- Good.

542
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,427
Did you...
Did you see <i>Jaws</i> too?

543
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:13,521
Yeah.
Great, great movie.

544
00:30:16,043 --> 00:30:18,002
Can I talk to you for a minute?

545
00:30:18,957 --> 00:30:20,202
- Sure.
- Yeah.

546
00:30:20,657 --> 00:30:22,508
- Yeah. That okay?
- Yeah.

547
00:30:26,069 --> 00:30:27,411
Everything okay?

548
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:32,821
Yeah. This is hard to say,
so I'm just gonna say it. Look...

549
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:35,803
I like you.

550
00:30:38,396 --> 00:30:40,682
You were right, okay?
I do like you.

551
00:30:43,538 --> 00:30:45,188
I wanna give us a shot.

552
00:30:50,995 --> 00:30:53,278
That's what you came here to say, was...

553
00:30:53,903 --> 00:30:54,903
Yeah.

554
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:01,103
I mean, I'm on...
I'm on a date right now...

555
00:31:02,675 --> 00:31:05,254
Tyra, and she's not...
She's not embarrassed of me

556
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:07,945
or to be seen with me.
She actually likes me.

557
00:31:08,105 --> 00:31:10,238
Last time I checked,
you were somewhere in-between.

558
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:12,133
That's not fair, Landry.

559
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:14,381
- You was...
- That's not fair!

560
00:31:15,546 --> 00:31:17,871
We both know how we got together,
and it wasn't exactly

561
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:19,846
under normal circumstances.

562
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:22,583
It was messed up

563
00:31:22,844 --> 00:31:25,723
and scary, and, yeah, I was...
I was confused.

564
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,714
But I'm not now.

565
00:31:34,076 --> 00:31:35,076
Well...

566
00:31:37,484 --> 00:31:38,873
I'm on a date.

567
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,146
Look, I'm sorry.

568
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:46,994
- I don't know what else to say.
- No, no, I... I'm sorry.

569
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:49,610
I'm really sorry.
You... you have a great night.

570
00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:51,678
I'll... I'll see you around.

571
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:58,745
- Ready to get outta here?
- Yeah.

572
00:32:05,712 --> 00:32:06,742
Let's go.

573
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:18,504
Brian?

574
00:32:18,957 --> 00:32:19,957
Baby?

575
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:22,892
What you doing?
You been in here all night.

576
00:32:23,128 --> 00:32:26,636
This is all my TMU stuff.
The pamphlets, the posters, the gear...

577
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:29,067
I'm gettin' rid of it,
'cause it's over, mama.

578
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:31,921
It's over.

579
00:32:35,377 --> 00:32:37,157
You wanna tell me I told ya so?

580
00:32:39,385 --> 00:32:40,385
No.

581
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:46,052
I just wanna let you know
I love you.

582
00:32:46,743 --> 00:32:48,248
Oh, I love you.

583
00:32:50,086 --> 00:32:51,380
And I believe in you.

584
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:55,607
I believe in you.

585
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:19,274
Coach.
Sorry for calling you.

586
00:33:19,434 --> 00:33:21,758
No, I appreciate it.
What's going on?

587
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,787
We didn't know what else to do.

588
00:33:24,195 --> 00:33:25,282
I understand.

589
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:26,769
All right.

590
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:28,816
Hey, Ms. Saracen.

591
00:33:29,428 --> 00:33:30,674
Coach Taylor!

592
00:33:31,318 --> 00:33:33,005
- How you doing?
- How are you doing?

593
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:35,591
I'm feeling much better
now that I know you're all right.

594
00:33:35,852 --> 00:33:38,086
It's so good to see you.
How's your wife and Gracie?

595
00:33:38,246 --> 00:33:40,544
They're doing just fine.
I'm here to...

596
00:33:41,014 --> 00:33:43,390
I'm here to take y'all home,
if that's all right.

597
00:33:43,794 --> 00:33:46,310
Well, yes it is.
I'm ready to go home.

598
00:33:46,571 --> 00:33:48,820
Gimme a hand here real quick.
Why don't we...

599
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,148
walk with this gentlemen?
I'll be right with you.

600
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:55,064
- I'm Lorraine.
- Nice to meet you.

601
00:33:55,871 --> 00:33:57,921
What the hell are you thinkin'?

602
00:33:58,468 --> 00:33:59,468
I wasn't.

603
00:34:02,632 --> 00:34:05,739
You know you smell like a damn drunk
right now, don't you?

604
00:34:06,731 --> 00:34:07,731
Yeah.

605
00:34:08,056 --> 00:34:08,958
I do.

606
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,476
Thank you.
Come on, Ms. Saracen.

607
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:21,528
- Bye-bye. You keep up the good work.
- Thank you again.

608
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:23,764
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, ma'am.

609
00:34:24,026 --> 00:34:26,016
- Here's your water.
- Sure you don't want me

610
00:34:26,277 --> 00:34:28,560
- to fix you a sandwich?
- No, I don't need a sandwich.

611
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:30,954
No, I've already eaten.
Thank you very much.

612
00:34:31,114 --> 00:34:33,664
- We got a game tomorrow night.
- Yes, ma'am.

613
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:38,544
Sure glad you came by,
'cause I think Matthew needs your help.

614
00:34:40,301 --> 00:34:41,161
Okay.

615
00:34:41,321 --> 00:34:42,842
- All righty.
- Good night.

616
00:34:43,002 --> 00:34:45,152
- Thank you again.
- You're welcome.

617
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,237
I don't need any of your dad coach talk,
so you...

618
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:58,007
feel free to just go home.

619
00:35:02,326 --> 00:35:04,335
Don't touch...
Get away from me!

620
00:35:04,495 --> 00:35:05,902
Get off me!

621
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:09,351
Do you know how many people
depend on you to make good decisions?

622
00:35:10,198 --> 00:35:11,398
Do you have any idea?

623
00:35:11,795 --> 00:35:13,438
Your grandmother,
your teammates!

624
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:15,048
You better start making 'em!

625
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:18,486
You better stop being so damn selfish
and stop feeling sorry for yourself!

626
00:35:18,746 --> 00:35:20,320
Shut up!
You don't care about me!

627
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:22,568
You left me for a better job!

628
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:24,774
Your daughter left me for a better guy!

629
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:26,884
Carlotta left me for Guatemala.

630
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:29,029
My dad left me for a damn war!

631
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,866
Everybody leaves me!

632
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,459
What's wrong with me?

633
00:35:50,874 --> 00:35:52,768
There's nothing wrong with you.

634
00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:59,443
There's nothing wrong with you at all.

635
00:36:27,248 --> 00:36:30,367
<i>Shouldn't you be getting ready
for a football game right now?</i>

636
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:32,517
I'll head over in just a minute.

637
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:36,104
That's... that's a pretty snazzy sweater
you have on there.

638
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,643
You come all the way
over here to tell me that?

639
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,254
I don't know how to say this, but...

640
00:37:01,742 --> 00:37:02,839
Then don't.

641
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:05,008
Will you please just try
and listen to me?

642
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:07,427
Landry, Landry,
I don't wanna listen.

643
00:37:09,649 --> 00:37:11,199
Please don't do this.

644
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:15,372
All right...
This isn't fair to you

645
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:18,064
for me to just ignore this
and pretend like it's not there.

646
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,786
I can't just keep
doing that to you, okay?

647
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,341
You're making a mistake.

648
00:38:21,577 --> 00:38:23,027
I actually gotta go.

649
00:38:24,688 --> 00:38:27,382
There's kind of a spot
with my name on the bench.

650
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,735
I can't Miss that, so...

651
00:38:29,895 --> 00:38:31,768
Then I'll see you after the game.

652
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,633
Come on back.

653
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:11,899
Okay, good, now...
No, you're cutting too soon.

654
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:13,909
Honey, honey...
Honey!

655
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:17,126
Stop! Stop!
Honey, hold on, hold on!

656
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:18,859
Don't cut it yet!
Wait.

657
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:21,437
I got it, okay?
I only missed two on my driving test.

658
00:39:24,307 --> 00:39:25,607
Hey.
How are y'all?

659
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,233
Hey, y'all.

660
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:05,986
Just came by to wish my team luck.

661
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,695
Saracen...

662
00:40:09,696 --> 00:40:12,196
I wanted to stop by
and tell ya to kick some ass tonight.

663
00:40:13,822 --> 00:40:15,905
All you boys gotta do it tonight.

664
00:40:17,356 --> 00:40:20,101
This might end up being
the last place I ever play.

665
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:28,628
Smash.

666
00:40:33,322 --> 00:40:37,005
Coach, I don't care what the board says
or if we forfeit the rest of the season.

667
00:40:37,165 --> 00:40:39,140
Smash is a part of this team.

668
00:40:39,377 --> 00:40:41,309
- That's right, coach.
- Let him play.

669
00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:45,354
He can't play,
and y'all are very well aware of that.

670
00:40:47,223 --> 00:40:50,276
Look, look, I know I can't play...

671
00:40:50,806 --> 00:40:51,806
all right?

672
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:55,156
The best thing
you can do for me is win.

673
00:40:56,051 --> 00:40:58,743
Get to the playoffs. I'll be right back
with y'all doin' my thing.

674
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:01,494
For now, I'll be watching.

675
00:41:02,444 --> 00:41:04,164
But y'all could still do this.

676
00:41:04,426 --> 00:41:07,043
I mean, look, you got Saracen, Riggins,

677
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:10,671
Bradley can barely catch a cold,
much less a football.

678
00:41:12,642 --> 00:41:15,026
Brooks probably
the slowest brother in Texas.

679
00:41:15,968 --> 00:41:18,118
But, look, everybody plays hard.

680
00:41:19,224 --> 00:41:22,162
And no matter what happens out there,
y'all rember this.

681
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:24,293
You the Dillon Panthers, baby.

682
00:41:24,453 --> 00:41:25,935
- That's right.
- That's right!

683
00:41:26,196 --> 00:41:27,562
Y'all are state champs.

684
00:41:34,898 --> 00:41:36,448
Y'all ready for this?
