1
00:00:32,872 --> 00:00:34,779
Why she staring at him like that?

2
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,247
You really want me to tell you why?

3
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:39,367
I could.
You're not gonna want to hear it.

4
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,786
All I'm saying is she's my girlfriend,
all right?

5
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:45,665
She probably shouldn't be staring off
at Swedish people like that.

6
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:47,917
Why don't you go over
and punch him in the face?

7
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:49,627
Is that what you would do?

8
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:51,865
In some situations,
you need to ask yourself

9
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:54,966
WWRD?
What would Riggins do in this situation?

10
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:56,627
He would walk over to him--

11
00:00:56,777 --> 00:00:59,979
Riggins would not be in this situation,
cause Riggins

12
00:01:00,138 --> 00:01:02,265
is captain of the SS Tatas over there.

13
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:04,517
He's probably slept
with literally, like,

14
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:06,204
half of the girls

15
00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:10,731
at Dillon High, not to mention
some of their moms and sisters--

16
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:15,089
Look. That's the guy that's
gonna give me the ball.

17
00:01:15,277 --> 00:01:17,029
Smile, man, it's gonna be a good year.

18
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,699
- Come on, smile.
- What's up, Smash?

19
00:01:19,961 --> 00:01:21,805
All you got to do is hang
on at my coattails.

20
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:25,955
When did he turn into such a tool?

21
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:27,629
This is ridiculous.

22
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:34,589
It's never gonna happen.

23
00:01:34,776 --> 00:01:36,907
Don't be negative.
You don't know what could happen.

24
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:38,514
What if I made team, and--

25
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:40,303
she starts to see me...

26
00:01:41,064 --> 00:01:43,116
- I need to ask you.
- Spark something inside her.

27
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:46,601
Why are you trying out for the team?
Because you're gonna get hurt.

28
00:01:46,863 --> 00:01:49,398
- Don't be cynical.
- Cynical?

29
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:06,204
Hi, honey.
You watch my stuff for me, please?

30
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:09,165
No, no mom.
You need to leave right now.

31
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:12,003
How many times have we talked
about this? Don't come to the pool.

32
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:13,489
We've already been through this.

33
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:16,839
- This is the only place-- Excuse me.
- You can't show up all the time, mom.

34
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:20,426
- Sweetie, I don't show up all the time.
- Can't you go to a different pool ?

35
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:22,854
I miss your father,
you never talk to me anymore,

36
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:25,290
there ain't a room in the house
big enough to contain me.

37
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:26,370
I'm getting in the water.

38
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:27,892
You're just here checking up on me--

39
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:30,121
I am not checking up on you.
That is ridiculous.

40
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,562
- You're just trying to spying on me.
- Honey,

41
00:02:33,665 --> 00:02:35,524
I'm not spying on you at all.

42
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:38,895
I am curious about your life.
I enjoy being in the pool--

43
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:40,853
Am I gonna have to help you
out of the pool?

44
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:43,019
I am curious.
I am curious about "the Swede,"

45
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:45,432
I'm curious about what Matt
thinks about the Swede,

46
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,911
I'm curious about--
You don't--

47
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:48,371
You're embarrassing me.

48
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,488
Honey?

49
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:58,172
I think my water just broke.

50
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,717
Your water can't break, mom.
You have another three weeks.

51
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:04,190
Either I just peed in the pool
or my water's broke.

52
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:13,521
I can't do it.

53
00:03:13,783 --> 00:03:15,690
No, I can't do it anymore.
I'm too tired.

54
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:17,233
Just hang in there, okay?

55
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:19,777
Where the hell's your father?

56
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,045
- Tami Taylor's room?
- Yeah, in 206.

57
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:49,390
Hey, baby, hey baby.

58
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,981
Can I stand here?

59
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:01,472
Oh, honey.

60
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,697
- Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
- How are you, huh?

61
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:10,870
We need just a little bit more, darling.

62
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,250
I'm gonna get you this baby,
but I can't do it alone.

63
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:18,586
I hate you. It's coming.

64
00:04:43,236 --> 00:04:45,123
Welcome to the family.

65
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,975

86
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:22,537
- Get ready.
- Here we come.

87
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,242
Come on, let's go little dancer.

88
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:27,770
Welcome home, baby Grace.

89
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,037
Here's your new home.

90
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:33,545
This is where it's all gonna happen.

91
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:35,514
It's all gonna happen right here.

92
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:37,612
Jules!

93
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:43,022
I had asked jules to clean this up.
Jules!

94
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:46,650
Look who's home. Say hey.

95
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:49,295
She's opening up her eyes.
So she can say, "Hey, big sis."

96
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,733
- Why is her head so pointy?
- That's normal, sweetheart.

97
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:53,597
How come you didn't clean this place up?

98
00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:55,945
Because I didn't have time.
I got to go to work. Sorry.

99
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:59,078
I thought you were taking today off.
It's your sister's first day at home.

100
00:06:59,216 --> 00:07:01,999
I have to go to work, okay?
I love you guys. I'll be home tonight.

101
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:04,448
Say hi to the Swede.

102
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:06,879
Who's the Swede?

103
00:07:07,138 --> 00:07:09,924
Someone she's flirting with at the pool.
I can't believe this mess.

104
00:07:11,216 --> 00:07:12,426
What about the Saracen?

105
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,679
She's dating the Saracen,
and she's flirting with the Swede.

106
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:20,540
Welcome home, sweetheart.

107
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:24,500
I think this whole football thing
is a terrible idea.

108
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:26,106
You've mentioned that a few times.

109
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:28,650
But does my shoulder
look swollen to you?

110
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:31,269
You think your daddy's
gonna love you anymore?

111
00:07:31,457 --> 00:07:32,798
I do actually.

112
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:37,240
- I am burning up.
- Me too.

113
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:39,822
Would you mind doing my back for me?

114
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,166
- Do what?
- My back.

115
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:46,205
Yeah. Of course.

116
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:47,942
Thanks.

117
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:51,644
It's just...
You got to be sure

118
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:53,738
to put on several coats
throughout the day.

119
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:56,053
Got a little bit too much.
Are you ready?

120
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:07,565
Actually, got a--

121
00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:09,846
I got a show on Thursday.
At the Bend.

122
00:08:10,496 --> 00:08:11,735
Oh, the Bend.

123
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:15,781
- That's a cool place.
- You've been to the Bend?

124
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:20,139
- Yeah, a few times.
- Well, you should come by.

125
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,267
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah, what do you mean?

126
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,417
- Okay.
- Yeah, it starts at eleven.

127
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,103
Yeah, I guess,

128
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:30,046
- I guess I'll see yo there, then.
- I guess.

129
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,534
- All right.
- Yeah, don't be late.

130
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:42,837
As you were born the first time
from broken waters,

131
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:44,640
you will be born again today,

132
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:46,478
from the broken waters of baptism

133
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:49,857
and baptism is going to--
Upon the profession of your faith

134
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:51,775
to the word of God, I baptise you

135
00:08:52,037 --> 00:08:53,838
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

136
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:06,067
Ladies!

137
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:09,250
You guys want to make
some memories tonight?

138
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:11,842
I'm thinking like 7:30.

139
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,703
Where's my flier, Garrity?

140
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,970
No one would be happier
to save your soul than me, Tim.

141
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:26,001
Christ Teen Messengers.

142
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,689
What was that, like a cult or something?

143
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:35,472
It's young Christians coming together
to worship and spread the word of Jesus.

144
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:38,197
You look good. Like, real good.

145
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,187
It's probably because
yesterday I was baptized

146
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:43,118
and accepted Jesus
as my lord and savior.

147
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,954
What did you do recently?

148
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,123
I had a three-way with
the Stratton sisters.

149
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,320
I wouldn't go around town bragging about

150
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:52,670
how you spent your entire summer
in a drunken stupor.

151
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:54,539
So what you're saying is you're jealous.

152
00:09:56,237 --> 00:09:58,640
Yeah, Tim. I'm jealous.

153
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,222
Just so you know...

154
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:07,366
You're still number one.

155
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:09,554
You're still the best I've ever had.

156
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:16,813
- It's true.
- Don't talk to me like that.

157
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:20,512
Good-bye.

158
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,220
- Enjoy Jesus.
- Enjoy your depraved hedonism.

159
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,245
- Oh, I will.
- So will I.

160
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:29,544
- I mean Jesus, not Hedonism.
- Of course.

161
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,792
Jerk.

162
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:33,931
Well, I don't care what the man said,

163
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,950
I'm not gonna take off your uniform.

164
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,340
It's really not that big of a deal,
grandma.

165
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:42,081
So we don't need any...
any of that meat stuff.

166
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:46,348
Oh, my Lord.

167
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:50,853
How are you doing?
How are you?

168
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:53,397
Coach Eric Taylor.

169
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,732
How are you, son?

170
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:56,552
Miss you.

171
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:00,638
How you doin'?

172
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,435
How come you didn't come to see Gracie?

173
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:05,117
Because I had two two-a-days, so..

174
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:08,909
- Julie's been telling about it.
- How are you and Julie doing?

175
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:12,200
Good. Why?
I mean, did she say

176
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,917
anything to you?

177
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:16,866
She supposed to say something?
Something I'm supposed to know?

178
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:18,876
- No, I just didn't know--
- Come see the kid.

179
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:20,090
I was gonna come and see,

180
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:23,403
you know, a lot of football,
and she's been lifeguarding, so...

181
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,314
I didn't wanna just stop by.

182
00:11:27,056 --> 00:11:28,286
- All right.
- All right.

183
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:37,608
Don't just stand by and watch it happen.

184
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:41,537
You know what I'm saying?

185
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:43,363
Yeah.

186
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:46,133
I do. Thanks, coach.

187
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:48,734
Take care.

188
00:11:52,238 --> 00:11:53,261
Hey, Carl.

189
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:00,482
This-- this Friday?

190
00:12:02,144 --> 00:12:05,109
Well, I got football practice,
then I might go work out...

191
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:07,127
After that. I'm serious.

192
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,785
Well, call me if you want to see
a movie or something, okay?

193
00:12:36,136 --> 00:12:38,460
What happened?
Who was that?

194
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:42,692
I- I think that was him.

195
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:44,608
Was who?

196
00:12:46,184 --> 00:12:47,427
The guy who attacked me.

197
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:00,900
- Come here.
- I'm going to bed.

198
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:02,442
I've been at Lois.

199
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:04,778
Come here, I want to talk to you.

200
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:09,992
I just want to go to bed, okay?
I have work in the morning.

201
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:20,377
How are you doing?

202
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:22,880
Good.

203
00:13:25,729 --> 00:13:27,212
How are you and Matt doing?

204
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:29,654
Fine.

205
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,212
Good.

206
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:37,436
Who is this Swedish guy?

207
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:44,791
And what does this have to do with you?

208
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:50,284
What does this have to do with me?

209
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:54,703
I'm your father, that's what
it has to do with me.

210
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:00,370
So you decide to come back
after eight months in Austin

211
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:03,225
and have these deep long conversations?

212
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:06,882
You are so hypocritical.

213
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,324
I'm done. I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

214
00:14:13,742 --> 00:14:14,897
Come here.

215
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:17,017
Come here, come here!

216
00:14:20,782 --> 00:14:21,857
Six!

217
00:14:22,242 --> 00:14:23,247
Blue eight!

218
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:24,674
Hut!

219
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:26,860
Outside!

220
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,284
Riggins, you gotta cut it.

221
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,115
Come on, Riggins.
Come on.

222
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:39,206
- What's Buddy doing here?
- Watching practice.

223
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:41,416
I run closed practes.

224
00:14:41,872 --> 00:14:43,318
Send him home.

225
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,487
- How are you?
- Hot enough for you?

226
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,219
I've sweat runnin'
off my sweat, bro.

227
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:55,472
This is awkward, but I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

228
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:02,854
It's not pop warner. Keep your head up
like a man and stick him.

229
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:06,264
If he wants me to leave, then he needs
to come over here and tell me himself.

230
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,485
Cut him down. Do it again.

231
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:09,861
Come on, Riggins.

232
00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:11,321
Black nine!

233
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,238
Who does-- who does he think pays

234
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:16,076
- his bloody damn salary.
- Would you tell him later?

235
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:18,619
Come on, let's go.

236
00:15:23,284 --> 00:15:24,289
You know what?

237
00:15:24,763 --> 00:15:27,885
You are disgusting.
You are miserable, miserable!

238
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:31,545
A miserable, god dang

239
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:33,969
football player. You have no potential.

240
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:35,846
You're just walking through this..

241
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:38,390
What did you say to me?
Guys like you, okay?

242
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,729
- With no heart--
- Oh, I got no heart?

243
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:43,114
Here. This helmet...

244
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:45,647
For your new full back,
good luck opening day.

245
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,443
Riggins!

246
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:49,776
You do not walk away from me, number 33!

247
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:40,582
The point is...

248
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:42,997
Is that she--

249
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,956
she told me to lotion her up.

250
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:47,029
Maybe she just didn't want
to get sunburn.

251
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,419
All I'm saying is
I was literally inches away

252
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:52,117
from, you know, copping a feel.

253
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:53,985
It's a good picture of him, though.

254
00:16:54,728 --> 00:16:58,345
It's a great picture of the Smash.
He really looks like a captain.

255
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:04,372
I'm gonna go get some cheetos.

256
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:08,563
What's going on?
What you doin'?

257
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:12,417
Nothin'.
Just-- just hanging.

258
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:23,671
There's this party
at lake Orio Thursday.

259
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:26,792
I was kind of hoping
maybe you'd come, please.

260
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:32,212
I was just gonna stay at home,
and take it easy, read a book.

261
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:35,364
The whole team is gonna be there.

262
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:38,991
And everyone that's got a girlfriend,
their girlfriend's gonna be there.

263
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,162
And since you're kind
of my girlfriend I was

264
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,348
kind of hoping you'd be there.

265
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:49,696
Look, it's just, you mean a lot to me,
and I don't want to just...

266
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:51,142
Lose you.

267
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,821
It sounds great.

268
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:00,797
I'll try to make it.

269
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:02,646
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

270
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:04,731
- Thursday.
- Okay.

271
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:10,829
- You're gonna love this.
- That's it.

272
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:12,466
It's tofu-- come on, one more.

273
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:15,172
Tofu and porcini mushroom,
it's got some onions in there,

274
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:16,924
- some brown rice.
- I'm good.

275
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:18,717
Got some beans there, we all set?

276
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:20,844
- There you go.
- Looks delish!

277
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:24,014
- Enjoy.
- Aren't we forgetting sothing?

278
00:18:25,152 --> 00:18:26,532
No, no.

279
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:29,296
Of course.

280
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:35,012
Thank you, Lord, for this food
that we are about to receive

281
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:36,623
and for your wisdom, Lord.

282
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:39,234
I pray that you will guide me
and everyone at this table

283
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,637
to help respect you,
and make good choices.

284
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,104
For exemple, to not take
advantage of the vulnerability

285
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:47,611
of a recently separated,
but not yet divorced woman.

286
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:52,899
And in turn, to give others
at the table the strength to remember

287
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,866
that a mother of three should not
be wearing skinny jeans.

288
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:57,312
Amen.

289
00:18:58,627 --> 00:18:59,633
Bon appetit.

290
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:02,386
- Enjoy.
- Looks good.

291
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:10,268
Please, sleep.

292
00:19:10,968 --> 00:19:12,273
Little girl.

293
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:15,265
- Is she down good?
- Could you make some cookies?

294
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:17,108
Thank you.

295
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:25,984
You're nice to me.

296
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:32,958
Carl called.

297
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:38,623
They need me to come back Friday.

298
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,133
Which Friday?

299
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:44,784
This Friday?

300
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:48,431
I thought you had two weeks.

301
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:56,340
Bottom line, they need me back.
It's not my decision,

302
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:58,912
*
he passed the buck up on his top.*

303
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,630
And uh...

304
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:05,636
We've been through this before,
we just have to deal with it.

305
00:20:05,786 --> 00:20:07,768
You know the drill, what happens.

306
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:26,448
You know, I don't have a choice.

307
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:32,139
The fact of the matter is,
I don't have a choice.

308
00:20:40,018 --> 00:20:41,220
I mean, it's--

309
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,464
You know it's what I do.
I can't go, and I can't,

310
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:47,365
I can't do this thing half-assed.

311
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:49,503
I do it half-assed,
it doesn't help anyone.

312
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,325
And I can't.

313
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,513
No, I can't.

314
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:05,998
You know?

315
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,724
I really need you to talk.

316
00:21:22,668 --> 00:21:23,841
That's it?

317
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:48,051
I'll be back in a little while, okay?

318
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:13,145
<i>Dog thinks he is the boss.
He's not the boss. You are the boss.</i>

319
00:22:13,322 --> 00:22:15,495
<i>You must be dominate him.</i>

320
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,818
*

321
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:28,516
- Look what the cat *agged in.
- Unlock the door!

322
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,516
You heard that...

323
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:34,764
Tennessee Hillbilly stonewalled me.

324
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:37,882
He won't even talk to me.
Locked me out of practice.

325
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:41,022
Told mike mcGill that I was...

326
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:43,606
an annoying nuisance.

327
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,031
Can you imagine that?

328
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,858
That is hard to...

329
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,803
There is nothing I love more
than Dillon Panthers,

330
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,072
I always have and you know
that I'm trying to help.

331
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,751
That's all I'm trying to do.
That's all I've ever cared about.

332
00:23:04,062 --> 00:23:05,667
How long have you been sleeping here?

333
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:07,046
I don't sleep here much.

334
00:23:07,491 --> 00:23:09,048
I work late sometimes.

335
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,560
It's comfortable, you know,
the neon lights.

336
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,264
- Congratulations on the baby.
- Thank you.

337
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:19,428
Can I speak to you for a minute?

338
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:21,433
- Out here.
- Yeah.

339
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,969
I'll be righback.

340
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,050
What were you doing
at soccer practice tonight?

341
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,928
- What you're talking about.
- I saw you there, buddy.

342
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:32,862
I do not understand

343
00:23:32,956 --> 00:23:35,450
how a smart, beautiful,
intelligent woman

344
00:23:35,712 --> 00:23:38,238
could fall

345
00:23:38,802 --> 00:23:40,580
for a little tree-hugger who makes

346
00:23:40,842 --> 00:23:42,764
seven dollars an hour
at health food store.

347
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:45,418
He owns that store first of all,

348
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,330
were you at my meditation group
the other night too?

349
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:50,653
I have a right to protect my children,

350
00:23:50,747 --> 00:23:52,653
if I think their mother is becoming

351
00:23:52,738 --> 00:23:54,603
a part of some kind
of cult or something.

352
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:56,635
You know what,

353
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,431
- do whatever!
- Don't go to soccer

354
00:23:58,693 --> 00:24:00,609
- practice again.
- Do whatever you want.

355
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,936
But he is not gonna turn
my children into communists,

356
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:04,928
with all these hippie ideas.

357
00:24:05,603 --> 00:24:06,606
Is it-- He here?

358
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:08,149
That's him? You here?

359
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:11,178
You brought him here?
He's in my-- You get out of my truck!

360
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,593
Open the damn door.

361
00:24:13,842 --> 00:24:15,573
Get out.
Unlock that door.

362
00:24:15,938 --> 00:24:18,284
- You come out of there.
- You gotta calm down!

363
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:21,246
Unlock that door.

364
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:33,072
Get in the car.
Don't make me--

365
00:24:33,323 --> 00:24:34,625
Stop, stop.

366
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:40,848
It's all right.

367
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:45,944
Come on, Riggins.

368
00:24:53,176 --> 00:24:55,984
- What you gonna have for dinner?
- I think I'm gonna have a salad.

369
00:24:56,134 --> 00:24:58,134
- I got some chicken.
- I got to get in shape.

370
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,322
I'm gonna learn how to surf.

371
00:25:00,735 --> 00:25:03,674
- That'd be good.
- If not now, when?

372
00:25:04,483 --> 00:25:05,497
Come on.

373
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:08,791
Pick it up, Riggins!
Come on!

374
00:25:18,281 --> 00:25:19,831
I think he's had enough, coach.

375
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:21,097
He owes me five more.

376
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:25,059
- Come on, Riggins.
- Five more, son.

377
00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:36,088
All right, Riggins, you're done.

378
00:25:38,144 --> 00:25:40,044
First off, I would like to say that...

379
00:25:40,764 --> 00:25:42,360
This is your team.

380
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:44,925
And 100 percent I am in support

381
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:47,540
of you, and the decisions you make,

382
00:25:47,802 --> 00:25:49,132
and the leadership of the team.

383
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:50,728
Go on.

384
00:25:51,874 --> 00:25:53,461
I know Tim Riggins really well.

385
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:58,007
Both on and off the field.
He's one of my closest friends.

386
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,599
Leaning on him like that isn't
gonna get you any results, sir.

387
00:26:09,421 --> 00:26:10,486
Well...

388
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,989
You got a decision to make, Jason.

389
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:18,193
You can come to the games
Friday nights, and be some kind of...

390
00:26:19,451 --> 00:26:20,657
town symbol

391
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:22,118
some kind of mascot.

392
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:25,536
Or you can come to Friday night games,
and you can be

393
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:27,544
a football coach.

394
00:26:28,737 --> 00:26:30,183
But you can't be both.

395
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,037
They can't be your friends.

396
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,100
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

397
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:49,197
I want you home
by eleven o'clock, all right?

398
00:26:49,347 --> 00:26:50,793
Mom said eleven thirty.

399
00:26:50,934 --> 00:26:53,545
I don't care what she said.
I want you home by eleven o'clock.

400
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,498
Your absentee father says
eleven o'clock,

401
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:58,806
but of course if you'd like to make it
ten thirty, we can make that happen too.

402
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,118
- Whatever.
- And if Lois

403
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:03,032
should even look at any alcohol
this evening, I want you

404
00:27:03,294 --> 00:27:04,994
to give me a call, you understand?

405
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:06,909
Where are your shoes?

406
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:09,522
I'm not wearing shoes, dad.

407
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:47,516
Ty. Are you okay?

408
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,272
- What took you so long?
- I came just as soon you call...

409
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,633
- Where do you hear the noises from?
- Out here.

410
00:27:55,763 --> 00:27:58,421
- Be careful.
- You stay here, okay.

411
00:27:58,683 --> 00:27:59,919
I'm gonna check the perimeter.

412
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:02,097
- Near the tree.
- Make sure everything's okay.

413
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:03,759
I'm sure it's nothing.

414
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:07,676
All right, your knight
in shining armor has arrived.

415
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:30,719
Tyra, it's a skunk.

416
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:33,289
Tyra, that's a skunk.

417
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,962
- Let me in in the front.
- A skunk?

418
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:39,793
I just don't want to get sprayed.
It's fine. There's none back here.

419
00:28:53,936 --> 00:28:56,164
I've to go home.
My mom gonna beat the hell out of me.

420
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:57,892
We should've gone to the party.

421
00:28:58,164 --> 00:28:59,190
It's okay. You can go.

422
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,734
- What?
- No, it's okay. I'll find a ride.

423
00:29:01,996 --> 00:29:03,732
I'm not just going to leave you here.

424
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,167
I swear. It's fine, Lois.

425
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:12,745
Call me later, okay?

426
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,676
Man, I'm in Tyra Collette's
bathroom right now.

427
00:30:08,826 --> 00:30:10,512
<i>Why are you calling me from</i>

428
00:30:10,773 --> 00:30:13,126
- the bathroom?
- You gotta try to keep up me here,

429
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:14,995
cause I've got like 45 seconds

430
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:18,103
and I really need to get
your advice on something.

431
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:20,602
I'm on Tyra's couch.
We're watching Fried Green Tomatoes.

432
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:24,208
Everything's going great.
And I need to figure out

433
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:25,526
how to get my arm around her.

434
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:28,070
No, no. Look,
does she want you to touch her?

435
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:31,694
I'm not calling you for relationship
advice, I'm calling you

436
00:30:31,947 --> 00:30:34,535
to find just some technique.

437
00:30:34,797 --> 00:30:37,331
<i>Just sit down close to her
and try, I don't know,</i>

438
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,157
rub your arm against hers.

439
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:41,262
If she doesn't hit you
or doesn't seem weird

440
00:30:41,493 --> 00:30:43,097
then try to put your arm around her.

441
00:30:43,247 --> 00:30:45,670
All right.
Me, once I get my arm around her,

442
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:47,521
things will just kind
of fall into place,

443
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:49,884
this has been like a long time coming.

444
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:52,970
Anyways, I got to go.
How you doing at the party?

445
00:30:53,232 --> 00:30:56,515
- It kinda sucks. Julie never showed up.
- <i>That sounds great, man.</i>

446
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:59,894
I'll call you later and let you
know how this goes.

447
00:31:37,783 --> 00:31:40,046
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Are you hungry?

448
00:31:41,361 --> 00:31:42,440
Are you hungry?

449
00:31:42,938 --> 00:31:46,148
- Yeah. I'm hungry.
- Let's go get some food.

450
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:54,865
Well, yeah. Come again.

451
00:31:55,127 --> 00:31:56,140
It's good to see you.

452
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:04,320
What's up? You came.

453
00:32:04,451 --> 00:32:05,634
Did you like it?

454
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:07,795
It was totally amazing.

455
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:09,908
I was pretty nervous.
I don't know.

456
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,688
No, you guys looked awesome up there.

457
00:32:13,384 --> 00:32:16,511
Well, come-- Just come again.
Just don't say enything else.

458
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:20,550
No, I mean, it was emotional
and heartbreaking.

459
00:32:20,778 --> 00:32:22,577
I'm adamant.
You gotta come again.

460
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,287
Babe. I gotta go.

461
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:30,105
Julie, this is Meg.
Meg, Julie.

462
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,446
Julie. Your friend from the pool.

463
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:36,532
Your high school bud. It nice
to meet you. Antoine loves you.

464
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,897
We have this party. And if I don't
show up, my sister is going to kill me.

465
00:32:43,977 --> 00:32:46,542
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

466
00:32:50,816 --> 00:32:52,384
I'm really happy you came.

467
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:18,908
You gotta be kidding me.

468
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,951
Can we just go?

469
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,716
Can we go?

470
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:26,457
Yeah.
No, no, we can't go.

471
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:29,065
We can go as soon as you tell me
what the hell you' doing

472
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,837
at a place like this at 12:30 at night,
and then we can go.

473
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:33,892
I know I'm grounded and everything.

474
00:33:34,143 --> 00:33:36,130
Can you just really
not yell at me right now?

475
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:38,542
Can I tell you something?

476
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:40,674
I'm leaving early.

477
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:43,182
I have to leave tomorrow night,
all right?

478
00:33:45,683 --> 00:33:47,492
I'm not gonna be back maybe
for a few weeks.

479
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:49,896
So you being my daughter,
I'd sort of like

480
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,839
to know what the hell is going on.

481
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,706
I came here to chasing some boy.

482
00:34:00,716 --> 00:34:05,857
And got completely humiliated
because guess what, he has a girlfriend.

483
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:08,749
I misread every stupid signal.

484
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,330
What's going on with you and Matt,
what's wrong with that?

485
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:27,417
There is nothing wrong,
that's the point, okay?

486
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:31,689
Matt's perfect, right?
And we're the hit couple.

487
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,818
But I just-- I see him turning into you

488
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,195
and-- and me turning into my mom.

489
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,101
And that just terrified
the crap out of me.

490
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:48,952
And. I'm 16.
There is just--

491
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:52,895
There has to be more than this.

492
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:01,271
And I just...

493
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,724
I feel so guilty for feeling like this.

494
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:16,329
Listen to me.

495
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:23,944
You can leave Matt.

496
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:26,869
No one is gonna love you any less.

497
00:35:27,514 --> 00:35:28,857
You realize that, don't you?

498
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:34,913
You got that?

499
00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:43,040
The other guy sounds to me, like,

500
00:35:43,537 --> 00:35:45,021
you know, he's...

501
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:47,849
he's some other guy.

502
00:35:49,323 --> 00:35:50,891
He's just some other guy.

503
00:35:54,606 --> 00:35:55,827
Hell with him.

504
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:02,029
You're all right.

505
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:03,932
It's all good.

506
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,287
We really miss having you around.

507
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:17,387
OK, so we got Kit Kats, Nachos.

508
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:19,190
- Okay.
- You get the Pringles.

509
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:22,429
Kit Kats, Nachos, Pringles. Is that it?

510
00:36:23,256 --> 00:36:24,465
yes, and you are on your own,

511
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,763
because I forgot that the
Collette account has a little overdue.

512
00:36:30,007 --> 00:36:32,907
- Pringles, Nachos--
- And don't forget the Ding Dongs.

513
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:35,766
Are you gonna eat all them?
I'm not gonna help you out.

514
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:37,815
'Cause I'm tryin' to cut down.

515
00:36:38,123 --> 00:36:39,233
You know I'll eat all at.

516
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:40,985
Okay, that's true.

517
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,200
My knight in shining armor.

518
00:36:44,225 --> 00:36:45,531
I'm gonna go get some Pringles.

519
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:47,239
Alright, good luck.

520
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:04,073
How was the movie?

521
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:08,993
If I was on leave, that 'cause of you.*

522
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:11,067
I ain't telling what I would have done.

523
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:15,236
What the hell are you doing here?

524
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,304
Why are you hanging out with a loser?

525
00:37:18,543 --> 00:37:19,606
We could have us some fun.

526
00:37:22,955 --> 00:37:24,201
Don't touch me.

527
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:26,447
You get away from me!

528
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:28,032
Get away from me!

529
00:37:34,881 --> 00:37:35,907
Get off her!

530
00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:42,164
I'm gonna be back for you.

531
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:11,033
Oh my God.

532
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:31,762
What are we supposed to do now?
We gotta go to the hospital.

533
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:36,420
Tyra, what did I do?

534
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:45,409
He's not--
Tyra, where the hospital?

535
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:47,259
The hospital's close, I swear.

536
00:38:50,107 --> 00:38:51,487
He stopped breathing, Tyra.

537
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,252
He's dead.

538
00:39:03,203 --> 00:39:04,211
I killed him.

539
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:09,800
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna call my dad. He's a cop.

540
00:39:10,062 --> 00:39:12,418
- He'll know how--
- No, just stop it.

541
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,678
Tyra, we're not-- We can't--

542
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,680
I mean, we can't.

543
00:39:56,942 --> 00:39:58,337
What else are we gonna do?

544
00:41:37,648 --> 00:41:40,158
<i>Presenting the 2006 championship ring</i>

545
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,160
<i>to Bradley Colby, Greg Rawlins.</i>

546
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:24,447
