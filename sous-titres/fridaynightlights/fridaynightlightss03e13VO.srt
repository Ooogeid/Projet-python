1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,251
I don't want to hold him back.
I can't stand the thought of losing him.

2
00:00:03,556 --> 00:00:04,918
I know. Me neither.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,337
I spent all this time
trying to go to college.

4
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,132
It's seeming
more and more impossible.

5
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,468
You are gonna have everything
you are dreaming of.

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,720
The Vanderbilt thing
not working out was fate.

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,556
I'm going to San Antonio with Tim.

8
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:19,017
- You liked calling the cops on my dad.
- That's not true.

9
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:22,061
- Katie, I had no choice.
- I want nothing to do with you.

10
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:25,647
Redistricting, try to open up East
Dillon High... It's never gonna happen.

11
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:28,541
No one is gonna stand by
and let the Dillon Panthers

12
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,944
get dismantled
because of some dang politics!

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,169


14
00:01:55,846 --> 00:01:58,574
And Panther wide receiver
and quarterback

15
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:00,243
Matt Saracen

16
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:04,122
will be going to the prestigious
Art Institute of Chicago

17
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:05,385
next year.

18
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,769
And Panther tailback Tim Riggins

19
00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:14,716
will be going to
San Antonio State University.

20
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,493
Congratulations, Tim.

21
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:18,463
We're all so proud of you.

22
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:23,337
And Lyla Garrity,
number two in her class,

23
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:26,810
will be attending...

24
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,398
San Antonio State University
next year.

25
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,758
That's great, Lyla.

26
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,861
And Tyra Collette, who's done
such a great job this year

27
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:39,973
as student council president...
let's give her a big hand for that!

28
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,538
And she is still in the process
of making a decision

29
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,343
between some real exciting
possibilities for next year.

30
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,337
She's been wait-listed at UT!
She's gonna get in.

31
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,588
- Mama, seriously... Stop.
- She's gonna get in!

32
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:56,815
Very exciting, very exciting.

33
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,544
Congratulations on
all your great, hard work...

34
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,805
All right, here we go, listen up!
You are now officially released

35
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:05,852
until August 1st.
What do you say?

36
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:09,965
Final note.

37
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:11,606
J.D.!

38
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:15,484
I want everyone to know that J.D.
has been named...

39
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:18,904
Dave Campbell's High School Quarterback
of the Year. Let's give him a hand.

40
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,445
J.D., why don't you break 'em down?
Let's go. Y'all have a good summer, now.

41
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,854
Bring it in!

42
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:30,708
One now... 2, 3!

43
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,627
- Panther pride!
- J.D.!

44
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:36,351
Way to go, 12!

45
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,010
Way to go!

46
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:42,762
You know that Coach Taylor's contract
is up for discussion

47
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,015
- at the board meeting this Saturday.
- Yes, I do.

48
00:03:46,553 --> 00:03:49,185
And I want to give you the option
to recuse yourself.

49
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:53,855
- Why would I want to do that?
- Well, Tami, he is your husband.

50
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:55,440
Yeah, he is, and...

51
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,692
These contract negotiations
can get heated.

52
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:02,241
It might be difficult to stay objective
under the current circumstances.

53
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,535
I actually have a lot of confidence
in my ability to stay objective,

54
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,918
and professional, and...

55
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:10,875
and do my job as principal, so...

56
00:04:11,494 --> 00:04:12,494
OK.

57
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:16,045
Hey, Paul.
Is there...

58
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:20,306
Is there a question about
Eric's contract for next year?

59
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:23,887
Like I said, Tami,
these matters are complicated.

60
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:26,943
Right, well...

61
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:31,436
The Aveo 5 is a beautiful car.

62
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,523
Besides that, you got side airbags,
and that's the whole reason I want...

63
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:37,311
Look, enough about the damn car,
would you please!

64
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:39,569
- What the hell am I doing?
- You know what we're doing.

65
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,620
Yeah. It's recruitment,
everybody does it, I understand.

66
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:44,240
It is not recruitment.

67
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,577
If it were recruitment,
it would be illegal.

68
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:49,730
- Whatever you wanna call it, all right.
- It's simply a visit.

69
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:51,706
I want you to meet the parents.

70
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:55,300
We got to get there before Smith, from
Arnett Mead. That's the whole point.

71
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:58,255
Great. When we get there, you can
do the talking, that's what you do best.

72
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:01,841
- He may offer him something, we're not.
- It's this right, right up here.

73
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,887
So I don't have to tell y'all about the
tradition of Dillon Panther football.

74
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:08,139
I mean, you see what Smash Williams
is doing this year over at A&M.

75
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:11,543
And he's just the last player
that we've had go into college.

76
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:13,562
And so many players
have gone into the pros.

77
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:15,939
So Shane going to Dillon
means that he's gonna

78
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:18,112
- probably be with the best coach...
- Mr. Garrity!

79
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:21,668
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but...
I might as well just tell you.

80
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,224
We've already made our decision.

81
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:28,076
Shane's gonna go to Dillon High.
Right, son?

82
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,418
Yes, sir.

83
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:31,621
Well, that's...
That's excellent.

84
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,940
Congratulations.

85
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:36,169
- That's a good decision.
- I just have one question, though.

86
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:40,713
Who's the head coach?
Well, Eric's the head coach.

87
00:05:41,197 --> 00:05:42,383
It's not Wade Aikmen?

88
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:47,011
No, sir. Wade Aikmen's been
helping us out with our offense,

89
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:48,870
but no...
Eric's the head coach.

90
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:51,532
When they come by last week,
I sure got the impression that...

91
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:52,759
Who came by?

92
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:54,551
Wade Aikmen.

93
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:57,042
Him and that other fellow,
what was his name?

94
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,002
- McCoy.
- Yeah, McCoy.

95
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,652
They sure made it sound like
they were the ones making the decisions.

96
00:06:10,497 --> 00:06:13,621
3x13: TOMORROW BLUES
(Season Finale)

97
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,669
Subtitles: Team Panthers

98
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,089
With the participation of:

99
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:25,925
benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, GillesSilb,
Ju, Lemonhead, ouazo, tactactac, TVnut

100
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,317
Eat that one.

101
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:01,819
I think I know why they want you
to recuse yourself.

102
00:07:01,944 --> 00:07:04,930
I think it's a negotiating thing,
you know?

103
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:07,677
They're trying to get you
to take less money, or something.

104
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:09,289
A scare tactic.

105
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:13,097
Joe McCoy, Wade Aikmen,
over at the Dubuque house...

106
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:15,309
acting like
they're running the team?

107
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:18,270
Joe McCoy's trying to get me fired.

108
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,399
I don't think so.

109
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:24,614
I mean, that's, that's pretty low.

110
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:28,738
They're mad at us, but I can't believe
that they would do that.

111
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:31,332
I know, baby.
Eat those, eat those!

112
00:07:31,457 --> 00:07:32,459
I can.

113
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:37,873
- Lorraine, you need all these dresses?
- Yes, ma'am, we do.

114
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:41,793
Please, just put them in that suitcase.
I got 'em all out for that reason.

115
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:45,171
Grandma! It's only 15 minutes away.
You don't need to bring everything.

116
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:48,549
Well, I need my dresses, though.
If you were a woman, you'd understand.

117
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,209
I understand you need your clothes,
you just don't need all of 'em.

118
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:53,597
Right, Julie? You understand.
I need my clothes.

119
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:56,058
- She needs her clothes. Yes, ma'am.
- Thanks, Julie.

120
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:59,179
Maybe just leave some here, you know,
for when you come back.

121
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:01,847
What about the magazines from the 70s?
Can we just pitch them?

122
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:03,273
No, I'm not through.

123
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,673
There's a recipe in there,
in one of those.

124
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:08,027
I still need them.
If you'd just put them in that box,

125
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:11,181
- that'd be great. Do you remember this?
- Oh, my gosh!

126
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,451
- Shelby, did you see this?
- What?

127
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:16,995
- Just leave it in the box.
- Look at how cute it is.

128
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,281
Oh, my God.

129
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,624
- Look at your hair!
- OK, 7th grade was a bad year.

130
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,598
No, it's cute.

131
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:26,963
Well, I want this picture, and
that's why I packed it, I'm taking it.

132
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,549
Look, Grandma, either way,


133
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,239
you can take the picture,
but you don't have to take everything.

134
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:34,178
That's right, I don't. But I darn sure
am gonna take this picture!

135
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:37,808
Let's suppose you're at college, I wake
up one morning, I have one my spells,

136
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,754
and I can't...

137
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:42,896
can't remember you...
You know what I'm gonna do?

138
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:44,731
I'm gonna look right up on my wall,

139
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:47,442
and there you're gonna be,
with that smile...

140
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:50,253
that precious, precious boy.

141
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:53,241
That's my concern.

142
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,867
- Just... go in?
- I know, I see... I see your point.

143
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:58,537
Well, I do see your point.
Now I do... Hey!

144
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:01,080
- Thanks for coming. Come on in.
- Hey, baby.

145
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:03,320
What's going on?

146
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:05,369
Well...

147
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:06,516
Go ahead.

148
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:09,672
We just wanted to talk to you
about going to San Antonio State.

149
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:11,058
What about it?

150
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,846
Well, I think your dad has some concerns
about the quality of the school,

151
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:19,600
for you, and I frankly agree
that it may not be the best fit.

152
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,614
I'm already going.
I mean...

153
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:24,646
I was already there,
I paid the tuition, and I'm enrolled.

154
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:27,732
- It's done.
- Yeah, but honey, it's a party school.

155
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:30,861
It's not a party school, Dad.
It's a good school.

156
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,084
It's a crap-ass party school,
and Tim Riggins is going there,

157
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:36,699
- and that's the reason you're going.
- You know what, Dad?

158
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,577
Maybe you shouldn't have blown my
college fund on tearing up a strip club!

159
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:42,131
- Listen, honey. I...
- You see what I'm up against.

160
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:44,462
If you'll excuse me, please.

161
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:47,293
I do not mean to interfere in any way,
but I did want you to know

162
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:50,088
that at your dad's request,
I called Vanderbilt.

163
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:54,468
They actually are willing
to extend the decision until Monday.

164
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:58,387
If you choose to go,
they would like to have you.

165
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:01,699
How're we gonna pay for it?

166
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:04,267
Well...

167
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:07,772
I thought maybe
we could call your uncle Gary.

168
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:11,150
- He hates you.
- Well,

169
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:13,871
I'm not really
fond of him either, but...

170
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:17,129
I'm the one who did this to you,
and I feel like I...

171
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:20,326
I'll do anything, honey, for you
to be able to go to Vanderbilt.

172
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:21,786
Even call Uncle Gary, so...

173
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:23,740
It's a big decision.

174
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,183
It's an important decision.

175
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:29,393
And I think Tim will understand.

176
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:42,848
How you doing?
What's up?

177
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:55,630
- Doing OK?
- Ginnie Warwick! She got into Brown.

178
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:58,743
- I know that.
- She came to celebrate with her family

179
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:02,660
and I got to serve her. Which is
pretty much the metaphor for my future.

180
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:08,208
Oh, and, you know, Vickie Savo?
She's going to Rice.

181
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:10,918
So... that's awesome.

182
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:13,718
What, now, you are going to UT.

183
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,912
- You sound like my mother.
- You are.

184
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:18,782
Well, no, I'm on the wait list, OK?

185
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:22,789
And there's nothing you can do when
you're on the wait list, except wait!

186
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:27,455
- Why don't you just go to UT, then?
- UT?

187
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:29,729
Yeah, why don't you find
the admissions officer

188
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,774
who sent the letter,
and just talk to him directly?

189
00:11:33,258 --> 00:11:36,448
It's a lot better than just sitting
around here and beating on my car.

190
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:38,613
Well, it's a bit desperate.

191
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:40,133
You are desperate.

192
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,477
What can I do for you, Eric?

193
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:56,505
Buddy Garrity and I went over
to Shane Dubuque's yesterday.

194
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,688
That kid's an animal.

195
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:00,991
- Like a water?
- No.

196
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:05,024
As I understand it,
you and Wade were over there last week.

197
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:06,672
Yeah, that's right.

198
00:12:07,906 --> 00:12:11,224
You might be able to imagine
how that makes me feel.

199
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:14,437
Hey, if we lost Shane Dubuque
to Arnett Mead, we'd be dead next year.

200
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:16,362
So I figure, we need him,
let's go get him.

201
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:19,821
Hey, Joe, I don't want you and Wade
running around making house calls,

202
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,709
acting like you represent this team.

203
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:25,202
I didn't see you moving aggressively
on him, and I did not wanna miss

204
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,126
- that opportunity.
- Joe, you do not represent this team.

205
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:31,451
I backed up a truckload of cash
for this team, this year.

206
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,293
Without my son, there is no team.

207
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,953
So as far as I'm concerned,
I represent this team

208
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:38,882
- as much as anybody else in this town.
- You trying to replace me?

209
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:47,391
If you would like to continue,

210
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:50,727
I need your guarantee that,
barring injury, of course,

211
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:54,021
my son starts
every game next season.

212
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:56,456
I also need your guarantee

213
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:59,236
- that Wade Aikmen calls all the plays.
- Mac calls my plays.

214
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:00,765
Yeah, I know.

215
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:04,658
Joe, I don't give a damn
how much money you got,

216
00:13:05,846 --> 00:13:08,954
and I don't care how well you think
that boy of yours can throw a football.

217
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,451
But you're not just messing
with my livelihood now,

218
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:15,564
- you are threatening my family.
- I'm not threatening anybody.

219
00:13:15,992 --> 00:13:17,532
Against my better judgment,

220
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:20,716
I'm offering you an opportunity
to continue with this team.

221
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:26,930
I'm sure you know what you can do
with that opportunity.

222
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:43,255
- I'm pushing down on the broom!
- You're not pushing hard enough.

223
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,973
I'm putting pressure on the broom.


224
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:47,325
You push so fast,
it won't pick up the dirt!

225
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:50,813
Hi, guys.

226
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:54,045
- So, what do you think?
- I think it's amazing.

227
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,840
- Really?
- It looks good, doesn't it?

228
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:58,722
Yeah, it does. I can't believe
you guys actually pulled it off.

229
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:00,181
It looks great.

230
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:01,812
Good job.

231
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:04,515
So, you hungry?

232
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:06,278
Kinda.

233
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:08,638
Wanna go get something to eat,
work on our schedules?

234
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,216
I do...

235
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:11,766
bad.

236
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:13,435
But Billy

237
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:16,734
and I, we're gonna
head out of town to...

238
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:19,191
We gotta go pick up
a hydraulic lift at auction.

239
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:21,250
It's kind of a big deal, so...

240
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,945
- OK.
- Really, OK?

241
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,636
Hey, how'd it go with...

242
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:29,743
Mrs. Taylor today, your meeting?

243
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,871
It went fine.

244
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:37,032
- Sweet. What'd she want?
- Just wanted to talk about my schedule.

245
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:38,158
Did she?

246
00:14:39,152 --> 00:14:40,253
Perfect.

247
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,142
- Mr. Garth?
- Dr. Garth.

248
00:14:54,781 --> 00:14:57,187
- Can I help you?
- Hi, I'm Tyra Collette.

249
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,690
I'm on the wait list.

250
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:05,694
I just... I wanted
to tell you how much...

251
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,281
how much I appreciate
being on the list,

252
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:11,333
and how much I respect the process.

253
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,015
And I don't wanna rush it, but...

254
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:17,151
I just wanted to tell you that

255
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:20,748
going to UT has been a dream of mine

256
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:24,070
pretty much my entire life.
It's the dream.

257
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:28,009
And if there's anything I can do
to help my chances...

258
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,304
Do you have your letter with you?

259
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:35,745
- I do, it's... it's right here.
- Thanks.

260
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,985
Let's see.

261
00:15:42,046 --> 00:15:43,733
Miss Collette,
I need you to understand,

262
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:46,653
we get over 35,000 applications
each year.

263
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:50,365
And we put about
a thousand on the wait list.

264
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,425
A thousand?

265
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,272
So, a thousand people
got that letter?

266
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:01,166
Unfortunately, yeah.
That's the way the system works.

267
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:14,380
- You need to come to that meeting.
- Why?

268
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,490
To stand up for your job.

269
00:16:16,615 --> 00:16:19,340
There's nothing I could, should,
or need to say at that meeting.

270
00:16:19,465 --> 00:16:21,140
They can see what
I've done and decide.

271
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:23,891
If they want Joe McCoy
to take over this team...

272
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,275
that's their damn funeral!

273
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,241
I don't think
that's a good strategy.

274
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:32,073
- That's because it's not a strategy.
- I know.

275
00:16:32,563 --> 00:16:34,784
But I'm starting to think
that we're gonna need a strategy.

276
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:39,503
I can't outtalk nor outspend,
that's for damn sure, Joe McCoy.

277
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:40,633
I know.

278
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:46,032
I have given everything I've got
for this team.

279
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:49,674
I've still got that, I still got
my pride, I'm not giving that up.

280
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:52,532
Uh-uh, honey,
you're never gonna give up your pride.

281
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:57,057
But if you don't fight for this,
I think we're gonna regret it.

282
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:07,150
All right, we got
several good items here.

283
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,486
You can take a look around
and see there are things

284
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,656
you cannot buy in a store,
'cause they just would not sell 'em.

285
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,224
Right now, item #42 over here,

286
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:17,077
we got the Lincoln arc welding machine.
We got this barber chair...

287
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:18,828
That's stupid.

288
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,169
... item #28, that's an owl head,

289
00:17:21,294 --> 00:17:23,041
which is made
from a deer's rear end.

290
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,043
Who'll give me $25
on the owl head taxidermy?

291
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,544
That's a big owl, sitting there,
staring at you.

292
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,839
It's cool...
but no.

293
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:33,385
What do we got up next?
We got item #27,

294
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,536
we got this two-post
hydraulic lift, model NT9...

295
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:38,640
All right, let's get ready.
You ready?

296
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,352
Who'll give me 950? 950 over here,
now 1000. 1000 over here,

297
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,145
we got 1000.
Now... 1100.

298
00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:47,232
- Go, go!
- 1100, we got 1100, who'll go 1150?

299
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,674
- 1150 over here. Now 12. 12 over here.
- Get him, get him.

300
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,946
12, now 13. Who'll go 13?
Anybody go 13?

301
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:56,616
13? He's stealing it over here, friends.
You know they go for twice this.

302
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,618
1200 going once, 1200 going twice...

303
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:00,662
Sold for $1200

304
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,416
to the man from Dillon!
And sir, you stole that item, there.

305
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,711
Got it, Billy!

306
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:09,337
- We're gonna bring our next item...
- That was huge!

307
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,657
Take a gander to your left,
my right, friends,

308
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:14,217
and we have got
a Texas longhorn steer.

309
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:16,803
You could be riding
Beevo home tonight.

310
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,980
We have money left, don't we?

311
00:18:19,294 --> 00:18:22,057
I defy anyone
to pass through Riggins' Rigs

312
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,519
with that steer in front of it,
and not go inside.

313
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,684
If you get that,
you're making clients for life.

314
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,649
Listen to me.
Hey, listen to me.

315
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,537
Things happen for a reason, Billy.

316
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,746
And this guy right here,
he's one of 'em.

317
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:35,459
No regrets.

318
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:37,219
- All right.
- Look at that!

319
00:18:37,344 --> 00:18:39,784
Who's gonna give me $1500?
1500 over here...

320
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:43,615
OK, this is for...
great report card,

321
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:45,340
all your help around the house,

322
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:48,765
all your help with Gracie Belle,
I could not have done without you...

323
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:52,652
So for all that, and for being
the most beautiful, amazing daughter

324
00:18:52,777 --> 00:18:55,050
anyone could ever dream of...

325
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:00,350
Are you guys kidding me?

326
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:01,774
- It's mine?
- Yeah.

327
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:04,462
- It's not like a family shared, no?
- No.

328
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:09,383
We got the first payment, we split the
rest of the payments and the insurance.

329
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:11,256
Oh, my God, that's so rad!

330
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,191
- Honey!
- That'll do.

331
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,968
I didn't think about her driving it.

332
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:27,040
You hold her. I'm getting in there,
you're not going anywhere without me.

333
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:30,919
- You and I are staying safe right here.
- Wait for me, wait for me!

334
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:34,567
Plastic still on the floor!

335
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:36,416
Look at this!

336
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,113
I like it, I like it, I like it!

337
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:43,467
What?

338
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:47,851
- Is this not what you wanted?
- No, no, this is perfect.

339
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,825
This is perfect.

340
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:56,444
I don't know, it's stupid, I just...

341
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:01,593
I don't know.

342
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:03,395
I just...

343
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,703
I never thought that Matt would actually
move away to school, and...

344
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:15,342
all my friends would be
leaving high school, and...

345
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,836
Just kinda feeling left behind.

346
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:28,498
It's a lotta change.

347
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:33,141
And... and a lot of it's really,
you know, really good.

348
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,857
And I'm really proud of him,

349
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:38,165
and he's done a really,
really good job, and...

350
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:43,217
It's stupid.

351
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,552
- It's not stupid, honey.
- So stupid.

352
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,479
It's a hard, hard thing.

353
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:52,376
And y'all have had
a really nice relationship.

354
00:20:53,155 --> 00:20:55,908
And you don't know
what's gonna happen after that.

355
00:20:56,382 --> 00:21:00,101
If you are meant to be together,
you'll be together, and if you're not...

356
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,219
there's gonna be
somebody else special for you.

357
00:21:04,427 --> 00:21:05,929
But it's not Matt.

358
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,777
I know it's hard to say goodbye.

359
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:45,386
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

360
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,052
This is my grandson.

361
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:48,806
Morning, good to see you.

362
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,041
He's a quarterback.
Or used to be.

363
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,603
Yeah, I'm Matthew.
Bye, we'll see y'all in a bit.

364
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:55,605
Which hall is it?

365
00:21:56,593 --> 00:21:57,818
It's this one.

366
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,987
All right, put these there, too.

367
00:22:04,273 --> 00:22:07,843
- Matthew, you've gotta be exhausted.
- No, no, I'm good, I just...

368
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:10,495
I just want to help you
get all this stuff...

369
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,075
you know, put away.

370
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:16,367
- That can go on that shelf, there.
- Matthew.

371
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:19,113
- What?
- Go home.

372
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,781
Honey...

373
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:23,440
Go, I...

374
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:25,206
I'll be fine.

375
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:27,981
You got your chair, so...

376
00:22:34,032 --> 00:22:37,507
- All set? I'll talk to you later.
- OK. All right.

377
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:56,861
One in a thousand!

378
00:22:57,311 --> 00:23:00,336
One in a thousand... They should just
tell you on the application,

379
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,881
"Do not apply."

380
00:23:02,253 --> 00:23:03,781
I mean, what the hell?

381
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:07,278
You know what? It's fine, 
'cause I have a great job at Applebee's,

382
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:10,217
and my sister can get me a job
at the Landing Strip in no time.

383
00:23:10,342 --> 00:23:13,753
And you and I, why don't we just
get married and start popping 'em out?

384
00:23:13,878 --> 00:23:15,659
'Cause I'm gonna be here
forever, it seems.

385
00:23:15,784 --> 00:23:18,396
- OK, that's it, I can't take this
- One in a thousand!

386
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,129
one second longer.

387
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,882
- What are you doing?
- I cannot take you talking for another

388
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,720
two hours with this!

389
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:29,186
What the hell are you doing?

390
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,399
We're in the middle of nowhere!

391
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:33,995
I cannot take you feeling
sorry for yourself, Tyra!

392
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,588
You care so much about what
everyone else thinks about you!

393
00:23:36,713 --> 00:23:39,023
And what some idiot
in some college thinks about you.

394
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:41,836
Landry, it's not just one idiot, OK?

395
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,840
- I coulda sworn we'd been...
- No. When so many people tell you

396
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,600
one thing about yourself,
you start to believe it, OK?

397
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:50,511
So you know what?
Screw you!

398
00:23:51,187 --> 00:23:54,307
Screw you, Mr. 4.2-GPA-can-go-
wherever-the-hell-you-want!

399
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:57,106
Yeah, screw you. You don't have
a clue what my life's like,

400
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:59,758
or how hard this has been,
how hard I've worked!

401
00:23:59,883 --> 00:24:02,937
I've worked since I was 13
to frikking get here!

402
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:07,215
- You don't understand!
- Don't you just stop it for one second?

403
00:24:08,245 --> 00:24:11,240
OK, I don't care what anyone else
thinks about you.

404
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,910
I don't care what a counselor
thinks about you.

405
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:17,580
I don't care what you think about
yourself, but I believe in you, OK?

406
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:21,167
I could care less
what anyone else thinks.

407
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:23,362
I believe in you.

408
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:28,404
And I want this for you
more than anything.

409
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,803
But you just gotta start...
believe in yourself, Tyra.

410
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:49,558
You know,

411
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:53,115
maybe we shoulda got that steer towed,
because I think it taxed

412
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,521
- the engine too much.
- No kidding, dumbass!

413
00:24:55,646 --> 00:24:56,956
You know what else?

414
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:58,962
I hate San Antonio State!

415
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,915
- Who cares, Tim?
- Bars are junk.

416
00:25:01,557 --> 00:25:04,251
They don't even have a place
like Smitty's where I can just go relax,

417
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:06,921
- you know, and just be me.
- Maybe that's good for you, Tim.

418
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:10,496
I got 4 classes all in a row.
There's no "me" time, Billy.

419
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:14,220
I'm getting these books,
they... are like 800 pages long!

420
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:17,390
- Where's the "me" time, Billy?
- What are you talking about?

421
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,267
Would you shut up for 2 seconds,
and try and crank the engine. Please!

422
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:23,000
- Thank you!
- I'm telling you my deal.

423
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,927
I don't care about your deal!

424
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,445
- Crank it!
- I'm cranking!

425
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,958
- I ask you a question?
- What?

426
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:41,539
- Why mess with the alternator?
- It's not generating enough juice.

427
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:44,404
Yeah, it is, man.
It's the timing.

428
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,045
How would you know?

429
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,754
Oh, you gotta listen to this baby.
She'll talk to you, man.

430
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,143
Really? What are you,
the car whisperer, Tim?

431
00:25:51,268 --> 00:25:53,592
Seriously, I just put a new
distributor in there a week ago.

432
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:56,721
Serious, give her a whirl now.

433
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,107
Just try it.

434
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:14,989
Billy, we got it started,
what are you pouting about?

435
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:17,832
I just bought
a frikking repair shop, Tim,

436
00:26:17,957 --> 00:26:20,119
and I can't even fix
my own damn car!

437
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:28,461
Shoulda never bought
that damn garage, man! Seriously!

438
00:26:29,098 --> 00:26:31,454
If I don't start making money
like right now,

439
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:33,758
I'm gonna lose that property,
I'm gonna lose everything.

440
00:26:34,036 --> 00:26:35,496
Be back down to zero!

441
00:26:35,818 --> 00:26:38,554
You know what, Billy? You buying
that garage was the best damn thing

442
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,986
you've done your entire life.
You're living the American dream.

443
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:43,768
- Please!
- You have your own business,

444
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,905
you're gonna have
your own employees.

445
00:26:46,161 --> 00:26:48,510
You'll be able to go home,
hang with the wife,

446
00:26:48,635 --> 00:26:51,233
have a beer here and there, and watch
your kids grow up in front of you.

447
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:53,317
It's pretty darn cool, man.

448
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,185
You don't believe a word
that you're saying, do you?

449
00:26:58,322 --> 00:27:00,409
Funny thing is, I wish
I was in your shoes, man.

450
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:03,893
It'd be pretty cool, huh?

451
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:06,757
The Riggins brothers...

452
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:10,419
sitting around all day,
fixing cars, drinking beer.

453
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,561
Anyway...

454
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:19,872
it better work.

455
00:27:22,647 --> 00:27:24,070
Mindy's pregnant.

456
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:27,144
What?
Say that again.

457
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:29,250
Mindy's pregnant!

458
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:34,193
- For real?
- Yeah, hundred percent!

459
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,237
Don't go telling everybody
about this, either.

460
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,449
Hundred percent, we have
a little football coming our way?

461
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,201
- Something like that.
- You're kidding me!

462
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,121
Are you kidding me?
Congratulations, Billy!

463
00:27:51,314 --> 00:27:53,563
You got a kid and your own business?

464
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:55,898
- That's incredible!
- Get off of me!

465
00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:01,627
It's a beautiful car,
great gas mileage.

466
00:28:01,797 --> 00:28:05,687
Like I say, it's a family car now.
You know, when we were kids, it was...

467
00:28:05,857 --> 00:28:08,324
it was all about sporty, but this is...
Look at this!

468
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:10,559
- Hey, baby!
- Hi, Daddy.

469
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,870
Excuse me just a minute.
Go ahead, take a seat.

470
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:16,068
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

471
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,130
- What?
- I think we should talk to Uncle Gary.

472
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,413
Mama, we don't show her the letter
till tomorrow, after the wedding.

473
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,916
I know how you feel,
but I just don't think that's right.

474
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,718
{\- It's unethical!
- }I can't have her being all mopey

475
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:35,136
- and Tyra-ish the whole time.
- I know, but it's not right.

476
00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:36,952
- And not ethical!
- It <i>is</i> uneth...

477
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:38,966
What's not right?
What're you talking about?

478
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,474
What is that?

479
00:28:42,315 --> 00:28:44,016
- What is it?
- It's from UT.

480
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:45,931
- Oh, my God!
- Just a first receipt!

481
00:28:46,904 --> 00:28:48,892
Just wait like a couple days!

482
00:28:56,678 --> 00:28:57,683
It came!

483
00:28:58,143 --> 00:29:00,154
- Is that the letter?
- It came!

484
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,283
- It's thin. I wonder what that means.
- That doesn't mean anything...

485
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,516
All letters are thin.
Are you gonna open it?

486
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:08,007
I'm afraid.

487
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:11,640
Look at me. You deserve this, OK?
I can honestly say you have worked

488
00:29:11,765 --> 00:29:13,832
harder than anyone
could have worked for this, OK?

489
00:29:13,957 --> 00:29:16,993
- You'll love me no matter what?
- No matter what, I promise.

490
00:29:17,812 --> 00:29:19,882
All right.
I'm obviously...

491
00:29:20,232 --> 00:29:21,248
shaking.

492
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,440
- What did I tell you?
- I got in.

493
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:47,159
Oh, my baby's going to college!
My baby's going to college!

494
00:29:47,527 --> 00:29:49,114
I'm so proud of you!

495
00:29:49,602 --> 00:29:51,288
- I love you.
- I love you.

496
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:54,982
Oh, my God!

497
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,338
I'm proud of you.

498
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,720
Now it's time to move on
to our final piece of business today.

499
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:10,557
Mr. McCoy! Have you had a chance
to speak with Wade about his interest

500
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,388
in coming in as head coach?

501
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:16,271
Yes, Mr. Superintendent, I have.

502
00:30:16,878 --> 00:30:19,007
Wade is ready and eager
to take on the position.

503
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:22,133
All right.
Now, as far as salary goes...

504
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:25,817
He'll take whatever we give him,
or I will personally kick his ass.

505
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,661
All kidding aside,
Wade understands that this is a...

506
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:33,580
first-year coaching position.
He knows the range.

507
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,838
Bottom line is, he gets it.

508
00:30:36,258 --> 00:30:37,265
Thank you.

509
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,712
All right, then.
Now, before we put this to a vote,

510
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:44,675
let me ask if anyone else would like
to speak on behalf of Coach Aikmen...

511
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:46,690
or Coach Taylor.

512
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,846
I did not want to be here today.

513
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:07,979
Here I am.

514
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:13,829
I love my job, I'm good at it,
and I'd like to keep it.

515
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:17,712
I love this school,

516
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:19,689
I love the kids.

517
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:23,721
And I feel like
I've just gotten started here.

518
00:31:25,374 --> 00:31:28,148
There's some people here
who want to replace me

519
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:31,637
for a man with an awful lot of money

520
00:31:32,116 --> 00:31:33,389
and a boy

521
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,829
with a good arm.

522
00:31:38,078 --> 00:31:40,036
To those people I would say,

523
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,303
you're wrong.

524
00:31:45,078 --> 00:31:46,759
You are dead wrong.

525
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,918
You all have a good Saturday.

526
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:03,712
Stay still, stay still.

527
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:03,062
You gotta be kidding me.

528
00:33:08,371 --> 00:33:10,903
They offered the job to Wade Aikmen.

529
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:18,328
All right, now we know.

530
00:33:19,575 --> 00:33:20,743
And, hon...

531
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:24,765
the board would like
to offer you the position

532
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,836
of head coach at East Dillon High.

533
00:34:43,024 --> 00:34:44,629
Well, hello, gorgeous!

534
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:47,189
This... is for you.

535
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:51,139
Thanks.

536
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:58,559
I gotta tell you something.

537
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:02,348
Shoot.

538
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:06,238
Yesterday...

539
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:10,277
when you were at...
the auction?

540
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,551
I had this...

541
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:17,709
crazy idea in my head that
Principal Taylor and my dad

542
00:35:18,403 --> 00:35:19,404
put in...

543
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:23,351
just about me going to Vanderbilt,
and that I can still go and...

544
00:35:23,476 --> 00:35:26,542
So we went to my uncle and got the money
so that I could go, and...

545
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:30,264
I'm not gonna go, and I don't wanna go.
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry

546
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:33,497
that I would even think of doing that
without talking to you first...

547
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:34,622
Go.

548
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:36,594
What?

549
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:40,962
You need to go to Vanderbilt.

550
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,076
- I don't want to.
- Is that what you want?

551
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:45,725
- No. What I want is to be with you.
- Listen to me.

552
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:49,371
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

553
00:35:50,638 --> 00:35:52,022
So much.

554
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:53,996
And this...

555
00:35:54,926 --> 00:35:56,613
San Antonio State...

556
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:01,809
You're so much better than that.
So much.

557
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:05,287
We know this, we know this.
And these opportunities...

558
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:08,101
happen for a reason.

559
00:36:12,499 --> 00:36:14,878
I'm not gonna be that guy
that stopped you

560
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,531
from achieving your dreams.

561
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,161
- Look, we...
- Don't let me be that guy.

562
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:33,666
Go.

563
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,261
You don't wanna dance?

564
00:37:50,973 --> 00:37:51,977
Not really.

565
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,081
So...

566
00:37:59,774 --> 00:38:02,823
I don't wanna be all Debbie Downer
at the wedding or anything, but...

567
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,031
I've been thinking.

568
00:38:07,436 --> 00:38:09,566
Look, you're going away to college.

569
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:13,283
You're gonna meet new people
and have new experiences, and...

570
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,008
take different classes, and...

571
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,342
meet a lot of new girls, and...

572
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:21,563
I don't wanna be
that high school couple

573
00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:24,848
that has to stay together
just to prove everybody wrong,

574
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:27,337
and gets in fights all the time
over the phone,

575
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:29,222
and never sees each other...

576
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,061
And I love you...

577
00:38:36,258 --> 00:38:37,980
I just think we should break up.

578
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:47,199
- It's not really a yes or no question.
- Too bad, 'cause we're not breaking up.

579
00:38:48,873 --> 00:38:50,701
Julie, I love you.

580
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:53,844
We're gonna be fine.
Come here.

581
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:58,361
It's gonna be OK.

582
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:00,801
All right?

583
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:14,572
Your grandma would've
really liked this wedding.

584
00:39:18,884 --> 00:39:20,231
Yeah, she would.

585
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,135
Hey, Grandma!

586
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,989
Matthew!
What are you doing here, honey?

587
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,138
Get up, take the curlers
out of your hair,

588
00:39:36,263 --> 00:39:38,432
and we're gonna go to a wedding, OK?

589
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:41,410
- That's crazy, sweetie.
- No. We're gonna go to a wedding,

590
00:39:41,535 --> 00:39:43,880
and then I'm gonna take you home.
For good.

591
00:39:44,379 --> 00:39:46,429
Honey. No, you can't do that...

592
00:39:46,554 --> 00:39:48,093
No, I can't... Listen.

593
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,470
You're the only person
who's never left me.

594
00:39:51,978 --> 00:39:53,264
I'm not gonna leave you.

595
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,460
You mean go back home?

596
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,240
I'm gonna stay here.

597
00:40:04,158 --> 00:40:06,110
My chair!
I'm gonna need my chair.

598
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:36,659
It's kind of a sucky day, hon.

599
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:39,394
Well, the rib eye was good.

600
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:45,104
I don't even know
what the hell we're doing here.

601
00:40:45,229 --> 00:40:47,360
I don't even know
Billy Riggins that well.

602
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:49,820
I think they think
very highly of us.

603
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,406
- Hi.
- Hi.

604
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:04,079
You know what?

605
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:08,428
No matter what happens,
no matter where you go,

606
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:10,103
no matter what you do,

607
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:13,219
I'm always gonna be behind you.

608
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:17,319
Always, and always, and always.

609
00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:21,720
I know that.

610
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:26,540
I know that.

611
00:42:19,149 --> 00:42:21,486
Look, everybody's all... lined up.

612
00:42:21,611 --> 00:42:23,636
Come on,
there's some place I wanna go.

613
00:42:23,761 --> 00:42:26,542
- Gimme the keys, I'm driving.
- Don't worry about the keys.

614
00:42:37,217 --> 00:42:39,973
- Hey, I need a minute.
- You're kidding me!

615
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:43,058
- No, I need a minute. Gimme a minute.
- You're an ass.

616
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,853
- What?
- Lyla's going to Vanderbilt.

617
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,688
- So what?
- So everything!

618
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,497
She was the sole purpose of me going
to college. Now, I don't have to go,

619
00:42:51,622 --> 00:42:53,360
I'm staying in Dillon,
is what it means.

620
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,239
Riggins' Rigs!
We're in it together now!

621
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:59,294
We're gonna be popping beer,
making money, getting off early!

622
00:42:59,419 --> 00:43:01,452
I'm telling you!
You're not getting it, Billy!

623
00:43:02,011 --> 00:43:04,915
Come here! You listen to me,
you little idiot.

624
00:43:06,591 --> 00:43:10,338
You're not gonna wuss out on this.
You're gonna go to college get a degree.

625
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,004
And I don't care if it takes you

626
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:14,526
seven years, all right?
And when you start thinking

627
00:43:14,651 --> 00:43:17,636
that it's too hard, or that you can't
handle it, remember one thing.

628
00:43:18,241 --> 00:43:20,960
I want you to think about the kids
that you don't have yet,

629
00:43:21,085 --> 00:43:23,366
and I want you to think
about my kids,

630
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:25,977
me and Mindy's kids,
that we don't have yet.

631
00:43:26,382 --> 00:43:27,686
And you'll get the job done,

632
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,856
so that I can tell them that they don't
have to settle for second best,

633
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:33,460
that they can be
whoever they want to be,

634
00:43:33,585 --> 00:43:36,852
because their uncle Timmy
went to college.

635
00:43:38,554 --> 00:43:41,500
God bless our mom and dad,
wherever the hell they are.

636
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,412
But we gotta do better by our kids.

637
00:43:46,114 --> 00:43:47,364
Do you hear me?

638
00:43:49,448 --> 00:43:50,937
- Tim!
- I thought...

639
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:52,354
Do you hear me?

640
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:56,802
All right.

641
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:00,554
I gotta get out of here
and go to Portico.

642
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,190
So don't...
torch the house.

643
00:44:03,532 --> 00:44:04,685
No promises.

644
00:44:10,717 --> 00:44:11,717
Have fun.

645
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:37,373
Love you!
