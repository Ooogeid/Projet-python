1
00:00:03,174 --> 00:00:04,666
- Sorry.
- What are you doing?

2
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:07,002
I guess I feel closer to God
if I'm with you.

3
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:10,130
- Did you think it was gonna work on me?
- It's not a line.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,592
I don't need nothing from you! I don't
need to work at your cardealership.

5
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:15,635
And I sure as hell don't need football.

6
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:19,305
You have the opportunity
to become part of a team.

7
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:21,141
If you don't do it tonight,

8
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:23,642
you're never gonna do it
in your entire life.

9
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:25,394
- It's that girl.
- Noelle?

10
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:27,066
She got my son's head

11
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:29,774
spinin' every which way direction.
I don't like it.

12
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:32,819
Do you think maybe
we should like talk about some...

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,405
ground rules,
so that we both know

14
00:00:35,665 --> 00:00:38,283
how we each feel,
that no one will get hurt...

15
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:40,118
What are we gonna do with Gracie Bell

16
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:43,079
- while we're at work?
- That's not our burden,

17
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:44,544
that is our gift.

18
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:49,836
Oh yeah. I think we could definitly
have her there by 7:00.

19
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:52,756
- Which daycare's that?
- The good one with the waiting list.

20
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:54,633
Sure, that would be great.

21
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:56,426
I cannot thank you enough

22
00:00:56,686 --> 00:00:58,970
- for taking her so last minute.
- You saw my homework?

23
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,223
- Why did they have an opening?
- One of the kid dropped out.

24
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:04,221
Is that the one with the busy traffic?

25
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:07,436
Can you hold on one second?
It's on *side street.

26
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:09,646
They got a gate,
they got a surity code.

27
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:13,187
- I left my homework right here.
- Was the reason they have an opening?

28
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:15,111
Maybe because
of the traffic on the street.

29
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:16,655
Wonderful, we'll be there.

30
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:21,701
Honey, honey, it's gonna be fine.
It miraculous they took us in.

31
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:24,162
Take Julie to school
and I'll take Gracie.

32
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:26,122
Now wait a second. I am calm.

33
00:01:26,382 --> 00:01:29,584
You're a little worked up.
I think it's better you let me do it.

34
00:01:29,845 --> 00:01:31,916
You can take Jules.
Come here, baby girl.

35
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:35,151
- Seriously, I need to find my homework.
- Say "bye, daddy."

36
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:37,050
It's under the newspapers.

37
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,885
You could've told me that earlier.

38
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:41,549
Say bye to Gracie bell.
She's going to day care!

39
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:43,802
Bye, y'all.

40
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:49,154
Matthew, you have always
loved pancakes

41
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:51,481
and I'm gonna make some.

42
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,274
Well, that's...

43
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:55,110
a lot of baking soda, Grandma.

44
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,989
I've been making these
for 40 years.

45
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,622
I guess I know how to do it.

46
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:02,116
You usually eat about ten of these,
so hope you're hungry.

47
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:06,596
Well, I'm eating this banana now,
so I might not be that hungry later.

48
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:08,731
That's a joke.

49
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,187
What are you doing?

50
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:15,505
Could... Could you reach
my suitcase, please?

51
00:02:16,196 --> 00:02:18,549
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?

52
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:22,679
Thank you.
Guatema.

53
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,293
What, for, like, vacation?

54
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:31,907
I have to go home Matt.
My family needs me.

55
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:33,606
Why?
I don't understand,

56
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:35,775
- 'cause you're supposed to...
- Did he tell you?

57
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:37,569
I'm making my pancakes.

58
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,665
You are in for a treat...

59
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,656
- Sounds delicious.
- Y'all come on,

60
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:44,794
you gotta get 'em
while they're hot.

61
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:47,705
Matthew has loved these
since he was a little boy.

62
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:50,987
I'll clean up after myself.
Don't worry about it.

63
00:02:53,228 --> 00:02:56,164
Yep, cmnnamon d en
a special ingrient.*

64
00:02:58,288 --> 00:03:00,310
Looks like a nice neighborhood.

65
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:05,597
Fun little playground.

66
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:09,142
Children coughing.

67
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:12,312
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi, Mrs. Taylor.

68
00:03:12,573 --> 00:03:14,464
Good.
I'll be with you inust one minute.

69
00:03:14,624 --> 00:03:16,107
Oh, okay, great.

70
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:20,467
Well, this is such a big day for you,
Gracie Bell.

71
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:26,392
eat and... play and...

72
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,692
Nap and do all those things
that you love to do so much.

73
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:33,371
You're not gonna wonder

74
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:36,461
why I left you with a bunch of people
that we don't know and never met.

75
00:03:40,976 --> 00:03:42,080
I agree.

76
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:46,534
Come on back...
tomorrow maybe.

77
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,808
I think you're absolutely right.

78
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:54,312
I think maybe today
wasn't the best day for it.

79
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,205

I'm gonna be in the streets, homie.

102
00:05:51,105 --> 00:05:52,997
Hi, reverend Philips,
I'm so sorry I'm late.

103
00:05:53,157 --> 00:05:54,097
It's okay.

104
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:56,309
The phones are ringing off,
they're waiting.

105
00:05:56,737 --> 00:05:58,978
- Chris kennedy. Nice to meet you.
- Lyla Garrity.

106
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:03,191
Good early morning and welcome
to <i>I was a teenage christian</i>, I'm Chris.

107
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:05,567
This is Lyla, it's her first day,
be nice to her.

108
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:07,402
We're on to our next caller.

109
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:09,840
She has a question about sex.
Go for it, Lorena.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,239
<i>Hi, I have a question for Lyla.</i>

111
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:17,178
<i>I'm 17 and a christian</i>

112
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:19,957
<i>and I'm kind of confused
because I'm horny all the time.</i>

113
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:22,250
<i>And my boyfriend,
who's also a christian,</i>

114
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:24,820
<i>is also horny all the time
and he keeps telling me</i>

115
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:27,131
<i>that all this stuff we're doing
isn't a sin</i>

116
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,941
<i>and I guess tenically it's not...</i>

117
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,678
Okay, what was your question exactly?

118
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:38,913
<i>I guess...
Is oral sex considered intercourse?</i>

119
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:41,020
<i>And even if it's not,
is it okay?</i>

120
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:46,150
I'm gonna take this one for Lyla
'cause is her first day.

121
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:49,404
It's a little early in the morning
to be defining intercourse

122
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:53,950
Since you're asking, I'm gonna say
that technally, biblically,

123
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:58,745
oral sex is not intercourse,
but I don't think that's why you called.

124
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:02,000
It sounds like you're not feeling okay
about these things you're doing.

125
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,103
Am I right?

126
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:05,712
Actually, I'm not okay with a lot of.

127
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,589
Thank you.

128
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:12,217
- I'll be right back. Hey, sweetie.
- I need to talk to you.

129
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:13,885
I've got a meeting with...

130
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,973
- principal Bracker.
- Just five minutes.

131
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:21,269
Hello, Glen, Gracie.

132
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:24,583
I had a hard time leaving her
at daycare today.

133
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:26,349
It was hard for us.

134
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:28,233
I thought today...

135
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,612
Listen, I really want to help out,
but I gotta go to class.

136
00:07:32,874 --> 00:07:34,158
I'll take her.

137
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,703
Actually, you knon what,
since you're here...

138
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:41,495
You want to go say hi to daddy?
Thanks, baby.

139
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:44,374
It's a quick meeting.
It's just a statistics thing.

140
00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:47,003
- Ten minutes. Ten minutes.
- Ten!

141
00:07:47,263 --> 00:07:48,256
Thanks, bye.

142
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,770
She needs to have
her diaper changed, I think.

143
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,843
All right.

144
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,012
- Have a good day.
- You betcha.

145
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:58,730
You have a good one.
Thanks very much.

146
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:03,895
I know I'm cool,
got 'em for free too.

147
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,647
Can't even tell you where got 'em.

148
00:08:06,907 --> 00:08:08,691
You ain't learning nothing
from O.J, huh?

149
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:12,737
- Hey, y'all fools need to go home.
- "We got jungle fever..."

150
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,949
You can dance, red?
I didn't know you had rhythm like that.

151
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,660
Save a little for the rest of us.
Come on, Smash.

152
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,882
My parents want you,
your mom and your sisters

153
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,909
to come over for dinner tomorrow night.

154
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:26,501
- You think you can make it?
- Meet the parents, huh?

155
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:30,254
- If you're inclined.
- Yeah, I'd love that.

156
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:32,128
Good.

157
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:36,636
4-4 Smash when I go a-gap...

158
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,019
Dude, it's the Dillon Panthers!

159
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:43,642
Get in the car, dog.

160
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:46,604
And don't tell me
that you got homework to do, okay?

161
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:49,023
'Cause I'll kick your ass.
We're riding tonight.

162
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:51,358
Old times.
Let's go, dog.

163
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,735
All right, homie.

164
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,113
We got him!
We got him!

00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:57,907

166
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:01,216

167
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:07,492
You know little Lexie, right?
Chuco's little brother...

168
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,228
with the stuttering problem?

169
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:10,479
Like that, right?

170
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,090
This dud gets out two weeks ago,
and gets busted the same day!

171
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,342
The stupid!
Not like us, homie.

172
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:18,990
- Professionals right?
- No doubt.

173
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:22,527
That's right, homes. When we're going
to work, man? What's up?

174
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:25,935
I'm gonna give it at least two weeks
before I go back in.

175
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:28,312
Hey, yo,
I should go inside or whatever.

176
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:30,233
Damn.

177
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,299
Who's this guy?

178
00:09:32,795 --> 00:09:34,527
He's helping me out,
letting me stay here.

179
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:37,905
- This is his new lover, guys.
- Everything all right?

180
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,725
These are some...
These are my friends.

181
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:46,621
- There's Devon.
- Devon, how you doing?

182
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:50,084
- How you doing?
- AJ, Jesse, and Rishon.

183
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:56,215
- Y'all, this is Buddy Garrity.
- Cool. Yeah.

184
00:09:56,977 --> 00:09:58,995
- Nice to meet you guys.
- You too.

185
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:00,627
You friends of...

186
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:02,345
Friends of the sandman here?

187
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:04,127
- Friends of who?
- Sandman!

188
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:05,489
The sandman?

189
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:08,972
- Some football name.
- Okay, it's a football stuff.

190
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:12,064
Tell you what, if you're his friends,
you're welcome over here any time.

191
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:14,941
- Is that right?
- Yeah. <i>Mi casa, es su casa.</i>

192
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:20,658
You guys wanna come over Thursday night
for pizza, watch a movie, whatever?

193
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:23,116
Sounds great.
Thank you so much.

194
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:26,254
- Buddy Garrity?
- That's right.

195
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:29,122
I seen your car commercials!
Helll, yeah, man.

196
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:31,229
Hey, that's a nice ride
you guys got there.

197
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:33,449
Buddy Garrity, all right!

198
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:35,445
Nice guys.

199
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:41,757
Oh, honey.

200
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,214
I just...
I looked at her little face

201
00:10:44,374 --> 00:10:46,557
and I could not...
I couldn't leave her there.

202
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:48,734
We ran.
It was like we ran for our lives.

203
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:49,908
I understand.

204
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,396
It was like we were escaping
from prison, wasn't it?

205
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,052
- She's our baby.
- She's our baby.

206
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,403
Try again tomorrow.
There's no rush.

207
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,489
Thank you for being so understanding.

208
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,250
I have my moments.

209
00:11:03,503 --> 00:11:04,564
I know you do.

210
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:08,219
Go to your daddy.

211
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:10,360
Oh, not you again.

212
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,606
I don't know
how I'm gonna bring myself

213
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:15,241
to leave her with a bunch
of strangers tomorrow either.

214
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:18,005
Not you again! What are you
doing here? Who are you?

215
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:19,552
Where do you come from?

216
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:21,622
Where do you come from?

217
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:33,656
Beep beep, coming through.
Hi y'all.

218
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,217
Sorry about that.
Good to see you.

219
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:38,655
Hey, sweetie.
How's that calculus going?

220
00:11:40,788 --> 00:11:42,363
Nice. So you wimp out again?

221
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,407
Honey, I did not wimp out.

222
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:46,912
Don't call your mother a wimp.
It's demeaning.

223
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:48,480
Gracie was not ready to go.

224
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,821
When Gracie's ready to go,
Gracie will go.

225
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,875
So you're just gonna
cart her around

226
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:54,405
until she's married?

227
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:55,751
No.

228
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:59,088
- I'm not.
- All right.

229
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:00,876
- Good luck, Gracie.
- Love you.

230
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:03,314
- Have a very good day.
- Love you, mom. Bye.

231
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:09,807
Carlota's leaving.
She's going back to Guatemala.

232
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:11,781
The hot maid that you told me about?

233
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,603
She's not a maid, she's a nurse!
She's in nursing school.

234
00:12:14,863 --> 00:12:16,170
She studies a lot.

235
00:12:17,107 --> 00:12:19,249
Yeah, that's her
and she's leaving.

236
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:20,714
And she is hot.

237
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:27,728
You're not sleeping
with the hot maid, are you?

238
00:12:28,128 --> 00:12:30,109
- Kinda.
- Are you serious?

239
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:32,375
It's kinda cool.

240
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,591
I don't...

241
00:12:36,985 --> 00:12:39,152
I'm speechless.
I don't even know what to say.

242
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:41,297
You don't need to say anything,
it's fine.

243
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:43,748
- I'm... I'm proud.
- Thanks.

244
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,551
Now she's going back to Guatemala.

245
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:51,002
- Why is she...
- She's got family stuff going on there.

246
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:53,199
And there's nothing I can do.
I'm in high school,

247
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:55,571
I can't... do that.

248
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:58,018
You haven't developed feelings
or anything for her?

249
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,428
I had develop feelings,

250
00:12:59,588 --> 00:13:01,475
- serious feelings.
- So do you love her?

251
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,265
I think so.

252
00:13:03,787 --> 00:13:05,446
Don't go there, all right?

253
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:08,317
Whether I love her or not,
she's leaving. It doesn't matter.

254
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:10,874
She's going back to Guatemala
and now I'm stuck.

255
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:13,107
This is Lyla Garrity

256
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,864
and you're listening to
<i>I was a Teenage Christian</i>.

257
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:19,691
<i>Am I on the air?</i>

258
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:21,212
Yeah, you're on the air.

259
00:13:21,472 --> 00:13:23,005
<i>Oh, my God, I'm on the air!</i>

260
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:28,389
Um, this is... Tina
and I'm from Waco.

261
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:30,805
Why Waco?

262
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,782
<i>And, I'm kind of</i>

263
00:13:33,224 --> 00:13:35,139
embarrassed saying this, but...

264
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:37,603
I mean, I think Jesus was hot.

265
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:39,011
<i>So hot.</i>

266
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:41,065
He kind of looks like a movie star.

267
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:45,194
Okay, the image
that you have in your head

268
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:47,526
of what Christ looks like
probably has very little

269
00:13:47,686 --> 00:13:50,533
to do with reality.
That image has been generated

270
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:52,665
<i>by hundreds of years of artists...</i>

271
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:56,080
- What is going on out here?
- <i>... being italian, so there really</i>

272
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,853
is no say as to what
he actually looks like.

273
00:13:59,013 --> 00:14:00,149
Is that Lyla?

274
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,214
<i>One more.</i>

275
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:07,883
What's the deal
with the shroud of Turin?

276
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:09,218
<i>What's up with that?</i>

277
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:12,254
Again, no one really knows

278
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:16,851
- whether or not that's true, so...
- So,

279
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:20,201
Someone just painted
his face on a sheet?

280
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,069
Listen, I know you think
this is funny but it's not, it's rude.

281
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:26,482
And there's real people
calling in with real questions,

282
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:28,237
so I'm gonna disconnect now.

283
00:14:28,963 --> 00:14:31,536
Yes, and we're moving on to Karen.

284
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:33,611
That was a success.

285
00:14:34,297 --> 00:14:36,316
Is your way of telling her you like her?

286
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:52,386
Garrity, what's going on?

287
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:55,553
What's your problem?

288
00:14:55,872 --> 00:14:58,017
I know that was you
calling in to the radio show,

289
00:14:58,358 --> 00:15:00,293
trying to make me look like an idiot.

290
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:02,312
Why would you do that to me?

291
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:05,898
I... thought it was funny.

292
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:09,670
- To be honest with you.
- You thought it was funny?

293
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:11,839
Do you ever think
about what you're doing?

294
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:13,661
About who you might be hurting?

295
00:15:15,283 --> 00:15:17,940
I am doing that show,
getting up at 4:00 in the morning

296
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,308
and after school,

297
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,694
trying to help people who might not
have anyone else to turn to.

298
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:25,389
Does that sound like something
you want to screw with?

299
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,921
Then don't mess with me
on the air, please.

300
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:32,718
Maybe...

301
00:15:32,978 --> 00:15:35,054
think about why you do things you do.

302
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:42,979
Good night.

303
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:01,121
You're lucky we came.

304
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,502
How you doing?

305
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:12,382
Thank you.

306
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:14,734
We got that recipe
on our trip to Spain.

307
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:17,596
- I'll show you how to make it.
- I'd love that.

308
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:19,473
Can we go play with the Wii?

309
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,559
- Of course.
- Y'all got a Wii?

310
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,435
- Oh, I'm coming...
- Smash!

311
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:25,980
I'm kidding.
I'm just playing.

312
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,121
Sheila, you wanna come play too?

313
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,658
You know you want
to play with the Wii, girl.

314
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:34,251
Hey, I got winner.

315
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,415
Take turns, amy.

316
00:16:40,663 --> 00:16:41,954
Well, uh, Corrina.

317
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,339
Now that it's just us here,

318
00:16:44,856 --> 00:16:47,084
- could I ask you a question?
- Sure.

319
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:50,202
How do you feel
about Smash and Noelle?

320
00:16:56,164 --> 00:16:58,932
I may be wrong,
but I don't think I am.

321
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:00,556
This relationship...

322
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:04,031
it just scares me.

323
00:17:04,612 --> 00:17:05,728
It scares you?

324
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:07,271
Yeah, it scares me.

325
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,960
Your son is a fine young man, Corrina.

326
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,694
But you know we live
in Dillon, Texas,

327
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,002
and you know that Dillon, Texas
has its ways, right?

328
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:19,783
And I don't think that we want to have

329
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:22,461
anyone wondering and worrying
about what's going on here,

330
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,163
I think that...

331
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,914
Well, no one else is gonna be
so open-minded about it.

332
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,544
With all due respect,
the world has changed.

333
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:32,588
I wish that were true, Smash.

334
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,337
I have to admit

335
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,093
I would feel a lot more comfortable
if you and Noelle,

336
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:40,236
stop dating.

337
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:43,466
I'm sorry.
That's how I feel.

338
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,686
I have to say I agree.

339
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:59,113
Righ here, see what I'm talking about?

340
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,940
You got the three receivers set
when they go into tlat.

341
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:04,828
You know, I saw Tami
and the baby ain today.

342
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:07,204
Yeah, I know.
It's day three.

343
00:18:07,364 --> 00:18:10,084
Every time they pass
they end up moving around to the rig.

344
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:12,776
Sometimes I wish Tami'd
just stay home,

345
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:15,172
raise Gracie,
and quit the damn job.

346
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:17,383
Hell if I'm gonna say that to her.

347
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,594
You can get rid of that
if you just force 'em to go left there.

348
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:23,222
You got a right
to your opinion, you know?

349
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:25,888
I'm not so sure I do.
I'm not gonna ask her to do something

350
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:27,685
that I woun't be able to do myself.

351
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,712
That's 'cause you're
not supposed to.

352
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:32,314
That's 'cause men aren't built that way.
But women are.

353
00:18:32,883 --> 00:18:35,629
They're supposed to want
to stay home with the kids.

354
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,989
What the hell am I supposed to do?

355
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:42,243
Shs got a career.
She loves her work.

356
00:18:42,837 --> 00:18:44,994
She has spent 16 years at home
with the first kid.

357
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,157
I'm just saying that I wouldn't let
a woman of mine go to work

358
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:49,790
if she had a kid at home.

359
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,127
That sounds really stupid and ignorant
when you say that out loud.

360
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:56,198
Well, sometimes the truth
is stupid and ignorant.

361
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:59,632
Then I gave up cheerleading
last June.

362
00:18:59,894 --> 00:19:03,171
After everything I'd been through
it was kind of ridiculous

363
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:06,582
to be cheering in a little skirt
for a guy to throw a ball.

364
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:09,642
I actually burned my uniform.

365
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:13,201
- What?
- I was feeling a little dramatic.

366
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:17,935
What were the sequence of events
that lead you from lighting up

367
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:19,402
to join the church?

368
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:22,934
I felt lost.

369
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:27,586
You know my...
my whole life sort of blew up.

370
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:31,614
In the previous six months,
my parents split up and...

371
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:35,209
a few other things
that I won't get into.

372
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:38,591
God was just the only source
of comfort at that time.

373
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,645
That relationship
just grew and grew

374
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:47,114
I think it's always out there,
you know, just waiting for us.

375
00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:49,025
Definitely.

376
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:50,590
Definitely.

377
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:54,677
You are an interesting girl,
Lyla Garrity.

378
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:57,465
It's too bad you're so hard on the eyes.

379
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,401
- Thanks
- You're welcome.

380
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:10,090
If everybody in the whole world

381
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:12,840
would just not look
at what's on the outside

382
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:15,625
and don't judge people
by the way they look,

383
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:18,920
but instead see into their hearts
and see their souls.

384
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:22,987
If that's what we did,
the world would just a better place.

385
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:24,717
That's the whole thing.

386
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:28,418
You just have to have faith in people.

387
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,384
Let me ask you a question.

388
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,901
If you had a gold watch,

389
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:41,038
an antique goldwatch
that your grandfather gave you,

390
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:44,845
would you leave it in your house
with a bunch of thugs?

391
00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:47,315
I don't believe I would.

392
00:20:49,777 --> 00:20:51,227
Chicken's good, hon.

393
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:55,164
- Good job with the beans and the corn.
- Just go ahead and say it.

394
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,046
Say what?

395
00:20:57,206 --> 00:21:00,378
You know, day three,
I didn't take in Gracie to the day care.

396
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,746
I know you think I'm being weak
and over protective.

397
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:06,401
I know. Just get it out.

398
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:10,263
No, I don't.

399
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:13,015
If you'd been there,
you wouldn't have been so brave either.

400
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,561
I happened to have offered
to drop her off.

401
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:18,848
- But that was not an option.
- You made me well aware of that.

402
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:21,536
It wasn't an option.
You we absolutely not

403
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:23,297
in the right mind for it.

404
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:26,320
- Are you guys fighting?
- No, we're not. Eat your dinner.

405
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:29,824
There are other options.

406
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:31,701
Like what? What other options?

407
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:34,820
- If you guys are gonna fight...
- Shut it!

408
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,780
Just sit down and eat your dinner.

409
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,001
Other options. There's lots of options.

410
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,379
- Such as?
- One could be a leave of absence.

411
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:45,508
- A leave of absence from my job.
- I'm not gonna get in a fight

412
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:47,131
about this with you right now.

413
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,693
You don't have to,
'cause you could sit there in judgment

414
00:21:49,853 --> 00:21:52,319
and you'll never
be threatened to have to leave your job

415
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,211
which you love and have worked
so hard for

416
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:57,872
to stay home and take care of the baby.
I hear what you're saying.

417
00:21:58,756 --> 00:22:01,689
- Can you pass the corn?
- Sure, honey. Here's the corn.

418
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:09,197
- I got it!
- I'll get it.

419
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:12,658
Or she can get it.

420
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,849
- Hi, Buddy.
- Tami, how are you?

421
00:22:17,757 --> 00:22:18,881
- Come on in
- OK.

422
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,985
Buddy's here. He's got a box.

423
00:22:22,204 --> 00:22:24,170
Oh, y'all are eating. Is it a bad time?

424
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:26,087
No, it's fine. Come on in.

425
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:29,240
- How you doing, Buddy?
- Good.

426
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,824
Let me get another plate.

427
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:33,250
- Whatcha got there?
- That's all right,

428
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:37,269
- Make yourself comfortable.
- I just came by because I'm...

429
00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:40,394
I took all this stuff
out of the apartment.

430
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:44,372
This is my prized possessions.
I got my Babe Ruth autographed baseball

431
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:47,902
and my granddad's gold watch
and all this stuff.

432
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:51,447
I came here 'cause you're great parents
and you always know what to.

433
00:22:51,822 --> 00:22:54,033
To tell you the truth
I don't know what to do

434
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:57,067
'cause Santiago's friends
have resurfaced.

435
00:22:57,227 --> 00:23:00,228
His old friends, and they're like...
I don't want to be judgmental

436
00:23:00,388 --> 00:23:02,583
and I don't want to be prejudiced,

437
00:23:02,983 --> 00:23:04,915
but these guys are, like...

438
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:07,835
They're thugs. And I don't know

439
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:10,758
if I should leave this stuff
in the house 'cause I invited 'em over.

440
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,269
It's his house too.
His friends should come over.

441
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:15,767
If he sees me take all these out...

442
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:19,721
So maybe I ought to just
put 'em back in there.

443
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:42,013
OK, you know what?
I'm getting real sick of this.

444
00:23:42,691 --> 00:23:44,375
Sorry I don't feel like talking to you.

445
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:47,109
You're gonna have
to talk to me eventually.

446
00:23:50,704 --> 00:23:51,704
Mom,

447
00:23:53,312 --> 00:23:55,841
What you and Noelle's parents
did at that dinner

448
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,432
was completely stupid,
and humiliating.

449
00:23:59,694 --> 00:24:00,696
Stupid?

450
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,978
Well, excuse me,
but I have a right to my own opinion.

451
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,605
- Not when it's messing with my life.
- You don't get it.

452
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:09,132
Maybe you're the one
that doesn't get it.

453
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:27,251
What are you doing?

454
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,047
I'm getting ready.
I'm going to a quincenera.

455
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:33,070
You look beautiful.

456
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:34,939
Thank you.

457
00:24:37,486 --> 00:24:40,381
- What is a quincenera?
- It's...

458
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:43,665
It's a birthday party
for a 15-year-old girl,

459
00:24:44,614 --> 00:24:45,811
like sweet 16.

460
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:49,523
The whole family goes. It's fun.

461
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:51,412
All right.

462
00:24:53,704 --> 00:24:55,237
Well, have fun then.

463
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:01,369
- Why don't you come with me?
- Yeah?

464
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:03,286
Yeah.

465
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:05,938
Let me...

466
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,129
Let me just go change.

467
00:25:13,656 --> 00:25:15,017
Who are all they?

468
00:25:15,177 --> 00:25:17,468
It's her family

469
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,095
They're supporting her.

470
00:25:19,993 --> 00:25:22,431
Wanna dance? Come on!

471
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:24,653
- It's a waltz.
- All right, but...

472
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:26,477
Okay. So,

473
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:28,312
Put your hand my back like this.

474
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:30,017
So I can rest my hand.

475
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:31,619
It's like an arm rest.

476
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:33,764
One, two, three. One, two, three.

477
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:01,679
I don't want you to leave.

478
00:26:05,338 --> 00:26:06,792
I love you and...

479
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:08,894
you love me

480
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:11,141
so I don't understand
why you'd be leaving.

481
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:13,774
- It doesn't make any sense.
- I can't stay, Matt.

482
00:26:14,036 --> 00:26:15,252
I know, I know.

483
00:26:15,915 --> 00:26:17,004
This...

484
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:19,408
I know it sounds dumb
'cause I'm only 17.

485
00:26:19,568 --> 00:26:20,984
No, it's not that.

486
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:25,244
I wish what you said was possible.

487
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,418
My family...

488
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:29,731
My family needs me.

489
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:33,033
I have to be there for them.

490
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:34,943
I'm sorry.

491
00:26:59,248 --> 00:27:01,614
Brian, the movie starts in 20 minutes.

492
00:27:01,876 --> 00:27:03,947
There's gonna be
a half hour of previews.

493
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:07,960
All right, y'all enjoy the movie.
And come home right afterwards.

494
00:27:08,678 --> 00:27:10,275
- Thank you.
- There you go.

495
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:13,375
thank you for taking your little sister
to the movies.

496
00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:14,668
You're welcome.

497
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:19,882
Boy, boy, boy.

498
00:27:45,877 --> 00:27:47,267
Looks good, huh?

499
00:27:49,828 --> 00:27:52,373
Maybe I should go get some stuff
for when they come over.

500
00:27:52,635 --> 00:27:54,124
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

501
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,503
Here, let me give you some money.
Get whatever you need,

502
00:27:57,765 --> 00:27:59,590
- Thank you.
- You bet.

503
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:17,031
- Here.
- Thank you.

504
00:28:19,494 --> 00:28:20,494
Cheers...

505
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,360
Let's talk.

506
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:46,428
I think I forgot...

507
00:28:46,984 --> 00:28:48,388
I think I forgot...

508
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:51,280
what this new motherhood...

509
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,182
does to your life.

510
00:28:54,342 --> 00:28:56,855
How much it just turns
everything upside down.

511
00:28:57,294 --> 00:28:59,641
And I really thought
to be able to do it, you know?

512
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:01,566
I could do the job
and I could...

513
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:06,021
raise Gracie and take care of you
and take care of Jules and...

514
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,905
But I don't think...
I don't think I can do it, you know?

515
00:29:15,065 --> 00:29:17,726
I do think I'm gonna have
to let the job go.

516
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:24,536
I've to tell y'all...
something.

517
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,676
You're not gonna quit your job,
so get all that out of your head.

518
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:32,676
One of the reasons that you and I
gave up that job down at TMU

519
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:34,767
is so that you didn't have
to give up your job.

520
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:37,937
You're a damn good mother,
a damn good counselor.

521
00:29:38,198 --> 00:29:39,689
And you're a hell of a hot wife.

522
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:43,718
I was just inside on the computer.
You know what I found out?

523
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:47,280
I found out that separation
anxiety is completely normal.

524
00:29:48,032 --> 00:29:49,185
We get over it.

525
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:52,095
I also found out
that certain studies suggest

526
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:55,663
that children who go to daycare,
actually, it helps them socialize.

527
00:29:55,956 --> 00:29:58,973
If, in years to come,
it turns out the daycare screwed her up,

528
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,668
she's always got you for counseling.

529
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:03,873
You're funny.

530
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:06,353
Stick together.
It all works out.

531
00:30:08,982 --> 00:30:10,127
C'me here.

532
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:18,132
- Hi.
- Hi.

533
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:20,034
Why we come all the way
to this theater?

534
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:21,648
Two popcorns,
three drinks.

535
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:24,454
Three drinks?

536
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,123
Why...

537
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,075
Smash, hey.

538
00:30:28,377 --> 00:30:29,377
Hey.

539
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:33,159
- What did you tell your parents?
- Late practice. You?

540
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,874
- That's my little excuse right here.
- Hey, Noannie.

541
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,034
Hi.

542
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,754
There you go.

543
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:40,136
Thank you.

544
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:43,237
Maybe we should go find our seats.

545
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:32,968
Back up! Back it up!
Back up, homie, all right!

546
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:38,015
Everybody, drink!
Have fun!

547
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:01,099
Hey, little mama.

548
00:32:02,102 --> 00:32:03,924
What you're doing here
all by yourself?

549
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:06,427
My brother's
right over there.

550
00:32:12,154 --> 00:32:13,304
Knock it off.

551
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,420
Black on white
actually run in the family?

552
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,396
'cause if it does,
I could help you out with that.

553
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:27,645
Jerk.

554
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,785
All right, hold this up, baby.

555
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:39,869
I said knock it off.

556
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,706
- I'm not doing anything.
- You leave my sister alone.

557
00:32:43,966 --> 00:32:46,062
You're the one
that left your sister alone.

558
00:32:46,657 --> 00:32:50,295
Besides, you got one of ours.
Why shouldn't we get one of yours?

559
00:32:56,437 --> 00:32:59,054
Come on, get up! Get up!
Come on, come on, go!

560
00:32:59,939 --> 00:33:00,806
He hit me!

561
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,033
I didn't do anything to him!

562
00:33:10,451 --> 00:33:12,722
You okay, you okay?
You all right?

563
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:15,113
Okay, just go right home
and I'll call you, okay?

564
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:16,822
Come on, let's go.

565
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:44,601
- Give me the watch back, Devon.
- What watch?

566
00:33:44,872 --> 00:33:46,644
No, don't play stupid with me, Devon!

567
00:33:47,074 --> 00:33:49,396
I know you got that watch
in that house, homie.

568
00:33:49,556 --> 00:33:50,940
I don't got no watch, man.

569
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,882
Don't be an ass.
Give me the watch back!

570
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:55,132
Oh, I'm being an ass?
Okay, okay.

571
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:57,571
I'm not the one
who's sucking up to some bastard

572
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,365
who's paying my way for everything.

573
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:00,843
He's just helping...

574
00:34:01,003 --> 00:34:02,744
When did you forget
where you came from?

575
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,633
He's helping you out?
Good, congratulations!

576
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,332
Your fat fairy godmother showed up.

577
00:34:07,593 --> 00:34:08,583
Hooray!

578
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,668
Sandman.
Football star.

579
00:34:12,994 --> 00:34:14,671
It's not my fault
I got a break, Devon.

580
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,717
All right? It's supposed to be my fault
'cause I got a chance?

581
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:19,259
Screw you.

582
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:24,096
Do you think that guy
would give a damn about you

583
00:34:24,256 --> 00:34:26,100
if you weren't playing football
for his team?

584
00:34:31,063 --> 00:34:32,941
- I don't know.
- He doesn't care about you.

585
00:34:33,202 --> 00:34:36,110
He just wants something from you
and as soon as he gets it, he's gone.

586
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:38,534
Now get the hell out my hood, man.

587
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:47,165
Not without that watch.

588
00:35:22,817 --> 00:35:23,615
I'm sorry.

589
00:35:23,877 --> 00:35:25,868
- You shouldn't have even left me.
- I know.

590
00:35:26,129 --> 00:35:28,536
I'm sorry, it's my fault.
Look, look...

591
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:30,966
- Just don't tell mom.
- What? No!

592
00:35:31,126 --> 00:35:33,334
Please, please, for me.
Don't tell mom.

593
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:36,650
You shouldn't have left me!

594
00:35:38,824 --> 00:35:40,726
You shouldn't have left me!

595
00:35:48,176 --> 00:35:50,351
You are on the air with Lyla Garrity.

596
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:51,978
<i>This is Rita from Larribee.</i>

597
00:35:52,238 --> 00:35:54,702
<i>When I pray at school
and I'm not bothering anyone else,</i>

598
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:57,042
<i>I just bow my head
and put my hands together.</i>

599
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:58,441
<i>People make fun of me,</i>

600
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:00,485
<i>and it's really hard.
Makes me feel stupid</i>

601
00:36:00,747 --> 00:36:03,155
<i>and I don't want to.
What should I do?</i>

602
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,949
<i>People are gonna make fun at school</i>

603
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:08,452
for whatever
they can get their hands on.

604
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:10,971
<i>But most importantly,</i>

605
00:36:12,063 --> 00:36:13,833
you gotta be true to who you are.

606
00:36:15,118 --> 00:36:16,568
<i>There's a gospel son,</i>

607
00:36:17,264 --> 00:36:19,380
"This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine."

608
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,216
<i>And it doesn't just pertain
to spreading the word.</i>

609
00:36:22,476 --> 00:36:23,718
It pertains to you.

610
00:36:23,997 --> 00:36:26,595
<i>To the truth that lives inside you.</i>

611
00:36:27,242 --> 00:36:28,890
Don't hide that from the world.

612
00:36:29,597 --> 00:36:31,600
<i>Tell the world how you feel.</i>

613
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:33,770
Let your light shine.

614
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:38,441
<i>Thanks for calling in, Rita.
We're going to James.</i>

615
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:42,566
Damn it, Lyla.

616
00:37:12,134 --> 00:37:14,227
- How are you doin'?
- Who are they for?

617
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:17,437
A girl.

618
00:37:34,491 --> 00:37:35,349
Hello?

619
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,000
Matthew, honey?

620
00:38:07,128 --> 00:38:08,964
She had to leave a day early.

621
00:38:10,068 --> 00:38:12,242
She really wanted
to tell you goodbye.

622
00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:17,288
It's too bad.
She was...

623
00:38:17,578 --> 00:38:18,749
She was a nice girl.

624
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:20,010
Yeah...

625
00:38:21,177 --> 00:38:22,527
Good night, honey.

626
00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:44,530
All right, well...

627
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,194
Great job. I can't believe
how fast you picked that up.

628
00:38:47,669 --> 00:38:49,697
Yeah, well, I have
a really good teacher.

629
00:38:50,316 --> 00:38:51,316
Thank you.

630
00:39:05,163 --> 00:39:07,301
Put this on the right way before you.

631
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:10,098
Okay, that's...

632
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:12,214
Okay.
All right.

633
00:39:12,772 --> 00:39:15,305
- * blast.
- Yeah, me too.

634
00:39:25,306 --> 00:39:26,776
Should we be letting go now?

635
00:39:57,576 --> 00:39:59,140
All right, let me *wamk* you out.

636
00:40:19,171 --> 00:40:20,620
God Almighty!

637
00:40:21,454 --> 00:40:22,978
What happened to you, son?

638
00:40:27,062 --> 00:40:29,755
I had to...
I had to get back your watch.

639
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:37,728
Come on.

640
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:40,141
Let's go get you cleaned up.

641
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:43,018
Come on, buddy.
You'll be all right.

642
00:40:44,266 --> 00:40:46,104
- How was the movie?
- Yeah, how was it?

643
00:40:46,701 --> 00:40:47,732
It was good.

644
00:40:50,008 --> 00:40:51,010
I liked it.

645
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,701
Y'all didn't say nothing about it
when you came home.

646
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:55,280
You sure are quiet this morning.

647
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:12,464
- Hi, there.
- Hi, how are you?

648
00:41:12,726 --> 00:41:14,132
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

649
00:41:14,394 --> 00:41:16,676
- I think we're ready.
- Great, good.

650
00:41:16,937 --> 00:41:19,764
- Oh, this is my husband Eric.
- How do you do? Nice to meet you.

651
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:22,948
Okay, so how's Gracie?

652
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:24,768
She's great.

653
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:28,314
- So you ready?
- Yeah, she's ready.

654
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:32,765
Love you Gracie.

655
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:35,820
We're gonna take good care of her.

656
00:41:36,562 --> 00:41:39,199
Yes, she's a cutie.
Hi, sweet heart.

657
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:42,285
Yeah, she's gonna do great.

658
00:41:43,964 --> 00:41:46,539
Here... Here's her bag.
There's everything in there.

659
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:49,042
See you later, kid.

660
00:41:49,863 --> 00:41:51,207
Bye.
You have a good day.

661
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:52,367
Bye, honey.

662
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:54,472
Love you.

663
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:56,300
Oh, here's Mr. Noodles.

664
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,272
Oh, we've got Mr. Noodles too.

665
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,771
Okay, bye.

666
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:01,181
Have a good one.

667
00:42:06,646 --> 00:42:08,911
She didn't even turn around
and look at me.

668
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:11,614
I think she's totally over me.

669
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,113
- You have to pull that up.
- I know how...

670
00:42:17,273 --> 00:42:18,523
Well, I didn't.
