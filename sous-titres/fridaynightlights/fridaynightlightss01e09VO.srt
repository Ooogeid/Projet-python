1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,509
Is something happening
between you and Riggins?

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,000
No!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,500
You're gonna steal a cripple's girl,
but you won't fight a cripple?

4
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:13,276
You're a coward, Riggins!
Always will be.

5
00:00:13,342 --> 00:00:14,810
I would like to tell
both of you

6
00:00:14,843 --> 00:00:16,509
that I'm going on a date
with Matt Saracen.

7
00:00:16,543 --> 00:00:20,175
Boys think about sex
every single minute of the day.

8
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:22,300
You're sweet, and I don't want
to see you get hurt.

9
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:23,709
I love you too, Dad.

10
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:25,000
All right, how much?

11
00:00:25,043 --> 00:00:26,702
- $300.
- A month?

12
00:00:26,787 --> 00:00:27,702
Try a week.

13
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:28,919
All right,
can I pay you next week?

14
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:30,401
You're good for it.

15
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:32,503
He's gonna need a little
financial assistance,

16
00:00:32,576 --> 00:00:34,901
'cause of the exams
that he's gonna have to take.

17
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:38,102
Let's show him how much
we love him

18
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,403
and we want him
to make us all proud.

19
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:42,401
Amen.

20
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:24,701
Romans 2:16 tells us,

21
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:26,470
"The day will surely come

22
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:30,301
when God will judge
all of our secret lives."

23
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:35,443
If we turn away from God,
and begin to worship

24
00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:38,570
foreign Gods,
God will surely know.

25
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:41,341
You know how He will know it?

26
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:45,103
Hebrews 4:12 tells us
that God will discern

27
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,800
the thoughts and the intents
of our hearts.

28
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,871
Amen, amen.

29
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:52,802
There are secret things
that belongs to God,

30
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:55,902
but the revealed things
belongs to us.

31
00:01:57,606 --> 00:02:01,703
Brother Brian, our prayers
are with you this Friday.

32
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:04,522
We are praying that God
will give you the strength

33
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:07,600
to run all over Gatling
this Friday.

34
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:11,812
Amen.

35
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:17,902
<i>* My worship is for real
Say thank you, Jesus  *</i>

36
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:29,700
Hey there, Lyla.

37
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:31,703
Hi.

38
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:05,073
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:06,706 --> 00:03:09,740
There are no words
that could ever express that,

40
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:12,773
but I am so sorry.

41
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:22,042
Please.

42
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:23,803
Did you have sex with him?

43
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:29,700
- How many times?
- Jason, please--

44
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:31,701
Oh, come on. How many?

45
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:35,671
You can go.

00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:18,501

<i>This is Slammin' Sammy Meade
talkin' Panther football--</i>

51
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:55,703
<i>we got a caller on the line.
Chuck, whattya know?</i>

52
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:57,000
<i>Hey, Sammy.</i>

53
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:59,302
<i>I got a bad feeling
about this game Friday night.</i>

54
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:01,902
<i>I mean, Gatling looks mighty hard.</i>

55
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:05,002
<i>Road games are never good,
but heading over there to Gatling</i>

56
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:07,501
<i>is like going to another planet.
You know what I'm saying..</i>

57
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,653
<i>I do, I do.</i>

58
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:11,803
<i>I mean, it's inner-city.
It's tough. It's the hood.</i>

59
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:14,403
<i>And that Junior Silverio
makes their defense brutal..</i>

60
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:17,401
<i>That's Silverio, and I'll tell you what,
they don't call that defense</i>

61
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:19,903
<i>the Black Hole of Gatling
for their good looks.</i>

62
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:22,600
<i>But we do have an interesting situation
with Smash Williams.</i>

63
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:25,503
<i>Now, Gatling is his hometown.
It's where he grew up.</i>

64
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:29,003
<i>And he's going against
his childhood rival, Junior Silverio.</i>

65
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:31,703
<i>Yeah, yeah, that Junior isn't
a middle linebacker, though.</i>

66
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:32,993
<i>He's your worst nightmare.</i>

67
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:35,402
Hey, Brian!
Get those cleats off my table.

68
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,122
Where's your mind at, boy?

69
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:39,321
They're talking about Junior
like he's the Second Coming.

70
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:40,702
He ain't got nothing on me.

71
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,303
Well, you just let 'em talk.
You do your talk on the field.

72
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:45,801
Hey, Ma, are we spending
the night in Gatling?

73
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:47,603
I want to see if Jennifer
and Nicole still live there.

74
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:49,500
Yeah, Mama, can we go
and see the old house?

75
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:52,802
We are not going to fool around.
We're going to watch your brother play.

76
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:54,501
Can we go see Dad?

77
00:05:57,508 --> 00:05:59,400
We're not going to no cemetery.

78
00:05:59,507 --> 00:06:02,000
We  moved away from there for a reason.
Now y'all hurry up.

79
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:04,500
You make me late again,
you're gonna be walking to school.

80
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:06,351
- Almost ready for school?
- Mm-hmm.

81
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:08,402
She's on the phone right now
with Matt Saracen.

82
00:06:08,505 --> 00:06:12,102
- I don't think this thing's going away.
- I have not even had my coffee yet.

83
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:13,653
- Well, I'm just saying--
- Don't want to talk about this--

84
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:15,201
It's becoming a thing.
I mean, it's a thing.

85
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:17,201
And you know what thing it is?
It's that thing

86
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:19,903
that we always knew was gonna happen
to our little girl.

87
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:22,203
It's that thing--
that thing is happening now.

88
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:26,600
Well, at least she's not interested
in a serial killer, or-- or one of the Riggins.

89
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:28,223
I've got the keys.
Come on, honey, let's go.

90
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:30,122
All right, let's go, let's go.

91
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:42,850
No, get off me!

92
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:44,590
I know, I know.

93
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:48,100
Hey, Saracen. Whatcha gonna do
about Riggins, man?

94
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:49,801
What do you want me to do?

95
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:51,792
The dude tried to beat up
a guy in a wheelchair.

96
00:06:51,906 --> 00:06:53,401
That's as low as it gets.

97
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:54,720
I thought you were captain.

98
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:57,301
Captains are supposed
to be leaders. Step on him.

99
00:06:57,406 --> 00:07:00,300
All right, man?
Let's do something about this.

100
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:39,153
Hi, Lyla.

101
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:41,251
Garrity?

102
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:45,053
Garrity?

103
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,520
Yo, Garrity, just hold up.

104
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:52,001
- Hi, Tyra.
- So I heard...

105
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,702
- What'd you hear?
- Jason punched out Tim.

106
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:56,850
Oh, right.

107
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:59,502
Yeah, yeah.
I heard you were there.

108
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:01,503
Yeah, I was.

109
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:03,503
So why'd he do it?

110
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:05,800
I don't know.

111
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:08,601
Maybe just a misunderstanding.
You know guys.

112
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:10,603
Oh, yeah, misunderstandings.
That's funny.

113
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:13,202
The rumors are flying,
just so you're aware.

114
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:15,103
Yeah, well,
I'm sure they're not true.

115
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:18,001
Right, well, I didn't even
tell you what they were.

116
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:24,113
You know, I know you and Tim have been
spending a lot of time together.

117
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:28,501
I got a--
I got ethics class, so I gotta go.

118
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,223
Right.

119
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:37,701
I was wondering if you could
give me a little help

120
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:40,800
- on this hotel situation.
- What hotel situation, Mayor?

121
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:43,003
For this Friday night.

122
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,503
Gatling isn't exactly... 
rolling out the welcome wagon.

123
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:50,000
Seems they want to put us up
in the Cheyenne Motel.

124
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:52,000
At the risk of sounding like a snob,

125
00:08:52,107 --> 00:08:54,803
I don't want to get shot in a
drive-by this weekend, is all.

126
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:56,702
Call me crazy.

127
00:08:56,757 --> 00:08:59,803
I don't think there's any worry
of that though.

128
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:01,100
That's  not necessary.

129
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,003
Anyway, there's a meeting set up
tomorrow night,

130
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:04,203
to work this whole thing through.

131
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:06,503
Problem is, I've got a prior commitment.

132
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:09,003
Left  solely in Buddy Garrity's hands,

133
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:11,502
this whole thing
could spin way out of control.

134
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:15,601
Buddy can be a tad abrasive when I'm not there
to be the yin to his yang, as it were.

135
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:17,891
Tami.

136
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:22,200
Tami, you are the perfect person
for this job.

137
00:09:21,398 --> 00:09:23,400
- Oh, come--
- What do you say?

138
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:26,103
You want me to be
Buddy Garrity's yang?

139
00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:27,402
Yin, actually.

140
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:28,621
- Well, I don't--
- No, you would be wonderful.

141
00:09:28,696 --> 00:09:29,721
You'd be wonderful.

142
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:31,202
Oh, well, I don't think I--

143
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,500
- You know, that--
- Oh, thank you so much!

144
00:09:33,693 --> 00:09:35,502
I'll see you all Friday night, right?

145
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:36,302
Oh, well then--

146
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:39,909
Oh, Tami... wear something pretty.
And, you know... And, uh...

147
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:42,450
You'll have 'em
eating out of your hand.

148
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, all right, well,
I'll, um... That's...

149
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:47,700
Babe, got things to do.

150
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:51,700
Honey... A yin and a--
I don't understand what I'm even doing, honey!

151
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:54,400
Can I just say that you're choosing
to date a football player?

152
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:57,203
- Like, voluntarily?
- He's Matt.

153
00:09:57,307 --> 00:10:00,801
- He's not a football player.
- He's starting quarterback.

154
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:04,803
But, I mean, he doesn't buy into
the whole jock thing.

155
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,302
He's normal. Relatively.

156
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:09,501
Yeah, well, we'll see
how long that lasts.

157
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:10,801
You are so jaded.

158
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:13,701
People change. Fast.

159
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:16,652
Especially when they're on the team.

160
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:19,902
You know, you gotta
make a change, my friend.

161
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:21,400
This is extremely important.

162
00:10:21,508 --> 00:10:23,123
This isn't just a first date, this...

163
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,803
This is your--
your pre-release party.

164
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:29,602
- My what?
- We're on the brink here.

165
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,700
I mean, Dillon is
a .500 team right now,

166
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:33,300
but you beat Gatling this Friday--

167
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:36,702
which, good luck with that, by the way--
and then you're a winning team again,

168
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:38,400
which is just instant rock star status.

169
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:40,803
All--all these things
are older than we are.

170
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,602
Well, it's called retro,
and the chicks dig it, trust me.

171
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:45,301
Oh, I forgot you're such
an expert about that.

172
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:47,403
Your last girlfriend was what,

173
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:50,132
Jenny Emil?
That was like fifth grade or something?

174
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:53,600
I mean, that's fine. If you wanna get personal,
I mean, you know, that still hurts.

175
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,801
And it was, you know, it was a bad breakup.
So thank you for bringing that back up.

176
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,032
- I appreciate that.
- Sorry.

177
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,162
That's fine, I mean,
I'm just trying

178
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,530
to help you out,
and you wanna get all personal.

179
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:03,603
All right, well then, let's get back
to helping me out and stop this heart-to-heart.

180
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:05,603
- No, no, no!
- What's wrong with these?

181
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:07,761
This is something
that Matt Saracen would wear.

182
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:09,801
Julie Taylor's about to go
on her first date

183
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,801
with a football player.

184
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,000
She doesn't want the man,
she wants the myth.

185
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:16,500
So you gotta pull out
your big guns here, buddy.

186
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:19,230
Now tell me, can you say...

187
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:22,101
"Members Only"?

188
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:28,062
Junior Silverio is the key
to the Gatling defense.

189
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:31,733
We shut him down,
we shut down this team.

190
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:33,503
Pudnick, get you up here.

191
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:40,332
This is him right here.
And it would be him too.

192
00:11:40,436 --> 00:11:44,100
If he was bigger, stronger, and could
actually tackle, it would be him.

193
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:46,701
Now look, we're not gonna
run from this guy.

194
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:51,503
We are gonna go through this bump.
We're gonna punch a hole  right through the heart

195
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:53,161
of this Eagles defense, you understand?

196
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:56,102
- Yes, sir!
- It is going to be a war.

197
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,701
And we're gonna make a statement
that's gonna lead us all the way to State!

198
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:01,100
- Yes, sir!
- Bring it in.

199
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,732
Let's go, let's go!

200
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:08,232
One, two, three!

201
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:09,933
Panthers!

202
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:12,001
- What's up, Street?
- What's up, fellas?

203
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:13,560
Me and the guys wanted to come by.

204
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:14,700
- How are you, man?
- Oh, yeah.

205
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:16,201
How you doing?

206
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,401
Ain't y'all supposed to be
getting ready for Gatling this week?

207
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,301
Yeah, man.

208
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:21,503
Been getting Saracen
killed back there, I hear.

209
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:23,762
You got my message, man?

210
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:25,731
Yeah, yeah.
I got your message.

211
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:29,100
If there's one thing we don't allow,
it's for somebody to hit our quarterback.

212
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,600
Riggins didn't hit me.
I hit him.

213
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:33,702
And I am fine. So...

214
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:35,733
Don't make anything of it, all right?

215
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:38,532
Where did all the pictures
on the wall go, man?

216
00:12:38,806 --> 00:12:40,860
Just, uh...I been here
for a while, man.

217
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:43,532
You know, just wanted
to change things up, you know?

218
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:46,302
The nurse outside told us
that we're your first visitors today.

219
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:48,802
Where's Lyla?
She just not around, or what?

220
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:51,500
- Busy.
- Yeah?

221
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:57,530
Riggins  and Lyla?

222
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:04,300
You know me and the guys
always got your back.

223
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:06,733
We're gonna take care of this, man.

224
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:14,203
Look, i'm just asking you to watch 
her for a couple hours, okay?

225
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:15,872
I'll give you Julie's number.

226
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:18,040
It's just...
she doesn't like...

227
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:20,201
the idea of being alone
at night, so...

228
00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:21,671
You know, I'm--
I'm really thrilled

229
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:24,403
about the idea of being left alone
with your grandmother at night.

230
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:26,203
You know how I feel
about the whole situation.

231
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:27,801
Landry, my grandma
is not a witch.

232
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,271
Okay? She's just not.

233
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,470
Hey, Matt.

234
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:34,140
Come here.
Hey, Lance, how you doin'?

235
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:35,402
Uh, it's--it's Landry.

236
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,502
- Huh? Yeah.
- It's Landry.

237
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:38,041
Listen, can I talk to you for a second?

238
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:39,400
Uh, yeah.

239
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:41,771
What's--what's up, Coach?

240
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:43,401
Big date night tonight?

241
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:45,543
Oh, yeah, but, uh...

242
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,400
I'm gonna have her home early,
right after the movie.

243
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,301
Oh, I know you will.
I know you will.

244
00:13:49,308 --> 00:13:50,602
What's going on with Riggins?

245
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,473
Uh...what do you mean?

246
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:54,203
What I mean is, I have eyes.

247
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:55,773
I wanna know what's going on out there.

248
00:13:55,908 --> 00:14:00,001
You--all due respect, sir, I just don't really
feel it's my place to say anything,

249
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:02,873
so I'm gonna--
I'm--I'm not going to.

250
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:05,401
You know what, I appreciate
your allegiance to your teammates,

251
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:07,000
but you're also team captain.

252
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:10,303
So if there's somethin' going on out there
that's gonna affect his game Friday night,

253
00:14:10,345 --> 00:14:11,901
I suggest that you tell me.

254
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:15,003
- Well, it's-- it's just a rumor.
- What kind of rumor?

255
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:18,071
Somethin' about somebody
he hooked up with. Or--maybe.

256
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,103
- Someone he hooked up with?
- And I don't even think it's true,

257
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:24,102
- so that's why I don't really want--
- Who is it?

258
00:14:24,348 --> 00:14:25,600
Spit it out.

259
00:14:25,646 --> 00:14:27,700
Doesn't need to be anything
between us, spit it out.

260
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:29,472
With Lyla.

261
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:31,300
Lyla Garrity?

262
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:34,003
Yeah.

263
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:36,070
All right. 

264
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,703
- Can I go now?
- Yeah, have a good time at the movies.

265
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:40,670
Hey--my daughter and I talk a lot.

266
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:42,401
Okay.

267
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,342
Hey, Jordanna called.

268
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:50,400
They invited us to a barbeque tomorrow,
when we get to Gatling.

269
00:14:50,477 --> 00:14:51,800
Hold up.

270
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:53,671
You're gonna put Brian
and Junior in the same room?

271
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,840
Look, they may be enemies
on the field,

272
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,902
but  off the field, the Silverios
are still some of our best friends.

273
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:00,802
Huh, well, why'd you
move us away from them?

274
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:03,902
- Because Dillon is safer, that's why.
- Yeah, and whiter, too.

275
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,773
You move us to Dillon to get us
out of the ghetto?

276
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,000
Or to get us away from Dad?

277
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,200
You don't know
what you're talking about.

278
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:16,801
No, I really want to bring it up.

279
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:18,402
Like, we--we should
talk about this.

280
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:20,170
You need to shut your mouth.

281
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:22,400
- Mama, I'm serious--
- Take your smart mouth

282
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,501
and your plate and get away
from my table.

283
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:28,302
You don't talk to me like that.

284
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:36,340
- Hey.
- Evening, Coach.

285
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:37,301
Wait, wait, wait.

286
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,802
Is that a Members Only jacket?

287
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:43,100
Uh...yeah, what-- what do you think?
You think it's okay?

288
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:44,800
Hey, Matt. How are you? Come on in.

289
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:46,002
I'm fine.
How are you doing, ma'am?

290
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,701
- Great. You look nice.
- Well, thank you.

291
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:51,101
Um...is--is Julie here?
Is she ready?

292
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:52,201
Hey, Matt.

293
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:53,341
Hi--hi.

294
00:15:53,378 --> 00:15:55,403
- Uh-uh.
- All right. Um, you know what?

295
00:15:55,577 --> 00:15:57,403
- You look really nice.
- Thanks.

296
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:58,940
Let me just have
a quick word with little Jules.

297
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,941
Why don't y'all go wait
in the living room?

298
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:04,402
And, um... We'll just be a--
just a sec, okay?

299
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:05,371
All right.

300
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:07,141
Just come on, just for one second.

301
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:09,673
Why don't you take
your Members Only jacket off

302
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:11,570
- and hang it on the coat rack?
- Sorry, what?

303
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:13,003
Hang your jacket up, Matt.

304
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,373
Oh, yeah.

305
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:17,800
This is not actually what
you're gonna wear on your date.

306
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:20,400
But this is what people wear on dates.
Not that other dress.

307
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:22,701
I know, but baby, this is not
what you wear on dates.

308
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:26,202
And you can't even walk
in those shoes. Come on.

309
00:16:26,505 --> 00:16:27,973
I love you. Come on.

310
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:29,442
You want a beer?

311
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:31,471
Uh, no thanks. I'm driving.

312
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:32,900
I was joking.

313
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:36,803
So, um, have you heard
good things about the movie?

314
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:39,203
Oh, yeah, one of my people
recommended it, so...

315
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:41,403
You mean Landry?

316
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:43,371
Yeah.

317
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:46,442
Uh, can I get-- Can I just get two
for Eragon, please?

318
00:16:46,478 --> 00:16:48,303
I'm sorry, sir. Eragon is sold out.

319
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,071
Oh, I'm Matt Saracen.

320
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:54,470
QB1?

321
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:57,670
Quarterback?

322
00:16:57,705 --> 00:16:59,002
And...?

323
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:02,303
And I thought that you
held tickets for football players.

324
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:05,701
Not since Reyes started a fight in the balcony.
It took three security guards

325
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:09,203
- to break that one up.
- Yeah, but he's not on the team anymore, so it's--

326
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:10,470
- it's okay.
- Hello?

327
00:17:10,508 --> 00:17:12,140
You can give me those tickets.

328
00:17:12,175 --> 00:17:14,543
Uh...yeah.

329
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,141
Yeah, yeah, just a second.

330
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:20,001
Matt, it's, um-- Your people is calling.

331
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:23,003
Huh? Hello?

332
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,500
Whoa, I told you, if anything goes wrong,
just turn on the Discovery Channel.

333
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:27,942
She'll be all right.

334
00:17:27,975 --> 00:17:29,541
Okay, okay.

335
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:31,400
All right, all right.
I'll be right there.

336
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:33,903
Um, we gotta go back to my house.

337
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:39,800
Look, um, I'm really sorry
that we had to come back here, it's just--

338
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,500
- It's only going to take like a second, so I'll--
- Okay, look, look, look,

339
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,072
I-I swear I did not touch her.

340
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:46,171
We were watching TV, and she
just started flipping out.

341
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:47,472
Where is she?

342
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:50,800
She's in the clos--she
locked herself in the closet.

343
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:52,741
- What closet?
- Right over here.

344
00:17:57,105 --> 00:18:00,401
Gr--Grandma?
I'm gonna come in, okay?

345
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:02,300
I'm not gonna let him touch me like that!

346
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:03,673
- I did not touch her--
- I know, it's fine.

347
00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:07,003
Um, Grandma, I'm gonna
have to come in there, okay?

348
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:09,601
I want Joel.
I want Joel.

349
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:11,702
- She's asking for Joel--
- Yeah, it's my grandfather.

350
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:13,600
- Your grandpa's been dead for six years--
- I know, I know that.

351
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:15,143
Joel...

352
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:17,241
I want Joel...

353
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:19,302
I want Joel...

354
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:21,102
Dar--darling?

355
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:25,703
- Are you-- are you in there, darling?
- Joel, is that you?

356
00:18:25,977 --> 00:18:27,741
Oh, it's--it's me.

357
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:31,302
Hey, sweetheart. I'm gonna--
I'm gonna need you to come out of there, okay?

358
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:32,640
Joel.

359
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:37,001
Sing to me. Sing our song.

360
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:44,800
* Mist--Mister Sandman *

361
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:47,600
* Bring me a dream *

362
00:18:47,906 --> 00:18:51,503
* Make her complexion
Like peaches and cream  *

363
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:56,503
* And then I'll know
my lonely nights are over *

364
00:18:56,808 --> 00:18:57,442
* Sandman..

365
00:18:57,477 --> 00:18:58,942
* Sandman..

366
00:18:58,975 --> 00:19:00,801
* I'm all alone *

367
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:04,991
* So please turn on your magic beam *

368
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:08,500
* Sandman, bring me a dream *

369
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:10,003
* Bum bum bum bum bum bum *

370
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:12,343
* Mister Sandman *

371
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:15,070
* Bring me a dream * 

372
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:20,703
* Make her the sweetest
That I've ever seen *

373
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:21,972
That's--
that's our song.

374
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,801
Oh, that's how we do it.

375
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:25,040
Oh, Joel.

376
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:28,003
- Oh, that bed looks good.
- There you go.

377
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:30,301
See you in my dreams, okay?

378
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:33,903
- I love you.
- I love you too.

379
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,503
O kay?

380
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:37,802
Mister Sandman.

381
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:40,401
You better get sweet dreams,
so he can come.

382
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,870
You get some sleep.

383
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:56,240
I'll--I'll just get Landry
to take me home.

384
00:19:56,605 --> 00:19:57,340
Okay.

385
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:15,303
Ly-ly? You in there?

386
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:16,930
Comin' in, precious.

387
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:24,100
Honey...
You didn't come down for breakfast.

388
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:26,233
You're late for school, honey.

389
00:20:28,438 --> 00:20:30,692
Carpe diem.

390
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:33,390
Daddy, I'll be right down, okay?

391
00:20:33,537 --> 00:20:35,033
Okay.

392
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,601
Seems like you got home mighty early
from your date last night.

393
00:20:44,006 --> 00:20:46,400
How was the movie? Was it good or...

394
00:20:46,597 --> 00:20:49,402
You realize we can't talk about
these kind of things, right?

395
00:20:49,496 --> 00:20:51,162
Oh, right sorry. I lost my head.

396
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:52,233
I apologize.

397
00:20:52,905 --> 00:20:54,533
We never went to a movie.

398
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:58,031
And, no, we weren't
parked somewhere or anything.

399
00:20:58,098 --> 00:21:01,201
Matt just got a call,
and he needed to help out his grandma.

400
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:02,732
Sorry about that.

401
00:21:04,065 --> 00:21:06,661
It was...sort of okay.

402
00:21:06,796 --> 00:21:11,402
It was like... the first time
I actually go to see the real Matt Saracen.

403
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:16,132
I totally blew it.

404
00:21:16,196 --> 00:21:18,160
And that stupid jacket didn't help any.

405
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:20,591
Well, Matt, there's no reason
to blame the couture.

406
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:24,500
- Just 'cause you couldn't pull it off.
- I end up singing to my grandma.

407
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,402
Look, all I asked you to do
was watch her for a couple hours--

408
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,603
Okay, listen, Casanova.
You singing to your grandma

409
00:21:29,697 --> 00:21:31,391
was probably the only thing
that you did right.

410
00:21:31,435 --> 00:21:35,101
- Oh, yeah? Why is that?
- Well, I mean, Julie totally bought it.

411
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,991
She told me so on the way home.

412
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:37,993
What'd she say?

413
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:41,700
Well, she said that it was sweet.
And vulnerable.

414
00:21:41,938 --> 00:21:43,332
Sweet and vulnerable?

415
00:21:44,006 --> 00:21:45,130
That's what she said?

416
00:21:47,897 --> 00:21:51,300
Great, sweet and vulnerable is like a kitten,
Landry, not a boyfriend.

417
00:21:51,366 --> 00:21:54,703
Well, calm down, I mean, you gotta--
you gotta take what you got and work with it.

418
00:21:54,808 --> 00:21:57,603
You know, drop the whole quarterback macho thing.

419
00:21:57,705 --> 00:21:59,601
You clearly can't pull that one off.
And, you know,

420
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,130
you use the sensitive, artistic thing.

421
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:03,300
So you think there actually

422
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:06,032
might still be a chance that she's kind of
maybe like, a little bit--

423
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:08,190
Singing to your grandma
may be the one thing

424
00:22:08,238 --> 00:22:10,393
that gets you into Julie Taylor's funhouse.

425
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:11,293
What?

426
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:13,363
Don't tell me you haven't
thought about that.

427
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,062
That's--that-- that's just wrong.

428
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:19,660
We're just gonna have to tell those people

429
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:23,401
that they're gonna have to provide
first class accommodations for us,

430
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,900
just like we gave them
when they came here,

431
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:27,701
and it's as simple as that.
That's what we do.

432
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:31,702
Well, I think, you know, it's gonna be important
not to put them  on the defensive.

433
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:35,303
And I'm not sure that that's gonna be the 
best way for us to get what we want.

434
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:38,200
Oh, Tammy, you know
how these people are.

435
00:22:38,695 --> 00:22:39,691
Oh.

436
00:22:40,306 --> 00:22:42,500
- Well--
- They don't-- they don't like us.

437
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:46,502
But I still think that we might wanna just
give it a little bit of a different approach.

438
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:50,602
Just sort of, you know, tip it on its head
a little bit, if you know what I mean.

439
00:22:50,706 --> 00:22:51,732
I know.

440
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:53,992
I know.

441
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:58,101
I see why my daughter loves you, though.
She speaks so highly of you.

442
00:22:58,235 --> 00:23:00,503
- Aww...she's a sweet girl.
- Yeah.

443
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:04,900
Have you seen anything
lately with her, anything different?

444
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:06,891
She got some big problem or something?

445
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,002
Well, um...

446
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:11,903
She's not eating,
and she just seems... distracted.

447
00:23:12,205 --> 00:23:15,501
You know, I'm thinking maybe it's just that...
teenage girl thing.

448
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:17,002
But I--what do I know?

449
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:22,802
I think, as a parent, best thing you can do
is, uh... just don't try to fix it.

450
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:26,701
Just--just be there for her.
Just let her know you love her.

451
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,363
That's good.

452
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:31,132
You know, you and I
are gonna make a great team.

453
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,801
Because I can tell
you just kill 'em with kindness.

454
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:34,860
Okay.

455
00:23:34,898 --> 00:23:36,902
I'll put a little pressure on 'em,

456
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:39,233
and see if we can squeeze some
nicer digs out of 'em.

457
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:41,501
Oh, okay. All right, then.

458
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:46,202
You need to get the lead out of your
ass before Friday. Come on, let's go.

459
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,060
Push! Don't worry.

460
00:23:51,506 --> 00:23:54,301
I'll be ready for prime time,
just like Dad taught me.

461
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:57,500
Would you shut up about Dad
and stop bringing him up?

462
00:23:57,605 --> 00:23:59,292
Look, we going
to the city where he died.

463
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,562
And I don't know why we're not
allowed to talk about him.

464
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:03,500
- Don't you think that's weird?
- No.

465
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:05,493
Mom might hate him,
but that don't mean I do.

466
00:24:05,536 --> 00:24:06,790
Seven.

467
00:24:06,837 --> 00:24:09,402
I remember the guy who taught me
how to throw a spiral.

468
00:24:09,506 --> 00:24:11,402
- And took us fishing.
- Your point is?

469
00:24:11,506 --> 00:24:14,601
And gave me my nickname after I crashed
my bike into the water heater.

470
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,402
Well, you know what?
I remember other things, Brian.

471
00:24:17,806 --> 00:24:20,203
Don't matter, Sheila.
He was our dad.

472
00:24:20,406 --> 00:24:23,033
I don't see what the big mystery is.

473
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:25,200
The only mystery is how
you can move your mouth so fast,

474
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:27,501
but your legs are moving so slow.
Come on.

475
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:30,302
Brian, let's go.

476
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,161
Oh, my God, Brian!

477
00:24:33,196 --> 00:24:34,530
Breathe, breathe!

478
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:36,831
Breathe.

479
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:41,901
Yeah, clean as a whistle.

480
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:44,500
Yeah, at this point, I'm thinking
it's just anxiety.

481
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:46,201
You been under any stress lately?

482
00:24:46,307 --> 00:24:46,962
Yeah.

483
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:50,002
We got a big game
coming up on Friday.

484
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:51,701
Oh, yeah.
Gatling defense.

485
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:54,702
- Yeah.
- I'd be stressing too.

486
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:57,502
Just get some rest, okay, and you'll be fine.
And take it to 'em, okay?

487
00:24:57,605 --> 00:24:58,500
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

488
00:24:58,706 --> 00:24:59,790
Thanks.

489
00:25:00,507 --> 00:25:02,433
See? No big deal. So just chill.

490
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:04,233
Oh, please don't tell me to chill.

491
00:25:04,406 --> 00:25:06,601
Since when did you start
having anxiety attacks?

492
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:08,900
You know I always
get excited before games.

493
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:12,263
Did your face
always break out too?

494
00:25:12,706 --> 00:25:13,500
Look...

495
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:17,600
You either tell me what's going on,
or Mom's gonna find out.

496
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:19,191
Come on.

497
00:25:19,905 --> 00:25:21,801
Look, it's just some
pick-me-ups I've been taking.

498
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:24,002
I got it from my trainer.
It's all legit.

499
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:24,903
Pick-me-ups?

500
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:27,403
What, from some fake bodybuilder
at some stupid gym?

501
00:25:27,508 --> 00:25:29,903
Look, don't check me on this, all right?
I know what I'm doing.

502
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:31,501
It's just gonna give me a little edge.

503
00:25:31,606 --> 00:25:34,101
Boy, since the time you were 9 years old,
it's been all about you.

504
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,900
You never have to do
anything around the house,

505
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:37,500
- Sheila...
- just so you can practice.

506
00:25:37,606 --> 00:25:39,500
Somebody's gotta step up
and be the man of the house

507
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:40,803
now that Dad's not around.

508
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:43,601
You are gonna get into trouble.
Do you not understand this?

509
00:25:43,706 --> 00:25:47,202
Look, Sheila, let me just--
let me just be clear with you, all right?

510
00:25:47,307 --> 00:25:49,003
Football is my life.

511
00:25:49,406 --> 00:25:51,500
That's all I got in this world.

512
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:53,733
I need your help.

513
00:25:55,306 --> 00:25:56,592
Are we cool?

514
00:25:58,207 --> 00:25:59,791
For now. All right.

515
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:01,370
Hyuh!

516
00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:04,002
- Coach.
- How you doing?

517
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,203
Good.
Better than you.

518
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:08,303
You got Gatling this weekend.

519
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,103
Well, you know what? We're gonna
be patient with the offense.

520
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:13,301
We're gonna take what we can,
is what we're gonna do.

521
00:27:13,505 --> 00:27:15,700
I know you're busy,
but I just wanted to let you know

522
00:27:15,806 --> 00:27:17,201
I played in that scrimmage
the other night.

523
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:19,653
And, uh... think I did pretty well.

524
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,302
I heard you did.
I heard you threw the ball well.

525
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:22,603
And I heard you gave 'em hell.

526
00:27:22,705 --> 00:27:24,501
And I'm sorry I couldn't have been there.

527
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:28,481
Did you, uh...
did you hear anything else?

528
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,580
Yeah.

529
00:27:32,106 --> 00:27:33,301
Yeah, I heard.

530
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:36,752
Sorry I laid your fullback out.

531
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:40,720
You all right?

532
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:45,501
You know, it's just you think you...
you think you know someone.

533
00:27:45,806 --> 00:27:48,050
And then you don't.

534
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:49,603
Just don't.

535
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:51,900
I didn't come here
to talk about that.

536
00:27:52,106 --> 00:27:56,003
But I want you to know that, you know,
you don't have to be alone with it either.

537
00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:58,301
I want you to know that.

538
00:27:58,406 --> 00:28:01,301
Oh, thank you. I understand.

539
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:03,153
I appreciate it.

540
00:28:18,008 --> 00:28:19,982
Anybody but her!

541
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:25,001
Your brother's a jackass.

542
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,501
I hope Lyla was worth it,
little brother. Whoo!

543
00:28:37,706 --> 00:28:40,402
You have the best barbecue
I've ever tasted in Gatling.

544
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:44,600
And I swear, if you ever repeat that
to anybody, I will deny, deny, deny.

545
00:28:44,805 --> 00:28:48,501
But it is-- we don't have anything
that comes close to that in Dillon.

546
00:28:48,628 --> 00:28:50,800
- Oh, we know.
- Oh, I'm sure you do.

547
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:54,400
Ah, Dwight, can you just
quite flirting with the coach's wife.

548
00:28:54,605 --> 00:28:57,203
Unless you're getting down
to business right here, all right?

549
00:28:57,305 --> 00:29:01,002
Now, this roach motel, fleabag motel,

550
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:03,402
just ain't gonna fly.
Put us in a wing.

551
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,202
Just rent a wing at the Remington.

552
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:07,502
And we can just move on from there.
And here's another thing--

553
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:09,601
The Remington
is a five-star hotel, buddy.

554
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,002
That's not even a start.

555
00:29:11,106 --> 00:29:12,282
You know what?

556
00:29:12,805 --> 00:29:15,750
When we bring that entire
town of Dillon over here,

557
00:29:15,908 --> 00:29:18,002
which you know is gonna happen,

558
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:20,503
this place is gonna be sold out.

559
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:23,123
Concession business
is gonna go through the roof.

560
00:29:23,158 --> 00:29:27,501
Now, I bet if you picked up
the phone and called the hotel

561
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:33,001
and explained that to them,
they would bring those rates down.

562
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,502
You sure you don't coach football?

563
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,501
I leave that to my husband.

564
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,443
Hey.

565
00:30:34,477 --> 00:30:36,000
To, uh, to what do I owe this visit?

566
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,302
Oh, nothing, really.
I just, um...

567
00:30:38,908 --> 00:30:41,302
figured we're the only two left in town.

568
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,532
So...stopped by to rent a movie.

569
00:30:44,637 --> 00:30:47,571
Then...I had a better idea.

570
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:49,670
I figured, what the hell.

571
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:52,830
Yeah?

572
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:55,873
What else am I doing tonight?

573
00:30:57,035 --> 00:30:59,401
Oh, hey, Corrina!

574
00:30:59,537 --> 00:31:01,900
Hit me, baby.

575
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:04,000
- Hey, Junior.
- What's up man?

576
00:31:04,305 --> 00:31:06,431
- Long time no see.
- What up, dog?

577
00:31:08,237 --> 00:31:09,331
Don't eat it.

578
00:31:10,878 --> 00:31:13,101
Whenever you have a barbecue in the hood,

579
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,131
everybody just show up at your house?

580
00:31:14,177 --> 00:31:15,133
Yeah.

581
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:17,751
But, hey...
remember Tony Corwin?

582
00:31:17,796 --> 00:31:18,503
Yeah.

583
00:31:18,605 --> 00:31:21,523
Doing a bid for 10.
Armed robbery.

584
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:25,502
- Damn.
- Seems like you and me

585
00:31:25,557 --> 00:31:28,902
are just about the only guys
from the hood that got a decent shot.

586
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:34,802
But, you know, coming back here just some--
It just opens up old wounds.

587
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:36,851
Michael was the reason we stayed here.

588
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:40,000
And after he died, I thought it
was better for us to leave.

589
00:31:40,058 --> 00:31:43,501
I hate to admit it, girl,
but sometimes, I don't even miss him.

590
00:31:43,598 --> 00:31:45,602
I know I don't miss
staying up late at night,

591
00:31:45,805 --> 00:31:48,593
wondering whether
he coming home or not.

592
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:52,102
I actually think we might
be better off with him dead.

593
00:31:56,927 --> 00:31:57,751
Brian.

594
00:31:57,896 --> 00:31:59,550
Brian!

595
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:03,322
Baby!

596
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:11,021
That was awful!

597
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:17,092
Well, come on. Do it again.

598
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:19,090
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God.

599
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,122
No way.

600
00:32:22,155 --> 00:32:25,502
"Here's to good friends in Texas."

601
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,692
"Texas forever."

602
00:32:29,357 --> 00:32:31,353
"I'm the perfect Lyla Garrity!"

603
00:32:31,395 --> 00:32:33,521
"Go, Panthers!"

604
00:32:38,327 --> 00:32:39,623
God.

605
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:43,291
Can you believe that's all
these people talk about?

606
00:32:45,226 --> 00:32:47,120
You think you'll ever forgive him?

607
00:32:48,598 --> 00:32:50,323
Will you ever forgive her?

608
00:32:52,955 --> 00:32:55,023
Here's to real friends in Texas.

609
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,022
Amen.

610
00:33:06,827 --> 00:33:08,751
Lord have mercy.

611
00:33:08,797 --> 00:33:10,402
You know you missed bed check.

612
00:33:10,507 --> 00:33:11,301
I know.

613
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:13,193
I'll talk to coach and smooth things out.

614
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:16,502
- But where you been?
- I went to go see the old house.

615
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:19,952
I'm sorry, Mama.

616
00:33:31,255 --> 00:33:32,552
Let me ask you something.

617
00:33:33,508 --> 00:33:35,792
What all do you remember
about that night?

618
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:38,091
- Dad's accident?
- Mm-hmm.

619
00:33:38,128 --> 00:33:42,002
I remember it was late, and Dad was
coming home from work by himself.

620
00:33:42,128 --> 00:33:47,002
And...some lady ran a red light,
and he never stood a chance.

621
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,853
Uncle Rookie showed me
the pictures once.

622
00:33:49,997 --> 00:33:51,153
You're right.

623
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:53,223
It was late at night.

624
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:56,400
But he wasn't coming home from work,
and he wasn't by his self.

625
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:58,220
- Who was he with?
- Doesn't matter.

626
00:33:58,255 --> 00:34:00,551
You don't know, and I didn't either.

627
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,400
Now, your daddy wasn't a perfect man.

628
00:34:04,597 --> 00:34:06,853
Lord knows we had
our share of problems.

629
00:34:06,998 --> 00:34:11,002
But I just need you to know...
that I loved him.

630
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:12,521
And he loved you.

631
00:34:12,907 --> 00:34:16,603
I know I still get angry sometimes.
And then I get sad, and then I...

632
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:19,853
I say stupid stuff
like I did tonight.

633
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:24,022
He'd have been so proud of you.

634
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:27,202
There wasn't a person in the world
your daddy couldn't charm.

635
00:34:27,328 --> 00:34:29,392
You got that from him.

636
00:34:29,906 --> 00:34:31,820
I just thank God...

637
00:34:31,957 --> 00:34:34,292
you got the best parts of him.

638
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:23,002
<i>Please welcome the Dillon Panthers!</i>

639
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:31,671
<i>And now, your own Gatling Eagles!</i>

640
00:35:47,357 --> 00:35:48,420
Y'all goin' down!

641
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:49,921
Y'all on the wrong side of town now!

642
00:35:49,956 --> 00:35:52,692
This is my home! Yo!

643
00:35:52,728 --> 00:35:55,220
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
Y'all ain't ready!

644
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:56,820
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about, baby.

645
00:35:56,858 --> 00:35:58,520
Let's go!

646
00:36:11,528 --> 00:36:12,623
Get 'em out of here, guys!

647
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:13,593
Guys, get 'em the hell out of here!

648
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:15,591
Come on. Let's go.

649
00:36:15,627 --> 00:36:17,791
Let's put our heads together right now.

650
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:19,722
We knew this is what was coming.

651
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:21,353
And we knew this is what
they were gonna bring.

652
00:36:21,398 --> 00:36:22,993
Now let's go
give it right back to 'em.

653
00:36:23,027 --> 00:36:25,303
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir!

654
00:36:25,428 --> 00:36:26,900
Play smart tonight!

655
00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:28,923
- Smash!
- Hey, I'm right here, coach.

656
00:36:28,996 --> 00:36:32,200
Take them out. This ain't their house,
this is my house!

657
00:36:32,295 --> 00:36:34,391
My field!
My blood is in this house!

658
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:36,822
They wanna live the pain,
we gonna give 'em pain!

659
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:39,001
We takin' this house
back tonight!

660
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:44,993
<i>You talk about slobber-knocker football,</i>

661
00:36:45,027 --> 00:36:48,703
<i>this has been one ferocious match-up.
A defensive battle..</i>

662
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:53,202
<i>And here we are in the fourth quarter,
deadlocked at zero, zero.</i>

663
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:56,200
<i>Smash Williams has been shut down.
Saracen's been contained.</i>

664
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:59,250
<i>And Tim Riggins has been beaten
like an old rug.</i>

665
00:36:59,295 --> 00:37:00,693
<i>And the punishment has been handed out</i>

666
00:37:00,727 --> 00:37:03,201
<i>by Gatling's huge middle linebacker,</i>

667
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:05,293
<i>Junior Silverio.</i>

668
00:37:05,328 --> 00:37:08,823
<i>First and ten on their own 12.</i>

669
00:37:08,855 --> 00:37:10,850
<i>Saracen hands off on the run to Smash.</i>

670
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:13,253
<i>Oh, and he's hit immediately by Silverio!</i>

671
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:16,851
<i>Junior Silverio on the tackle.</i>

672
00:37:20,896 --> 00:37:22,351
<i>Saracen drops back.</i>

673
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:24,921
<i>He's got Smash Williams open
on the left for a screen.</i>

674
00:37:24,957 --> 00:37:27,491
<i>Ohh! And he's hit by Silverio again.</i>

675
00:37:27,527 --> 00:37:29,191
<i>Silverio again on the side.</i>

676
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:30,652
Put him on his back, right now!

677
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:33,090
You put him on his back!

678
00:37:34,398 --> 00:37:35,692
<i>They have to be careful here,</i>

679
00:37:35,728 --> 00:37:37,722
<i>standing near their own goal line.</i>

680
00:37:42,207 --> 00:37:43,822
<i>Oh, and Riggins is hit!!</i>

681
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:44,851
<i>He's hit by Silverio</i>

682
00:37:44,906 --> 00:37:46,402
<i>for a safety.</i>

683
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:49,853
<i>And that is two points for the Gatling Eagles!</i>

684
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:53,550
<i>And it may not be pretty, folks,
but it might be enough, and--</i>

685
00:37:53,627 --> 00:37:55,421
<i>Hold on, hold on. Looks like--</i>

686
00:37:55,455 --> 00:37:57,393
<i>Looks like Riggins is hurt.</i>

687
00:37:57,426 --> 00:37:59,392
<i>Being helped off the field by Smash.</i>

688
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:00,822
<i>And it does not look good.</i>

689
00:38:00,957 --> 00:38:05,001
<i>It has just gone from bad to worse here
for Coach Taylor.</i>

690
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,052
Hey, slut, Riggins is over here.

691
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:08,421
Riggins is that way!

692
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:10,223
What are you gonna do, huh?

693
00:38:10,508 --> 00:38:12,092
How was Riggins? We heard about it.

694
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:16,023
Hey, Lyla, does Riggins
prefer boxers or briefs?

695
00:38:16,057 --> 00:38:18,893
- What are they saying?
- I don't know, I can't...

696
00:38:18,995 --> 00:38:19,992
Who's next?

697
00:38:20,026 --> 00:38:22,351
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe!

698
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:26,952
You get around, girl.

699
00:38:26,996 --> 00:38:28,792
Hey!

700
00:38:28,827 --> 00:38:29,892
What was that?

701
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:31,353
Ohh!

702
00:38:31,398 --> 00:38:33,053
Damn, bitch.

703
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:34,552
What the hell is going on?

704
00:38:36,196 --> 00:38:37,793
I don't know. I'm going down there.

705
00:38:37,826 --> 00:38:38,920
Wait, wait, wait.
This one's me.

706
00:38:38,955 --> 00:38:40,093
This one's me.

707
00:38:40,127 --> 00:38:41,353
I'll be right back, babe.

708
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:42,921
I'll take care of this.

709
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:44,393
<i>25-yard kickoff return by...</i>

710
00:38:44,427 --> 00:38:45,822
I'll be back.

711
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:49,222
<i>First and ten, Gatling
from their own 40-yard-line.</i>

712
00:38:57,207 --> 00:38:59,293
Honey, what happened out there?

713
00:38:59,808 --> 00:39:02,292
What's going on?

714
00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:05,750
You gotta tell me, baby.

715
00:39:06,895 --> 00:39:08,353
What is it?

716
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:14,220
- I lost Jason.
- What?

717
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:22,092
I was unfaithful, Daddy.

718
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,693
Well...

719
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:36,003
We all... make mistakes.

720
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:39,823
And we--we grow up.

721
00:39:40,507 --> 00:39:42,352
But you're my little girl.

722
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:46,202
You're my daughter, and I want you
to always remember that.

723
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:52,250
You've never left a game before.

724
00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:57,052
It's only a game.

725
00:39:57,405 --> 00:39:59,753
You're my daughter.

726
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:04,653
All right, offense on me!

727
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:05,953
On me, listen up now.

728
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:08,000
Listen, we got one more shot at this.

729
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:09,253
Let's make it count.
You understand?

730
00:40:09,296 --> 00:40:10,453
Let's go get 'em!

731
00:40:10,498 --> 00:40:11,991
Let's go!
Let's go!

732
00:40:16,626 --> 00:40:18,192
<i>Riggins!</i>

733
00:40:19,798 --> 00:40:22,420
It's time for you
to give the best you got.

734
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:24,700
- You got one more in you?
- Yes, sir.

735
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:26,522
All right, then. Let's go.

736
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,801
<i>Well, this is all she wrote, folks.</i>

737
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:36,521
<i>Taylor has 13 seconds left to work with.
Hold on a second.</i>

738
00:40:37,556 --> 00:40:40,152
<i>The big Tim Riggins
is coming onto the field!</i>

739
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:42,421
<i>He is really digging deep here tonight.</i>

740
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:45,292
<i>and showing his teammates
what he's made of.</i>

741
00:40:45,428 --> 00:40:46,853
Way to tough it out, Rig.

742
00:40:48,106 --> 00:40:49,321
All right, Rig.
Do this.

743
00:40:49,356 --> 00:40:51,503
Let's go, gentlemen.
Guys, listen up.

744
00:40:51,608 --> 00:40:54,503
We're going pro, right, 28, shovel.
On one. Ready?

745
00:40:55,108 --> 00:40:58,502
<i>Now, the Dillon faithful
are on their feet.</i>

746
00:40:58,785 --> 00:41:01,751
<i>Let's see if Coach Taylor can
put some lipstick on this pig.</i>

747
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:03,251
Blue 80!

748
00:41:03,507 --> 00:41:04,193
Get ready!

749
00:41:04,227 --> 00:41:05,593
Get ready, Smash!

750
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,020
Blue! 38!

751
00:41:07,058 --> 00:41:08,720
Hut!

752
00:41:10,055 --> 00:41:11,421
<i>He pitches it off to Smash!</i>

753
00:41:11,457 --> 00:41:13,502
<i>Oh, and Silverio's got him in his sights!</i>

754
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,552
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

755
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:17,422
<i>And he has laid down on Tim Riggins!</i>

756
00:41:17,457 --> 00:41:18,623
<i>And he has sprung!</i>

757
00:41:18,696 --> 00:41:20,900
<i>Smash Williams do the left side!</i>

758
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:23,352
<i>Do you believe in miracles, folks?!</i>

759
00:41:23,395 --> 00:41:26,201
<i>Because I just saw one!</i>

760
00:41:26,308 --> 00:41:27,920
<i>Touchdown! Dillon Panthers!</i>

761
00:41:27,957 --> 00:41:30,750
<i>And that is the ball game!</i>

762
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:34,222
<i>Dillon wins!
Dillon wins!!</i>

763
00:41:48,286 --> 00:41:49,520
That was a great game!

764
00:41:54,357 --> 00:41:57,093
Um...I gotta go.

765
00:42:05,217 --> 00:42:06,271
How's your shoulder?

766
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,613
- I'll live.
- Yeah?

767
00:42:07,646 --> 00:42:08,610
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you will.

768
00:42:20,047 --> 00:42:21,343
Come here, baby.

769
00:42:22,677 --> 00:42:24,372
Let's go home, mama.

770
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:25,772
Let's go home.

771
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,402
- Yes, baby, let's go home.
- Let's go home.

772
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:30,202
Let's go home.

773
00:42:30,448 --> 00:42:32,542
Oh, I'm proud of you
