1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,423
It's me, Matt, your son.

2
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:06,718
That is not my quarterback, you're
my quarterback. You understand that?

3
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:09,930
- We had a meeting, funds are frozen.
- Who had a meeting ?

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,391
All the people I've been out trying
to get money from, for the Jumbo Tron.

5
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:15,810
I'm sorry
it happened this way, Tami.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,021
People warn me
about getting into this with you.

7
00:00:18,465 --> 00:00:20,357
I tell them you're a good guy.

8
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:21,858
- You are, right?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:23,610
- What's up, Coach?
- 2 weeks time.

10
00:00:23,878 --> 00:00:26,363
- We got a walk on Texas A&M.
- I'll make you proud.

11
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:34,663
<i>At this time we ask you to stand and
remove cover for our national anthem.</i>

12
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:43,957
<i>Ladies & Gentlemen,
the time has come...</i>

13
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,083
<i>but before we get started</i>

14
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:49,218
<i>before we introduce
our young kids...</i>

15
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,912
That's an angry horse,
right there.

16
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:09,815
- Who wanted the cotton candy?
- I'll have some. I'll have some.

17
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:11,700
- You want it?
- You want any?

18
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,536
I'm not having any.
I was gonna get y'all some.

19
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:18,215
I'm having my wisdom teeth
taken out tomorrow.

20
00:01:18,385 --> 00:01:21,182
I'm not trying to gum up...
Something funny?

21
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:23,387
I'm having major surgery
and you're laughing.

22
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:26,152
- You're gonna laugh in my face.
- They give you laughing gas.

23
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,550
I don't think laughing gas
is a laughing matter.

24
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:29,771
Sorry.

25
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:34,252
How about I come over afterwards,
and nurse you. We'll watch a movie.

26
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:36,572
Can you guys focus for 2 seconds?
Cash is up next.

27
00:01:36,692 --> 00:01:38,511
All he needs is an 80 to win.

28
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:40,186
Come on, Cash!
Let's go, man!

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,117
<i>A score of 80 will be first place</i>

30
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:51,023
<i>for Dillon, Texas man.</i>

31
00:01:51,548 --> 00:01:54,860
<i>Holding on for a full eight seconds.
He's there!</i>

32
00:01:57,106 --> 00:01:59,645
That is one fine ass cowboy.

33
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:01,952
Really?
I didn't notice.

34
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:06,122
<i>82.82 for Cash Browler</i>

35
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:10,001
<i>We have our winner, Cash Browler.</i>

36
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:13,754
<i>The winner of our rodeo,
your hometown cowboy from Dillon, Texas.</i>

37
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:15,214
<i>Cash Browler!</i>

38
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:23,938
Come on. Drive some feet.

39
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:26,049
- Damn it, drive your legs!
- I'm driving them.

40
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:27,858
No, you're not driving your legs!

41
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:32,080
Go! Drive! Drive!

42
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:35,205
There you go.
Get something to drink.

43
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:38,956
They changed the walk-on date?

44
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,705
Right. You got an extra 24 hours.

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,320
- Why did they change it?
- I guess they're busy.

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,461
Mitch thinks you got a better chance
with Helling on Sunday, anyway.

47
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:47,787
Who's Mitch?

48
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:50,048
- What's that?
- Who's Mitch, anyway?

49
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:53,749
- He's the one who set everything up.
- Is he pretty tight with Coach Helling?

50
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:56,213
- Yeah, he is.
- So, who's he?

51
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:58,813
Offensive coordinator?
Running back coach?

52
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:02,530
I tell you what. Why don't you worry
a little bit less about who he is,

53
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,841
and a little bit more about yourself
on Sunday. How is that?

54
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:07,649
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

55
00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:09,935
Drive, damn it. Come on!

56
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:26,619
So... $10,000 to ride a horse, uh?

57
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:30,046
He wasn't that into it,
but my landlord is gonna be happy.

58
00:03:32,198 --> 00:03:33,804
Tyra Colette, man.

59
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,428
Billy never mentioned that Mindy's
little sister turned into a goddess.

60
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:40,049
That's some...

61
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:47,097
So, you gonna be in town for a while,
or you're just stopping by?

62
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:48,808
Yeah, actually, I am.

63
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,848
What happened with that guy
that was with y'all?

64
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:58,073
He's all nervous. He's getting
his wisdom teeth pulled, tomorrow.

65
00:03:58,193 --> 00:03:59,242
I hate that.

66
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:04,038
Is he your boyfriend?
Cause you know, I respect that if he is.

67
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:06,165
No. God, no.

68
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,115
- We're just friends.
- Just friends...

69
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:10,344
That's all.

70
00:04:12,823 --> 00:04:14,816
You wanna... You wanna dance?

71
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:21,817
Subtitles: Team Panthers

72
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:24,945

73
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:29,200

74
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,827
3x04: HELLO, GOODBYE

75
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:40,051
Hey, honey.
I'm sure getting hungry.

76
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:42,302
Sorry, Grandma.
Your oatmeal is almost ready.

77
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:45,279
It's Tuesday.
I want that milk toast on Tuesday.

78
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,999
No, it's Thursday,
and you get the oatmeal.

79
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:50,638
Well...
I just don't want oatmeal today.

80
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:53,314
Please look. It's cinnamon & apple.
You like it. Come on.

81
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:55,611
Landry can't give me a ride.
I gotta get the bus...

82
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,860
Who's that JD McCoy
they're showing on the TV?

83
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:00,854
He's nobody.

84
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:04,617
It's a by-week, so they're just trying
to find something to talk about.

85
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:07,804
- Yeah, they don't do that on you.
- Be good.

86
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,536
I'm not gonna eat that.

87
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,255
You got it? Looking good, right here.
That'll be good.

88
00:06:20,176 --> 00:06:22,218
- This is the principal.
- Hey, Buddy.

89
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:24,642
- Can I ask you what y'all are doing?
- Nothing.

90
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:28,384
Well, just a little preliminary survey
for the new school board.

91
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:30,803
On whose authority?

92
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:33,889
Well, mine I guess.

93
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:37,092
It's funny. You know you don't have
that kind of authority, Buddy.

94
00:06:37,212 --> 00:06:39,246
- I don't?
- No. You sure do not.

95
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,768
So this is gonna have to...

96
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:44,272
Y'all gentlemen. Thank you very much.
You can go on, now.

97
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:46,414
This is a no, thank you.

98
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:50,747
We have a meeting this week with
the board to discuss this Jumbo Tron.

99
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,457
I know we have a meeting,

100
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:54,721
but I have an obligation
to the boosters

101
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:57,657
to be ready
just in case our side wins.

102
00:06:57,827 --> 00:07:01,198
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to bully this through.

103
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:04,385
It's not gonna happen.
I'm gonna go in front of that board

104
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:06,970
and make sure superintendent Dunley
hears what I'm saying.

105
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,174
Paul wants to hear what you have to say.
He's very interested.

106
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:12,711
He told me that this weekend
at the country club.

107
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:14,979
You played golf with Paul Dunley
this weekend?

108
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:18,514
I play with him all the time.
I've known him forever.

109
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:20,548
He buys all his cars from me.

110
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,015
- Put it on your cheek.
- Why is it so bright?

111
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:25,983
It's outside.
It's daytime.

112
00:07:26,243 --> 00:07:28,576
Let me know if you feel
like you gonna fall.

113
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:29,994
Step! You OK?

114
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,788
Just that I'm high...

115
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:34,950
I'm so glad you came pick me up
with the mini van,

116
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,187
cause I love this mini van.

117
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:41,957
- It's a sign of comfort for me.
- I'm so glad.

118
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:47,585
You're done?

119
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:50,839
- <i>How did it go?</i>
- It went great.

120
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:55,006
They were playing Lionel Ritchie "Lady".
And I love that song.

121
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:57,222
And listen.
You listen?

122
00:07:58,064 --> 00:08:01,101
<i>I think me, you and </i>Repo Man

123
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:03,729
and a bunch of Cherry Garcia

124
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:07,802
- <i>at my house...</i>
- That sounds like a fantastic idea.

125
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:09,325
<i>I just wanted to say</i>

126
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:12,328
that you're the best girlfriend
that a guy could want.

127
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:13,989
- Landry?
- <i>I know</i>

128
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:17,415
that you're not my girlfriend per say,
but I love you anyways.

129
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:19,536
<i>My mom is taking my phone away.</i>

130
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:23,624
Hey, Tyra. Landry's gotta go.
We'll see you this evening, OK?

131
00:08:24,106 --> 00:08:25,250
Bye bye.

132
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,754
- What? Why did you do that?
- You'll thank me later.

133
00:08:30,447 --> 00:08:33,114
We got a by-week. We gonna start
working on spread offense.

134
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:35,375
McNaulty's got a hell of a defense
this year.

135
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:38,688
They gonna be sitting on the I
and pounding Saracen all night long.

136
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:40,943
I can garan-damn-tee you, gentlemen.

137
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,401
We are not gonna repeat
the loss we had last week.

138
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:47,029
- You wanna build it around McCoy.
- Didn't say that.

139
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:49,449
How about Coach asks us
to work on a spread offense,

140
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:52,075
we work on it
and we don't ask any questions.

141
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:55,038
- I'm just asking.
- Well don't ask. Do not ask!

142
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,042
- Are we done here, Coach?
- Yeah, Mac. We're done.

143
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:01,230
Meeting between 2 and 3 in the bullpen
to start hammering out the details.

144
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,700
Alright, you all heard the man.
You all get back to work.

145
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:09,511
You need something?

146
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:13,758
So, we go with McCoy, here, Eric?
Is that what we're doing?

147
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:17,093
I don't know, Mac.

148
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,104
Alright.

149
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,293
I'll talk to you later.

150
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:33,004
- Is she waving at me?
- No, she's waving at me. Shut up!

151
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:34,377
Who is that, man?

152
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:36,453
I was hoping that was you.

153
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,111
What are you doing?

154
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:39,283
Nothing.

155
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:42,829
I was driving back from San Antonio
on a work thing.

156
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,637
Is it alright if I stop here?
I don't wanna block anybody.

157
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:48,410
- You're actually not supposed to stop.
- Okay, well...

158
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,259
Where are you going?
Can I give you a ride home or something?

159
00:09:54,374 --> 00:09:56,134
Alright. Yeah, fine.

160
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:58,768
- I'm gonna get a ride.
- You sure, Matt?

161
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,732
- Alright.
- Alright.

162
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:13,031
It's just over there.

163
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,853
Yeah, I remember.

164
00:10:17,164 --> 00:10:19,287
Wow, you got your own sign!
That's kinda cool.

165
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:25,054
Everybody gets one,
so it's not really a big deal.

166
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,629
- Thanks for the ride.
- You're welcome.

167
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:35,771
So, I guess I'll see you.

168
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:44,567
Thank you.

169
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:46,262
You're welcome.

170
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:53,434
Hey Matt! Wait a second.

171
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,726
It seems like
you got a lot on your plate, and...

172
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,867
I guess I was just wondering if
there is anything I can do to help out.

173
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,121
No. We're good.

174
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:08,946
OK. Good, good.

175
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:12,215
Cause I was just thinking
that while I'm in town...

176
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,092
How long are you in town for?

177
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:16,663
No long term or anything.
I just...

178
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,226
I just would really love
to help out, that's all.

179
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:26,295
OK, look...

180
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:31,096
I'm supposed to take Grandma
to an orthopedist appointment

181
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:33,015
tomorrow afternoon, but...

182
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:36,083
I mean I got this really big test
the next day.

183
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:37,927
Yeah. That'd be perfect.

184
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,703
- I'll take her to the doctor, tomorrow.
- At 4 o'clock?

185
00:11:43,178 --> 00:11:44,659
4:00. See you then.

186
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:57,316
How is it going?

187
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,680
Let's go. Let's go have your snack.
Grandma.

188
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:02,633
Come on. Just...

189
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:06,644
Here we go.

190
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,874
- That's disgusting. I don't know.
- Here's what you do.

191
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:15,862
You break in it to join,
you slide your thumbs under it,

192
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:17,975
and then you just...

193
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:19,913
Oh God.

194
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:22,702
- All right.
- That's how you do it.

195
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,458
- There you go.
- I can't do it.

196
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:27,100
- Do that one.
- Really?

197
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,792
- That's good.
- Yeah, do it.

198
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:31,096
- Suck it, suck it, there we go.
- Nice.

199
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:34,875
And if you're really cool,
here's what you do with the head.

200
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:40,839
- See, that's just wrong.
- Yeah, it's not that good.

201
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:44,265
See, he's got a lot
of useless skills like that.

202
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:45,777
You know he speaks french?

203
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:48,645
I mean, I'm telling you, there's nothing
weirder than seeing some drunk ass

204
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,647
- cow-boy speaking french.
- Come on.

205
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,297
- Where did you learn to speak french?
- Picked it up in Louisiana.

206
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:57,530
- When did you live in Louisiana?
- Grew up there and then moved to Dillon

207
00:12:57,741 --> 00:13:01,185
when I was in high school, where I met
this fine upstanding citizen.

208
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:02,445
Oh yeah.

209
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:04,766
You'd have seen this kid
pitching in high school.

210
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:07,163
He's ridiculous.
He had a canon for an arm.

211
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:10,125
He could have gotten a scholarship
to any school he wanted to go to.

212
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:11,831
Base-ball is too slow and boring.

213
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:14,686
Right now,
I like to ride broncos and to rodeo.

214
00:13:17,724 --> 00:13:20,045
Yeah, there he is, Mitch Stallman.

215
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:22,719
He's in charge of...

216
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,092
group sales.

217
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:28,850
I'm gonna work
at Alamo Freeze till I die.

218
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,933
You just gonna trust Coach, man.
I mean, he knows what he's doing so...

219
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:34,473
Smash, Matt?

220
00:13:34,643 --> 00:13:38,105
I'm really glad I could provide you
with beverages and wi-fi

221
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:42,115
and all of you can possibly want
but Tyra is gonna be over pretty soon.

222
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:44,041
I thought she broke up
a long time ago.

223
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:45,363
Yeah, she did.

224
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:48,819
- Your facts aren't quite correct.
- Is that right?

225
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:53,209
See, Tyra is a complicated woman
and it's a very complicated situation...

226
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:55,962
- Let's get out of here, man.
- I'd worry if she wasn't doing this.

227
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,822
It's getting sad and weird in here
and I need to keep my mood up.

228
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:00,978
I heard every bit
of what you just said, man.

229
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:02,178
Later, Lan, man.

230
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,062
If she doesn't show up,
give me a call, okay?

231
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:06,926
She will show up, Matt.

232
00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:10,727
I can not believe Billy's really
gonna get married.

233
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,832
I can't believe
my sister's marrying Billy.

234
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,273
Yeah, I'm really surprised myself.

235
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:17,777
- They kinda make a perfect couple.
- They look good.

236
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:21,507
We are not going to San Antonio
on our honeymoon.

237
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:24,596
- Why not?
- Cause you're taking me to Hawaii.

238
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,367
- How the hell am I gonna afford Hawaii?
- I don't know.

239
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:29,095
We'll have to win the lottery.

240
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:32,492
- What's that?
- Just a little bit of cow-boy candy.

241
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:34,959
I busted my shoulder
in Mineola last week.

242
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:38,631
That's so weird. Remember when I busted
my shoulder last week, in Mineola?

243
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:41,007
No, nice try though.

244
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:52,883
You wanna... get out of here?
Leave these guys alone?

245
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:56,642
- Sure.
- Yeah?

246
00:14:57,018 --> 00:14:58,513
- Let's go.
- Okay.

247
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:01,694
- Billy, I'll see you later, bud.
- Bye all.

248
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,776
Have a fun time.

249
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:19,698
What's wrong?

250
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:24,898
I'm gonna take a pass on tonight.

251
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:30,268
My friend Landry,
he had his wisdom teeth pulled today.

252
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,938
And I've told him I'd go
over there and help,

253
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,810
- so...
- Yeah, well...

254
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:38,523
I got a pretty good idea
about that.

255
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:40,716
What's that?

256
00:15:58,278 --> 00:15:59,279
Okay...

257
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:01,963
- Let's go.
- Alright.

258
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:10,915
And then, he's just going on about

259
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:13,383
"Oh yeah, I talked all about it
with Paul Dunley,

260
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:15,635
"I just played golf with him
last week-end."

261
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:18,062
How am I suppose to compete with that?
You know what I mean?

262
00:16:18,486 --> 00:16:20,152
I don't play golf.
So, they...

263
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,233
You should learn,
it's fun if you bring beer!

264
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:24,779
- I hate golf.
- Could we slow down just a little bit?

265
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,615
Yeah, sorry. You know this whole thing
is just a boys club, and you know...

266
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:30,575
Honey, you should've known that!

267
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:32,682
Okay, can I tell you something?

268
00:16:32,802 --> 00:16:35,213
And don't be mad at me,
cause I didn't invent the world,

269
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,325
but nobody likes an angry woman.

270
00:16:37,811 --> 00:16:40,251
I am not angry, I am not angry.
That is the thing,

271
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:43,129
I've dealt with this with self-dignity
and they've just been riding

272
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:46,676
- rough all over me.
- You're angry underneath, you see?

273
00:16:46,846 --> 00:16:48,980
And that honey,
is just a waste of your time.

274
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,181
So look, you gotta make a plan here.
Gotta plan your move.

275
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:54,911
So, you don't play golf?
You eat, don't ya?

276
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:56,885
- I do.
- Okay, so here's what you do.

277
00:16:57,005 --> 00:17:00,481
You find out where Dunley has his coffee
and you go there and you chat him up.

278
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:03,900
- That's a good idea, I kinda stalk him.
- And honey, wear you hair down.

279
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:06,021
Wear down...

280
00:17:15,787 --> 00:17:17,455
I meant to call you, I'm so sorry.

281
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,099
Well, what happened?

282
00:17:21,469 --> 00:17:24,819
I had to be with my mum last night,
she got some bad news.

283
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:28,216
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Is she okay?

284
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:31,189
Yeah, it wasn't actually her,
it was my aunt.

285
00:17:32,106 --> 00:17:35,656
Some medical stuff. It looks like
she's gonna be okay though.

286
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:37,016
So, how are you doing?

287
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,424
You know, fine.

288
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:42,480
I can't feel my face still, but...

289
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:46,583
Sorry, I actually have to get going.

290
00:17:46,703 --> 00:17:49,822
I've to read the entire book
of Julius Caesar in 45 minutes, so...

291
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:51,960
Technical exploit.

292
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:55,227
I'm sorry, Lan.

293
00:17:56,321 --> 00:17:57,788
I'll see you later?

294
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:05,227
Alright, gentlemen,
let's go now, it's Friday.

295
00:18:05,347 --> 00:18:06,714
We got a long week-end.

296
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,085
I've been changing it up, we're gonna
rotate snaps between Saracen and J.D.

297
00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:13,094
Go 7 on 7.
Coaches, get 'em together.

298
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:17,358
I wanna hear some hustle out here.
Let's hear it right now. Let's go!

299
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:11,052
Let's see it again, gentlemen.

300
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:15,576
- It's not that big a deal.
- Well, I don't understand it.

301
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,047
You always take me
to my doctor's appointment.

302
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:21,801
- Today is a little different.
- Well, I don't like different,

303
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,248
and I don't like her.
And I'm going back in the house.

304
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:26,959
- Now, let me go!
- Please, I've had a really rough day,

305
00:19:27,172 --> 00:19:30,555
and I got a lot of studying to do
and it's gonna help me out so much if...

306
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:32,548
if you'd just go with her
to the doctor.

307
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:33,946
Please...

308
00:19:44,273 --> 00:19:47,063
- This is a bad idea...
- Don't worry, we'll be fine.

309
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:58,616
I wanna tell just cause you were married
to my son, doesn't make you family.

310
00:19:59,354 --> 00:20:01,452
I'm only doing this for Matthew.

311
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:05,541
Okay, well, it's the only reason
I'm doing too. So, let's just go.

312
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,138
I need some air back here.

313
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:10,963
This junker got some air, right?

314
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:15,419
So Katty McCoy thinks
I should track down Paul Dumley

315
00:20:15,678 --> 00:20:17,426
like find where he eats
or something.

316
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:20,028
You know,
like stalking kind of thing.

317
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:22,932
But I don't know, that's not my style
however, it feels pushy to me.

318
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,164
But maybe that's
what I need to be doing,

319
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:28,113
because obviously that's what
everybody else is doing, you know?

320
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:30,017
It's just so frustrating.

321
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:31,992
Honey, where are we going?
Honey...

322
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:34,153
- What's going on?
- I need a drink.

323
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:38,407
- We got a bottle of wine in the fridge.
- I need a scotch flavour of drink.

324
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:42,675
Let me call Julie.

325
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:44,594
There is no doubt that J.D. McCoy,

326
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:47,832
he wins out when it comes
to physical skills, I understand that.

327
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,457
Hell, he's got the best arm any
high school quarterback have ever seen.

328
00:20:51,577 --> 00:20:53,125
That includes Jason Street.

329
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:55,845
- That's saying something right there.
- But then again, Matt...

330
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:58,967
Well, Matt got the experience,
he's got 3 seasons under his belt,

331
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:03,087
the team knows how to play with Matt,
I know what I've got with Matt Saracen.

332
00:21:04,526 --> 00:21:08,126
- That's a hard decision to do.
- After everything he's been through,

333
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:09,986
I bench him...

334
00:21:10,954 --> 00:21:13,153
halfway through his senior year...

335
00:21:13,952 --> 00:21:15,850
- It'd kill him.
- I know.

336
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,210
- And he's like family.
- I can't make a decision based on that.

337
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,658
- I know, of course you can't.
- Of course, I can't.

338
00:21:24,355 --> 00:21:27,079
But honey, this is the stuff
that happens, this is football.

339
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:28,991
- Yes, it is.
- And...

340
00:21:29,252 --> 00:21:32,293
it just seems to me that you don't
have to have this set in stone.

341
00:21:32,506 --> 00:21:35,080
You could take one game
at the time if you want to.

342
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,039
Honey, I don't think you understand...
If I start J.D. McCoy

343
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:41,708
- the significance of that...
- I think I do.

344
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:44,231
The kid is good,
you got to understand that.

345
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:47,316
But he's also a 15-year-old kid
with a freak show of a father.

346
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:50,811
If I put him out there on the field,
I don't know if he's gonna handle it.

347
00:21:51,155 --> 00:21:54,650
The fact that matters is, it's my
responsibility to that kid to make sure

348
00:21:54,861 --> 00:21:58,235
that he's not pushed too fast
and that he's prepared.

349
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:03,156
- What the hell is so funny?
- Honey...

350
00:22:04,186 --> 00:22:06,494
- What are you laughing at?
- This is what I love about you.

351
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,038
That I can't make a decision
to save my damn life?

352
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:11,435
That you're making
a decision with...

353
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:13,942
With such a conscience and...

354
00:22:15,162 --> 00:22:18,668
What other coach would ever do that?
Nowise agonize over like that.

355
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:21,859
And you know, I think
it's cause you're a teacher first,

356
00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:24,345
and I know
you're gonna say it's corny,

357
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,161
but you're a molder of men.

358
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:29,934
And I find that admirable.

359
00:22:31,294 --> 00:22:32,849
And I find that sexy.

360
00:22:37,634 --> 00:22:40,254
Let me tell you what, I'll have
to ruminate on that a little bit longer

361
00:22:40,374 --> 00:22:43,095
- since you find it so damn sexy.
- Okay...

362
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:51,742
Slow to the motion.

363
00:22:53,212 --> 00:22:54,303
There you go.

364
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,496
There it is.
Nice and slow.

365
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:59,464
Watch your foot placement.
Gimme another going.

366
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,426
- What do you know, gentlemen?
- Hey, Coach.

367
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:03,703
- Hey, Wade...
- You stopped by.

368
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:09,771
Texas quick fire, H is in motion.
What does X have to do?

369
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:12,032
- Watch my strong side.
- Right.

370
00:23:13,307 --> 00:23:15,347
- I'm looking corner post left.
- What's the read?

371
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:16,758
Free safety.

372
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:21,022
3rd long and they're 45 down by 7.
One minute to go, Z is the hot on 99.

373
00:23:21,282 --> 00:23:23,478
Defense goes nick.
What you gonna do then?

374
00:23:23,598 --> 00:23:25,902
I'm outer block to prevent.
Look for Riggins.

375
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:28,119
No, look for X.
On the quick out for the 1st.

376
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,398
- What's the life color in the articles?
- Depends.

377
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:32,499
Last week it was blue.
This week, it's red.

378
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,924
You've been paying attention,
or something?

379
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:37,587
- Yes, sir.
- Tell me something about yourself.

380
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:40,423
I set goals and I achieve them.

381
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:44,010
This isn't a job interview. What are you
doing when you're not playing football?

382
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:46,371
Tell me something about yourself.

383
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:49,896
I play Madden on my Xbox or...

384
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:52,310
go swimming. Usually,
I'm just practicing and working out.

385
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,665
You need to bulk up some,

386
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:57,459
eat some chicken,
fried steak or something.

387
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,531
I'm not allowed to have fried food.
My dad says it's bad for me.

388
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:01,787
He does, uh?

389
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:05,389
I'm gonna watch you throw a few.

390
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:07,863
Nice and slow...

391
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:11,828
There you go.

392
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:16,435
Good job.

393
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,221
- Sit anywhere.
- Thank you.

394
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:34,771
- Can I get you something to drink?
- I'd love a coffee, thank you.

395
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,931
How you doing?

396
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:41,151
- Principal Taylor!
- Nice to see you.

397
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:43,528
I haven't seen you
since our interview this summer.

398
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:46,023
- I guess it was.
- That's right.

399
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,522
That's right.
Good.

400
00:24:47,642 --> 00:24:51,076
Actually, I was just finishing up here.
I have a meeting I need to get to.

401
00:24:51,353 --> 00:24:53,287
I'm looking forward
to our meeting this week.

402
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:54,407
So am I.

403
00:24:55,005 --> 00:24:57,584
Actually, now that I'm running into you,
there are a couple of things

404
00:24:57,795 --> 00:25:00,670
I would just love to go over with you
in a casual context.

405
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:02,422
Like I said, I have a meeting.

406
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,321
I'll make it real brief. I just wanna
make sure you had all the information

407
00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:08,930
in terms of what this Jumbo Tron money
could get us.

408
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,521
It could get us 2, maybe 3 of the
teachers that we lost since the lay off.

409
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:15,783
- This really isn't the proper time.
- Right, right.

410
00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:20,188
But I know that you've been talking
about it to Garrity on the golf course.

411
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:24,687
And so, I just wanna make sure
it's gonna be a fair conversation.

412
00:25:24,948 --> 00:25:27,332
There's no reason
to get angry about this, Tami.

413
00:25:27,452 --> 00:25:31,193
No, I'm not angry. I'm just dealing
with a school that's understaffed.

414
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,558
When I think about it that way,
it makes me angry.

415
00:25:33,678 --> 00:25:35,706
I mean, I'm not angry now,
but it's anger.

416
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:37,857
Look, Tami, you know...

417
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,245
I want more teachers, too.
And more supplies.

418
00:25:42,386 --> 00:25:45,479
But those people gave their money
for a Jumbo Tron.

419
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:49,887
I'll see you next week. I'm real
interested in what you have to say.

420
00:25:51,456 --> 00:25:52,681
It's not a big deal.

421
00:25:52,891 --> 00:25:55,462
You haven't seen your mom
since you were a little kid.

422
00:25:55,582 --> 00:25:58,096
I think that qualifies
as a big deal.

423
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,681
How did you feel when you saw her?

424
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,223
I don't know, man.
It was...

425
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,697
it was weird.

426
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:07,980
Are you gonna see each other again?

427
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,981
Why are you so obsessed with my mother?
How's your mother? Is she doing fine?

428
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:13,861
Hi, it's nice to see you.

429
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:18,206
So, are you ready for
hard things this midterm

430
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:21,201
Someone won't let me study.

431
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:23,461
I know. My mom is kinda
really obsessed about it.

432
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:27,457
She's determined that if I don't pass it
then my entire future is like corroded.

433
00:26:27,577 --> 00:26:30,753
So, do you maybe wanna...

434
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,699
Hi, Landry.

435
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:43,865
Cash, this is Landry.

436
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:45,400
Yeah, Landry. I'm Cash.

437
00:26:45,712 --> 00:26:47,722
Yeah, I know who you are.

438
00:26:52,715 --> 00:26:55,227
We're gonna have
a little conversation, first. OK?

439
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,542
- You all right?
- Yeah, it'll be like 2 min. Thank you.

440
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:06,676
I'm... I'm really starting to think
that by aunt...

441
00:27:08,198 --> 00:27:11,223
you actually meant Cash,
the rodeo guy.

442
00:27:11,473 --> 00:27:14,807
Is that? I'm starting to kinda
piece all this together, Tyra.

443
00:27:14,977 --> 00:27:17,153
- I'm sorry I lied to you.
- You did lie to me.

444
00:27:17,273 --> 00:27:19,041
You lied right to my face.

445
00:27:19,211 --> 00:27:22,221
I believed you about your aunt.
I felt bad for you.

446
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:24,022
I didn't wanna hurt you.

447
00:27:24,234 --> 00:27:27,685
I've been really, really stupid
for a really, really long time.

448
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,812
We broke up like 2 months ago.

449
00:27:30,073 --> 00:27:31,946
Tell me what's changed
since we've broke up.

450
00:27:32,463 --> 00:27:35,151
You still...
You still hold my hand.

451
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:38,110
I held your hand at <i>Cloverfield</i>.
It was a scary movie.

452
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,830
- You said I'm your best friend.
- That's the whole point.

453
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:44,253
- You cannot keep telling me this.
- Maybe I should've been clearer.

454
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:45,733
We're not together.

455
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:49,331
If you want to choose
a guy that rides horses...

456
00:27:49,592 --> 00:27:52,751
Yes, he rides horses,
and he drives a truck!

457
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:55,733
... with a big stupid cowboy hat,
then you just tell it to my face!

458
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:57,715
Yes, I'm choosing him!

459
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:04,096
Alright.
Well, thank you very much.

460
00:28:10,026 --> 00:28:13,522
- What are you doing all the day?
- I'm doing problem #2.

461
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,254
I think.

462
00:28:20,612 --> 00:28:22,114
Hey, surprise!

463
00:28:23,227 --> 00:28:24,737
What are you doing?

464
00:28:24,907 --> 00:28:27,377
I was at H-E-B and I saw a few things
I thought you might like.

465
00:28:28,327 --> 00:28:29,829
Vanilla creams, right?

466
00:28:30,563 --> 00:28:32,113
I'll be in my bedroom.

467
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:33,894
Here. Thanks.

468
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:36,337
Grandma?

469
00:28:37,337 --> 00:28:39,256
This... This is Julie.

470
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:42,593
- Hi, Julie, I'm Shelby, Matt's...
- My mom.

471
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:46,854
Hi, I'm Julie.
It's really nice to meet you.

472
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:48,682
Nice to meet you, Julie.

473
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,519
I found a few
of Matt's baby pictures.

474
00:28:52,726 --> 00:28:54,754
I thought, maybe Lorraine might like
to see them.

475
00:28:54,874 --> 00:28:56,148
Can I see them?

476
00:28:57,378 --> 00:28:58,794
You can't do this.

477
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,870
- Do what?
- You can't come in here

478
00:29:02,081 --> 00:29:05,164
with groceries and baby pictures
and act like everything is normal.

479
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:12,502
- I know I can't just...
- I don't need your help, okay?

480
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:16,444
I needed it 10 years ago
when you left... and 5 years ago.

481
00:29:16,564 --> 00:29:18,636
But I don't need it anymore.
I figured it out.

482
00:29:20,114 --> 00:29:21,114
So...

483
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:23,844
Thank you for taking my grandmother
to the doctor.

484
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:26,345
You wanted to help
and you helped, now...

485
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:29,765
please, go.

486
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:37,106
- Sweetheart, I didn't mean to...
- Don't call me that.

487
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:20,858
I'm an idiot.

488
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:25,212
- No, you're not.
- I should never have picked this fight.

489
00:30:26,014 --> 00:30:28,532
Yes, babe.
You should have.

490
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:31,290
Oh, honey.
You don't even mean that, I don't think.

491
00:30:31,504 --> 00:30:33,555
You thought it was a bad idea
the whole time.

492
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:35,762
That's not true.
I never said that.

493
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:37,641
That's not what I thought.

494
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:40,340
It's obvious that you're right
and they're wrong. Period.

495
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:42,921
Really?

496
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:45,219
You're damn right.
You think we need a Jumbo Tron?

497
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:47,688
- We don't need a Jumbo Tron.
- Of course not.

498
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,434
- We need more teachers.
- Of course we need them.

499
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,269
You're right.
They're wrong.

500
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:57,673
It doesn't matter, though,
cause I'm gonna loose tomorrow.

501
00:30:57,793 --> 00:30:58,896
Okay, yeah...

502
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:02,863
They gonna get the Jumbo Tron.
In that sense, you loose tomorrow.

503
00:31:04,469 --> 00:31:06,878
But you stood up
for what you believed in.

504
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,050
In that sense, you win tomorrow.

505
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:18,792
You can at least make them
feel a little bit guilty

506
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:21,200
about that big old
stupid Jumbo Tron.

507
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:25,965
Thank you, honey.

508
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:33,371
Look, Grandma...

509
00:31:35,715 --> 00:31:38,273
I'm sorry that I had her
drive you to the doctor the other day.

510
00:31:40,283 --> 00:31:42,736
It seemed like a good idea
at the time, and...

511
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,064
it turned out not to be.

512
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:48,695
So, I'm sorry.

513
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:51,931
Well, now...

514
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:54,998
I don't forgive her for what she did
and I still don't like her,

515
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,668
but your daddy is...

516
00:31:59,588 --> 00:32:01,750
He's very difficult.
We know that.

517
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,751
And you know, maybe...

518
00:32:05,435 --> 00:32:06,435
Shoot.

519
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:09,338
Maybe I could've helped her out

520
00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:11,640
a little bit more than I did.

521
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:14,518
What do you mean?

522
00:32:15,907 --> 00:32:18,026
I just mean what I said.
That's it.

523
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:20,482
Let's not have
a big old soap opera about it.

524
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,310
- Let's go watch some TV.
- All right.

525
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,752
Got your mouthpiece & cleats?

526
00:32:32,755 --> 00:32:35,490
You gotta remember
there's gonna be a different cadence.

527
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,481
- Gotta listen to the snap count.
- I got it!

528
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:40,885
Pay attention to the snap count.
Just saying you gotta listen.

529
00:32:43,152 --> 00:32:45,330
So, Mich Stallman,

530
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,421
he's a...
front office guy?

531
00:32:51,373 --> 00:32:52,384
Yes, he is.

532
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,054
I'm glad you called me.

533
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:15,626
How did you find me?

534
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:19,024
There's only 2 motels
in town, so...

535
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:23,355
Get you something?

536
00:33:23,555 --> 00:33:26,210
- Can I just get some water please?
- Thank you.

537
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,786
Thanks.

538
00:33:31,975 --> 00:33:33,909
Look, I know my dad is a jerk...

539
00:33:34,553 --> 00:33:37,048
and we're not living with him,
I know.

540
00:33:37,218 --> 00:33:40,003
He yells...
throws stuff.

541
00:33:43,163 --> 00:33:44,816
I guess that's why you left.

542
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:49,446
I'm not gonna say anything bad
about your dad, Matthew.

543
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,802
I mean, I was...

544
00:33:52,135 --> 00:33:54,194
17 when I got pregnant.

545
00:33:55,432 --> 00:33:57,939
I had only known him
a couple of months.

546
00:33:58,108 --> 00:33:59,164
I was just a kid.

547
00:34:00,436 --> 00:34:02,012
But, I will never...

548
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,472
never ever forgive myself
for leaving you.

549
00:34:06,507 --> 00:34:08,966
And God knows I don't expect you
to forgive me either.

550
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,316
Well, what do you want?

551
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:15,074
I mean...

552
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:18,340
Why are you here?

553
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:22,587
When you showed up,

554
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:25,295
at my door
with that paper from that lawyer,

555
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:28,787
and I found out
that your dad's in Iraq

556
00:34:28,907 --> 00:34:32,257
and you're taking care of Lorraine
all by yourself, I...

557
00:34:33,278 --> 00:34:34,557
I just thought...

558
00:34:36,162 --> 00:34:38,021
you're all alone in this.

559
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:39,955
It's too much.

560
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:42,625
I just felt...

561
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:44,447
like a deep...

562
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,212
I just felt bad.

563
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,382
And I'm not looking for you
to forgive me,

564
00:34:50,893 --> 00:34:53,093
I'm not looking for you
to call me mom,

565
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:57,092
but I just really would love
to stick around for a while,

566
00:34:57,353 --> 00:34:59,168
a few weeks or so...

567
00:35:00,104 --> 00:35:01,889
to see if I can lend a hand.

568
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,483
All right.

569
00:35:15,094 --> 00:35:16,094
All right.

570
00:35:21,628 --> 00:35:23,071
That's really great.

571
00:35:31,442 --> 00:35:32,442
Stand up.

572
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:38,221
We've been here an hour. How much
longer we're gonna have to wait?

573
00:35:46,864 --> 00:35:49,033
- Mitch, how you doing?
- Great, Coach. How are you?

574
00:35:49,153 --> 00:35:51,069
- Good, good to see you.
- Okay, so...

575
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,031
- Everything's good.
- Good.

576
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,859
I talked to Coach Helling, but the deal
is we gonna have to reschedule.

577
00:35:58,743 --> 00:36:01,412
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I am sorry, fellows, but...

578
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:04,290
this all Thursday night game
got schedule all screwed up...

579
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,585
But he said we can do it next weekend,
if you guys are available.

580
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,050
- Next weekend...
- Yes, sir.

581
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:12,916
Is that gonna work for you?

582
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:17,937
Follow me.

583
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:21,187
Hey, Vince!

584
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:25,812
- What the hell are you doing?
- Coach, I know you got practice,

585
00:36:26,023 --> 00:36:28,104
and I respect that.
But I gotta tell you something.

586
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:31,364
This kid right here
can flat out play.

587
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:33,569
He's fast, tough as hell,
he can read field better

588
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,170
than any player you got out here.
And let me tell you something else:

589
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,617
he's got more heart and guts
any kid I've ever coached.

590
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,280
You know what I'm talking about.

591
00:36:42,858 --> 00:36:45,943
You just ask yourself what you want,
you wanna pass it up on a chance.

592
00:36:46,063 --> 00:36:48,044
Take a look at him
cause I'll tell you what,

593
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,311
we drove a long way to get down here,
I don't know when we're gonna get back.

594
00:36:51,431 --> 00:36:54,950
Let me ask you something. If someone
pulled a stud when you were over TMU,

595
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,090
what do you think
Coach Boyd would have done?

596
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,263
He'd have said, "It's a guy with balls
and the courage of his convictions."

597
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:05,850
Then, he'd have looked me in the eyes
and said, "Now, get the hell off."

598
00:37:06,596 --> 00:37:08,346
You won't be disappointed.

599
00:37:13,755 --> 00:37:15,395
First unit, take a knee.

600
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:17,599
Listen to me.

601
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:20,740
You listen to me closer
you've ever listened to me before.

602
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,034
You remember that Rutledge game,
4th quarter?

603
00:37:23,248 --> 00:37:25,574
You came into that game,
you took over that game.

604
00:37:25,694 --> 00:37:28,075
Play by play, you owned that game!

605
00:37:28,486 --> 00:37:31,586
I watched you, and I said to myself,
"That kid is gonna go all the way."

606
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:35,534
Right now, right here,

607
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:38,544
God has placed you to do
what you do best.

608
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:43,054
Go all the way.

609
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,611
Which knee did he bust up?
I couldn't tell.

610
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:35,965
Exactly.

611
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:41,926
What do you think, Coach?

612
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,076
I wouldn't go busting
up the bubble just yet.

613
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,648
We'll call you.

614
00:39:00,443 --> 00:39:01,993
So, we good with this?

615
00:39:02,804 --> 00:39:05,880
- You ready to start this thing?
- We're ready, Coach.

616
00:39:06,141 --> 00:39:07,491
So, send them in.

617
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:12,958
Get in here.

618
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:16,111
Alright, let's go, fellows.

619
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,173
We're gonna shake things up
on Friday night.

620
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,147
Matt, you gonna start.

621
00:39:22,602 --> 00:39:25,016
You're also gonna play,
we're gonna rotate series.

622
00:39:25,136 --> 00:39:28,258
You'll get an equal time out there.
Understood?

623
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,128
This is my decision.

624
00:39:31,248 --> 00:39:34,041
I'm making this cause I think
it's gonna help us win the game.

625
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:36,876
Matt, where you're out there,
we're gonna run the I, J.D, the spread.

626
00:39:37,296 --> 00:39:38,762
Is that understood?

627
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,970
It's a unorthodox,
the way we like things around here.

628
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,011
But it won't work
if McNaulty knows about it,

629
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:48,806
so you all gonna have to ride herd
over the team. Is that understood?

630
00:39:50,414 --> 00:39:51,267
Yes, sir.

631
00:39:51,626 --> 00:39:54,687
It's gonna be a long, hard week
of practice. You bring your A games.

632
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:00,026
See ya out there.

633
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,235
Your mamma let me in.

634
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,623
Look, I know you don't
wanna talk to me.

635
00:40:44,301 --> 00:40:45,624
Landry, I have...

636
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:51,183
I've never been closer to any guy
like I've been to you.

637
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,257
Ever.

638
00:40:56,084 --> 00:40:58,334
And what we had really was special.

639
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:05,494
And I stopped
feeling that way for you.

640
00:41:07,826 --> 00:41:09,413
You're my best friend...

641
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:18,010
Landry, I won't give
up your friendship.

642
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:20,578
Not without a fight.

643
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,328
Just please leave.

644
00:41:24,445 --> 00:41:26,197
Look, Tyra, I'm embarrassed.

645
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,985
Please, leave.

646
00:41:42,778 --> 00:41:45,818
First, we want to thank the boosters,
the wives and all the supporters

647
00:41:45,938 --> 00:41:47,715
for all their time and efforts.

648
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:50,261
I would now like to bring up
Principal Tami Taylor,

649
00:41:50,471 --> 00:41:52,179
for our final introduction.

650
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,845
Hi, all.
Thank you.

651
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,984
Well, Dillon Panthers' fans,
I've got two words for you:

652
00:42:05,286 --> 00:42:06,609
Jumbo Tron.

653
00:42:11,993 --> 00:42:14,479
Of course, I know
that's really only one word,

654
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,121
but I wanted to quote
our friend Buddy Garrity over there,

655
00:42:17,332 --> 00:42:19,915
it's because of him
that we have all this excitement today.

656
00:42:22,824 --> 00:42:25,372
I would also like to thank
Buddy Garrity

657
00:42:25,632 --> 00:42:29,167
for his generous offer
to house the PTA's

658
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:31,920
winter selling auction
at Garrity Motors.

659
00:42:35,664 --> 00:42:38,176
So you all keep your
eyes out for that!

660
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:48,444
Hello?

661
00:42:51,423 --> 00:42:52,907
Yes, sir, this is Brian.

662
00:42:58,587 --> 00:42:59,587
Yes, sir.

663
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:01,999
Tomorrow morning?
I'll be there.

664
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:08,465
It's just... my new shoulder pads
gonna be ready in the morning.

665
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:11,394
Lord, you know
what I thought that was.

666
00:43:11,564 --> 00:43:13,282
I've been holding my breath.

667
00:43:13,402 --> 00:43:14,995
No, I'm just playing.

668
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:19,091
I got in.

669
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:22,019
What did you just say, Brian?

670
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:24,689
I'm going to college, mom.

671
00:43:37,402 --> 00:43:38,503
He got in!

672
00:43:39,164 --> 00:43:40,830
Your brother is going to college!

673
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,260
Coach Helling called.

674
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,303
I'm in.

675
00:43:59,073 --> 00:44:00,100
Is that right?

676
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,143
He wants me
to practice in the morning.

677
00:44:02,354 --> 00:44:04,866
I'm leaving tonight,
the guys are driving me.

678
00:44:05,036 --> 00:44:07,586
I just figured to stop by,
before I left.

679
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:12,484
- You get your playbook?
- It's in the car.

680
00:44:12,654 --> 00:44:14,928
Remember what I told you
about those dorm rooms?

681
00:44:15,048 --> 00:44:17,783
They're nothing but trouble.
You better not be skipping any classes.

682
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:20,068
Keep your grades up.
Let me keep an eye on it.

683
00:44:20,188 --> 00:44:21,662
I want you to keep an eye on it.

684
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,686
I wanted to stop by...

685
00:44:26,693 --> 00:44:27,918
and say thank you...

686
00:44:29,983 --> 00:44:31,249
You know...

687
00:44:32,784 --> 00:44:34,034
for everything.

688
00:44:36,363 --> 00:44:39,113
I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

689
00:44:40,419 --> 00:44:41,599
And that's for real.

690
00:44:55,855 --> 00:44:57,898
- Hit the fan.
- You got it.

691
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:02,738
I want from you tickets 50 yard line
and some parking passes.

692
00:45:03,462 --> 00:45:05,715
- You got it!
- One more stop to make, Williams.

693
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:06,957
Oh, no beer on 3.

694
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,377
What?

695
00:45:15,381 --> 00:45:17,295
- Hey ya'll, first 5 yards.
- Mississipi.

696
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:18,344
Don't forget!

697
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,213
Ready?

698
00:45:20,455 --> 00:45:24,258
- Alright, settle.
- Let's call something.

699
00:45:25,826 --> 00:45:28,771
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi, game over!

700
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,197
Alright!

701
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:38,367
Where are you at, baby?

702
00:45:41,007 --> 00:45:42,309
Where are you at?

703
00:46:30,717 --> 00:46:32,710
My job's to fill the team
to win games.

704
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,660
How did you win State championship?
I worked my ass off to practice!

705
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,464
I do everything that you say!

706
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:43,547
I'm moving back east
with my parents. I have to.

707
00:46:43,998 --> 00:46:46,098
You can come visit.
He's your son too.

708
00:46:46,715 --> 00:46:49,268
I called you a dumb ass,
wild trash, redneck...

709
00:46:51,564 --> 00:46:53,080
Go in the truck!

710
00:46:53,817 --> 00:46:55,141
Go, go, go!
