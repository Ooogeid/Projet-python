1
00:00:00,518 --> 00:00:02,705
Kissing you was great.

2
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:04,721
There's this part of me

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:07,190
that's still hung up
on this other girl...

4
00:00:08,994 --> 00:00:10,526
Touchdown, East scores!

5
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:12,662
The Lions may have found
a quarterback

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,582
that is the real deal.

7
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:17,333
Maybe I should have left already.
Do you even want me to stay?

8
00:00:17,548 --> 00:00:19,335
Of course I want you to stay!

9
00:00:19,504 --> 00:00:22,005
He's leaving.
He's really leaving.

10
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:46,963
I'm trying to hear
if she's still crying.

11
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:48,629
Take her.

12
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:51,934
- He'll call eventually.
- He hasn't called yet.

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,239
- You want some coffee?
- Yes, please.

14
00:00:57,379 --> 00:00:58,479
Hi, sweetie.

15
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:01,935
How you doing?

16
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,188
Fine.

17
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,565
Go, cattle. Go, cattle!

18
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,778
- We'll be all right, Maggie.
- Yep! Get up, cow!

19
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:14,657
They can't get out,
they can't get stolen.

20
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,659
What idiot would steal these cows?

21
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:18,761
- Cow rustlers.
- Cow rustlers?

22
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:20,630
What is this, the wild west?

23
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:23,466
- This sucks.
- Don't say sucks. Have a vocabulary.

24
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:25,117
I'm sorry, mom.

25
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:27,670
Luke and I'll get that fence fixed.
We'll be fine.

26
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,681
Luke, you'd best plan on missing
some school this week.

27
00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:34,177
You want me to miss school for a week
'cause some idiot stole our cows, dad?

28
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,612
I got to go to school.
If I don't, they won't let me practice.

29
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:40,483
We got a huge game coming up.
I got to practice, we can win this game.

30
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:43,786
I'd hire someone if I could, Luke.
We don't have any money...

31
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:46,108
What do you want me to say?

32
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,629
Wait, shh, shh.

33
00:01:53,963 --> 00:01:54,964
What's going on?

34
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:57,867
Nothing is going on,
except for the fact that you won us

35
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,869
a blue ribbon award
for academic excellence!

36
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:04,840
- Congratulations, Tami.
- Take a look!

37
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,044
Tami, one year as principal,
and you got Dillon

38
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,467
- the blue ribbon award. Incredible.
- Dillon High is a blue ribbon school.

39
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:14,717
This is great news!

40
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:17,720
- How about that?
- It's yours!

41
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,789
He's here!

42
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:24,727
Daddy!

43
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:29,465
He's cute!

44
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:34,751
- I missed you.
- Look at you! Look the hell at you!

45
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:37,573
- Stop growing up!
- There's not much I can do about that.

46
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:41,844
Put your stuff in the guest room.
I rented out the airstream.

47
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:45,540
- You all set? You got to go to school.
- I drove all night. I'll take her.

48
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,084
Well, we got all her stuff ready.
Go settle in, you'll see her later.

49
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,520
- All right. Bye, bye.
- Bye.

50
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:56,009
How you doing?

51
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,541
- You're the renter?
- I am, yeah.

52
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,646
I'm Tim, by the way.

53
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:05,668
Nice to meet you.

54
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:13,943
Let's go, bring it in!

55
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:15,855
Come on, let's go.

56
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:18,065
Hey, listen now.

57
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:20,147
Campo Park...

58
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:21,778
two weeks.

59
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:24,386
This is a game we are gonna win.

60
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:26,689
And we're gonna be going
into this game

61
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:28,507
a little bit different.

62
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:35,264
You've got about 30 seconds

63
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:38,200
before this gentleman puts on
that uniform and get some licks on him,

64
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:41,037
'cause you're looking
at our new quarterback.

65
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:46,876
Let's get it together.
We got work to do!

66
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:51,558
4x07: IN THE BAG

67
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:58,587
Subtitles: Team Lions
With the participation of:

68
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:02,124
Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, GillesSilb,
Jenn, Ju, Loky, Nam, Ouazo

69
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:39,795
Julie may I ask...

70
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:43,984
why you are signing up
for every club that is available?

71
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:45,365
'Cause I can.

72
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,470
You're really signing up
for the school beautification committee?

73
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,740
And you're signing up for the book club,
which would normally be fine,

74
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:54,476
except for this week's book
is <i>Twilight.</i>

75
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,478
Just leave me alone, okay?

76
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,673
You do realize that he was
my best friend too, you know?

77
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:03,986
Yep. And that's why I signed you up
for the academic smackdown.

78
00:05:04,363 --> 00:05:07,030
- What is that?
- It's like quiz bowl.

79
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:09,358
It's after school.
I'll see you in the cafeteria.

80
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:13,262
Right. Well, I...

81
00:05:13,742 --> 00:05:15,731
Yeah. We got the invoice
two days ago.

82
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:19,701
Well, I can't pay the invoice a week ago
if I just got it two days ago.

83
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:21,904
Hang on one second, would you, please?
Come here.

84
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:26,675
You were absent today, you can't go
to practice. You got a good excuse?

85
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:28,710
Yes, sir. My dad's making me fix
our fence.

86
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,113
You have to fix a fence?
Are you kidding with me?

87
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:33,749
We don't have any money.
We can't hire nobody.

88
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,952
Can I tell you something?
We need you, you understand that?

89
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,622
You're absent, you can't practice.
You can't practice, you're not playing.

90
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:42,924
So here's what you need to do.
Fix your fence.

91
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,460
In the middle of the night,
I don't care, or in the morning,

92
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:48,486
before you come to school,
but you make it to school on time.

93
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:50,365
You get here on time,
you go to practice.

94
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:52,490
- Okay.
- Good. I'll see you tomorrow.

95
00:05:52,615 --> 00:05:54,215
Don't be absent again.

96
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:55,726
Go.

97
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:57,468
You there?

98
00:05:57,593 --> 00:06:00,308
Yeah, listen, we just got
the invoice, though.

99
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,046
Let move that piece already!

100
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:05,347
Calm down!

101
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,872
- What?
- I got a buck.

102
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,553
Sorry... funding right now.
Billy, I need more money.

103
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,089
- One sec.
- God, the baby's... baby on board.

104
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:15,737
$1.75...

105
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,260
- It's that simple.
- I got it, 37 cents...

106
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,896
Oh, god!
No, please stop.

107
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:22,998
- Calm down! What is wrong?
- Contraction.

108
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:26,001
- Still not there? What?
- Contraction!

109
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:27,836
You're 7 months pregnant...

110
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:30,071
- Please go to the hospital.
- We got food there...

111
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
Oh, god!
Please go!

112
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:33,945
- Get the food.
- Oh, god!

113
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,010
Thanks.

114
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,112
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Sorry...

115
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,184
- Baby, you okay?
- Oh, god!

116
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:44,922
Do you have any idea
what kind of losers

117
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:47,297
are gonna be at academic smackdown?

118
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:50,325
You realize the irony
behind the term academic smackdown?

119
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,793
Shut up, Landry.

120
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:01,603
- Goody...
- Is this one taken here?

121
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:07,309
Fancy seeing you here.

122
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:10,836
This isn't gonna be awkward
or anything, is it?

123
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:13,782
Well, if it's gonna be
awkward for you, you can leave.

124
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:15,650
I do this smackdown

125
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:18,849
every single year, so you being here
is of no consequence to me.

126
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:25,160
Welcome to East Dillon
academic smackdown team...

127
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:28,271
who have an event this weekend

128
00:07:28,544 --> 00:07:30,492
against another school
in our district

129
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,363
at West Dillon, our sister school,

130
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:36,204
our blue ribbon sister school.

131
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:38,707
I need you to perform well at this.

132
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,226
All right, study.

133
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:42,331
This is exciting.

134
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,262
Learning...

135
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:50,819
Your mom is gonna kill me!

136
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,481
Well, what's she gonna do,
divorce you?

137
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,824
Oh, wait.
She already did that.

138
00:07:56,805 --> 00:08:00,028
- A dog's a lot of work, Beck.
- I know.

139
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,898
I can do it. Besides, I get
really lonely when mom's at work.

140
00:08:06,796 --> 00:08:08,503
Do you ever think
you're gonna move home?

141
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:12,277
I mean, I know you and mom
aren't gonna get back together, but...

142
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:14,375
if you lived in town,
we could see more.

143
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,279
Give me a little time, all right?
I'm working on it.

144
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:21,058
Puppies!

145
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:22,897
I like this one.

146
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:29,148
He's gonna do 50 sit-ups in 30 seconds.
Hit the floor. Let's go.

147
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:30,959
- You're challenging me.
- Yeah.

148
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:32,847
You ready, Coach?

149
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:34,129
Go!

150
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:51,212
Hey, Levi...

151
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,317
- Gentlemen?
- We need to see Vincent Howard.

152
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,889
- What's going on?
- We got a report that

153
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:02,664
he had a gun on school grounds. These
officers need to search his locker.

154
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:03,789
Report from who?

155
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:05,593
We need to check the locker.

156
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,464
Well, look, maybe we should...
clear something...

157
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,898
The police are here.

158
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:13,662
Go.

159
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,703
Second one on the end.

160
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:24,041
It's got a name on it.

161
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:58,568
- It's clean.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

162
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:00,507
I'll meet you in front.

163
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:20,527
- All right, dad, I'll be back later.
- Where you going?

164
00:10:20,742 --> 00:10:22,003
I'm going to school, dad.

165
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:24,103
Luke, get back here.

166
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:26,574
Dad, I cannot miss practice.

167
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:28,358
I cannot miss school.
I'll build it,

168
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:31,345
I'll stay up till midnight, I'll get up
at dawn, but I'm going to school.

169
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:35,249
Luke, you get your ass
back here now!

170
00:10:35,557 --> 00:10:37,257
I'll be back later, dad.

171
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:43,788
I want to admit you
to the hospital overnight.

172
00:10:43,913 --> 00:10:47,412
She needs to be on the magnesium
sulfate for at least 24 hours.

173
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,447
Everything's gonna be okay, right?
I mean...

174
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:51,399
the baby and everything.
She's gonna be fine?

175
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,768
It should be, but she's going
to need to go on bed rest.

176
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,870
Okay, um...

177
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:59,206
- For how long?
- 2 months. Until the baby's full-term.

178
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:00,908
I'll check back later.

179
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:03,878
Oh, my god.

180
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:07,225
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?

181
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,426
You aren't gonna have to do anything.
Me and Tim will take care of everything.

182
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:13,174
You won't have to lift
a finger, all right?

183
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:15,348
Uh, doc?

184
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:20,394
Look, I don't exactly have
insurance right now.

185
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:24,365
I mean, I was... I was gonna pay
for the birth out of pocket, but...

186
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:27,219
I wasn't exactly expecting it
to cost this much.

187
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:28,844
Is there anything...

188
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:32,606
we might be able to work out
or some kind of deal or...?

189
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,200
You know, it...
It costs what it costs.

190
00:11:36,332 --> 00:11:38,799
There are payment plans,
but still...

191
00:11:39,596 --> 00:11:41,926
The contractions are waning.
You can take her home

192
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:44,329
and keep her on her side
and well-hydrated...

193
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,720
It may be enough.

194
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:50,658
Then, we'll keep her here overnight.

195
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:55,229
Premature labor is something that
usually happens more than once, okay?

196
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:56,906
Yeah...

197
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:03,241
What am I supposed to do?
It's not like I've much of a choice.

198
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:05,773
No... I mean, I guess not.
I mean, I don't know.

199
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,099
You know,
if they'd come in saying...

200
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:10,811
open up Landry's locker,
would you have just done that?

201
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:12,718
I don't know
what I would have done then.

202
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:15,816
I think the real question is
do you think that he has a gun?

203
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:19,353
- Well, I sure as hell hope not.
- But do you think it's possible?

204
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,286
I-I don't know, honey.
Anything's possible, isn't it?

205
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:26,126
Seems like maybe
you ought to just ask him.

206
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:29,769
I mean, he's never gonna trust
you unless you trust him, you know?

207
00:12:32,906 --> 00:12:33,906
Okay.

208
00:12:34,782 --> 00:12:36,437
What year was the battle
of Stalingrad?

209
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:39,273
- 19... 1941.
- Wrong.

210
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:41,583
- 1942.
- Thank you.

211
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,311
Can you lighten up?
Jeez, you're making me go blank.

212
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,880
I'm making you go blank?
How do you think you're gonna feel

213
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:49,116
when you're having to answer
these questions in front

214
00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:51,185
of all those people?
You're gonna...

215
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,656
Hey, come here.

216
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:55,055
These are very basic questions
I'm asking right now.

217
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,692
What? He knows nothing
about World War II!

218
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,694
- Hey, hey. Come here, come here.
- What?

219
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:03,154
Just take a deep breath, okay?

220
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,700
I understand that you're going through
a lot, that you're in a lot of pain...

221
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:10,704
This has nothing to do with Matt.
I want to do well on the smackdown, OK?

222
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,559
- You know what? Just climb off my back.
- You're lying, it's about Matt.

223
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:16,123
- It's not about Matt.
- Deal with the fact that...

224
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:23,781
Come here.

225
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:28,281
Close the door.

226
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:32,282
- Sit down.
- What's up?

227
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:39,415
How you doing?

228
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
I'm good.

229
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,453
A little sore, but I'm good.

230
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:46,707
I got to ask you a question.

231
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:54,114
You got a gun?

232
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,548
I'm just asking you straight up.

233
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,088
Have you got a gun?

234
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,923
Do you have gun, do you carry a gun,

235
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:05,505
do you have a gun in your locker...
I don't know, a gun.

236
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,294
Give me an answer.
Talk to me.

237
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:15,051
No, I ain't got no gun.

238
00:14:20,088 --> 00:14:21,775
That's all I wanted to know.

239
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:28,201
I don't know.
Do the swaddle-and-shush thing.

240
00:14:29,338 --> 00:14:32,024
Babe, I don't know.
I'm not a friggin' midwife.

241
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:33,543
So I don't know.

242
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:36,924
I'll be home in a few days, all right?
Then I'm yours.

243
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:39,696
Yeah, yours and the baby's.
All right.

244
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,323
Love... love you back.

245
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,098
Trouble at home, huh?

246
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:51,505
Becky says you were some kind of big
football deal around here. Is that it?

247
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:53,340
Something like that.

248
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:55,575
Yeah. I bet that was
pretty good times, huh?

249
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:57,411
Yeah, it had its moments.

250
00:14:57,775 --> 00:15:00,381
You're young yet.
It'll change, believe me.

251
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:02,817
- You're not married, are you?
- No.

252
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:05,485
Don't ever get married,
don't ever have kids.

253
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:08,151
You don't like your kids?

254
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:10,540
No, I love my kids.

255
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,326
It's just that it... it never ends.

256
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,795
Right. I mean...

257
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:16,496
A baby and all,

258
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:18,395
I'm sure it's a lot.

259
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:21,968
All right, look,

260
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,538
I got a baby
with this girl in Seattle.

261
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:26,606
You know how it goes, right?

262
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,510
Now she wants to get married...
There's just never enough to go around.

263
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:33,428
Yeah. You're spreading
yourself pretty thin.

264
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:35,882
- Becky know about Seattle?
- Oh, no, no.

265
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,850
And I don't want her to.

266
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,720
It was a present!

267
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:43,256
Forget it!
I'm walking!

268
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:45,225
I'm not going anywhere with you!

269
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:47,027
You are being ridiculous.

270
00:15:47,195 --> 00:15:50,440
You've got one hell of a nerve bringing
that dog in here without asking.

271
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:52,599
There's nothing wrong
with her having a little dog.

272
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,894
Julie.

273
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:23,730
- Julie Taylor.
- Hey, Mrs. Saracen.

274
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,999
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Come in here, sweetie.

275
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:30,146
Shelby, look who's here.
It's Julie.

276
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:32,073
It's so good to see you.

277
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:34,012
- How you doing?
- Good.

278
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:37,711
Well, we're doing just fine, honey.
Shelby here,

279
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,601
she's taking real good care of me.

280
00:16:39,726 --> 00:16:41,076
Well, I'm trying.

281
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,083
That's good to hear.

282
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:46,620
I'm sure this whole Matt thing
must be so hard on you.

283
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:49,359
Lord, Julie, at first...

284
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,124
it was just awful.

285
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:53,460
But, you know,
now that I know he's fine,

286
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,840
then I'm fine.

287
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,164
You talked to Matt?

288
00:16:58,332 --> 00:17:01,735
Yeah. He even called again yesterday,
and let us know he got the place.

289
00:17:02,178 --> 00:17:03,778
He told you, I'm sure.

290
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,710
Yeah, he did.

291
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,514
Well, you know what?

292
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:12,612
We were just about to have an ice cream
sandwich. Let me get you one.

293
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,683
He's just going through
a lot, you know?

294
00:17:17,322 --> 00:17:19,622
He'll call.
He'll be in touch soon.

295
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:40,740
You're broke, I'm broke...
We got to sell something.

296
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:43,443
What do we have to sell?
We don't have anything besides Kit Kat.

297
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:46,980
No, we're not selling Kit Kat.
He's the face of Riggins' Rigs.

298
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:48,281
You're right.

299
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:50,005
I love that damn cow.

300
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,985
Cheers, boys.
Couple beers on me.

301
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,072
- Thank you.
- How's my girl doing?

302
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:56,076
She's doing good.
She's doing better.

303
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:59,993
Her mom's taking care of her right now,
give Tim and I a break from the...

304
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:02,662
- ringing of the bell every 5 seconds.
- That bell...

305
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,883
What? I don't want her
to stress out about things.

306
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,468
Me and the girls been talking,
and we wanna throw Mindy a baby shower.

307
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:11,771
- Sweet, that's great.
- But we also wanna tie in a fundraiser.

308
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:13,473
Make it a co-ed shower,

309
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:15,406
girls dance and whatnot,

310
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,844
guys pay admission and whatnot.

311
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:22,448
All the proceeds go to help Mindy,
baby, and all the medical bills.

312
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:25,451
Yeah.
No, I-I like this.

313
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:27,795
Mindy and I have been friends
since she was 17, okay?

314
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,989
She's like a sister to me.
I want to do this.

315
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:32,325
Where...
where would we do it, though?

316
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:35,578
- Your place isn't big enough?
- Not for something like this.

317
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:37,997
No, he can't host it.
He lives in a trailer.

318
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:43,803
- What about...?
- Riggins' Rigs.

319
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,906
That may be the smartest thing
you've ever said in your entire life.

320
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:48,508
- Could work.
- Riggins' Rigs.

321
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:51,010
Sounds like a plan, okay?
Enjoy the beers.

322
00:18:51,178 --> 00:18:52,578
Thank you.
Great call.

323
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:54,313
- Thank you, Hannah!
- Yeah.

324
00:18:55,174 --> 00:18:58,663
What about Stephen Crane? Does anybody
need to read Stephen Crane anymore?

325
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:02,088
I think we can do without Stephen Crane,
go on to something a little fresher.

326
00:19:02,764 --> 00:19:05,858
Did you, uh, get a chance
to go out and celebrate, last night?

327
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:09,804
Well, we kind of did.

328
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:12,098
- Kind of?
- We had a little dinner last night.

329
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:14,400
There's a lot going on
in my house at the moment,

330
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:15,668
so it was...

331
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,036
sort of a celebration.

332
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:20,606
Well, this is kind of a big deal.
You know, you ought to take a night

333
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:23,310
for yourself, go out,
you know, cut it loose.

334
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:25,845
How about this?
What would you think

335
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:28,432
if I got a group
of the teachers together,

336
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:30,883
some of the staff,
and all of us together, we went out,

337
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:34,249
and we celebrated you
and your accomplishment?

338
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,889
I think that would be so much fun.
It doesn't have to be about me.

339
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:40,193
It's about celebrating everybody.
I think that's a great idea.

340
00:19:40,361 --> 00:19:43,333
How about this...
you, me, the staff...

341
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,297
Karaoke?

342
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:46,465
Let's do it.

343
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:05,108
Hey, man.

344
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:07,420
What's going on, man?
You dead or something?

345
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:12,058
Doing this whole drunk-out wino thing
gonna get you nowhere with the ladies.

346
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:13,982
No, I was just up all night.

347
00:20:14,107 --> 00:20:16,162
Probably gonna be up all night
every night this week.

348
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:17,730
What the hell was you doing?

349
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:21,232
Got to rebuild the entire fence
at the ranch. Some idiot's been

350
00:20:21,357 --> 00:20:22,568
stealing all the cows.

351
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:26,429
Maybe I can ask the team. Maybe some
of us come out and give you a hand.

352
00:20:26,554 --> 00:20:28,369
Right.
You think they'd do that?

353
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,409
Man, I'll ask.
It don't hurt to ask, dude.

354
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:32,795
All right, you do that, and...

355
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,981
I'll just be here
sleeping, all right?

356
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:36,917
Okay, cool.

357
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:40,953
Damn.
These are pretty good fries.

358
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,291
Thank you.

359
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:50,496
- Can I help you?
- I'm Vincent's mother...

360
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:51,864
Regina.

361
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,599
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

362
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:55,163
How are you?

363
00:20:55,676 --> 00:20:56,676
I'm well.

364
00:20:57,238 --> 00:21:00,038
I'm afraid the last time
you saw me, I was...

365
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:02,041
in not such good shape.

366
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,176
Well, I'm working on it.

367
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:05,401
That's good.

368
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:11,105
I just wanted to come by
and say thank you...

369
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,221
Thank you for making my son
quarterback.

370
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:20,326
You know, things like that
ain't supposed to happen to us.

371
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,350
We don't get a lot of good breaks.

372
00:21:23,737 --> 00:21:26,165
You should have seen
the look on his face

373
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,026
when he told me...

374
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:31,837
It was like he was a kid again.

375
00:21:32,894 --> 00:21:35,794
I haven't seen that face
in a really long time.

376
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:38,410
I didn't give it to him.
He earned it.

377
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:41,003
I thank you...

378
00:21:41,404 --> 00:21:43,492
for believing in my boy.

379
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,660
He's a good kid.

380
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:47,469
You're welcome.

381
00:22:08,103 --> 00:22:08,907
Nice.

382
00:22:09,256 --> 00:22:11,777
That was great!
I can't believe that!

383
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:13,986
Have some shots
coming to the table, folks.

384
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:16,215
Pass them around, pass them around.

385
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:18,017
- Who ordered shots?
- I ordered.

386
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,185
Everybody's taking a taxi home.
That's it.

387
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,679
- Thank you, Glenn.
- Thank you!

388
00:22:22,804 --> 00:22:25,421
So I, uh...
I would like to propose a toast.

389
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:27,893
I think we've all been
at Dillon for a while now,

390
00:22:28,062 --> 00:22:31,363
and I think most of us know
what it was like before Tami got here.

391
00:22:31,531 --> 00:22:33,599
- Yeah, it sucked.
- It did suck.

392
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:38,137
But what matters most is that we know
what it's like now that you're here.

393
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,740
- To a job well done.
- Always smart, always professional.

394
00:22:42,004 --> 00:22:43,042
That's right,

395
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,812
you get the job done every time,
in spite of all of that political crap

396
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:49,715
and that football stuff
and just the district and everything.

397
00:22:49,883 --> 00:22:53,218
No, I mean, it's... It's really meant
a lot to us and to me.

398
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:54,720
To our fearless leader.

399
00:22:54,888 --> 00:22:57,490
Well, to all of y'all.
To everybody.

400
00:22:57,615 --> 00:22:58,757
Congratulations!

401
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:01,427
- Well done. Cheers, y'all.
- Cheers.

402
00:23:37,335 --> 00:23:40,385
- When do you think the cabs come?
- I don't know.

403
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:42,661
They'll be here in a minute.

404
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:46,118
That was...
pretty awesome, wasn't it?

405
00:23:46,243 --> 00:23:48,045
That was really fun.

406
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,310
We should do it more often, you know?
We should do it all the time.

407
00:23:51,478 --> 00:23:54,780
I don't know if you'll feel that way
when you wake up with your head banging.

408
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:58,216
Be totally worth it. I wanted you
to have a good night, you know?

409
00:23:58,385 --> 00:23:59,818
You're so sweet.
Thank you.

410
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:02,788
Well, there you go.

411
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:04,730
Oh, here's a cab.
Great, great. All right.

412
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:07,225
You go ahead.
I'll, um, wait for the next one.

413
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,661
I'm gonna take you up
'cause you're a gentleman.

414
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,685
All right, thank you, that was...

415
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,400
It was such a... such a fun thing, and
it was good for everybody, I thought.

416
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:17,235
You're the best, Tami.

417
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:18,472
Thank you.

418
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:25,977
I'm so sorry.

419
00:24:26,272 --> 00:24:28,647
- No, it's okay, I...
- No, it's...

420
00:24:29,255 --> 00:24:30,882
You get yourself home safe, okay?

421
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,251
I'll see... I'll see you
at school, all right?

422
00:24:50,144 --> 00:24:51,494
Why are you here?

423
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:53,726
How you doing?

424
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:01,484
You like being quarterback?

425
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,951
Quarterback's a leader.
Quarterback makes decisions,

426
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,319
makes choices.

427
00:25:07,691 --> 00:25:11,360
Quarterback has got to be clear
on what has got to be done.

428
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:14,092
You've got to make a decision.

429
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:17,562
Why do you care
about what I do so much?

430
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,670
What you getting out of this?

431
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:23,468
Ain't I just another player
that can throw the ball and run fast?

432
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:27,239
If I break my ankle and can't play,
you still gonna come around here?

433
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:29,593
You still gonna check up on me?

434
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,339
This is my life.

435
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,065
I been living here ten years

436
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:38,817
and seen three of my best friends
get killed walking to school.

437
00:25:40,227 --> 00:25:41,911
When I leave your practice,

438
00:25:42,036 --> 00:25:44,923
I'm the one looking over my shoulder,
hoping I don't get jumped,

439
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:46,545
robbed, killed...

440
00:25:51,225 --> 00:25:54,232
You get any more trouble with the law,
you're going straight to juvie.

441
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:57,026
Who puts the food up there
on the table?

442
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,533
Who makes sure the bills get paid?

443
00:26:03,848 --> 00:26:06,344
Who's gonna take care of that
if you're locked up?

444
00:26:08,853 --> 00:26:10,303
I'm offering you...

445
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:13,101
everything I got.

446
00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:16,299
This is not just about football.

447
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:20,544
Think about that.

448
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,801
I beg of you,
think about what I just said.

449
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:44,973
<i>Welcome to
the 2009 academic smackdown.</i>

450
00:26:45,098 --> 00:26:46,184
<i>Testing, testing.</i>

451
00:26:46,683 --> 00:26:47,685
Hi, Glenn.

452
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,826
- How you doing today?
- Good. Good, good, good.

453
00:26:55,122 --> 00:26:56,322
Almost set up.

454
00:26:57,978 --> 00:26:59,330
How you feeling today?

455
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:05,491
I feel like the...

456
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:07,338
like the biggest idiot
that ever lived.

457
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:09,407
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

458
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:12,798
I mean, I-I-I practically
raped you, you know?

459
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,712
- No, you didn't.
- Well, no, I mean, not...

460
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,549
not literally, but with my mouth...
It's like I mouth-raped you.

461
00:27:17,717 --> 00:27:19,417
- No.
- I can't believe I did that.

462
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:22,160
I mean, I'm Mr. Liberal,
you know? I grab...

463
00:27:22,988 --> 00:27:25,857
a beautiful married woman,
and I-I-I kiss her

464
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:27,387
like I'm some sort of,

465
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,112
you know, Neanderthal,

466
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:33,319
unevolved caveman or something,
and I am not that type of person.

467
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,167
- I'm not somebody who does that.
- I know. Glenn, I know.

468
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:39,037
I don't want you to beat
yourself up about it.

469
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:42,658
You did such a nice thing for all of us
last night, for me and for everybody,

470
00:27:42,783 --> 00:27:46,277
and it was such a nice party
that you planned, and...

471
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:47,795
That last part...

472
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:50,748
can't ever happen again, that's all.

473
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,880
<i>Okay, this is for East Dillon High.</i>

474
00:29:04,305 --> 00:29:06,290
<i>Name the first novel

475
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,704
<i>by the mid-century American novelist

00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:15,431
<i>of the wanderer.</i>

478
00:29:18,672 --> 00:29:19,772
I know this.

479
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:23,441
<i>Anyone want to take this?</i>

480
00:29:29,354 --> 00:29:30,404
<i>Here we go.</i>

481
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:36,874
<i>The first and last novel</i>

482
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:40,191

Look homeward, Angel<i>,</i>

487
00:29:55,404 --> 00:29:56,904
<i>and the second is...</i>

488
00:29:57,925 --> 00:29:59,625
You can't go home again.

489
00:30:04,363 --> 00:30:05,661
<i>That is correct.</i>

490
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:08,769
<i>East Dillon takes the lead.</i>

491
00:30:10,838 --> 00:30:12,023
<i>Now for Remington High.</i>

492
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:15,586
Take a break.

493
00:30:15,711 --> 00:30:17,161
We got you covered.

494
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:30,008
Come here, sweetie.

495
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:31,761
Come here.

496
00:30:37,412 --> 00:30:39,312
He called his grandmother...

497
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:42,063
and his mom.

498
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:48,092
I thought he was the one.

499
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,710
I know.

500
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:53,710
He can't even call
after three years?

501
00:30:54,714 --> 00:30:56,514
I don't know what to do...

502
00:30:57,569 --> 00:30:59,769
I'm so tired of feeling like this.

503
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:01,368
I know.

504
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,509
And you're gonna survive,

505
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:07,083
and good things are gonna start
to happen again.

506
00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:09,216
And one day, you may even look back,

507
00:31:09,341 --> 00:31:11,882
and even this will not be
such a bad thing.

508
00:31:27,056 --> 00:31:28,556
Who the hell's that?

509
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:33,570
- I thought you bring the whole team.
- They all had some party to go to.

510
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:35,005
Who is he?

511
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:37,241
That's Tinker. He's on my team.
He came to help out.

512
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:39,948
Thanks for coming, Tink.

513
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:42,674
Hello, Tyra.

514
00:31:43,897 --> 00:31:46,321
This is Landry Clarke calling.

515
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,640
I am here at the...

516
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:53,791
designated rest stop
that we agreed upon.

517
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:57,568
It's kind of obvious that you are...

518
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,331
not gonna show up, which is fine,
I just kind of wanted to...

519
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,463
see you face-to-face

520
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:08,459
and kind of find out what the deal is,
if I'm supposed to wait for you or not.

521
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:10,041
Because if I'm supposed to,

522
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:12,682
I will wait.
I will...

523
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,611
wait like one of those

524
00:32:15,547 --> 00:32:18,048
British foot guards
outside of Buckingham Palace.

525
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:20,586
I will keep my eyes straight ahead.

526
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:23,057
I won't look to the left
or to the right.

527
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:32,009
I kind of have a feeling
that you're probably...

528
00:32:32,902 --> 00:32:34,352
looking to the left

529
00:32:35,183 --> 00:32:36,833
or the right or both...

530
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:41,099
Which is fine...

531
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:45,283
I guess I kind of

532
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:47,525
just answered my own question.

533
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:51,197
I guess I will...

534
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:54,822
see you around, then.

535
00:33:14,106 --> 00:33:16,019
Everybody, thank you
very much for coming out.

536
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:18,342
Remember that every
raffle ticket that you buy,

537
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,544
every dollar that you stick
between the thighs

538
00:33:20,712 --> 00:33:24,381
of one of these luscious,
beautiful women goes to help me,

539
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:28,158
goes to help you, goes to help my family
and my future kid, all right?

540
00:33:28,283 --> 00:33:29,620
Thank you for coming out.

541
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:32,756
I can't open it.
You got to help me.

542
00:33:32,924 --> 00:33:34,452
Everybody rip it!

543
00:33:48,947 --> 00:33:51,097
Come here.
Let me holler at you.

544
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:55,515
- It's a nice place you got right here.
- Thank you.

545
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:57,647
Ready to make some real money?

546
00:33:58,548 --> 00:34:00,984
Yeah, I...
I need to make some money.

547
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:04,888
I got a business opportunity
that can really make you a rich man.

548
00:34:06,142 --> 00:34:08,771
What kind of business opportunity
you talking about?

549
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:11,396
I can't talk
about that right now, man.

550
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:12,963
- Okay.
- But...

551
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:14,931
Let me holler at my man.
I'll get back.

552
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,568
Congratulations on the kid, man.

553
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,430
Hey, Tim Riggins.

554
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:34,559
What are you doing here?

555
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:37,120
- Surprised to see me?
- Yes, I am surprised to see you.

556
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:39,022
- Why are you here?
- Mom's at work.

557
00:34:39,265 --> 00:34:40,515
Dad's at a bar.

558
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,093
Mom gave the dog back.

559
00:34:45,191 --> 00:34:47,818
She always has to have
everything her way.

560
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,086
Can't wait till my dad comes back.

561
00:34:53,612 --> 00:34:55,162
Come on, let's dance.

562
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,312
Becks, come here for a second.

563
00:35:02,805 --> 00:35:05,305
Come here,
listen to me for one second.

564
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:07,817
Your dad's not coming back.

565
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,887
How would you know that?

566
00:35:11,128 --> 00:35:14,190
I know he's not coming back,
because I heard him on the phone.

567
00:35:14,598 --> 00:35:16,493
He's got a kid.
He lives in Seattle.

568
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:18,695
He's got a whole family there.

569
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:22,052
That's why he bought you a dog.

570
00:35:22,177 --> 00:35:24,301
Listen to me.
This is what they do...

571
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:26,663
Your dad, my dad.

572
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:29,906
They leave, and they don't come back.
They buy you these things

573
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:34,310
so it's not uncomfortable for the five
minutes a year they're in your face.

574
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:36,846
You start to blame yourself,
the people around you,

575
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:39,070
because they've tried,
and you pushed...

576
00:35:39,195 --> 00:35:41,886
- Listen to me.
- Could you not do it here, please?

577
00:35:42,011 --> 00:35:44,721
- I want you to know it's not...
- Can we just talk about this at home?

578
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,891
Can we just talk about this at home?

579
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:58,058
Tink, where'd you learn
how to build like this?

580
00:35:58,183 --> 00:36:00,070
My granddad worked in construction.

581
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:03,563
You know what you're doing.

582
00:36:04,235 --> 00:36:05,241
Yes, sir.

583
00:36:07,337 --> 00:36:08,337
Thank you.

584
00:36:09,307 --> 00:36:11,748
No big deal.
Luke's a good guy.

585
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:15,292
He's one of those players
that's holding this team together.

586
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:18,056
He's pretty much a star.
Never acts like it, though.

587
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:19,831
I figure you know that.

588
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,959
I figure if I'm helping out Luke,
I'm helping out the team.

589
00:36:25,189 --> 00:36:26,783
You're a good man.

590
00:36:35,305 --> 00:36:36,606
I told you not to tell her!

591
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,913
- What?
- I said I was gonna tell her.

592
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:41,110
I told you not to tell her.
What the hell did you do?

593
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:44,447
- You weren't gonna say a thing.
- You think you're hot stuff, don't you?

594
00:36:44,632 --> 00:36:47,283
I find out you touched my daughter,
I'm gonna kick your...

595
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:49,819
Funny thing is, you don't give
a damn about your daughter.

596
00:36:50,057 --> 00:36:51,554
You know what else is funny?

597
00:36:51,722 --> 00:36:53,089
I had sex with your wife.

598
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:27,635
I know it's late.

599
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,359
I'm sorry.
But is Coach home?

600
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:31,038
Yeah. One sec.

601
00:37:31,597 --> 00:37:32,428
Hon?

602
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,682
What you doing here?
You all right?

603
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:40,503
Yeah. I'm getting there.

604
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:45,971
There you go.

605
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,666
All right.

606
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:52,181
- Sorry for coming by so late.
- It's all right.

607
00:38:22,504 --> 00:38:23,954
That kid trusts me.

608
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:30,161
What do we do with it?

609
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:34,283
It's gonna disappear.

610
00:38:38,758 --> 00:38:40,508
It's been a strange week.

611
00:39:09,051 --> 00:39:10,401
It's all right...

612
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:16,669
How you doing?

613
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:20,184
I'm here to get a dog about way big.

614
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:22,972
A disgruntled redhead
dropped him off yesterday.

615
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,908
And you're not gonna
bring him back tomorrow?

616
00:39:27,692 --> 00:39:30,946
Because people aren't always
very responsible about these dogs.

617
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:33,749
Are you gonna be
a responsible person?

618
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:36,429
Yes, ma'am.

619
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:40,456
After this pen,
you want to call it a day?

620
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:44,326
If we don't finish up now,
we'll just have to do it again tomorrow.

621
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:45,928
All right, then.
Round them up.

622
00:39:46,748 --> 00:39:49,098
- Nobody says that anymore.
- I just did.

623
00:39:58,282 --> 00:39:59,108
Dad!

624
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:04,392
Get out of there!
Get out!

625
00:40:05,942 --> 00:40:07,049
You all right?

626
00:40:07,217 --> 00:40:08,667
Where'd he get you?

627
00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:11,715
Son, you all right?

628
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:22,131
Hey, Jess.

629
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,672
I was looking for you,
'cause I wanted to ask you something.

630
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:31,447
Plus, I was hungry,

631
00:40:31,675 --> 00:40:34,243
so I figured you make
an unbelievable pulled-pork sandwich,

632
00:40:37,356 --> 00:40:38,547
Will you go out with me?

633
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:43,467
Things between me and Tyra
are 100% over.

634
00:40:43,803 --> 00:40:45,953
My life is no longer complicated,

635
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:48,357
and I really would like
to go out with you.

636
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:50,677
I'm really happy for you.

637
00:40:50,802 --> 00:40:52,102
Congratulations.

638
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,463
Just one date.

639
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:56,765
Why would I do that?

640
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,970
I don't...
I have a car.

641
00:41:00,203 --> 00:41:03,053
Play guitar.
I might write you a song someday.

642
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:06,275
You'd be the girl... I don't know.
Would you please go on a date with me?

643
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:07,831
So, yes?

644
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:13,248
All right, you tell me
what your name's gonna be.

645
00:41:14,294 --> 00:41:16,018
'Cause Julien it's not.

646
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:18,087
Yeah, I know.
It is boring, isn't it?

647
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:20,512
How about Skeeter?

648
00:41:20,808 --> 00:41:22,158
Oh, look at that.

649
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:24,769
Skeeter it is.

650
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,206
It's Skeeter.
Your new name

651
00:41:28,592 --> 00:41:30,733
is skeet man.
You're the skeeter.

652
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,235
You're still whining,
and I don't know why.

653
00:41:33,618 --> 00:41:35,806
Whatever you do,
don't go in here, okay?

654
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:37,212
That's lesson...

655
00:41:37,337 --> 00:41:38,707
lesson number one.

656
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:43,378
Here, don't go in here.
We're gonna pull in right now.

657
00:41:43,852 --> 00:41:47,299
Here we go.
Just please don't go in my truck.

658
00:41:49,082 --> 00:41:50,385
I'm gonna let you go.

659
00:41:54,107 --> 00:41:55,551
Okay. Do your thing.

660
00:41:55,952 --> 00:41:57,797
Do your thing, Skeeter.

661
00:42:12,677 --> 00:42:14,076
It's pretty great.
