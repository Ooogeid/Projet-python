1
00:00:00,285 --> 00:00:04,169
How about we go somewhere and talk
about anything but football?

2
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:05,591
That sounds good.

3
00:00:05,753 --> 00:00:09,595
You're some cowboy who wanders around.
I like to think there's more in you.

4
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:12,807
Sometimes, it just takes the right
woman to make it more in your heart.

5
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:15,466
So look, about 30 days time.

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,830
And get you a 20% profit
on your investment.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,618
It's flipping houses.
I saw it on TV, it works.

8
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:22,301
- I'm in.
- You're in.

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,863
Daddy bought a house today. I'm gonna
fix it up and I'm gonna sell it.

10
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:30,366
And you and me, and your mommy,
can live together.

11
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:33,744
We'll turn it over in about 30 days,
make a lot of money, and it'll get us...

12
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:36,873
I'm moving back East,
with my parents.

13
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:40,793
Freshmen, listen up!

14
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:44,380
We all seniors want to thank you
for coming out of your busy schedules

15
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:47,258
to meet us here tonight.
We've all been here.

16
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:49,510
And you guys will look back
at what you're about to do

17
00:00:49,835 --> 00:00:52,017
and understand
that there's a strong purpose to it.

18
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:53,931
Time has come for a Panther ritual.

19
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:55,799
Drummer, please.

20
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:58,113
The naked mile.

21
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:01,241
- I thought it was a myth.
- What'd you say, Charles?

22
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,475
- I said I thought it was a myth.
- I wish it was

23
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:06,110
so I don't have to see your fat ass
running naked.

24
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:08,208
You heard me, ladies.
Let's go!

25
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:10,490
Strip down, strip down!

26
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:13,780
Take your shoes off,
strip down everybody.

27
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,195
Take it all off.

28
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:18,297
- Take it all off.
- Listen up! Tell 'em Jamarcus.

29
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:20,792
Look, you all know the rules.

30
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:23,670
You're going to the water tower
and back.

31
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:25,753
No shame, no fame, baby.

32
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:28,465
McCoy, they're all running
to the water tower and back,

33
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:31,511
but you, superstar,
you're running to the field house.

34
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:34,624
I mean, wh...
Why do I have to run to the field house?

35
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:36,455
'Cause you're the quarterback, bro.

36
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:38,743
You gotta go the extra mile, dude.

37
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:40,535
Get your ass over there.

38
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:42,147
Go, get out of here.

39
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,348
Go!

40
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,065
Come on, you can do it!

41
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:32,989
Come here.

42
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,327
Where are your pants?

43
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:40,205
Tonight was the...

44
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:41,498
Naked mile.

45
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:43,708
- Yeah.
- You fell for the naked mile.

46
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:49,087
Take it to your team there and put some
clothes on, I'll give you a ride home.

47
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:51,925
Please don't tell my dad, okay?

48
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,551
Son, I wouldn't dream of it.

49
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:56,471
Okay.

50
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:06,697
You know, mum's got a light foot?

51
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:10,318
So make sure that you howl at her
if she starts going too fast.

52
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:11,947
I don't drive that fast.

53
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,570
- Yeah, you do.
- No, I don't.

54
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:17,158
Whenever I'm in the car with you, I feel
like I'm in a chase out of a Bond movie.

55
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:20,572
Your daddy doesn't have any tickets.
He never got one speeding ticket.

56
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:22,614
Unlike some people around here.

57
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:23,872
I gotta go.

58
00:03:24,558 --> 00:03:27,127
I wanna get as far as possible
while he's still kind of calm.

59
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:29,294
I love you, buddy, okay?

60
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:34,055
Wish I knew how to stay here.

61
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:37,095
That's pretty easy.
You just park the car,

62
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:39,534
and stay.

63
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,282
When you get to your parents' house,
you just tell your mom that...

64
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:47,452
he gets his good looks
and perfect manners from me.

65
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:50,775
While you're heading East,
I'll be fixing up this Garrity house.

66
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:52,485
We're gonna turn a major profit.

67
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:55,322
And have a nice cushion, so...

68
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:57,846
you and Noah and I
can get a house or...

69
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,702
just something...
Just be together.

70
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:03,745
We'll see what happens, okay?

71
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,459
Goodbye, honey.

72
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:22,173
I'm scared.

73
00:04:22,886 --> 00:04:24,657
Don't be, don't be.

74
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:27,828
- It's gonna be okay.
- Don't be scared, okay?

75
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:29,666
It's gonna be great, okay?

76
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:33,191
You know, your parents... You're
gonna have a great time with them.

77
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,386
Be safe, okay?

78
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:40,681
I love you.

79
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,828
I love you both, okay?

80
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,622
Call me.

Episode 3x06
It Ain't Easy Being J.D. McCoy

84
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:51,646
- Thank you for making coffee, honey.
- You're welcome. Coming at you.

85
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:55,348
I'm excited about the dance
on Saturday night.

86
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:57,485
You're gonna be
my hot husband date.

87
00:05:57,645 --> 00:06:00,842
The principal has the obligation
of being the chaperon at the dance.

88
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:03,981
And you as my husband have
an obligation of being my date.

89
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,995
I'm not gonna be able to do that
cause I've got other things planned.

90
00:06:07,155 --> 00:06:09,696
No, honey, come on.
Of course, you're gonna do it.

91
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:12,417
- Would you get here for a sec?
- Honey, and I need you to chaperon,

92
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,544
and be my date most importantly.

93
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:16,840
- Julie's coming.
- I'm not going.

94
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,899
Of course, you're going.
Honey, it's your dance.

95
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,916
- Not going.
- What do you mean? No, you're not.

96
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:24,944
Y'all, come on, seriously...

97
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:27,307
I would like to propose a toast.

98
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:30,323
- Oh, really?
- To QB 1...

99
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:32,937
of the Dillon Panthers.
Cheers, pal.

100
00:06:33,097 --> 00:06:34,713
Congratulations.

101
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:36,816
No cheers?

102
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,901
No, I just save the toast
for after the game.

103
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:43,171
It's Westerby.
You're gonna smoke 'em.

104
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:47,035
Here's an important question. Is there
any cheerleader who thinks you're cute?

105
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:50,328
- Oh yeah.
- Really?

106
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:54,084
There's two actually.
I have not actually proposed to them.

107
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:57,794
We can talk about that now.
You can only propose one at the time.

108
00:06:57,956 --> 00:07:01,935
J.D. isn't getting serious about
any girls right now, he's too busy.

109
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:04,719
No, honey, that was a joke.

110
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,609
Let me tell you something.

111
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:09,182
I know that you've experienced
a lot of pressure recently,

112
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:11,267
but you have worked hard,

113
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,810
and you have shown everyone
what you are made of.

114
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:16,147
And for that,
I am very very proud.

115
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:20,443
- Thanks, dad.
- You're very welcome.

116
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,613
I want to give Coach Eric Taylor
a piece of my mind.

117
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:28,076
You are QB1!
You won State!

118
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,411
I did.
I did win State.

119
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:33,331
He must've lost his natural mind.

120
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,328
To think some old boy
could step into your shoes.

121
00:07:36,448 --> 00:07:38,086
- What's his name, again?
- McCoy.

122
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:41,592
You're all on your way to school,
when you get there, all you do...

123
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,729
you just go in,
you talk to the coach, you tell him.

124
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:47,177
You've made a big mistake, all right?
It's all right, you can fix it.

125
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:49,578
You wait until I deal with it.

126
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:51,933
I gotta get going okay?
I'll get you during lunch.

127
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,811
He thinks he knows football!

128
00:07:55,673 --> 00:07:57,251
- ... to make some money.
- OK.

129
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:58,508
Timmy...

130
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:01,813
Glad you could join us, today. How did
you get outta school? What's your alibi?

131
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:03,401
I just told them I'm pregnant.

132
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:07,907
So I just need a few days to relax.

133
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:12,745
Let's get to work.
Let's start with this, here, work list.

134
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,862
I told you miss bossy pants
had a work list.

135
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:19,710
- Is there a problem with the work list?
- No you get organized, it's all good.

136
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:22,003
Why do we have to do
everything upstairs?

137
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:26,716
- We'll forget you just said that...
- Oh, yeah...

138
00:08:26,878 --> 00:08:29,971
I was thinking, maybe the first place
we could start would be the bathroom.

139
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:31,639
But we need a sledgehammer to...

140
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:34,475
To start working on it.
If you can pick it up, it'd be awesome.

141
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:39,604
- Whatever.
- I was just asking.

142
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:42,817
- What the hell is wrong with him?
- You're bossy.

143
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:45,610
- I'm not bossy.
- That was abrupt.

144
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,758
What is this song about?

145
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,418
Really, this song is about
a lot of stuff so...

146
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:14,127
- it's hard for me to explain that.
- It's really slow.

147
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:16,857
It's slow for a reason.
Not all songs can be...

148
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:19,020
as fast as most of our songs.
Listen...

149
00:09:19,294 --> 00:09:21,536
Jimmy, I hate to be
this brutally honest with you

150
00:09:21,656 --> 00:09:23,900
but you're really not all that good.

151
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,818
I don't think it's all the drummer.

152
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:29,322
I don't see anyone else with any
sort of... Where are you going?

153
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:32,200
I am gonna leave.
I don't need this.

154
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,287
- I will see you tomorrow, Jimmy.
- That's it, Landry. I quit.

155
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:38,663
That's fun.
I could care less, Caster.

156
00:09:38,993 --> 00:09:40,174
You know, this sucks.

157
00:09:40,294 --> 00:09:42,710
I really thought we were gonna
be bigger than Crimson Thorn.

158
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:46,172
Okay...
Well, Caster, for you information,

159
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:48,389
I chose the name Crucifictorious,

160
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:51,511
so therefore, I keep it, and also

161
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:55,011
I will see you tomorrow, Jimmy
cause I know you're gonna be right back.

162
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:56,849
No, you won't cause I'm out of here.

163
00:09:57,336 --> 00:09:58,803
What did you say?

164
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:01,977
I'll see you tomorrow.

165
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:06,060
So I was thinking, how about
you take off a little early tonight...

166
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,616
and come by the pool hall.

167
00:10:07,937 --> 00:10:09,362
I would love to, but I can't.

168
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,448
Really, why? You got
a date with boyfriend number two?

169
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,307
Yeah, how d'you know?

170
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:17,203
No, I've got to make decorations
for the school dance and...

171
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:20,286
I have to work overtime
for this entire month.

172
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:23,793
I don't know, college applications
are like 150 a piece so...

173
00:10:24,852 --> 00:10:26,571
I'm lucky if I get three.

174
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:29,670
How about...

175
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:32,260
I make things
a little easier on you?

176
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:33,946
What are you doing?

177
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,598
Just making sure my girl gets to go
to a college she wants to go to.

178
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:39,600
- No, I can't, I cannot do that.
- Yes, you can. Please.

179
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,183
Please...

180
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:48,734
Do you...

181
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,654
- Do you wanna go to this dance with me?
- No, I don't.

182
00:10:51,814 --> 00:10:53,193
I don't wanna go to the dance

183
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:55,992
but I'd love to pick you up
from the high school dance, though.

184
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,244
Alright.

185
00:10:58,704 --> 00:11:00,306
- OK.
- Alright, babe.

186
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:03,638
- Gimme a call when you're out.
- Talk to you later.

187
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:07,581
Big tipper?

188
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:10,296
Hey, it's for my
college applications.

189
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:11,798
Sure that's all it's for?

190
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:16,127
All that and my, you know...
high-class sucker job.

191
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:19,098
Open, open!

192
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:20,558
Set blue 8!

193
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:22,518
Blue 8!
Hut!

194
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:25,812
There he is!
There he is!

195
00:11:25,973 --> 00:11:28,524
- Set your feet, J.D!
- Come on, naked gun, you're good...

196
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,634
QB blind.

197
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:33,271
Settle down into it.

198
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:35,823
Settle down, man.
He's right there.

199
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:38,199
- You gotta be naked next time.
- Watch these steps.

200
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,627
Come on, naked gun.

201
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,541
- Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

202
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,981
Naked mile.

203
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,690
That's a Panther tradition, Coach.

204
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,262
Big game coming up. Team needs to be
focused. Team captain should know that.

205
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:04,350
J.D. is a young quarterback. He needs
to know this team is behind him.

206
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:06,728
We are, Sir.
Especially on the field.

207
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:09,217
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

208
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:10,450
He does, huh?

209
00:12:10,793 --> 00:12:12,734
You know damn well
this team respects you.

210
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:15,277
You accept this kid,

211
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:19,246
this team is gonna accept him.
I need that.

212
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:21,625
I need you to fix it.

213
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,466
I don't understand.
What do you mean, fix it?

214
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:28,057
You're a senior...

215
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:31,294
You're not gonna be wearing
the Panther uniform much longer.

216
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:33,800
I want you to think about that.

217
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,003
Think about everything it means.

218
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:38,855
I'm asking for your help.

219
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:42,832
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, Sir.

220
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,020
Good.

221
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,162
Get in!

222
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:07,414
I, huh, no...
I was just gonna get on the bus.

223
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:10,126
Get in the truck, 1-2.

224
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:23,956
You've uh...
You've had a tour of Dillon, right?

225
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:29,102
Well, not my Dillon, my friend.
Let's go.

226
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:34,816
Where exactly are we going?

227
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:37,779
It's on your right.
Look right.

228
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,908
You need to know this spot, OK?
It's called <i>The Landing Strip</i>.

229
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,915
My sister in law,
my brother's future wife...

230
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:47,705
works there and probably will
for the rest of her life.

231
00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:50,206
You are not ready for that, son.

232
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,085
And when you are, you will know.

233
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:59,509
Up here, on our right,
we have Fran's hamburgers. 24/7.

234
00:14:00,137 --> 00:14:03,971
Best hamburgers, best fans
in all of high school football.

235
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:08,142
The real rally girls.
And I hope you know what that means.

236
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,816
Good times, man. I can tell
what kind of support we get.

237
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:17,318
Alright, we got Smittie's dive bar.

238
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:21,632
They know me as Toby,
two times Iraq veteran.

239
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,688
If you ever wanna get away from
anything, anyone, you will go in there.

240
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:28,413
You hear me? Smittie's.

241
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:30,601
Best bar on the planet.

242
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:34,729
- Lisa lives down this road.
- Who?

243
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:38,089
You'll know, you'll know.
She's good times...

244
00:14:45,728 --> 00:14:47,431
This is the place, uh?

245
00:14:49,043 --> 00:14:50,518
Alright, man. It was fun.

246
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:56,761
Coach put you up to this?

247
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:00,819
- Really?
- Good night, man.

248
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,814
Look at you, my beautiful baby!

249
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,876
- I think this might be the one.
- You do, honey?

250
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:18,379
I had no idea I would get
so emotional.

251
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:21,838
You look just like an angel.

252
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,104
Tyra! Doesn't she look
just like an angel from heaven?

253
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:28,680
Mindy, I love you,
but I can see your crack.

254
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:33,038
It's just a smidge.
It's just a little bit, there.

255
00:15:33,273 --> 00:15:36,104
- It's very tasteful, it's subtle.
- Yes, it's subtle.

256
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,316
I could've used your support, today.
You could've left the paperwork at home.

257
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:43,647
- What are you doing? What is this?
- It's my application.

258
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:47,032
For the University of San Francisco?
How are you gonna hang on to that cowboy

259
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:49,034
if you're out there in California?

260
00:15:49,194 --> 00:15:50,868
I don't wanna hang on to anybody.

261
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,704
That's mistake #1.

262
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:54,873
You know,
Cash is very supportive of me.

263
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:58,623
I know. They are all so supportive.
And then try to actually do something...

264
00:15:58,743 --> 00:16:01,372
He gave me money
for my application fees.

265
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:04,051
- He did?
- Yeah.

266
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,843
Well, this is a very good man.

267
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:10,119
They don't normally like
to take care of you just like that.

268
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,639
You hang on to that man.

269
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:15,392
I'm telling you!
And I'm speaking from experience.

270
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:20,223
You know it just occurs to me, if you're
dropping a truckload on a dress,

271
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:23,235
doesn't someone
give you some champagne around here?

272
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:24,490
Anybody?

273
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:28,014
- Don't do that.
- You're not getting a burrito.

274
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:31,159
That's disgusting, dad. Do you realize
there's not even real food in it?

275
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,280
It's all like, preservatives and...

276
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:35,204
Hey, how are you doing?

277
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:37,041
Well, Coach Eric Taylor.

278
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:41,002
- How are you, ma'am? Good to see you.
- I'm not that good. You wanna know why?

279
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:43,547
I'd be doing the heck
of a lot better

280
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:45,710
if I thought you were gonna do
the right thing

281
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,799
and make my grandson
starting quarterback like he should be.

282
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,637
- Grandma, it's OK.
- No, hush!

283
00:16:50,987 --> 00:16:53,181
- Hush, he needs to hear this.
- Yes, ma'am.

284
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:55,807
This boy has played
his heart out for you.

285
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,186
I know it's difficult...

286
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:59,872
We should just let 'em talk, maybe.

287
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,196
Awkward!

288
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,980
A little bit.

289
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:09,697
Do you think we could go grab
a cup of coffee or something?

290
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:13,417
We can get lunch if you want.
She'll talk about this all day.

291
00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:17,982
So I take it she's taking
your demotion pretty hard.

292
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:19,172
Demotion?

293
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:20,917
That's a little harsh.

294
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:24,255
What do you want me to say?

295
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,633
OK, I guess demotion is appropriate.

296
00:17:28,753 --> 00:17:31,279
- How's practice been?
- It's good.

297
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:34,394
It's good.
I'm on the bench a lot now, but...

298
00:17:34,514 --> 00:17:36,934
I just get to talk to Landry more
cause he's always there.

299
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:39,837
- Alright, you think about it.
- I will.

300
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:42,507
It's hard to be mad at you,
Coach Taylor.

301
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,839
- It's good to see you.
- You'll be thinking about what I said.

302
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,210
- Yes, ma'am.
- Alright, bye-bye.

303
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:56,577
Hey guys, good news, I got the...

304
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:04,836
- Did you get the permits?
- What the hell is going on, here?

305
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:07,880
I'm just improvising, man.
Just look, look. Bigger, uh?

306
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:13,010
- Man, that is the Cadillac of toilets.
- Yeah, check it out.

307
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:14,887
- Bidet.
- Bidet?

308
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:17,618
- Right here. Bidet.
- Cleans your butt.

309
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:19,017
$1,700?

310
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:21,394
You spent $1,700 on a toilet?

311
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:25,409
- You gotta spend money to make money.
- We're on a budget, Billy!

312
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:28,985
And guess what? If we exceed that budget
we're not making any money.

313
00:18:29,286 --> 00:18:32,155
So you just wheel this back out
to the truck, cause that's going back.

314
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:35,032
That's going back now.
And who decided to bust out this wall?

315
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:36,689
Maybe it was mine.

316
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:39,454
It was a load-bearing wall.

317
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:41,998
I'd have been better off getting
my grandma and her bridge club

318
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:43,624
to finish this house.

319
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,960
Were you even looking
at the work list, anymore?

320
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:48,255
I got your work list right here.

321
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:52,341
In fact, why don't we post it on
this wall, so that nobody will miss it?

322
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:53,885
Good idea, Billy. I like that.

323
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:57,889
Don't talk to me like I'm a freaking
moron, I've worked construction before.

324
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,170
Son of a bitch...

325
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,076
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah, it hurts.

326
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,025
Shut the hell up
and get me some pliers!

327
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:11,758
No, Mindy. I can't come.

328
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:16,557
Cause I gotta do these damn decorations.
I'll probably be doing them all night.

329
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:19,508
Will you get me some dessert?

330
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:22,790
You know, like,
chocolate fudge pie thing that I love...

331
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,988
Thank you.
Bye, love you, sis.

332
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,128
<i>... first game

00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,391
<i>will start as QB 1.</i>

334
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:41,725
Hi, can I talk to Cash?

335
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:44,997
Cash doesn't live here.

336
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,064
I heard he's been
hanging around a lot.

337
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:50,067
Well, you heard wrong.

338
00:19:55,414 --> 00:19:58,200
Seriously, he's not here.
He doesn't live here.

339
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:01,536
Well, when you see him,
could you tell him that I came by?

340
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:05,373
- I don't know what this is all about...
- Really? What a surprise.

341
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:07,375
The pretty girl's out of a loop.

342
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:10,875
When you see Cash, just tell him
that he owes Ali and Tucker

343
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:14,591
$1,600 in child support, okay?

344
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:16,718
Can you do that for me?

345
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,520
<i>It's gonna do it, folks.</i>

346
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:29,857
<i>With only 25 seconds left
in this contest,</i>

347
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:31,859
<i>all the Panthers have to do</i>

348
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:35,696
<i>is take a knee, and they
can put this one in the books.</i>

349
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:38,365
Blue 8!
Hut!

350
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:41,493
<i>And that's official.
This game is over.</i>

351
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:43,901
<i>Young gun J.D. McCoy's debut</i>

352
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:46,498
<i>in the Westerby game
unbelievable, folks.</i>

353
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,900
<i>This kid has lit it up
like a Whitesnake concert.</i>

354
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,922
<i>Another check in the win column for
Coach Taylor and the Dillon Panthers.</i>

355
00:21:08,695 --> 00:21:10,306
There you go!

356
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:14,167
Big W tonight, gentlemen.
We earned it.

357
00:21:15,028 --> 00:21:18,087
Damn right, I'm gonna be there.
Guess who else's gonna be there tonight.

358
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:20,382
- Who?
- This cab right here.

359
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,452
1-2, great game, tonight.

360
00:21:23,943 --> 00:21:27,197
We're gonna go celebrate. We're gonna
create some memories, alright, 1-2?

361
00:21:28,158 --> 00:21:30,142
- No regrets.
- There you go, naked gun.

362
00:21:30,262 --> 00:21:32,960
Where is my boy? There he is.
That's what I'm talking about!

363
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:35,672
That is what I'm talking about,
young man.

364
00:21:36,115 --> 00:21:38,675
That was one hell of a ball game.
Way to go.

365
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,622
I'm so proud of you.

366
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:44,323
Riggins, what the hell?
You were bringing the heat, boy!

367
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:46,642
You were on fire!
Way to go, boy!

368
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,277
- Excellent game!
- Yeah, he played great.

369
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:52,188
Great job, guys, thank you so much.
Great game!

370
00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:54,149
We're gonna go celebrate

371
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:57,569
with your mom, over at Applebee's.
Come on, now. We're gonna celebrate.

372
00:21:57,843 --> 00:21:59,529
- Come on! Here we go.
- Okay.

373
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:00,718
Alright...

374
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,660
Alright, boys, see you later.
Great game, great game.

375
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,454
I told you, man.
Daddy got him on a leash.

376
00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:22,682
Good practice.
Hey, good video session.

377
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:27,745
You look pretty sweet, you know?

378
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:31,937
I came to see about...
just to check in with you about tonight.

379
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:35,483
Tonight?

380
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:38,527
The dance. The Dillon dance.

381
00:22:38,883 --> 00:22:40,278
You totally forgot.

382
00:22:40,717 --> 00:22:42,886
- The Dillon dance...
- Where is it?

383
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:44,657
Come on. It's in Dillon.

384
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:47,717
I just thought it'd be fun to go.

385
00:22:47,837 --> 00:22:50,246
You know, do one together
before it's all over.

386
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:53,332
Are you gonna wear something
as cute as this, tonight?

387
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,240
- Maybe...
- Then I'm going, with bells on.

388
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:00,717
We're gonna have the time of our lives
at the dance, tonight.

389
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,342
- I love dances.
- I do, too.

390
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:06,394
Alright, this looks good.

391
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,543
I'll take this whole palette.
I need it delivered to 213, Pinehurst

392
00:23:10,663 --> 00:23:11,976
by tomorrow morning or noon.

393
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:14,562
- You got it.
- OK. Thank you. I appreciate it.

394
00:23:14,723 --> 00:23:17,648
- Jason, how are you doing?
- Good, Coach. How are you doing?

395
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,526
- How are you?
- Doing well. What brings you down here?

396
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:23,625
I got a honey-do list.
I see you got one, too.

397
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:24,864
No, not quite.

398
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:28,722
The Riggins brothers and I have bought
Buddy Garrity's house, and so we're...

399
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:31,162
fixing it up, so I had to come
and pick a bunch of stuff up.

400
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:32,748
You what?

401
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:35,594
Riggins brothers and I have bought
the Garrity's house to flip it.

402
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,982
- Tim and Billy?
- Yeah, and Herc.

403
00:23:38,102 --> 00:23:40,678
We all got together,
and put the money in.

404
00:23:40,848 --> 00:23:43,219
We got a good deal on the house.
And we're flipping it.

405
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,385
- Buddy Garrity's house?
- Yeah.

406
00:23:45,678 --> 00:23:48,847
You know, we're upgrading it,
making it a lot more upscale

407
00:23:49,057 --> 00:23:52,322
and we gonna sell it. I know it sounds
crazy with the market nowadays...

408
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:55,353
We got a good team, working 24 hours
a day. We gonna make this thing happen.

409
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,469
And... I'm excited.

410
00:23:57,765 --> 00:23:59,815
Haven't had any snags
or anything, so...

411
00:24:00,026 --> 00:24:01,943
That's great.
That's great.

412
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:03,486
I gotta get going.

413
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,788
It's good to see you. You'd stop
by the house, check it out.

414
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:10,060
- I'll do that. I'm sure it is.
- It's looking real nice.

415
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:11,577
Alright, Coach.

416
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:15,290
You just put it right here.
I'll just take the whole thing.

417
00:24:15,902 --> 00:24:18,917
I am a stupid, stupid girl.

418
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:21,974
You are not a stupid girl.

419
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:24,966
He's a stupid guy for thinking he can
get away with something like that.

420
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,719
You know what the worst part is?
I liked him.

421
00:24:30,688 --> 00:24:32,681
I even think
I was falling in love with him.

422
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:36,103
Maybe there is some sort of
random explanation

423
00:24:36,524 --> 00:24:38,897
and it's not really
as bad as it seems.

424
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:41,437
Julie, a woman came to my house

425
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:44,701
telling me that my boyfriend
owes her child support.

426
00:24:45,205 --> 00:24:46,570
How much worse could that get?

427
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,406
She could be his sister.

428
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:53,859
I mean, theoretically,
that'd be a lot worse.

429
00:24:54,345 --> 00:24:56,301
Something Landry would say.

430
00:24:59,258 --> 00:25:01,545
Tyra, 3 o'clock.
Turn around.

431
00:25:02,786 --> 00:25:04,380
- How's my lady?
- Don't touch me.

432
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,642
You need to leave now.
You need to leave, right now.

433
00:25:08,762 --> 00:25:10,611
Slow down, hold on.
What's going on?

434
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:12,268
Just calm down...

435
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:14,390
What am I talking about?
How about some woman

436
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:16,852
comes to my house with a baby
that she says is yours.

437
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:18,270
My house!

438
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,140
- Tyra, look...
- No, you know what? Don't touch me.

439
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,364
I want you to leave, right now.

440
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:27,200
- You're not gonna let me explain.
- No. You know, here...

441
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:29,864
Why don't you give this to her,
for child support, OK?

442
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Go!

443
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,847
This is good!

444
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,444
You got everything
that you need for...

445
00:25:44,614 --> 00:25:47,981
- Yeah, it's good.
- It's good? It's gonna be fun, man.

446
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:50,634
Thanks for coming back and everything.
I appreciate it.

447
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:52,678
Alright, man. Let's do this!

448
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:55,348
Just follow him and me,

449
00:25:55,742 --> 00:25:57,772
just relax, and...

450
00:25:58,496 --> 00:26:00,144
Let's see what you got!
Alright, ready?

451
00:26:10,186 --> 00:26:13,073
Thank you for coming. It's just not...
It didn't feel right.

452
00:26:32,304 --> 00:26:34,346
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah, man.

453
00:26:38,845 --> 00:26:41,089
Hi, guys. My name is Devin.

454
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:44,633
I'm in freshman course
right now, and...

455
00:26:44,753 --> 00:26:47,844
I really just wanna expand more,
like, music-wise.

456
00:26:47,964 --> 00:26:50,481
So I decided I'd come
and audition today.

457
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:53,783
Well, we appreciate
you coming up, Devin.

458
00:26:54,454 --> 00:26:56,116
So, I'm just gonna
plug in real quick.

459
00:26:56,543 --> 00:26:59,578
Alright, let's just give it a shot
and see what happens...

460
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:01,633
That was...

461
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,327
- That was pretty fun.
- good.

462
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:07,609
I mean she's in, right?

463
00:28:09,006 --> 00:28:12,060
- I think so. That was good.
- I think so.

464
00:28:12,418 --> 00:28:14,452
I think you're in, congratulations.

465
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:16,865
I think we're all set on vocals,
pretty much.

466
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,741
But we'll see what happens.

467
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:22,153
I'd like to be in this band, so...
That'd be great.

468
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,039
Great!

469
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:35,926
Hey, Coach!

470
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:38,862
Come on in.

471
00:28:39,355 --> 00:28:41,805
It's work in progress,
as you can see.

472
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,191
Yeah, I can see it is.

473
00:28:44,415 --> 00:28:45,809
We progressed so far, as to

474
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,354
take a perfectly livable house
and turn it into a place

475
00:28:48,516 --> 00:28:52,107
that if a bum saw, would say, "Thanks,
I'll go back to sleep under the bridge."

476
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,878
So, we're, you know...
getting there.

477
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:57,614
My dad used to say,

478
00:28:57,734 --> 00:29:00,033
"It always looks bad
before it gets better."

479
00:29:01,225 --> 00:29:03,774
I don't think
it's gonna get better, Coach.

480
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:06,289
I think I've made
the biggest mistake in my life.

481
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:09,834
The mother of my child and my son are
in a car on their way up to New Jersey.

482
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:13,462
I decided that the smartest thing to do
would be to buy a house and flip it

483
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:15,214
with the Riggins brothers and Herc.

484
00:29:15,806 --> 00:29:17,966
Cause I didn't know what else to do.
I love them so much,

485
00:29:18,128 --> 00:29:19,898
I just don't wanna be
a debt beat dad,

486
00:29:20,018 --> 00:29:23,526
I just wanna be able to provide a
little bit, some security, something...

487
00:29:24,064 --> 00:29:25,625
anything for them and...

488
00:29:26,262 --> 00:29:29,222
Slow down. Slow down a second.
Wait a second.

489
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:33,857
First of all, you're not gonna be a debt
beat dad. You need to calm down, here.

490
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,173
Look, you're 20 years old.

491
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:39,641
You're not supposed to know what you'll
do with the rest of your life, yet.

492
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:42,599
You're doing what you think is best.
You're following through it.

493
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:44,326
That's what you should be doing.

494
00:29:44,488 --> 00:29:47,288
You had a plan, you're executing it.
What's wrong with that?

495
00:29:47,408 --> 00:29:49,411
But you gotta give it a chance,
give yourself time.

496
00:29:49,531 --> 00:29:52,251
You can't beat yourself up
cause you're taking chances on things.

497
00:29:52,412 --> 00:29:55,305
But don't start giving up on what
you set forward to do in the beginning

498
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:57,715
cause that's gonna get you nowhere.
I promise you that.

499
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:14,857
I borrowed Landry's car.

500
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:18,812
And you drove it over here...

501
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:24,256
Do you wanna go to the lake?

502
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,913
Have you ever been
fired from anything?

503
00:30:43,245 --> 00:30:47,012
One time, when I was 12 years old,
I babysat for the Griffins

504
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:49,687
and I never got asked back.

505
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:56,868
- You still carry that with you, huh?
- I still carry that until this day.

506
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,445
That's rough.
I don't know, I mean...

507
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:03,072
I never thought I was gonna play
professional football...

508
00:31:03,981 --> 00:31:07,451
but I kinda thought it might help pay
for college or something, and now...

509
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:10,037
I'm a senior
and I'm sitting on the bench.

510
00:31:10,984 --> 00:31:13,268
Bottom line, it just...
sucks.

511
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,202
Yeah, it does.

512
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,346
But you know what's kinda cool?
It's the first Saturday I can remember

513
00:31:19,466 --> 00:31:23,050
waking up and not having to think about
everything I did wrong the night before.

514
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:27,020
- Well, see, that's a good thing.
- Yeah, that's a good thing.

515
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:31,643
- So, do you feel prepared?
- Prepared for what?

516
00:31:31,962 --> 00:31:34,979
Prepared to get
your but whipped by a girl.

517
00:31:37,212 --> 00:31:38,674
That was rude.

518
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:41,986
I'm gonna get you!

519
00:31:49,004 --> 00:31:50,072
Good job.

520
00:31:52,512 --> 00:31:53,512
Hey, honey!

521
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,961
What is it about rice crispy treats
that they're just so darn good?

522
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:03,898
Let me tell you something.

523
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:06,390
You've been doing a great job.

524
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,885
- It's quite an achievement.
- Honey...

525
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,351
I'm serious.

526
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:12,612
I'm proud of you.

527
00:32:13,373 --> 00:32:14,643
Thank you.

528
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:17,729
Of course I'm thinking
my husband is in the process

529
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:20,850
of blowing me off which is not
making me very happy.

530
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,484
These men! It's typical, right?

531
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,114
Well, I don't know. In his case,
he usually has something else come up

532
00:32:26,274 --> 00:32:29,367
- but I thought he'd be here tonight.
- I broke up with Cash.

533
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:34,373
- Sorry, honey.
- No you're not.

534
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:36,149
Yeah, I am.

535
00:32:37,113 --> 00:32:39,627
What I didn't want to happen
was for you to get hurt.

536
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:43,162
Well...

537
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:45,516
I always have this, right?

538
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,755
I'm just gonna go home.

539
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:51,158
Alright, now just keep in mind
as you're reading these

540
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:53,904
that these are all
works in progress.

541
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:57,102
Very rough...
Some of them aren't even complete.

542
00:32:58,731 --> 00:33:01,549
I know what a work
in progress means, so...

543
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,984
I'll just read it.

544
00:33:04,268 --> 00:33:07,779
- Do you dance, or anything?
- I took ballet when I was little.

545
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,838
Me too! That's...

546
00:33:13,256 --> 00:33:16,164
- I was joking.
- I thought you were joking.

547
00:33:17,816 --> 00:33:21,085
Can I say something about these songs,
just one musician to another?

548
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,837
Of course.

549
00:33:22,998 --> 00:33:26,765
Well, they all kinda feel like
they're one song about one girl.

550
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:29,878
I mean, if you think about it,
that's basically the majority

551
00:33:29,998 --> 00:33:32,721
of all rock music is about: a girl.

552
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,099
But I just...
I think our band could be really great.

553
00:33:37,301 --> 00:33:39,019
- So do I.
- I just kinda think

554
00:33:39,181 --> 00:33:42,105
that you need
to get over this girl, then.

555
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:46,069
Is she here?

556
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:52,737
Nope, she's not.

557
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:06,380
Footloose, here we come.

558
00:34:06,947 --> 00:34:08,754
I love this kind of style.

559
00:34:08,874 --> 00:34:10,716
- Yeah?
- It just feels right, you know?

560
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:11,969
Stop it.

561
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:15,722
There he is.
You look good, tonight.

562
00:34:16,231 --> 00:34:18,199
- What are you doing here?
- My mom...

563
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:20,310
- thought it'd be good to have some fun.
- Did she?

564
00:34:21,073 --> 00:34:22,397
And, are you having fun?

565
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:24,189
Not really.

566
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:26,191
- You know Lyla.
- Hi, J.D.

567
00:34:26,403 --> 00:34:27,819
How is it going?

568
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:29,822
You gonna cut a rug, or what?

569
00:34:34,415 --> 00:34:37,495
- Tell me you don't wanna go get a beer.
- I don't wanna go and get a beer.

570
00:34:37,656 --> 00:34:39,497
No, I'm serious.
Let's go somewhere fun.

571
00:34:39,658 --> 00:34:41,319
- It is fun.
- No, it's not fun.

572
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:44,210
You know what type of people have fun
at these dances? The type of people that

573
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:48,045
when they grow up, they'll look back
and have regrets. We don't want to.

574
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:49,508
Right, right?

575
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:52,092
- So you're gonna come for a beer.
- I don't drink.

576
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,475
- What do you mean?
- There you go, he doesn't drink.

577
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:57,701
My dad gave me an article,
it disrupts protein and senses...

578
00:34:57,821 --> 00:34:59,434
- What does?
- Alcohol.

579
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:02,139
Fine, who doesn't need a driver?
We're gonna get wasted.

580
00:35:02,259 --> 00:35:04,104
I can't drive.
I don't have a license.

581
00:35:04,224 --> 00:35:06,274
I can't drive.
I only have a learner's permit.

582
00:35:06,434 --> 00:35:08,692
- He doesn't have a license.
- You're coming anyways.

583
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:11,498
Let's go. Hey, just believe me,
trust me on this one.

584
00:35:11,618 --> 00:35:14,823
Just this one time, we're going.
I got... We're gonna have some memories.

585
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,950
- All right? Come on.
- Pants-off.

586
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,129
Alright, no regrets, let's do this.

587
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,087
Safety first.

588
00:35:32,194 --> 00:35:34,342
Let me know when you and your date
need a ride home.

589
00:35:35,057 --> 00:35:36,404
Is she mad at me?

590
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:37,804
Yes, McCoy.

591
00:35:38,164 --> 00:35:39,934
- Let's just have some fun.
- Okay.

592
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,387
Memories, tonight.

593
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:45,191
Nice tie!

594
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:49,160
Tyra, it's me. Open up.

595
00:35:51,646 --> 00:35:53,279
Tyra, I know you're home.
Open up.

596
00:35:53,689 --> 00:35:54,822
Go to hell, Cash!

597
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,210
Tyra, please,
just let me talk to you.

598
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,928
How about you go talk to your girlfriend
or your wife or whoever?

599
00:36:02,048 --> 00:36:03,706
She's not my girlfriend or my wife!

600
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:05,875
If you let me explain,
you'd know that.

601
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,376
Please.

602
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:09,294
Tyra, come on.

603
00:36:16,137 --> 00:36:18,012
What part of "Go to hell"
don't you understand?

604
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:20,622
- Just hear me out, please.
- Why?

605
00:36:20,742 --> 00:36:23,360
Because I think
I deserve at least that much.

606
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,936
As far as I'm concerned,
you don't deserve anything right now.

607
00:36:26,522 --> 00:36:28,874
Well, I'm sure
you don't think I do.

608
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:33,820
The girl that came here, her name
is Ally Darcy. And that's not my baby.

609
00:36:34,545 --> 00:36:35,940
I did hook up with her.

610
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,241
One time, five years ago.

611
00:36:38,649 --> 00:36:41,013
And it's not gonna
happen again, because...

612
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,453
you met her, she's crazy!

613
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:45,344
I shouldn't say that,
but she is crazy.

614
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:48,595
After we hooked up, she started
showing up at my work, making a scene,

615
00:36:48,715 --> 00:36:50,154
so, I just left town.

616
00:36:50,632 --> 00:36:54,262
I was in Wyoming doing
the rodeo circuit, and now, I'm back.

617
00:36:54,382 --> 00:36:57,033
And who comes knocking on my door
a couple months ago?

618
00:36:57,153 --> 00:36:59,177
Ally Darcy, with a two-year old.

619
00:36:59,757 --> 00:37:02,932
I hooked up with her five years ago.
There's no way that kid is mine.

620
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:05,892
And if it was, I wouldn't be
lying to you, telling you it wasn't,

621
00:37:06,402 --> 00:37:07,918
cause I'd step up.

622
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:12,733
I'm telling you the truth. I have
no reason to be dishonest with you.

623
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:18,305
That's it?

624
00:37:18,425 --> 00:37:20,449
Yes, that's it.
That's all of it.

625
00:37:21,226 --> 00:37:23,042
She made me feel so awful.

626
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,225
I'm sure she did,
I'm sorry about that.

627
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:31,627
- You're not lying to me?
- No, I'm not lying to you.

628
00:37:32,808 --> 00:37:34,493
I would never lie to you.

629
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,699
I'm sorry.
Do you forgive me?

630
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:48,853
Maybe.

631
00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:02,240
- How many girlfriends do you have?
- Just the one, McCoy.

632
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:05,619
God, she's so pretty!

633
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:07,830
Yes, she's pretty special, man.

634
00:38:08,426 --> 00:38:10,753
Alright, you're on your own
for a bit.

635
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:11,958
No, wait!

636
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:13,836
What am I supposed to do?

637
00:38:15,223 --> 00:38:18,048
If you get in trouble,
Act like you're looking for someone.

638
00:38:18,438 --> 00:38:19,528
Secondly,

639
00:38:19,986 --> 00:38:20,986
relax!

640
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:22,802
Have some fun, laugh!

641
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:26,473
There's a lot of pretty girls.
Have some fun, alright?

642
00:38:28,491 --> 00:38:30,436
I'm gonna steal her for a minute,
if that's cool?

643
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:32,996
She doesn't have the choice, sorry.

644
00:38:37,703 --> 00:38:39,362
There he is, naked gun!

645
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:42,907
Ladies and gentlemen,
J.D. McCoy cutest buns in Dillon.

646
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:45,286
Are you getting ready
to run another midnight run?

647
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,161
No, no, I did my work-out
early this morning.

648
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:50,387
J.D., man,
help yourself, bro.

649
00:38:50,943 --> 00:38:52,357
- Y'all didn't know?
- What?

650
00:38:52,495 --> 00:38:53,918
This guy's body is a temple.

651
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:57,170
He doesn't drink sodas,
doesn't eat candy,

652
00:38:57,332 --> 00:38:59,089
definitely can't drink beer.

653
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,258
Your dad runs
a tight little ship, doesn't he?

654
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:03,927
Have a drink, man!
This is a party.

655
00:39:05,753 --> 00:39:09,183
- A beer sounds pretty good right now.
- Move around, baby.

656
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:12,540
To J.D. McCoy!

657
00:39:40,122 --> 00:39:41,460
Well, look at that!

658
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:44,002
Come on, let's go.

659
00:39:50,031 --> 00:39:53,457
You're like the prettiest girl
I've ever seen in my life.

660
00:39:53,822 --> 00:39:56,500
You and Riggins are gonna make
some cute babies.

661
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,108
You're like the coolest, man.

662
00:39:58,426 --> 00:40:00,718
You're like the last American dude.

663
00:40:01,371 --> 00:40:03,560
He doesn't listen to my dad,

664
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,645
he doesn't listen to your dad,
you don't listen anybody's dad.

665
00:40:06,765 --> 00:40:08,666
That's pretty... quite odd, man!

666
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,461
I thought you were Mr. Stackhouse.

667
00:40:19,581 --> 00:40:21,171
What are you doing here?

668
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:23,955
Do you know how late it is?
Where have you been?

669
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:25,696
I've been getting dressed,
shaving...

670
00:40:25,816 --> 00:40:29,137
Don't just come in here
and try to slow down smalls with me.

671
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:32,230
- Why do have paint in your hair?
- I don't have... Don't worry why.

672
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,905
No, I do worry.
You know, you stood me up.

673
00:40:35,025 --> 00:40:37,198
- I could fire you.
- No, you can't fire me.

674
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:40,856
You can't fire me, you'd have to go
through the board supervisor, boosters,

675
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:43,040
This, that, and everything else...

676
00:40:43,383 --> 00:40:46,363
- It'd be a lot of trouble, wouldn't it?
- How was your day?

677
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,424
How was my day? I've been sitting here
at this dance with no date.

678
00:40:51,035 --> 00:40:52,080
He's here.

679
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:59,634
Veggie hot dogs are amazing!

680
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:02,753
No.
I'm just gonna stick to...

681
00:41:02,923 --> 00:41:05,174
You know,
good old fashioned, all American...

682
00:41:06,556 --> 00:41:07,568
hot dog!

683
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,583
Do you realize what you're eating?
It's like...

684
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:13,584
cow eyes,
and like a pig intestines.

685
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:16,566
And you know what?
That tastes good.

686
00:41:17,812 --> 00:41:19,016
Real good.

687
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,141
I think food is better outside.

688
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:24,318
I would have to agree with that.

689
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:28,317
But I'm really stuffed,
then we should probably get going.

690
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:30,533
Well...

691
00:41:31,002 --> 00:41:32,450
we probably should.

692
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:21,685
That is the cutest baby
I've ever seen.

693
00:43:24,379 --> 00:43:26,557
- She's adorable.
- She is such a stylish...

694
00:43:26,677 --> 00:43:29,420
Excuse us for a second,
we'll be right back.

695
00:43:30,635 --> 00:43:32,058
Coach?
Hey, how you doin'?

696
00:43:32,178 --> 00:43:34,201
- Hey, how are you?
- Good, good.

697
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:39,203
Listen, J.D. has got something
he needs to share with you.

698
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:42,733
I got... really drunk, last night.

699
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:46,001
I had a lot of alcohol,
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

700
00:43:46,162 --> 00:43:47,670
A lot of alcohol?

701
00:43:48,317 --> 00:43:50,214
He came home... drunk.

702
00:43:50,424 --> 00:43:52,173
Not so much of one sip of wine

703
00:43:52,335 --> 00:43:55,718
his entire life. 3 weeks before
the playoffs, he comes home...

704
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,764
drunk. Now, he knows
that he has disappointed his father,

705
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:02,993
he has let down his coach, his team,
and I felt that it was imperative

706
00:44:03,113 --> 00:44:05,312
that he'd come to you
and apologize personally.

707
00:44:06,298 --> 00:44:08,648
- I hope you understand.
- Understood.

708
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:10,984
Anything else he's done
that I should be aware of?

709
00:44:16,115 --> 00:44:17,553
No, he works hard.

710
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:20,661
Good, we got to keep our star
in a straighten arrow.

711
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:22,472
- Thank you so much.
- Excuse me, all.

712
00:44:22,592 --> 00:44:24,447
- Don't mean to interrupt.
- Not at all.

713
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:27,918
Seemed a little more serious for church
but she had to see her daddy.

714
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,747
She said,
"I need my daddy immediately."

715
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:33,965
Thank you, Coach. We'll talk soon.
Nice to see you.

716
00:44:34,127 --> 00:44:36,634
- Okay y'all, happy Sunday.
- All right, bye.

717
00:44:37,312 --> 00:44:39,471
- Take care, now.
- Okay, bye bye.

718
00:44:40,975 --> 00:44:43,808
- I told you to say that.
- We gotta go get that stove later.

719
00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:48,378
So, I guess when you finish with that,
we'll go ahead and...

720
00:44:48,891 --> 00:44:50,467
- Soon.
- Who's that?

721
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,860
Hey, Erin.
Did you guys make it there yet?

722
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:56,021
No, we still got another day to go.

723
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,073
I just pulled over
to give him a little break.

724
00:44:58,717 --> 00:45:01,702
I don't even know where we are
right now. Some park, somewhere.

725
00:45:03,066 --> 00:45:04,496
I miss you guys, like crazy.

726
00:45:05,277 --> 00:45:09,272
Well, we love you too,
we miss you too.

727
00:45:10,412 --> 00:45:11,753
Put the little man on.

728
00:45:12,234 --> 00:45:14,882
- Am I really that boring to talk to?
- <i>No.</i>

729
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:17,717
I just don't want my son
to forget my voice.

730
00:45:18,545 --> 00:45:20,650
He won't... forget your voice.

731
00:45:21,195 --> 00:45:22,277
Here he is.

732
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,457
- Come on. It's your daddy.
- <i>Hey Noah, hey my man.</i>

733
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:28,603
<i>It's your daddy.
Hey, I miss you.</i>

734
00:45:29,296 --> 00:45:31,774
Well, I love you.
I love you very much.

735
00:45:31,984 --> 00:45:33,859
<i>And I wish I'd be there
with you, but...</i>

736
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:36,611
I thought maybe
we could sing together, though,

737
00:45:37,046 --> 00:45:38,396
<i>in my duet</i>

738
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:41,575
<i>So, I'm gonna start singing,
you just join whenever you want, okay?</i>

739
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:45,953
<i>There's a hole in my bucket,
dear Liza,</i>

740
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:47,872
dear Liza.

741
00:45:48,398 --> 00:45:51,000
<i>There's a hole in my bucket,</i>

742
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,128
<i>dear Liza, there's a hole.</i>

743
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:55,714
<i>Now, it's your turn.</i>

744
00:45:56,484 --> 00:45:59,756
You don't wanna do the girl part today?
Okay, I'll do it.

745
00:46:00,486 --> 00:46:03,000
<i>Then fix it, dear Henry,</i>

746
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,306
<i>dear henry, dear Henry.</i>

747
00:46:05,786 --> 00:46:08,768
<i>Then fix it, dear Henry,</i>

748
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,638
dear Henry, fix it.

749
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,691
I love you, buddy.
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

750
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,650
- Tami, what did you do?
- Why?

751
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:07,990
Because if I don't have my fullback
on Friday night, I'm screwed.

752
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,169
Therefore, I'm telling you,
I should've been part of that process.

753
00:47:13,658 --> 00:47:16,703
Every time a decision is to be made,
you wave that baby around like a gun.

754
00:47:16,873 --> 00:47:20,958
Erin is up in New England with my kid.
Her parents are putting him in daycare

755
00:47:21,218 --> 00:47:23,676
which I can't afford.
How am I supposed to compete with that?

756
00:47:23,846 --> 00:47:25,106
You're leaving?
