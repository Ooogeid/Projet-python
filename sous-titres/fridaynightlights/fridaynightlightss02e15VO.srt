1
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:05,750
Be honest with yourself
for two seconds

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,410
and tell me that you don't feel
the way I feel about you.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,256
I don't feel the way you feel
about me. Move on.

4
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:13,466
- Your friend left.
- Are you trying to say

5
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:16,093
he just started wheeling
on down the road?

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,514
- You really saved my ass tonight.
- No problem.

7
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:23,735
You leave my sister alone.

<i>Smash Williams is

00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:28,189
<i>who attacked us
because we're white.</i>

10
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:30,692
They've decided
to suspend you for three games.

11
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:32,652
They're revoking my scholarship.

12
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:34,279
That's the mark of death.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,363
The best thing
you can do for me is win.

14
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,950
And no matter what happens,
y'all remember this:

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,577
y'all are State Champs.

16
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:02,732
Thank you.

17
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:05,171
Hey, give me some money.

18
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,019
- What?
- Give me some now.

19
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:09,978
- Hey, Lyla.
- Hi, Billy.

20
00:01:12,793 --> 00:01:13,693
Thanks.

24
00:01:57,747 --> 00:02:00,170
Just following up to see
if you got my other messages.

25
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,763
Like I said,
my position with TMU is changing,

26
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,505
and I'm feeling like
rolling with the tide.

27
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:06,967
Call me, okay?

28
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:21,302
For this car, everything you're getting,
is the invoice price,

29
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:22,625
direct to dealer.

30
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:25,432
And I swear to you, sir.
This is the absolute best I can do.

31
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:28,018
No, I appreciate.
It sounds like a good deal.

32
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:31,855
I'm just trying to knock
something off here. There's got to be...

33
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:34,758
All right, you know what?
You think about it,

34
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:36,943
and I'll be back
in a couple minutes, okay?

35
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:43,733
- Hello, miss.
- Hello, sir.

36
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:46,038
This is the 2008 fully loaded,
you know?

37
00:02:46,198 --> 00:02:49,456
If you're actually looking I could
probably get you a pretty good deal.

38
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:52,067
I'm not shopping for a car,
but thank you.

39
00:02:52,227 --> 00:02:54,294
I know.
I was just playing around.

40
00:02:54,747 --> 00:02:56,754
Sorry I haven't called you back.

41
00:02:57,015 --> 00:03:00,974
That's been a bit much.
It's ten calls, ten messages.

42
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,802
No call back.
What's up with that?

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,138
I didn't know what to do.
I mean...

44
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:06,841
I probably called too much.

45
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:10,165
I don't really know what the rules
are either in this exact situation.

46
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:13,314
I guess it's a one-night thing,
and I probably called too many times...

47
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:15,324
- Jason...
- How you been?

48
00:03:15,558 --> 00:03:16,741
I'm pregnant.

49
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:23,918
That's impossible.

54
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:13,896
- I want the parking lot.
- You got it.

55
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:17,501
I'm gonna trust you on that. You oughta
get it done for what we're paying.

56
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:18,705
No way!

57
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:20,380
Is that Mo?

58
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,923
Holy cow!
Who's that?

59
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:23,770
What are you doing here?

60
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,510
You look absolutely gorgeous.

61
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:28,179
- Hi, honey.
- Oh, baby, you look so...

62
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:30,706
- Who's this?
- This is Gracie belle.

63
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:32,350
- Who's baby?
- That's my baby.

64
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,069
How are you, honey?
What in the world are you doing here?

65
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:38,356
- Dallas and... all real estate.
- Really?

66
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:40,692
You're gonna...
Were you buying the <i>Bell's</i>?

67
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:42,110
Yeah, think so.

68
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:43,766
Yeah, I think maybe.

69
00:04:43,926 --> 00:04:46,400
We're looking at shopping
centers all over the state.

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,199
- Is that right?
- This is Reeves. Come here.

71
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:52,446
This was the reigning
rankin high school

72
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:55,066
- homecoming queen, 198...
- All right, enough of that.

73
00:04:55,226 --> 00:04:56,995
We don't need to tell him
what year it was.

74
00:04:57,155 --> 00:04:59,627
This is Reeves, and he's a good man.
I give him a hard time.

75
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:02,911
- We were high school sweethearts.
- Go get the car.

76
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,215
Your husband won
a State championship.

77
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:06,593
Yes, we did.

78
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:09,512
- Are you working?
- Working at the school.

79
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:11,000
You teachin'?

80
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,183
I'm counseling the kids.
Which has been great.

81
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,226
The boys must love you.

82
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,562
Mo, you are too funny.

83
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:20,899
- What are you doing tomorrow night?
- I'm home with the family.

84
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:23,109
We're doing a charity thing
at the hospital.

85
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:25,941
- Would you guys come?
- Yeah, it's at the hospital?

86
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:27,780
- Yeah.
- I'll check with him.

87
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,430
It would be an honor to have
a Texas high school coach...

88
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,374
Champion coach at our event.

89
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:34,897
Tell him I want him to come.
Invite him for me.

90
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:44,422
Why aren't you out there? Your
suspension doesn't cover this thing.

91
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:45,990
- It does today.
- Do it?

92
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,926
Yeah. Besides,
I hated this game since the fifth grade.

93
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,565
- How you doing, Brian?
- Doin'okay, coach.

94
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:15,470
- Hangin'in.
- Good.

95
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,785
It's all good.

96
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:19,658
I've been talking to some people.

97
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:21,953
Alabama, Georgia, Miami.

98
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:23,711
Good.

99
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:27,298
Matt, you're out!
Get out of there!

100
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:28,546
Good.

101
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:34,741
What a bitch!

102
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:38,946
It's not like that.

103
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:42,032
It's not like that?

104
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,916
Let me guess. She come and get
some cash for the abortion.

105
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:46,566
- That's what she want.
- No,

106
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:48,694
she doesn't want money
for the abortion.

107
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:51,285
I knew I shouldn't have said
anything to you, man.

108
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:54,322
I can never talk to you serious
about anything 'cause you're an idiot.

109
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:56,654
Am I?
Am I? I'm an idiot?

110
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:58,413
- Yeah.
- Okay, put it this way.

111
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:01,785
You go out and finally get yourself
a slice of y-bone steak,

112
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:04,256
and lo and behold,
she shows up pregnant.

113
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,904
And when she comes to tell you,
you're not even pissed off.

114
00:07:07,064 --> 00:07:08,673
- Why would I...
- "Why, why... "

115
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:12,112
You can't even take one step back
to ask yourself one serious question.

116
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:13,636
Well what's that, Herc?

117
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:16,601
- This kid even yours?
- Of course I asked her!

118
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:18,683
I'm the only one
she's been with in 2 months.

119
00:07:18,943 --> 00:07:22,186
- The only one she's been with?
- Yeah, the only guy she's been with.

120
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:25,481
Well how about a rubber, dude?
You ever think about wearing a rubber?

121
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:28,113
- Wrap that puppy, man.
- I didn't exactly think about it,

122
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:30,528
'cause everybody told me
that this wasn't possible.

123
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:32,363
So no, I didn't "wrap that puppy."

124
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,783
And if it happened, and it's true,
and it's mine, then it's a miracle.

125
00:07:39,204 --> 00:07:40,204
All right?

126
00:07:43,123 --> 00:07:43,931
Fine.

127
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:49,087
What are you gonna do
about this little miracle, Street?

128
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:53,032
Nothing I can do.
She said it's her problem.

129
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:54,791
She'll take care of it.

130
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,487
She just wanted me to know.

131
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:06,052
We got South Pines tonight,
7:30, Herrmann field home game.

132
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:08,720
<i>Uh, yeah,
we should win by 40 or more.</i>

133
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,027
- What's he doing in our studio?
- He's auditioning.

134
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:15,740
- For what?
- He wanna do a talk show about sports.

135
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,284
It's not a bad idea.
I wish I would've thought of it.

136
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:25,958
- Guess who I ran into today.
- Who?

137
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,504
Walking right out of <i>Bell's</i>,
I was on my way to daycare,

138
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:31,308
bumped right on into him.

139
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:32,256
Who?

140
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:36,719
- Mo McArnold.
- Who's Mo McArnold?

141
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:38,589
Why's Mo McArnold in town?

142
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,733
He's here buying up real estate.

143
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:42,750
"Real estate",
like a house or what?

144
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,279
No, he's buying
a whole shopping center.

145
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:47,438
Apparently
he's a big mogul now or something.

146
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:48,940
Who is Mo McArnold?

147
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:52,192
Mo McArnold's an old boyfriend
of your mom's till I came along.

148
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:55,148
Lucky for both of you,
the best man won.

149
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:57,532
That's right, honey.
I'm your prize guernsey.

150
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,283
That's right, baby.

151
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:04,138
Wouldn't it be fun to see him?
'cause he invited us to go to this...

152
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:08,209
hospital charity benefit tomorrow night.
Which I think could be kinda neat.

153
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:11,169
He's all involved with it.
It's right over at the hospital.

154
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,436
- Don't you think that'd be a neat idea?
- That'd be really nifty.

155
00:09:15,251 --> 00:09:17,552
Well I sorta thought
it would be nice.

156
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,846
It's nice that he's in town
and everything.

157
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:21,222
He'd like to see you.

158
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:23,793
You could go without...
Don't think he wants to see me.

159
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:26,814
- It's all water under the bridge.
- Water under the bridge...

160
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:28,852
- It's been so long.
- He talks a lot.

161
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:30,882
- He's always talking.
- I know! He does!

162
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:34,213
He's got that crazy energy,
but it'd be fun.

163
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,550
C'mon, hon.

164
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:41,199
- Sure this is a good idea?
- Yes, it is.

165
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:43,472
You've to put a face
in front of the customer.

166
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:46,019
It's, like, the basic
fundamental of selling.

167
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:48,736
This is crazy.
I'm used to them selling to me.

168
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:50,750
Okay, listen to me.

169
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:53,337
You are Smash Williams,

170
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:57,008
star running back of
the State champion Dillon Panthers.

171
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,827
You set conference records
in yards, rushing,

172
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:02,054
and touchdowns scored
two years in a row.

173
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,404
Remember who you are.

174
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:06,826
Remember who you're gonna be.

175
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:10,605
If they got a second chance to sign you,
then they're gonna be totally psyched.

176
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,107
So go out there and do your thing.

177
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:17,028
Because when you get back,
you're totally gonna get laid.

178
00:10:18,262 --> 00:10:19,155
For real?

179
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:20,948
No, I'm pms-ing.

180
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:24,202
But go! Come on,
get out of this car! Go!

181
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:27,215
You're Smash williams,
don't forget that.

182
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,589
Hey, Mr. Powers.

183
00:10:38,362 --> 00:10:40,717
- How you doing?
- Doing good. Good.

184
00:10:41,163 --> 00:10:42,345
I made a mistake.

185
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:46,098
I got caught up in the moment, it was
a rash decision, but I changed my mind.

186
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,100
I know TMU pulled
your scholarship, son.

187
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:51,937
- Nice try though.
- Look, I run a 4.4 flat.

188
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,649
I set conference records in yards
and touchdowns, two years in a row.

189
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,317
Nobody's better in the state.

190
00:10:57,654 --> 00:10:59,598
Look, Mr. Powers,
I'm standing right here,

191
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:02,698
and I'm telling you that Smash is ready
to come to Tuscaloosa.

192
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,741
Problem is the spot's taken.

193
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:07,285
You may be the best running back,

194
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,846
but we got a verbal commitment
from Juette Coleman

195
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:11,828
outta Christian Oaks in California.

196
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:14,709
He oughta fit in real nicely
with this QB right here.

197
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:19,742
Mr. Powers...

198
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,553
Please.
What, you want me to beg?

199
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:25,741
Look, I'm sorry
for your situation, Brian,

200
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:28,015
but you turned us down, remember?

201
00:11:28,276 --> 00:11:31,018
- But like I said, it was a mistake.
- We honor our commitments.

202
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,438
Juette Coleman is coming to Alabama,
and you're not gonna change that.

203
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:38,368
To be quite honest,
we're the university of Alabama.

204
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:40,527
We don't play
second fiddle to anybody.

205
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:43,947
Good luck to you, Brian.

206
00:11:46,987 --> 00:11:48,786
Tell your mom I said hi.

207
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,473
Hey you, number three.

208
00:12:27,469 --> 00:12:28,624
How you doing?

209
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,663
- I'm all right. How are you?
- Pretty good.

210
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:35,312
So, uh, you hear about
the premiere coming up?

211
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:36,565
Premiere?

212
00:12:37,127 --> 00:12:38,127
Yeah, premiere.

213
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:40,338
Sports, Riggs,

214
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:42,130
radio.

215
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:44,090
Congratulations.

216
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,718
Thank you.

217
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,302
You're welcome.

218
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:48,721
How's the boy doing?

219
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:50,431
- Good.
- Really?

220
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:54,559
So good that he invited me to the ranch
this weekend and meet his family.

221
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:57,313
Family ranch.
That's great.

222
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,024
It's gonna be great,
you're not gonna be able to find us.

223
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,197
- How was school today?
- It was fine.

224
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:10,326
- Mr. And Mrs. Clarke.
- Sweetheart, do not wash that bowl,

225
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:12,620
I have every intention
of licking it.

226
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:18,376
Did you... did you, um,
did you hear?

227
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:21,336
- Hear what?
- About me and Tyra?

228
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:25,674
Oh, yes. I saw the two of you
holding hands. That was really cute.

229
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:28,593
What happened to Jean?
I thought the two of you were, like...

230
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:32,058
It's kind of a really long story.
It's kind of complicated.

231
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:35,340
It's not as easy
as Tyra came into the situation.

232
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:38,354
Okay, well...
Gimme something.

233
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:43,608
I don't know,
but I'll tell you one thing.

234
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:46,612
In, like, you know, the boudoir...

235
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,283
Tyra does things
that I didn't even know...

236
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:54,662
She probably knows what she's doing.
She's had some practice.

237
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,367
It's not like you're her first...

238
00:13:58,082 --> 00:13:59,082
Or second.

239
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:00,750
She was with Riggins.

240
00:14:01,012 --> 00:14:03,294
Now why would you bring
something like that up?

241
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:05,811
- I know that she...
- I just didn't really realize

242
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,675
that she was your type.

243
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:10,257
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I didn't realize

244
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,512
that a hot mexican nanny
was your type.

245
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:14,806
Look, she's not a mexican,
and she's not a nanny.

246
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:16,966
She's a guatemalan
in-home care nurse.

247
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:19,185
I told you that, like,
a hundred times, okay?

248
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:22,690
And she blew me off, just like Tyra's
gonna blow you off and take off

249
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,985
back to whatever other cooler guy
comes along when you're... You know.

250
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,923
But you don't have to worry about that
because we're gonna be okay.

251
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:03,730
So I've been thinking...

252
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,764
We should have this baby.

253
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:09,862
I was up all night long
thinking about it, okay?

254
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:12,971
I started reading stuff on the internet,
and this is a miracle.

255
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:15,659
- It's a blessing from God.
- What are you talking about?

256
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,532
Look, listen to me. I'm a C-7
incomplete quadriplegic, okay?

257
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:22,969
I have a 20% motility rate.

258
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:25,495
Most guys at my SCI do...

259
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:28,296
Like a normal guy would have,
like, 80% motility rate.

260
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,721
Even to get an erection with you,
had to go reflex instead of psychogenic,

261
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:35,345
which you were great with by the way.
I just thought I'd tell you that quick.

262
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:39,182
I didn't know I'd had enough duct
function to get sperm into the semen.

263
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,645
Look, point is,
my boys can swim.

264
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,147
Ever since this injury,
the worst thing

265
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,969
has been people telling me
I wouldn't be able to be a father.

266
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:49,679
But guess what?
I am.

267
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:53,572
You need to stop,
and go home, and get some sleep,

268
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:56,450
because you are freaking me out.

269
00:15:56,711 --> 00:15:59,078
We've to have this baby,
it might be my only chance.

270
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:03,040
You do not get to put that on me.

271
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,380
I mean...

272
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:09,059
I'm not some experiment
for you to prove your manhood, Jason.

273
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,219
I'm 19.

274
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:12,987
You're a frickin' car salesman
in a wheelchair,

275
00:16:13,227 --> 00:16:15,468
- never been to college.
- That's not the point.

276
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:17,790
It's absolutely the point, Jason.

277
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:21,521
This is my body
and I'm going to make...

278
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,810
I'm gonna make the ultimate decision.

279
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:27,982
You were a one-night stand,
for God's sake.

280
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:30,693
One of the greatest nights
of my life.

281
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:34,943
- I gotta go.
- No, Erin, don't.

282
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,037
Come on, don't...

283
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,269
Hey, man, we're in Dallas this weekend,
Houston the next.

284
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:48,669
It's open try-outs.
All you need is a pair of cleats.

285
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:50,526
And 60 bucks.

286
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:53,685
You expect me to pay to come
run around with a bunch of wannabes?

287
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:56,242
Hey, man, Arena football's
the real deal, man.

288
00:16:56,402 --> 00:16:58,971
Kurt Warner played in our league
before the Rams picked him up.

289
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:01,045
Come on, man.
I mean...

290
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:04,602
Y'all are running around inside
on a tiny field with a bunch of ness.

291
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:06,370
It's kind of a joke.

292
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,355
We're a fan's game.
You're right about that.

293
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:11,033
Average attendance is about 12,000.

294
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:13,469
We just signed
our new TV deal with ESPN.

295
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:16,230
Our guys are banking 42 grand a year

296
00:17:16,623 --> 00:17:18,741
for a 16-game season,
january to june.

297
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:20,846
- For real?
- Yeah.

298
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:24,037
Guy like you, come in, kick some ass,
become a franchise player.

299
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:27,749
You could double that in three
or four years. Plus health and housing.

300
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:29,334
You wanna play pro football?

301
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:31,642
This is your chance.

302
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:37,509
With the addition of this
state-of-the-art flying ambulance,

303
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,532
and this wonderful heliport
you're all standing on,

304
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,059
I'm proud to say that Dillon
Memorial Hospital is now officially

305
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,312
a level one trauma care facility.

306
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:52,871
And so, I'd like to ask
Mr. Morris McArnold,

307
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,610
the man who made this all possible,

308
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:59,469
to step forward and dedicate
this wonderful new aircraft.

309
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:00,629
Morris.

310
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,034
Thank you very much, Bob.

311
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:05,406
Let me just say...
I'll keep this brief.

312
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:07,998
As a third generation Dillon citizen,

313
00:18:08,342 --> 00:18:10,116
Dillon is in my heart,

314
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:13,879
my family's heart.
So it's a privilege for us

315
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,720
to be able to make this donation.

316
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,057
God bless you all
and thank you very much.

317
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:27,307
Good to see you.

318
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:29,617
- Good event.
- Great to see you.

319
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:32,856
There he is, there he is.

320
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:35,359
- Eric.
- Mo, how are you?

321
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,807
- Pleasure to see you.
- Pleasure's mine.

322
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,150
Congratulations.
Let's start with this right away.

323
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,699
State champion.
Congratulations. Proud of you.

324
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,118
- We got lucky.
- Real proud of you.

325
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:47,150
- Cheers. And to your daughter...
- Gracie.

326
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:51,087
Gracie. What a beautiful girl.
What the hell's it been? 15?

327
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:53,705
- It's been about 15.
- 15? Red light!

328
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,088
Red light.

329
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,595
- Red light!
- Green light, I gotcha.

330
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:00,718
- Hasn't changed a bit, huh?
- Yeah.

331
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:04,972
You two look great. You two look...
Not as great as this would look.

332
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:08,088
- You know it looks good.
- She looks better every day.

333
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,476
She sure does.

334
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:12,438
They got me on a schedule,
so I'm gonna say good-bye for now.

335
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:14,268
Are you gonna go up in the...

336
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:16,562
- In the thing?
- I've got some pictures...

337
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,862
But I'm gonna come to the game
on Friday night. I'm gonna be there.

338
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:22,975
- So I wish you the best of luck.
- That's fantastic.

339
00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:25,534
- Baby, you look great.
- I'll get you some nice seats.

340
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:27,713
- Get Mo some seats.
- Sit with me.

341
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:31,112
I'd like that. Get me a seat,
we'll sit together at the game.

342
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:33,292
We'll go to the game.
Thank you for coming.

343
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,001
- Thanks.
- You got a good one.

344
00:19:35,262 --> 00:19:37,337
You bring 'em hell.
And you bring 'em hell.

345
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:39,891
And you keep bringing them hell.
Gotcha.

346
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:41,925
- Okay, let's go.
- Congratulations.

347
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,637
Bye, take care.
So nice to see you.

348
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,329
I sure haven't missed him.

349
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:53,326
Blast from the past.

350
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:56,982
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Morris McArnold will now take</i>

351
00:19:57,242 --> 00:20:00,030
<i>the inaugural flight
in our new medevac helicopter.</i>

352
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:03,720
Here we go.

353
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:26,399
This was not supposed to happen,
all right?

354
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,817
I'm not supposed
to be able to do this.

355
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:32,101
She shouldn't be pregnant from me.

356
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:34,997
But she is, and...

357
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,319
this might be my only shot,
so I am ready to be a father.

358
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,580
You think I'm crazy.

359
00:20:41,878 --> 00:20:42,878
No.

360
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:47,033
- You're looking at me like I'm crazy.
- I've heard this conversation before.

361
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:49,733
Usually it's the other way around.
It's a scared kid trying...

362
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:51,348
To get out of it.
That's not me.

363
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:53,785
I'm not trying to get out of it,
but to get into it.

364
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:55,195
I'm trying to...

365
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:58,293
get her to listen to me
and have this baby.

366
00:20:58,453 --> 00:21:01,046
And the first time I talked to her,
I failed miserably.

367
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:03,469
First of all,
I don't have magic words for you.

368
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,470
It's not for me to convince her,
it's to you to find those words.

369
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,992
It's gonna probably be
the most serious conversation

370
00:21:09,152 --> 00:21:11,387
- you'll ever have in your life.
- I know.

371
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:17,855
I can tell you

372
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:21,899
that your children
and the mother of your children

373
00:21:22,263 --> 00:21:24,871
are the two most important things
in life.

374
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,691
- How old are you?
- I'm 19.

375
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:30,442
How old is she?

376
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,410
She's 19.

377
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,192
- How long you known her?
- Not long.

378
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:38,124
She's a...
She's a great girl.

379
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:41,674
She's just scared, you know?

380
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,094
I know that and I understand that.

381
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:45,763
I just...

382
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:49,725
Everything I know about women you could
stick in this damn coffee cup here.

383
00:21:49,885 --> 00:21:52,722
But I do know
you have to have trust and honesty.

384
00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:56,431
Without trust and honesty,
it is not gonna work.

385
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:01,276
I can't give you any answers.

386
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:03,192
You gotta make the answers.

387
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
I know.

388
00:22:07,638 --> 00:22:08,638
Thank you.

389
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:14,995
This is the Rigg Show.
We got a game tonight, South Pines.

390
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:17,433
Let's talk football,
about what's really happening.

391
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:18,999
Go ahead, you're on the air.

392
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:22,002
<i>I wanna know what it is
that you're gonna do to contribute</i>

393
00:22:22,711 --> 00:22:26,014
<i>to the salvation
of this championship season.</i>

394
00:22:26,174 --> 00:22:29,342
Know what? I'll tell you right now.
My character has never been questioned.

395
00:22:29,604 --> 00:22:31,469
So if you've ever been
to a game live,

396
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:35,432
you will understand
how I do what I do and why.

397
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:37,559
Man, this town
is crazy about football.

398
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:40,940
Actually, that's maybe
the second call he got about it.

399
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,707
The rest were girls
just trying to get a date.

400
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:44,941
Let's do it, cheers.

401
00:22:45,387 --> 00:22:46,443
Lorena.

402
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:49,467
<i>I was wondering if you wanted
to maybe hang out or catch a movie.</i>

403
00:22:49,627 --> 00:22:50,948
<i>I think you're really cute.</i>

404
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:53,867
<i>Your long hair
kind of reminds me of Jesus.</i>

405
00:22:54,328 --> 00:22:55,852
You've just been cut off.

406
00:22:56,012 --> 00:22:58,038
Thank you for calling,
that was ridiculous.

407
00:22:58,823 --> 00:23:01,100
Lucky Lauren, let's go.
You're on the air with Riggs.

408
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,307
<i>Hi, I was wondering what you think
about the whole Smash Williams incident.</i>

409
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:05,485
And what about it?

410
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:08,798
<i>I was wondering if you think it's okay
what he did, punching that man.</i>

411
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:12,969
You know what? I know Williams
probably better than anyone out there.

412
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:17,068
This guy is an honorable guy and he did
take action on something, you know,

413
00:23:17,228 --> 00:23:19,600
that I would've probably taken
even further if it were me.

414
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:21,894
<i>So you're saying it's okay
to hit somebody?</i>

415
00:23:22,447 --> 00:23:24,443
At times, yeah, I am.

416
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:26,607
We're gonna close this out now.

417
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,346
No regrets, 7:30 tonight South Pines.
Same old, same old.

418
00:23:30,506 --> 00:23:33,457
We're gonna get a big W tonight,
head into the playoffs and take State.

419
00:23:33,617 --> 00:23:34,992
That's it for now.
Cheers.

420
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:42,457
- Felt good.
- Yeah, man, not bad at all. Good work.

421
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,834
Man, can I talk to you for a second?

422
00:23:45,095 --> 00:23:46,095
Yeah, shoot.

423
00:23:46,255 --> 00:23:48,462
I know you like Lyla
and you're doing this show

424
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:51,424
to try and get under my skin.
I wanna let you know it won't work.

425
00:23:51,685 --> 00:23:53,093
Why would I try to do that?

426
00:23:53,353 --> 00:23:55,056
She's over you.
I wanted to let you know.

427
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:57,371
That's all I wanted to say to you
out of courtesy.

428
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:58,431
Okay?

429
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,476
Thanks, man, good luck tonight.
We'll listen to you on the radio.

430
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:04,895
Do you think she's gonna be thinking
of me or you while you listen to me?

431
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:07,815
- She's gonna be with me, so.
- You're not letting it register.

432
00:24:08,077 --> 00:24:09,401
- Go Panthers.
- Cheers.

433
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:13,885
Come in.

434
00:24:14,623 --> 00:24:17,102
- Hey, coach. You wanted to see me?
- I do. Come in.

435
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:19,012
Sit down. Close the door.

436
00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:25,537
I don't know what you planned tomorrow,
but I want you to change it.

437
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:28,253
- Come down to Whitmore with me.
- For what?

438
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,500
Scholarship.

439
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:33,819
Coach Deeks.
The offer is still good.

440
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:34,979
Whitmore?

441
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,325
That's like Siberia...

442
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:40,848
It's a damn fine school, first of all,
and they got a good coaching staff.

443
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:43,944
- They were 2 and 8 last year.
- Whitmore is one of the only schools

444
00:24:44,104 --> 00:24:48,564
that is still standing behind you after
this mess you've gotten yourself into.

445
00:24:48,937 --> 00:24:50,819
You think that accounts for something?

446
00:24:50,979 --> 00:24:52,519
- Yeah, but I...
- Yeah, but what?

447
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,445
An airplane's waiting for you tomorrow
to take you off to Lsu or Alabama maybe?

448
00:24:56,605 --> 00:24:58,199
Something I don't know about?

449
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,848
Is that what you're gonna be
doing tomorrow?

450
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:04,373
- No, sir.
- You didn't listen to me last time.

451
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:07,829
I'm asking you
to please listen to me this time.

452
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:11,132
Two years, maybe you'll transfer.
Hell, who knows?

453
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:14,132
You might be their first player
in ten years to make it to the draft.

454
00:25:15,032 --> 00:25:17,375
Coach Deeks seems to think
that's a possibility.

455
00:25:17,535 --> 00:25:18,594
Hell, I do too.

456
00:25:19,094 --> 00:25:21,890
You live up to your potential,
I don't see why it couldn't happen.

457
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:23,927
Just think about it.

458
00:25:25,478 --> 00:25:27,823
Get back to me
before the night's over.

459
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:29,397
Thanks.

460
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:31,702
I'll let you know.

461
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:48,162
<i>South Pines hasn't been able
to stop the Dillon offense.</i>

462
00:25:48,322 --> 00:25:51,261
<i>Tim Riggins goes in for the score.</i>

463
00:25:55,225 --> 00:25:56,518
<i>It's fourth quarter</i>

464
00:25:56,678 --> 00:25:59,177
<i>and looking like it's an easy win
for the Panthers tonight.</i>

465
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:02,888
Good team!
That boy's got a good team.

466
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:05,682
Second offense, let's go!
On me, let's go!

467
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:08,603
Listen up.
Wave, say hello to your folks,

468
00:26:09,507 --> 00:26:11,552
let's get out there
and let's kick some ass.

469
00:26:11,712 --> 00:26:14,024
Come on, let's have some fun.
Let's go!

470
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:15,288
Let's go!

471
00:26:16,427 --> 00:26:17,695
This oughta be good!

472
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:23,785
<i>31 to nothing.
It looks like coach Taylor</i>

473
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:26,204
<i>is mercifully sending in
some second stringers.</i>

474
00:26:26,464 --> 00:26:27,746
What you got for us?

475
00:26:28,008 --> 00:26:29,665
All right.
Hey, it's third down.

476
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:32,548
Landry, you wanna show Tyra
what you can do?

477
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,211
- Yeah.
- Here's the deal.

478
00:26:34,472 --> 00:26:37,256
Three in a pass formation,
it's gonna be tossed back to Landry.

479
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:39,068
On one, ready?
Break!

480
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:41,887
Make something happen!

481
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,517
Blue 80!
Hut!

482
00:26:50,905 --> 00:26:52,666
<i>Saracen's rolling out.</i>

483
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:55,734
<i>It's a jump pass to 85!</i>

484
00:26:56,427 --> 00:27:00,350
<i>Landry Clarke has got it,
and oh, he's got open field!</i>

485
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,047
<i>He's gonna score.</i>

486
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:05,594
<i>Touchdown,
Dillon Panthers once again!</i>

487
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:09,552
<i>And this has turned into
an old fashion whopping.</i>

488
00:27:10,704 --> 00:27:11,712
Who's that?

489
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:16,795
That's my baby boy!

490
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,592
<i>That end zone's been opened
all night long,</i>

491
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:24,137
<i>and Landry just walked in,
untouched!</i>

492
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,637
<i>45 to nothing
with eight seconds to play.</i>

493
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:33,197
<i>The only drama here</i>

494
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:36,815
<i>is whether South Pines can put
one in before this night is over.</i>

495
00:27:40,872 --> 00:27:44,615
<i>Hold on, something's up. Coach Taylor
is calling for a change on defense.</i>

496
00:27:45,157 --> 00:27:47,285
- You're giving them the middle.
- <i>They open up</i>

497
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:50,580
<i>a hole big enough for a semi.
Here's the snap.</i>

498
00:27:51,293 --> 00:27:54,668
<i>And he waltzes into the end zone.
Touchdown!</i>

499
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:57,306
<i>It's been a long hard night
for South Pines,</i>

500
00:27:57,466 --> 00:28:00,182
<i>and our coach Taylor
has lifted their spirits.</i>

501
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:02,592
<i>And he sends them home with a score.</i>

502
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,720
They had a shut out!

503
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:07,342
Coach!

504
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:11,357
Way to go, bud.
I'm proud of you.

505
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,344
Good game, baby.

506
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:19,183
- Great game.
- Oh, thanks!

507
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:20,777
- Great game.
- Thanks, Mo.

508
00:28:21,154 --> 00:28:23,488
Cheers. Come here, you.
Come here!

509
00:28:24,313 --> 00:28:26,074
There's the little one.
How you doing?

510
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,492
Sweetheart, bye.
See you soon.

511
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:30,120
I'll talk to you later.

512
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,947
Blew the shut out though.
You did blow the shut out.

513
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:35,625
Coach,
put the hammer down next time!

514
00:28:36,092 --> 00:28:37,988
- Bye.
- Come here, you.

515
00:28:38,148 --> 00:28:39,336
Come here, you.

516
00:28:47,474 --> 00:28:49,605
Running things pretty wide open.
West coast offense.

517
00:28:49,765 --> 00:28:52,392
That's what they call it now.
No offense to coach Walsh,

518
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:54,103
God rest him,

519
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:57,271
but we were running that down here
ten years before he was.

520
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:58,689
Speed and quickness.

521
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:01,535
- That's what we're looking for.
- Yes, sir.

522
00:29:01,695 --> 00:29:04,445
We don't have the size,
but we got the heart.

523
00:29:04,696 --> 00:29:08,033
And a guy like you,
see the field and make his cuts.

524
00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:10,732
That's exactly what we need.

525
00:29:14,978 --> 00:29:17,097
- What?
- I told your coach here,

526
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:19,794
six years ago, that I thought
you were the complete package,

527
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,784
mentally and physically.

528
00:29:21,944 --> 00:29:23,494
What?
Six years ago?

529
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:26,217
Oh, yeah, I saw you run
in the seventh grade, son.

530
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:27,926
And eighth grade.

531
00:29:28,241 --> 00:29:29,452
And your freshman year

532
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:32,098
when you went from JV to Varsity
after that Arnett mead game.

533
00:29:32,883 --> 00:29:35,852
Then old Taylor here comes along
lookin'at that Dillon job.

534
00:29:36,632 --> 00:29:39,182
And I said to him,
that Brian Williams...

535
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:41,941
Brian Williams's gonna be a star.
He'll make you one too.

536
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:43,757
You were right.

537
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:46,153
- Congratulations.
- Truth is, Williams,

538
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:48,646
I didn't think we had a shot at you.

539
00:29:48,882 --> 00:29:51,951
And if you want to keep looking,
we won't take it personal.

540
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:55,830
And I say we because
we're one big family here.

541
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:57,749
Let us know something, okay?

542
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:00,585
- I wanna thank you for coming down.
- Oh, thank you.

543
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:04,981
Thank you, coach.

544
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,510
Coach Deeks...

545
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:15,683
I'd like to make my official commitment
to play for Whitmore University, sir.

546
00:30:16,134 --> 00:30:18,478
You want to play ball with us?
Fine.

547
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,563
Come on over
and meet some of the fellas.

548
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,595
Okay, men.
Bring it in!

549
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:29,207
Okay, men.

550
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,990
This is Brian Williams.

551
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:33,361
He's gonna be joining us soon.

552
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:36,419
He's gonna be part of our family now.

553
00:30:36,823 --> 00:30:38,248
We wanna make him feel welcome.

554
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:45,130
He made us a reservation at <i>Carmelo's</i>.
You know, that new italian place.

555
00:30:45,895 --> 00:30:47,824
<i>He wants to take us
to a nice dinner.</i>

556
00:30:47,984 --> 00:30:50,051
It's the world's longest
business trip, isn't it?

557
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:51,135
What?

558
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:52,965
All right, fine.
You know what?

559
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,758
Let's at least go get barbecue.

560
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:57,516
- I don't wanna spend all night with Mo.
- <i>We don't have to go.</i>

561
00:30:57,778 --> 00:30:59,731
If you're gonna be crabby,
let's just not.

562
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,395
We'll do it next time he's in town.

563
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:04,941
No, no, it's fine. We'll go out,
we'll get it done, we'll do it.

564
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,735
Hey, hey, how did it go with Smash?

565
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,863
He's going to Whitmore.

566
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:13,407
<i>Oh, that's great news.
Will you please tell him</i>

567
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:15,743
congratulations from me.
Corrina must be thrilled.

568
00:31:16,184 --> 00:31:17,184
I will.

569
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:20,456
Listen, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later, all right?

570
00:31:20,718 --> 00:31:23,125
All right, I'll talk to you later, bye.

571
00:31:23,386 --> 00:31:26,029
He was Annabel Quimby's grandson.

572
00:31:26,546 --> 00:31:29,799
Yes, and I said, "I remember
when you were nothing but just a thought

573
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,634
in somebody's back yard."

574
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,514
Lyla, what college
are you thinking of applying to?

575
00:31:37,224 --> 00:31:39,559
I'll apply probably to Texas,

576
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:41,769
probably Baylor
'cause that's where my mom went.

577
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:44,897
But where I really want
to go is Princeton.

578
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,692
- Helena went to Princeton.
- Really?

579
00:31:48,498 --> 00:31:50,284
Cost me a small fortune,

580
00:31:50,885 --> 00:31:52,197
but it was well worth it.

581
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:54,531
Right, like that russian lit degree

582
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:57,619
is doing her a lot of good while
she's shopping for shoes at <i>Neiman's</i>.

583
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:32,299
No kidding, you two did it right.

584
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,967
You really did. You got married,
you got married properly.

585
00:32:36,127 --> 00:32:37,450
You married a good woman.

586
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,841
I just wanna raise a glass
to both of you.

587
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,246
Cheers.

588
00:32:41,406 --> 00:32:43,257
I guess the better man did win.

589
00:32:43,782 --> 00:32:46,626
To the love that is in there.
If we could just figure out

590
00:32:46,886 --> 00:32:48,753
- a way of getting to it.
- Absolutely.

591
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:52,662
God bless coaches like you
for making that kind of thing happen.

592
00:32:52,822 --> 00:32:54,804
Well that's just a very kind...

593
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:56,594
kind speech there, Mo.

594
00:32:59,253 --> 00:33:00,742
So fun to get together...

595
00:33:01,275 --> 00:33:02,468
We're not done.

596
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:05,763
We got Julie at home.
You haven't even met Julie.

597
00:33:05,923 --> 00:33:08,235
- How's everything?
- Bring us a bottle of good whisky.

598
00:33:08,395 --> 00:33:09,720
Just for the heck of it.

599
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,319
- We're gonna have to go home.
- Naw, I'll have a shot. It'll be great.

600
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:15,587
Honey, we got scotch at home.

601
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:17,198
Sweetheart?

602
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,494
And the check.
Thank you.

603
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:25,774
- I'll take the check.
- You can bring the check to me, please.

604
00:33:26,876 --> 00:33:29,627
- Here you go.
- Coach, good work. Proud of you.

605
00:33:30,158 --> 00:33:31,309
To lucky.

606
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:33,840
To lucky.

607
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:39,137
Well, they totally love you.

608
00:33:40,082 --> 00:33:42,758
I think my grandmother is
ready to start planning a wedding.

609
00:33:42,918 --> 00:33:45,893
- She's funny.
- I guess. You want some of this?

610
00:33:46,053 --> 00:33:47,134
Yeah, thanks.

611
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:48,479
She told Kelly once,

612
00:33:49,198 --> 00:33:51,649
"The bigger your hair,
the closer you are to God."

613
00:33:53,974 --> 00:33:55,724
I can see her saying that.

614
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:57,298
You can.

615
00:33:57,841 --> 00:33:59,032
I'm glad I came.

616
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,451
Yeah, me too.

617
00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:05,257
So, are we alone?

618
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,174
Pretty much.

619
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,251
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

620
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:53,936
Just...

621
00:34:56,613 --> 00:34:58,288
Can you hold that thought?

622
00:35:01,062 --> 00:35:04,597
You know how I feel about you. I don't
wanna do anything to mess it up, so...

623
00:35:11,104 --> 00:35:14,874
Even though it goes against every fiber
of my being, I think I should go.

624
00:35:18,508 --> 00:35:20,530
Are you okay?
Promise?

625
00:35:36,252 --> 00:35:40,057
Edward Butowski,
Abilene high school, 1998.

626
00:35:40,217 --> 00:35:43,052
He ran the exact same
triple stack offense, counters,

627
00:35:43,312 --> 00:35:46,222
halfback options. Coach,
you stole that offense from Butowski.

628
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:48,349
- I stole it.
- I never heard you thank him.

629
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:50,435
And from the Green Bay Packers, too.

630
00:35:51,056 --> 00:35:53,813
- Cheers to stealing.
- Cheers to liars.

631
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:57,650
- Cheers to liars
- There we go. We both agree to that.

632
00:35:58,015 --> 00:36:01,320
- Great. Let's head on home now...
- No, no.

633
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:04,741
- Let's go on home.
- Let's talk about something else

634
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:07,451
that you stole.
This little lady right here.

635
00:36:07,611 --> 00:36:09,488
That's ridiculous.
Come on now, y'all.

636
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:13,499
You look me in the eye
and you tell me you were not calling her

637
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:16,565
behind my back and telling her
I was sleeping with Bellita Elizabeth.

638
00:36:16,725 --> 00:36:17,875
Say it, can you?

639
00:36:18,035 --> 00:36:21,048
This is ridiculous, Mo.
I knew you were sleeping with her.

640
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:23,634
That's it. That's the last one.
We're going right now.

641
00:36:23,894 --> 00:36:25,803
- You're stupid.
- To stealers and liars.

642
00:36:26,063 --> 00:36:29,140
- Come on, y'all. Seriously.
- Red light?

643
00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:30,549
Red light.

644
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:32,018
Stop it!

645
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:39,400
You stole her!
Admit it!

646
00:36:42,538 --> 00:36:44,388
I'll see you at home, honey.

647
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:49,105
Get your coat.

648
00:36:49,703 --> 00:36:50,775
Where's dad?

649
00:36:50,935 --> 00:36:52,744
He's not coming.

650
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,390
If he's not going to church,
I'm not going to church.

651
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,054
Well you could go right on in there
and tell him if you like.

652
00:36:59,214 --> 00:37:00,588
Let's all go.
Come on.

653
00:37:00,848 --> 00:37:03,800
If I've to get up and get out of bed
and go to church, so do you.

654
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:06,974
Hi, honey.
Just your three girls here,

655
00:37:07,245 --> 00:37:09,597
wanting to see if you wanna come
to church with us, hon.

656
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,474
What happened to your face?

657
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:15,645
- I was defending your mama's honor.
- With your face?

658
00:37:15,905 --> 00:37:18,106
No, he was being an idiot.

659
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,873
- Get me some aspirin please?
- No, honey, we're going to church.

660
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:25,144
Sorry, we gotta run. Love you.
Say bye to your daddy.

661
00:37:25,304 --> 00:37:26,641
- Bye, dad.
- Good-bye.

662
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:29,149
- Yell "bye" louder.
- Bye, dad!

663
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:32,203
Bye, honey!
We'll miss ya!

664
00:37:32,642 --> 00:37:34,437
Oh, I love you too.

665
00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:41,629
Great job, yesterday.
The coach and all the boys.

666
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:44,882
- We're looking forward to playoffs.
- Oh, yeah. It's coming up.

667
00:37:45,142 --> 00:37:47,761
- Hello, Ms. Garrity.
- How you doing?

668
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:48,939
Bless you.

669
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:52,140
- So how's the ranch?
- The ranch was great.

670
00:37:52,612 --> 00:37:54,078
Oh, really?

671
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,227
Yeah, really. His family's awesome.

672
00:37:56,676 --> 00:37:58,354
He was a perfect gentlemen.

673
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:01,774
You're really gonna come
every Sunday?

674
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:04,277
Yeah, of course.
Whatever it takes.

675
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:06,404
Ms. McGowan.

676
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:09,448
- How are you?
- Good morning, Timothy.

677
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:11,890
Good morning.
How are you this morning?

678
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,287
- I'm wonderful. And you?
- I'm great.

679
00:38:14,552 --> 00:38:16,350
- Would you care to join us?
- I can't.

680
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,832
- Yeah, you can.
- No.

681
00:38:18,092 --> 00:38:20,293
Yes, you can.
Just sit beside us.

682
00:38:20,553 --> 00:38:22,226
I'll see you later, Tim.

683
00:38:22,612 --> 00:38:24,362
All right, suit yourself.

684
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:42,499
Baby?

685
00:38:43,123 --> 00:38:45,067
Dinner'll be ready
in about half an hour.

686
00:38:45,675 --> 00:38:47,293
You finish your homework?

687
00:38:47,612 --> 00:38:49,851
Yeah. I'll be right down.

688
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,741
Baby, you all right?

689
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:53,889
I'm fine, ma.

690
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:58,329
You know your auntie Shay
called this morning.

691
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:01,039
She told me to tell you
congratulations.

692
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:04,962
You know how proud we are of you?

693
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,692
You're going to college, boy,
on a full scholarship.

694
00:39:10,966 --> 00:39:11,968
Listen...

695
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,430
I know Whitmore isn't
what you dreamed of.

696
00:39:16,051 --> 00:39:18,684
But honey, when a door closes,

697
00:39:18,944 --> 00:39:20,311
God opens a window.

698
00:39:20,987 --> 00:39:23,078
He don't never fumble
the ball, baby.

699
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:25,964
He always gets the touchdown.
That's God's plan.

700
00:39:27,613 --> 00:39:29,862
Now you're gonna get
a good education, Brian.

701
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:32,907
You're gonna be
the star of their team.

702
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,190
It's gonna be all right.

703
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:40,195
I'm gonna go and finish
frying this chicken.

704
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:42,308
And I got your favorite dessert.

705
00:39:44,487 --> 00:39:48,038
I knew that'd put a smile on your face.
You come on up out this room.

706
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:49,340
Come on.

707
00:40:00,444 --> 00:40:03,271
There's probably a million reasons
why this is a bad idea,

708
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:06,093
and I get that. I completely do
and I know you have to start

709
00:40:06,253 --> 00:40:09,139
with, like, number one being
how I acted the other day.

710
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:11,362
That was totally inappropriate, Jason.

711
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:12,897
I need that job.

712
00:40:13,322 --> 00:40:14,323
I'm sorry.

713
00:40:14,986 --> 00:40:18,968
It's just that nothing like this
has ever really happened to me before.

714
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,122
So I might've overreacted
a little bit.

715
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:22,739
A lot.

716
00:40:25,037 --> 00:40:26,924
All I'm asking you...

717
00:40:27,674 --> 00:40:29,921
is to not, like...

718
00:40:30,738 --> 00:40:32,300
make a brash decision here.

719
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:34,481
Think about it
just for a little bit.

720
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:37,179
Jason, I have thought about it
every which way.

721
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:40,891
It's so weird.
I already feel my body changing.

722
00:40:41,362 --> 00:40:44,937
I've got cramps,
and I'm tired all the time.

723
00:40:45,842 --> 00:40:47,606
I mean, it sucks.

724
00:40:48,088 --> 00:40:50,175
I understand what you're saying.

725
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:53,599
But it makes sense. Think about it.
There's a little...

726
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:54,780
baby in there.

727
00:40:55,304 --> 00:40:57,895
A little person's in there:
little fingers,

728
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,202
and little toes,
and a little heartbeat.

729
00:41:00,932 --> 00:41:03,768
He's got his eyes all scrunched up.
He's in a ball.

730
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,781
Maybe he's got a wee-wee,
Maybe he doesn't.

731
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:09,045
Aren't you the least bit curious?

732
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:12,162
You got a human life in there.

733
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:17,094
You're not one of those people
that blows up clinics, are you?

734
00:41:17,428 --> 00:41:19,488
I'm just saying it could be...

735
00:41:19,648 --> 00:41:21,893
That little person
could be the next Bill Gates

736
00:41:22,053 --> 00:41:23,726
or the next Peyton Manning...

737
00:41:23,986 --> 00:41:26,490
Or Britney Spears
with a learning disorder,

738
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:28,393
if that's not redundant.

739
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,733
No way.
Not on my watch.

740
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,837
Oh, God.

741
00:41:35,017 --> 00:41:36,284
Look, Erin...

742
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:39,716
I understand.

743
00:41:41,178 --> 00:41:42,414
This right here

744
00:41:42,574 --> 00:41:45,915
could be the most important decision
that we'll ever make.

745
00:41:46,427 --> 00:41:49,168
And if you choose
to give this a chance,

746
00:41:50,616 --> 00:41:52,275
I will be there with you.

747
00:41:53,145 --> 00:41:54,148
Every day.

748
00:41:55,115 --> 00:41:57,093
You won't be the only one
loving him.

749
00:41:57,756 --> 00:41:58,756
100%.

750
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:01,722
Anything you ask,

751
00:42:01,982 --> 00:42:04,767
anything you need, day-in, day-out.
I'll be there.

752
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:06,705
Really?

753
00:42:07,905 --> 00:42:10,212
Give it some time.
Give it a shot.

754
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,584
Please.

755
00:42:16,312 --> 00:42:19,339
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty please.

756
00:42:21,344 --> 00:42:23,055
So give it a chance.
