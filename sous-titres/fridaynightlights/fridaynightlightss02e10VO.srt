1
00:00:00,892 --> 00:00:05,356
Franckly, you're not a mother.
You have no idea what was the situation.

2
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:09,116
Sometime, we're gonna have a whole
conversation where you don't say that.

3
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:11,544
- You come out of there.
- You gotta calm down.

4
00:00:11,813 --> 00:00:14,771
You don't just open the door.
This is not your house anymore.

5
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:19,752
What I say you had to do to stay here?
Did I tell you how to feed the furrets?

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,345
<i>You take care of yourself,
everything else take care of itself.</i>

7
00:00:23,863 --> 00:00:25,704
They're not pressing charges.

8
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:36,305
<i>We're interupting your programing
for some important wheater information</i>

9
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:38,365
<i>from the south west regional
wheater center.</i>

10
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:40,451
<i>They've issued
a severe thunder storm warning</i>

11
00:00:40,713 --> 00:00:42,226
<i>for Hart and Reed counties</i>

12
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:45,229
<i>and a tornado watch continues
for Alan and Carr counties.</i>

13
00:00:45,849 --> 00:00:48,469
- <i>Very heavy rainfall.</i>
- I know that look.

14
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:50,820
- Someone's hungry.
- I know that, it's time.

15
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,017
Come one baby.
Thank you.

16
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:55,793
Would you something nice?
Oh my God.

17
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:59,553
I'm out of formula.
You are such a little pig, you know?

18
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,358
You eat so much, you gotta stop.

19
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:03,428
What happens
when you shame people with food?

20
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:07,130
- What ?
- Anorexia. Especially in girls.

21
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:08,961
Thank you, Oprah.
Very helpful.

22
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:12,457
- Okay, maybe I did see it on Oprah.
- Oh, busted.

23
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:14,964
I don't know
what I'm gonna do because...

24
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:18,585
I mean, Shelly's boobies,
there're not gonna do the trick, right?

25
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:22,202
I'll go to the store.

26
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:25,162
- I don't want you to go in this weather.
- See you soon.

27
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,923
God, he's cute. No, but he's jailbait.
We stay away, okay darling?

28
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:40,991
I'm heading to the store,
you need anything?

29
00:01:42,323 --> 00:01:43,847
Can I go with you?

30
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:52,523
So, are you going to the dance,
this week-end?

31
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:54,775
Are you going to fall formal?

32
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:59,583
No, I'm not going.
Are you?

33
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:04,708
No. I mean, it's kinda lame, right?

34
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,822
So I heard, Matty dumped
that cheerleader, is that true?

35
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:14,858
I don't know, I mean,
we don't talk.

36
00:02:21,522 --> 00:02:23,137
It cleared up pretty good.

37
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,482
Let's go!

38
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,770
What are you doing?

39
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:37,028
Nothing. Let's go.

40
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:39,519
She's gonna teeth soon, right?

41
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,577
Yeah, in like a year.

42
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:47,953
<i>... tornado warning from the south west

47
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:13,103
Hey, it's a tornado!
Everybody gets away from the glass!

48
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,834
Come here!
Leave it!

49
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:21,637
Get down!

50
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:33,586

51
00:03:33,862 --> 00:03:35,303

56
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:24,274
All right,
I'll see you later this afternoon. Bye.

57
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:25,705
Y'all, listen to this.

58
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,357
The school...
The high school in Laribee...

59
00:04:28,987 --> 00:04:30,851
That whole... half of that school

60
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:33,590
got completely lifted up
and knocked out by the tornado.

61
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:36,592
All those people are displaced.
What's going on with the TV?

62
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:38,939
- It's not working.
- Why?

63
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:40,864
- The cable's out.
- Oh, my lord.

64
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:43,224
I mean, those poor people are just...

65
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,965
What's going on?

66
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:52,911
Oh, come on.

67
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,349
Are you ki...
Get ready for school, please. Right now.

68
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:58,610
You are seriously no fun whatsoever.

69
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,085
Oh, I know. I'm so boring.

70
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,921
- And you, really?
- What?

71
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,712
Then I'll talk to you
when I get over there.

72
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:08,872
All right.

73
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,781
All right, good-bye.

74
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,607
That was our fearless leader
principal Brecker.

75
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:15,867
This storm has screwed everything up.

76
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:18,240
He wants to let the Laribee team

77
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:20,551
use our practice field
and our locker room.

78
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,527
- What is wrong with this TV?
- Cable's out.

79
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:24,276
What do you mean cable's out?

80
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:27,048
- How long is Tim Riggins gonna be here?
- A couple days.

81
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,021
- How long has the cable been out?
- Well, since the tornado.

82
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:33,327
You know, I don't necessarily think
this is gonna work out so well.

83
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:35,913
Having Riggins here
with our 16-year-old daughter

84
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:38,952
it's like putting a can of gasoline
right next to a lit match.

85
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:41,276
He'll only stay for a few days.
The kid's in trouble,

86
00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:43,389
he needs a place to stay.
What're you gonna do?

87
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:46,965
I like having another guy around here,
'cause it evens up the gender team.

88
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:49,042
- It's sort of nice.
- There are no teams.

89
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:52,078
- It's not about teams here.
- You know what would be nice?

90
00:05:52,238 --> 00:05:54,563
It'd be nice to show
a little bit more christian charity.

91
00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:57,982
I am made of christian charity.
Now, that's not the issue at all.

92
00:06:04,593 --> 00:06:05,946
How'd you sleep?

93
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:08,487
- I slept good.
- Good.

94
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:11,897
- You?
- I'm good.

95
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:14,646
Just wanted to come in and talk to you.

96
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:16,140
Okay.

97
00:06:20,165 --> 00:06:21,569
Guess who's got engaged!

98
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:23,622
Who?

99
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:27,727
Me.

100
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:31,426
It's beautiful.

101
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:34,201
Kevin and I are geting married.

102
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:35,953
He proposed last night.

103
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:40,068
I love him.

104
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:43,353
Sweetie.

105
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:44,515
Congratulations.

106
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:46,525
That's great.

107
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,735
Let's go, let's go!

108
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:51,238
Grab that bag! Check that bag!
Is that yours?

109
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,137
It's gonna be a good Friday,

110
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:55,217
Football in Texas
is what it's all about.

111
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:58,870
- So how long are these guys gonna stay?
- As long as they need to.

112
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:01,296
That's awkward,
considering you're district rivals

113
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:03,931
- and you play these guys two weeks.
- What should we do?

114
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,155
Send them on their way?
We're not gonna do that.

115
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:08,206
The one with the hair is Eddie.

116
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:11,088
What's he got, a twin?

117
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,955
From the wrong end of the gene pool.

118
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:15,262
We're gonna be good hosts
and good guests.

119
00:07:15,524 --> 00:07:17,174
I've kno coach Dickes for a long time.

120
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:20,314
As long as he don't stir things up,
everything will work out just fine.

121
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,860
- I'd give anything for that hair.
- Get out of here.

122
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,973
Napoleon dynamite.

123
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:29,596
- Who's the dude behind him?
- His older brother, QB1.

124
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,737
Thinks he's God's gift.

125
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,859
Can'stand that dude.

126
00:07:42,384 --> 00:07:47,336
Who do you think we are, Tyra?
You think we're the Sharks or the Jets?

127
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,255
You know, West Side Story?
You got two rival gangs,

128
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:54,580
The town's not big enough
for the both of them. It's a classic.

129
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,766
You never heard of West Side Story?

130
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:59,440
No. Don'think I want to, either.
You never ever...

131
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,229
Well, you're missing out.

132
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:04,686
Can you hand me one of your napkins
that you're holding over there?

133
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:06,801
I only have four napkins.

134
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:09,192
Don't make fun of me.
'cause I'm neat.

135
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:13,245
I don't know how to eat this.

136
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:20,251
- What?
- What are you doing?

137
00:08:22,777 --> 00:08:25,178
- Nothing.
- You just grabed my hand.

138
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:28,794
I just thought that...

139
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:32,589
You know,
since this is all finally over, we could

140
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:35,967
free us up so we could finally
just hang out, whatever.

141
00:08:36,452 --> 00:08:41,175
Yeah, look, I'm sorry. I'm just,
you know, just in a really bad mood.

142
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:43,944
And this food is horrendous.
So...

143
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:48,318
I'm gonna go.

144
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,190
I'll call you later.

145
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,608
All right?
Okay.

146
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:23,095
Is this fun? This is fun.

147
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,686
- It is fun.
- Lot of fun.

148
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,925
The most fun we've had together
in a long time.

149
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:30,526
- Relaxing, it's perfect.
- OK, dad. I'm sorry.

150
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:34,901
I feel like there's a big elephant
in the room

151
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:36,450
you're not talking about.

152
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,681
There's a big elephant right over there.

153
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:40,847
What elephant?
What are you talking about?

154
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:44,359
Mom and Kevin's wedding, Maybe
they're getting married over Christmas.

155
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,462
- I don't know.
- Wait. What did you just say?

156
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:47,998
What did you just say?

157
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,708
Mom and Kevin's wedding.

158
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:52,328
What are you telling me?

159
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:56,214
- That's not funny
- She didn't tell you?

160
00:09:59,442 --> 00:10:01,678
Are you telling me that mom told you

161
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,742
she's gonna marry
that little treehugger?

162
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:05,730
Is that what you're telling me?

163
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:13,332
Dad.

164
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,615
Dad!

165
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:20,886
God!

166
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,077
Listen up!
Here's how this is gonna work out.

167
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,292
We gonna split this up and take shifts
between the practice field,

168
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,958
the showers and the weight room.
We got one locker room.

169
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,451
That means we're gonna be sharing.
I don't wanna hear any guff about it.

170
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:37,453
How about the visitor's locker?

171
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:39,738
Girls soccer got
the visitor's locker room.

172
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:42,037
Kick 'em out.
You're the athletic director.

173
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:45,553
All right. Now listen:
after final bell at 4:30

174
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:49,080
one team's gonna take the practice field
while the other'll take the weight room

175
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,186
- and the film room, all right?
- I don't know, Coach.

176
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:55,524
It's gonna be difficult to get
a 90-minute cycle in with what you got.

177
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:58,652
- What do you mean, what we got?
- The weight room's too small.

178
00:10:58,812 --> 00:11:00,514
And hell, some of the machines...

179
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:03,937
Well, I guess my wife could probably use
some of the machines.

180
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,701
They may not even
be good enough for your wife,

181
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:10,188
but they're good enough
for a State championship last year.

182
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,457
Alright, quiet. Hey, quiet!

183
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,544
That's a fair point.

184
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,319
You know, maybe if you
would have stayed at TMU,

185
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:20,991
you might have won one in college, too.

186
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:27,464
Welcome to Dillon.
It's our privilege to have you here.

187
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:30,401
We are your hosts.
Understood?

188
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:33,774
Y'all know what's going on today?

189
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:34,934
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:37,436
All right, I think we're all understood.

191
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:44,393
I'm trying to help him out, and all
he does is keep bitching and moaning.

192
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:47,824
He's pissing me off.
He's like coach crybaby.

193
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:51,189
No, I'll tell you what I wanna do.
What I wanna do is to crush that team

194
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:52,924
and take that ball after the game

195
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:55,409
and I wanna shove it up
the s.o.b.'s rear end.

196
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,930
All right.

197
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:01,355
- What are you doing out here?
- Fixing the cable.

198
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:03,174
Just trust me.

199
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,842
Whatever you hear out here,
that stays here, all right?

200
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,876
It's on now!

201
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:14,123
Good job.

202
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,815
Tim Riggins was, like, holding you?

203
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:22,763
Like, holding me. Like, protecting me.
Not like, oh, I love you.

204
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:25,593
- What does he smell like?
- No, really, Lois...

205
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,662
That's, like, pathetic.
Like, here's you and there's pathetic.

206
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:30,420
You're going below yourself.

207
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:34,136
- How y'all doin?
- We're in the middle of something here.

208
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,440
You can finish talking.
I just got a quick question.

209
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,543
I'll be in the bathroom.

210
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:47,844
Basically I'm coming to you despite
what you did to my best friend

211
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:50,388
because I have a question

212
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,140
kind of in the female arena.

213
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:55,750
And I need to know:
are you still friends with Tyra Colette?

214
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:57,397
Last I checked...

215
00:12:58,074 --> 00:13:01,106
This is kind of a sensitive area here.

216
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:03,725
Kind of on a need-to-know basis only.

217
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:05,599
'Cause me and Tyra have kind of a,

218
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:06,914
beautil,

219
00:13:08,437 --> 00:13:09,658
like, a thing.

220
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,010
So you and Tyra have a beautiful thing?

221
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:15,235
And basically, I'm taking her
to the dance on Friday.

222
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:19,882
I needed to know if it should be a rose
or a carnation in terms of a corsage.

223
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:23,254
OK. So you're taking Tyra Colette
to the fall formal?

224
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:24,839
Does she know that?

225
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:29,296
That was funny.
Look, I realize that

226
00:13:29,564 --> 00:13:33,050
our relationship may be
a little bit over your head.

227
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:37,815
If it's a question about a flower
for her, why don't you just go ask her?

228
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:42,790
OK, I have a math test in 30 minutes
and I really need to study for it.

229
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:55,535
- I'm Chip.
- That's nice.

230
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,836
What do you say we go somewhere
and get you out of those wet clothes?

231
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:05,368
If you ever touch me again,

232
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,639
I'll kick you so hard
your balls'll be nonexistent, all right?

233
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:10,286
I like that.

234
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:13,356
Heard you guys got a dance next week.

235
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,562
- You wanna go with me?
- No.

236
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:17,949
Why? You got a boyfriend, don't you?

237
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,145
Of course you do. Look at you.

238
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:22,370
- You're beautiful.
- Bye, Chip.

239
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:27,850
Will you please go to the dance with me,
unnamed goddess girl?

240
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:33,632
- Unnamed goddess girl? Who's that?
- Some douchebag named Chip.

241
00:14:34,622 --> 00:14:36,188
Who names their kid Chip, anyway?

242
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:39,752
I don't know. It's kind of corny.
But, I mean, he's decent.

243
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:44,836
OK, Landry came up and talk to me today
about asking you to the dance.

244
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:47,920
And wondered whether
you like roses or carnations.

245
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:54,772
If I tell you something,
do you promise to keep it private?

246
00:14:55,947 --> 00:14:58,558
You mean about you and Landry
and your thing?

247
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:00,777
Wait, how'd you hear that?

248
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:04,390
I heard it. I mean, it's not like
it's flying all over school or anything.

249
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,692
But personnally, I had you pegged more
for an orchid kind of girl.

250
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:10,381
- Maybe like, a purple...
- Okay, it's reay not a thing.

251
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:13,466
You know, it's a lot more
complicated than that.

252
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:16,373
So do you like him?

253
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:22,373
I don't know, I mean, he cares about me
and he's funny and sweet.

254
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,656
Funny.

255
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:29,096
So then what's the problem?

256
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:39,432
Yo, Smash, check it out.
Check it out, man.

257
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:42,933
Oh yeah, that's real funny.
That's real funny.

258
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,493
Yo, guys, check it out.

259
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:01,037
Here we go.
Hey, here we go, guys.

260
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:02,789
We'll show 'em what's up.

261
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:04,943
- Yeah, baby!
- They did it to us!

262
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:07,248
Works both ways, gentlemen.

263
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:21,891
What the hell are you doing?

264
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,679
The hell you doing to my locker room?

265
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,757
- Look what they did...
- Shut up!

266
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:30,441
You clean it up right now!

267
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:34,097
You clean everithing up,
you put it back exactly where it was.

268
00:16:34,374 --> 00:16:35,696
You understand me?

269
00:16:36,918 --> 00:16:38,042
Now!

270
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:44,936
I don't understand why we gotta sit
and wait around for them

271
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,815
- to finish their practice on our field.
- For sure.

272
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:49,470
Oh, no! Rod!

273
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:53,891
What is that? Get over here!
Come here! You don't like the helmet.

274
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:55,916
Is it the pads in general?

275
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:58,629
Something you don't like,
you gotta tell me!

276
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,639
Coach, it's past 4:45.

277
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:03,299
What? Already?

278
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:04,858
Waow, look it there.

279
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:08,938
- Y'all need to wrap it up, coach.
- Okay, all right. We'll wrap it up.

280
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,237
I'd appreciate it too
if you'd tell your players

281
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,180
to respect our boys' property
and stay out of our lockers.

282
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:15,640
Come on now, Eric.

283
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,662
It was probably
just some harmless prank.

284
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:21,185
I tell you something.
I don't mind being a good neighbor

285
00:17:21,462 --> 00:17:23,264
as long as y'all play your part as well.

286
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,754
You don't, something's gonna
happen around here.

287
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:27,979
and I'd like to avoid that situation.

288
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:30,985
Let's get off the field, boys!

289
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:33,338
These ladies want their dance floor.

290
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,631
Everybody up!

291
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:36,654
What are you drinking?
Dr. Pepper, alright.

292
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:38,968
You got it. I'll be right back, y'all.

293
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,679
Excuse me, ma'am,
but my riblets are cold,

294
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:43,306
and it unacceptable.

295
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:47,135
You always use that one. Might wanna
come up with something original.

296
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:50,024
I don't use that every...
I guess I do use it every time.

297
00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:52,398
I should probably come up
with some new material.

298
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:57,473
All right, I just wanna say I'm sorry
about what happened the other day.

299
00:17:58,432 --> 00:18:01,491
Holding your hand, that was stupid.
I know you're not into pda.

300
00:18:01,753 --> 00:18:05,828
And I wasn't thinking.
I just wanna say that I'm sorry.

301
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,520
I'm in the weeds right now.
I can't really talk about this.

302
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,751
I know, I just wanna ask you something.
It'll just take a second.

303
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,213
I think that we should
go to the dance on Friday.

304
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:21,151
Well, it's a bye week, and
we don't have a game on Friday, so...

305
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:24,258
I figured a lot of people are
going to dry creek before.

306
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:28,654
- So we could start the party there.
- I don't think I'd be interested.

307
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:31,104
Tyra, these are our golden years here.

308
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:34,273
And these high school memories
are what we're gonna have to draw on

309
00:18:34,535 --> 00:18:38,118
- when we're old and in nursing home.
- not really selling the pot for me.

310
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:40,594
I know how this works,
you're gonna keep telling me no,

311
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:43,193
you gonna play hard to get
and I'm gonna keep asking you.

312
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:45,326
But you wanna go.
You owe it to yourself.

313
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:48,375
- I can't go with you.
- Why? We'd have fun.

314
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:51,351
I'm going with somebody else.

315
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:57,876
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:11,018
All right, well...

317
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:27,568
- Hey.
- Hey, Shelly!

318
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,741
Hi, what's going on?
Hello, darling.

319
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:32,797
Pretty good.

320
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:39,615
No, sir, not in this house.

321
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:41,924
Put that away, please. Thank you.

322
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,305
So bad.

323
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:56,481
50 bucks to finish this essay.

324
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:59,489
- Okay?
- Come on. You've got to be kidding.

325
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:01,974
You're doing that in front of me?
I don't think so.

326
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:04,651
I've got homework.
I've got ten pages

327
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,783
on transfer of title.
Lucky me.

328
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:19,242
- I wonder who's on Oprah.
- There is a great call.

329
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:22,044
No, we're working here.
Now, don't turn the tv on.

330
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:26,236
We're working here. The baby asleep,
and I don't want the tv on right now

331
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:27,704
to watch Oprah.

332
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:32,974
- What is that?
- Oh, my God!

333
00:20:33,237 --> 00:20:34,519
That's not Oprah.

334
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:36,771
- Turn it off!
- That's my bad,

335
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,882
It's supposed to be football.

336
00:20:39,768 --> 00:20:40,773
I'm sorry.

337
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:45,488
You know what, y'all, get out.
I gotta get work done. Get out.

338
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,852
Everybody out.

339
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:48,152
Go in your room.

340
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:50,159
I'll block that channel
when I come back.

341
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:52,829
- That would be a big help.
- Good luck with your paper.

342
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:57,083
- Shelly, just go. I need quiet.
- You're sending me to my room?

343
00:20:57,345 --> 00:21:00,794
- Until you start acting like a grownup.
- Don't try to tell me you're not gonna

344
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:03,467
watch that tonight, because I know you.

345
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:09,320
Donald Dickes is a little jackass.

346
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:11,384
He's just trying to get under your skin.

347
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,696
- He's getting under my skin.
- Don't let him.

348
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,559
Don't sweat the small stuff.
That's what my dad used to say.

349
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:20,980
Did you hear about Pam
getting re-married?

350
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:26,099
She's getting married?

351
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,201
- You all right? I mean...
- No.

352
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:35,198
I mean, that woman
is the love of my life, Eric.

353
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:38,360
I mean, we've`known each other
our whole lives.

354
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:42,592
She was there in the stands watching me
win the state championship.

355
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:44,995
I married her right after high school.
You know that.

356
00:21:45,155 --> 00:21:48,475
We opened this little car lot together
that little bitty place, remember?

357
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:50,845
We used to work together as a team.

358
00:21:51,107 --> 00:21:53,014
I'd sell, you know,

359
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:55,632
and Pam would do the contracts.
And she'd always say:

360
00:21:55,902 --> 00:21:58,740
"Buddy,
you could sell a pig to a priest."

361
00:22:00,422 --> 00:22:03,310
I don't even know what that means,
but I'll always...

362
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,649
I love that.

363
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,880
So... I guess...

364
00:22:10,826 --> 00:22:12,126
What do you think

365
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,196
I should do?

366
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,801
Well, you're right.
I mean, here I am five years in a row,

367
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:23,340
I'm the Texas car salesman the year.

368
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,338
I'm a salesman.

369
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,298
I oughta be able to sell own wife.

370
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,221
I'm gonna go over there,
and I'm gonna sell her.

371
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:34,263
I'm gonna get my wife back, by God.

372
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:36,462
That's what I'm gonna do.

373
00:22:37,452 --> 00:22:38,457
Thank you.

374
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:44,198
This is the best.
Barbeque pit.

375
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:48,819
So, um, is it true that rally girls
really do all of your homework?

376
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:51,772
You mean Mrs. Taylor's daughter. No.

377
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,867
- I do all my homework.
- Liar.

378
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:56,129
It's true.

379
00:23:04,703 --> 00:23:06,921
Do you wanna go get ice cream or,

380
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:08,839
I don't know, some more food?

381
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:10,435
I don't really care.

382
00:23:10,782 --> 00:23:12,200
- No.
- Why ?

383
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:18,294
Hey, Seven.

384
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:20,191
What's up?

385
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:22,736
Hi. Hey, Carlotta.

386
00:23:23,797 --> 00:23:26,031
We're just picking up food, so...

387
00:23:26,643 --> 00:23:28,174
We're just leaving.

388
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:33,855
- See you around, though.
- Yeah, man.

389
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:53,944
Hey, Buddy.

390
00:23:56,153 --> 00:23:58,103
- Pam.
- She's here.

391
00:23:58,263 --> 00:24:00,250
Yeah, just talk to her
for a second.

392
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,814
It's no big deal.
I don't need to come in.

393
00:24:05,032 --> 00:24:06,032
Hey, babe.

394
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,880
- It's OK.
- OK?

395
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,358
Just give me a minute.

396
00:24:09,702 --> 00:24:11,815
He can be there. I don't care.

397
00:24:14,316 --> 00:24:15,573
What do you want?

398
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:17,729
I want you, baby.

399
00:24:18,574 --> 00:24:19,795
I love you.

400
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:23,798
I have always loved you, Pam.
You know that.

401
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,125
We've always loved each other.

402
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:29,004
You must forgive me.

403
00:24:30,155 --> 00:24:33,341
You are the mother of my children.
You are my wife.

404
00:24:34,142 --> 00:24:37,119
I swear I...
I know what I've done.

405
00:24:37,855 --> 00:24:41,808
I was an idiot but it doesn't mean
I ever stopped loving you, Pam.

406
00:24:42,987 --> 00:24:44,810
I swear to God, Pam.

407
00:24:45,072 --> 00:24:49,273
I swear to God almighty,
I would never hurt you again.

408
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,970
Or the kids.

409
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,596
I've hurt you so much, baby.

410
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,446
Wait, and...

411
00:24:58,516 --> 00:24:59,643
I love you.

412
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,246
Buddy, I love you too.

413
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,748
Yes.

414
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:08,604
But it's over, okay?

415
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:12,587
I'm happy now.

416
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,300
Just...

417
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:20,346
It's gonna be okay, all right?

418
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:24,543
Pam.

419
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:27,061
Don't. Don't.

420
00:25:27,323 --> 00:25:28,145
Please?

421
00:25:29,388 --> 00:25:30,189
Pam.

422
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,397
I'm sorry.

423
00:26:03,336 --> 00:26:04,765
What are y'all doing?

424
00:26:05,905 --> 00:26:08,356
Wh the...
Hey hey hey! What the hell?

425
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:10,312
What the hell is going on?

426
00:26:10,574 --> 00:26:13,190
- We're playing ping-pong.
- At 5:00 in the morning?

427
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,342
We're having fun,
we're playing ping-pong.

428
00:26:15,502 --> 00:26:17,327
We've got house
full of people sleeping.

429
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:18,729
All right, I'm sorry.

430
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,327
Hey, wait wait.

431
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,411
Since you're up, though,
you ose you could make us

432
00:26:23,571 --> 00:26:26,412
some of those egg sandwiches
with swiss cheese... Canadian bacon?

433
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,604
- Hey, Rig. Hey, Riggs.
- Yeah?

434
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:31,805
Check out who's back on the block?

435
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:34,842
Oh, see,

436
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:36,505
I mean, her only problem is,

437
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:38,841
there's just too many guys,
too little time.

438
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:42,408
Riggins, why is that you always have
to point the finger at everyone else?

439
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,861
Not everyone's just as easy as you are.

440
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,641
Maybe Tyra's over there
having a nice conversation,

441
00:26:47,903 --> 00:26:49,226
welcoming him to our school.

442
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:51,219
You don't know what
they're talking about.

443
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:53,757
I don't know if you know this,
but I'm a virgin.

444
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:57,651
So I don't know where you're getting
your info from but it's wrong.

445
00:26:57,913 --> 00:26:59,612
You got a date for the dance yet?

446
00:26:59,874 --> 00:27:02,940
'cause you know, I hear
Matt's granny ain't doing thing.

447
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:05,826
I heard your mom
was triple-booked.

448
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:12,747
My granny is a nice, elderly woman.
She can't defend herself.

449
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:15,357
Tyra, may I just have
a word with you real quick?

450
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:17,796
May I talk to you for just a minute?

451
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:20,141
May I have a word?
Who is this homo?

452
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,635
- Hey, don't.
- I need to talk to you about the dance.

453
00:27:22,897 --> 00:27:25,679
- Can we just... Can you please..
- Right now is not a good time.

454
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,139
I realize...

455
00:27:27,401 --> 00:27:30,184
- She doesn't wanna talk to you.
- ...that these asshats here

456
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:33,270
are distracting you.
You're just trying to get your lunch.

457
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:35,397
She said she didn't wanna talk to you.

458
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:37,066
Is your name Tyra?

459
00:27:37,328 --> 00:27:38,234
Geek squad.

460
00:27:38,496 --> 00:27:40,144
You shut up and you,
come with me.

461
00:27:40,304 --> 00:27:42,351
She'already got a date
for the dance, skippy.

462
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:44,657
But I'll get you a text
to let you know how it went.

463
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:47,238
I was very sad to hear
about that tornado,

464
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:49,888
It must have been horrible
when your double-wide blew away.

465
00:27:50,057 --> 00:27:53,249
Is it okay for the goats
and the chickens and everything okay?

466
00:27:53,511 --> 00:27:56,043
- What's your problem, dork?
- You want me to go slower,

467
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:59,767
Richard Simmons? Cause I wasn't sure
it was you that was the remedial one

468
00:27:59,964 --> 00:28:02,405
or was it you
I don't remember.4

469
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,130
This ain't right, Coach!
Everybody was fighting.

470
00:28:41,392 --> 00:28:43,096
- Not just us!
- I don't care.

471
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,217
I want y'all to set an example!

472
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:48,762
From what I understand, Landry Clark
started the whole damn thing.

473
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,243
Broke 12 chairs
and a $300 cream machine,

474
00:28:51,403 --> 00:28:53,225
which y'all are gonna pay for

475
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:56,186
by each one of you running one lap
at a penny a piece.

476
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,463
Eric!

477
00:28:58,623 --> 00:29:00,801
- We'll pay o...
- This about the fight,

478
00:29:01,229 --> 00:29:04,389
tell you what, told my boys
absolutely unacceptable!

479
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:06,744
Even if they were provoked.

480
00:29:07,585 --> 00:29:09,340
Hey, boys will be boys.

481
00:29:10,304 --> 00:29:12,870
Don't you think you're being
a little hardass, Coach?

482
00:29:13,591 --> 00:29:16,415
Tell you what,
you coach your game, I'll coach mine.

483
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:19,376
Let'go, gentlemen!
Let's pick'em up now!

484
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:25,700
Yeah, it's mama.

485
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:29,422
How was your day?

486
00:29:29,704 --> 00:29:31,565
Oh, it was ridiculus.

487
00:29:31,892 --> 00:29:34,224
These Laribee kids
are a pain in the ass.

488
00:29:35,346 --> 00:29:38,212
They had a brawl in the lunch room.

489
00:29:38,532 --> 00:29:40,060
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

490
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:42,608
- What's this?
- Oh, okay.

491
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,348
That is so awesome,
it makes one cup at a time,

492
00:29:46,707 --> 00:29:49,114
You're always leaving,
and leave the pot half full.

493
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:50,947
This way you've got gonna waste any.

494
00:29:51,107 --> 00:29:53,243
That is sweet of you Shelly.
I appreciate it.

495
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:55,639
Eric's kind of particular
about his coffee.

496
00:29:55,802 --> 00:29:59,176
I think he's gonna love it, honestly.
It makes hot chocolate, it makes tea.

497
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:01,421
But look, this is what I wanna show you.

498
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:03,545
- Who's that for?
- This is for Tim.

499
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:06,680
- For Tim Riggins?
- Don't you think it's perfect?

500
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:08,674
- Shelly.
- What?

501
00:30:08,979 --> 00:30:12,008
Don't you think it's completely
inappropriate? He is a teenage boy.

502
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,140
Tamy, it's a shirt.

503
00:30:14,587 --> 00:30:17,902
I realize it's a shirt. But are you
aware of the way you're behaving?

504
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:20,176
Walking around,
you're all flirty with him.

505
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:22,064
Oh, my God.
I've not been flirty!

506
00:30:22,402 --> 00:30:23,857
You are being flirty.

507
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:26,234
You're jealous
because he gets along with me

508
00:30:26,394 --> 00:30:28,067
better than he gets along with you?

509
00:30:28,332 --> 00:30:30,658
This has nothing to do
with me being jealous.

510
00:30:30,855 --> 00:30:33,504
That is absurd. Do you realize
what your life has come to?

511
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:36,328
- My life?
- Your ftasizing after a teenage boy.

512
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,599
Please, don't comment on my life
until you have your life, your family.

513
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:41,792
Don't you dare come into my house

514
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:44,684
and talk to me about my life
and my family.

515
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:47,697
You can comment on my life
but I can't comment on your life?

516
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:51,039
You come into my house
and talk to me about my house.

517
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:53,490
No, I don't think so.
I'm not being judgemental,

518
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,422
but frankly, I'm worried about you,

519
00:30:55,776 --> 00:30:58,267
I really do wonder why
you just refuse to grow up.

520
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:01,478
I can tell you what. Because then
I might end up just like you.

521
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,819
Is that right?

522
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:04,289
Then, why don't you continue

523
00:31:04,449 --> 00:31:06,695
to spend the rest of you life
behave like a teenager?

524
00:31:06,855 --> 00:31:08,611
I mean, it's no wonder
that you're single.

525
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:10,525
Oh, my God.

526
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,781
- Well?
- Yeah, no, great.

527
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:16,743
I'm just so amazed you're comfortable
leaving your 2 month old baby

528
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:19,171
with such an irresponsible little slut,

529
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:22,073
so, I'm a little confused
by that choice.

530
00:31:24,242 --> 00:31:27,078
I put a fresh bottle in the fridge.
I changed her diaper.

531
00:31:28,592 --> 00:31:30,924
I'm gonna go to my room
and I'm gonna read Tiger Beat.

532
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:33,158
And by the way,

533
00:31:34,744 --> 00:31:37,347
your baby is in the 70th percentile
for height and weight,

534
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:39,505
and your pediatrician says hello.

535
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,726
We don't know where I got 'em.

536
00:31:52,255 --> 00:31:55,030
Why...
Why is my nose smelling pee?

537
00:31:56,494 --> 00:31:58,203
Yo, check this out, man.
Somebody...

538
00:31:58,463 --> 00:32:00,828
There's pee in this locker.
That's where it's coming from.

539
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:02,193
Are you serious?

540
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,001
Smash, somebody done pissed
in his locker, man.

541
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:06,255
What?

542
00:32:06,972 --> 00:32:07,970
No, hell no.

543
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,510
Oh, no.
Hell no.

544
00:32:10,524 --> 00:32:12,717
We're gonna see how tough
these kids really are.

545
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:14,221
Get 'em, Rigg.

546
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:23,334
Who's the hero?

547
00:32:24,852 --> 00:32:26,595
A football team
is working out here, son.

548
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:28,905
Just go ahead and hit the showers.

549
00:32:31,504 --> 00:32:33,554
You heard me.
Go take a shower!

550
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:37,242
Sorry about that, dude.
Couldn't hold it.

551
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:38,868
It's funny.

552
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:41,287
You're gonna do something about it,
tough guy?

553
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:43,706
You need to go cool off.

554
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:48,770
I might just do it.

555
00:32:49,045 --> 00:32:50,797
Hey, no!
What are you doing?

556
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:54,092
Don't you push me!
Don't you ever lay your hands on me!

557
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,063
Listen to me.

558
00:32:57,828 --> 00:33:00,884
You ever, I mean,
ever touch one of my players again,

559
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:04,227
you'll never coach another football game,
you understand me?

560
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:08,398
And after that, I will kick your old,
tid ass six ways from Sunday, Donald.

561
00:33:16,231 --> 00:33:17,304
Shut up.

562
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:19,867
I want all my players
outside by the bleachers.

563
00:33:20,218 --> 00:33:22,245
Coach, take 'em out
then have a litte walk.

564
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:23,413
Right now!

565
00:33:23,673 --> 00:33:25,598
- Let's go!
- Get outside right now!

566
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:26,874
Get out, let's go!

567
00:33:30,606 --> 00:33:33,298
What are you looking at?
Get back to work!

568
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,969
Who else want a cup?

569
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:45,932
This thing is so cool.
Thanks, Aunt Shelly.

570
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:47,820
You're right,
it's a better coffee maker.

571
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,124
I thank you very much.

572
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:50,909
So glad you like it.

573
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:53,659
Seems like they really like the coffee.

574
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:57,404
You're in a good mood 'cause there's
no game tonight, isn't that right?

575
00:33:57,573 --> 00:33:58,990
- It's good coffee.
- Yeah.

576
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:01,545
- Morning.
- Morning, Tim.

577
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:03,158
Good morning.

578
00:34:03,345 --> 00:34:04,732
- Hi, Timothy.
- Shels.

579
00:34:05,006 --> 00:34:07,092
Hi. You know,
I'm gonna go to my room.

580
00:34:07,252 --> 00:34:09,292
I don't wanna do anything inappropriate.

581
00:34:10,404 --> 00:34:11,768
I'll just excuse myself.

582
00:34:11,928 --> 00:34:13,270
Let's talk about dinner.

583
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,767
Who wants to eat what
before the dance tonight?

584
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:17,564
I'm not going, so...

585
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:20,136
Me neither. I told you, remember?
I go hang out with Lois.

586
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,209
I'll have lasagna.

587
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:24,996
Well, no, if y'all aren't going,
forget it. We'll go out.

588
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:26,225
Ready for school?

589
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:28,561
Yeah, gimmie a minute.

590
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:30,271
Okay, yeah.
Bye, dad. Bye, mom.

591
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,566
- Sweetie, hold on, come here.
- Why can't we have lasagna?

592
00:34:36,364 --> 00:34:38,990
About yesterday,
I just wanna say...

593
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,615
I wanna say thank you...

594
00:34:42,103 --> 00:34:43,853
for helping me out there.

595
00:34:44,163 --> 00:34:45,008
So...

596
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:50,365
Yeah.

597
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,429
All right.

598
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,513
I'll see you at practice.

599
00:34:57,948 --> 00:34:58,948
All right.

600
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,484
There you go.

601
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,794
You know what?

602
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:08,494
- What?
- Relationships suck.

603
00:35:09,772 --> 00:35:12,237
- I'm just learning this.
- If I remember correctly,

604
00:35:12,397 --> 00:35:16,052
I believe you're the one that ended that
with Matt, not the other way around.

605
00:35:16,212 --> 00:35:18,765
It's complicated
and you don't get the full story.

606
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:27,537
What, are you still hung up on Tyra?

607
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:29,189
No.

608
00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:30,432
You ju...

609
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:34,377
You just gotta let it go, sometimes.
You just gotta let people...

610
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,491
be who he wanna be and just...

611
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,677
let 'em go make out with whoever
they wanna make out

612
00:35:40,837 --> 00:35:42,343
in front of whoever they feel like.

613
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:44,887
You don't just give up, though.

614
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,972
If you really care about something,
you don't just give up.

615
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:50,977
You do what you do whatever it takes.

616
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:59,515
Screw it, I'm not just gonna give up.

617
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:02,931
You can't just leave!
We were playin'.

618
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,418
- I know you.
- Yeah.

619
00:36:11,578 --> 00:36:13,958
- From?
- Riley, we're in english lit together.

620
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:17,086
You wanna play quarters?
I'm pretty good.

621
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:20,108
Where's your date at?

622
00:37:21,818 --> 00:37:25,071
Well, apparently,
he's in the bathroom puking.

623
00:37:25,764 --> 00:37:26,764
So...

624
00:37:32,074 --> 00:37:35,057
- I don't know what I was thinking.
- What were you thinking?

625
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,118
I just don't get it.

626
00:37:37,278 --> 00:37:39,877
Landry, will you sit down with me
for a second, please?

627
00:37:51,305 --> 00:37:52,723
You know how I feel about you.

628
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,518
No, I really don't.

629
00:37:55,778 --> 00:37:56,928
I like you...

630
00:37:57,492 --> 00:37:58,378
a lot.

631
00:38:01,132 --> 00:38:02,340
Actually, I...

632
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:08,017
I've never felt like this about anybody.

633
00:38:08,457 --> 00:38:10,607
You make me feel too much, Landry.

634
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:13,607
It freaks me out.

635
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,220
I don't know what that means.
What does that mean?

636
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,567
It means...

637
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:21,919
It means I'm sorry.

638
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:25,173
Look, all I need...

639
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,217
is just a little time
to think about things.

640
00:38:29,463 --> 00:38:30,511
Figure it out.

641
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:33,391
Does that make sense?

642
00:38:38,204 --> 00:38:39,687
No, it doesn't.

643
00:38:40,713 --> 00:38:42,273
It doesn't make sense at all.

644
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:43,783
You know, I'm...

645
00:38:44,418 --> 00:38:46,592
I'm really sorry about this too.

646
00:38:46,821 --> 00:38:49,989
The thing is that I know
that you're better than this.

647
00:38:50,574 --> 00:38:52,989
Better than the girl
that has to sit over here alone

648
00:38:53,149 --> 00:38:55,633
because her date is too stupid
to stay sober for one night.

649
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:59,190
I know that you're better than that.
The thing is that you don't.

650
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:03,299
I don't know what I have to do
to make you see that.

651
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:06,631
But I can't just keep waiting around
until you finally realize that I can't.

652
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,010
'Cause I've tried to show you,
but I don't know what else to do.

653
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:12,443
So...

654
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:14,947
So have a good night.

655
00:39:27,507 --> 00:39:30,154
The little God guy things.
With the... With the...

656
00:39:30,973 --> 00:39:34,575
With the yarn and you bring them home,
and your mom would be like,

657
00:39:34,978 --> 00:39:37,231
"Oh, my God!
It's so beautiful."

658
00:39:37,505 --> 00:39:39,038
And you'd be, like, on moonshoes.

659
00:39:39,634 --> 00:39:40,714
Hey, Jules.

660
00:39:41,257 --> 00:39:43,009
I think it's time we go.

661
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,253
I...
I don't wanna go.

662
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:46,921
You wanna?
I grab you a beer.

663
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,799
- Come here for a second.
- You're getting beers?

664
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,117
- Yeah, you want one?
- Can I get a beer?

665
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:55,753
- How you doing?
- Good.

666
00:39:55,913 --> 00:39:57,607
You good?
How's that going?

667
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:00,981
Good. I think I might be maybe
one beer away from getting laid.

668
00:40:01,141 --> 00:40:03,604
- No kidding? That's great.
- Yeah.

669
00:40:03,864 --> 00:40:05,314
Yeah, she is great.

670
00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:07,065
Hey...

671
00:40:08,795 --> 00:40:12,816
If you ever look at her,
even tonight, again...

672
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:17,159
at school, anytime for that matter,
I swear to God, I'll hang you.

673
00:40:18,638 --> 00:40:19,713
- Okay?
- Right on.

674
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:21,632
- Are we cool?
- Yeah, absolutely.

675
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:22,793
All right.

676
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:25,640
No, seriously.
That way.

677
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,420
Okay.
Later.

678
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:31,090
Hey.
Yeah, it's time.

679
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:33,592
Time for what?
Where's my beer?

680
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,801
Remember what I said
about being quiet.

681
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:40,281
Yeah, but she likes you.

682
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:42,678
She always talks about you
and I just told her...

683
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:47,078
I told her, I was like, you know what,
you should just tell him.

684
00:40:47,347 --> 00:40:50,430
It could be, like, 15 minutes.
You know what I'm sayin'?

685
00:40:50,703 --> 00:40:53,169
- I know what you're saying exactly.
- And she likes you.

686
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:54,964
She wants to be with you.

687
00:40:55,124 --> 00:40:56,572
- You know?
- That's awesome.

688
00:40:56,732 --> 00:40:58,582
I told her she shouldn't...

689
00:41:00,053 --> 00:41:01,329
The whole world's spinning.

690
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:02,739
I know what it is.

691
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,040
I've been there.

692
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,300
It's spinning!

693
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,510
Listen to me,
keep your eyes open, you'll be fine.

694
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,503
I'm gonna vomit on the bed.

695
00:41:09,763 --> 00:41:11,673
I'm gonna vomit on the floor.

696
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:16,088
Let's move you up so you can actually
pass out without falling off the bed.

697
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:19,466
Ready?
Three, two, one.

698
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,676
- Okay, you good?
- I'm good.

699
00:41:22,836 --> 00:41:24,935
It's time to let go.
What are you doing?

700
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,312
Hey, Jules.

701
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:29,743
Let go.

702
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:31,702
Coach...

703
00:41:31,862 --> 00:41:33,620
What the hell are you doing?

704
00:41:34,072 --> 00:41:37,531
- What the hell are you doing?
- It's not even close to what you think.

705
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:39,742
- Okay? Listen to me.
- Shut up.

706
00:41:40,658 --> 00:41:42,841
You shut up.
You shut your mouth right now.

707
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,579
- Coach, you have to understand...
- Shut your mouth.

708
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:47,708
Go get your stuff
and get out of this house now.

709
00:41:48,826 --> 00:41:51,629
Go get your stuff
and get out of this house right now.

710
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:53,339
Son, don't make me throw you out.

711
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,633
Go get your stuff
and get out of the house now.

712
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:00,413
Right now get your stuff
and get out of the door.

713
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:01,998
Go.
