1
00:00:01,121 --> 00:00:02,862
She's on the phone right now
with Matt Saracen?

2
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:04,830
It's becoming that thing
that we always knew

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,483
was gonna happen
with our little girl.

4
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:08,067
We kind of been going out.

5
00:00:08,126 --> 00:00:10,075
But we never
really made it official.

6
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:11,685
Will you be my girlfriend?

7
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,063
I am here to inform you

8
00:00:13,102 --> 00:00:14,499
that you have been invited

9
00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:16,221
to training camp
in Austin.

10
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:17,740
The quad rugby
national team

11
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,913
is having tryouts in Austin.

12
00:00:18,942 --> 00:00:20,142
And if I go
and I make the team,

13
00:00:20,174 --> 00:00:21,820
possibly be going to Beijing
later this year.

14
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:24,292
- Tyra?
- Your mom is the greatest.

15
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:26,341
She volunteered to help me
finish out tonight.

16
00:00:26,398 --> 00:00:27,450
What is your problem?

17
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:28,921
Your dad, Buddy Garrity.

18
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:30,880
His dirty hands all over my mom,
his employee.

19
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,431
Your Dad is down
in Corpus Christi.

20
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:33,543
He's working on
a driving range.

21
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:34,890
Do not believe a word
that that man says.

22
00:00:34,928 --> 00:00:36,170
And do not
get drunk with him.

23
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:37,233
I'm on the wagon now.

24
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:38,070
Sobered up.

25
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:39,442
Six weeks next Tuesday.

26
00:00:39,526 --> 00:00:40,161
Tim!

27
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:41,760
- What are you doing?
- Dad's here.

28
00:00:47,957 --> 00:00:49,612
How about another round,
sweetheart?

29
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,021
Let's go three, corner.

30
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,120
My cue is on fire!

31
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:55,962
Nice shot!

32
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:58,781
Oh Lord,
that was nice.

33
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:00,981
Yes!
Nice shot!

34
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:02,242
I don't know
what's gotten into him.

35
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:03,082
I really don't.

36
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:04,870
I'd say his game's
improved quite a bit

37
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,421
in the last half hour,
wouldn't you?

38
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:07,360
It's weird, huh?

39
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:08,341
Yeah, I'll say.

40
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:10,921
Thank you, darlin'.

41
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:14,561
Watch your back, sir.
Don't wanna hit you.

42
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:16,142
This is for all the money.

43
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:19,440
Who's the winners?
Who's the winners?

44
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:20,761
All the way home!

45
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:22,213
Oh, now you're up against it.

46
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:24,310
Hey, you wouldn't be hustlin'
us here now, would ya?

47
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:25,501
Hustlin' you?

48
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:26,112
Yeah.

49
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:28,012
Hustlin' you, beating you
with one hand

50
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:28,961
tied behind my back.

51
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:30,792
Either way, you still owe me
100 bucks.

52
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,862
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

53
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:36,290
Talking to a guy
that owes me 100 bucks.

54
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:38,532
The loser
who owes me 100 bucks.

55
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:39,731
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

56
00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:41,172
Then how is it
you come into this place

57
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,590
and that boy
can't hit a shot...

58
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,732
Boy, you just...

59
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:48,401
Who the hell threw that?

60
00:01:48,545 --> 00:01:49,361
No idea.

61
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:50,361
Did you throw that?

62
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:51,960
Me? No.

63
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:53,132
Hey!

64
00:01:53,217 --> 00:01:54,481
You wanna fight me?
Huh?

65
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:55,961
You wanna fight me?
Take me down?

66
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,301
Aren't you gonna
do anything about this?

67
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,551
My boy can handle himself.

68
00:01:58,598 --> 00:01:59,680
I'll take you outside.

69
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:00,973
There's gonna be
no fightin' here, Buck.

70
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:02,850
You lost.
Now pay up and leave.

71
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:04,223
100 bucks.

72
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:06,571
There's your money.

73
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:09,752
You wanna take me out,
you come back and you find me.

74
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:11,842
Get out.

75
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:15,011
Hablar.

76
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:16,630
Hablar.

77
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:18,990
Hablo, hablas, habla,
hablamos, hablan.

78
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:19,891
That works.

79
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:23,920
Matt?

80
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:26,270
- Matt?
- Yeah?

81
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:28,891
Did you eat
the last of that pudding?

82
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:30,581
What?

83
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:32,511
Now you know I like
a little pudding

84
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:34,372
at the end of the day
to settle my stomach.

85
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:35,572
- Hi, Julie.
- Hey.

86
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:37,762
Now hands off

87
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,590
my tapioca, Matthew.

88
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:40,683
Yes, ma'am.

89
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:51,183
So you wanna maybe
try and study again...

90
00:02:51,226 --> 00:02:52,401
I think we should have sex.

91
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:54,892
- ...morning?

92
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:57,573
Well, I think it's time,
don't you think?

93
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,260
Yeah, me too.
So, um...

94
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:02,901
Let's get on that.

95
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,373
Good night.

96
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:09,652
Hi, Matt!

97
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:13,242
H-hi, Mrs. Coach.

00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:21,000

98
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,590
Matt, this is a watershed moment here.

99
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:04,791
I mean, you're going
into an entirely new realm.

100
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:06,861
I got a--um, look...

101
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:08,450
I've got
just a little gift for you.

102
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:10,320
- I found this in my dad's glove compartment.
- Landry...

103
00:04:11,276 --> 00:04:12,290
I found it, I was--

104
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:14,123
Get that nasty, raggedy-ass
thing out of here.

105
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:16,292
Look, come on, come on.

106
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:17,193
Excuse me one second.

107
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,622
Now look, you got her
at first and inches.

108
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,562
But you still gotta
read the coverage,

109
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:23,421
okay?

110
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:25,582
Now, I ain't trying to encourage
sex out of wedlock.

111
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:27,652
Don't put it on
on Smash.

112
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:28,220
Okay.

113
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:29,091
But if you're gonna do it...

114
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:31,833
you're gonna need
to think about logistics.

115
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:33,110
You're gonna need a time,

116
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:34,840
you're gonna need a place.

117
00:04:35,778 --> 00:04:37,780
And you're gonna need
some fresh protection.

118
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:39,881
Yeah, he is right.

119
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:41,271
You got some work
to do, son.

120
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:45,172
All right, this is
6th street, Austin.

121
00:04:45,255 --> 00:04:46,470
Party central.

122
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,933
Eyeballs deep
in beautiful women.

123
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:50,113
I don't care about

124
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,463
being up to your
eyeballs in women.

125
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:53,773
I care about
getting to practice.

126
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:54,660
This is a big deal.

127
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:57,210
Hey!
How you doin', baby!

128
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,842
Whoo!
Hey darlin'!

129
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:01,241
Oh, my Lord.

130
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:03,323
- We're gonna hit that later.
- We're gonna be late, Herc.

131
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,442
- Relax!
- We're gonna be late--

132
00:05:04,457 --> 00:05:05,432
I told you--
We're gonna be late--

133
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:07,422
Yeah, I am mad at you.

134
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:08,930
I am very mad at you.

135
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:11,062
You wanna know why?
'Cause this is a big deal to me.

136
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:13,880
And to you, it seems like
you don't wanna pay attention.

137
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:14,871
You don't wanna...

138
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:17,070
- Herc, you--
- How you doin'?

139
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:19,240
I need to know everything
about you right now.

140
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:20,983
Your full name.
What's your favorite color.

141
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:23,001
Hi, uh, Jason Street.

142
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,670
Nice Job!
Let's go!

143
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:25,660
Is this your
first time here?

144
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,733
Actually, I don't really
have time for a conversation.

145
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:29,482
So if you could just
sign me in, that'd be great.

146
00:05:29,684 --> 00:05:30,830
It's not me asking.

147
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:32,643
It's a question
on the form.

148
00:05:34,686 --> 00:05:35,760
Jason Street.

149
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:37,730
There's your welcome packet.
And your room key.

150
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:39,100
There is your jersey.

151
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,411
Favorite number?

152
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:42,723
Have fun.

153
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:44,331
I'm already
having fun, Mo.

154
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:46,173
I'm gonna get me
some Mo later.

155
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:47,652
I'll be here
for some mo'.

156
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:48,391
All right.

157
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:51,562
Did you really
fall for that?

158
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,372
- Kind of.
- Push!

159
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:57,003
Where the hell
have you guys been?!

160
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:58,953
I don't wanna
hear any excuses.

161
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:00,502
What are you lookin' at?

162
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:01,522
Nothing, sir.

163
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:02,613
Quit lookin' around.
Get in the chair!

164
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:03,310
Yes, sir.

165
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:05,543
What are you guys
looking at? Let's go!

166
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:08,013
Let's play some rugby!
Let's go!

167
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:15,750
Yeah?

168
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:17,541
Hi, is Billy in?

169
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:19,462
Billy, some chick's here
to see you.

170
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:23,241
Sweetie, I'll be in
in a second.

171
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:25,670
What's up?

172
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:27,980
I'actually
here about Tim.

173
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:30,243
Well, he's uh...

174
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:31,620
He's drinking again.

175
00:06:31,987 --> 00:06:32,451
That's...

176
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:33,862
Deal or No Deal
ison, Billy!

177
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:34,410
Yeah.

178
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:36,072
Uh, that's right on schedule.

179
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:38,253
Yeah, well, Tim doesn't
see anything wrong with it.

180
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:40,003
And it just seemed like
he was doing so much better.

181
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:42,050
So I just thought
that maybe you could...

182
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:44,281
you can't help him, okay?

183
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:45,460
Okay.

184
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:48,212
I've done everything
I could for him.

185
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:49,461
He chose Walt
in this situation.

186
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:51,030
He's made his bed,
now he's gotta lie in it.

187
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:53,331
He's just gonna have
to live with the decision.

188
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:53,973
All right?

189
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:00,112
Eric, you're my friend,
right?

190
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,840
I can talk to you
about anything, right?

191
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:05,210
Yeah, well...

192
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,161
I'll just put it
point blank.

193
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:10,330
I strayed outside
my marriage.

194
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:12,123
I mean...

195
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:14,990
and the problem is,
now she thinks

196
00:07:14,998 --> 00:07:16,283
it's more than it is.

197
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:17,190
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
- Yep.

198
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,792
No, no, I'm saying uh-uh,

199
00:07:18,836 --> 00:07:20,762
I don't wanna know who it is and
I don't wanna know anything about it.

200
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,572
I mean, we had
a wonderful time.

201
00:07:23,928 --> 00:07:25,923
She's a wild cat,
you know what I mean?

202
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:28,163
But it's just--I can't...

203
00:07:28,276 --> 00:07:29,792
- I mean she--
- Hush down.

204
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:31,920
I may have said some things
in the heat of passion...

205
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:34,610
you know, I may have said
I was unhappy in my marriage

206
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:37,271
in some ways,
but you know how it is.

207
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:39,132
No, Buddy,
I don't know how it is.

208
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,352
Well, it's not
the only problem.

209
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:44,683
She also...

210
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:47,240
she works for me.

211
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:51,352
I know.
I know.

212
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:52,631
Hey.

213
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:54,350
Eric, hey,

214
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:55,703
I'm a weak man.

215
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:57,970
- You're a stupid man.
- No, I'm a sinner, you know?

216
00:07:58,015 --> 00:07:59,911
I'm just looking
for a little guidance here.

217
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,110
Just a little advice
is all I'm asking.

218
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:03,181
- You want some advice?
- Yeah, I do.

219
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:04,291
Number one...

220
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:07,130
you should tell this woman,

221
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:08,183
whoever the hell it is,

222
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:09,113
I don't wanna know...

223
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:10,880
that under no uncertain terms

224
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:11,710
that it's over.

225
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:12,822
Number two...

226
00:08:13,308 --> 00:08:15,313
you need to go home
and take care of your wife

227
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:17,163
and think about
those kids of yours.

228
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,943
That's all I got to say.

229
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,150
I'll let you
cover the bill.

230
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:23,291
Oh, I got it, I got it.

231
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:24,010
Thanks.

232
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,790
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

233
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:32,650
We got, um...

234
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:33,931
Endure...

235
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:36,020
Lasticon,

236
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:36,890
True Fit...

237
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:38,861
We can cancel out Mega,

238
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:39,680
I believe.

239
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:41,282
I think you should
think about Lasticon.

240
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:42,732
- Let's just--
- Hold on, wait.

241
00:08:43,185 --> 00:08:45,430
God, I mean, this is
an important decision here.

242
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:47,260
Matt, you gotta
look at everything.

243
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:48,283
Didn't you hear
what Smash said?

244
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:49,263
It's all in the details.

245
00:08:49,318 --> 00:08:50,923
None of this is gonna matter
if I die

246
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:51,901
of embarrassment first.

247
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:53,571
You're not gonna die.
Quit being a baby.

248
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,650
Can we just get something
that protects

249
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:57,273
everyone from everything.

250
00:08:57,936 --> 00:08:59,342
Like--yes, those.
Let's get those.

251
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,413
- Let's go, let's go.
- Okay, fine.

252
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,310
You sure you don't need
like a back-up or something

253
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:05,753
just in case those don't...

254
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:07,033
There's like 12 of them
in here.

255
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:08,181
I know, but...

256
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:24,533
- Hi.
- Hey.

257
00:09:26,795 --> 00:09:28,900
I saw Matt Saracen
buying condoms today.

258
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:34,132
Oh.

259
00:09:35,245 --> 00:09:36,543
You know anything
about that?

260
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,591
No.

261
00:09:40,016 --> 00:09:41,050
Really? Nothing?

262
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,702
Well, he was either
buying 'em for you

263
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,250
or he was buying 'em
for somebody else.

264
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:50,300
I think you better
come talk to me.

265
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:07,192
Okay.

266
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,100
Are you and Matt Saracen
having sex?

267
00:10:15,585 --> 00:10:16,201
No.

268
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:21,483
We're thinking about it.

269
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:27,170
You're thinking about it.

270
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:33,273
Are you thinking
about pregnancy?

271
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:34,810
Are you thinking about

272
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:36,820
sexually transmitted diseases?

273
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,133
Well, I mean, obviously.

274
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,613
That's why
he's buying condoms.

275
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,972
Oh, I see.
So you're just

276
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:42,043
buying condoms.

277
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:43,092
And then when
you buy condoms,

278
00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:45,483
that just makes you ready
to make love to somebody.

279
00:10:46,006 --> 00:10:47,070
- Making love?
- Don't do that.

280
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:48,903
Don't you smirk at me
right now.

281
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,691
I am very upset!

282
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:54,670
You are not allowed
to have sex!

283
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:56,542
You're 15 years old!

284
00:11:00,315 --> 00:11:01,800
I just--I don't see
what the big deal...

285
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:03,512
It's just one body part
going into another.

286
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:04,541
No, it's not.
No, it's not.

287
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:06,391
It's not just one body part
going into another body part.

288
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:08,720
And the fact that you think
that it's just

289
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:10,532
one body part
going into another body part

290
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:11,582
makes me real

291
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:13,131
clear on the fact

292
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:15,181
that you really
are not ready for this.

293
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:17,733
And I need you
to be able to hear that.

294
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:20,221
I need you to be able
to hear me say that to you.

295
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:23,862
I'm listening to you.

296
00:11:25,288 --> 00:11:26,842
Let me tell you
what the big deal is.

297
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,103
Let me tell you
what can happen.

298
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:29,922
What can happen
is that you can be hurt.

299
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:31,993
And you can be

300
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:34,262
degraded.

301
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,043
And you can become hard

302
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:37,320
and you can become cynical.

303
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,241
And I don't want that
to happen to you.

304
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:43,573
This is something
that's special.

305
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:46,611
It's something that's meant
for people who are in love.

306
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:50,211
Okay, I-I understand.

307
00:11:50,647 --> 00:11:51,773
And you can wait.

308
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:03,510
I want you to be able
to talk to me about it.

309
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:05,891
Okay.
I mean, we're talking, right?

310
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:43,080
Matt.

311
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:45,381
- Hey.
- Hey.

312
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:46,200
What's up?
What's going on?

313
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,111
So my mom saw you
buying condoms last night.

314
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:51,271
Are you ser--

315
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:53,813
Did she--
is she gonna tell your dad?

316
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:55,982
No, she said
she wasn't going to.

317
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:57,201
So then we're not
gonna do this.

318
00:12:57,228 --> 00:12:59,152
- We're not gonna have sex.
- No, we are gonna do this.

319
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,953
And I just don't understand
what the whole hysteria is

320
00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:02,230
over losing your virginity.

321
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:06,141
Uh, well, I got us
Bradley's lake house.

322
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:08,051
You told Bradley?

323
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,630
So Brad--
does the entire team know now?

324
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,630
No, just--
just Bradley.

325
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:14,420
And Bradley's Bradley,
so Bradley won't say...

326
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:15,240
Bradley's good.

327
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:16,882
You don't need to worry.

328
00:13:17,517 --> 00:13:18,140
He won't say anything.

329
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:20,440
- Okay.
- Okay.

330
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:21,930
All right, so here's
the thing, Matty-boy,

331
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:23,490
180 seconds.

332
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:25,093
Anything else is failure.

333
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:27,343
180.
I can do 180.

334
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:28,723
I can do that.

335
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:30,850
Hey, look, man, you gotta
use your camera phone.

336
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:31,933
I don't even
have a phone.

337
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:33,802
You don't--
I'll let you use mine.

338
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:34,960
But you gotta
have something...

339
00:13:35,008 --> 00:13:37,580
All right, 7, don't let those rookies
tell you what's going on.

340
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,501
You remember the first time
you drove a car?

341
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:41,891
Yeah, I crashed
my grandma's car

342
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,430
and now Landry
drives me around.

343
00:13:45,147 --> 00:13:46,110
Good look to you, 7.

344
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,462
Yeah, baby!
Dig! Dig!

345
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:50,723
That's my boy!

346
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:55,012
Hey, Riggs,
that's real cute.

347
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:56,293
You got your pop
cheering you on.

348
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:57,443
Mr. Riggins,
can I help you?

349
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,132
Hey, Coach.

350
00:13:58,216 --> 00:13:59,510
First team over the ball!

351
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:01,033
Why don't you give him
more carriage?

352
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:02,431
He's as good
as that Smash kid.

353
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:05,053
I tell you what,
we're right in the middle

354
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:05,820
of practice right now--

355
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:07,450
if you'd like, you can stand
over there on the sidelines...

356
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:09,542
I'm serious, why don't you
just give him more carriage?

357
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:10,180
That's all.

358
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:11,540
I'm thinking maybe we can
talk about this

359
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:12,502
at more appropriate time.
I'm in the middle

360
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:13,372
of practice right now.

361
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,770
You're more than welcome
to stand on the sidelines.

362
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:16,373
Hey, Coach, Coach.

363
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:22,530
You're really king of
this castle, aren't you, huh?

364
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:26,362
You think you're
better than me, is that it?

365
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,210
Over on the sidelines'll
be fine.

366
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,261
All right, let's go!

367
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:37,750
Get 'em, son!

368
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:45,580
- Coach.
- Yeah?

369
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:49,653
Uh, you know that camera
that we got from Boosters?

370
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:51,511
- Yeah.
- It's missing.

371
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:54,181
What do you mean
it's missing?

372
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:55,270
Can't find it.

373
00:14:57,378 --> 00:14:59,110
It's a $3,000 camera.
You better find it.

374
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:01,143
It's just that...

375
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,933
it's great to feel like a part
of a team again, you know?

376
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:05,161
I've got
the least experience,

377
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,081
but I'm pretty sure I'm a better
athlete than two of'em.

378
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:09,440
And that just
leaves this one guy.

379
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:10,892
- Hello.
- Ta da!

380
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:12,033
What?

381
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:14,802
You know, I think
I can take him, you know?

382
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:17,013
Babe?

383
00:15:18,365 --> 00:15:19,440
Lyla?
Am I boring you?

384
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:20,411
Are you with me?

385
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:21,763
No, I just...

386
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,620
my dad just walked in

387
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:25,243
and started
making out with my mom.

388
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:26,691
What the hell you doing?
You on a phone?

389
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:28,060
You're at a party!

390
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:29,111
Are you at a party?

391
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:30,370
No, no party.

392
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:31,462
No, it's a par-tay.

393
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:32,372
It's not a party.

394
00:15:34,327 --> 00:15:36,221
I thought it was
gonna be all work stuff.

395
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,362
Well--it is.

396
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:39,131
It's just a couple
of the boys, baby.

397
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:40,381
It's no big deal, okay?

398
00:15:41,368 --> 00:15:43,180
Buddy, you're crazy.

399
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:44,022
You are beautiful.

400
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:51,781
Could you, uh--I spilled
a little.

401
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:52,910
Will you get me
a paper towel out

402
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:54,752
from underneath that sink?
Right over there.

403
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,212
What are you doing?

404
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,140
Oh, I...

405
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:17,610
Hey.

406
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:18,911
I'm just...

407
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:22,922
I was designated
to pick the next CD.

408
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,613
And we're kind
of out of options.

409
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:25,992
- Well, what do you got?
- God, you know...

410
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:28,161
I don't even recognize
half of these.

411
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:29,660
What's right there?
That one you just touched?

412
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,720
- I don't know.
- That's a classic.

413
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:34,611
Gotta go with that.

414
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,181
Loretta Lynn.

415
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:37,711
Nice.

416
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:40,412
So,

417
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,921
look, I just wanna say
I'm sorry about yesterday.

418
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:43,881
I didn't mean to come off...

419
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:46,002
Oh, no no. Me.

420
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:47,810
I...I'm sorry.

421
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:49,641
I was such a bitch.
It was...

422
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:51,832
a long day.

423
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:53,453
I'm sure it was.

424
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:56,053
I'm Jason Street.

425
00:16:57,285 --> 00:16:59,781
Uh, Suzy Quinnlen.

426
00:17:00,638 --> 00:17:01,450
Nice to meet you.

427
00:17:02,907 --> 00:17:05,482
So, uh...
so do you work for the team?

428
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:06,760
Oh, no, that was,

429
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:07,842
you know,
just a day job.

430
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:09,902
I'm trying to get my business
off the ground.

431
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,763
And you know,
every little bit helps.

432
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,392
What's your--
what's your business?

433
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:15,753
Ink.
I'm a tattoo artist.

434
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:16,593
Seriously?

435
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:18,433
Seriously.

436
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:20,041
That's awesome.
Are these yours?

437
00:17:22,857 --> 00:17:24,050
All right,
there's four of 'em.

438
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,143
- Thanks, man.
- Hey, Coach.

439
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,111
Yeah.

440
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:27,923
We got a problem.

441
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:29,792
It's about the camera.

442
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:32,430
What about the camera?

443
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:34,481
Uh, one of the assistant
coaches saw

444
00:17:34,606 --> 00:17:35,491
Walt Riggins

445
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,001
going in the AV room

446
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:38,361
right before the camera
went missing.

447
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:41,611
Which coach?

448
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:43,331
Crowley.

449
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,771
Saw Tim Riggins' dad
come out of the AV room.

450
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:47,283
Yep.

451
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:48,602
The camera was there.

452
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:50,811
He goes in the room,
he comes out, it's gone.

453
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,281
What do you want me
to do?

454
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:00,150
Don't do anything.
I'll take care of it.

455
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:02,690
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

456
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:21,302
How you doing?

457
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:22,570
Fine, how are you?

458
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:24,141
Good, good.
Sorry to bother you at home.

459
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:25,171
It's not a bother.

460
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:26,353
What can I do for you?

461
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:27,500
Well, uh...

462
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:32,321
We're missing a camera
from the AV department.

463
00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:39,141
Are you going door to door
and asking all the parents about this?

464
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:40,420
No, I'm not.

465
00:18:46,538 --> 00:18:47,961
Well, I don't know--

466
00:18:48,146 --> 00:18:49,590
Well, I'll tell ya,
we had a coach

467
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:51,453
over at the school

468
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:53,150
and he saw you walk out
of the, uh,

469
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:54,322
the AV room.

470
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:55,092
So...

471
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:57,712
He said he doesn't know
where the camera is, Coach.

472
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:00,253
What else do you need?

473
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:07,733
All right,
I'm sorry to bother you.

474
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:08,821
Thank you.

475
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:10,391
Thank you for your time.

476
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:12,061
- Hey, Coach!
- Yeah?

477
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:14,953
You go to Bradley's place
and ask his dad

478
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:17,080
- if he stole the camera?
- No, I didn't do that.

479
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:20,320
I'm just curious why
you'd come to mine then.

480
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:26,342
I didn't know
you were there, I'm sorry.

481
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:28,963
Granted, he's made
some mistakes, Coach,

482
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:30,511
but that's
my father in there.

483
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:34,400
You're right, I apologize.
I'll see you at practice.

484
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:45,003
Angela, please.

485
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:46,573
Earl Stackhouse,
he's my buddy.

486
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:47,901
He needs
a front office girl.

487
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:49,313
I told him
how great you were.

488
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:51,422
I'm sorry.
I mean, I know what I said,

489
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:52,790
but I mean,
in the heat of passion...

490
00:19:53,335 --> 00:19:55,381
Here's hundreds.
Here's $600, $700.

491
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:56,991
Just walking around money,
okay?

492
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,201
Can we just
make this easy?

493
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:02,283
I'm sorry.

494
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:05,061
You're gonna be all right.

495
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:12,181
So what was it like,
your first time?

496
00:20:13,785 --> 00:20:15,120
You ever
watch the nature channel?

497
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:18,692
I'm... I'm really--
I'm just kidding.

498
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:20,202
- Okay?
- Oh, okay.

499
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:25,753
You don't have to do this.

500
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:27,882
You know that, right?

501
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:30,692
Yeah, I know that.
I just--I want to.

502
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:31,881
Because there will always

503
00:20:31,906 --> 00:20:32,901
be a steady stream

504
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:34,920
of horny football players
in Dillon, I can guarantee.

505
00:20:37,048 --> 00:20:37,771
No,

506
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:39,160
I mean...

507
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,871
Matt's different
and I really like him.

508
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:42,262
And he likes me.

509
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,312
And it's just
the perfect opportunity

510
00:20:44,355 --> 00:20:45,910
for me to control
the whole experience.

511
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:46,552
You know...

512
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:48,432
Get the information
and gather the data.

513
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:50,531
Wow,

514
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:52,731
that sounds real hot.

515
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:55,382
For Matt.

516
00:20:56,278 --> 00:20:58,101
Throw the guy a bone while
you're gathering your data.

517
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:03,993
As soon as if left my hands
I knew it was bad.

518
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:06,292
I saw him running,

519
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:08,120
and I was the only one
that had a clean shot at him.

520
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:10,390
And the only thing
going through my head

521
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:11,412
was that I just wanted
to kill him.

522
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:13,250
Just wanted
to obliterate him.

523
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:15,402
I put my head down

524
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:16,322
and I went...

525
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,802
right into him.

526
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:22,672
I guess the next thing was...

527
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:26,082
I came to
a couple minutes later,

528
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:28,890
and my parents
were just standing over me.

529
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:31,792
And my dad
was just holding my mom.

530
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,413
She was screaming

531
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:34,871
and he was crying.

532
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:36,522
First time I'd ever
seen my dad cry.

533
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:38,413
And he just kept on saying,

534
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:39,423
"Get up, son.
Get up.

535
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:40,971
Get up, son."

536
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:41,732
And

537
00:21:43,356 --> 00:21:44,091
I wasn't.

538
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:44,840
I couldn't.

539
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:46,090
Couldn't do it.

540
00:21:48,396 --> 00:21:49,183
I think if--

541
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,993
if it was me,
I would spend my whole life

542
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:53,913
wondering why.

543
00:21:58,127 --> 00:21:59,142
Yeah, there's--

544
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:00,662
there's a lot of that.

545
00:22:01,228 --> 00:22:02,222
There's a lot of that.

546
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:04,630
You just get angry,

547
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:05,331
you know?

548
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:06,111
And

549
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:09,302
you start wondering,
you know,

550
00:22:09,347 --> 00:22:10,663
"God, did you do this
to me?"

551
00:22:10,698 --> 00:22:11,842
You know, was it fate?

552
00:22:12,628 --> 00:22:14,553
Was it just some dumb accident?
Was it my fault?

553
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:17,790
And I prayed and prayed
and prayed,

554
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:19,341
and the only answer
I ever got was that...

555
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:21,770
I couldn't walk.

556
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:23,452
I can't walk.

557
00:22:24,157 --> 00:22:24,842
So...

558
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,271
I'm just ready
to get rid of that, you know?

559
00:22:28,436 --> 00:22:29,932
Get rid of that anger,
you know, and just--

560
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:31,591
just have some peace.

561
00:22:32,827 --> 00:22:34,641
Hey, after-school special!

562
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:38,532
Let me show you something!

563
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:40,673
This is the best jukebox
in town.

564
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:41,331
Casino!

565
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:42,421
You got that right.

566
00:22:43,106 --> 00:22:44,222
How about that?

567
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:46,531
Let's go,
after-school special.

568
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:47,832
Dance party.

569
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,291
Dance party.

570
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:53,652
You wanna get out of here?

571
00:22:54,028 --> 00:22:54,630
Yeah.

572
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:00,332
What's this one?

573
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:03,300
Oh, that's the Chinese symbol
for "wealth."

574
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:06,172
It's also the Chinese symbol
for "douche."

575
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,032
Do they have a Chinese symbol
for cripple?

576
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:10,522
No Chinese symbols,

577
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:12,370
no barbed wire, and

578
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:14,110
no naked ladies.

579
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:16,222
Just hold on there,
shooter,

580
00:23:16,238 --> 00:23:17,422
I'm looking for something,

581
00:23:17,468 --> 00:23:18,583
I just can't find it.

582
00:23:18,758 --> 00:23:19,663
Is this your station?

583
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:21,403
Yeah, right there.

584
00:23:21,955 --> 00:23:23,081
What's, uh...
what's this one?

585
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:24,842
Which one?

586
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:27,652
The red, yellow, and blue...

587
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:29,850
Oh, that was the wallpaper

588
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:31,843
in the hallway
at my grandma's house.

589
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:34,422
- Y'all were close?
- No!

590
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,993
She was a bitch on wheels

591
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:37,712
and everyone was glad
when she died.

592
00:23:39,246 --> 00:23:40,920
- Nice.
- I think the wallpaper was pretty.

593
00:23:41,577 --> 00:23:43,983
Oh, here it is.

594
00:23:44,928 --> 00:23:45,440
Found it.

595
00:23:47,146 --> 00:23:47,890
It's Sanskrit.

596
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:49,533
This top one.

597
00:23:52,337 --> 00:23:53,222
It says "peace."

598
00:23:57,676 --> 00:23:58,361
It's perfect.

599
00:24:09,457 --> 00:24:10,871
How you feelin', buddy?

600
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:13,081
Want me to cook you up
an omelet?

601
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:14,193
No, I'm good, Dad.

602
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:17,070
Gonna fix my headlight.

603
00:24:44,247 --> 00:24:46,152
I was gonna take that back,
I swear.

604
00:24:51,686 --> 00:24:53,181
I defended you, Dad.

605
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:54,912
- Timmy, this is no big deal.
- No, it is.

606
00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:57,222
And you know that.

607
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:00,500
I want you to leave.

608
00:25:05,188 --> 00:25:05,932
Get out.

609
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,052
Okay, you see
how easy this is, son.

610
00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:20,071
Just watch this.

611
00:25:50,578 --> 00:25:51,590
Nu-uh.

612
00:26:30,835 --> 00:26:32,031
- Hey!
- Hey.

613
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:33,962
Did Tyra drive you?

614
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,612
Uh, yeah, okay,

615
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,030
so my parents
think I'm at Lois'

616
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:38,123
and I need to be home
by 11:00.

617
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,130
So we should get
right down to the sex then.

618
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:41,750
Right?

619
00:26:43,316 --> 00:26:43,891
Good.

620
00:26:50,548 --> 00:26:53,153
Where in the bathroom
is the aspirin?

621
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:55,643
Look-- look in the--
underneath the sink.

622
00:26:56,435 --> 00:26:57,753
Poured you some wine.

623
00:26:58,196 --> 00:26:59,381
That might help.

624
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:05,371
Hey,

625
00:27:05,945 --> 00:27:08,100
were you planning something
special for tonight?

626
00:27:08,638 --> 00:27:10,571
Yes, I'm making you
a beautiful dinner.

627
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:12,363
Just poured you
a glass of wine.

628
00:27:12,786 --> 00:27:14,072
And if you get rid
of that headache,

629
00:27:14,095 --> 00:27:15,230
you may get lucky, darlin'.

630
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:16,352
What's this?

631
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:18,513
These yours?

632
00:27:18,556 --> 00:27:18,973
No.

633
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:19,990
Well, they're sure as hell
not mine,

634
00:27:20,027 --> 00:27:22,132
so what would our 15-year-old
daughter be doing with these?

635
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:23,622
Yeah.

636
00:27:25,368 --> 00:27:27,413
I think I need to talk to you
for a second, hon.

637
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:30,270
I...

638
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:32,991
I saw Matt Saracen
buying condoms

639
00:27:33,037 --> 00:27:34,101
earlier this week.

640
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:42,601
I'm sorry,
say that again.

641
00:27:43,257 --> 00:27:44,112
You heard what I said.

642
00:27:44,147 --> 00:27:45,360
Oh, I'd love to hear you
say that again.

643
00:27:45,406 --> 00:27:46,213
No, I'm not saying it.

644
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,120
And you were gonna
tell me this when?

645
00:27:47,156 --> 00:27:48,360
I talked to Julie
about it.

646
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,970
- Oh, you did?
- Well, yeah, I did.

647
00:27:50,246 --> 00:27:52,072
And did you also tell her
that if he even

648
00:27:53,165 --> 00:27:54,730
touches a hair on her head

649
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:56,882
that she's gonna be sent
to a nunnery in Rome,

650
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:58,780
and I'm gonna rip his head off
right afterwards.

651
00:27:58,815 --> 00:28:00,760
No, but what I told her
is she's too young

652
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,401
and she's not ready.
And then I tried to make

653
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:03,873
the best case that I could

654
00:28:04,437 --> 00:28:05,313
- against it.
- Oh, that's good.

655
00:28:05,368 --> 00:28:07,670
It might even help if we just
get her her own apartment.

656
00:28:07,777 --> 00:28:09,131
'Cause that's
pretty darn stern.

657
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,333
The reason that I didn't
consult with you

658
00:28:10,365 --> 00:28:11,491
and that I didn't
talk to you about it

659
00:28:11,537 --> 00:28:12,820
is because I felt
that you might

660
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:14,191
start to freak out.

661
00:28:14,307 --> 00:28:15,331
Which is I think
what you're doing right now.

662
00:28:15,337 --> 00:28:16,281
Where is she right now?

663
00:28:16,317 --> 00:28:17,953
She's at Lois' now, studying.

664
00:28:17,976 --> 00:28:18,812
Wait a second.

665
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,121
Hey, how you doing?

666
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:22,593
This is Coach Taylor.

667
00:28:22,957 --> 00:28:24,030
Uh, sir--

668
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:28,622
Yeah.
Hey, this is Coach Taylor.

669
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:30,203
I was just wondering
if my daughter's over there.

670
00:28:31,148 --> 00:28:31,763
Yes, sir.

671
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:35,971
Do you know if she was planning
on coming over there?

672
00:28:37,497 --> 00:28:38,643
No, everything's fine.

673
00:28:39,365 --> 00:28:40,063
Okay, thank you.

674
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,642
Why don't you find out
where our daughter is?

675
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:56,553
Hey.

676
00:28:56,705 --> 00:28:57,653
What are you doing
back here?

677
00:28:57,705 --> 00:28:58,772
You're not supposed to be
in the kitchen.

678
00:29:02,016 --> 00:29:02,853
Can you take a break?

679
00:29:03,638 --> 00:29:04,451
No, no.

680
00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:05,531
It's the dinner rush.

681
00:29:05,555 --> 00:29:07,541
And, you know, my manager's
breathing down my back.

682
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:09,912
I got a table full of
crazy, middle-aged women.

683
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:11,593
No, I can't take a break.
I'm sorry.

684
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:15,302
What?

685
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:18,902
Forget it.

686
00:29:20,357 --> 00:29:21,053
Tim!

687
00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:30,411
What?

688
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:32,972
The deer's staring at me.

689
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:34,602
The deer's...

690
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,350
Well, just, uh...

691
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:38,381
don't look at it.

692
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,160
I just--I feel like
it's judging me.

693
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:44,741
Can--can you cover it up
or something?

694
00:29:45,385 --> 00:29:46,080
Yeah.

695
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,071
All riht.

696
00:29:55,347 --> 00:29:57,732
Good, see?
He's sleeping.

697
00:29:58,636 --> 00:30:00,791
See, it's hard not to look at you
'cause you're so good-looking.

698
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:02,072
Damn?

699
00:30:09,348 --> 00:30:11,082
- Is it really hot in here?
- Um,

700
00:30:11,658 --> 00:30:13,472
yeah, I guess. Do you want me
to open a window?

701
00:30:14,357 --> 00:30:16,413
Yeah, that'd be really great.

702
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:17,432
Yeah, okay.

703
00:30:23,627 --> 00:30:24,362
Good.

704
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:25,152
Now it's cool.

705
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,372
Does it just
smell like wet dog?

706
00:30:40,897 --> 00:30:41,662
You know what?

707
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:45,561
Let's not do this.

708
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:47,802
N-no, no, no.

709
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:49,103
No, no, no.
I told you, I really wanted to.

710
00:30:49,156 --> 00:30:51,083
No, no, no, no, no,
you really don't.

711
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,433
And that's okay.
'Cause

712
00:30:53,246 --> 00:30:54,270
we don't have to.

713
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,002
We--we don't?

714
00:30:59,406 --> 00:31:00,110
No.

715
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,700
We can just hang out.

716
00:31:03,206 --> 00:31:04,543
Or eat.
Or I don't know, whatever.

717
00:31:07,257 --> 00:31:07,870
Really?

718
00:31:08,557 --> 00:31:09,273
Yeah.

719
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:12,222
But don't touch me right now.
That's--

720
00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:14,211
just give me
a minute, please.

721
00:31:14,308 --> 00:31:15,582
Oh, alright.

722
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:17,271
Yeah.
Yeah.

723
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:30,522
What time is it?

724
00:31:44,938 --> 00:31:46,503
You know, you and I
have the exact

725
00:31:46,548 --> 00:31:48,960
same amount of experience
being parents.

726
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:53,700
We've been doing this job

727
00:31:54,057 --> 00:31:56,093
the same number of years

728
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:58,223
and months and days
as each other.

729
00:31:58,517 --> 00:31:59,561
And the truth of it is
that we just don't

730
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:00,723
have any control.

731
00:32:01,438 --> 00:32:03,253
You know, for the most part
we're just winging it.

732
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,330
And, you know,
I don't know what to do.

733
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,033
I don't know what to do
in this situation.

734
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:12,810
But I'll tell you what,

735
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,231
the most important thing
to me...

736
00:32:14,996 --> 00:32:17,622
is that my daughter be able
to talk to me.

737
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:21,462
A girl is entitled

738
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,481
to that with her mother.

739
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,661
My mother used to tell me
that I was gonna hell

740
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:29,643
if a guy ever even touched me.
And you know that didn't work.

741
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,660
I'm sure as hell not gonna
do that to Julie.

742
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:45,533
And we raised a smart,

743
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:47,091
responsible...

744
00:32:48,256 --> 00:32:49,592
moral girl.

745
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:53,830
And I have faith in us.

746
00:32:56,588 --> 00:32:57,942
And I have faith in her.

747
00:33:00,996 --> 00:33:02,630
Now we just gotta
let her go.

748
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:19,381
I'm sorry
if I hurt you.

749
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,610
One...two...three.

750
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:35,313
Hup, see...
Wait, no, hey...

751
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:38,202
No, you're cheating.

752
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:40,242
I can't win
if I don't cheat.

753
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:42,932
Oh, those are very good 
ethics right there. That's great.

754
00:33:43,218 --> 00:33:44,232
Oh, wait.

755
00:33:45,366 --> 00:33:47,001
You have the ugliest feet

756
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:48,221
I have ever seen.

757
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:50,410
Oh, shut up!
I do not.

758
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:51,902
Because, look,
your second toe

759
00:33:51,957 --> 00:33:53,601
is all bigger
than your first toe.

760
00:33:53,678 --> 00:33:55,112
It's a sign of royalty.

761
00:33:55,217 --> 00:33:56,551
Oh, yeah--
what are you, like,

762
00:33:56,607 --> 00:33:58,111
the royal duchess of Dillon
or something?

763
00:33:58,216 --> 00:33:59,131
Okay, look who's talking,

764
00:33:59,177 --> 00:34:01,421
Mr. I-have-dirt
all-over- my-feet.

765
00:34:01,636 --> 00:34:02,651
Well, I mean...

766
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:04,880
Oh, my God. We were gonna
have sex tonight

767
00:34:04,937 --> 00:34:06,641
and didn't even
clean the bottoms of your feet?

768
00:34:06,656 --> 00:34:09,581
- I was gonna keep my socks on.
- Ew!

769
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:11,631
Whatever.
Ready, let's go.

770
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:12,972
One more time.

771
00:34:13,196 --> 00:34:14,032
Okay.

772
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:14,923
- Ready?
- All right.

773
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,911
One...two...three.

774
00:34:48,536 --> 00:34:49,292
Hey, Buck.

775
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:50,250
It's amateur hour here.

776
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:52,060
It's that punk kid
from the other night.

777
00:35:00,425 --> 00:35:01,170
Yeah.

778
00:35:02,097 --> 00:35:04,413
Come on, fellas.
Let's have some fun.

779
00:35:07,615 --> 00:35:08,900
Yeah!

780
00:35:10,747 --> 00:35:11,762
He fire you?

781
00:35:11,828 --> 00:35:12,542
Thank you.

782
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:14,161
Mr. Garrity fired you?
Why?

783
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:15,783
I really don't
want all these questions...

784
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:17,171
- Did something happen?
- Everything.

785
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:19,223
I don't wanna
talk about it right now.

786
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:23,043
Hello?

787
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:24,750
Hey, Tyra.
Teresa.

788
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:27,863
Your boy Tim's here
fixing to get his ass kicked.

789
00:35:32,178 --> 00:35:33,301
Okay, I gotta go.

790
00:35:33,606 --> 00:35:35,202
I'll be back.
We're gonna finish this later.

791
00:35:35,438 --> 00:35:37,133
Come on, boy!
What's it gonna be, huh?

792
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:38,693
- What do you got for me?
- Give him hell, Buck!

793
00:35:39,815 --> 00:35:41,723
Boy wants to do
professional wrestling!

794
00:36:07,447 --> 00:36:08,592
Come on, man.

795
00:36:08,905 --> 00:36:09,972
What's the matter?

796
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,310
Your daddy ain't here
to help you out, huh?

797
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,172
Come on,
 you need a hand?

798
00:36:28,106 --> 00:36:29,483
Get the hell
off him, man!

799
00:36:29,718 --> 00:36:30,650
Get the hell off him!

800
00:36:30,698 --> 00:36:32,883
- What are you doing?
- He was the one that kept it going!

801
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:34,650
He's just a kid, man!

802
00:36:34,746 --> 00:36:35,572
He's a kid.

803
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:38,492
He's just a kid.

804
00:36:48,097 --> 00:36:49,212
Where's that beer?

805
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:02,393
Hey, uh...Jules.

806
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:04,691
- Uh-huh.
- It's...

807
00:37:05,716 --> 00:37:06,472
kind of...

808
00:37:07,465 --> 00:37:08,821
It's kind of...

809
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:11,341
Oh, my God.

810
00:37:11,837 --> 00:37:13,032
Oh, my God.
We are so dead.

811
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:15,022
Um...

812
00:37:16,305 --> 00:37:17,512
Kill the lights.

813
00:37:23,088 --> 00:37:24,652
Do you want me to walk you
to the door or something?

814
00:37:24,717 --> 00:37:27,522
Are you kidding me? My dad's 
gonna kill you if he sees you.

815
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:29,272
Where are my keys?

816
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:30,600
Julie, I love you.

817
00:37:35,745 --> 00:37:36,943
Uh...what?

818
00:37:38,017 --> 00:37:38,861
I love you.

819
00:37:43,398 --> 00:37:44,633
Um...uh, me too.

820
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:48,752
I love you too.

821
00:37:56,898 --> 00:37:58,610
I'll...I'll call you later.

822
00:37:58,955 --> 00:38:00,781
Okay.
Bye.

823
00:38:33,888 --> 00:38:35,610
- Uh...
- Are you all right?

824
00:38:36,056 --> 00:38:36,931
Are you all right?

825
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:38,093
Uh, yeah.

826
00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:39,133
I'm fine.

827
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:41,631
I'm sorry.

828
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:43,442
And I know I'm late.
And I know I should have called

829
00:38:43,515 --> 00:38:45,130
because that's the whole reason 
you guys bought me this cell phone

830
00:38:45,165 --> 00:38:46,421
and I'm probably grounded
for the rest of my life,

831
00:38:46,486 --> 00:38:47,301
but I was with Matt.

832
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:48,702
And then
 we fell asleep and...

833
00:38:49,606 --> 00:38:52,510
And--no, no, no, no.
Nothing like that happened.

834
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:53,653
Not what you're thinking
happened.

835
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:55,372
Because that didn't happen
and I swear to you guys

836
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,240
that nothing happened.

837
00:39:02,576 --> 00:39:03,612
Good night.

838
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:14,661
And, uh, yeah.

839
00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:16,583
Uh, but, uh...

840
00:39:17,947 --> 00:39:19,031
thanks for the talk.

841
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:26,890
Good night.

842
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,762
Seeing the cross
 of sacrifice

843
00:39:49,835 --> 00:39:51,481
and the empty tomb.

844
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:55,712
We rejoice in the awesome
love of our Lord Jesus.

845
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,472
And we take comfort
in the eternal forgiveness

846
00:39:59,596 --> 00:40:01,232
that God gives to all

847
00:40:01,258 --> 00:40:04,093
who believe in Jesus
 and walk with him.

848
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,591
Let us go in peace

849
00:40:06,735 --> 00:40:08,083
and serve the Lord.

850
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:10,862
- Amen.
- Amen.

851
00:40:12,098 --> 00:40:14,352
So I was thinking, you know,
when we're at the, uh,

852
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:17,230
the, uh, store...
we could get a newspaper,

853
00:40:17,256 --> 00:40:18,671
look through the want ads.

854
00:40:19,388 --> 00:40:21,442
Or, you know, we could
go see a movie.

855
00:40:21,677 --> 00:40:22,950
That might, you know,

856
00:40:23,226 --> 00:40:24,401
make you feel a little better.

857
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,621
Where are we going?

858
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,263
Mother, what are we
doing here?

859
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:30,801
Mom...

860
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,670
Just stay in the car.

861
00:40:33,356 --> 00:40:35,852
- What...
- Stay in the car, I said!

862
00:40:38,446 --> 00:40:39,282
What are you...

863
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:40,870
Mama...

864
00:40:42,885 --> 00:40:43,740
Mother.

865
00:40:44,357 --> 00:40:45,093
Mother.

866
00:40:46,145 --> 00:40:47,061
Hey, Buddy!

867
00:40:48,226 --> 00:40:49,291
Oh, God.

868
00:40:50,035 --> 00:40:51,091
You lyin' son of a bitch!

869
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,653
Lyin' son of a bitch!

870
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:54,193
You son of a bitch!

871
00:40:55,158 --> 00:40:57,272
You could have at least
let me keep the job!

872
00:41:08,656 --> 00:41:09,851
What were you thinking?

873
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,651
Pam.

874
00:42:01,537 --> 00:42:02,840
What the hell
happened to you?

875
00:42:05,268 --> 00:42:06,263
I, uh...

876
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:10,481
I brought you something.

877
00:42:15,246 --> 00:42:16,100
You all right?

878
00:42:21,027 --> 00:42:22,303
Why don't you
come inside?

879
00:42:23,217 --> 00:42:24,270
I'll see you in practice.
