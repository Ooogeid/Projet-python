1
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:03,842
Your father was offered
an amazing job at TMU.

2
00:00:04,017 --> 00:00:05,236
We're moving again,
aren't we?

3
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:07,582
Okay, nobody in my family
has gone past high school.

4
00:00:07,623 --> 00:00:08,750
If you turn yourself around

5
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,848
you could get into
a full four-year college.

6
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,543
They diagnosed me
with a bipolar disorder.

7
00:00:13,584 --> 00:00:15,275
It can be dangerous
sometimes.

8
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:16,617
People get really
depressed.

9
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:18,448
Bo tells me
y'all been hanging out.

10
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:19,020
Yeah.

11
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:20,211
He's funny kid.

12
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:21,998
You got your hands
full.

13
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:23,289
Bo can never know.

14
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,493
When you tackled him,
you had your head down.

15
00:00:26,547 --> 00:00:28,590
I cannot believe this--you said
if we were gonna sue anybody,

16
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:29,690
it was gonna be
the school, Dad.

17
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:31,151
I'm not gonna say
it was Coach's fault.

18
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:33,041
Let's just be really,
really honest with each other

19
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:33,770
right now, Jason.

20
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:35,381
Do you wanna
be engaged to me?

21
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:36,582
I don't know.

22
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:39,220
I'm just not gonna be able
to take this team any further.

23
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:40,892
You wanna play big,
think big, all right?

24
00:00:41,526 --> 00:00:42,361
I'm gonna show you how.

25
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:20,980
So what are the chances
of Dad actually taking the job?

26
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:22,311
I don't know, honey.

27
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:25,571
Well, I mean, is it, like,
50/50, 60/40?

28
00:01:25,675 --> 00:01:28,590
There's no point in looking
at statistics like that.

29
00:01:28,627 --> 00:01:29,821
We just don't know.

30
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,322
30/70?

31
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:35,621
Honey, if I had to say,
I'd say probably 80/20.

32
00:01:36,155 --> 00:01:37,793
80 we're gonna stay in Dillon?

33
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:39,570
Please don't worry.

34
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:42,272
It's not real yet.
It's not official yet.

35
00:01:42,638 --> 00:01:44,512
There's no point
in worrying, all right?

36
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:45,550
It's gonna be okay.

37
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:47,190
I'd at least like to know
where I'll be living.

38
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:48,453
I know, I know.

39
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:51,340
And it just--
it sucks.

40
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:53,140
I can't even talk
to Matt about any of this.

41
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:55,602
I know, sweetheart.
You've mentioned that. Sorry.

42
00:01:57,198 --> 00:02:00,440
Two days to the Texas state
semifinal, y'all.

43
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:01,923
Panthers are goin'.

44
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,263
We're gonna have to face
a tough Brant Viking football team.

45
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:07,402
Now if we can get by
those guys,

46
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:11,590
well, we just might meet
West Cambria in the finals.

47
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:12,800
And I'll tell you what--

48
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:14,493
that would mean
playing our old friend,

49
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:15,950
Ray "Voodoo" Tatum.

50
00:02:15,976 --> 00:02:17,061
Don't turn your body.
Just straight.

51
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,470
Just straight, Saracen.

52
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:19,402
You gotta keep
your head up-field

53
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:20,303
- and keep your feet light.
- Hey...

54
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:21,182
Get back on the line.

55
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:22,671
I think I might
maybe throw up.

56
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:23,893
What, you wanna
go home, Saracen?

57
00:02:24,507 --> 00:02:25,742
I mean, if you wanna
go home, I mean,

58
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:26,492
I got a busy day too.

59
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:28,281
I can go home, pick up a paper,
check in on Oprah.

60
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:30,392
Something wrong
with Oprah, Saracen?

61
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:32,301
No, Oprah's--
I like Oprah.

62
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:33,421
No, nothing is wrong
with Oprah.

63
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:34,771
The team's
defensive linemen,

64
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:36,532
three of them
run a 4-6-40.

65
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:38,890
So that makes them
not only bigger than you

66
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:40,602
but faster than you.

67
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:42,212
They're gonna be
in your chili all night.

68
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:43,993
And unless you listen to me,
you're gonna be eating an awful lot of turf.

69
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:44,831
You want that?

70
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:47,603
No, I don't wanna
eat turf.

71
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:48,410
All right,
then listen.

72
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:49,560
Keep your feet light,

73
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:50,282
okay?

74
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:52,753
As soon as I tell you where
the pressure's coming from,

75
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:53,773
stay on your toes.

76
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:55,262
Get it out quick
so you don't get hit,

77
00:02:55,478 --> 00:02:56,090
all right?

78
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:58,191
Set!

79
00:02:58,877 --> 00:02:59,401
Hut!

80
00:03:00,016 --> 00:03:00,821
Backside pressure.

81
00:03:02,026 --> 00:03:02,760
There you go.

82
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:03,951
There you go.

83
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:06,293
I thought
Ray "Voodoo" Tatum boy

84
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:07,952
went back to Louisiana
to play football.

85
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:09,901
Well, that's where we all
thought he was heading,

86
00:03:09,918 --> 00:03:12,392
but, uh, I'm afraid he got
a better offer in West Cam.

87
00:03:13,545 --> 00:03:15,152
Y'all don't mind
if I park here, do you?

88
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:18,540
Hey, coach, what do you
think your chances are?

89
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:20,642
Settin' up shop
a little early, huh?

90
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:21,511
No, not really.

91
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:23,513
They'll be lining up
before 9:00 to buy tickets.

92
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,602
Can I interest you
in a T-shirt?

93
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:26,191
No.

94
00:03:28,136 --> 00:03:28,980
Hey, Coach!

95
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:33,702
That's spectacular, Buddy.

96
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,880
Lookin' good?

97
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,790
Morning, gentlemen.
Way to get after it.

98
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:53,573
Have a good day,
yeah?

99
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:54,931
All right, sir.

100
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:56,292
Yes, sir.

101
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:00,653
Hey, Coach Carl.

102
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:02,142
Hey.

103
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:02,901
Hi.

104
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:04,902
What the hell's this?

105
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,523
Check it out.
Look.

106
00:04:07,485 --> 00:04:09,431
Uh, the Panthers
are a fine team.

107
00:04:10,526 --> 00:04:11,693
It's gonna be an honor
to play 'em.

108
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:13,001
Oh, he's full of crap.

109
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:14,730
That's what he is--
he's full of crap.

110
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:16,491
Can I ask you something?
What are you doing?

111
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:18,500
Is this your living room
or something? I don't--

112
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:19,623
You're sitting here eating.

113
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,572
You're spilling food
all over the place.

114
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:23,373
Well, good morning
to you too.

115
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:24,721
You look out here
lately?

116
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:26,640
Looks like we're playing
the damn Super Bowl.

117
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:27,810
Well, they're excited
about it.

118
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:28,771
Well, I'm glad
they're excited.

119
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:29,992
I wish they were
as excited about winning

120
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:30,983
as they are making a buck.

121
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:31,863
Hey, morning.

122
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:32,400
Morning.

123
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:34,041
Isn't everything
awesome out there?

124
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:35,670
I mean,
everybody is fired up.

125
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:38,462
Hey, that's the most fantastic
logo I've ever seen!

126
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:38,880
Thank you.

127
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:40,922
- I appreciate it.
- That's an incredible-looking piece of art

128
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,242
that you put outside there.

129
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:43,461
It's not art.
It's just a logo.

130
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:44,491
- Oh, it's incredible.
- Yeah.

131
00:04:44,556 --> 00:04:46,671
Listen, I need to talk to you
about those sideline passes.

132
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:49,670
I got two big fleet buyer customers
coming in from San Antonio.

133
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:51,182
It won't be near the team,

134
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:52,602
- just near the exit.
- I'll just come back later.

135
00:04:52,618 --> 00:04:55,092
No, you stay right there.
I gotta talk to my quarterback right now.

136
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:55,913
All right. Hey, Matt,

137
00:04:56,615 --> 00:04:57,893
- good game this weekend.
- Thanks.

138
00:04:57,936 --> 00:04:58,953
- Thanks, Buddy
- It's on you, buddy.

139
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:00,020
Think about that.

140
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:01,710
I--I will.
Thank you.

141
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:04,533
- What?
- Um...

142
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:14,091
Where the hell
did you get this?

143
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:15,690
It was--it was just
in my locker.

144
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:17,471
I don't even know where it
came from. But should--

145
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,358
- What should I do with it?
- Keep this between you and me.

146
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:20,629
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

147
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:28,742
What the hell was that?

148
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:44,001

152
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:24,473
I don't even see
the point of us

153
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,773
going to this settlement
conference.

154
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:27,601
They're never gonna
pay us what we need.

155
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:28,622
Maybe they will, Ma.

156
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:29,893
Maybe it'll be enough.

157
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:32,162
Honey, I'm sorry, but
we gotta be realistic here.

158
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:33,651
We don't know your ability to

159
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:35,303
support yourself in the future.

160
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:37,090
And your father and I aren't
going to be around forever.

161
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:39,963
I'll go,

162
00:06:40,185 --> 00:06:41,013
I'll listen.

163
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:42,301
But I'm skeptical.

164
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:44,472
We are live on the scene
of a train derailment

165
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:46,423
that took place
just a few minutes ago.

166
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:48,050
As you can see behind me here

167
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:48,752
- on the southwest approach...
- Hey, Dad.

168
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:50,242
Yeah.
Dad, check this out.

169
00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:52,951
...has jumped the tracks.

170
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:54,442
Is--ooh!

171
00:06:55,258 --> 00:06:57,142
Is that-- Yeah, that's near
the school, isn't it?

172
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:57,883
What?

173
00:06:57,947 --> 00:07:01,460
...a chemical spill, and
evacuation may be necessary.

174
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:03,350
Everybody gather around here.

175
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:05,331
I don't wanna
give you mixed signals,

176
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:08,393
but we do have
some reason for alarm.

177
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:10,741
Now, I have been talking
to the police,

178
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:12,793
and they have informed me

179
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:15,012
that until they get a handle

180
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:16,840
on what's goin' on out there,

181
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:18,740
we're gonna have
to evacuate the school.

182
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:20,750
Now, that means you're all
gonna be able to go on home.

183
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:22,392
Hold on! Wait a minute!

184
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:23,830
I want you to avoid

185
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:25,532
that northeast sector,

186
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:27,413
northeast of
the football field.

187
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:29,163
We don't know
how dangerous it is.

188
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:30,800
Listen up,
football players.

189
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:32,683
We will have practice today,
you understand?

190
00:07:32,748 --> 00:07:34,020
The location
will be determined.

191
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:35,932
Right now, y'all stay
in touch with each other,

192
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,041
let everyone know,
you understand?

193
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:38,830
All right, go do
what they're telling you to do.

194
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:40,983
- Hey.
- Hey!

195
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:44,791
What's this for?

196
00:07:45,707 --> 00:07:46,633
Because I love you.

197
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:47,582
Good morning, Tyra.

198
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:48,653
How you doing?

199
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:50,883
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

200
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:52,391
I'll call you later.

201
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:53,690
Uh, yeah.

202
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:54,272
Bye-bye.

203
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:57,010
Where's she goin'?

204
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,302
She's going to the library.
She has some algebra final.

205
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,791
She's going
to the library?

206
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,223
Yeah.

207
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:05,822
I'll let y'all talk

208
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:07,412
or whatever y'all were doing.

209
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,821
- Why are you lookin' at me so weird?
- I'm just curious where you're going.

210
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:13,011
I gotta go, um...

211
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,312
You gotta
return some books?

212
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:15,702
I freaked out a little bit.

213
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,381
Okay. Don't worry about it.
You don't want to date a nut-job.

214
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:18,912
I get it, okay?
You're off the hook.

215
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:20,700
Wait. I wanna make this
work on the real,

216
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:21,572
but you gotta tell me--

217
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:22,773
I mean, where do we even start?

218
00:08:23,017 --> 00:08:24,521
Smash, move it along!
Let's go!

219
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:24,923
Look...

220
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:28,783
Look, I gotta--

221
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:29,890
Go.

222
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:36,741
You know,
that's what I get

223
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:38,322
for going out with
the star running back

224
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:39,603
on the Dillon Panthers.

225
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:42,313
My boyfriend
went off to Austin

226
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,052
and got a tattoo
from some girl

227
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:46,003
and comes back and acts
like nothing happened.

228
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:48,293
And it's absolutely clear
that something happened.

229
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,422
Wait, how do you know that
something definitely happened?

230
00:08:50,465 --> 00:08:51,953
Because it did.
He has a tattoo.

231
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:53,660
Are you listening to me?

232
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:54,203
Yeah.

233
00:08:54,745 --> 00:08:56,520
And the fact that
I've called him four times

234
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:58,193
and he hasn't called back
kinda says something.

235
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:00,342
Wow. Okay, you know
what's wrong with that story?

236
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:01,961
That he hasn't
called me back?

237
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:05,162
No, the fact that you called
him or anyone four times.

238
00:09:05,206 --> 00:09:07,200
I mean, good God, girl,
look at you.

239
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,483
Okay, so what
do I do, then?

240
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:17,970
Can we do this all day?

241
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:21,391
Not bad,
cheerleader.

242
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:23,782
Are both these
yours?

243
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:25,780
No, they're my dad's.
He collects them.

244
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:29,410
Okay, make sure you hold your
hand kinda like further back.

245
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:30,021
Yeah.

246
00:09:31,215 --> 00:09:33,223
Beats the hell outta making
Rice Krispies treats.

247
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:39,303
Tyra!

248
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,500
That you?
What are you doin' here?

249
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:43,900
Oh, nothing.

250
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:44,981
Just wishing I could,

251
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:46,712
you know,
build a time machine

252
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:49,201
and go back and shoot
whoever it is invented algebra.

253
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:50,640
- That's for sure.
- See, that's kinda

254
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:52,022
a catch-22, though,
because

255
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:53,812
to invent that time machine,
you may need

256
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:54,902
to use algebra, so...

257
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:58,370
You know, I already
have a tutor, if that's--

258
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,261
- So you can just, yeah, run along.
- Okay.

259
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:01,593
Let me ask you
one question, though.

260
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:03,973
Um, did your tutor

261
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:06,272
teach Tim Riggins to read
in about a day and a half?

262
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,570
No? Okay.

263
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:11,183
Is your tutor the top
of his calculus honors class?

264
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:11,990
Shh.

265
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:12,733
Okay.

266
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:16,082
Did your tutor score a 77

267
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:18,342
on his PSAT math portion?

268
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:20,010
No? I just really think

269
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:21,631
you need the A-Team on this.

270
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:22,613
And you got Mr. T

271
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:23,930
standin' right in front of you.

272
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:25,773
And T stands--

273
00:10:27,765 --> 00:10:30,432
for Tyra's algebra tutor.

274
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:33,721
Right?

275
00:10:33,827 --> 00:10:34,400
Seriously?

276
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:35,611
I'm really good at math.

277
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:40,700
I'm outta here.
I have to go pick him up.

278
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,160
I'm sure Bo's
the last kid there,

279
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,613
and he's probably
scared out of his mind.

280
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:46,173
Thank you.

281
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:48,391
What?

282
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:50,250
Tim picked me up.

283
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,572
- Well, hey
- School got cancelled.

284
00:10:52,616 --> 00:10:54,943
Lucky for you. I'm so glad.
I was worried about you.

285
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,383
Okay, go in the break room
and go do your homework.

286
00:10:58,537 --> 00:10:59,542
There's cookies
in there.

287
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,180
Oh, boy!

288
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:02,510
Right around the corner.

289
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:04,390
- Thank you.
- Hey.

290
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:05,350
That was very sweet of you,

291
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,403
- picking him up for me.
- No problem.

292
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:07,180
I was worried.

293
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:09,512
It's probably not
a good idea

294
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:10,873
for you to come in here,
though.

295
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:12,060
Because...

296
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:12,971
Why?

297
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:14,983
Well, because
it's a small town--

298
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:16,630
- Hey, 33.
- Hey.

299
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,281
Better buckle up
that chin strap.

300
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:20,312
I hear those Viking boys
bring the wood.

301
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:22,252
Oh, you bet.
We got it covered, though, sir.

302
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:23,271
No worries.

303
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:26,701
- 'Cause it's a small t--
- What do you want for dinner tonight?

304
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:28,142
What?

305
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:29,920
I know Bo likes pizza, so

306
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,853
we may as well grab
some of that or something.

307
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:34,453
Sound good?

308
00:11:34,766 --> 00:11:36,191
Okay.
It's great.

309
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:46,762
This is ridiculous.
We're the freaking Dillon Panthers.

310
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:47,873
Get him, Spike.

311
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:49,801
Man, this is worse
than Pee-Wee.

312
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:52,423
I think Coach T.
done lost his mind.

313
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:53,672
Hey, listen up.

314
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:56,093
Everybody form over here
on the benches right now. Let's go.

315
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:56,671
Go!

316
00:11:56,735 --> 00:11:58,621
Come on, let's go, now.
We got a lot to do today.

317
00:11:58,696 --> 00:11:59,141
Go!

318
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:02,760
Bunch of crybabies.

319
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:04,421
I don't wanna hear
this crap anymore.

320
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:06,900
You win a few games,
think you're special,

321
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:08,051
think you're too good
to practice here.

322
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:09,763
I don't wanna hear
that crap anymore.

323
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:10,461
You know who you--

324
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,250
You know
who I'm talkin' about.

325
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,872
Matt Saracen
found $200 in his locker.

326
00:12:19,796 --> 00:12:20,503
Who else?

327
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:27,211
Nobody else.

328
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:29,881
Nobody.

329
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:32,162
Not in your locker?

330
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:33,921
Not anywhere at school?

331
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,582
Not at home, nothin',
anywhere, anytime?

332
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,600
That must piss you off,
Smash.

333
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:41,940
Come on, let's go!

334
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:43,351
- Coach.
- Coach.

335
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:44,933
Coach!
Coach!

336
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:49,572
I think you're gonna
want to hear this, Eric.

337
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:50,753
Hey, Mayor.
How you doing?

338
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:51,683
- Okay.
- You all right, hon?

339
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:52,102
Yeah.

340
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:52,911
What's going on?

341
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:54,863
We just heard from the EPA,

342
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:56,422
and they are keeping
the school closed

343
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:57,880
while they investigate
the accident.

344
00:12:58,207 --> 00:12:59,670
Yeah. something about
toxic fumes.

345
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:02,331
They have to evaluate
the air quality, Buddy.

346
00:13:02,987 --> 00:13:04,370
It's gonna be
at least a week.

347
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:05,411
A week?

348
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:07,972
There is no way you're gonna
have a home game this Friday.

349
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,552
It's a great facility.
We seats 12,000.

350
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:18,271
Six-month old field turf, Coach.

351
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,562
check out the state-of-the-art
press box up there.

352
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:23,990
- Coach, hi-def if you need it.
- We're gonna pass.

353
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:26,292
- I'm sorry, what?
- We're gonna pass.

354
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:26,860
You're gonna--

355
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:27,841
Y'all signed a deal

356
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:29,120
we'd get a home game.

357
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:31,813
And you know damn well this is a lot
closer to Brant than it is Dillon.

358
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:32,953
A lot closer.

359
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:34,662
Now you're just splitting
hairs, aren't we, Coach?

360
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:36,363
- This isn't splitting any hairs.
- It's 20 miles of difference...

361
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:37,171
Come on,
don't try to hustle me.

362
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:39,341
I saw the damn Vikings banner
back there in the weight room.

363
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:40,940
I don't understand
what the problem is.

364
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,002
I know you train here.

365
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:44,183
I imagine you
practice here, play here.

366
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:45,841
Can I ask you
a question too?

367
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:47,652
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

368
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:50,951
What--does your brother
run the clock up there?

369
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,111
Is that--
that part of the deal?

370
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:54,892
Coach, you know--

371
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:58,983
Don't make this
a pride thing, Coach.

372
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:01,403
- I said I'd split the rental 70/30.
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,010
Not here, gentlemen.

374
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,000
Eric?

375
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,240
Not gonna be here.

376
00:14:07,707 --> 00:14:09,150
Fine club seating,

377
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:12,090
which would have been great
for my VIPs and my sponsors.

378
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:14,511
You know, I'm real sorry
that you lost your sponsorship.

379
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:16,432
Tell you what, why don't you
go out to Herrmann field

380
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:17,161
and just buy that

381
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:19,920
and you can just call it
"The Garrity Bowl"?

382
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:20,832
Huh.

383
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,711
Are namin' rights available?

384
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:28,302
Ad sales

385
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:31,812
and ticket revenues--
that's what pays your salary.

386
00:14:32,777 --> 00:14:34,542
My players have been
receiving gifts.

387
00:14:36,388 --> 00:14:37,651
Cash gifts, Buddy.

388
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:39,533
Is that right?

389
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:45,191
...eat all that food
by yourself?

390
00:14:47,515 --> 00:14:48,602
- See you later.
- Call me, girl.

391
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:53,041
That's all right.

392
00:14:59,068 --> 00:14:59,821
Hey, Lyla.

393
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:01,520
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

394
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:02,871
Yeah.

395
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:05,790
Since when did you and Waverly
get to be so friendly?

396
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:07,861
You know, I've been cheering
for you all these years,

397
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:09,480
and we've never said
so much as a "hey."

398
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:12,592
And now you see me
with Waverly Grady, and...

399
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,330
Look, I'm just--
I'm just asking.

400
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:16,153
Great.

401
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:19,322
You better be careful.
She's a good shot.

402
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:21,440
What is that
supposed to mean?

403
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,253
We went shooting
yesterday.

404
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:24,633
Two girls
packing heat.

405
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,893
No, no, no.
That's not a good idea.

406
00:15:26,938 --> 00:15:27,602
What?

407
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:28,851
Why?

408
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:30,480
God, Smash.

409
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:32,600
- You're not her father.
- Lyla, it's not about--

410
00:15:32,656 --> 00:15:34,250
She doesn't have to answer you
for everything that she does.

411
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:35,081
Lyla, Lyla.
She's bipolar.

412
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,003
What?

413
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:37,462
Waverly's bipolar.

414
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:40,190
And she's not taking
her meds.

415
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:42,222
Which means...

416
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:45,240
I don't even know
what that means.

417
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:47,500
But I'm damn sure
she shouldn't be shooting guns.

418
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:54,340
I didn't know.

419
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:56,352
Now you do.

420
00:15:59,395 --> 00:16:00,912
That's not answering
the question.

421
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:02,910
Yeah, well, Eric,

422
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,932
I don't think
I understand the question.

423
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,730
You don't know anything about
that, do you, cash gifts?

424
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,541
I don't think
we should be focusing on that.

425
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:09,800
I think we need to focus on

426
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,242
where we're gonna play
the football game.

427
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:14,833
You have any idea where we're
gonna play the football game?

428
00:16:14,856 --> 00:16:16,603
You got a plan B
here for me?

429
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,261
Come on.
Let's go get a beer.

430
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:37,731
Come on.

431
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:39,873
Okay, now what do you got

432
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,180
after you take off
the times three?

433
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:43,912
Okay. The square root of X
equals 7.

434
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:45,780
How do you get rid of
that pesky little

435
00:16:46,027 --> 00:16:47,003
square root right there?

436
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:48,422
- Square both sides.
- Mm-hmm.

437
00:16:48,897 --> 00:16:49,483
Good.

438
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:50,821
You square both sides--

439
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,412
You know, if you love
math so much,

440
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:54,252
why don't you just start
your own little math club,

441
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:55,603
and that way you can
do math all day long.

442
00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:58,352
Well, you see, I did,
but no-nobody showed up.

443
00:16:58,408 --> 00:16:59,280
Yeah, that's shocking.

444
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:00,571
Really.

445
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:02,753
You know, all this bitterness
that you're showing me

446
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:03,612
really isn't helping.

447
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:05,603
You know, I appreciate the fact that
you're talking to me and everything,

448
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:06,820
but it's not really--

449
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:08,323
it's not really helping
matters.

450
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:10,323
So could we just maybe
solve for X?

451
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:11,023
All right,

452
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:12,801
X equals...

453
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:13,611
49?

454
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:20,863
I'm just playing.
That's right.

455
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:22,502
- Bastard!
- I'm just playing.

456
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:23,503
I hate you!

457
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:24,910
That wasn't funny,
was it?

458
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:28,792
Good job. Congratulations.
You got it all by yourself.

459
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:33,563
Um, if you're not doing
anything on

460
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:34,352
Friday, maybe we could

461
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:35,361
- get together and study?
- Yes.

462
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:36,880
Study. Yeah.

463
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:37,530
Great.

464
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:39,473
It's a date, then.

465
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:44,363
Let's do the next
problem.

466
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:46,812
Hey, hon?

467
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:47,562
Hey, baby.

468
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:50,782
Phone's been ringing
off the hook for you.

469
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:51,412
I'll tell you right now...

470
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:53,641
You need to come along with me.
You need to turn that off right now.

471
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,681
Where would people park?

472
00:17:57,896 --> 00:17:58,610
I don't know.

473
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:01,270
And how would you
put lights in here?

474
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:02,252
I don't know that
either.

475
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:06,563
Where would...
people pee?

476
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:07,450
Well, I don't know.

477
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:08,951
They could use cups
for all I care.

478
00:18:08,986 --> 00:18:10,150
I--I don't know.

479
00:18:10,626 --> 00:18:11,502
Cows agree with me.

480
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,623
I don't see why
you can't agree.

481
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:14,140
- Sweetie, I'm not disagreeing.
- The cows are more...

482
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:15,221
supportive than you are.

483
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:16,263
You know I'm supportive.

484
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:17,681
I'm just thinking, you know,

485
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:18,883
you've got a lot on your mind.

486
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:19,942
You got this TMU thing,

487
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,682
you know, the lawsuit.
I mean,

488
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:23,371
this may not be
the clearest thought

489
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:24,291
that you've had in a while.

490
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:26,072
I'm getting pressured

491
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:28,543
into giving up my home field
advantage right now.

492
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,932
You know, I'm gettin' players
who are receiving gifts,

493
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,520
and I've got a damn town
that's full of--

494
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:34,613
I don't know,
they're money hungry!

495
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:36,031
- I know, babe.
- The whole damn thing--

496
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:36,800
I know, I know.

497
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:38,983
I'm just--
all I wanna do is just--

498
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:47,182
Close your eyes.

499
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:53,701
Pretend you're
ten years old again.

500
00:18:57,096 --> 00:18:58,362
You're just playin'.

501
00:18:58,975 --> 00:19:00,580
You're just playing.

502
00:19:03,747 --> 00:19:05,080
I wanna play football.

503
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:06,522
I know.

504
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:20,761
Where you goin'?

505
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:22,290
I'm gonna go to the truck
and get some blankets.

506
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:28,483
You know Buddy Garrity's head's
gonna explode.

507
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:32,633
I love it!

508
00:19:33,217 --> 00:19:34,202
I love it!

509
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:38,921
All right, listen up.

510
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:41,361
Need about 20 cans
of orange spray paint.

511
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,161
Need about 20 bags of chalk,

512
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,500
all the dirt that you can find.

513
00:19:44,687 --> 00:19:45,770
I wanna get spades

514
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:46,973
and some metal rakes.

515
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:47,582
Metal rakes.

516
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:48,613
Get two or three of those.

517
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:49,913
We'll start with that,
all right?

518
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:50,830
What are we doing here?

519
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:52,133
We're gonna build
a football field, Saracen.

520
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,223
Quit askin' questions.

521
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:54,902
Man, I can't believe this.

522
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:56,271
I'm supposed to be sleepin' in.

523
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:58,312
Let's just embrace
the suck for once, all right?

524
00:19:58,785 --> 00:19:59,263
Come on.

525
00:19:59,307 --> 00:20:00,491
Hey, I don't like
your attitude.

526
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,052
I get the chalk.

527
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:05,811
Are we just gonna get
out there right now?

528
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:09,111
How you doin'?

529
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:11,191
- Hey, Coach.
- Give you a hand?

530
00:20:12,575 --> 00:20:13,390
- No, sir.
- No?

531
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:13,860
No.

532
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:14,871
Thank you.

533
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:17,780
What ya been up to
lately?

534
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:18,770
Nothin' much.
Just--

535
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:21,990
Picking out some WD-40.

536
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:22,990
Highlight of my day.

537
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:25,813
Not much goin' on,
huh?

538
00:20:27,537 --> 00:20:28,141
No, sir.

539
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,333
See you tonight
at that settlement case?

540
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:31,260
Yes, sir.

541
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:33,460
Sorry.

542
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:34,361
About that.

543
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:36,683
Hell, son, ain't nothing
to be sorry about.

544
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:39,931
That's the best damn news I've
heard since this case began.

545
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:41,412
Lawyers say they might
be able to settle it.

546
00:20:41,468 --> 00:20:43,253
I'm happy about it.
I hope your folks are happy about it.

547
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,831
Yeah, they'll, uh...

548
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:47,431
they'll be there, sir.

549
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:52,013
Well...

550
00:20:57,335 --> 00:20:58,060
All right, then.

551
00:20:58,556 --> 00:20:59,622
It's good
to see you again.

552
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:01,502
You, too, Coach.

553
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:08,721
Yeah?

554
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:15,740
Hi.

555
00:21:16,585 --> 00:21:17,502
We need to talk.

556
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:21,142
Can I have
a glass of water?

557
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:22,223
Yeah.

558
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:28,732
Just put it there.

559
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:35,581
Why haven't you called?

560
00:21:35,655 --> 00:21:36,410
I've been busy.

561
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,080
It doesn't look like
you're busy.

562
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:41,633
It looks like
you're watching TV.

563
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,403
Listen, I know it may be
a lot to ask of you to call me

564
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:48,373
so that I know whether or not
we're engaged,

565
00:21:48,436 --> 00:21:49,470
or boyfriend and girlfriend

566
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:50,493
or just real good pals--

567
00:21:50,536 --> 00:21:52,043
Get off my back, Lyla!

568
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:53,711
What do I have
right now, huh?

569
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,221
I got a girlfriend
who cheated on me.

570
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:56,681
I got parents
who are breaking up

571
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:58,143
'cause of some stupid lawsuit.

572
00:21:58,257 --> 00:21:59,061
I lost the Coach,

573
00:21:59,105 --> 00:21:59,791
lost the team,

574
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:00,721
lost my friends,

575
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:01,873
lost the quad rugby,

576
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:02,791
so I got nothing!

577
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:04,153
So I'm sorry if I'm not being
the perfect

578
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:05,131
boyfriend right now,

579
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,523
but I got a lot more
on my mind

580
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:08,732
than powder puff
and--and prom!

581
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:10,333
And this cup is way too full.

582
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:11,402
I'll spill it, you know tha--

583
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:12,651
No, it's not
too full!

584
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:13,631
What the hell
was that for?

585
00:22:13,678 --> 00:22:15,012
You think it's been
easy for me

586
00:22:15,045 --> 00:22:16,363
to help you in
and out of that chair?

587
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:18,390
Well, no one's holding a gun
to your head, Lyla!

588
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:20,580
I do it because
I love you, stupid!

589
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:22,951
But now you're sitting here
feeling sorry for yourself

590
00:22:22,995 --> 00:22:24,621
and acting like
a jackass all the time.

591
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:25,851
You wanna play rugby?

592
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,103
Find another team.

593
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:28,802
You hate this lawsuit so much,

594
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:30,441
find a way to make it go away.

595
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:33,811
And next time you want
a glass of water, say please.

596
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:40,730
There's our new Toyota Tundra.

597
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:41,890
I got 30 of those.

598
00:22:42,726 --> 00:22:44,282
She's a real beauty.

599
00:22:45,148 --> 00:22:45,781
Eric,

600
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:48,392
just tell me.
What the hell's this all about?

601
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:49,962
What this is about?

602
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:50,642
Yeah.

603
00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:53,303
You know what
this is about?

604
00:22:54,117 --> 00:22:55,471
Man, it's
just about football.

605
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:58,003
It's about playing football
minus the crap.

606
00:22:58,047 --> 00:22:59,233
So is this about
the other day?

607
00:22:59,237 --> 00:23:01,513
Is that what this is, about
the cash in the envelopes?

608
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:03,393
Is that what it is, you're
trying to make a statement?

609
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:05,052
Yeah, fine, okay, great.
It's a statement.

610
00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:06,373
You happy? You're right,
it's a statement.

611
00:23:06,395 --> 00:23:09,402
Okay, well, I don't think
the semifinal playoff game

612
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:11,233
is the time to make
a statement, Eric.

613
00:23:11,287 --> 00:23:14,120
Now, look, I know that
you're being courted by TMU.

614
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:16,481
If you're doin' this
so you can make history

615
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:17,911
'cause you're not gonna
be here,

616
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:19,573
I don't like that one bit.

617
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:22,433
Is that you over there
snickering?

618
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:23,571
Yes, she said date.

619
00:23:23,616 --> 00:23:25,250
- It's a date.
- I know, I know, but

620
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:27,763
"it's a date" is--it's a...
it's a--

621
00:23:27,816 --> 00:23:30,012
it's an expression.
It--it's like a colloquialism

622
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:31,371
- used everywhere.
- Well, she said that expression.

623
00:23:31,387 --> 00:23:32,522
What's that girl's name?

624
00:23:32,617 --> 00:23:33,693
Her name is Tyra.

625
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:34,913
Tyra.

626
00:23:35,078 --> 00:23:37,971
And, you know, I'm really
just about tired of--

627
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:39,242
of being a supporting actor.

628
00:23:39,256 --> 00:23:41,203
I'm about ready
to be a leading man, Matt.

629
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:42,152
Okay.

630
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:43,663
You know, that's gonna be
a big night for us,

631
00:23:43,668 --> 00:23:45,460
so you might as well
just accept that.

632
00:23:45,545 --> 00:23:47,022
I accept--
it's gonna be a huge night.

633
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:48,353
I mean, you're probably gonna

634
00:23:48,568 --> 00:23:49,923
square a lot of numbers,

635
00:23:49,955 --> 00:23:51,192
maybe figure out a quadratic

636
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:52,853
equation or something like that.

637
00:23:52,895 --> 00:23:54,943
That's really cute; I'm
really laughing on the inside.

638
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:56,182
No, it's adorable,
what you're doing.

639
00:23:56,298 --> 00:23:56,863
I know, it is.

640
00:23:57,216 --> 00:23:58,432
You know what, Matt?

641
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:00,710
I-I-I'm gonna go,

642
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:02,332
and I'm gonna
tell her how I feel.

643
00:24:02,557 --> 00:24:04,672
I'm gonna--I'm gonna
declare myself to her.

644
00:24:05,806 --> 00:24:06,442
Okay?

645
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:07,931
And you need
to just accept that.

646
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,752
Carl, not--not too tight,

647
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:11,430
- please.
- All right, okay.

648
00:24:11,468 --> 00:24:13,660
I don't want to look all frayed
when I go and see my lady.

649
00:24:14,476 --> 00:24:16,043
I just hope
I wasn't too harsh on him.

650
00:24:16,075 --> 00:24:17,511
You needed
to let him know.

651
00:24:18,947 --> 00:24:19,553
Yeah.

652
00:24:23,165 --> 00:24:24,751
You know who's really
good to talk to?

653
00:24:25,316 --> 00:24:28,372
Uh, Mrs. Taylor,
the counselor.

654
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:30,833
She's great.

655
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,820
Did Smash talk to you?

656
00:24:52,747 --> 00:24:55,612
You told Lyla Garrity
that I'm bipolar?

657
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:57,211
I love you, okay?

658
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,301
I love you, okay?

659
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:01,150
And you're right.
I have no idea what you're dealing with.

660
00:25:01,307 --> 00:25:02,931
But you're not
helping me, okay?

661
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:05,153
You tell me you're sick, but
you're not taking your pills.

662
00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:07,152
And then you start acting
a little crazy.

663
00:25:07,218 --> 00:25:09,163
And now you're doing things
to endanger yourself

664
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:10,602
and everybody else
around you.

665
00:25:10,947 --> 00:25:13,843
I'm the only one who knows
about it, and I can't tell nobody?

666
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:15,520
No, no, that's not fair,

667
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:17,112
okay?
I'd do anything for you,

668
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:18,341
but that's too much.

669
00:25:19,888 --> 00:25:21,413
I think you need to talk
to somebody,

670
00:25:21,976 --> 00:25:23,251
maybe your dad or--

671
00:25:23,307 --> 00:25:24,523
No, I can't talk
to my dad.

672
00:25:24,905 --> 00:25:25,940
- No.
- What about my mom?

673
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,423
- Why?
- She's a nurse.

674
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:29,191
She's a nurse,
and she knows you.

675
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:30,521
She can help.

676
00:25:31,258 --> 00:25:33,071
'Cause, baby,
I don't think you're okay.

677
00:25:34,895 --> 00:25:38,270
And you can stay mad at me if you want to,
but it's not gonna change my mind...

678
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:42,893
about anything
I just said.

679
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:07,721
Where the hell you going?

680
00:26:08,238 --> 00:26:08,833
Jackie's.

681
00:26:09,496 --> 00:26:10,570
You're going over
to Jackie's again.

682
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:12,850
Is that kid calling you
Daddy yet?

683
00:26:14,498 --> 00:26:15,820
Doesn't know
anything about it.

684
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:19,542
I might not have a PhD in stupid
like you do,

685
00:26:20,338 --> 00:26:22,463
but I'm gonna tell you right now,
this is gonna turn out badly.

686
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:26,003
And, hell, it's probably
gonna end badly right around State.

687
00:26:29,377 --> 00:26:30,780
The school district
has immunity,

688
00:26:31,437 --> 00:26:31,721
okay?

689
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:33,781
So when the court lets us out
on summary judgment,

690
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:35,681
all you're gonna have left
is Coach Taylor.

691
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:38,162
And I'll bet you can take
everything he has

692
00:26:38,325 --> 00:26:39,111
and double it,

693
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:40,700
and it won't even cover your fee.

694
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,501
I don't care who pays us.

695
00:26:42,945 --> 00:26:45,011
But I want you to have a good
look at that boy right there.

696
00:26:45,585 --> 00:26:48,841
Because when I put him
on the stand in his wheelchair

697
00:26:49,077 --> 00:26:50,571
and he tells his story,

698
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:53,352
there is not a jury
in Carr County

699
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,361
that is not gonna give us three times

700
00:26:55,418 --> 00:26:56,252
what it is we're asking for.

701
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:57,343
You know,
is that all I am here?

702
00:26:58,245 --> 00:26:58,700
Huh?

703
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:00,582
Just some cripple boy
that you can wheel out

704
00:27:00,637 --> 00:27:02,281
in front of a bunch of people
to make some money off me?

705
00:27:02,296 --> 00:27:02,793
Jason.

706
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:04,280
Talk about lost
earning capacity

707
00:27:04,316 --> 00:27:05,421
like I'm some
brain-dead idiot

708
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:06,603
who's never
gonna get a job again.

709
00:27:06,685 --> 00:27:07,542
Okay, all right.

710
00:27:07,587 --> 00:27:08,513
Mitch, we need to take a break.

711
00:27:08,568 --> 00:27:09,662
Seriously, Mom, Dad,

712
00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:12,712
I know it's been hard on you guys,
but we are not here to win the lottery.

713
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:15,793
So how 'bout--how 'bout I

714
00:27:15,857 --> 00:27:17,541
just write down
what I want,

715
00:27:18,576 --> 00:27:19,433
and we call it a night?

716
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:24,242
That takes care
of the debt, right?

717
00:27:25,027 --> 00:27:25,773
Saves the house?

718
00:27:28,677 --> 00:27:29,323
Jason...

719
00:27:31,505 --> 00:27:33,303
Jason, I just want you
to be okay.

720
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:36,623
I just want you
to have a good life.

721
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:38,683
I'm gonna be fine.

722
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:40,852
You just gotta have faith
in me, okay?

723
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:42,933
Can you do that?

724
00:27:45,616 --> 00:27:46,773
- Okay.
- Okay.

725
00:28:00,775 --> 00:28:02,021
I think we can live
with this.

726
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:13,911
How you doin', Coach?

727
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:15,202
Good to see you.

728
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:16,783
This is ridiculous.

729
00:28:16,925 --> 00:28:19,371
And what's worse is you're
actually serious about this.

730
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:20,552
Just let him read it to you.

731
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:21,640
We shouldn't be having
this conversation.

732
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:22,471
"Article one.

733
00:28:22,596 --> 00:28:24,553
"The field
shall be a rectangular area

734
00:28:24,685 --> 00:28:27,633
"with dimensions, lines,
goals, and pylons

735
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:29,932
as shown in the diagrams
in appendix A."

736
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:31,412
Now, you can measure
as many times as you want,

737
00:28:31,457 --> 00:28:32,181
but this is
an official field.

738
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:34,701
I don't give a da--I don't
care what the damn book says.

739
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:35,770
We're not playing here.

740
00:28:35,825 --> 00:28:37,480
- It's a football field.
- It's a joke!

741
00:28:37,538 --> 00:28:39,290
It's not a joke.
It's a damn well-built

742
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:40,583
- football field.
- Look at this.

743
00:28:40,638 --> 00:28:41,363
Look at this--this--

744
00:28:42,148 --> 00:28:44,970
This is the state
semifinals,

745
00:28:45,285 --> 00:28:47,280
for God's sake.
I got my fans to think about.

746
00:28:47,316 --> 00:28:48,691
What are you worried
about your fans for?

747
00:28:48,718 --> 00:28:50,530
I mean,
it's a sellout game.

748
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:52,311
We're gonna be able
to get 'em all in here.

749
00:28:52,348 --> 00:28:53,342
You've already
made your money.

750
00:28:53,595 --> 00:28:54,990
It's not about
the money, Coach.

751
00:28:55,045 --> 00:28:56,871
I wasn't saying
it was about the money.

752
00:28:56,928 --> 00:28:57,480
I'm just say--

753
00:28:57,585 --> 00:29:00,242
Well, I'm just curious about
what the problem is, Brandon.

754
00:29:01,936 --> 00:29:02,803
Well, typically,

755
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:05,731
what goes along with a football
game is a football stadium.

756
00:29:05,797 --> 00:29:06,353
Yes, sir.

757
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:08,531
You know,
with good goal posts

758
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:11,052
and something that's not battery
operated for a scoreboard.

759
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:12,250
Oh, so I see.
I understand it.

760
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:13,470
You have a problem

761
00:29:14,138 --> 00:29:15,950
comin' down here
without your fancy stadium

762
00:29:15,976 --> 00:29:18,143
and your high-tech gear because
you're gonna get your keisters beat.

763
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:19,092
What I'm saying is

764
00:29:19,185 --> 00:29:20,280
it's a football game.

765
00:29:20,316 --> 00:29:22,211
What you need for a football
game is a football field,

766
00:29:22,275 --> 00:29:23,750
22 kids, and a pigskin.

767
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,392
Gentlemen, are we gonna make
a decision sometime here today?

768
00:29:28,648 --> 00:29:30,321
- Come on.
- All right, I tell you what, Coach, look.

769
00:29:31,425 --> 00:29:32,602
It's--it's obvious

770
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:35,451
that you and your fine
folks at Dillon

771
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:37,640
are having a really
rough time right now.

772
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:40,060
We are, and I appreciate
your concern.

773
00:29:40,217 --> 00:29:40,853
You're welcome.

774
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:42,271
Furthermore, my boys

775
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:43,980
could kick your boys' butts

776
00:29:44,017 --> 00:29:46,750
in an ice skating rink
wearin' nothing but socks

777
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,853
if they had to.

778
00:29:48,068 --> 00:29:49,000
So let me tell you,

779
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:51,462
if you wanna go ahead and play
on--on this field,

780
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,812
butch up, Sally,
'cause you got a game.

781
00:29:56,516 --> 00:29:57,321
Thanks, Coach.

782
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:24,522
Good evening, Panther faithful,

783
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,841
and welcome to the most
talked about football game

784
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:28,082
in the state of Texas.

785
00:30:28,237 --> 00:30:30,083
We are playing
this football game

786
00:30:30,216 --> 00:30:32,780
in a cow pasture for lease.

787
00:30:32,886 --> 00:30:34,710
Not since the days
of the leather helmet

788
00:30:34,717 --> 00:30:36,493
have we seen the likes
of this here in Dillon.

789
00:30:36,528 --> 00:30:38,691
And you know what,
I'm dating myself, sports fans,

790
00:30:38,748 --> 00:30:41,142
but this has a feel
of Woodstock out here.

791
00:30:41,335 --> 00:30:42,963
And you know what,
I half expect to see

792
00:30:42,996 --> 00:30:46,133
the legendary Jimi Hendrix come out
here to play the national anthem.

793
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:49,090
Yeah, I'm supposed
to have 50-yard-line seats.

794
00:30:49,216 --> 00:30:51,053
Tonight you get to sit
anywhere you want.

795
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:52,841
It's just a big, wide,
open space out there.

796
00:30:52,856 --> 00:30:53,830
- All right.
- Enjoy.

797
00:30:54,876 --> 00:30:56,023
Nice field, Tex.

798
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:57,410
Is your mama a goat roper?

799
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:58,582
You can't even get in my head.

800
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:00,023
You can't even get
in my head, baby.

801
00:31:00,078 --> 00:31:00,971
Bring it on the field.

802
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,480
Dillon, call the toss.

803
00:31:06,556 --> 00:31:08,401
- Tails.
- He calls tails.

804
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:09,711
It is tails.

805
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:10,683
We want the ball.

806
00:31:10,966 --> 00:31:12,130
Oh, sweet Mary,

807
00:31:12,395 --> 00:31:14,001
Gainey started
with an onside kick.

808
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:15,503
Liam picks up the ball.

809
00:31:15,726 --> 00:31:16,681
Oh, he's hit!

810
00:31:16,748 --> 00:31:19,323
He fumbles. He fumbles the ball.
Brant picks it up.

811
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:21,460
Oh, no!
He is gonna go.

812
00:31:21,487 --> 00:31:22,940
He's got the outside.

813
00:31:23,165 --> 00:31:25,263
And he's got
a posse goin' in.

814
00:31:25,465 --> 00:31:26,512
Touchdown!

815
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:29,633
Oh, my!
Touchdown, Vikings.

816
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:33,190
And the Panthers just get
whacked right out of the gate.

817
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,182
Holy smokes.
Sneaky, sneaky.

818
00:31:36,418 --> 00:31:38,010
Brant lines up
for the extra point.

819
00:31:38,456 --> 00:31:39,592
There's the snap.

820
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,442
Oh, it's a fake.
He rolls right.

821
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:43,042
He's got--
It's in the end zone.

822
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:44,510
Two points!

823
00:31:44,577 --> 00:31:47,753
And bam!
The Vikings up eight-nothing.

824
00:31:47,816 --> 00:31:49,230
Two trick plays.

825
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:51,873
The gauntlet has
definitely been thrown down.

826
00:31:52,058 --> 00:31:53,863
This should be
one hell of a brawl.

827
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,803
Oh, my, folks.

828
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:57,442
It is raining in Texas.

829
00:31:57,446 --> 00:32:01,591
And Coach Taylor's field of dreams
may have just become a nightmare.

830
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:03,723
You gotta be kidding me.

831
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:05,651
Don't--don't do this
to me right now.

832
00:32:07,765 --> 00:32:10,022
- Tonight, you're gonna do this to me.
- Okay.

833
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,100
Well, that's fun.

834
00:32:18,226 --> 00:32:19,080
Thank you!

835
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:24,641
...slips, and he goes down

836
00:32:24,658 --> 00:32:26,353
after a three-yard pickup,

837
00:32:26,387 --> 00:32:28,750
and another four are
sliding through the mud.

838
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,893
I'll tell you, folks,
these people are...

839
00:32:31,218 --> 00:32:32,132
Why aren't you
at the game?

840
00:32:33,246 --> 00:32:34,603
Got an algebra exam
next week.

841
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:35,891
Semifinals or no semifinals,

842
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:36,831
you know what I'm sayin'?

843
00:32:36,928 --> 00:32:38,643
- I remember those days.
- Yeah.

844
00:32:39,247 --> 00:32:41,431
Under four minutes left to go
in the half, folks.

845
00:32:41,455 --> 00:32:45,350
The storm is here, and it is
a real Texas toad strangler.

846
00:32:45,835 --> 00:32:47,653
Our boys have been bogged down
the entire half.

847
00:32:47,698 --> 00:32:49,840
It's second and 14
from our own 40.

848
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:52,031
Saracen hands it to Riggins
off the left side.

849
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:53,603
Oh, he's hit hard, fumbles.

850
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:57,460
There's a scramble.
Panthers are going for it.

851
00:32:57,567 --> 00:32:59,510
The Vikings have it.
No!

852
00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:02,890
Oh, no! The ball is out of
bounds at the 30 yard line.

853
00:33:02,925 --> 00:33:04,920
And Coach Taylor
and the Panthers

854
00:33:04,956 --> 00:33:07,211
just dodged a muddy bullet
there, folks.

855
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:12,583
48,

856
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:13,660
set, hut!

857
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,450
The ball is tipped!

858
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:23,631
Oh, no! Interception!

859
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:26,100
Interception!
Vikings have the ball.

860
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:28,912
Things have just gone
from bad to worse.

861
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:29,710
What are you doing?

862
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,322
You can't hold that slant
against these guys.

863
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,140
They're too big.
What are you doing, huh?

864
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:35,312
Get your head together.

865
00:33:36,017 --> 00:33:37,130
Hey, Saracen,

866
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:38,802
you've got this, okay?

867
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:40,783
Just remember
what we talked about.

868
00:33:40,846 --> 00:33:42,800
You gotta stay tall.
You gotta look over the line.

869
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:44,410
You're sitting back
on your heels.

870
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:45,522
That's why you're
throwin' 'em short.

871
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:46,943
Get your head in it, baby.

872
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:48,262
Let's go, D!

873
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:50,602
It's fourth down and one yard
to go for a first, folks.

874
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:52,350
And Coach Taylor
is goin' for it

875
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:53,493
here at the end
of the half.

876
00:33:53,606 --> 00:33:55,441
He needs something.
Down by eight.

877
00:33:55,937 --> 00:33:57,180
Saracen over the ball.

878
00:33:57,228 --> 00:33:58,400
He hands off to Riggins.

879
00:33:58,508 --> 00:34:00,601
He's got the first down.
Oh, he's got more!

880
00:34:00,616 --> 00:34:02,323
Oh, my!

881
00:34:02,397 --> 00:34:04,623
Riggins went down hard.

882
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:07,252
I think Tim Riggins thought he
was gonna carry that ball

883
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:08,901
all the way to Mexico.

884
00:34:09,238 --> 00:34:10,813
We have got ourselves

885
00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:12,373
a mud bowl here, folks.

886
00:34:12,616 --> 00:34:15,033
And this crowd is lovin' it.
And you know what?

887
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,332
So am I!

888
00:34:17,427 --> 00:34:18,841
Under a minute to go
in the half.

889
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:19,580
Hut!

890
00:34:19,635 --> 00:34:20,992
Saracen takes the snap.

891
00:34:21,577 --> 00:34:23,123
It's a hand-off to Williams
up the middle.

892
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:25,112
No! It's a great play
by Saracen.

893
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:26,403
He drops back.

894
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:27,551
He goes up high.

895
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,830
Oh, he lays off a beautiful
pass to Smash Williams.

896
00:34:31,048 --> 00:34:31,923
He's got it now!

897
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:34,061
He's near mid-field,
best I can tell!

898
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:35,700
- Put him down! Somebody put him down!
- Inside the 40!

899
00:34:35,726 --> 00:34:37,033
Looks like he could go!

900
00:34:37,037 --> 00:34:37,930
There you go, baby!

901
00:34:37,986 --> 00:34:40,461
Smash Williams to the ten.
He gets hit hard.

902
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:44,601
A touchdown!
Touchdown, Panthers.

903
00:34:44,636 --> 00:34:47,023
And Matt Saracen,
despite the mud

904
00:34:47,105 --> 00:34:48,952
and the rain,
has really stepped up

905
00:34:48,997 --> 00:34:51,240
and taken charge of
this Panthers' offense.

906
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:53,031
Taylor
trying to tie this thing up.

907
00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:54,012
Going for two.

908
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,900
And we have a tie, folks!

909
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:01,241
Panthers score!

910
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:04,842
And Coach Taylor has brought
this game to even going into the half.

911
00:35:05,108 --> 00:35:06,232
Coaches!
I need coaches!

912
00:35:06,257 --> 00:35:08,410
The referee is calling
for coaches and the captains.

913
00:35:08,627 --> 00:35:09,820
This could not
be good, folks.

914
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:11,571
I don't think
we oughta play.

915
00:35:11,796 --> 00:35:14,321
Hey, it'd be a real shame
if they had to call this match.

916
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:17,831
This is a home field in
the truest sense of the word.

917
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:21,630
This field was hand-built
by Coach Taylor and these players

918
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,593
so that these Dillon
fans in this town

919
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:25,031
could enjoy one last
home game.

920
00:35:25,086 --> 00:35:26,701
Coach, Coach,
we wanna play.

921
00:35:28,218 --> 00:35:29,320
Yeah, we wanna play too.

922
00:35:32,718 --> 00:35:34,152
Okay, you guys wanna play.

923
00:35:34,238 --> 00:35:36,462
In 24 minutes,
somebody's going to State.

924
00:35:37,195 --> 00:35:38,410
You're damn right
we'll play.

925
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:39,162
Let's do it, Coach.

926
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:40,083
We're playing?

927
00:35:40,135 --> 00:35:40,753
Let's play.

928
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,230
Yes! We got
what we wanted,

929
00:35:42,235 --> 00:35:44,140
and we are gonna
play this game out.

930
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:46,041
Somebody on this field tonight

931
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:47,471
is going to State.

932
00:36:00,456 --> 00:36:01,503
What, is he not coming?

933
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:02,713
Yeah, it looks that way.

934
00:36:04,505 --> 00:36:06,070
Drive safe out there.
It's pourin'.

935
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:07,270
Thanks.

936
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:08,571
Appreciate it.

937
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:12,723
The Dillon Panthers make a big
defensive stop here, folks.

938
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:14,791
This game is
still tied up at eight.

939
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:16,640
The Vikings line up
for a field goal.

940
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,100
This could put the game
out of reach.

941
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:18,972
There's the snap.

942
00:36:19,455 --> 00:36:21,270
The Brant field--oh!
He goes down.

943
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:23,582
He goes down,
and the kick is no good.

944
00:36:23,756 --> 00:36:27,682
Coach Taylor is gonna have one more shot
to bring his Panthers back.

945
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:31,043
Hey.

946
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:32,181
Forgot your notebook.

947
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,091
Do not scream!

948
00:36:37,118 --> 00:36:38,243
Do not scream!

949
00:36:39,737 --> 00:36:40,602
Get in the truck!

950
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:41,641
Get in the truck!

951
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:44,701
You're gonna like this.

952
00:36:44,776 --> 00:36:45,982
Huh? Huh?

953
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:47,901
- You're gonna like this.
- No!

954
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:51,002
I'm gonna take my time
with you.

955
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:53,753
You're gonna like this.
Stop...

956
00:36:53,877 --> 00:36:54,711
screaming!

957
00:36:57,305 --> 00:37:00,111
Everything that has been
asked of you this year

958
00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:02,511
and that you have asked
of yourselves, gentlemen,

959
00:37:02,537 --> 00:37:03,773
comes down to this.

960
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:05,232
Blood, sweat, and tears,

961
00:37:05,248 --> 00:37:08,862
it all stays right here
on this field right now!

962
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:10,312
This is our dirt.

963
00:37:10,508 --> 00:37:13,090
This is our mud.
This is ours, baby.

964
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:14,551
Clear eyes, full hearts,

965
00:37:14,596 --> 00:37:16,581
- can't lose!
- Can't lose!

966
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:17,433
Stop screaming

967
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:19,572
Stop screaming right now!

968
00:37:20,886 --> 00:37:22,631
Ah, you bitch!

969
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:40,982
Don't let them breathe.

970
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:42,973
Do not let them breathe.
Take it down the field.

971
00:37:43,037 --> 00:37:43,960
Go get it, baby, go!

972
00:37:46,488 --> 00:37:47,730
Saracen rolls right.

973
00:37:47,828 --> 00:37:49,773
He's got Smash breaking
on the skinny post.

974
00:37:50,096 --> 00:37:52,722
Oh! Smash has the ball!
He breaks to the inside.

975
00:37:52,758 --> 00:37:53,843
He's got some room.

976
00:37:54,468 --> 00:37:56,041
He's to the 40! Oh!

977
00:37:56,045 --> 00:37:58,171
You gotta get
out of bounds, Smash!

978
00:37:58,247 --> 00:37:59,793
Come on, baby, go!

979
00:37:59,837 --> 00:38:01,343
Smash is not gonna
get out of bounds.

980
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:03,131
Oh, down he goes.
Mercy!

981
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:06,001
The clock is winding down
on the Panther season.

982
00:38:11,617 --> 00:38:14,502
Tyra, I'm so sorry.
My car wouldn't--

983
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,881
what are you doin' out here?

984
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:17,733
What are you doin' out here?

985
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:19,623
He tried to rape me.

986
00:38:20,778 --> 00:38:21,582
Wait, who? Huh?

987
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:27,940
19 seconds left on the clock.

988
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,852
- This is it.
- Clock's rollin'!

989
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:32,142
Matt Saracen bringing his team
to the line of scrimmage.

990
00:38:32,388 --> 00:38:34,213
Saracen trying to set up
for a spike ball

991
00:38:34,236 --> 00:38:35,251
so he can stop the clock.

992
00:38:35,317 --> 00:38:36,163
Very smart.

993
00:38:36,408 --> 00:38:38,670
He's really showing a lot of poise
here in the clutches.

994
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,113
Go!

995
00:38:41,246 --> 00:38:42,353
Saracen over the ball.

996
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:43,903
There's the snap.

997
00:38:44,018 --> 00:38:45,440
He's gonna spike it.

998
00:38:45,518 --> 00:38:46,871
- Spike the ball!
- Let him go, let him go.

999
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,353
Wait a second,
wait a second.

1000
00:38:48,355 --> 00:38:49,221
He's keeping the ball.

1001
00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:51,632
He's hauling out.
Saracen has the ball!

1002
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:57,420
Oh! He gets a huge block
from Tim Riggins.

1003
00:38:57,547 --> 00:38:58,883
Go, go, go, go!

1004
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:07,130
Touchdown!
Touchdown, Dillon Panthers!

1005
00:39:07,195 --> 00:39:09,222
And folks, Matt Saracen

1006
00:39:09,236 --> 00:39:11,380
has really shined tonight.

1007
00:39:11,395 --> 00:39:12,710
He has stepped up

1008
00:39:12,757 --> 00:39:15,193
and led these Panthers back.

1009
00:39:15,507 --> 00:39:19,762
Our Dillon Panthers
are going to State!

1010
00:39:38,718 --> 00:39:39,540
Lord,

1011
00:39:39,597 --> 00:39:40,982
we just thank you
for the privilege

1012
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,991
of playing this game
that we love, Father.

1013
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:46,013
And to play true, God.
Tonight, in spite of the

1014
00:39:46,307 --> 00:39:48,062
rain and the cold,

1015
00:39:48,248 --> 00:39:52,452
you just allowed us to play
with honor, pride, and heart.

1016
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:56,172
Lord, help us to press on forward
knowing that no matter what,

1017
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:58,223
our destiny and our future

1018
00:39:58,637 --> 00:40:00,423
is secure in your hands, God.

1019
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:03,662
It's in the mighty and matchless
name of Jesus that we pray, Lord.

1020
00:40:03,996 --> 00:40:04,670
Amen.

1021
00:40:04,827 --> 00:40:05,600
Amen.

1022
00:40:05,745 --> 00:40:06,402
Here we go!

1023
00:40:07,378 --> 00:40:08,712
We're going to State, baby!

1024
00:40:21,677 --> 00:40:23,710
I'll always love you,
no matter what happens.

1025
00:40:33,148 --> 00:40:33,752
What?

1026
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:34,452
Great game.

1027
00:40:40,055 --> 00:40:41,863
Hey, Ma, we're goin'
to State, baby!

1028
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:44,290
We're goin' to State, Ma!

1029
00:40:46,717 --> 00:40:48,332
- I'll get you wet.
- No! Don't!

1030
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:50,403
I will stomp you.

1031
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:51,793
I will stomp you.

1032
00:40:51,918 --> 00:40:53,272
Goin' to State!

1033
00:40:53,298 --> 00:40:54,640
- Yes we are.
- Yeah.

1034
00:40:54,968 --> 00:40:56,563
Are you sleeping
over again tonight?

1035
00:40:57,948 --> 00:40:58,840
Uh...

1036
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:01,953
I know we're goin'
to State.

1037
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:30,092
You'll be all right.

1038
00:41:41,968 --> 00:41:43,331
West Cambria won tonight.

1039
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:45,303
Looks like we got
Voodoo in the final.

1040
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:49,000
- Go figure.
- Yeah.

1041
00:41:57,796 --> 00:41:59,350
Matt Saracen,
he was a--

1042
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:02,413
he was a different
quarterback tonight.

1043
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:05,633
That's a good job.

1044
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:06,682
He's a good kid.

1045
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:08,222
He's a hell
of a quarterback.

1046
00:42:08,327 --> 00:42:09,290
That was a good job.

1047
00:42:18,255 --> 00:42:19,571
You ever think about coaching?
