1
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:12,762
I've been trying to get my mom
to check into a rehab center.

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,363
- How much?
- Four grand.

3
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,866
- Son, I just don't have it.
- I got you, man.

4
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:20,002
- The bill will be $4,000.
- There you go.

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,953
Your father told me what's happened.

6
00:00:22,078 --> 00:00:24,540
It's okay, Luke.
We'll figure out what to do.

7
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:26,942
So I woke up this morning
and I'm still pregnant.

8
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:30,003
Give me your hand.
Trust me for once.

9
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:32,740
- Everything all right?
- I need your help.

10
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:34,350
A local adoption agency...

11
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:36,185
What if I don't want
to have the baby?

12
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:38,220
I can direct you to literature

13
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:39,388
for that.

14
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:41,123
But you need to talk to your mom.

15
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:47,511
And we're back at 1040 a-m,
El Fuego!

16
00:00:47,636 --> 00:00:49,565
And we got a caller on the line

17
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:51,834
at Lions' pride radio

18
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:55,371
with El Ray De La Silva,
Coach Eric Taylor.

19
00:00:55,778 --> 00:00:56,971
What do you got, caller?

20
00:00:57,096 --> 00:01:01,100
<i>I'd like to ask coach Taylor what he
plans on doing to shut down J.D. McCoy.</i>

21
00:01:02,774 --> 00:01:04,329
Well, to tell you the truth,

22
00:01:04,454 --> 00:01:07,360
we're gonna be well-prepared for the
Panthers, but that game is two weeks out

23
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:10,019
and right now we're focusing on
friday's game. Thank you for the call.

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,890
But, coach, just between you and me and
those thousands of listeners out there,

25
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:18,093
what will you do next week to combat

26
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:20,922
that Panthers' passing attack?
How will you do it?

27
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,067
Well, Buddy, what we're gonna do
is we're gonna face the Panthers

28
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:27,603
just like any other team.
But now we've got the Wescott game

29
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:30,039
and that's the game
I'm thinking about

30
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:33,199
and that's the game that I'd like
my players to be thinking about.

31
00:01:33,515 --> 00:01:36,345
And that's what we'll be
thinking about here at El Fuego,

32
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,714
the Wescott game.
Uh, yeah, coach...

33
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:41,452
We're about to lose coach Taylor,
so call in right now.

34
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:43,953
El Fuego 1040 a-m.

35
00:01:45,177 --> 00:01:46,755
I just filled this last week.

36
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,241
I lost 'em.

37
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,790
- You lost 'em?
- Yeah.

38
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:53,567
Well, I'm not filling it again, son.

39
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:57,066
I got a huge game coming up.
I need these.

40
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:59,537
Look, do I need to call
somebody like your...

41
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,403
Like your coach or your parents?

42
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:03,272
No.

43
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,074
You wanna tell
what's happening then?

44
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:06,780
I lost them, I'll find them.

45
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:08,555
Thank you, I'll look...

46
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:41,968
There was just something
about building that house

47
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:44,182
that was just so hands-on
and rewarding.

48
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:46,942
- Little addicting, huh?
- Yeah, a little bit.

49
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,353
I would love to do more.

50
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:52,287
I just keep thinking about that family
and how happy they were to move in.

51
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:55,691
Going through a training program is
quite a commitment. It's a lotta work.

52
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:58,193
Are you able to make
that kind of commitment?

53
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,162
We'd be training you
to be a team leader.

54
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:01,839
Yeah, definitely.

55
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:03,806
Now you're 17, right?

56
00:03:05,714 --> 00:03:07,269
So we'll need a parental consent.

57
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,121
Is that gonna be a problem?

58
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,541
- Not at all.
- Good, good.

59
00:03:23,308 --> 00:03:25,821
- Are you Becky Sproles?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:28,724
I'm Margaret Cafferty.
Luke's mom.

61
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,526
I know it's probably odd,

62
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:33,350
me being here like this,

63
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:36,198
but I just really wanted
to come over and meet you.

64
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:38,960
You know, extend a hand,

65
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,971
tell you that I'm really sorry
about what you've had to go through...

66
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:45,035
and to tell you

67
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,510
that I wish I could have been there
for you to help you.

68
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:50,971
Thank you.

69
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,857
Do you have maybe a few minutes

70
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:57,486
to talk to me and tell me
about what happened?

71
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,679
I mean, just to help me
understand better.

72
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,408
Yeah...

73
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,161
Come on in.

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,805
Thanks.

75
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,868
Sit, look simple if you want to.
You know I'm telling the truth.

76
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:15,946
All I'm saying is
you better have your game plan tight

77
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:18,240
or you gon' get your asses kicked
in that Panthers' game.

78
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:20,008
Yeah, okay.

79
00:04:20,255 --> 00:04:23,166
- Yo, which one is it though, man?
- Yo, that's it right here.

80
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,546
Pull up right here.

81
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:27,015
Let's go collect, gentlemen.

82
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:29,484
Get the car ready.

83
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:41,351
That's not how you do business.

84
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:43,854
You think I'm cutting up
all these cars for charity?

85
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,067
Oh, hell no.
You got your parts.

86
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:47,485
I get my money.

87
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:50,637
You got 24 hours
or it's gon' get ugly.

88
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:11,426
What the hell was that in there, man?
You buy a ticket so you can just watch?

89
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:13,218
You supposed to help!

90
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:15,480
You an idiot, junior.

91
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:18,133
How long am I supposed to do this
till we're even, till we're square?

92
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:19,880
Yo, rehab ain't cheap, man.

93
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:21,636
I'll let you know.
Get in the car!

94
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,715
- What happened in there, man?
- Let's go!

95
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:29,838
<i>What will you do next week</i>

96
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:33,014
<i>to combat that Panthers' passing attack?
How will you do it?</i>

97
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:37,256
<i>What we're gonna do is we're gonna face
the Panthers like any other team,</i>

98
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:40,093
<i>but right now the game on the table
is the Wescott game,</i>

99
00:05:40,218 --> 00:05:41,523
<i>so what we're trying to do</i>

100
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:44,933
<i>is to focus on the Wescott game.
That's the game I'm thinking about</i>

101
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:48,244
<i>and that's the game that I'd like
my players to be thinking about.</i>

102
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:51,199
<i>And that's what we'll be
thinking about here</i>

103
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:52,766
<i>at El Fuego...</i>

104
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:54,457
<i>on your a.m. dial.</i>

105
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,889

108
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:48,026
Your focus has gotta be on today.

109
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:50,525
Your focus has got to be
on practice this week.

110
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,900
Your focus has got to be on friday.

111
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,362
Nothing else.

112
00:06:54,803 --> 00:06:56,798
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir!

113
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:59,586
'Cause I guarantee you
Wescott's focus

114
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,970
is gonna be coming down here

115
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:03,690
and kicking our asses

116
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:05,673
- and it's not gonna happen.
- Yes, sir!

117
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,876
Let's go have a good practice.
Let's go.

118
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:26,427
- You all right?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:28,063
I'm good.
I'm good. Yeah.

120
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:30,762
- You sure you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

121
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:37,338
- You good? You all right?
- Yep.

122
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,675
- Hey, coach, let's give 'em five.
- All right, water!

123
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:42,610
Let's go! Jog it off!
Water! Let's go!

124
00:08:07,676 --> 00:08:08,703
Oh, my God!

125
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,864
We don't normally take

126
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,777
cash deposits, but what did you...
Did you rob a bank?

127
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:18,279
You're not gonna tell anyone,
are you?

128
00:08:20,423 --> 00:08:22,950
- I'm just kidding. I didn't rob a bank.
- Yeah, okay.

129
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:26,610
Well, I tell you what.
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna...

130
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:29,590
I'm gonna submit your offer
and I'll let you know as soon

131
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,358
- as I hear.
- Great.

132
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:33,628
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Okay...

133
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:34,864
See ya.

134
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:40,896
Luke Cafferty's mother is
trying to get you fired.

135
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:42,218
Why?

136
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:45,051
- Because he got transferred?
- No, no.

137
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:47,808
Because apparently
you instructed a girl who was

138
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:51,993
carrying her grandchild, at least
in her words, to have an abortion.

139
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,248
What?

140
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:55,750
Did this happen?

141
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,666
I had a conversation with the girl,

142
00:08:59,969 --> 00:09:03,124
but I never instructed anyone
to do anything.

143
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,758
What did you say exactly?

144
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:08,044
Well, Paul, you know that
that conversation is confidential,

145
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:09,979
but listen, this girl came to me,

146
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:13,147
she sought me out,
it was not on school grounds...

147
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:15,737
She's not even one of my students
and I followed protocol.

148
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,839
There's going to be a hearing
with you and the board.

149
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:22,643
- On what grounds?
- The fact is this is a hot-button issue

150
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:25,680
and we have a parent who's willing
to say or do anything to be heard.

151
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:27,681
You know there're
certain people on the board

152
00:09:27,806 --> 00:09:29,950
who have very strong feelings
about this, Tami.

153
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:33,371
This has turned into
a very serious situation.

154
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,958
I mean, well, you know,
how much do they know about me?

155
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,527
Like, do your parents
know I'm black?

156
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:41,662
Why does that even matter?

157
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,921
I just... I know it sounds silly,
but I just ask because

158
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:48,536
I'd like to know what I'm walking into
with these kind of situations, you know?

159
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:52,640
Well, I can tell you you're walking
into some very hit-or-miss cooking.

160
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:55,538
I think my mom said beef stroganoff.

161
00:09:57,903 --> 00:09:59,719
I don't know.
Two parents...

162
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:02,316
that really like seeing
their son happy

163
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,419
and want to see
what he's been so happy about.

164
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:07,254
You've been happy lately?

165
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:21,335
What?

166
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,980
Let's not get too...

167
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:27,007
happy in the hallway.

168
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:29,029
Gotcha.

169
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:30,444
Okay.

170
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:44,964
Here.
I got you.

171
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:47,670
- Thanks, appreciate it.
- Yeah, absolutely.

172
00:10:48,383 --> 00:10:50,527
- You got it? All right.
- Here, I got you.

173
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:52,152
You're taking these.

174
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:53,868
Thanks.

175
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:58,028
- There you go.
- You know what?

176
00:10:58,878 --> 00:11:00,608
- What?
- You're all right, Tim.

177
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:04,780
When I picked you up in that bar,
I had no idea what a good guy you are.

178
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:08,482
You've really been there for me
and you been there for my girl

179
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:11,906
and it's kind of rare,
especially in men,

180
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:13,408
so thanks.

181
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:15,253
You're like part of the family.

182
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:16,991
I really appreciate it.

183
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:18,884
Well, thank you and...

184
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:20,894
you're very welcome.

185
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:22,627
You're okay.

186
00:11:24,094 --> 00:11:25,503
Hey, uh, you know what?

187
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:27,835
I'm kind of in the mood
to celebrate tonight.

188
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:29,570
- Oh, yeah?
- So how about my treat,

189
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:32,272
take you and Becks
out tonight to dinner?

190
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,309
You kidding me? I'd love that.
I don't have to cook.

191
00:11:35,757 --> 00:11:36,830
6:00 o'clock.

192
00:11:36,955 --> 00:11:38,145
- 6:00, uh?
- Be ready!

193
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:39,506
I will.

194
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:46,334
What exactly is it
that happened then?

195
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,050
What happened is
I followed protocol.

196
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:51,291
I did what I am licensed to do,
what I'm supposed to do.

197
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:54,266
I think the question here is
what are they saying happened.

198
00:11:54,391 --> 00:11:56,480
Well, what did they say happened?

199
00:11:56,605 --> 00:12:00,434
You know what they said happened.
That I advised her to have an abortion.

200
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:03,324
Well, I don't understand
why they'd say that.

201
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:06,301
- I mean, that doesn't make sense.
- I know it doesn't make sense.

202
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,588
That's the thing
that's so crazy about it.

203
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:12,191
Especially since that girl's mother
took her to get the abortion.

204
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,548
Hey, hon.

205
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:17,518
You want to do me a big favor tonight?
Could you put your sister to bed for me?

206
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:21,188
Thank you.

207
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:22,823
Are you guys okay?

208
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:26,326
Yep.
Well, bye.

209
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,760
- Good night.
- Night.

210
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:39,072
Look, they've got butterflies on them.
That makes them exciting.

211
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:42,009
- Hey, you want to go to bed?
- No.

212
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:06,667
Hello?

213
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,592
Hey, Julie...

214
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:13,235
How you been?

215
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:20,271
I can't talk to you right now.

216
00:13:38,838 --> 00:13:41,988
My three little brothers
are still at that cute age.

217
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:44,271
They're ten, eight, and seven.

218
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:46,206
My goodness.

219
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:48,403
Your mama must have been busy.

220
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:50,077
Yeah.

221
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,117
Now what do you think
about Obama so far, Jess?

222
00:14:02,227 --> 00:14:03,827
I think he's a good...

223
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:05,956
President.
He's a good president.

224
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:07,894
Excellent.
Well, I'd have to agree.

225
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,830
Yeah.

226
00:14:12,648 --> 00:14:13,798
This is good.

227
00:14:13,923 --> 00:14:16,570
I love this brown sauce too.
It's good.

228
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:24,047
All right. Hadn't sunk in
even for me, so buckle up.

229
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:25,178
All right.

230
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:26,813
Right now,

231
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:28,916
you're looking at a proud owner

232
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:31,251
of a little piece of Texas.

233
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,588
You're a landowner?
Congratulations!

234
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:35,808
Oh, my god!

235
00:14:36,955 --> 00:14:39,655
- Wait. Where'd you get the money?
- Becky!

236
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,596
Garrity Motors threw us some work.

237
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:46,165
- Really?
- Yeah, he's been great.

238
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:49,636
- That's terrific.
- I know, it's pretty surreal.

239
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:51,938
What are you gonna
do with all of your land?

240
00:14:52,106 --> 00:14:54,140
I mean, obviously I'm gonna
build a house on it.

241
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:57,711
- With your own hands?
- Yes. I mean, for sure, of course.

242
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:02,315
Maybe after I get some more funds
together, but all in due time.

243
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:05,467
Maybe Garrity Motors
will send more your way.

244
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,054
That'd be fantastic.

245
00:15:08,363 --> 00:15:10,790
Also gonna enroll
in this tech school here.

246
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,126
You know, just for Riggins' Rigs
to keep up the pace

247
00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:15,495
with everyone else.
I mean, it's kind of a no-brainer,

248
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,664
so I'll be here a bit longer.

249
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:21,234
Then we win, 'cause we get to have you
in our backyard a little bit longer.

250
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:23,136
All right.

251
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:49,996
- Good night, honey. I love you.
- I love you too.

252
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:53,241
- Don't forget to say your prayers.
- Yes, ma'am.

253
00:15:54,147 --> 00:15:55,197
Good night.

254
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:03,018
Dear Lord, please let me get
some more drugs before Friday.

255
00:16:11,914 --> 00:16:12,914
Hey, hon'.

256
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:15,955
Yeah, I was gonna go watch tv,

257
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:17,573
but dad's in there.

258
00:16:28,411 --> 00:16:30,570
So are you gonna tell me
what's going on?

259
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:37,944
Apparently, there's somebody at
the school who's trying to get me fired.

260
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,980
I gave counsel to a girl in need

261
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:43,050
and it's got some people upset.

262
00:16:44,354 --> 00:16:46,152
So can they really fire you?

263
00:16:50,953 --> 00:16:53,301
Don't you worry.
It's gonna be okay.

264
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:09,863
- What's up?
- Can I come in?

265
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:12,745
Yeah, of course you can.

266
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:14,295
Come on in.

267
00:17:16,872 --> 00:17:18,721
Welcome to the humble...

268
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:24,979
I don't...

269
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,843
I know I said I wasn't gonna be knocking
on your door in the middle of the night,

270
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,722
but that was a pretty great dinner.

271
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,071
This isn't a good idea.
I can't do this.

272
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:35,196
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:39,433
It's not just about sex.
I know we've done that.

274
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,714
And I just feel like
we should get to know each other.

275
00:17:42,969 --> 00:17:43,776
I mean,

276
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:45,568
I'm a pretty great girl

277
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:47,590
and you're a pretty great guy and...

278
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,717
we barely know each other
and we're living just a few meters away,

279
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:54,720
and I think it would be a shame
if we didn't, like,

280
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:56,358
date or,

281
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,666
hang out like normal people.

282
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,227
- Cheryl, listen to me.
- What?

283
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:02,662
Just listen for one second.

284
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,381
I think you're a great person
and I will never forget what you've done

285
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:08,262
to help me with the trailer

286
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,002
and I respect you enormously

287
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:12,438
and Becky as well, but just...

288
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:13,873
I respect you too.

289
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,711
I'm not the right guy for you and
you need to believe me when I say that.

290
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,397
I'm not ready to have or be
in a relationship with someone

291
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:25,685
- that already has a family and I...
- Doesn't have to be a relationship.

292
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,520
You don't have to worry about...

293
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:29,689
I'm sorry.
This isn't gonna happen.

294
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:35,527
All right.

295
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:38,197
Well, I just, you know,

296
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:41,667
I thought it would be kind of silly
if I never said anything, you know?

297
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:43,819
So just in case.

298
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:46,740
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be, please.

299
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:47,673
I'm drunk.

300
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:53,667
- Thanks for dinner, by the way.
- You too.

301
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:08,027
How's it going?

302
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:09,195
It's good.

303
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,463
How's your mom?

304
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:11,778
How's my mom?

305
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:15,801
She came by my house the other day,
you know, to talk about

306
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:17,636
everything that was going on,

307
00:19:17,804 --> 00:19:20,254
so I think
she just kind of left upset.

308
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:24,643
She shouldn't have done that.
I'm so sorry.

309
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:26,491
It's really okay.
We had a good talk.

310
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:29,095
No, I'm sorry, okay?

311
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:32,202
That won't ever happen again, okay?

312
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:33,983
Sorry.

313
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:40,126
You should have advised her
to seek counseling.

314
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:43,662
Well, she came to me for counsel
and I gave her her options.

315
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,455
And you felt it appropriate
to take on that role?

316
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:49,262
Miss Jackson,
do you know what my role is?

317
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:51,937
I am a certified counselor
and principal.

318
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:54,673
I followed protocol
according to district policy.

319
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:57,347
And you found it appropriate
to impose your values

320
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:59,848
on an innocent,
16-year-old, confused girl?

321
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:01,513

I did not impose my values.

322
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:03,949
You referred her
to an abortion clinic.

323
00:20:04,117 --> 00:20:06,485
I did not refer her
to an abortion clinic.

324
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:08,153
She went there with her mother.

325
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:10,606
You provided this girl
who was not your student,

326
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:12,249
who is not zoned in your school

327
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:14,627
with the information
to get her child aborted.

328
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:17,363
- I did not, ma'am.
- Are you calling me a liar?

329
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:19,597
No, I'm telling you
you have bad information.

330
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:21,467
Let's please just calm down.

331
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:25,204
We're here because a parent complained
that an educator from our district

332
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:27,456
inappropriately advised a girl.

333
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:29,137
That is all this is about.

334
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,976
- I agree, Tom.
- Fine.

335
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:32,556
Mrs. Taylor,

336
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:36,715
did you or did you not advise
this girl to get an abortion?

337
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:39,184
I did not advise her
to get an abortion, no.

338
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:41,836
This girl came to me.
She was scared.

339
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:45,391
She was desperate for an adult
to listen to her. I gave her options

340
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:47,726
and I listened.
That was my responsibility to her

341
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:50,194
as a principal and as a human being.

342
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,224
I hope you'll keep that in mind
as you make your decision.

343
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:55,134
Thank you.
I know you'll let me know.

344
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:09,148
They just say things sometimes.

345
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:12,618
I mean, I don't know though.
Obama? Really?

346
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:15,888
She turned a little red
when she talked about him.

347
00:21:16,662 --> 00:21:18,612
I had a good time last night.

348
00:21:19,197 --> 00:21:20,197
Me too.

349
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:22,828
I sure didn't see you coming.

350
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:25,326
I know.
That's why you hit me with this car.

351
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,932
That's not what I meant.

352
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:29,067
I know what you meant.

353
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:31,603
I didn't see you coming either.

354
00:21:44,684 --> 00:21:47,645
I'm sorry honey, but you have to.
This is time for nap.

355
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,930
You need to.
You're exhausted.

356
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:53,492
Five to one in your favor.

357
00:21:55,126 --> 00:21:56,161
Really, Paul?

358
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:58,964
Thank you.

359
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:00,536
You're welcome.

360
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:04,036
It's over. I just don't want this
to get outside of the board.

361
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:07,807
This is the kind of thing that,
some parents could go nuts about

362
00:22:07,932 --> 00:22:09,641
if they hear it out of context.

363
00:22:09,904 --> 00:22:13,215
<i>I have no reason to think
that's gonna happen. Just be careful.</i>

364
00:22:13,472 --> 00:22:15,591
<i>I want to protect you
as much as possible.</i>

365
00:22:15,716 --> 00:22:17,449
Well, I appreciate you, Paul.

366
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,884
You're welcome.

367
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:20,222
Thank you.

368
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:33,732
So I'm gonna need you Friday night.

369
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:36,335
You know I play football
Friday nights.

370
00:22:36,503 --> 00:22:40,005
Let me just call this son-of-a-bitch
and tell him you got a game.

371
00:22:45,987 --> 00:22:47,212
Okay, I'll be there.

372
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:49,247
I'll get you after your game.

373
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:50,751
Just be ready.

374
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:55,854
I don't know why you bother
even talking to that guy.

375
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,525
I'm just doing some extra work
for him at the shop.

376
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,095
Help pay for your mom?

377
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:09,144
She okay?

378
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:14,176
I don't know.

379
00:23:18,044 --> 00:23:20,440
The school board votes
and that's it?

380
00:23:21,614 --> 00:23:24,064
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

381
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:26,084
Who was that?
Who you talking to?

382
00:23:26,252 --> 00:23:28,143
I just got off the phone
with the school board.

383
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:30,171
Mom, this needs to stop, okay?

384
00:23:30,296 --> 00:23:32,168
You should not have gone
over to talk to Becky.

385
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:34,426
I wish... Will you please
just let this go?

386
00:23:34,843 --> 00:23:37,340
A woman who would do
something like that

387
00:23:37,465 --> 00:23:39,364
should not be in charge of children.

388
00:23:39,677 --> 00:23:41,186
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

389
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:43,368
Principal Taylor,
she didn't do anything here.

390
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:46,404
I'm the one who got Becky pregnant,

391
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:48,773
so why are you blaming coach's wife?

392
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:49,975
Coach Taylor,

393
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:52,143
football!
Is that all you care about?

394
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,584
That was your child.

395
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:58,984
That was my grandchild.

396
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:04,217
Mom, I'm sorry, okay?

397
00:24:05,668 --> 00:24:09,021
But Principal Taylor didn't do anything
wrong and it's not gonna help

398
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:11,187
by you trying
to take her down for this.

399
00:24:11,312 --> 00:24:14,138
But she cannot do
something like that.

400
00:24:15,632 --> 00:24:17,714
Do not walk out on me, Luke!

401
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:35,266
Oh, I'm tired.

402
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:37,489
I got some good news today.

403
00:24:37,753 --> 00:24:38,757
What's that?

404
00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:41,806
The board decided to keep me
as principal.

405
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,297
How you feel about that?

406
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:49,615
I feel kind of heartbroken
that it happened, but...

407
00:24:49,784 --> 00:24:51,970
I guess I'm glad to have my job.

408
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:02,347
What you doing tonight?

409
00:25:02,852 --> 00:25:03,852
Nothing.

410
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:06,067
I'll go get the wine.

411
00:25:27,143 --> 00:25:28,907
Do you know
where I can get some oxycontin?

412
00:25:29,075 --> 00:25:30,886
I don't know what you talking about.

413
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:33,978
Dude, I'm not a narc.
I just really need some painkillers.

414
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:35,213
I got money, dude.

415
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:39,082
Dude, I don't care who you is.
Raise up out my park, man.

416
00:25:40,115 --> 00:25:41,265
Okay, thanks.

417
00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:53,431
I'm hungry.
Let's get something to eat.

418
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,824
Come on. Let's go.

419
00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:56,658
All right, little brother.
Let's roll.

420
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:00,939
Hey, Eric.

421
00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:03,908
- Hey, Buddy. How you doing?
- Good.

422
00:26:04,253 --> 00:26:05,443
What you doing out here?

423
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:08,155
You notice anything
different about me?

424
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:10,581
You got a new belt.

425
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:13,712
Took the ring off.

426
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,225
Panther ring.

427
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:17,513
48 hours.

428
00:26:17,638 --> 00:26:19,704
I just wanted to see
if I could stand it.

429
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:21,392
You know what?

430
00:26:21,742 --> 00:26:23,061
I can stand it.

431
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:24,988
And I love the old Panthers.

432
00:26:25,113 --> 00:26:26,786
I don't love the new Panthers.

433
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:30,435
But I cannot wait for that game.

434
00:26:30,603 --> 00:26:32,036
It's gonna be a good one.

435
00:26:32,352 --> 00:26:35,582
What do you think
our real chances are?

436
00:26:36,632 --> 00:26:38,102
I've got a kickoff in four hours.

437
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:40,712
I don't have time to talk
about this right now.

438
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,989
You gon' be at the game tonight?

439
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:44,450
I'll see you then.

440
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:45,925
Good game, coach.

441
00:26:52,023 --> 00:26:53,591
Hey, lady.
Can I come in?

442
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:54,955
Hey, Jess.

443
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:59,096
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

444
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:00,464
How you doing?

445
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:02,266
Just...

446
00:27:02,725 --> 00:27:04,925
Vince told me you were here, so...

447
00:27:05,848 --> 00:27:08,806
I didn't know
if it was okay to come or not,

448
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:10,274
but I wanted to say hi.

449
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,398
And I wanted to tell you Vince is

450
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:18,538
really proud of what you're doing
and everything.

451
00:27:21,177 --> 00:27:22,177
Thank you.

452
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:25,421
He's a good boy, isn't he?

453
00:27:26,263 --> 00:27:27,157
He is.

454
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,482
Come here.

455
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:32,607
It's okay.

456
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:36,614
Thank you for coming.

457
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:41,572
Let's go, boy.

458
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:44,791
We about to lay
somebody on they back!

459
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:08,632
What do you want, Matt?

460
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,150
Hey, how are you?

461
00:28:13,507 --> 00:28:14,707
Are you there?

462
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:19,744
- Did you hang up?
- No, I didn't.

463
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,746
I know you're mad, all right?

464
00:28:22,582 --> 00:28:25,850
I'd be mad too, you know?
I'd be furious if that had happened.

465
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,186
Great.
Can I go now?

466
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:33,224
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm in Chicago.

467
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:34,759
I know.

468
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,364
I talked to your mom
and your grandma.

469
00:28:37,514 --> 00:28:39,547
I just got a job
at this art gallery.

470
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:41,607
I mean,
it's just entry-level stuff, but...

471
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:45,402
I don't know, it's pretty exciting.
I'm gonna start school next semester.

472
00:28:45,715 --> 00:28:47,743
<i>And I got an apartment.</i>

473
00:28:48,557 --> 00:28:51,542
That's great. Sounds like
you got it all worked out.

474
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,265
But... I don't know, it's just weird,
'cause I got everything worked out...

475
00:28:56,605 --> 00:28:58,682
It just doesn't feel right,
'cause...

476
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,585
'Cause you're not here.

477
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:07,157
Well, I'm glad
I mean something to you.

478
00:29:07,536 --> 00:29:08,536
Just...

479
00:29:09,754 --> 00:29:11,854
not enough to call me until now.

480
00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:13,681
Julie, look, I'm sorry, all right?

481
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:16,300
I just... I was really upset and...

482
00:29:16,608 --> 00:29:18,369
And how do you think that I felt?

483
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,342
No, you're right.
It's...

484
00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:22,829
With everything
that I was going through...

485
00:29:22,954 --> 00:29:25,442
Matt, we were together
for almost four years.

486
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,680
I know everything about you.

487
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:32,841
You were my other half.

488
00:29:33,323 --> 00:29:36,024
I hate you so much for leaving me.

489
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:42,674
How could you do that
to somebody that you love?

490
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:45,555
I don't know.
I just thought...

491
00:29:46,024 --> 00:29:47,965
I just felt like
that was what I had to do.

492
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:50,334
Well, I have to do
what I have to do.

493
00:29:50,602 --> 00:29:53,052
And whatever's missing
in your life...

494
00:29:54,422 --> 00:29:56,307
I suggest you go out and find it.

495
00:29:56,938 --> 00:29:59,243
Julie, don't say that, all right?

496
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:00,908
Bye, Matt.

497
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:20,557
You understand 1 tight end,
11 personnel.

498
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:22,966
Everything is off me.
We'll signal the plays

499
00:30:23,134 --> 00:30:25,447
so they'll think
that we're going no-huddle.

500
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:27,171
Just go on through the step.

501
00:30:27,296 --> 00:30:30,207
Keep that tight end on your side
and tighten your splits down, all right?

502
00:30:33,475 --> 00:30:36,046
- What's up, Tinker?
- What's going on, man?

503
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:39,504
I saw you
at Carroll Park last night.

504
00:30:41,903 --> 00:30:44,349
I was just nervous about something.
Couldn't sleep,

505
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,040
so I took a drive

506
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:48,448
and didn't feel any better.
I took a walk.

507
00:30:48,573 --> 00:30:51,228
What I heard was
you brought some cash with you.

508
00:30:53,264 --> 00:30:54,565
What's going on, man?

509
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:57,167
First five games
you talking like an announcer

510
00:30:57,587 --> 00:30:58,694
in the huddle.

511
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:01,738
Last three weeks it seems like you
been saving your breath for something.

512
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,730
Something wrong?

513
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:06,916
What's going on?
Be real with me.

514
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:09,192
All right.

515
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,654
- What is that?
- It's a bruise.

516
00:31:17,922 --> 00:31:20,457
- Why you didn't say nothing?
- Because I can play through it.

517
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,021
Why you didn't tell no one?

518
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,494
- Not a word.
- You should have speak.

519
00:31:24,662 --> 00:31:27,598
- You should have told me.
- All right. All right.

520
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:34,471
<i>Here we go, folks.
Five minutes left in the second quarter</i>

521
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:37,374
<i>and the Lions will try to claw
their way back</i>

522
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:38,976
<i>from a 7-nothing deficit.</i>

523
00:31:39,144 --> 00:31:41,612
All right.
We going 27 option left, all right?

524
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,146
- On one, ready?
- Break.

525
00:31:43,894 --> 00:31:46,444
<i>Vince Howard brings them up
to the line.</i>

526
00:31:47,217 --> 00:31:48,374
<i>There's the snap.</i>

527
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:51,655
<i>Quick pitch to Cafferty to the outside,
got a little room...</i>

528
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:54,958
Oh my! Can this kid really fly?

529
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:56,877
<i>And he steps out of bounds.</i>

530
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:58,729
What are you running
out of bounds for?

531
00:31:59,037 --> 00:32:01,352
Hey, what are you running
out of bounds for?

532
00:32:01,477 --> 00:32:03,166
Get upfield!
Let's go!

533
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:05,915
- Same play, coach.
- Same thing, right? Same thing.

534
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,170
Here!
Here we go!

535
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:10,746
Let's go!

536
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:13,243
- We cannot run that play again.
- Excuse me?

537
00:32:13,411 --> 00:32:14,745
We cannot run to that side.

538
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:17,748
- Do you have a reason?
- Luke is hurt. His side is messed up.

539
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:19,916
Every time,
he gets hit in his right side.

540
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:22,894
So you want us to do what the coach
doesn't want us to do? Great.

541
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:25,932
Luke, how bad is it?
Can you make it through this one?

542
00:32:26,057 --> 00:32:28,191
I mean,
it depends on which way we run.

543
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:30,291
You've heard the man.

544
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:33,302
All right, we going 28 option right.
28 option right.

545
00:32:33,742 --> 00:32:36,142
- You got it? On one. Ready?
- Break!

546
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:44,341
<i>Quick toss to the right. Cafferty
cuts inside, he's got a little room...</i>

547
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:45,542
What's he doing?

548
00:32:45,872 --> 00:32:47,528
<i>Another great cut.</i>

549
00:32:47,653 --> 00:32:49,687
<i>Boom! He trucks the linebacker. </i>

550
00:32:49,812 --> 00:32:52,516
<i>Another big hit
and down goes Cafferty.</i>

551
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:54,291
<i>First down Lions!</i>

552
00:32:57,689 --> 00:32:59,890
- What'd you give him?
- We called left!

553
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,560
Come here!

554
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:05,929
Did I tell you to run a sweep
to the short side? What'd you just run?

555
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:08,231
- I ran it to the short side.
- Why{\ did you do that?

556
00:33:08,565 --> 00:33:11,234
- 'Cause I got the signals mixed up.
- You got mixed up?

557
00:33:11,402 --> 00:33:14,404
Come on, son.
We've got them by the ass. Be smart.

558
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:16,106
Here we go.
Let's go, baby.

559
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:19,718
He mixed up left and right?

560
00:33:19,843 --> 00:33:21,863
He mixed up.
We didn't talk about that in practice.

561
00:33:21,988 --> 00:33:24,314
We'll have to review that,
I suppose.

562
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:25,715
Luke, I'm sorry.

563
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:29,355
We're going 27 option left.
27 option left on one.

564
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,672
- Ready?
- Break!

565
00:33:30,797 --> 00:33:33,990
<i>It's a beautiful option.
Cafferty to the left side.</i>

566
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:37,418
<i>But he gets barreled
by two linebackers!</i>

567
00:33:37,543 --> 00:33:38,778
Suck it up!
Suck it up!

568
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:40,830
<i>Cafferty is slow to get up, folks.</i>

569
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:43,658
<i>My, oh my,
he took a big hit right there.</i>

570
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:46,302
- Let's go!
- Finish that! Let's go!

571
00:33:48,005 --> 00:33:49,886
- Same play.
- Same play? It's the same thing.

572
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:51,411
We're coming left.

573
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:54,811
<i>Lines on the center.
Cafferty goes in motion.</i>

574
00:33:55,217 --> 00:33:57,480
<i>Another quick toss going left.</i>

575
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:02,852
<i>It looks like Cafferty's
hearing footsteps. And he gets pasted!</i>

576
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,950
<i>Down he goes.
Look Cafferty.</i>

577
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:06,005
<i>Oh, my.</i>

578
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,757
<i>He's hurt, folks.</i>

579
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:12,886
He's hurt. Hey, time-out.
Time-out.

580
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:15,031
<i>And coach Taylor
has to call a time-out.</i>

581
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,795
- You got it?
- Can you get up? Let's go.

582
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,771
Let's go.

583
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:25,364
<i>Cafferty's up,
but he is moving very slowly.</i>

584
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:28,445
<i>The crowd on their feet
giving this young man a little love.</i>

585
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:33,316
Man, he took one hell of a beating,
but this one tough hombre.

586
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,654
What's wrong?

587
00:34:38,585 --> 00:34:40,507
- On my hip.
- Let me see.

588
00:34:42,734 --> 00:34:44,051
You all right?

589
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:47,630
- What the hell is that?
- It's a hip flexor. He's done.

590
00:34:47,798 --> 00:34:50,700
- He's out for the season.
- How long you had that?

591
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:52,135
Four weeks.

592
00:34:52,303 --> 00:34:54,704
Four weeks!
You didn't tell anyone?

593
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:57,407
You did that four weeks ago
and you didn't tell us?

594
00:34:57,767 --> 00:35:00,491
I thought I could play through it,
coach.

595
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,479
I'm sorry, coach.

596
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:04,997
I'm sorry, coach!

597
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:19,362
I was about to watch <i>Thelma & Louise</i>.
You want to join me?

598
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:23,084
I made popcorn.

599
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,600
Where's your mom?

600
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:26,488
She has to work until 2:00.

601
00:35:29,345 --> 00:35:32,175
Yeah, I don't think
it's a good idea, Becks.

602
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:33,109
Why not?

603
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:34,625
Just isn't.

604
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:36,531
Please?

605
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,915
I don't want to be alone.

606
00:35:54,915 --> 00:35:56,899
What other movies you got?

607
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:02,071
Look, we'll just go in there,
get my money, and we get out.

608
00:36:02,756 --> 00:36:05,075
So it might get a little hot,
so I'm gonna need you to stay

609
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,130
and keep the car running
since you like to watch anyway.

610
00:36:08,255 --> 00:36:10,079
Come on.
I'm gonna need a little muscle.

611
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:11,247
Let's roll.

612
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,249
Yo, B, we'll be right back.

613
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:15,818
- Keep this thing running, all right?
- I got you.

614
00:36:41,512 --> 00:36:43,264
I think I'm moving out.

615
00:36:56,493 --> 00:36:58,961
You got to be kidding me.
I do not believe this.

616
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:01,464
- It's not what you think.
- It's exactly what I think it is.

617
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:04,667
- Get out of here.
- It's not what you think at all.

618
00:37:04,835 --> 00:37:08,704
On my bed with my daughter in the middle
of the night and it's not what I think?

619
00:37:08,872 --> 00:37:11,007
How long has this been going on?
Thank god I came home.

620
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:12,708
We were just watching a movie.

621
00:37:12,876 --> 00:37:15,034
You get out of here.
You get out!

622
00:37:15,212 --> 00:37:18,814
Get your stuff off my property now!
And you go to your room, Becky!

623
00:37:19,341 --> 00:37:20,441
You stop it!

624
00:37:20,651 --> 00:37:23,152
Shut up and go to
your room right now!

625
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,055
Go in your room!
In my bed, are you kidding me?

626
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,596
You must think
I'm some sort of an idiot, Tim,

627
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:32,785
while I go banging on your trailer door
in the middle of the night

628
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,898
when you were sleeping
with my daughter

629
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:36,533
under my nose.

630
00:37:37,316 --> 00:37:40,336
You're exactly what I thought you were
when I first met you.

631
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:42,505
You're nothing.
Just like all the guys

632
00:37:42,673 --> 00:37:44,423
I've ever met in my life.

633
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,308
Absolutely nothing.

634
00:37:47,094 --> 00:37:48,377
I can't believe this!

635
00:37:48,545 --> 00:37:51,351
I cannot believe
this has been going on this whole time!

636
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:53,048
I never touched your daughter.

637
00:37:53,216 --> 00:37:54,884
You can buy your land...

638
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:57,241
and you can do whatever you do,

639
00:37:57,366 --> 00:38:00,556
but you will never amount
to anything, ever!

640
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:02,583
Go!

641
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:05,494
I don't ever want to see you again!

642
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,700
Go!

643
00:38:22,746 --> 00:38:23,837
Get out of here!

644
00:38:23,962 --> 00:38:25,581
You gonna get our asses shot!

645
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,017
Get out of here!
Go!

646
00:38:28,185 --> 00:38:29,029
Go!

647
00:38:44,468 --> 00:38:46,438
<i>Hello. This is principal Taylor?</i>

648
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:47,605
Yes, it is.

649
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,589
<i>I'm sorry to call so late, ma'am,
I'm with the </i>Daily Gazette<i>.</i>

650
00:38:50,714 --> 00:38:52,424
<i>Would you comment on the allegations</i>

651
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:55,276
<i>that you advised a student
to get an abortion?</i>

652
00:38:57,925 --> 00:38:59,577
<i>Do you have anything to say?</i>

653
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:04,720
No comment.

654
00:39:23,763 --> 00:39:25,341
What are you doing here?

655
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:27,509
I was just...
I need to talk to you.

656
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:29,678
Your mom's gonna kill me.

657
00:39:29,846 --> 00:39:31,547
It's fine, she passed out.

658
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,713
Look, I know you're moving out.

659
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:34,722
Right.

660
00:39:35,265 --> 00:39:38,020
And I know I'm not gonna be seeing you
much anymore.

661
00:39:39,034 --> 00:39:41,623
So I wanted to tell you
that the stuff that my mom said to you,

662
00:39:42,352 --> 00:39:43,552
it's not true.

663
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:47,963
You're not a loser.

664
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:50,472
And you're not nothing.

665
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,301
You're kind,

666
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,490
and you're good, and you're strong.

667
00:39:56,942 --> 00:39:58,892
You protected me from my dad.

668
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,046
And you drove three hours
all the way to that crappy pageant.

669
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,556
I mean,
you didn't even know me then.

670
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:10,953
And you helped me

671
00:40:11,374 --> 00:40:14,606
through the hardest thing
I have ever had to go through.

672
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,077
And you were the only one there.

673
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:25,168
So I just wanted to thank you.

674
00:40:26,975 --> 00:40:27,975
For that.

675
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,656
Bye, Tim Riggins.

676
00:41:05,565 --> 00:41:07,515
I just can't believe we lost.

677
00:41:08,307 --> 00:41:09,748
This season's over.

678
00:41:09,873 --> 00:41:11,551
Luke's out.
We're done.

679
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:13,167
You did your best.

680
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,083
We gotta go, it's late.

681
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:23,422
T. Tami Taylor's gonna kill me
for keeping you out this late.

682
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:24,393
Come on.

683
00:41:25,211 --> 00:41:27,413
Sit down, let's have another drink.

684
00:41:30,826 --> 00:41:32,626
I don't wanna go home yet.

685
00:42:01,831 --> 00:42:03,331
Thanks for the ride.

686
00:42:12,642 --> 00:42:15,051
Yeah, Vince, what you doing here?

687
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:24,452
Okay, what's the matter?

688
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:27,475
Calvin's dead.
