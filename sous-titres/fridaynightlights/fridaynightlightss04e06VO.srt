1
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:05,570
I can't do this.

2
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,540
- My name's Luke.
- I know who you are.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,502
It's your dad...

4
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:13,211
He was killed.

5
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:14,887
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:17,246
Are you all right?

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:18,917
I'm fine.

8
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,153
<i>This Friday's game</i>

9
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,433
<i>between the East Dillon Lions
and the McNulty Mavericks</i>

10
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,257
<i>promises to be a barn burner,</i>

11
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:38,178
<i>At least on one side of the ball.</i>

12
00:00:38,303 --> 00:00:41,495
<i>McNulty is the favorite to upset
the Panthers' reign this year,</i>

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,443
<i>and their undefeated record
has them in prime position</i>

14
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:46,502
<i>for that playoff spot.</i>

15
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:49,284
<i>You got to wonder
how fast and how often</i>

16
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,165
<i>this McNulty offense is gonna score
on this poor Lions' defense.</i>

17
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:55,220
<i>Flip the TV on for this one...</i>

18
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,015
You hear that, man?
You one sorry, brother.

19
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,739
- You know that, Vince?
- Go ahead.

20
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:02,036
I mean, it's one thing
to be on the team that sucks.

21
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:05,247
It's a whole other thing
to be on a team that suck on TV.

22
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,675
Everybody watching too?

23
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:11,332
- Shut up.
- Couldn't be me.

24
00:01:11,457 --> 00:01:14,906
That's why I quit that sorry-ass team.
You know what I'm saying?

25
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:17,806
McNulty's averaging
53 points a game.

26
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:20,532
They got the second ranked
offense in the state.

27
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:22,882
Coach, they've only punted twice
the whole damn season.

28
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:24,583
Friday, we are gonna keep it simple.

29
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,151
These are offensive plays.

30
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:27,652
"Offensive," Stan.

31
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:29,714
- "Offensive" plays.
- Listen up now.

32
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:32,383
McNulty's undefeated.
Game's televised.

33
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:34,385
It's a game-changer.
I don't like it.

34
00:01:34,812 --> 00:01:36,390
That's what I'm talking about.

35
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:39,331
What we're gonna do
is we're gonna go down to the field

36
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,672
with the media.

37
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:43,635
We're gonna talk briefly
with the reporters.

38
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:46,004
Let's keep it simple.

39
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:50,976
I'm not finished.

40
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:02,020
Wait, wait, wait.
I totally just remembered something.

41
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,989
Oh, no. What?
You're pregnant?

42
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:05,843
You are, aren't you?

43
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:09,086
I'm having twins actually,
but they're aliens.

44
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,704
I don't want twins.

45
00:02:11,244 --> 00:02:15,116
So I bought these tickets
for the Austin Indie Music Festival,

46
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,035
and it was supposed
to be a surprise but...

47
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,929
- But then my dad died.
- Yeah.

48
00:02:19,246 --> 00:02:21,046
I can give 'em to Devin
or something.

49
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:23,208
We ought to go.

50
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,810
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

51
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:26,771
And you know what?

52
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,308
Actually someone gave me, like,
this grieving handbook thing,

53
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:31,702
and chapter two said,
"When your dad dies,

54
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:33,611
"you should most likely probably go

55
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:36,488
to a music festival,
preferably in Austin."

56
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,801
- You're such a liar.
- I'm not a liar.

57
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,413
- Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
- I'll be fine. Look, he's...

58
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:44,188
He's dead, all right?

59
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:46,116
And I'm... I'm alive.

60
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:48,490
So let's go.

61
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:54,465
Hey, guys. How you doing?
Hey, Mike. How are you?

62
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,468
What are your goals
going into this game?

63
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,805
Goals going to the game?
We'd like to stop their offense,

64
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,472
put a few holes in their defense.

65
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,378
How do you intend to measure
that success?

66
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:06,708
We're gonna use the scoreboard
to measure that success.

67
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,209
What do you hope to accomplish there?
What do you want the score to reflect?

68
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:11,590
I would like

69
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,652
for the score to reflect that we left
everything on the field that we had.

70
00:03:14,852 --> 00:03:17,914
- So you're gonna win this game?
- Well, what I'm saying is...

71
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,841
We can win and we will win.

72
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,768
- Are you guaranteeing a victory?
- I am guaranteeing a victory.

73
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,344
We got to start practice, okay?

74
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:28,874
Get these fine young men out here who
are gonna put their blood on the field!

75
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:31,812
Becky, come on...

76
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,289
Nice place.

77
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,857
It's something.

78
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:56,568
- So I saw you at the funeral.
- Yeah, I saw you too.

79
00:03:57,243 --> 00:03:58,637
Thought you'd be back by now.

80
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:00,232
Midterm break.

81
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:02,808
I stayed to see my dad.

82
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:05,277
That's nice.

83
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:08,647
"That's nice." That's it?

84
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,258
It's not nice?

85
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,438
Oh, you are something, huh?

86
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,980
You stop calling, you disappear...

87
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:22,701
That's nice.

88
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:25,435
My dad says you threw away
the scholarship.

89
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,067
I did.

90
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,633
I'm so glad I came over.

91
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:50,270
4x06: STAY

92
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,921
Subtitles: Team Lions
With the participation of:

93
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,465
Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh,
GillesSilb, Jenn, Ju, Nam, ouazo

94
00:05:36,356 --> 00:05:39,008
Mom! It's two days.
It's not a week!

95
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:40,872
It is two nights in Austin

96
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:43,149
during exams?
Absolutely not!

97
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:45,636
It's a ridiculous thing.
You haven't been accepted into college.

98
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:49,181
So if I would have gotten into college,
this would be a conversation because...

99
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,324
If you had passed your exams already and
you had gotten accepted into 3 schools

100
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:55,120
early decision then, yes,
you can go to Austin, Texas,

101
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:57,871
on two school nights
and enjoy a music show.

102
00:05:57,996 --> 00:06:00,740
Yes, I think in that situation,
I'd be all right with it.

103
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:02,694
Matt's dad just died, mom.

104
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,481
I'm not gonna dignify that
with even a response.

105
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:08,325
- Come on, Jules.
- What's going on?

106
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:11,016
Dad, can I go to the music festival
with Matt?

107
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:12,745
Hi, sweet girl.
The music festival

108
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,373
in the middle of the week
in Austin, Texas, sweetheart.

109
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,081
No, I don't think you're gonna
be going to Austin with Matt.

110
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,925
You guys are awful!

111
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,573
Look, Matt, I'm sorry.

112
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:27,271
You should be, man. You suck.
I been working with you a lot lately...

113
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:30,189
That is not what I was talking about.
I was talking about your dad, so thanks.

114
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:31,632
I know. I know.

115
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:33,232
You know they...

116
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:35,894
- They're giving us a death gratuity?
- A what?

117
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:37,541
Death gratuity?

118
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,492
Yeah, it's, like, $100,000.

119
00:06:39,812 --> 00:06:41,233
Does it come in a tip jar?

120
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:45,182
They just...
I guess they tack it on with the...

121
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:48,207
life insurance policies,
so grandma's...

122
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:51,702
- She's set up for the rest of her life.
- That's good. What about you?

123
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:55,171
What about me?

124
00:06:57,997 --> 00:06:59,285
I don't know.

125
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,919
How are you doing, I guess?

126
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,913
I'm fine, man. I don't understand
why people keep asking me how I'm doing.

127
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,924
I'm fine. People keep saying,
"Are you okay?"

128
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,660
I don't really know
what to say in this situation.

129
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,886
You don't have to say anything.
It's over with. We took care of it,

130
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:14,365
and now we're just throwing a football.
Is that okay with you?

131
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,469
I'm really start to get the feeling
that you just want to fight.

132
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,939
I don't know if you want me to give you
some kind of big speech.

133
00:07:21,787 --> 00:07:23,809
I don't know what it is
that you want me to do.

134
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,311
But I'm not gonna do that.
I don't care what you do.

135
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:29,614
But either way, I'm gonna
be your best friend,

136
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,382
'cause you've been my best
friend since we were five.

137
00:07:33,448 --> 00:07:34,748
Yeah, all right.

138
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,099
Hey, honey.

139
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,740
Hey, y'all.

140
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:43,795
- Oh, messages, messages?
- Of course. Of course.

141
00:07:44,082 --> 00:07:47,099
The PTA meeting has been changed
to Friday the 28th.

142
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:49,760
Clint wants you to meet
the new hire for AP Spanish,

143
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,886
and Mrs. Corrigan called to request
that her son be moved out of calculus.

144
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:55,540
- Her number's here.
- Okay, thank you so much.

145
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,456
And your daughter called and she said
for you not to worry about anything.

146
00:07:58,581 --> 00:07:59,928
She'd see you on Saturday.

147
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:01,438
Wait. What was that?

148
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,275
Yeah, she said...
She said she was going to Austin.

149
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,186
- She did?
- Called 15 minutes ago, maybe.

150
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,115
All right.
Could you just get that door?

151
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,791
Thank you very much.

152
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,830
Julie, this is your mother calling.
I just got the strangest message

153
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:22,624
from the secretary in the office
that you have gone to Austin,

154
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:25,796
which I know cannot be true, considering
the fact that both your father and I

155
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,074
told you that you couldn't go to Austin.
So you had best call me back right away.

156
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:30,885
Thank you very much.

157
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:39,418
Hello, stranger.

158
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:43,120
So look, I think... I think the best
thing to do here in this situation

159
00:08:43,245 --> 00:08:45,482
is just to be completely mature
about all this.

160
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:49,227
You know? And first off,
I just want to say

161
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:52,309
kissing you was great.

162
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:54,002
You know?

163
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:56,160
That was great.
You're great.

164
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,921
So just know
that bottom line, you know?

165
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:02,666
Well, you see,
there's this part of me

166
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:05,777
that's like maybe we should just kind of
see where it goes, see what happens,

167
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:09,113
not really think about it too much.
Then there's this other really, really

168
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:11,249
kind of tiny part of me

169
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,718
that's still hung up
on this other girl,

170
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:16,555
Tyra, who's, like,

171
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,516
embedded in the back of my mind.

172
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,593
So I think the mature thing...

173
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:29,763
I really didn't see that coming.

174
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:35,773
Will I see you later?

175
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:37,943
Like when?

176
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,536
Five minutes.

177
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:41,452
Maybe three.

178
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:46,985
I go back to school in three days.

179
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,214
You go back to school in three days.
See, I don't know

180
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,872
if you know this, but I'm kind of
a moment-to-moment kind of guy,

181
00:09:52,997 --> 00:09:54,297
so three days...

182
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:58,388
- I can work with that.
- What does that mean exactly?

183
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,530
I could probably tell you, but...

184
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,562
I'm dying to know.

185
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,210
Showing you might be even better.

186
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:11,109
I can show you what it means
to work with it.

187
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:15,385
They're sharp, I know.

188
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:19,154
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

189
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,105
Good.

190
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:22,081
I'll miss you.

191
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,025
I know you're in there.

192
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,722
Just 'cause there's a girl at my door,
I don't have a girlfriend.

193
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,758
You're not ignoring me, right?
Because I just want to let you know

194
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,261
that I'm not gonna jump on you
every time I see you.

195
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,957
Yeah, I was just gonna ask
for a ride to school, but...

196
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,444
it's cool, I know you're busy.
I'll see you later.

197
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:00,158
That was...

198
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:02,522
the landlord's daughter.

199
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,960
How are you gonna play?

200
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,205
We've been through the storm and
the rain. We fixing to bring the pain.

201
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,540
Well, Emily, I think,
you know, I scored

202
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,943
a perfect score on my math
portion of the S.A.T.

203
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:21,546
so, you know, if the pressure's on,
I think I'm the guy to go to.

204
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:26,629
Do you have anything more to say
about that guaranteed win?

205
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:30,530
Well, I'm more of the brains...

206
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:33,391
and brawn.
I got it all. I'm the total package.

207
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,968
Are you gonna win?

208
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:42,659
Coach, could we talk about
your history of quitting,

209
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,854
first with the Panthers back in '06,
and more recently,

210
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:48,999
forfeiting your first game
as head coach of the Lions?

211
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,829
Don't know why you come out here
and waste people's time with this.

212
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:57,068
This is romantic.

213
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,258
Nice breeze.
It's perfect.

214
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:01,753
Good sandwiches.

215
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,456
Good sandwiches
that I put my heart and soul into.

216
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:08,223
It's hard making peanut butters.

217
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:10,098
Your phone is ringing.

218
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,464
It's just Devin.
I'll call her back later.

219
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:17,889
You sure?

220
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,679
We're having our romantic picnic
right now, okay?

221
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:21,807
That's right.

222
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,476
Wait.

223
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:27,871
Excuse me, miss.
Can I get some service, please?

224
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:33,047
Excuse me, miss?

225
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,213
Can I get some menus over here
and some service?

226
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,386
Thank you.

227
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:42,986
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:45,297
Vince, you really need to go away.

229
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:48,100
- I can't get some food?
- It don't make no sense you being here.

230
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,268
Why not?

231
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,706
You know
your dad got the best ribs in town.

232
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:52,890
What you want?

233
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,461
Hey, Mr. Merriweather.

234
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:59,444
I was talking to your daughter Jess.
About to order some baby back ribs.

235
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:03,682
- You can get that over at the counter.
- I was gon' sit here and eat it...

236
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,785
Get your ass over to the counter.

237
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:09,205
Yes, sir.

238
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,583
Here. It was a pleasure
talking to you, Jess.

239
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:16,496
I'll see you around to school.

240
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,367
Hey, it's the girl
who loves her candy.

241
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:27,176
Got you some gummy bears.

242
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:31,662
Our little thing the other night,

243
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:35,456
that was a mistake, okay?
That was a big mistake.

244
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,215
And I would really appreciate it

245
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,482
if you didn't try to treat me
like a girlfriend,

246
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:42,497
and I don't need you buying me stuff.
I don't want anything from you.

247
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,060
Especially not for you to talk about me
to your football buddies.

248
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:47,559
I didn't say anything
to my football buddies.

249
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,827
I'll bet you didn't.

250
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:50,767
Just forget it.

251
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:53,221
We just don't have to talk
at all anymore, okay?

252
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:54,566
Sorry. I just...

253
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,170
I think you're cute and I would really
love to go out again sometime, but...

254
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:00,696
I must be...

255
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,682
I don't know.
Sorry.

256
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:12,250
Julie, I know that you probably
do not think this is a big deal,

257
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,648
but I assure you
this is a gigantic deal.

258
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:18,438
You had best turn around from wherever
you are and get yourself home,

259
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:20,817
and you answer the phone
when I call you!

260
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,613
You are my favorite daughter.

261
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:28,325
Be right back, sweetie.

262
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,108
Five, six, seven, eight...
Wait, no. You know what?

263
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,964
I think we should go...
Because that would add more energy...

264
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:40,746
No, come on.
Seriously, it's fine.

265
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,380
Is fine okay for TV?

266
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:46,551
'Cause if y'all okay with fine, we can
stop right now. Five, six, seven, eight.

267
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:55,519
Bring it in, guys.
Let's go.

268
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:57,332
Here we go, here we go.

269
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,004
Listen up. Who can tell me
McNulty's record?

270
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:02,300
- Yeah, they never lost.
- That's right,

271
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,970
but we're gonna change that.
Here's how we're gonna do it.

272
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:09,533
We're gonna play 11 on offense today,
but we are gonna do 13 on defense.

273
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,946
Because if you can punch
one hole into 13,

274
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:15,872
you damn well ought to be able
to punch 2 holes into 11. Understood?

275
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,049
Yes, sir.

276
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:20,377
We got Tim and Billy
coming over to help.

277
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,836
You boys ever played
a couple state champions?

278
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,809
- Here we go!
- Show 'em your ring, Tim.

279
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:30,128
All the guys in yellow on defense,
over there, huddle 'em up.

280
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:36,673
We feel good!
How you guys feel?

281
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,493
- Let's go!
- Here we go! Let's go!

282
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,900
Strong red, strong red!

283
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:55,579
- You was open on that one?
- I got hit before I got the ball.

284
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,105
Guy's all over the place.
So fast...

285
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:00,048
All right, let's do it.

286
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,671
- It's like playing against a wall.
- I know. I can feel it.

287
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:15,640
- We're not ready for this.
- Here we go.

288
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:26,885
- Copeland, you got to respond to that!
- They're getting there.

289
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:28,894
Touchdown!

290
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,488
- Love it.
- Good job.

291
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,462
Seriously, I'm telling you right now,
if we had to play a game tomorrow

292
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:46,963
I would be a madman.

293
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,174
- So here's what I want.
- I was running...

294
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:52,210
- Just stop talking about football.
- How's being pregnant?

295
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:56,014
It's great. She thinks her water's
gonna break every 15 minutes.

296
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,057
Really? I mean,
I know you have the belly,

297
00:16:59,182 --> 00:17:01,753
but not the baby cause she asked <i>me</i>
what it was like to be pregnant.

298
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,814
You could thank me for always being
your designated driver.

299
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:08,526
I thank you constantly.
I do constantly, baby.

300
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,829
Cause I love you.
It's true.

301
00:17:12,181 --> 00:17:14,381
- What?
- Y'all know what I miss?

302
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:17,436
Getting on that bull
and letting off some steam.

303
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,361
- I'd ride that bull. I would.
- No, you shouldn't.

304
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:24,409
- Not a good call.
- It's totally a good call.

305
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,199
Don't get on the death ride.

306
00:17:26,324 --> 00:17:28,171
- I'm riding the bull.
- Yeah, you are.

307
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,617
- What'd you just do?
- She's amazing.

308
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,678
- Can I go next?
- Sure, little lady.

309
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:36,844
This might not end well.

310
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,424
Oh, my god...

311
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:42,861
I'm ready!

312
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:49,025
She's pretty good.

313
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,735
- That's very smooth.
- You missed me.

314
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:10,034
You have no idea.

315
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,578
See you later.
All right, buddy.

316
00:18:19,703 --> 00:18:21,580
- Take it easy, all. Bye.
- Landry!

317
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:24,503
Hey, Landry.
How are you doing?

318
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,250
- Good.
- Good to see you.

319
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,580
- Good to see you at East Dillon.
- I know.

320
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:31,401
Well, I had to drop off
something for coach.

321
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,787
- Rushing off to my school.
- Right.

322
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,515
Have you talked to Matt and Jules

323
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,151
since they've gone off
on their big trip to Austin?

324
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:42,078
- No, not since they left.
- Yeah.

325
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:45,749
Listen, I'm just gonna be
real straightforward with you.

326
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:48,097
My daughter's awol,
I'm sick about it,

327
00:18:48,222 --> 00:18:50,695
and if you could shed any light
on where they are

328
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,200
and when they're gonna be there,
it would be real helpful to me.

329
00:18:55,723 --> 00:18:58,731
I don't know obviously
their whole schedule...

330
00:18:58,856 --> 00:19:02,463
I think they were planning
on seeing <i>The Heartless Bastards</i>

331
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,309
At Emo's tomorrow night.

332
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,978
- That's good to...
- Like 7:30 or 8 or something.

333
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,480
But other than that...

334
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,315
And you know where they're staying?

335
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:13,967
Are you going?
Are you gonna go visit?

336
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:16,977
No, but I just...
I'm a mother.

337
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:21,357
All right, I'll have to get over
to my school now, but...

338
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:22,894
- Okay.
- Nice to see you.

339
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,497
- It was good to see you.
- Thank you.

340
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:39,258
- Becky, right?
- Yeah.

341
00:19:40,098 --> 00:19:41,098
I'm Lyla.

342
00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:43,787
- Yeah, I remember.
- Is Tim around?

343
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,975
No, I haven't seen him.

344
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,588
So you're in college, right?

345
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:51,979
Is it great?

346
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:54,904
Yeah.
It's pretty cool.

347
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:58,861
- Guess I've been homesick lately.
- For Dillon?

348
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,325
Yeah, I didn't expect that either.

349
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:04,872
Did you come back
cause you miss Tim?

350
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:11,209
I really don't know
what I'm doing here.

351
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:15,778
You go away to college and...

352
00:20:17,528 --> 00:20:21,228
You think you're getting over this thing
'cause being away helps with that.

353
00:20:21,872 --> 00:20:22,872
But...

354
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:27,016
Now I'm here and here we are.

355
00:20:29,943 --> 00:20:31,854
I'll tell Tim you stopped by.

356
00:20:35,372 --> 00:20:36,401
You're so lucky.

357
00:20:39,134 --> 00:20:40,134
So pretty.

358
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:53,543
This is the McNulty film. I want you
to watch it together. Understood?

359
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,287
- Yes, sir.
- All right, good.

360
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,991
- Anything confusing about that?
- Where?

361
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,761
Wherever you can find out.
Would you step out so I can see the TV?

362
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,033
Okay.

363
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:13,730
- Why do we have to get killed on TV?
- I don't know what we're gonna do.

364
00:21:14,348 --> 00:21:15,798
Gotta do something.

365
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,780
- Look who it is.
- Look who it is.

366
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,649
- What are you doing?
- Seriously?

367
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,078
- Watching game tape? In sears?
- What's it look like, genius?

368
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,021
Funny.

369
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,858
I'm surprised you haven't
stolen one of these.

370
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:34,576
Dude, shut up.

371
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:36,920
Got a problem?

372
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:39,589
Nah, but I can get one real quick.

373
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,650
Can I help you boys?

374
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:43,760
Yeah.

375
00:21:44,022 --> 00:21:46,671
Why don't you get the hell
out of my department and my store?

376
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:49,541
- For what?
- Cause I'm one jackass comment

377
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,267
away from doing some serious damage.

378
00:21:52,198 --> 00:21:54,641
And if that happens,
I would lose my job...

379
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,440
And I love my job.
You get me?

380
00:21:58,741 --> 00:22:00,652
Let's go. Let's go, man.

381
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,599
See ya.

382
00:22:04,413 --> 00:22:06,624
From the east side.
Coach, I didn't even know.

383
00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:07,872
What's up?

384
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:08,952
Down.

385
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,896
- Look for the gaps.
- Yes, sir.

386
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:18,724
- Get off the bedspread.
- What?

387
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:21,687
They don't wash it. There's, like
bugs that live in it. Get off.

388
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:22,912
Okay, sorry.

389
00:22:23,754 --> 00:22:25,377
Get some kind of disease.

390
00:22:26,198 --> 00:22:28,346
- Jesus.
- There. Now you can sit down.

391
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,885
Would you like to dance?

392
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,986
- Are you being serious?
- Yeah, it's pretty music.

393
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:42,193
Mr. Romance.

394
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,999
Shut up.
Stop ruining the moment.

395
00:22:44,124 --> 00:22:47,844
- I am not ruining the moment.
- Shut up and enjoy it.

396
00:22:47,969 --> 00:22:49,601
We're in a hotel dancing.

397
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:57,778
- This is real romantical.
- It's beautiful. Look, we're in Austin.

398
00:22:58,303 --> 00:22:59,653
It's the capital.

399
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:17,117
Thanks for coming back.

400
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,166
You're welcome.

401
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:31,464
I can't believe my son

402
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,270
gon' be on TV.

403
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:37,313
Yeah, your son's gon' get
his butt whooped on TV too.

404
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:39,528
You don't know that.

405
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,546
I got to find something to wear.

406
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:46,903
Wear for what?

407
00:23:47,453 --> 00:23:48,553
To the game.

408
00:23:49,112 --> 00:23:52,209
You don't got to come all the way up
to McNulty just to see me lose.

409
00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:57,249
Selena said she'd drop me off.

410
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,182
Look, I need to see you play.

411
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:05,963
- I do.
- Okay.

412
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,930
I won't make no scenes or nothing.

413
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:14,986
I'll be cleaned up.

414
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:17,747
I'm going to Austin tomorrow.

415
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:21,459
- You're what?
- I'm going to find our daughter.

416
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,902
- Listen, babe...
- I don't care that she is 17.

417
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,954
She bald-faced lied to us.

418
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:28,611
Not asking our permission.

419
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:32,136
We told her not to go.
We expressly said "Do not go to Austin",

420
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,605
and she went off without telling us.

421
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:36,880
Even though we told her not
to go, she's there.

422
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:40,971
- You can't find her in a festival.
- She's not answered one of my calls.

423
00:24:41,096 --> 00:24:42,681
I have no idea where she is.

424
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:44,406
She has not called us.

425
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:48,490
She could be...
I have no idea if she's okay.

426
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,004
I am concerned.

427
00:24:50,677 --> 00:24:53,351
I can't think
of another thing right now.

428
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:57,328
Can't focus on anything,
so I'm gonna go to Austin to find her.

429
00:25:02,055 --> 00:25:05,305
- And I support your decision 100%.
- Thank you, babe.

430
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,057
It's so darn selfish.

431
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,825
But more importantly...

432
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:15,185
More importantly, Riggins Rigs,
granted, it's not doing so well.

433
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,683
I understand that hence me
in the trailer now. That will change.

434
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:22,168
So give me six months, a year.

435
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:24,739
He's got his kid and all this stuff.
It's gonna get busy.

436
00:25:24,864 --> 00:25:27,900
I'm pitching away, doing my thing.
Handing out cards. All this stuff.

437
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:30,839
It's gonna get super busy.
I'll be under that car all the time.

438
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:33,646
That's where you come in,
Miss Garrity.

439
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:38,586
We're gonna need someone to manage it
when it gets, like, super busy.

440
00:25:39,032 --> 00:25:42,540
Granted, yeah, it's a simple life,
but it's kind of a great life.

441
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:44,808
- That's your pitch?
- Yeah.

442
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:47,933
Take that.

443
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:52,550
- That's a hard one to walk away from.
- So don't.

444
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:55,386
- Tim...
- I'm serious.

445
00:26:04,075 --> 00:26:06,114
- What do you want?
- You.

446
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,810
What else do you want?

447
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:25,482
You.

448
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:52,712
Hey, what's wrong?

449
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:56,792
What's going on?

450
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,350
Why would she do that?

451
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:01,465
Scare us to death like that?

452
00:27:02,324 --> 00:27:03,648
I trust Julie.

453
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:05,329
I trust Matt.

454
00:27:06,364 --> 00:27:08,793
And I know that she's safe
anywhere, all right?

455
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:12,941
I don't know that.
I don't know at all that she's safe.

456
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,000
She has not returned one phone call.

457
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:18,215
I don't know why she would do that.

458
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,505
Because she's 17 years old.
That's why.

459
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:22,405
Just breaks my heart.

460
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:32,385
The more we make her try to stay,
the more she's gonna stray.

461
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,360
I know, but I hate it.
I don't want her to go.

462
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,690
But I know she's gonna go and...

463
00:27:41,545 --> 00:27:43,045
I don't want her to.

464
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,523
You're not going, are you?

465
00:27:47,714 --> 00:27:48,927
To Austin?

466
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,874
Seems kind of silly, I guess.

467
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:59,377
I'm just gonna beat her ass
when she gets home.

468
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:11,647
- Hello?
- Hey, Matt. How you doing?

469
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:14,150
Yeah, no, it's good.
We saw <i>Him </i>yesterday

470
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:16,861
and we're about to go see
<i>The Heartless Bastards</i> tonight.

471
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,015
That sounds like a lot of fun.

472
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:21,829
Just a kind of a FYI.

473
00:28:22,246 --> 00:28:25,436
Miss Taylor kind of cornered me
at school yesterday

474
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:27,371
and started drilling me
with these questions

475
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,781
<i>about where you and Julie might be.</i>

476
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:30,956
Wait, what?

477
00:28:32,512 --> 00:28:36,516
And I kind of panicked and told her
that you were going to the concert,

478
00:28:36,803 --> 00:28:38,716
Which, now thinking back,
I might not

479
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:42,207
<i>should have done. Just wanted to give
you the heads-up. It's probably fine.</i>

480
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:44,055
- Wait, she doesn't know...
- <i>I'm sure</i>

481
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,182
she's not gonna come
to Austin or anything.

482
00:28:47,114 --> 00:28:48,517
But I wanted to let you know.

483
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:51,530
- <i>So there it is.</i>
- She doesn't know we're in Austin?

484
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:52,968
Great.

485
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:55,934
I think I'm gonna go cause I just let
another cat out of the bag.

486
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,643
- <i>I guess I'll talk to you later. Bye.</i>
- Thanks.

487
00:28:59,265 --> 00:29:00,615
Aren't you ready?

488
00:29:02,397 --> 00:29:04,147
You lied to your parents?

489
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,789
- I didn't lie to my parents, Matt.
- Okay, cause that was Landry

490
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:13,764
and he said that your mom was
interrogating him about where you were.

491
00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:16,621
I told them I was gonna be in Austin.
I left them a message.

492
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,824
You left them a message.
That's good.

493
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,051
Look, you're blowing it
out of proportion. It's really...

494
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:25,234
It's a big deal, cause I actually care
what your parents think about me.

495
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:27,659
I don't want them to hate me,
which is what's gonna happen

496
00:29:27,784 --> 00:29:29,718
if they think that I ran away
to Austin with you.

497
00:29:29,843 --> 00:29:32,937
I told them where I was gonna be
and sorry, I did this to make you happy.

498
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:37,396
I bought the tickets so you could
get out of Dillon, because you hate it.

499
00:29:37,521 --> 00:29:40,611
I don't hate Dillon.
I don't know what you're talking about.

500
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,785
You hate Dillon.
You only stay because of me

501
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,860
and I don't want the responsibility
of you having to stay in Dillon.

502
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:55,276
Look, hey.

503
00:29:56,517 --> 00:29:58,421
I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't...

504
00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:03,445
I didn't mean to freak out.

505
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:08,299
So let's just go see
this concert, all right?

506
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:13,907
- I'm sorry too. I didn't mean to yell.
- No, that's fine. It's fine.

507
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:17,861
Yeah.

508
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:45,577
<i>Folks, we are just
one hour away from kickoff.</i>

509
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:49,548
<i>McNnulty's rolling in an undefeated,
top-ranked team versus the Lions,</i>

510
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:52,529
<i>a team that has yet
to name a quarterback.</i>

511
00:30:52,654 --> 00:30:55,186
<i>Coach Taylor's put this team
together with spit</i>

512
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:57,889
<i>and scotch tape, and tonight,
this monumental mismatch</i>

513
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,307
<i>is gonna be captured on television.</i>

514
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,928
<i>It's a beautiful night
for football, folks.</i>

515
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:04,695
<i>Vince Howard in shotgun.</i>

516
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:06,328
Let's go, O!

517
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:10,068
<i>Cafferty goes in motion. There's
the snap. It's a speed sweep going...</i>

518
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:13,572
<i>Howard keeps it going right. Got a lane!
This could be something, folks!</i>

519
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,331
<i>Oh, and he trucks the quarterback.</i>

520
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:18,209
<i>First down to the 41.
Roll Lions.</i>

521
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:24,233
<i>Coach Taylor's moving Luke Cafferty
under center for the snap.</i>

522
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:25,951
<i>It's a little speed draw.</i>

523
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,739
<i>Lanes are up the middle.
Got some room...</i>

524
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:32,060
<i>Oh, nice run by Luke Cafferty!</i>

525
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:35,260
<i>The Lions, believe it or not, got a
little something-something going, folks.</i>

526
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,629
<i>No one saw this coming,
but this could turn out</i>

527
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,798
<i>to be one hell of a football game.</i>

528
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,072
<i>East Dillon Lions in the red zone.</i>

529
00:31:48,397 --> 00:31:51,347
<i>This could be big, folks!
Howard at quarterback...</i>

530
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:52,834
<i>There's the snap.</i>

531
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:55,538
<i>Howard takes off in a little speed draw
up the middle.</i>

532
00:31:55,715 --> 00:31:57,115
<i>Got a little room!</i>

533
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,200
<i>This kid's got something.</i>

534
00:32:00,508 --> 00:32:02,967
<i>Oh, my goodness.
A touchdown, East Dillon Lions!</i>

535
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:04,122
<i>Touchdown!</i>

536
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,125
<i>East scores,
and that is the first touchdown</i>

537
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,543
<i>McNulty has given up in four games.</i>

538
00:32:09,707 --> 00:32:12,429
<i>It looks like
the East Dillon Lions have found</i>

539
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,800
<i>an identity, folks,
and quite possibly</i>

540
00:32:15,323 --> 00:32:17,803
- <i>a quarterback that is the real deal.</i>
- Yeah!

541
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:20,726
<i>Here we go!
Late in the second half.</i>

542
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:23,609
<i>These Lions have battled
these Mavericks all night long,</i>

543
00:32:23,931 --> 00:32:26,578
<i>and they are just seven points away
from tying this game up!</i>

544
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:29,446
<i>Something no one,
including yours truly,</i>

545
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:31,866
<i>thought was even remotely possible.</i>

546
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,120
Good job!
Good job!

547
00:32:38,911 --> 00:32:40,958
<i>Howard takes the snap,
he rolls left...</i>

548
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:42,427
<i>Pressure coming!</i>

549
00:32:43,402 --> 00:32:44,587
Upfield, go!

550
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:47,913
<i>This could be big, folks!</i>

551
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:51,393
<i>Inside the ten-yard line...</i>

552
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,538
<i>First down, Lions.</i>

553
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:56,826
Get your ass up.
Let's go!

554
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,769
Let's go, let's go!

555
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,998
<i>Howard takes the snap...</i>

556
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,724
- Right there, right there!
- <i>Under pressure. Great spin move.</i>

557
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,285
<i>Howard's trying to make a play!</i>

558
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,497
<i>He's gonna have
to get rid of the ball!</i>

559
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:22,033
<i>Oh, and he gets pasted,
in the back field, the clock winds out,</i>

560
00:33:22,862 --> 00:33:25,669
<i>and the upset is not to be, folks.</i>

561
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:28,740
- Get off me, man.
- <i>We have seen a team emerge tonight,</i>

562
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:32,173
<i>lead by a young quarterback,
Vince Howard,</i>

563
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:36,046
- <i>the rising star of the Lions.</i>
- Hey, let's go. Bring it in. Let's go.

564
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:37,221
Here we go.

565
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:39,749
Come on, fellas.
Let's go.

566
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,696
Hey, listen to me.
Listen, everyone. Listen up right now.

567
00:33:45,112 --> 00:33:49,079
Every single person out here...
Every single person out here

568
00:33:49,204 --> 00:33:51,320
respects you fellas.
Every one.

569
00:33:51,668 --> 00:33:54,483
I respect you.
You need to respect yourselves.

570
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:55,808
Hell of a job.

571
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,245
Hell of a job.

572
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,820
Take that with you, carry it,
and we're gonna build on it.

573
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:23,519
- Hey, do you want to leave?
- No, they just started playing.

574
00:34:23,696 --> 00:34:25,430
No, do you want me to leave?

575
00:34:29,285 --> 00:34:31,274
Maybe you were right.
I mean, maybe...

576
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:33,739
I should have left already.
Do you even want me to stay?

577
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,121
Of course I want you to stay!

578
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,479
I was just... I was saying
stupid things.

579
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,509
I'm sorry!
I love you, okay?

580
00:34:42,634 --> 00:34:45,708
I'm sorry! I was being stupid!
Don't think about it, okay?

581
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:47,481
Okay.

582
00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:49,276
I love you!

583
00:34:51,637 --> 00:34:52,687
I love you.

584
00:35:31,657 --> 00:35:32,657
Morning.

585
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:34,459
Morning.

586
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:56,699
Good-bye, Lyla Garrity.

587
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:03,135
Good-bye.

588
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:56,685
Really cool festival.
Thank you.

589
00:36:59,162 --> 00:37:01,112
I'm glad you had a good time.

590
00:37:02,344 --> 00:37:04,794
It was nice just
to get away with you.

591
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:21,466
I love you, Julie.

592
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:24,055
I love you, Matty.

593
00:37:33,594 --> 00:37:34,694
I better go.

594
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,677
I'll see you later?

595
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:17,829
That better have been
a great concert, babe.

596
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,216
I'm sorry...

597
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,133
Well, we have been worried sick.

598
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,838
Sorry.

599
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:28,769
I'm sorry.

600
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,014
What happened, hon?
Did something happen?

601
00:38:39,224 --> 00:38:40,774
I think he's leaving.

602
00:38:54,737 --> 00:38:55,737
It's okay.

603
00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:05,199
- That's good. That's better.
- Is it better?

604
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:09,021
Let me move these and you watch
and see if those lines come off.

605
00:39:09,352 --> 00:39:12,692
Do you really think we need a new tv?
Look, this is working just fine.

606
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,067
It might be something to invest in.

607
00:39:15,324 --> 00:39:16,704
Well, that's...

608
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:19,481
Ooh, that is... go back.
Let's watch that channel,

609
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:22,527
- 'cause it looks better.
- Alright, I don't really care.

610
00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:25,279
And I guess we could think
about getting a new tv.

611
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,000
Lorraine, you'd *be* shocked.

612
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,001
- Would we want to get a bigger screen?
- Yeah.

613
00:39:29,126 --> 00:39:30,235
- Really?
- Yeah.

614
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:51,499
How's Lyla?

615
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,380
Gone.

616
00:40:02,374 --> 00:40:04,067
Do you have a broken heart?

617
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,350
I don't know.

618
00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:12,215
Is she the love of your life?

619
00:40:28,185 --> 00:40:30,829
Maybe there's more than one soul mate
for everybody, you know?

620
00:40:32,716 --> 00:40:35,050
'Cause, like, say I'm born
in Texas, right?

621
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,804
And my soul mate's born
all the way over in Sri Lanka.

622
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,822
That seems randomly unfair.

623
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:48,346
It only makes sense
if there'd be more than one.

624
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,545
You know,
'cause you have your first,

625
00:40:50,874 --> 00:40:53,012
and it's new, and you feel...

626
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,021
things that you never thought
you'd feel

627
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,989
and they break your heart.

628
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,753
Then you cry about it,

629
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:02,628
and you're sad over it...

630
00:41:03,646 --> 00:41:06,328
And then you meet someone else.

631
00:41:07,812 --> 00:41:09,034
And for that time,

632
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,484
they're your new soul mate,
because...

633
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:14,434
they made you feel things
the other one couldn't.

634
00:41:16,651 --> 00:41:18,043
And then they break your heart.

635
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,211
Becky...

636
00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:22,299
Yeah?

637
00:41:26,703 --> 00:41:27,703
Shut up.

638
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:34,918
Please?
