1
00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:01,497
Oh, I will play the game,
Mr. Garrity.

2
00:00:01,498 --> 00:00:02,200
Do it, do it.

3
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:03,555
I will, and when I make
the national team

4
00:00:03,556 --> 00:00:04,808
and start touring all over the world,

5
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:05,898
I'll take your daughter with me.

6
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:06,845
'Cause we're getting married.

7
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:09,575
I just think that we're
too young right now.

8
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,639
And we're rushing into this,
and I don't wanna make a mistake.

9
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:12,770
Message received, Lyla.

10
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:13,730
Loud and clear.

11
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:14,959
That color looks good on you.

12
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,425
I don't have the money for it.

13
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:19,471
- Coach, I didn't mean--
- You didn't mean what?

14
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:21,282
You didn't mean to risk
my reputation, my career.

15
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:22,020
Is that what
you were gonna say?

16
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:23,253
- I'm sorry, Coach--
- You thinking about that?

17
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:24,241
He made a mistake.

18
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:25,863
And he is trying so desperately

19
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:27,621
to get back in your good graces

20
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:29,162
that he's losing
his confidence.

21
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,460
He's losing his passion.

22
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:31,472
I'm sorry, I was--

23
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:32,882
I was on
the other side of campus.

24
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:34,371
You're starting
at tailback tonight.

25
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:36,151
What the hell?
You want a hug or something?

26
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:37,001
Get outta here.

27
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:39,381
Julie finds out about this,

28
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:40,461
- that's not gonna be good.
- Listen,

29
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:41,992
you're gonna take a few
pictures,

30
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,050
it's for charity.

31
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:44,432
Nothing happened at all.

32
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:46,301
I don't appreciate
getting lied to.

33
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:47,800
So why don't you go

34
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:49,423
with your little rally girls

35
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:50,842
and just leave me alone.

36
00:00:57,347 --> 00:00:58,631
Come on, fellas, let's go!

37
00:01:00,138 --> 00:01:01,060
What do you wanna run?

38
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,803
Slot right 28 Gun-sling.

39
00:01:04,386 --> 00:01:06,331
- You serious?
- Slot right 28 Gun-sling. Go on.

40
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:08,672
Okay.

41
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:12,053
What?

42
00:01:13,257 --> 00:01:14,520
Come on, Panthers

43
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:17,952
Bring it home, boys!

44
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,520
All right, gentlemen,

45
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:21,583
this is serious.

46
00:01:21,818 --> 00:01:24,073
We're going
slot right 28 Gun-sling.

47
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:24,933
Okay?

48
00:01:24,935 --> 00:01:25,853
Oh, yeah.

49
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:28,230
All right, slot right
28 Gun-sling on one.

50
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:29,703
- Ready.
- Break.

51
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:32,163
How's those hands
of yours, seven?

52
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:33,681
- Feeling good, Riggins.
- All right!

53
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:36,601
Arw you ready for this?

54
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:39,013
Set!

55
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:41,070
White 44.

56
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:44,473
White 44.

57
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:47,161
Hut!

58
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:51,323
Saracen takes the snap

59
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:53,221
and pitches back to Riggins.

60
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:55,031
To Smash.

61
00:01:55,276 --> 00:01:56,281
What in tarnation?

62
00:01:56,288 --> 00:01:58,100
They got some kind of
a halfback option.

63
00:01:58,545 --> 00:02:00,052
Oh! And Saracen, he's open!

64
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:02,551
Wide open down
the right sideline!

65
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:06,951
Oh! He caught it!

66
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:08,130
Unbelievable!

67
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:13,281
The Panthers cruise through
their first playoff game.

68
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,460
And the celebration begins

69
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:17,221
on the Panthers' sidelines.

70
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:21,811
They said--

71
00:02:21,996 --> 00:02:23,523
They  said we couldn't do it.

72
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:24,322
Yeah, they did.

73
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:25,712
They said--

74
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:27,993
They said we didn't have
what it takes.

75
00:02:28,096 --> 00:02:28,980
Joke's on who?

76
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:31,032
We got it done,
didn't we?

77
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:32,750
Yeah!
We got it done!

78
00:02:32,755 --> 00:02:34,382
Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir.
Yes, Sir.

79
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:36,813
We went out there
and we did it together.

80
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:40,162
Y'all outta be proud
of yourselves.

81
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:43,052
And I want you to know
that I am damn proud of you!

82
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,531
Nobody pushes us around.

83
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,311
Nobody pushes us around.

84
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:48,792
Whose house?
Our house!

85
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:50,033
Whose house?
Our house!

86
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:51,400
Whose house?
Our house!

87
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:52,841
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

88
00:02:55,228 --> 00:02:57,660
You worried about next week's
game against Dunston Valley?

89
00:02:57,717 --> 00:02:58,932
Why, you know something
we don't?

90
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,291
Almost all-white team.

91
00:03:00,295 --> 00:03:01,830
Had some trouble recently
with that hazing

92
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:03,182
of a player in black face.

93
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:05,162
Oh, we don't give a dang
about all that.

94
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,883
We're just goin' down there
to play football,

95
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:09,370
and, God willing, come away
one game closer to State.

96
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:10,920
Are you saying that race
isn't an issue

97
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:12,071
for the Dillon Panthers, Mac?

98
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:12,952
No, sir, it's not.

99
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:14,583
Yet Dillon was one of the last

100
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:16,611
high school teams in Texas
to be integrated.

101
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,890
Only one black quarterback
in 40 years.

102
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:20,880
Voodoo Tatum, he left
after two games.

103
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:22,853
Which had nothing to do
with his skin color.

104
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:24,132
Look, you show me a red or

105
00:03:24,135 --> 00:03:25,811
a  black or a green player

106
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:28,001
here in Dillon that's better
than Matt Saracen,

107
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,221
he's got the job, all right?

108
00:03:29,236 --> 00:03:30,452
What about Smash Williams?

109
00:03:30,456 --> 00:03:31,723
He played quarterback on JV.

110
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:32,781
He's got quite an arm.

111
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:33,713
Smash for quarterback?

112
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:34,202
Yeah.

113
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,712
I believe Smash is better suited

114
00:03:35,718 --> 00:03:36,841
for the position he's in.

115
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:38,710
- How do you mean?
- Well, guys like Smash

116
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:40,091
and Baxter and even Voodoo,

117
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:41,342
they got a natural gift

118
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:42,322
for running the ball.

119
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:43,810
All three are black.

120
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:46,102
Are you saying this gift
has something to do

121
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:47,031
with their skin color?

122
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:49,731
What I'm saying, Karen,
and I'm saying it in a good way,

123
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:51,542
is that guys like Smash
are--

124
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:52,652
are fearless.

125
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:54,952
They're dangerous.
They're like junkyard dogs.

126
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:56,243
I mean, you want them
carrying the ball.

127
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:58,113
You want them
tearing up turf out there.

128
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:01,702
So let me get this straight.

129
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,032
Whites like Saracen 
make better quarterbacks

130
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:05,960
because they're
inherently smarter?

131
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:08,363
Well, if you wanna put it
that way, you could.

132
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:10,103
But I'm not saying that
all black guys are--

133
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:11,031
are dumb.

134
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:11,963
I'm just saying
that they got diff--

135
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:13,000
Mac, I need to talk to you.

136
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:14,731
- Coach, a couple more.
- Coach, we're not done yet.

137
00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:16,722
Sorry, folks,
we're outta time right now.

138
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:17,872
It's getting late.
You know how it is.

139
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:21,441
Well,  I think
you got your story.

140
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:32,001

144
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:17,219
Mac McGill didn't
use the word "monkey."

145
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:19,265
He said, "Junkyard dogs."

146
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:21,381
Monkeys, dogs, frogs--

147
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,533
Mac McGill said
blacks are inhuman.

148
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:25,121
That they don't think
before they act.

149
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:26,493
Like they're workhorses

150
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:27,330
for the white man.

151
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:29,612
Weel, now, you know
I'm not sure that's what he meant,

152
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:30,982
but thanks for the call.

153
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:31,592
Next.

154
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,023
Just 'cause rednecks like Mac

155
00:05:33,097 --> 00:05:34,631
learned it that way
don't make it right.

156
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:36,241
You can bet if
he's saying this filth

157
00:05:36,257 --> 00:05:37,621
about black folks in public,

158
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:40,401
him and his kind are saying
a lot worse behind closed doors.

159
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,193
Mac said blacks are shiftless.

160
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,652
That it's the white kids
who are hard workers...

161
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:46,970
Why everybody so mad at McGill?

162
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:48,992
God, I mean,
he ain't that bad.

163
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:50,550
He just says
dumb stuff sometimes.

164
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:51,900
And that's an excuse?

165
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,052
Y'all need to stop.

166
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,871
We got bigger things
to worry about.

167
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:56,431
Now there she is.

168
00:05:57,486 --> 00:05:59,113
- Oh, it's nice.
- That's the house you're talking about?

169
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:00,873
I mean, that's a real house.

170
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,991
Yes, I know it.

171
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:03,622
Dang, this is so nice.

172
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,913
Wow, Mama, did you see
the size of that closet?

173
00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:07,363
Oh, that's gonna be
my dressing room.

174
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:08,333
No it's not.

175
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:09,453
Only if I get
the second bathroom.

176
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:10,373
Listen. Listen.
Wait a minute, child,

177
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:11,682
we don't own any of it.

178
00:06:11,946 --> 00:06:14,550
That could change if you let me
submit the bid we discussed.

179
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:18,550
Well...

180
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:21,320
Mom, you said

181
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:22,770
with the 10% down
we could cover it

182
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:23,263
come on.

183
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,943
Well, that is until I get sick

184
00:06:24,948 --> 00:06:27,070
or, God forbid, one of y'all
has an accident.

185
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,020
Well, I guess we could

186
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:30,702
just keep dreaming then.

187
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:33,110
Come back every few days
'til somebody else buys it.

188
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:35,361
I knew I shouldn't
have brought y'all.

189
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:38,202
But it is nice, huh?

190
00:06:38,318 --> 00:06:39,682
- For real.
- Yeah.

191
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:42,763
You skipped class?

192
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:45,653
Julie, you skipped class?

193
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:47,540
It was only one time.

194
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:50,460
Ms. Carroll told me
you skipped three classes.

195
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:53,601
It was just P.E.

196
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:02,362
Look, Ms. Taylor,
we're really sorry.

197
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:03,400
We will never do it again.

198
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:05,853
Well, Tyra, that really sounds
like a hollow apology to me.

199
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,113
So you can just save it.

200
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:10,112
But I'll tell you
what you are gonna do

201
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:12,123
is you're gonna be in P.E.
for every class

202
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,580
for the rest of the semester.

203
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:16,521
And in terms of making up
the classes that you missed,

204
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:18,643
Ms. Carroll made
a real good suggestion.

205
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:20,670
Which is that both of y'all
are gonna play

206
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:21,710
in the Powderpuff game.

207
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,351
Practices start this afternoon.

208
00:07:23,357 --> 00:07:24,250
You will not miss one of them.

209
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:25,743
You have got
to be kidding me.

210
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:27,260
- You wouldn't do that.
- Do I look like I'm kidding y'all?

211
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:29,193
You wouldn't--
You wouldn't do that to me.

212
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:30,180
Yeah, I would.

213
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:31,692
But...

214
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:32,952
Now, listen up

215
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:37,611
Why is he here?

216
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,403
This is gonna be so awkward.

217
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:42,372
Ladies.

218
00:07:42,877 --> 00:07:43,490
Ladies.

219
00:07:43,907 --> 00:07:45,541
Over here.
I'm Landry Clarke.

220
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:46,533
Your official

221
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,933
Powderpuff referee.

222
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:49,423
Just wanted
to start things off,

223
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:51,453
and say, uh, let's just
keep this clean.

224
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:52,693
And let's just play this--

225
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:54,382
this beautiful game in--

226
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:56,182
in the spirit that it
was meant to be played in.

227
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,090
Thank you, Landry.

228
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:00,150
Now ladies, let's meet.
this year's

229
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:02,171
Powderpuff Panther coaches.
Huh?

230
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:06,880
We've got Matthew Saracen
and Timothy Riggins.

231
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:10,123
You can shoot me now
if you want to.

232
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:10,900
All right, Tim,

233
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,902
- you call it.
- Tails, ma'am.

234
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:15,102
Matt, you get first pick.

235
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:15,781
Okay.

236
00:08:20,696 --> 00:08:23,330
Okay, uh, I pick Tyra, please.

237
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:26,990
All right, Tyra.

238
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:32,590
Tim?

239
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:34,813
Does anyone here
know how to chop block?

240
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:36,442
I do.

241
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:37,611
Nice, let's go.

242
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:38,903
All right.

243
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:43,313
Uh...Laurel.

244
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:45,613
Good call, Laurel.

245
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,263
Let's go, Garrity.

246
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,061
Um, I'm gonna pick

247
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:00,571
Julie Taylor, please.

248
00:09:01,118 --> 00:09:02,291
- Please.
- Come on, Julie!

249
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:11,452
Great.

250
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:32,091
Hey, how you doin'?

251
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:33,622
Good, how're you?

252
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:42,181
How ya doin'?

253
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:44,320
I'm doing good, man.

254
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:46,800
Little bit crazy for me
to come back to school.

255
00:09:46,975 --> 00:09:48,670
Had a free pass here
for a while but...

256
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:51,390
I'll catch y'all later.

257
00:09:57,685 --> 00:10:00,570
Only applies to certain
rural interstates

258
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:01,902
in specified counties.

259
00:10:02,465 --> 00:10:03,892
Y'all  just think about that--

260
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:06,292
Hey, guys.
Can I talk to you a minute?

261
00:10:06,598 --> 00:10:07,170
Yeah.

262
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:09,221
Uh...read your books.

263
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,323
I'll get the questions later.

264
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:11,630
You guys wanna get
a driver's license,

265
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,911
you gotta know
the finer points.

266
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,421
Been listening
to the radio, huh?

267
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:22,172
I just got done talking
to the superintendent.

268
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:23,802
They're getting calls
from newspapers and stations

269
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:24,861
all over the state.

270
00:10:24,985 --> 00:10:26,400
Like they got nothing else
better to do.

271
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:27,553
You need to issue

272
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:28,841
a public apology.

273
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:29,880
Apology for what?

274
00:10:29,908 --> 00:10:30,651
For being truthful?

275
00:10:30,656 --> 00:10:31,753
That's not the way
people heard it.

276
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:32,602
What--what people?

277
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:34,012
A bunch of damn P.C.
sons of bitches

278
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:35,303
trying to get my job?

279
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:37,570
Afraid it's not just
a bunch of sons of bitches.

280
00:10:38,218 --> 00:10:39,291
Well, all right.

281
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:41,441
You're telling me
that you think Matt Saracen

282
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:44,060
has as much natural ability
as a Smash?

283
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:45,631
What I'm telling you

284
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:47,653
is that it's not
too damn smart

285
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:49,251
to be making generalizations

286
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:50,390
about people's abilities 

287
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,511
based on their color.
Think about that.

288
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,570
That's what I'm saying.

289
00:10:54,577 --> 00:10:55,710
All right. All right.

290
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,090
What's done is done.

291
00:10:57,635 --> 00:10:59,092
No apology's
gonna change that.

292
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:02,123
I'm not making a request.

293
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:14,292
And you ain't gonna share?

294
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:17,301
I thought you were
on some kind of special diet.

295
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:18,262
I  am.

296
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:19,380
No sweets.

297
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:21,003
Except for sweet chocolate.

298
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:25,240
Here you go, baby.

299
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:28,620
I wasn't talking about
the cake.

300
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:35,481
Mmm, okay enough.

301
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:36,640
Enough.

302
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:41,441
I can't believe
I picked Julie third.

303
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:43,080
I mean she--
Now she hates me.

304
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:44,372
I'm tellin' you, I was reading

305
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:45,612
up on pheromones last night.

306
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:47,003
I really think they work.

307
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:49,130
There's no smell
that's gonna make Julie

308
00:11:49,135 --> 00:11:50,210
not hate me anymore.

309
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:52,183
A lot of studies
have shown that

310
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,750
responses to odors,

311
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,531
you know,
depend on emotions

312
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:57,413
felt whenever
that odor was first smelled.

313
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,601
Okay, even if that wasn't

314
00:11:58,605 --> 00:12:00,460
the stupidest thing
that I've ever heard,

315
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:01,590
I mean, I don't even know what

316
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:03,022
kinda smells Julie would like.

317
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:05,491
Well, I mean, she likes
her dad, doesn't she?

318
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,352
So, why don't you figure out
what type of soap he uses.

319
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:11,693
Then you can go out
and get that kind of soap.

320
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:12,800
You're retarded.

321
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,082
Hey, at least just try it.

322
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:15,291
Hey, guys, guys,
check it out, man.

323
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:16,401
Mac's on TV.

324
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:18,761
Let me turn it up.

325
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:28,332
I believe that all of our
players, regardless of color,

326
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:30,512
contribute to the spirit
and the success

327
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:31,852
of the Dillon Panthers.

328
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:35,242
My comments were not intended
to hurt anybody.

329
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:37,371
And I apologize if they did.

330
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:39,122
Thank you.

331
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:42,942
Has there been any talk
of suspension?

332
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:44,973
Are you gonna meet
with the players?

333
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:45,940
Coach, just one question. 

334
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:47,131
What was that?

335
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:48,471
You call that an apology?

336
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,142
Tell me what else
you'd call that, then.

337
00:12:50,148 --> 00:12:51,993
A lame-ass excuse.

338
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:53,602
What is the big deal?

339
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:55,590
I mean it's not like he yelled
out racist slurs or anything.

340
00:12:55,597 --> 00:12:56,861
Yeah, but if we were up at UT

341
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,202
right  now, he'd be fired.

342
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:58,902
Exactly.

343
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:00,261
Fortunately for us,
he's not.

344
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:01,013
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say

345
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:02,872
'cause you're white
and obviously selfish.

346
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:06,191
Come on, y'all,
it ain't that deep.

347
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:07,380
What you want Mac to do,

348
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:08,451
pay out reparations

349
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,832
to all the Negroes in Dillon?

350
00:13:13,768 --> 00:13:14,622
Bye.

351
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:15,993
Wave.

352
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:17,393
We was just playing.

353
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:19,820
Yeah, well,
enjoy your sandbox, boys.

354
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:24,233
A year of detention

355
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:25,730
is preferable to Powderpuff.

356
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:26,971
Okay, I don't need
to spend a week

357
00:13:26,978 --> 00:13:29,742
watching Tim Riggins teach
rally girls how to tackle.

358
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:30,853
It's pathetic.

359
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,121
Oh, and then he has the gall

360
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:34,710
to pick that bony little--

361
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:36,162
- Lyla.
- Hey, guys.

362
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:38,593
Hey, Tyra, my dad says
your mom's doing

363
00:13:38,597 --> 00:13:39,473
really good on the job.

364
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:40,263
Really?

365
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:43,142
Wow, maybe she'll get
her own dealership one day.

366
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:46,043
Yeah, I just thought

367
00:13:46,048 --> 00:13:47,700
it'd be good to know
she's doing really well.

368
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:50,491
That's real nice to know.

369
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:55,980
Hey, Tyra.

370
00:13:56,108 --> 00:13:57,703
I was surprised to see you
on the field today.

371
00:13:57,777 --> 00:14:00,012
Thought you hated football.

372
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,722
You know what,
I changed my mind.

373
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:08,082
I'm gonna get real
into Powderpuff this year.

374
00:14:08,618 --> 00:14:11,001
If you want, I'll jack up Greer
for disrespecting you.

375
00:14:11,077 --> 00:14:12,792
Okay, you know
it's not about me.

376
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:15,292
It's about you taking
this Mac thing seriously.

377
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:17,543
Wave, I'm not Jesse Jackson,

378
00:14:17,638 --> 00:14:19,012
all right?
My cause is football.

379
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:20,353
Okay then, who are you?

380
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:22,311
Because it shouldn't mean
playing dumb.

381
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,251
Look, I don't see Matty or Rigg

382
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:25,283
jumping up on a soap box

383
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:27,040
every time a brother
says something messed up.

384
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:29,232
You know why, 'cause it's
a completely different thing.

385
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:30,912
Well, then,
that's racist right there.

386
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:34,082
Me being expected to act
differently 'cause I'm black.

387
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:38,030
That's kinda the burden
that you were born with, baby.

388
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:40,622
The burden
and the blessing.

389
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:42,873
You know, you get all

390
00:14:42,927 --> 00:14:45,052
sexy, sexy
when you get all preachy.

391
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:46,363
You know what, Brian,
don't do this, okay.

392
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:48,181
Don't turn this into a joke.

393
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:51,093
It's important, I want you
to really think about this.

394
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:53,282
Wave, I respect
your opinion on this.

395
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:54,843
I do.

396
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:57,611
But could you please just
recognize for one second

397
00:14:57,626 --> 00:14:59,633
that I just got through
some real drama.

398
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:01,950
I mean, I'm just getting
my swagger back.

399
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:05,143
I can't be sidetracked with
things I can't control, baby.

400
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:06,763
Look...

401
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:09,781
I know that you're dealing
with a lot right now.

402
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:12,130
Okay, and I'm here for you.

403
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:13,693
But sooner or later,

404
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:16,883
you're gonna have to peek out
from behind those blinders.

405
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:24,072
Okay, I wanna see

406
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:26,280
both partners
using the scalpel.

407
00:15:27,145 --> 00:15:28,793
And both partners
taking notes.

408
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:38,480
All right, I'm ready.
You ready?

409
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,172
- I guess.
- You sure?

410
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:42,832
Now, look, if it's--
if it's any consolation,

411
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:44,462
I--I heard that these frogs
had a very long

412
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:45,802
and fulfilling life.

413
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:46,542
So it's all right.

414
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:47,971
Lots of flies.

415
00:15:48,335 --> 00:15:49,101
And lots of...

416
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,070
Tadpoles.

417
00:15:59,227 --> 00:16:00,272
You want me to do this?

418
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:01,852
'Cause I can.

419
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:03,740
No, no, no, I got it.
Don't worry about it.

420
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,640
All right, well,

421
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:09,342
just give me a minute.

422
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:11,190
Is everything good?

423
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,880
Yes, sir, Mr. Utz,
we were just...

424
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:15,110
just getting started.

425
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,041
Now, Jason, if you just
wanna observe, it's okay.

426
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:20,781
It's all anybody expects.

427
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:30,681
No, I'd like to just go ahead
and finish the incision.

428
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:31,731
It's up to you.

429
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:38,902
Let's go for ten, ladies.

430
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:40,630
As one, count 'em out as ten.

431
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:44,381
- One...two...three.
- Let's go!

432
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:45,581
As one, come on.

433
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:48,291
D-split 45, Garrity.

434
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:49,621
Hut--hut.

435
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:51,523
Let's go, ladies.
Let's go.

436
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:55,472
Nice.
Good execution.

437
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:57,480
I'm starting
to see something, ladies.

438
00:16:57,738 --> 00:16:58,801
Get some blocks, here.

439
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:00,842
- Let's get some blocks.
- Ready, 44...

440
00:17:01,135 --> 00:17:03,243
Hot--hot crossfire.

441
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:04,912
Set, uh, hut--hut--hut.

442
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:05,972
There ya' go.
Now go, now go.

443
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:07,233
Oh, bad, bad, okay.

444
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:09,261
We are a team of one, ladies.

445
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:11,501
That's fine um, you just wanna
make sure you catch this.

446
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:13,492
One unit.
Let's go, let's go.

447
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:15,221
We've got to get this together.
Hey, Matt!

448
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:16,843
- Yeah?
- Figure out what the hell

449
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:18,003
you want me to do.

450
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:20,060
You see that team over there?

451
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:21,103
Yeah.

452
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:22,711
Looks a lot better than us.

453
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,501
Set.
Hut--hut!

454
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,423
Yes, you got the snap.

455
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:31,843
What was that?

456
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:33,653
You throw like a damn girl.

457
00:17:34,215 --> 00:17:35,323
Are you serious, Matt?

458
00:17:35,686 --> 00:17:36,841
That is your quarterback?

459
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:38,310
She's really good
at handing off.

460
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,241
Good job, Coach.

461
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:40,372
Hut--hut.

462
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:44,271
Oh, I'm--
I'm sorry.

463
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:45,942
- Really? Really?
- I'm sorry.

464
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:46,843
Hold on.
Not her, not her.

465
00:17:46,977 --> 00:17:48,593
It's all right.
It's all right, we're a team.

466
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:49,552
Teammates.

467
00:17:49,556 --> 00:17:52,251
I'm starting to see a "W"
in my eyes, let's go!

468
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:57,563
Matt, okay,
this isn't working for me.

469
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:58,983
It's not working
for me either.

470
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:03,100
Hi.

471
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:04,820
Julie?

472
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:05,602
Yep.

473
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:07,822
You think maybe you could
play quarterback?

474
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:11,213
Hmm, let's see,
I was your third pick.

475
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:13,831
Am I even qualified
to talk to QB one?

476
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,451
You're the only one
who knows how to play.

477
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:18,670
I do know how to play.
But, uh,

478
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:20,242
frankly.....

479
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:22,002
I don't care.

480
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:24,251
Um, excuse me.
Lovebirds.

481
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:26,023
Let's go.

482
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:27,523
Practice.

483
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:29,311
Please.

484
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:34,643
You're pathetic.

485
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:36,523
This is now
about victory.

486
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:37,400
Line up!

487
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:40,823
Let's go.
Strength and stamina.

488
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:42,483
One of your teammates gets hurt,

489
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:43,833
gets tired out there.

490
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:45,570
You step in,
help carry the weight.

491
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:47,132
You give 'em a hand.

492
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:48,533
Let's go!

493
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:58,390
Let's go!

494
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:02,671
Come on, man,
stop slackin'.

495
00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:04,063
Oh, yeah? Wait 'til your turn.

496
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:05,550
We'll see how fast you go.

497
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,513
Stop the chatter,
let's get it done.

498
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:08,571
Yes sir, Massa.

499
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:10,080
What'd you say, Seale?

500
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:11,250
I love this drill, sir.

501
00:19:11,405 --> 00:19:12,641
Get your ass down the field!

502
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:13,540
- Love it.
- Move it.

503
00:19:14,055 --> 00:19:15,040
- Yes, sir.
- Move it!

504
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:15,641
Yes, sir.

505
00:19:15,716 --> 00:19:16,953
You shut your mouth!

506
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:22,662
Hey, baby.

507
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:25,751
Honey,

508
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,682
I just broke up a fight
in the hallway.

509
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:31,313
Over this whole
Mac McGill thing.

510
00:19:32,248 --> 00:19:33,001
Well...

511
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:35,790
I don't know
what to tell you, babe.

512
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:36,822
Well, I don't know.

513
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:38,461
I mean, just it's clear to me
that it's not--

514
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:39,901
This thing is not going away.

515
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:41,643
I mean, these kids
were riled up.

516
00:19:41,645 --> 00:19:43,783
And it was a lot of kids.
And it was black against white.

517
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:44,753
It was racial.

518
00:19:44,845 --> 00:19:46,902
Look babe, he said
something stupid, all right?

519
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:47,912
He said something stupid.

520
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:48,802
He made an apology.

521
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:49,702
- I know.
- There's gonna be fallout,

522
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,090
- there's no way around that.
- I know, I know, I know,

523
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:52,731
but I feel like--
I feel like I--

524
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:54,093
I wanna do--
I wanna have

525
00:19:54,096 --> 00:19:55,232
some kind of a dialogue

526
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,180
for the kids, you know.

527
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:58,343
I wanna create, maybe, something
after school later this week.

528
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:00,110
- Like a forum or something.
- A forum?

529
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:01,681
Yeah, you know,
where the kids can come

530
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:03,140
and talk to each other
and air it out.

531
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:05,020
So that it's not just
coming up with their fists

532
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,210
in the middle of the hallway.

533
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,311
You know what I mean?

534
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,483
Yeah, that's a good idea.

535
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,751
Will you tell your
football players about it?

536
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,223
I think it could certainly
be good for them to come.

537
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:15,870
Sure.

538
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:17,832
Appreciate the support.

539
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:20,543
- I'll see you later.
- All right, have a good day.

540
00:20:20,965 --> 00:20:21,631
Okay.

541
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:45,860
You got a steering wheel.

542
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:48,170
You got your brake, you got
your accelerator, all right?

543
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:48,702
Where would they be?

544
00:20:48,996 --> 00:20:50,353
Well, look,
this lever over here,

545
00:20:50,357 --> 00:20:51,471
you wanna go ahead and push it.

546
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,090
Yeah, go ahead
and push it forward.

547
00:20:53,158 --> 00:20:53,710
Forward?
Okay.

548
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:54,901
Forward is brake, right.

549
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:56,263
If you wanna accelerate,

550
00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:58,253
you wanna go ahead
and push it on down

551
00:20:58,306 --> 00:20:59,243
toward your knee.

552
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,293
There ya go, down--
Woo-hoo.

553
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:02,530
There ya go.
All right, all right.

554
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:05,220
All right, so you wanna
put it in drive.

555
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:06,463
And let's check it out.

556
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:08,101
See how this puppy rolls.

557
00:21:08,797 --> 00:21:09,902
Off on the brake.

558
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:11,272
Oh, don't be shy.
Don't be shy.

559
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:12,370
Straight on through?

560
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,151
All right, all right.

561
00:21:13,245 --> 00:21:14,743
Next stop, Indy 500, huh?

562
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,423
Shut up, I'm trying
to get used to it, all right?

563
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:17,933
Just give me a minute.

564
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:18,733
I got it.

565
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,581
And once you get comfortable,
how's that feel?

566
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:21,600
It feels okay.

567
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:22,300
Yeah?

568
00:21:22,535 --> 00:21:23,022
Yeah.

569
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:23,692
This is pretty easy,

570
00:21:23,697 --> 00:21:25,412
- I could get the hang of this.
- You like it, huh?

571
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:26,171
Yeah.

572
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:27,332
Yeah, it's nice

573
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,630
Yeah, a little bit of freedom?

574
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:29,982
I could get used to it.

575
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,490
Speaking of
getting used to it,

576
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,360
how's being back at school
treating ya?

577
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:35,770
It's okay.

578
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:36,403
I guess.

579
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:37,860
Yeah?

580
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:40,471
Listen, when you
got out of the hospital,

581
00:21:41,785 --> 00:21:44,033
was everybody
just weird to you?

582
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,461
Man, I felt like
I was 100 years old.

583
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:48,891
You know, like, uh,

584
00:21:49,218 --> 00:21:50,490
there was some sort of secret

585
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:52,910
knowledge no one else possessed.
You know.

586
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:55,190
I mean, for a while there
actually I

587
00:21:55,537 --> 00:21:56,960
wanted to go back
to the hospital.

588
00:21:57,198 --> 00:21:58,423
Of course, that was partially
'cause there was

589
00:21:58,427 --> 00:22:00,750
this hot-ass nurse that just
could not get enough of me.

590
00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:01,631
Oh, I'm sure she couldn't.

591
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:05,911
You know, I just want things
to feel normal again, you know?

592
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:08,601
Yeah, well,
I hate to break it to you,

593
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:11,770
but high school is not normal.

594
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:13,502
- Brake.
- Brake?

595
00:22:13,616 --> 00:22:15,120
Brake.
Brake!

596
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:27,081
There ya go.

597
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:28,622
You have a good one.

598
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:32,490
Think I'm gonna take off.

599
00:22:32,707 --> 00:22:33,902
Okay, so, uh--

600
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,240
Don't worry,
I got your numbers.

601
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:36,180
I got your numbers
and everything.

602
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:37,293
- You good?
- I'm good.

603
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:38,440
Okay.
Cool.

604
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:42,491
Hey look, Smash,
I don't think it's right.

605
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:45,742
What Mac said, I don't--
I don't agree with it.

606
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:47,221
So you think
I should quarterback?

607
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:50,121
No--I mean, yeah.
I mean, I don't know.

608
00:22:50,277 --> 00:22:52,741
- I mean, I don't know if you play--
- I'm just playing with you, Matty.

609
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:55,263
I know what you're trying to
say, but I ain't sweatin' it.

610
00:22:55,776 --> 00:22:56,762
Neither should you.

611
00:22:57,605 --> 00:22:58,830
- You sure?
- Yeah.

612
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:01,152
Yeah, it's cool.

613
00:23:01,258 --> 00:23:02,022
All right.

614
00:23:02,218 --> 00:23:03,700
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, later.

615
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,741
- Hello?
- Hey.

616
00:23:11,536 --> 00:23:12,821
Hey, honey, how you doin'?

617
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:14,243
Grand.

618
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:16,022
How was Powderpuff?

619
00:23:16,218 --> 00:23:17,080
It was great.

620
00:23:17,318 --> 00:23:18,951
Oh, was
Powderpuff tiring?

621
00:23:19,517 --> 00:23:20,281
Where's the supper?

622
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:21,871
Oh, I don't know.
Why don't you sit down?

623
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:23,980
Don't--

624
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:26,022
Don't roll your eyes.

625
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,462
Something else
is gonna happen

626
00:23:29,478 --> 00:23:31,092
other than
this Powderpuff thing

627
00:23:31,518 --> 00:23:32,322
as a punishment

628
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,831
for you cutting class.

629
00:23:34,056 --> 00:23:34,931
I promise you

630
00:23:35,098 --> 00:23:36,400
your mom and I will
let you know

631
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:38,772
what it is when we
figure out what it is.

632
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:40,081
Yep, that's understood.

633
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:41,811
And when you figure out
what my punishment is,

634
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:42,712
- I'll be in my bedroom.

635
00:23:42,717 --> 00:23:43,783
I don't want you
to be flippant with me.

636
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:44,892
I don't want you
to be flippant.

637
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,930
- Did you hear what he just said?
- Can I tell you something?

638
00:23:47,006 --> 00:23:49,100
- Yes, I heard.
- No, no, look at me.

639
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:52,112
Please, don't do this.

640
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:54,073
Don't break our trust.

641
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:55,950
Don't take our trust
from us.

642
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,093
Please.

643
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,931
I'm sorry, today's just
been really...

644
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:06,540
Really kind of
a crappy day.

645
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:08,303
Matt's been yelling
at me all day about...

646
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:12,073
Stupid quarterback stuff.

647
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:16,251
Matt Saracen's got you
at quarterback?

648
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:20,221
Wait, honey.

649
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:21,783
Hey, come here.

650
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:23,920
What do you mean
he's got you at quarterback?

651
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:31,142
Two-zero.

652
00:24:32,408 --> 00:24:33,452
Hey, what up, Dutch Boy?

653
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:36,011
- Get a new haircut?
- Get a new hat?

654
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:39,442
What's your order, man?

655
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:41,762
I've actually been
doing some thinking.

656
00:24:42,517 --> 00:24:45,143
You know all this friction
between the team?

657
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:47,201
It's just not helping
right now, man.

658
00:24:47,716 --> 00:24:49,062
And State's coming up, so...

659
00:24:49,378 --> 00:24:50,413
You got that right.

660
00:24:50,627 --> 00:24:51,561
So, I mean,

661
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:54,161
I figure you talk to your boys
and settle 'em down.

662
00:24:54,178 --> 00:24:56,812
And we can just refocus
on the game. You know?

663
00:24:58,518 --> 00:24:59,623
You got some nerve.

664
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:02,972
The same dude who shows up
half-drunk to workouts,

665
00:25:03,396 --> 00:25:04,793
walks off practice, and throws

666
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:07,562
a glass bottle at my head
wants to tell me to talk to my boys?

667
00:25:07,736 --> 00:25:09,772
I didn't tell you.
I asked you, Williams.

668
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:11,220
No, first of all,

669
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:12,433
they ain't my boys.

670
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:14,712
You want team unity,
why don't you talk to your boys?

671
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:16,852
This football done brought us
together, but on the real,

672
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:18,311
we ain't even cool like that.

673
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:20,782
You're a lost cause,
Williams.

674
00:25:31,068 --> 00:25:31,751
Mom?

675
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:34,821
Mom?

676
00:25:40,356 --> 00:25:41,243
Hello?

677
00:25:41,978 --> 00:25:42,733
Hey.

678
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:44,240
Here, honey.

679
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:46,743
Hey, Mama.

680
00:25:47,037 --> 00:25:47,891
Ready to go?

681
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:49,020
Uh, you know...

682
00:25:49,927 --> 00:25:51,613
I'm so sorry
I didn't call you.

683
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,033
I--I--I--
I gotta get through a...

684
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:57,013
Stack of papers.
I'm so sorry, honey.

685
00:25:57,018 --> 00:25:58,331
It's okay. Well, it's good
to see you working.

686
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:02,413
Hey, Tyra.

687
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:03,220
Hi

688
00:26:03,236 --> 00:26:04,181
How you doin'?

689
00:26:04,387 --> 00:26:06,332
I'm great.
How're you?

690
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:07,780
Good.
Oh, we're just fine.

691
00:26:07,787 --> 00:26:08,971
Your mom is the greatest.

692
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:10,603
She volunteered to help me out

693
00:26:10,728 --> 00:26:12,290
and finish out tonight.
She knows everything.

694
00:26:12,366 --> 00:26:13,513
Well, she's a smart woman.

695
00:26:13,516 --> 00:26:15,803
I'm just gonna--
I'll just call, you know,

696
00:26:15,806 --> 00:26:17,652
I'll just call Mindy for a ride
later, when we're done.

697
00:26:18,386 --> 00:26:19,173
Yeah.

698
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:20,933
Okay.

699
00:26:21,686 --> 00:26:22,301
Good.

700
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,372
All right, honey.

701
00:26:24,395 --> 00:26:25,191
See you later.

702
00:26:25,396 --> 00:26:26,603
Oh, good to see you, Tyra.

703
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:27,553
Yeah.

704
00:26:30,476 --> 00:26:31,383
See ya.

705
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:35,372
Pro-left

706
00:26:35,797 --> 00:26:37,291
25 sprint option.

707
00:26:37,348 --> 00:26:37,932
Now say it.

708
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:39,812
Pro-left 25 sprint option.

709
00:26:39,838 --> 00:26:41,220
Nice, what that means is--

710
00:26:41,356 --> 00:26:43,063
That means that you're gonna
fake to the two back

711
00:26:43,206 --> 00:26:44,320
through the five hole.

712
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:45,482
You're gonna be moving down

713
00:26:45,498 --> 00:26:46,891
and you've got the option then

714
00:26:46,968 --> 00:26:48,091
to continue your run,

715
00:26:48,177 --> 00:26:49,472
or you make the pass,

716
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,663
depending on what's gonna be
more efficient for you, all right?

717
00:26:52,347 --> 00:26:54,763
All right, I'm gonna do down
about 15, cut across.

718
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:56,041
You good?

719
00:26:56,437 --> 00:26:57,080
On two.

720
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,051
Hut--hut!

721
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:00,693
Watch this, hon.

722
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:01,671
Here.

723
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:09,570
All right, that's pretty good.

724
00:27:09,756 --> 00:27:11,121
- I gotta admit--
- Pretty good?

725
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:12,163
That's a very good throw.

726
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:14,080
All right, listen, I want you
to bean me with this

727
00:27:14,396 --> 00:27:15,570
as I make it for the house.

728
00:27:15,997 --> 00:27:16,742
You ready?

729
00:27:16,988 --> 00:27:17,683
On two.

730
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:19,013
Hut, hut!

731
00:27:25,335 --> 00:27:27,593
No matter what happens today,

732
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:29,780
we're all gonna be winners.

733
00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:30,580
Please.

734
00:27:30,637 --> 00:27:32,141
We will not accept a loss.

735
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:33,781
We will not accept it.

736
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:36,540
One...two...three...
Win!

737
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:37,320
Let's go!

738
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:51,471
Touchdown!

739
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,220
Great job, ladies.

740
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:13,161
Bring it on!

741
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:24,221
Blue 42.

742
00:28:37,636 --> 00:28:38,953
This is supposed to be fun.

743
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:40,190
Oh, honey, this is fun.

744
00:28:40,198 --> 00:28:41,253
This still
about Riggins, because--

745
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:42,421
Oh, please,
not even close.

746
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:44,351
- What is your problem?
- My problem?

747
00:28:44,987 --> 00:28:47,303
My problem is your dad,
Buddy Garrity,

748
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:48,433
and him having his dirty hands

749
00:28:48,466 --> 00:28:50,013
all over my mom, his employee.

750
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,323
What are you talking about?

751
00:28:53,486 --> 00:28:55,323
You know what?
You are just a spoiled little snob.

752
00:28:55,947 --> 00:28:58,212
You're not gonna
win this game.

753
00:29:03,566 --> 00:29:04,990
Come on, throw it!

754
00:29:04,996 --> 00:29:06,112
You wanna throw it!

755
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:12,521
She got the ball off.

756
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,431
That's a sack.

757
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:15,342
What the hell
kinda call is that?

758
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:16,892
Son, you're blind.

759
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:18,383
- Honey.
- What?

760
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:20,391
- Calm down.
- Excuse me.

761
00:29:20,816 --> 00:29:22,052
Stay off of my line.

762
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:23,441
- What'd you say to me?
- My line.

763
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,461
Right there, that line.

764
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:26,961
That one right there
that's mine.

765
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:28,393
Excuse me.

766
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,622
Excuse me.

767
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,072
That's your first one.

768
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:35,691
This is it.
This is our last chance.

769
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:37,240
We can either
go home with a tie.

770
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:38,540
Or we can go home
with a win.

771
00:29:38,547 --> 00:29:42,043
How 'bout we run the 25-right
sprint option?

772
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:46,213
Hut!

773
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:53,731
Get her

774
00:29:54,265 --> 00:29:55,532
Kick her knees!

775
00:29:55,656 --> 00:29:56,931
Kick her knees!

776
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,843
Keep runnin'.
Keep runnin'.

777
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:03,483
That a girl!

778
00:30:03,575 --> 00:30:04,652
Keep runnin'!

779
00:30:12,295 --> 00:30:13,441
We won!

780
00:30:24,235 --> 00:30:25,220
Good game.

781
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:26,252
Good game.

782
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:40,261
Are you kidding me?

783
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:42,580
What's crack-a-lacka, y'all?

784
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:43,593
What's happening?

785
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:45,512
Eric didn't tell me
you guys were gonna be out here.

786
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:46,972
What's the occasion,
how you guys doin'?

787
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:48,143
Surprise!

788
00:30:49,408 --> 00:30:50,481
It's not my birthday.

789
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:53,312
We know it's not your birthday,
but we are here for a reason, QB.

790
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:54,931
And that reason is...

791
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:59,270
As a designated member of
the National Quad Rugby Squad,

792
00:30:59,397 --> 00:31:02,323
I am here to inform you that
you have been invited

793
00:31:02,505 --> 00:31:04,491
to training camp in Austin.

794
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:07,682
No way.

795
00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:10,283
No way.

796
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:12,721
Whoa, don't get so excited
there, young buck.

797
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:13,972
Training camp

798
00:31:14,387 --> 00:31:15,440
is two weeks

799
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:17,482
of the most intense,

800
00:31:17,857 --> 00:31:19,413
painful, exhausting

801
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:21,690
workouts of your young,
wheelchair-bound life.

802
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,220
And at the end
of that two weeks,

803
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:25,893
coaches evaluate the players.

804
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:27,871
Then choose the new members

805
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:30,262
for the National
Quad Rugby Squad

806
00:31:30,475 --> 00:31:32,270
for the U.S. of A.

807
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:35,042
I--I don't know what to say.
I mean,

808
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:36,091
you think I got a shot?

809
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:37,412
Uhh...no.

810
00:31:37,858 --> 00:31:39,521
Like a snowball's chance in...

811
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:42,300
But, I'll tell you what,
we got four open spots.

812
00:31:42,836 --> 00:31:44,000
You make one of 'em,

813
00:31:44,218 --> 00:31:45,600
we're Beijing-bound.

814
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:47,580
- That's China.
- That is China.

815
00:31:47,596 --> 00:31:49,820
Can you say chopsticks
and hot chicks?

816
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:51,191
Yes, I can.

817
00:31:51,486 --> 00:31:52,730
Yes, I can.

818
00:31:52,888 --> 00:31:55,200
But now, you said
my credit score was fine.

819
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:56,511
I'm sorry, Ms. Williams.

820
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:59,570
But I did tell you a pre-approved loan
isn't always guaranteed.

821
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,271
Oh, yeah, it wouldn't have
anything to do

822
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:02,782
with me being single parent

823
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,611
or that little box
on the application

824
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:06,630
where you had me
to check off my race.

825
00:32:06,777 --> 00:32:07,873
No, no, that's

826
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:09,042
federal monitoring

827
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,631
to prevent racial bias.

828
00:32:10,817 --> 00:32:12,782
Oh, it worked like a charm,
didn't it?

829
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,240
We want to talk
to your supervisor.

830
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:16,051
It won't make a difference.

831
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,041
Well, let's do it anyway.

832
00:32:19,595 --> 00:32:20,981
I can leave him a message.

833
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:23,800
- We're here right now.
- I'm sorry, it's not possible.

834
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:25,160
Let's go, Brian.

835
00:32:25,327 --> 00:32:26,800
No, Mama, they can't do this.

836
00:32:26,997 --> 00:32:28,401
They can't just
take back the loan.

837
00:32:28,407 --> 00:32:29,380
Oh, there will be other loans.

838
00:32:29,455 --> 00:32:31,443
No, we want to talk
to your boss now!

839
00:32:32,436 --> 00:32:34,163
It's not gonna do anybody
any good to get crazy.

840
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:35,261
Look around you.

841
00:32:35,926 --> 00:32:37,453
Look at all these eyes on you.

842
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:39,160
Lookin' at you.

843
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:39,902
Waitin'.

844
00:32:40,117 --> 00:32:41,971
Expecting you
to do something violent.

845
00:32:42,075 --> 00:32:45,190
Become that junkyard dog
of Mac McGill's, uh-uh.

846
00:32:46,078 --> 00:32:47,300
Don't give 'em that.

847
00:32:48,036 --> 00:32:49,772
You ladies
have a good afternoon.

848
00:32:53,788 --> 00:32:55,023
Thank you very much.

849
00:33:06,947 --> 00:33:08,051
- Hey.
- Hey.

850
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:09,482
How's my QB one?

851
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:10,792
Hi.

852
00:33:11,546 --> 00:33:12,563
- How you doin'?
- Good.

853
00:33:12,587 --> 00:33:13,860
Can I ask you a question?

854
00:33:14,566 --> 00:33:15,641
Well the answer is "yes."

855
00:33:15,726 --> 00:33:17,821
You do look super-hot

856
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:20,111
- in my football jersey.
- No, umm...

857
00:33:23,396 --> 00:33:25,111
Do you think
I'm a spoiled snob?

858
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,851
- I'm serious.
- Where'd that come from?

859
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:30,013
Answer the question.

860
00:33:34,865 --> 00:33:35,520
A little.

861
00:33:37,568 --> 00:33:39,690
A litt--I'm--
I'm kidding.

862
00:33:41,098 --> 00:33:42,563
Someone say something to you?

863
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:45,330
Want me to go beat 'em up?

864
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:49,181
Well, I gotta tell you
what happened to me today.

865
00:33:49,186 --> 00:33:50,941
- Yeah, I know--
- I got invited to Nationals.

866
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:53,323
- What Nationals?
- Nationals. Quad Rugby

867
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:54,300
National Team

868
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:56,231
is having tryouts
in Austin for a couple of weeks

869
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:57,582
- and they got four spots open.
- Austin?

870
00:33:57,638 --> 00:33:58,942
And if I go
and I make the team,

871
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:01,323
then I'll possibly be going
to Beijing later this year.

872
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:03,893
What does that mean?
What about--

873
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:05,962
What about our plans?
What about school?

874
00:34:06,276 --> 00:34:07,640
School was a mistake.

875
00:34:09,326 --> 00:34:09,982
It wasn't--

876
00:34:10,106 --> 00:34:11,942
- School was a mistake?
- It's not--

877
00:34:12,507 --> 00:34:13,531
School's not a mistake.

878
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:15,371
Fitting in was a mistake.

879
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:17,482
- You fit in fine, Jason.
- No, I don't fit in fine.

880
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,553
And even if I did fit in,
I don't want to.

881
00:34:19,598 --> 00:34:21,061
This is going backwards,
I wanna move forward.

882
00:34:21,138 --> 00:34:23,133
I wanna go later this month
and get my GED.

883
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:24,563
- And bam, be done with school.
- Your GED?

884
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,132
Yeah, my GED.
I'm this close.

885
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:27,582
I'm this close, Lyla.

886
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:31,853
Me going to Austin
for just a couple weeks

887
00:34:32,115 --> 00:34:33,262
doesn't change anything.

888
00:34:35,997 --> 00:34:38,262
We're just here to--
to have an opportunity

889
00:34:38,265 --> 00:34:40,001
to talk about race relations

890
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:42,393
at this school and what's been
going on this week,

891
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:44,293
and air your feelings, and

892
00:34:44,597 --> 00:34:45,681
and have people listen to you.

893
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:46,982
So who wants to go first?

894
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:47,843
Ms. Tami.

895
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:48,672
Anton.

896
00:34:48,697 --> 00:34:49,733
I got something to say.

897
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:51,492
I mean,

898
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:54,833
when it comes to,
like, whites and blacks,

899
00:34:55,316 --> 00:34:57,063
man, we just--
we just different.

900
00:34:57,148 --> 00:34:58,563
That's a gross generalization.

901
00:34:58,606 --> 00:35:00,050
Dog, no, it's not, fool.

902
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:01,720
Stereotypes happen
for a reason.

903
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:03,153
Hey, this is not a debate.

904
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:04,311
Just so we're clear.

905
00:35:04,446 --> 00:35:06,421
This is just a chance
for everybody to talk

906
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:07,461
and listen.

907
00:35:07,578 --> 00:35:08,741
So if you wanna speak,

908
00:35:08,746 --> 00:35:10,873
you can hold up your hand.
Let's let Anton finish.

909
00:35:11,036 --> 00:35:12,010
Like I was saying,

910
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,722
if you look at who's with who,

911
00:35:13,766 --> 00:35:15,010
you know, in the lunch room

912
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:16,951
or, you know what I'm saying,
after school.

913
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:18,932
At the end of the day,

914
00:35:19,337 --> 00:35:20,610
we just naturally

915
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,650
go with our own.

916
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,082
I mean, that's just how it is.
I mean, that's all I'm saying.

917
00:35:24,086 --> 00:35:25,651
All right.
All right.

918
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:27,182
Landry.

919
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,561
I mean, I think a lot of it has

920
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:30,982
to do with how we're socialized.

921
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:32,981
If that makes any sense.
I mean, um

922
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:34,512
science says that my DNA

923
00:35:34,517 --> 00:35:36,050
could be closer to that of a

924
00:35:36,055 --> 00:35:37,593
black person in Kenya

925
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,281
I suppose that

926
00:35:39,396 --> 00:35:41,230
I don't know, the white
person sitting next to me.

927
00:35:41,446 --> 00:35:42,771
That's interesting.

928
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:44,362
Waverly.

929
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:45,770
Let's face it, you guys,

930
00:35:45,786 --> 00:35:47,502
people say things like Mac said

931
00:35:47,715 --> 00:35:49,271
all the time and worse.

932
00:35:49,665 --> 00:35:51,190
But the real problem is

933
00:35:51,476 --> 00:35:53,160
people just refuse
to acknowledge that racism

934
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:54,431
even exists in Dillon.

935
00:35:54,536 --> 00:35:56,151
So we need to have more
forums like this,

936
00:35:56,157 --> 00:35:57,470
- we need to talk about it.
- Don't get your panties in a wad, Waverly.

937
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:59,420
It's not like this is
a big conspiracy.

938
00:36:00,345 --> 00:36:01,521
It is not like being white

939
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:03,010
gives you the right
to interrupt either.

940
00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:03,431
Thank you.

941
00:36:03,435 --> 00:36:04,791
And it's not like we're
at a movie theater.

942
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:05,253
Hey, hey, hey,

943
00:36:05,258 --> 00:36:06,372
quiet down, y'all.

944
00:36:06,378 --> 00:36:07,523
Man, what you trying to say,
Thompson?

945
00:36:07,527 --> 00:36:08,433
He's trying to say
that I can't even

946
00:36:08,438 --> 00:36:09,081
go to a movie anymore

947
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:10,302
to a decent movie
without some black person

948
00:36:10,308 --> 00:36:11,933
in front of me yelling
and talking all the time.

949
00:36:11,935 --> 00:36:12,931
Sit down, please.

950
00:36:13,777 --> 00:36:17,113
Why don't you keep your dumbass,
ignorant, racist comments--

951
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:18,901
Guys! Guys!
Stop it!

952
00:36:20,266 --> 00:36:21,952
Guys! Guys!
Stop it!

953
00:36:39,748 --> 00:36:40,783
Hey, Mac

954
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:42,862
What you're doing
here so late?

955
00:36:43,337 --> 00:36:44,953
We never got a chance to talk.

956
00:36:45,258 --> 00:36:46,052
About what?

957
00:36:46,376 --> 00:36:47,842
Well, about what you said,

958
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:50,013
and how you may or may not
perceive the black players--

959
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:51,230
What I perceive

960
00:36:51,438 --> 00:36:52,553
other than football

961
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:53,732
is none of your business.

962
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:55,993
Whoa, look, I'm just trying
to have a dialogue.

963
00:36:56,226 --> 00:36:58,211
Well, you save your dialoguin'
for your mommy.

964
00:36:58,678 --> 00:37:00,003
Now, wait a minute,
you said--

965
00:37:00,008 --> 00:37:01,191
No, you wait a minute, son.

966
00:37:01,507 --> 00:37:02,721
You wait just a minute.

967
00:37:03,447 --> 00:37:05,081
I've been here
for 27 years.

968
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,810
And I am not about
to be interrogated by some

969
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:09,961
too-big-for-his-britches
teenager, you got me?

970
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:11,982
What the hell you mean,
too-big-for-my-britches, Mac?

971
00:37:12,216 --> 00:37:12,822
You don't wanna see--

972
00:37:12,827 --> 00:37:14,242
This is done, all right?
This is over.

973
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:16,301
I'm done with this.
I am done.

974
00:37:16,455 --> 00:37:17,262
Look,

975
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:19,160
if I hear you whining,

976
00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:21,603
or anybody else whining
about this anymore,

977
00:37:21,997 --> 00:37:23,882
you're gonna be warming your ass
on the bench Friday night,

978
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:25,512
- you got me?
- Oh, no, you can't do that.

979
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:26,701
Oh, I can.

980
00:37:27,106 --> 00:37:27,771
Yeah.

981
00:37:28,195 --> 00:37:29,703
And I will.

982
00:37:35,528 --> 00:37:36,862
I'm tired of this crap.

983
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:48,861
Hey, babe.

984
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,252
Hey.

985
00:38:08,388 --> 00:38:10,952
Well, it didn't go very well,
honey.

986
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:19,840
I mean, first of all,
hardly anybody showed up.

987
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:24,750
But then, I mean,
I wish you could--

988
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:29,012
I wish you coulda seen the way
these kids were yelling at each other.

989
00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:32,581
Calling each other names.

990
00:38:39,098 --> 00:38:41,142
It's real hard
to make a change around here.

991
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:50,130
You know you're an example
to aspire to, don't you?

992
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:54,811
You gave them an opportunity
to express themselves

993
00:38:54,817 --> 00:38:57,273
that they wouldn't have
otherwise, you know that.

994
00:38:57,495 --> 00:38:59,953
Because you're always there
ready to listen to them.

995
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:05,152
You never shy away
from difficult subjects.

996
00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:07,752
They know they can trust you.

997
00:39:11,025 --> 00:39:12,283
That's a rarity.

998
00:39:21,506 --> 00:39:23,361
You're my wife,

999
00:39:23,537 --> 00:39:25,520
and I am damn proud of you.

1000
00:39:25,827 --> 00:39:26,801
Come here.

1001
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:29,233
Oh, come here, come here,
come here, come here.

1002
00:40:43,947 --> 00:40:45,172
Hey, Smash.

1003
00:40:45,706 --> 00:40:46,702
Matt.

1004
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:48,000
So, I--

1005
00:40:48,247 --> 00:40:49,932
I heard that forum
was kinda crazy.

1006
00:40:50,218 --> 00:40:51,162
I heard.

1007
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:53,003
Look, I was thinking
that maybe we should

1008
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:54,353
- get the team together--
- No disrespect,

1009
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:56,141
but I'm really not in the mood
for chatting right now.

1010
00:40:57,836 --> 00:40:59,422
Let's go, gentlemen.
Let's go.

1011
00:40:59,808 --> 00:41:02,083
Got a lot of work to do today.
A lot of work.

1012
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:04,052
Everybody feelin' good today?

1013
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:05,580
I can't hear you.

1014
00:41:05,878 --> 00:41:08,032
All right, I like to hear that.
Mac, let's call it.

1015
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:10,430
All right, you heard the man.
Let's go, get on the line.

1016
00:41:10,825 --> 00:41:12,040
Stride it out.

1017
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:14,720
On my whistle.

1018
00:41:28,077 --> 00:41:30,663
You boys deaf or something?
I said on my whistle!

1019
00:41:30,727 --> 00:41:31,733
Ready!

1020
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,662
I'm not gonna tell you again.

1021
00:41:43,138 --> 00:41:45,662
Get your asses down there.
On my whistle!
