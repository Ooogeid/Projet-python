1
00:00:00,338 --> 00:00:01,338
<i>Sports Illustrated has this team</i>

2
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:03,291
<i>as the number one high school
football team in Texas.</i>

3
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:05,288
Got yourself a heck
of a quarterback.

4
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,138
He's a good boy.
Very proud of him.

5
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,704
Is it true, Mr. Street,
that--

6
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:09,607
That I love Lyla Garrity?

7
00:00:09,673 --> 00:00:11,940
Here's to God and football

8
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:13,673
and, ten years
from now, Street,

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,940
good friends livin' large
in Texas.

10
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:17,040
We feel fully prepared

11
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,005
to represent
this beloved community

12
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:20,049
this Friday night

13
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:21,078
and every Friday night.

14
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:23,171
You've earned this.
The right to win.

15
00:00:23,248 --> 00:00:24,812
<i>Street throws a wobble.</i>

16
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:25,603
Picked off by Chandler.

17
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,972
Street the only one
that can get to him.

18
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:30,053
Gigantic hit on Street.

19
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,183
A third-string quarterback.
Saracen!

20
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:34,981
No one's seen
this guy play.

21
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:36,231
Start throwing
the ball, son.

22
00:00:36,677 --> 00:00:37,422
<i>Dropping back to pass,</i>

23
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:39,341
and he throws the ball--
Oh, man.

24
00:00:39,597 --> 00:00:40,903
Man, can this kid
throw the ball.

25
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:43,543
Give all of us
the strength to remember

26
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:44,570
that what we have
is special.

27
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:47,000
That it can be taken
from us.

28
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:48,842
And that when it is,
we will be tested.

29
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:52,223
It is a blessing

30
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:53,502
to be in the house
of the Lord

31
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:54,560
amongst believers.

32
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:55,760
Amen.

33
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:57,133
We do know
that on Friday night,

34
00:00:57,135 --> 00:00:59,231
one of our brothers,
brother Jason,

35
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:02,562
was injured
in the football game.

36
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:03,602
The doctors are saying

37
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:05,580
that possible
he could be paralyzed.

38
00:01:05,677 --> 00:01:09,001
But we know of a doctor
who's greater

39
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:10,742
than any doctor.

40
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:12,743
Yes, yes.

41
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:17,042
I have prayed with Mitchell
and Joanne Street.

42
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:19,601
And as an entire
community,

43
00:01:19,677 --> 00:01:23,801
we have come together
in prayer and hope.

44
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:26,542
And faith

45
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:29,243
And with these prayers,
this faith,

46
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:32,403
this hope,
I believe Jason Street

47
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:36,243
will once again walk in
on his own two feet

48
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,691
and join
this congregation

49
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,990
and rejoice with us.

50
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,632
I saw that tackle,
little brother.

51
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:47,661
I saw him hit that turf.

52
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:50,063
Tell you what I think.

53
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:53,163
He's talking about wanting
to play football.

54
00:01:53,236 --> 00:01:54,762
He ain't ever
gonna walk again.

55
00:01:56,836 --> 00:01:58,362
And we know
he's gonna be fine.

56
00:01:58,436 --> 00:01:59,331
He's gonna walk again.

57
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:03,260
We're prayin' for him.

58
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,061
Best case scenario,
Jason's probably out

59
00:02:11,136 --> 00:02:12,462
for a month.

60
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:14,430
You know, it's probably
a lot longer than that.

61
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:19,260
But, uh, we need a plan
for Friday night.

62
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:20,533
Heck, we--

63
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:23,091
Heck, we need a--need a plan
for the rest of the season,

64
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,591
is what we need, Eric.

65
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:27,191
So tell me,

66
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:31,293
you think little Matt Saracen
can get it done?

67
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:39,320
I guess we're fixin'
to find out.

68
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:40,460
Yep.

69
00:02:40,465 --> 00:02:43,003
That was a nice sermon,
wasn't it?

70
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:45,061
Hey, Matt.

71
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:46,862
Come here.

72
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:50,802
How's it goin', Coach?

73
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:53,100
We got a lotta work
to do, son.

74
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:56,003
Yes sir.

75
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:50,603
Hey, Lyla.
Hi.

76
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:53,230
There he is.

77
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:54,260
How you doing?

78
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,762
Better now.

79
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,233
You ever hear
of Nathan Foreman?

80
00:03:58,306 --> 00:03:58,803
Who?

81
00:03:58,807 --> 00:03:59,743
Scuse me, doc.

82
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,821
Can you come help me
with this, please?

83
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:04,062
Just grab this side,
please.

84
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:05,362
Have you ever heard
of Nathan Foreman?

85
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:06,390
Uh, no.

86
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:08,092
I was on the Internet
last night

87
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,363
reading about this guy.

88
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:10,323
Had a terrible
spinal injury,

89
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:11,992
kinda like yours.

90
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:12,962
He now playing
varsity basketball

91
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:14,861
for UC San Diego.

92
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:16,062
I'm surprised
you never heard of this.

93
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,061
No, I'm--I'm oncology,
actually.

94
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:19,761
I'm just--
I was just passing.

95
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:20,893
Oh, right.

96
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:21,823
Well, can you hold this
up for me, please,

97
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:22,820
while I tape this?

98
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:23,860
Thanks.

99
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:24,861
Isn't this amazing?

100
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:26,463
The cheerleaders
and rally girls

101
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:29,420
have actually joined forces.

102
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:31,360
It's real nice.

103
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:32,462
Thanks so much.

104
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:33,660
You know, Nathan Foreman

105
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,320
missed one season,

106
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:36,691
and the NCAA voted
to give him

107
00:04:36,697 --> 00:04:38,622
an extra year
of eligibility.

108
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:44,620
Look at me, Jason.

109
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:48,291
Look at me.

110
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:50,791
This is gonna be okay.

111
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:52,120
Yeah.

112
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:53,660
Okay?

113
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:54,962
Okay.

114
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,060
I love you.

115
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,160
I love you, too.

116
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:03,591
<i> Well, there's no silver lining
to this one.</i>

117
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:06,613
<i> This is just a tragic blow
to the season,</i>

118
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:07,061
<i>any way you slice it.</i>

119
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,543
<i> Jason Street is the Panthers.</i>

120
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:11,543
<i> The team's been built
around him.</i>

121
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:15,242
<i>Now you've got this kid,
this 160-pound sophomore?</i>

122
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,443
<i> Matt Sorenson?</i>

123
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:17,713
They didn't even get
your name right.

124
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:18,673
<i> I think he just closed his eyes</i>

125
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:19,672
<i> and threw that ball.</i>

126
00:05:19,747 --> 00:05:20,970
<i> The kid comes in</i>

127
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:22,442
<i>with three minutes left
in the fourth quarter.</i>

128
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:23,970
<i> With that nd
of adrenaline rush,</i>

129
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:25,640
<i> anyone can throw
one nice pass.</i>

130
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,441
<i>Well, Hawk says you better</i>

131
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:29,910
<i>go to church
and do a little prayin.</i>

132
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:38,671
We're still waitin' to hear.

133
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:42,201
They got a specialist's
comin' in from Houston.

134
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:43,772
In the meantime,

135
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,250
it doesn't make any sense

136
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:47,940
and it does nobody any good

137
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:50,320
to make any predictions
one way or the other

138
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:51,533
until we get
the official word.

139
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:52,570
Understood?

140
00:05:52,638 --> 00:05:54,572
Yes, sir.

141
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:56,572
As far as football,

142
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:57,902
we got a game Friday.

143
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,100
We got a lotta work
to do.

144
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,205
Ready?

145
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:04,539
Break.

146
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:05,478
Let's go, one!

147
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:06,901
Number two!

148
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:08,101
Two, two, two,
two, two.

149
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:09,471
Set!

150
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,833
Blue, eight.

151
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:11,933
Blue, eight.

152
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:13,802
Hut!

153
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:16,330
Hit 'im deep!

154
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:17,902
Hit 'im deep.

155
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:18,931
Time!

156
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,031
Matt, you gotta throw
faster, son.

157
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:22,070
If Dolia's open
on the break,

158
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:23,533
you gotta hit him
on the break.

159
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:24,973
Sorry, Coach. I thought--
I don't want you
to say sorry.

160
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:26,071
I don't want you
thinkin' out here.

161
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:27,172
I want you to throw the ball.

162
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:29,362
Dolia runs deep,
hit him deep.

163
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:30,811
He's open on the break,
hit him on the break.

164
00:06:30,818 --> 00:06:32,113
You got four seconds
or a five-step drop, Matt!

165
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:34,471
All right, come on.
Let's do it again.

166
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:36,040
Go, go, go, go, go!

167
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:41,013
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

168
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:42,341
God's sakes, Matt!

169
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,642
Come here.

170
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:45,912
What happened?

171
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:47,443
I-I didn't see the linebacker.
You didn't what?

172
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:49,040
He's bigger than
my front door, Matt!

173
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:50,963
South Milbank
runs a five-three.

174
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:52,111
They're gonna drop
the linebackers.

175
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:52,990
We set up in the gun.
You got that?

176
00:06:53,155 --> 00:06:54,180
All right, Coach.

177
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:55,211
I gotta--I gotta work
on reading the cover--

178
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:56,511
You need to look
at the wide receiver

179
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:58,182
comin' underneath
the linebacker.
Yes, sir.

180
00:06:58,255 --> 00:07:00,250
Timing patterns.
Hit 'em on the breaks.

181
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:02,880
Hit them on the breaks
and play faster.
Yes, sir.

182
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,813
Hut!

183
00:07:07,555 --> 00:07:08,811
Saracen.

184
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,451
I need you to work
a little bit harder.

185
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:15,451
You need to learn
this offense, son.

186
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:17,250
You need to know
this offense

187
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:18,852
in your mind,
in your body.

188
00:07:18,915 --> 00:07:20,511
You need to know
this offense so well

189
00:07:20,588 --> 00:07:22,053
that your children
are gonna know this offense

190
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:23,050
in their own DNA.

191
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:24,013
Do you understand me?

192
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:24,983
You understand?

193
00:07:25,057 --> 00:07:26,551
Yes, sir.

194
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:27,881
All right.

195
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:29,182
Go on.

196
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:34,011
Okay, y'all, I'm outta here.

197
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,581
I'm telling you, you shouldn't
go to this book club, Mom.

198
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:36,711
They're just gonna turn you
into a pod.

199
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:39,091
I know.

200
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:40,271
I'm just gonna go
one time,

201
00:07:40,518 --> 00:07:42,681
show them my
literary prowess.

202
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:45,180
And then I'll be done
with it.

203
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:46,182
Hey, come here.

204
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:47,140
Come here.

205
00:08:03,387 --> 00:08:04,512
I love you.

206
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,341
I love you, too, babe.

207
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:48,280
To the girls' night.

208
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,643
Girls.
Cheers.

209
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:53,901
We are thrilled that you're here
with our book club.

210
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:55,140
Thank you.
I'm so excited to be here.

211
00:08:55,646 --> 00:08:56,641
I love the book.

212
00:08:56,715 --> 00:08:58,070
Oh, no.

213
00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:59,940
Oh, that's great.

214
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:01,540
We don't really
read the book.

215
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:02,910
Y'all didn't read the book?
We're just here to have fun.

216
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:05,740
Tell me, how's your husband
feeling about the team?

217
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:07,541
Exactly, let's talk
about what's important.

218
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:09,472
He's--he lo--
he's, um--

219
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:10,671
excited about the team.

220
00:09:10,748 --> 00:09:11,713
Well, you know,
are you sure?

221
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:13,272
Listen.

222
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,140
He should play
my Robbie D. more.
What he should be doin'--

223
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:16,842
He should be
running more dives

224
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,140
than counters straight ahead.

225
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:20,140
Do you have any idea
what his plans are for Robbie?

226
00:09:20,217 --> 00:09:21,373
I don't.
Smash-mouth football.

227
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:22,840
Smash-mouth football.

228
00:09:22,915 --> 00:09:24,412
Three yards
and a cloud of dust.

229
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:25,571
This boy is ready
to rumble.

230
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:28,442
So look,
you got my math homework?

231
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:29,911
Where is it?
At my home.

232
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:32,413
I gotta come to your house
and pick it up, huh?

233
00:09:32,478 --> 00:09:33,612
Well, you gonna be there?

234
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:35,471
Of course.
Okay, all righty.

235
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:36,871
All righty.

236
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:38,411
Can't believe it.

237
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,072
Just three days ago,
we were right here.

238
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:46,730
Jason Street was literally
sitting right over there.

239
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:48,031
Could they be more annoying?

240
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:49,430
I mean, seriously.

241
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,931
Hey.

242
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:52,830
Hey, yeah, you.

243
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:54,303
You don't even know
Jason Street.

244
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:55,332
So stop crying.

245
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:58,773
Okay, no.
Seriously, stop.

246
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:06,373
So.

247
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:07,563
Just how drunk
are you right now?

248
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:09,001
Look, we can't--

249
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,801
we can't just sit around
and cry about it.

250
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,602
Somebody's gotta
take control.

251
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,200
You know, like when one person
drops the ball,

252
00:10:14,277 --> 00:10:16,173
somebody's gotta jump
on the fumble.

253
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:18,072
You pointin' at me.
That's me, right?

254
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,202
That's you, man.

255
00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:20,773
That's me, baby.
I know what I gotta do.

256
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:22,071
We can't afford
to lose this.

257
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:23,801
This is ours.
I wanna get to state.

258
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,932
Hey, Matt.

259
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:27,900
So, I'm yours.

260
00:10:29,037 --> 00:10:30,571
S-sorry?

261
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:31,900
Well, now that you're
first string,

262
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:33,471
you get a first string
rally girl.

263
00:10:33,538 --> 00:10:35,532
So the way this
usually works is

264
00:10:35,607 --> 00:10:36,862
you tell me
what you like,

265
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:38,503
and I'll provide it.

266
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:39,531
What do you like, Matt?

267
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,501
Uh, I don't--

268
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:42,601
I like, um--

269
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:43,932
I make a mean
chocolate coconut cake.

270
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:45,471
Made with real butter.

271
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:47,131
Well, that's--
that sounds--

272
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:48,300
Tell you what.

273
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:49,730
Why don't you try it,
see what you think,

274
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:50,731
and we'll go from there.

275
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:52,403
Yeah, that sounds good.

276
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:57,701
Okay, can we just pause
for a second

277
00:10:57,765 --> 00:11:01,203
and reflect on the
implications of this?

278
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:02,532
No, no, no.
I can--no.

279
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:04,130
I can't think
about girls right now.

280
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:05,703
'Cause I got
a big game on Friday, so--

281
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,170
I mean, this is it.

282
00:11:07,178 --> 00:11:08,831
We gotta seize
our opportunity.

283
00:11:09,255 --> 00:11:10,421
I mean, you're QB1 now.

284
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:11,522
You know, me and you.
Me and you?

285
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:13,290
What do you even have
to do with it?

286
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,792
Besides, it doesn't seem right
with Jason sittin' there

287
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:17,661
in that hospital,
just layin' there and all.

288
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:19,621
Well, maybe it's not right,
but it's what we got.

289
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:20,720
You know?

290
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:22,661
Four or five weeks,
he's back on the team.

291
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:24,462
You're second string again.

292
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:26,292
You know, the rally girls,
they pack up their little tent

293
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:27,791
and they move
right down the road.

294
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:28,950
You think this team
needs a leader?

295
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:31,340
Yeah, it does, man.

296
00:11:31,347 --> 00:11:32,300
Look no further.

297
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:34,640
I'm gonna lead this team.

298
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,170
I know what I gotta do.

299
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:37,702
Y'all gonna be wit' me?

300
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:39,702
I'm gonna take us
straight to state.

301
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:41,270
Just because Street
went down

302
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:42,471
don't mean we just
stop playin'.

303
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:43,473
Look.

304
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:44,542
Everybody get behind
the Smash,

305
00:11:44,606 --> 00:11:46,910
and we won't miss
a beat, baby.

306
00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:48,673
Tim, no.

307
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:51,440
Sit down.
Don't do this.

308
00:11:51,506 --> 00:11:53,042
I'm sayin' we need to hit
the weight room tomorrow hard.

309
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:54,972
You gotta step it up.

310
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:56,170
Look, you gotta run
your rocks.

311
00:11:56,246 --> 00:11:58,142
Hey, wassup, Rig?

312
00:11:58,216 --> 00:11:59,211
Get up.

313
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:00,842
What?

314
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,012
You're sittin'
in Street's booth.

315
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:03,173
Get up.

316
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:04,640
Look, what you talkin'
'bout, man?

317
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:06,341
You heard what I said.

318
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:09,771
Why don't you go home

319
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:11,771
and sleep it off, Rig?

320
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:13,941
Be on time at practice
for a change.

321
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:31,971
You're right.

322
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:38,442
You guys enjoy the rest
of your evening, okay?

323
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:43,700
Hey, smile, Rig.

324
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:45,840
God don't like ugly.

325
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:48,942
Man, what's wrong with you?

326
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:50,241
No, no.

327
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:51,301
What's the matter with you?

328
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:53,510
Go on, Riggins!

329
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,610
No, I think it's a great case.

330
00:12:57,616 --> 00:12:59,491
Well, sure.

331
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:03,163
I'd love to help out.

332
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,200
All right i can do that

333
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,680
Rice Krispie Treats?

334
00:13:12,446 --> 00:13:14,432
No, I th--I--
Rice Krisp Treats are great,

335
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:15,831
and I do prefer 'em
with the M and Ms in.

336
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,232
Yeah.

337
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:20,071
I'll probably just make 'em
out of a box.

338
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:22,631
Oh, that many?
It's broken.

339
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:24,233
Okay.

340
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:25,790
I would be happy
to do that, sure.

341
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,960
All right, and thank you
so much again for last night.

342
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:29,131
It was just wonderful.

343
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:30,191
Okay.

344
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,161
I'll talk to you later.

345
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:32,363
Bye!

346
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,960
I swear, I've gotta make
200 Rice Krispie Treats

347
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:35,552
by Saturday.

348
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:37,332
Went to that book club
meeting last night.

349
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:38,502
I'm on 12 committees now.

350
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:40,332
Told you.
It's a slippery slope.

351
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:43,071
How's the AC?

352
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,300
It's broken.
You were right.

353
00:13:45,377 --> 00:13:46,473
Call the guy.
I'm sorry.

354
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:47,801
Sugar?

355
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:51,131
I think it's time
for me to get a job.

356
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,330
I mean,
we talked about it.

357
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:54,270
We're settled.

358
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:55,831
I think it's all right.

359
00:13:55,906 --> 00:13:57,003
You gonna do it now?

360
00:13:57,077 --> 00:13:58,732
Yeah, I think now.

361
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,101
I'm gonna put out some feelers,
all right?

362
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:03,501
All right.

363
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:06,272
All right.
That's great.

364
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:07,433
Nothin' you need
to worry about.

365
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:10,901
Now, those boys,

366
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:12,672
those boys
have always been weak

367
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:13,322
against the run.

368
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,002
And this year
is no different.

369
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:17,771
They cannot defend
against the ground game.

370
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:18,743
Am I right, Rich?

371
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:19,842
That's exactly right.

372
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:21,202
So it's simple.

373
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,040
You give Smash the ball.

374
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:24,202
You let him do
his thing.

375
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:25,773
Yeah, and don't let Saracen
throw the ball.

376
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:27,502
I know.

377
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,473
We don't want
any more of our boys

378
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:30,940
beaned in the helmet.

379
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:32,273
That was funny.

380
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:34,241
That boy can not
do the job.

381
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,841
I mean, you can't just--

382
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:37,401
You can't just sit back
and close your eyes

383
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:38,441
and expect miracles
to happen

384
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:39,503
every time you throw
the football.

385
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:40,500
Just ain't gonna happen.

386
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:41,970
That boy will lose
us ball games.

387
00:14:42,045 --> 00:14:43,303
Hey, now.

388
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:46,071
Ease off on all these pearls
of football wisdom

389
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:49,761
down there, and let Eric
finish his riblets.

390
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:51,640
That's right.

391
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:52,980
He's right.

392
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:54,901
Uh-huh, because,
I mean,

393
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:57,330
he knows what it takes
on Friday night.

394
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:58,363
That's right.

395
00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:00,460
A big ol' W.

396
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:04,603
You know,
I just wanna say...

397
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:06,631
I'm gonna keep
all this in mind.

398
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:09,710
And thank you very much
for this meal.

399
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:11,203
This is a fantastic meal.

400
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:12,712
Oh, it's our pleasure.
Fantastic meal.

401
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:16,271
Ball, ball!

402
00:15:16,345 --> 00:15:17,271
Aww.

403
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:18,942
Oh, for God's sakes,
Matt!

404
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:21,923
Watch the way
you throw the ball!

405
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:23,992
Don't you think we oughta start
focusing on our ground game?

406
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:25,722
We give this kid too much
to think about,

407
00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:27,491
he's gonna fall apart
in front of our eyes.

408
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:28,891
Big time.

409
00:15:28,957 --> 00:15:29,953
Let's go!
Thanks, Coach.

410
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,551
I'll run the practice today.

411
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:33,652
I right power 26.

412
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:36,723
Hut!

413
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:42,453
Hit somebody!

414
00:15:42,528 --> 00:15:43,953
What's going on
over there, Coach?

415
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:46,851
I seen my granddaddy make
better blocks playing checkers.

416
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:48,451
Yeah, if you could run
as fast as you talk,

417
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:49,790
we'd probably score
every play.

418
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:51,993
Look, you got some--you got
somethin' to say to me?

419
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:53,223
You need to start gettin'
behind my blocks,

420
00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:54,491
right behind me.

421
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:56,693
I can't keep doin' all this.
And you need to quit--

422
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:00,822
Hey, what's wrong
with you guys?

423
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,151
What the hell you doin'?

424
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:10,600
Knock it off.

425
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:12,273
Hey, get outta here!

426
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,203
South side of Dillon,
baby, for real!

427
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:30,843
Hey, Smash.

428
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,802
Hey.

429
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,172
Look.

430
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,802
Your boyfriend's
a real piece of work.

431
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:39,761
Well, at the moment,
I wouldn't really

432
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:42,830
call him my boyfriend.

433
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:51,102
Why are you
empty-handed, girl?

434
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:52,402
G'on back there and get
some bags outta that car.

435
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:54,202
You know I'm not supposed
to put stress on my back.

436
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:55,672
Why me?

437
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:56,972
So you're not around
to get the back of my hand

438
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:58,003
is why.

439
00:16:58,075 --> 00:16:59,273
Brian never has
to do anything.

440
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:00,232
Brian,
turn down that junk!

441
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:01,473
That's not music.

442
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:03,371
It's the devil's work,
is what it is.

443
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:09,003
Have you lost your mind?

444
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,403
You must be Mrs. Williams.

445
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:13,733
Yes, I am.

446
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:14,903
Messin' with white girls

447
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:17,373
after gettin' in a fight
at practice.

448
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:19,633
You're comin' with me.

449
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:22,953
Move.

450
00:17:23,716 --> 00:17:24,941
This to get back
at Tim Riggins?

451
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:25,691
What are you,
a shrink?

452
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:27,372
Oh, I'd be nice.

453
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,813
I work at Planned Parenthood.

454
00:17:28,878 --> 00:17:30,443
You probably haven't seen
the last of me.

455
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:31,670
Hey, I know how
to use protection.

456
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:32,970
I'm not some piece
of trash.

457
00:17:33,046 --> 00:17:34,873
Oh, no, you a class act
all the way.

458
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:36,212
What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?

459
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:38,871
It means you're safe
to walk from here.

460
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,843
Come on.

461
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:53,763
Come on.

462
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:04,491
Hey.

463
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:07,303
Hey, Coach.

464
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:12,611
How you feelin'?

465
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:17,112
Well, I'm, uh...

466
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:19,072
not really feelin'
too much...

467
00:18:19,146 --> 00:18:20,211
right now.

468
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:25,442
I, uh--

469
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:27,542
The guys.

470
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,632
All the guys signed it
up for ya.

471
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,613
Oh, yeah.

472
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:38,480
They all say hello.

473
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:40,092
Did Riggins sign that?

474
00:18:40,096 --> 00:18:41,382
Riggins signed.
Everyone signed it.

475
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,561
Huh.

476
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,323
When'd you teach him how
to write his name?

477
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:49,122
Well, he scrawled on there.
He didn't really--

478
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:53,153
Well, that's really nice,
Coach.

479
00:18:53,228 --> 00:18:55,812
Here, I'm gonna just
set it down here.

480
00:18:55,888 --> 00:18:56,853
Thank you.

481
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:03,880
Damn, son.

482
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,082
Look, I don't think anyone
needs to tell you,

483
00:19:12,157 --> 00:19:15,521
but you know we're savin'
your spot over there.

484
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:18,650
You know whatever
it takes,

485
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,123
however long it takes--

486
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,551
Yeah.

487
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:24,082
We, uh--

488
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:26,753
How's, uh--

489
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:27,923
how's Saracen doin'?

490
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:32,382
Saracen's doin' fine.

491
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:36,050
He's throwin' like a girl,
but he's doin' fine.

492
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:38,020
He's doin' fine.
It'll take some time.

493
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:42,250
Well, uh--

494
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:45,683
You know,
when I was--

495
00:19:45,757 --> 00:19:48,752
when I was kinda
like that kid?

496
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:50,120
You know?

497
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,652
I don't know.
He's a lot different.

498
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:56,480
He doesn't need it real bad,
like I do, I think.

499
00:19:58,047 --> 00:19:59,003
He's kinda creative.

500
00:19:59,505 --> 00:20:00,771
You know?

501
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:08,400
Listens to Bob Dylan
and draws pictures and...stuff.

502
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:10,963
I don't know.
He's a--

503
00:20:11,037 --> 00:20:13,030
He's a good kid, I think.

504
00:20:13,105 --> 00:20:14,461
You free him up
a little bit

505
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:16,233
out there on that field,
he'll, uh--

506
00:20:16,306 --> 00:20:20,401
he'll make some things
happen for you.

507
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:28,060
You're a good man.

508
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:29,762
You're a good man.

509
00:20:33,337 --> 00:20:35,560
You're what makes guys like me
wanna coach.

510
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:39,431
You are a good man.

511
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:42,001
Thank you.

512
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:45,333
I'm sorry if I--

513
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:48,800
sorry if I let you down.

514
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,300
Let the team down.

515
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:55,461
Damn, son.

516
00:20:55,536 --> 00:20:58,301
You didn't let me down.

517
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:01,630
You did not let me down.

518
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:13,482
You know, the problem is,

519
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:15,883
is that they keep comparing you
to Jason Street.

520
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:16,940
Know what I mean?
That's like--

521
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:18,910
That's like comparin'
my music

522
00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:21,632
to the Red Hot Chili Peppers
or something.

523
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:24,030
I mean, I'm not--I'm not
the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

524
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:25,331
I mean--I mean,
I'm my own thing.

525
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:26,461
I'm not any better
or any worse.

526
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:27,630
It's just different.

527
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:30,401
No, you're definitely
a whole lot worse.

528
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:31,661
Okay, well,
that's not the point, all right?

529
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:33,102
The point is,
you gotta learn

530
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,531
how to work the media.

531
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:37,102
You know, let them know
who Matt Saracen is.

532
00:21:37,168 --> 00:21:38,763
I mean, right now,
the bitches can't even get

533
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:39,830
your name right.

534
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:41,403
All right, well,
who is Matt Saracen?

535
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,362
Who is Matt Saracen?

536
00:21:42,438 --> 00:21:44,102
Matt Saracen is QB1.

537
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:46,963
And when the cameras
start rollin',

538
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,431
just start spewin' stuff out.

539
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:52,162
You know what I mean?
I mean...

540
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:53,202
just be out there.

541
00:21:53,265 --> 00:21:56,360
The weirder you are,
the better, really.

542
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:59,000
Not everyone's gonna be
the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

543
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,153
I mean...

544
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:03,633
Jason Street
is a great guy.

545
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,941
And everyone knows
what he's all about.

546
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:09,110
So he's like--he's like
the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

547
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:11,573
Um, but--
and everyone likes that,

548
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:14,411
and that's good,
but that's not me.

549
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:16,671
Well, if Jason Street
is the Red Hot Chili Peppers,

550
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:18,772
who are you?

551
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:20,442
Uh--

552
00:22:20,517 --> 00:22:22,001
Exactly.

553
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:23,671
I mean, who am I?

554
00:22:23,747 --> 00:22:25,642
Who--who am I?

555
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,843
Big G, little O.

556
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:30,941
Go, go!

557
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:31,840
Sharp arms!

558
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:35,692
Big G, little O.
Go, go!

559
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:36,313
Last time.

560
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:39,230
Big G, little O.
Go, go.

561
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:40,241
Hey, Tim.

562
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:43,800
Tim.

563
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:45,532
Hey.
Hey.

564
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:47,562
How you doin'
with all this?

565
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:48,801
Well, you know.

566
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,830
Yeah.

567
00:22:50,926 --> 00:22:52,482
Look, I know you're not
a chatterbox

568
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:53,543
when it comes
to your feelings,

569
00:22:53,548 --> 00:22:56,740
but I'm here.

570
00:22:56,745 --> 00:22:59,301
Yeah, cool.

571
00:23:00,168 --> 00:23:01,813
You know, Jason's been asking
about you.

572
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:03,460
Yeah.

573
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:05,503
How, uh--
how is J.?

574
00:23:05,505 --> 00:23:06,403
He's good.
He's good?

575
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:07,660
He's real good.

576
00:23:07,738 --> 00:23:08,662
He's still Jason.

577
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:11,760
I know.

578
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:16,163
I was gonna go over there
later, around 8:00.

579
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:19,022
Visiting hours are over
at 6:00,

580
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:20,821
but I kinda got
the place wired.

581
00:23:22,555 --> 00:23:23,620
You wanna come with?

582
00:23:27,226 --> 00:23:28,291
You know,
you wait too long,

583
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,891
he might start takin' it
personal, Tim.

584
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,993
The MRI shows damage
to the cord

585
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,520
at the C7-T1 junction.

586
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:41,122
It could be much worse.

587
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:43,652
Jason, you're fortunate
that the fracture

588
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,463
was low enough
that you'll still be able

589
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,962
to use your arms and hands.

590
00:23:56,865 --> 00:23:58,560
It's okay.

591
00:23:58,636 --> 00:23:59,520
What about my legs, doc?

592
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:01,580
Well, we'll just keep prayin'.

593
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:02,990
And then once you start
physical therapy--

594
00:24:02,995 --> 00:24:03,851
Ma.

595
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,341
Look, Dr. Kroll.

596
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:08,841
I just wanna know
if I'm gonna be able

597
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:09,841
to walk again.

598
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,311
Please.

599
00:24:12,136 --> 00:24:13,111
Look, I can take it.

600
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:17,073
All you gotta do
is tell me the truth.

601
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:21,803
Tami, Tami.
Hi!

602
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:22,931
Hey!
How are you?

603
00:24:23,006 --> 00:24:24,272
Good, how are you?
Good.

604
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,331
Good to see you
the other night.
You, too.

605
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:28,101
Y'all have a good dinner.
Okay, you, too.

606
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,403
Hey.

607
00:24:29,475 --> 00:24:31,133
I'm so sorry.

608
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:32,833
It's all right.

609
00:24:32,908 --> 00:24:33,930
It's all right.
I, uh--

610
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:36,133
I made a couple of dates
for next week,

611
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,001
one with a hog farmer
from Rio Tinto--

612
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,473
Hog farmer
from Rio Tinto.
Mm-hmm.

613
00:24:39,536 --> 00:24:40,672
That's a new one.
Where's my daughter?

614
00:24:40,735 --> 00:24:41,872
I've always liked
hog farmers.

615
00:24:41,937 --> 00:24:42,930
Your daughter is
at dance rehearsal,

616
00:24:43,006 --> 00:24:44,930
which I've told you about
20 times.

617
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:46,330
Oh.
How was your day?

618
00:24:46,407 --> 00:24:47,733
Um, my day--
my day--

619
00:24:47,808 --> 00:24:49,200
Sweetheart, would you take
your hat off

620
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:51,171
at the table, please?

621
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:52,200
You look so cute.

622
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:56,030
You go first.

623
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:57,630
Okay, you want the good news
or the bad news?

624
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,100
No, good news.
Always the good news.

625
00:24:59,177 --> 00:25:00,200
All right, I'll give you
the bad news.

626
00:25:00,276 --> 00:25:02,002
AC? Done.

627
00:25:02,076 --> 00:25:04,171
Like I said,
we need a new unit.

628
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:05,301
$3,000, minimum.

629
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:08,371
What's the good news?

630
00:25:08,438 --> 00:25:09,430
There a cold front
movin' in?

631
00:25:09,435 --> 00:25:10,903
No, the good news
is that

632
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,600
I think I might be able
to help you pay

633
00:25:12,608 --> 00:25:15,470
for the new unit 'cause I think
I got myself a job.

634
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:17,441
Really?
Mm-hmm.

635
00:25:18,495 --> 00:25:20,043
That fast, you got a job?

636
00:25:20,045 --> 00:25:21,443
Yeah.
Where'd you get the job?

637
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:23,912
I-I--at the school.

638
00:25:23,975 --> 00:25:25,512
What school?
At the high school.

639
00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:27,772
W--

640
00:25:27,848 --> 00:25:29,112
At my high school?

641
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:30,841
I wasn't aware
that you had bought it,

642
00:25:30,918 --> 00:25:32,212
but yeah.

643
00:25:32,276 --> 00:25:34,641
I'm the new guidance counselor
at the high school

644
00:25:36,546 --> 00:25:38,242
You know that
guidance counselors

645
00:25:38,315 --> 00:25:40,241
can be a nuisance,
and that means--
Eric.

646
00:25:40,317 --> 00:25:41,870
We're gonna have
some interaction, and--

647
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:43,642
Well, that's good.
Guidance counselors have
interaction.

648
00:25:43,715 --> 00:25:45,473
I think that's great that we're
gonna have some interaction.

649
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:47,343
Well, I just think that we--
we should probably talk about--

650
00:25:47,418 --> 00:25:49,170
Well, I've taken
the job already.

651
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:54,073
e, what happened
to the consultatn

652
00:25:54,147 --> 00:25:55,072
we were gonna have?

653
00:25:55,148 --> 00:25:56,070
Hello, Coach Taylor.

654
00:25:56,148 --> 00:25:57,340
Yeah.

655
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:00,010
Thank you.

656
00:26:00,076 --> 00:26:02,072
It's the hospital calling
about Jason.

657
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:09,373
Yeah.

658
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:11,613
Hi.

659
00:26:11,678 --> 00:26:12,711
Yep.

660
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:39,030
Uh--

661
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:45,613
Jason's paralyzed.

662
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:49,721
Uh...they say
with physical therapy,

663
00:26:49,787 --> 00:26:51,951
he'll regain use
of his arms, his hands,

664
00:26:52,016 --> 00:26:53,182
his upper body.

665
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:54,512
But they don't think
he's gonna regain

666
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:56,550
use of his legs.

667
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,822
Now, listen up.

668
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:03,881
Any of you need
to talk to me,

669
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:08,723
you'll find me
in my office.

670
00:27:08,786 --> 00:27:10,481
Or you call me
any time.

671
00:27:10,555 --> 00:27:13,723
Do not hesitate.

672
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:20,722
Now, that's all for today.

673
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:22,650
We'll--

674
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:23,780
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

675
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:34,473
Forever means

676
00:27:35,365 --> 00:27:40,781
Until the day I leave

677
00:27:41,797 --> 00:27:46,581
Out of sight
means out of mind

678
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:49,720
Okay, I right 44
lead bronco.

679
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:50,853
Uh, open right,

680
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:53,322
um--open right,

681
00:27:53,395 --> 00:27:55,151
draw to the tailback,

682
00:27:55,226 --> 00:27:56,491
off the right, uh, tackle.

683
00:27:56,556 --> 00:27:58,321
Okay, there you go.
You got one.

684
00:27:58,397 --> 00:28:00,391
Pro left, motion,
X-Y eagle.

685
00:28:00,455 --> 00:28:02,153
Uh, five-step drop,

686
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:04,650
X-receiver runs
the five yard out, um--

687
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,092
Uh--

688
00:28:06,157 --> 00:28:07,521
and the wide receiver
runs the button.

689
00:28:07,597 --> 00:28:08,890
Close.
The fullback releases.

690
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:10,653
The fullback releases
under the outside linebackers.

691
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:11,890
Damn it.

692
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:13,593
Why are you yellin' at me?
I'm not.

693
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:15,690
I mean, you only got,
like, 250 or so variations

694
00:28:15,758 --> 00:28:17,752
to go after this.

695
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:20,290
You gonna give me my fries
anytime soon?

696
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:22,393
Um, I'm sorry.

697
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:27,321
Sorry. Here.
Here, you can have a free drink.

698
00:28:27,397 --> 00:28:29,792
Sorry about the wait.
I'm sorry.

699
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:43,670
God.

700
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:46,691
Lyla.

701
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:50,851
I know, I should go.

702
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:53,560
I'll be back at 6:00, okay?

703
00:28:53,628 --> 00:28:54,921
That's not what I'm sayin'.

704
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:57,561
Uh--

705
00:28:57,626 --> 00:28:59,691
What?

706
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:01,962
We have to talk about this.

707
00:29:02,027 --> 00:29:03,193
All right?
About me.

708
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:06,912
I spoke to Dr. Kroll.
He didn't say it was impossible.

709
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:07,843
Lyla.

710
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:10,110
It would take a miracle

711
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:11,442
for me to walk again.

712
00:29:11,515 --> 00:29:12,910
I mean, it's just not
gonna happen.

713
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:15,180
You know what I think?

714
00:29:15,247 --> 00:29:18,240
I don't think Dr. Kroll
realizes who you are.

715
00:29:19,498 --> 00:29:20,460
We are gonna go out,

716
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:22,611
and we are gonna find
the best doctors out there.

717
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:23,090
That's what we're gonna do.

718
00:29:23,587 --> 00:29:24,580
Lyla, doctors don't--

719
00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:25,813
You are Jason Street.

720
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,181
And I am Lyla Garrity.

721
00:29:27,256 --> 00:29:28,650
And everything is gonna
work out

722
00:29:28,716 --> 00:29:30,152
just the way
we planned it.

723
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:42,050
Thank you, Lord,
for all that You have given

724
00:29:42,118 --> 00:29:44,313
to Jason and myself.

725
00:29:44,388 --> 00:29:46,410
We don't know yet
why You are putting us

726
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,280
through this test,

727
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:50,810
but I know that You'll find
a way to show us.

728
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:53,551
And we will pull
through this test.

729
00:29:53,618 --> 00:29:56,983
Whatever it takes.

730
00:29:57,058 --> 00:29:58,582
Amen.

731
00:29:59,856 --> 00:30:00,812
Amen.

732
00:30:02,485 --> 00:30:03,452
Amen.

733
00:30:19,058 --> 00:30:19,990
I saw you pullin' up.

734
00:30:19,997 --> 00:30:22,422
Mm-hmm.
Thought you might.

735
00:30:22,425 --> 00:30:23,462
What are you doin'?

736
00:30:23,527 --> 00:30:25,691
Field's empty.
Let's go make out.

737
00:30:29,757 --> 00:30:30,993
How you doin'?

738
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:34,822
Matt Saracen
isn't ready for this.

739
00:30:34,895 --> 00:30:36,991
Mm-hmm.

740
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:40,520
This--

741
00:30:40,597 --> 00:30:42,852
this town.

742
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:48,961
Oh, this town expects,
this town expects state.

743
00:30:49,835 --> 00:30:51,281
They expect
nothin' less, babe.

744
00:30:51,337 --> 00:30:52,303
I know.

745
00:30:52,378 --> 00:30:53,303
I tell you what.

746
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,030
Right now, I have no idea
whether or not

747
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,902
we can even win a game
and I'm serious

748
00:30:56,977 --> 00:30:59,502
when I say that.

749
00:30:59,577 --> 00:31:02,002
Yeah, well...

750
00:31:04,578 --> 00:31:06,901
I know what you're
gonna do.

751
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:09,670
I know that you're
gonna mold that boy.

752
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:11,201
You are gonna mold
Matt Saracen,

753
00:31:11,276 --> 00:31:13,732
same way you did
with Jason Street.

754
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:15,670
You did it with Jeff Perell
back in Macedonia.

755
00:31:15,737 --> 00:31:18,031
You took that kid in.

756
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:20,331
I mean, he didn't know
the difference

757
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:23,123
between a skinny post
and an out-and-up.

758
00:31:23,135 --> 00:31:25,062
You made him
the best quarterback

759
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:25,503
in the league.

760
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:27,030
You did that.

761
00:31:27,097 --> 00:31:28,333
Yeah, well, I also had
close to a year

762
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:28,920
to get him ready.

763
00:31:28,936 --> 00:31:30,462
This is a little bit different. I--
Well?

764
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:32,190
I got no time here.
I got no time.

765
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:33,763
I lose a game,
I'm on the road.

766
00:31:33,838 --> 00:31:35,890
I lose a couple more,
we're packin' our bags.

767
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:36,963
And I tell you what.

768
00:31:37,026 --> 00:31:39,530
What they say, it's right.

769
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:40,890
I mean, I--

770
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,932
Jason Street,
he was my meal ticket.

771
00:31:42,995 --> 00:31:44,861
He's the only reason
I got this job,

772
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:46,891
and God bless that boy.

773
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:48,391
But I am screwed.

774
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:52,662
You know what?

775
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:54,530
I--

776
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:03,493
There is not a person
in the world

777
00:32:03,556 --> 00:32:07,352
that could do this,
except for you.

778
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:11,151
This is what you do.

779
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:14,193
I've seen you do it
with my own eyes.

780
00:32:19,195 --> 00:32:20,550
I believe in you.

781
00:32:23,857 --> 00:32:25,120
I believe in you
with every cell

782
00:32:25,196 --> 00:32:26,523
in my being.

783
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:32,322
Tame the wild beast.
I--I like that.

784
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:33,852
Tame the wild beast.

785
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:37,162
You know, I can't,
in good conscience,

786
00:32:37,175 --> 00:32:38,291
not go through any more...

787
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:51,032
Uh, Grandma, you--

788
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:52,872
you need to go into your room
for a minute, okay?

789
00:32:52,877 --> 00:32:54,603
Hmm? Who is it?
Grandma, please--

790
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:56,601
Who is it, honey?

791
00:32:56,677 --> 00:32:58,773
Uh, who is it?

792
00:32:58,836 --> 00:32:59,803
Matt, it's Coach Taylor.
Who?

793
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:00,871
It's Coach Taylor.

794
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,071
Uh, hey, Coach.

795
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:03,401
Coach Taylor's here?
Oh.

796
00:33:03,478 --> 00:33:05,101
How you doin'?

797
00:33:05,706 --> 00:33:06,133
How's it going?

798
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:08,133
Good, good.

799
00:33:08,206 --> 00:33:09,102
Gonna open the door?

800
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:11,102
Oh, yeah, how 'bout--

801
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:12,630
How 'bout if we
just go outside?

802
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:14,833
I think I'd like
to come inside.

803
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:17,201
Okay.

804
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:20,302
Um--

805
00:33:24,868 --> 00:33:27,630
So, uh, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

806
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:30,602
Uh, w-what's goin' on?

807
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,630
Oh, not much.
I just thought I'd stop by.

808
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:34,263
I wanted to have
a chat with you.

809
00:33:34,336 --> 00:33:35,401
Oh, it's, um--

810
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:37,530
Okay, okay.

811
00:33:37,608 --> 00:33:39,932
Um, is everything
all right?

812
00:33:40,006 --> 00:33:41,533
I thought maybe we'd
go over--

813
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:42,703
Hi, how are you, Coach?

814
00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:44,861
Hello, how are you?
Very nice to be here.

815
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:46,303
Thank you.
Oh, nice to see you.

816
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:47,403
Sit down.

817
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:49,001
Honey, move those books.
Oh, sorry.

818
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:51,101
And I brought you some cake.
I hope you'll enjoy it.

819
00:33:51,168 --> 00:33:52,332
Oh, no.
Sit down, have some.

820
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:53,462
I appreciate that.
I--

821
00:33:53,538 --> 00:33:54,503
I tell you what.

822
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,740
I, uh, I--

823
00:33:56,357 --> 00:33:58,960
Oh, wasn't he wonderful
Friday night?

824
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:00,722
Ma'am, he was.

825
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:01,980
Thanks, Grandma.

826
00:34:03,027 --> 00:34:04,431
I'm so proud of him.

827
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,961
You should be proud
of him.

828
00:34:07,616 --> 00:34:09,183
Uh--
I'll tell you what.

829
00:34:09,185 --> 00:34:10,450
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to take Matt

830
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,111
off your hands
for about an hour.

831
00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:13,412
There's something I'd like
to discuss with him

832
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:15,702
as far as the
football game this week.

833
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:15,781
Oh.

834
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:18,763
Yes, you do have
a big game,

835
00:34:18,835 --> 00:34:20,062
and yes, you can take him.

836
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:21,062
Thank you, ma'am.

837
00:34:21,138 --> 00:34:22,401
I'll have him back soon.

838
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:23,371
But I want you
to come back.

839
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,733
I will come back.

840
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:25,930
I'll come back for some more cake.
All right. You'll better do that.

841
00:34:26,008 --> 00:34:27,032
Next time, I'm gonna have
the milk, too.

842
00:34:27,105 --> 00:34:28,530
I'll get you some milk.

843
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:29,631
All right.

844
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:30,631
And I've got
hot chocolate

845
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:32,232
and everything
you could want.

846
00:34:32,308 --> 00:34:34,002
All right, you get some rest,
Grandma, okay?

847
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:35,273
All right.
I'll wait for you.

848
00:34:35,337 --> 00:34:36,533
Okay.
Now, you listen.

849
00:34:36,606 --> 00:34:37,661
You listen to him.
I will.
I'll be home--

850
00:34:37,735 --> 00:34:39,133
Move your feet.
Move your feet more.

851
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:40,203
Right.

852
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:41,831
I love you, Grandma.

853
00:34:41,908 --> 00:34:43,003
Love you.

854
00:34:44,508 --> 00:34:45,471
Will do.

855
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:51,762
Coach Taylor.

856
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:07,302
I could never sleep
the night before a game.

857
00:35:07,377 --> 00:35:10,731
In my head,
I'd go over the plays

858
00:35:10,805 --> 00:35:11,763
over and over.

859
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:14,300
It'd drive me crazy.
I'd read.

860
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:16,333
Bought a book on meditation.
That didn't work.

861
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:20,832
Your dad in Iraq,
that must be hard.

862
00:35:20,906 --> 00:35:23,230
It's not so bad, sir.

863
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:24,861
I tell you what.

864
00:35:24,937 --> 00:35:26,270
My dad, he was anything
but in Iraq.

865
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,003
My dad--

866
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:29,900
my dad was on me
day in, day out.

867
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:33,900
Still thinks I shoulda made
the NFL.

868
00:35:36,707 --> 00:35:39,631
But as much as I complain
about him,

869
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:42,432
I don't know where I'd be
without him.

870
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:47,400
You know, you--

871
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,800
I don't know how
you do it.

872
00:35:51,227 --> 00:35:53,183
I mean, you got
your time commitments.

873
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,923
You got your pressures.

874
00:35:55,127 --> 00:35:57,481
You got your studies.

875
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,352
All that, and being the man
of the house, too.

876
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,020
Yes, sir.

877
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,212
I'll tell you somethin'.

878
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:12,912
I know you didn't want me
to step foot

879
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:14,583
in your house tonight.

880
00:36:14,657 --> 00:36:16,153
But I'll tell you
somethin' else,

881
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,312
and don't you ever
forget this:

882
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,280
You should feel proud.

883
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:23,851
You should feel real proud.

884
00:36:23,925 --> 00:36:25,723
Yes, sir.

885
00:36:30,845 --> 00:36:32,483
This is all yours
for the takin'.

886
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,541
Depends on how much
you want it.

887
00:36:37,616 --> 00:36:39,340
It's yours
for the takin'.

888
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:43,480
You know,
the other night,

889
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:44,681
you played
for a few minutes.

890
00:36:44,747 --> 00:36:46,311
Tomorrow, four quarters.

891
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:50,843
You can't be distracted
by anything.

892
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,240
You're gonna have a lot
of distractions.

893
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:53,842
You're gonna have our fans,
their fans.

894
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:55,081
You got the band.

895
00:36:55,145 --> 00:36:57,111
You got the cheerleaders,
with their pretty,

896
00:36:57,185 --> 00:37:00,010
young-shaped legs
bouncin' up and down.

897
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,940
You got a job to do.

898
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:05,780
Nothing else.

899
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:20,442
Your teammates
gonna need to hear you!

900
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:22,482
You call the plays!

901
00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:24,883
You gonna be able
to call the plays?

902
00:37:24,947 --> 00:37:26,741
Yes, sir.

903
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:29,381
22 rocket on hit.

904
00:37:32,115 --> 00:37:33,483
22.

905
00:37:33,546 --> 00:37:34,742
20--
22 rock--

906
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:36,213
I can't hear you.

907
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,542
22.

908
00:37:38,617 --> 00:37:41,443
I can't hear you.

909
00:37:41,515 --> 00:37:42,842
22!

910
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:45,252
22 rocket--
This should be--

911
00:37:45,255 --> 00:37:47,821
You're QB1
of the Dillon Panthers.

912
00:37:47,827 --> 00:37:49,220
Your teammates,
if they can hear you,

913
00:37:49,298 --> 00:37:50,950
they will believe in you.

914
00:37:51,027 --> 00:37:52,753
Now, you let it out
until it hurts!

915
00:37:52,828 --> 00:37:53,820
You understand me?

916
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,290
22!

917
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,492
22 rocket!

918
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:59,020
Hit, hit, hit!

919
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:03,323
44 crossfire
on red.

920
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:06,522
44!

921
00:38:06,595 --> 00:38:08,793
44 crossfire!

922
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:10,451
Red, red, red!

923
00:38:10,525 --> 00:38:11,590
What's your name?

924
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:13,953
Matt Saracen!

925
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,353
What you play?

926
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:16,552
QB1!

927
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:18,090
And how do you play it?

928
00:38:18,157 --> 00:38:19,093
Perfectly!

929
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:20,591
We'll see about that.

930
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:22,050
Who do you play for,
Saracen?

931
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,292
Dillon Panthers!

932
00:38:23,357 --> 00:38:25,852
How much do you
want this?

933
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:27,893
I want it, Coach.
How much
do you want this?

934
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:29,350
I want it!

935
00:38:29,428 --> 00:38:30,552
Then take it!

936
00:38:30,627 --> 00:38:32,121
Do it again!

937
00:38:32,196 --> 00:38:34,093
44 crossfire!

938
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:35,123
Hit, hit, hit, hit!

939
00:38:38,218 --> 00:38:38,923
Well, Eric, you know,

940
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:40,740
you and I've known each other
a long time.

941
00:38:40,758 --> 00:38:42,481
I've known you since,
well,

942
00:38:42,546 --> 00:38:44,532
I was just a salesman here,

943
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:45,713
and you were the junior high
coach over there.

944
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:48,830
And, uh, well,

945
00:38:48,907 --> 00:38:51,702
you probably liked me
a lot more then, didn't you?

946
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:53,402
I wouldn't say that.
I don't know.

947
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:54,601
Well, I like you, Eric.

948
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:56,893
I just want you
to always know that.

949
00:38:56,896 --> 00:38:58,100
I like you,
and I believe in you,

950
00:38:58,128 --> 00:38:59,750
and I'm glad
you're back here with us.

951
00:39:00,057 --> 00:39:00,493
Good.
I appreciate that.

952
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:03,953
So.
It's Friday night.

953
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:05,520
You feel it?
You ready for it?

954
00:39:05,597 --> 00:39:06,493
Game night?
Yep, mm-hmm.

955
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:07,621
Right?
You ready to go?

956
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:08,890
We're gonna give 'em our best,
you bet.

957
00:39:08,957 --> 00:39:11,350
Well, I don't want
to hear that.

958
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:12,453
Now, this is not
just some game.

959
00:39:12,528 --> 00:39:13,181
You realize that.

960
00:39:13,188 --> 00:39:14,958
After what's happened
with Jason.

961
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:16,212
I mean, this is
about tradition.

962
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:17,681
It's about this town.

963
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,080
It's about the spirit
and keepin' this town alive.

964
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,801
That's football.
That's all we got.

965
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:23,151
Now, if we lose
this game,

966
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:26,613
this town's just gonna be
in a turmoil.

967
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:27,953
And I don't need that.

968
00:39:28,018 --> 00:39:29,712
Nah, we don't--
we don't need that.
No.

969
00:39:29,788 --> 00:39:32,453
This team needs a W.

970
00:39:35,016 --> 00:39:36,010
This town needs a W.

971
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:39,763
Hey.

972
00:39:41,258 --> 00:39:42,092
Always friends.

973
00:39:42,285 --> 00:39:43,812
All right.
Good.

974
00:39:43,886 --> 00:39:45,612
Go get 'em tonight,
Coach.

975
00:39:46,758 --> 00:39:47,752
Always friends.

976
00:39:48,897 --> 00:39:49,953
Always and ever.

977
00:39:50,028 --> 00:39:50,990
Always.

978
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:57,690
Oh, Lord,
it really brings me down

979
00:39:57,758 --> 00:40:00,690
About the devil town

980
00:40:02,928 --> 00:40:07,092
All my friends
were vampires

981
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:12,451
Didn't know
they were vampires

982
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:16,252
Turns out
I was a vampire myself

983
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:19,391
In the devil town

984
00:40:39,626 --> 00:40:45,120
I was livin'
in the devil town

985
00:40:45,198 --> 00:40:49,491
Didn't know
it was a devil town

986
00:40:49,556 --> 00:40:53,492
Oh, Lord,
and it brings me down

987
00:40:53,555 --> 00:40:56,393
About the devil town

988
00:41:16,995 --> 00:41:22,791
And all my friends
were vampires

989
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:26,793
Didn't know
they were vampires

990
00:41:26,856 --> 00:41:32,352
Turns out
I was a vampire myself

991
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:34,493
All right, listen up.

992
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:35,683
We've suffered a big loss.

993
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:37,747
A big loss.

994
00:41:37,747 --> 00:41:39,911
Some of you may be scared.

995
00:41:39,986 --> 00:41:41,413
And that's natural.

996
00:41:41,487 --> 00:41:44,583
Now, some of you
may be really pissed off.

997
00:41:44,647 --> 00:41:45,681
One good thing
about football is

998
00:41:45,745 --> 00:41:47,942
we get to channel
that energy.

999
00:41:48,018 --> 00:41:50,540
This team has never been
about one player.

1000
00:41:50,617 --> 00:41:53,081
It's about all of us.
Every single one of us.

1001
00:41:53,145 --> 00:41:55,580
And if we're gonna come back
from this loss,

1002
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,282
we're gonna need
every one of us.

1003
00:41:58,347 --> 00:42:00,581
Not one man.
Every single one of us.

1004
00:42:00,648 --> 00:42:01,583
Together.

1005
00:42:01,646 --> 00:42:03,582
All right, let's pray.

1006
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:05,242
Dear Lord,
please let us have

1007
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:06,511
a successful night tonight.

1008
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,012
A safe game.

1009
00:42:09,585 --> 00:42:11,282
Please let us all play
to our fullest potential.

1010
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:14,541
Please look over
Jason Street.

1011
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:16,246
Let him know that he's
in all of our hearts.

1012
00:42:16,246 --> 00:42:17,287
We love him.

1013
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:19,118
And we miss him.

1014
00:42:19,118 --> 00:42:21,962
Thine is the kingdom,
the power, the glory,

1015
00:42:21,968 --> 00:42:22,880
forever and ever.

1016
00:42:23,316 --> 00:42:23,820
Amen.

1017
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,751
Amen!

1018
00:42:24,757 --> 00:42:25,991
Clear eyes, full hearts...

1019
00:42:25,995 --> 00:42:27,113
...can't lose!

1020
00:42:27,117 --> 00:42:28,203
Let's get 'em!

1021
00:42:32,388 --> 00:42:33,112
Let's get 'em
out there, now!

1022
00:42:35,818 --> 00:42:36,490
Y'all take care.

1023
00:42:37,738 --> 00:42:39,410
Coach, good luck.

1024
00:42:45,455 --> 00:42:50,241
I was living
in a devil town

1025
00:42:50,245 --> 00:42:51,481
Didn't know it was...

1026
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:53,843
You up for this?

1027
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,373
Yes, sir.

1028
00:42:56,445 --> 00:43:00,000
Let me ask you
one question.

1029
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,673
Last Friday night,
when you threw that pass,

1030
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:05,271
that--that winning pass...

1031
00:43:05,347 --> 00:43:06,643
did you close your eyes?

1032
00:43:06,707 --> 00:43:09,571
No, sir.

1033
00:43:09,647 --> 00:43:10,802
My eyes were open, sir.

1034
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:13,940
My eyes were wide open.

1035
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:14,903
That's what I thought.

1036
00:43:14,977 --> 00:43:16,501
Let's go play football.
Come on.

1037
00:43:16,977 --> 00:43:21,501
