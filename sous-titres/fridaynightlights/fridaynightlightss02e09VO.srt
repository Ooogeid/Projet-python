1
00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:03,080
Like how I decorated?

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,541
Good thing you're a cool dude,
or I'd have to kill you.

3
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:09,420
- You let the damn team down.
- I'll do whatever it takes to stay.

4
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:13,007
- Santiago has been working for me.
- This is a boy who needs a home.

5
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:15,676
- He should move in with me.
- First real bed I ever had.

6
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:17,625
I like you. A lot.

7
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:23,350
You have not grown up yet.
And you are not rid me yet, you hear?

8
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:24,701
Go to hell!

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,520
I got this secret.

10
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:29,356
And it's startin'
to literally eat away at me.

11
00:00:29,618 --> 00:00:30,691
Just tell the truth.

12
00:00:30,953 --> 00:00:34,695
I need to speak to someone about the
murder of Mike Caldwell. I killed him.

13
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:43,413
And I went inside to get the food,
and she stayed outside.

14
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:46,853
As soon as I heard what was happening,
I dropped the bag and I ran out

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,894
and I just started hitting him.

16
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:51,241
You stepped in to help your friend,
is that it?

17
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:52,629
I wanted to kill him.

18
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:55,151
Yeah, but he was actually
hurting the girl, right?

19
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:00,584
I picked up a pipe
from the ground and I ran over.

20
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:03,186
I hit him twice in the head
as hard as I could.

21
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:07,097
Now listen. I'm gonna go get
a tape recorder, all right?

22
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:08,566
And I'm gonna be right back.

23
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:10,454
Stay put.

24
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,570
Chad.

25
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:20,749
The boy is not helping himself
out in there.

26
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:32,503
- Dad, what exactly are you doing?
- We're goin' home

27
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:34,755
We really weren't done talking in there.

28
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:37,984
We just need to go
and figure some things out, son.

29
00:01:38,354 --> 00:01:40,805
There's not anything to figure out.
I'm here to confess,

30
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:44,218
that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
We didn't finish what we're doing.

31
00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:46,968
- If we please go back in here.
- Son, listen to me.

32
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:49,061
Detective Tamber's trying to help you
out here.

33
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:52,523
I don't need to be helped out.
I need you to come back in here

34
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:55,192
so I can finish telling you
what... what it is...

35
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:59,154
I'm not gonna go anywhere.
I'm not... I came here to confess

36
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:02,518
- and that's exactly...
- You're goin' home. You're goin' home.

37
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:03,868
Now! Let's go!

38
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:05,744
- I'm not done telling you...
- Let's go!

39
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:13,432
I love you, bud. Let's go home.

40
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,939

44
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:10,359
Matthew.

45
00:03:12,448 --> 00:03:13,979
Did you eat my Snackwells?

46
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:17,849
My Snackwells!

47
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:21,263
Grandma, it's probably late
for you to be eating snacks.

48
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,656
Well, I want you to ask Carlotta
if she ate the Snackwells.

49
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:31,246
- You want me to ask her now?
- Well, no. In the morning!

50
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,750
Gettin' kinda tired of this.

51
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:39,486
You stole my grandma's Snackwells.

52
00:03:39,646 --> 00:03:41,882
You probably ate 'em too.
First you take the tapioca...

53
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:45,341
- Did I wake you up?
- Hi, Gracie.

54
00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:47,095
Sweetheart, will you please

55
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:48,887
make sure that you call today?

56
00:03:49,177 --> 00:03:53,515
Call the party rental place today
and make sure that they are not late.

57
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,524
- Before coming, you've got to shave.
- It's the 3rd time you've asked.

58
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:00,484
Mom, are these organic apples?

59
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:03,417
I doubt it seriously,
they were on sale.

60
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,863
I asked for organic apples.

61
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,486
Are you going to go shopping
for the christening dress?

62
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:08,992
And you've got the flowers?

63
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:12,788
- You're gonna clean up your room,
- Do you trust me to clean up my room?

64
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,901
I'm not gonna honor that
with a response.

65
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:16,735
You just need to chill out.

66
00:04:16,895 --> 00:04:18,956
This christening thing
is not that big of a deal.

67
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:21,409
It is a big deal because first,
you're the godmother.

68
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:23,731
Second, we've got family
comin' in from out of town.

69
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:26,766
It's your sister, and it's our family,
and it's a big deal.

70
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:29,539
I'm not only the coach around here,

71
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:32,266
but I'm also the director
of the athletic program.

72
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:34,685
And I've been brainstorming

73
00:04:34,947 --> 00:04:37,604
'cause the other departments
are woefully understaffed.

74
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:40,274
And I have been looking for someone who

75
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:43,603
owes me a favor. Someone who

76
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:46,154
has been disrespectful

77
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,616
and has shown
a great deal of selfishness.

78
00:04:50,252 --> 00:04:52,834
Can you think of anyone
off the top of your head?

79
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:56,623
Top of my head, first guy
that comes to mind is probably Williams.

80
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,751
You know what? I got a lot on my plate
right now, Riggins.

81
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:06,070
But I thank you very much
for volonteering.

82
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:09,297
And where we can start is with
the girls' varsity soccer ball uniforms.

83
00:05:09,457 --> 00:05:12,139
- And they are mighty dirty.
- So I'm just doing laundry now?

84
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:14,831
It ain't gonna do itself.

85
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:17,311
You know what? Don't even try

86
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:20,480
and show me that screech porn again
'cause little piece of me dies...

87
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:24,693
Hey, listen, man. I got somethin' else
for ya. It's a dating web site.

88
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:27,029
- No way.
- Hey, prudy, come on, man.

89
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,134
It's wheellovers.com, man.
It's bona fide. I'm tellin' you right-

90
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:32,492
I'm sure there are lookers.
They gotta be heifers.

91
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:35,579
Take a gander.
Take a gander.

92
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:36,956
Come on, man.

93
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:39,958
- Isabella. Stop on Isabella.
- Forget her. I'm looking for Charmaine.

94
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,877
Normal looking, which is a shocker.

95
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,629
Charmaine got a link to her

96
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:45,255
myspace page.

97
00:05:45,517 --> 00:05:47,636
- Wait, don't go there yet.
- Blow!

98
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:52,095
She got the camouflage panties. You
can't see 'em cause they're camouflaged.

99
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:54,775
- Is that your sister?
- Don't make it weird, man.

100
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,850
Now I ain't able to look at it.

101
00:05:58,197 --> 00:06:00,270
I just thought
I'd bring you boys a snack.

102
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:03,654
What was I just saying about
carrot sticks? I love carrot sticks.

103
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:06,326
- He loves carrot sticks.
- Thank you so much.

104
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:07,694
Hand 'em over.

105
00:06:07,956 --> 00:06:09,817
Just let me know
if you need anything else.

106
00:06:09,977 --> 00:06:10,989
Will do.

107
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:13,533
- Carrots and cookies.
- Beta-carotene: good for ya.

108
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:14,952
Party time.

109
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:17,306
You gotta get out of this place, man.

110
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:21,917
He runs 4', 4'40, benches 330 pounds.

111
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:25,587
When he comes to the quarterback,
it looks like he's standing still.

112
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:28,673
- It sounds like the second coming.
- Hallelujah.

113
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:30,926
How about it, kid? You walk on water?

114
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:33,482
You rain down fumbles from above?

115
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:37,766
And you may play a lot friday night too,
Santiago.

116
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:39,485
Be prepared.

117
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:52,644
Landry went down to the police station

118
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,242
and confessed the murder last night.

119
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,501
We're meeting with a lawyer,
and you'll need one too.

120
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:06,065
This guy's a...

121
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:08,839
good criminal defense attorney.

122
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:11,701
Just have your mom call me
when she gets home

123
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:14,959
- if you'll need help with the fees.
- What's gonna happen to Landry?

124
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:16,515
I don't know.

125
00:07:24,118 --> 00:07:26,044
Looking good! Riggins!

126
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,779
- Back on the football team, huh?
- Looks like it. Yeah.

127
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:37,545
So long as when you realize
return to the herd

128
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:39,368
is the biggest mistake of your life.

129
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,201
Don't tell me I didn't tell you so.

130
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:49,379
Okay.

131
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,125
I won't.

132
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,450
You idiot.

133
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,706
Your dad told me what you did. Why?

134
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:16,394
'Cause it was the right thing to do.

135
00:08:18,473 --> 00:08:20,322
I don't understand it, but I...

136
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,477
I just can't keep lying.

137
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:26,847
I wish I could but... I can't.

138
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:34,221
Come on, let's go, D!
Let's go, D!

139
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:40,303
Come on, Santiago.

140
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:41,765
Take that block on.

141
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:45,046
Did we not have this goin' last week?

142
00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:48,730
We were doin' fine last week.
What's different last week and now?

143
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:55,356
You contain 'em on the outside,
don't you? You key off the back

144
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:57,739
to see if he rushed the passer.
If he holds that ball:

145
00:08:58,001 --> 00:09:00,907
jailbreak. You go after the quarterback,
you understand that?

146
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:03,737
Do you understand that?

147
00:09:03,938 --> 00:09:06,621
- Can I have a verbal response, please?
- Yes, Coach.

148
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:09,605
Good. Thank you.
Now let's see you do it.

149
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:16,460
- What's wrong with my boy?
- You know, he's got great instincts

150
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,385
until you put him in first D.

151
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:20,612
He's having a bad day.
We all have a bad day.

152
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:23,385
An outside linebacker can get it done,
and I don't think he's it.

153
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:26,523
To tell you the truth, I think
it's his head, and that scares me.

154
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:35,777
Things can go in
vastly different directions on this.

155
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,049
What do you mean?

156
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:39,461
He could be trialed as an adult
for murder,

157
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,784
or he can be let out on probation.
It all depends on how we frame it.

158
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:45,120
What exactly does that mean,
to frame it?

159
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:50,625
Well, the legal definition is
defense of another.

160
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,811
If you reasonably believe
that it was necessary to hit that man

161
00:09:55,417 --> 00:10:00,195
with the pipe to protect your friend
from serious injury or death,

162
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,388
- then there's no crime.
- Well, I killed him, sir.

163
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:07,317
Necessary to protect

164
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:10,684
someone from serious injury

165
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:14,650
or death. Those are the magic words
that we need to focus on.

166
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,104
Why do I need magic words

167
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,946
to try and make me look good for this?

168
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:23,742
- Do you not understand what I'm saying?
- Landry, I understand very well.

169
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:25,882
I don't need to frame this
to make me look good

170
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,905
when the matter is that
I killed this man.

171
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:30,165
I understand that.
I've got the record right here.

172
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:34,336
But when I use the word frame,
don't think of it in a negative sense.

173
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:38,924
They can't catch him. He's too fast.
He scores!

174
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,394
Hey, stranger.

175
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:45,430
- What brings you by here?
- Just drivin' by.

176
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:48,058
It's my favorite Christian
in the neiborhood. One second.

177
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,596
Yeah, go ahead.

178
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,450
Hello.

179
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:54,802
Yeah, speaking.

180
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:58,485
Oh, hey, hi, Isabella. Yeah.

181
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:02,423
No, it's great to... It's great
to actually hear your voice, yeah.

182
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:05,116
No, this weekend is...
Yeah, that's fine.

183
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,006
Okay. That sounds good to me.

184
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:11,813
All right, talk to you later. Bye.

185
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:14,532
- Shut up.
- So who's Isabella?

186
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:17,213
She's just a friend of Herc's.

187
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:19,464
It's kinda like a setup thing.

188
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:23,885
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yeah, it is, actually.

189
00:11:24,147 --> 00:11:26,846
- Are you smitten?
- No. I'm not smitten.

190
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:28,781
We haven't even met yet.

191
00:11:28,977 --> 00:11:31,425
We're gonna go out this weekend
for the first time, you know.

192
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:32,894
I might've seen a picture.

193
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:35,188
That's very cool.

194
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:40,839
Hey.

195
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:43,819
Hey. What are you doing in here?
You said we weren't supposed to see

196
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:45,240
each other at school.

197
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:48,092
This is an exception.
I need to talk to you.

198
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:51,495
That sounds great. Sit down then.
What can I do for you?

199
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:54,573
Okay, so it's about mom
and the whole baby christening thing.

200
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:56,876
- She's going off the rails.
- What do you mean?

201
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:59,067
You've seen her yelling about cupcakes,

202
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:01,392
and party decorations
and foldig chairs...

203
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:02,971
It's very important to her.

204
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:05,476
And I realize it's an important day,
and for Grace.

205
00:12:05,636 --> 00:12:06,978
But I just... I don't know.

206
00:12:07,138 --> 00:12:09,264
I feel like I'm going to
disappoint her or something.

207
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:13,857
What do you mean "disappoint her"?

208
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:16,019
I feel like... I don't know.

209
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:19,493
I mean, I want to help. I really do.
But I just feel like she's asking me

210
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:23,003
to do a million things at once.
I have to keep up with my schoolwork.

211
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:24,779
And I'm practising for my SAT's,

212
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,445
and I have dance class,
and I write for the school paper.

213
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:30,410
All right, you know what I'll do?
I'll talk to her.

214
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:34,205
- Really?
- That surprise you?

215
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:39,732
Thanks. I appreciate it.

216
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,380
You're welcome.

217
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:16,271
- You doing all right?
- Not really. We just hit a 8.6, Coach.

218
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:18,541
Stacey should be hitting
those double backs.

219
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:20,502
She's been her own worst enemy all day.

220
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,087
It's pretty bad.

221
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:23,754
<i>Go, Dillon!</i>

222
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:27,467
Go, Panthers!

223
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:29,686
Let's go, Panthers, let's go!

224
00:13:30,672 --> 00:13:31,886
Who is this guy?

225
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,057
That's my roommate.

226
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:38,478
Get him over to the bleachers.
Step over to the bleachers.

227
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,986
It's a nice gig, man.

228
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:44,776
- No. It's not a nice gig.
- You seen this blonde in that outfit?

229
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:46,611
You know? You gotta let me, man.

230
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,916
All right, let's get out of here then.
Go down to the landin' strip.

231
00:13:51,076 --> 00:13:52,921
Early bird special.
Check out Mindy's new...

232
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:56,433
I can't go to the landing strip.
I gotta stay here till it's done.

233
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:58,205
Cool. I can stay, man.

234
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,563
I love me some acrobats.

235
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,349
Look at these girls, man.
You kiddin' me?

236
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,879
Let's go, Dillon!

237
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:08,641
So...

238
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,010
It's third and short.

239
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:13,161
It's an obvious run situation.

240
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:16,116
What defense you gonna be in?
Dime or prevent?

241
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,807
- Dime?
- No. Neither.

242
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:21,312
Trick question. I got you.

243
00:14:23,187 --> 00:14:25,483
Hey, how much of this book
do I need to know by tomorrow?

244
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:26,985
All of it.

245
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:29,489
Comin' up,

246
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:32,468
somethin' I invented here.

247
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,434
Steak and ramencini.

248
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:45,234
Julie came into the office today
to talk to me.

249
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:46,546
She did?

250
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:48,322
What about?

251
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:53,220
I think she's trying to help you out,
but she thinks

252
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:57,215
that you don't understand that,
because she's got so much going on.

253
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:01,140
She feels overextended
for all the things you're giving her.

254
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,521
She's got her homework.
She's got school. She's got...

255
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:06,776
- What things? What?
- Just the things that she... I mean...

256
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:08,915
You're giving her a lot to do, I think.

257
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,206
And she doesn't know how to deal
with everything. And she feels that...

258
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:13,531
Wait a minute.

259
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:16,791
She went into your office to talk to you

260
00:15:16,951 --> 00:15:19,162
about how I'm giving her too much to do?

261
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,334
I mean, you realize that I don't think
that's what that's really about?

262
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:27,899
'Cause I'll tell you right now.
If our laughter Julie who goes to school

263
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,206
and comes home, is overextended,

264
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:32,358
that's not the girl
we want to be raising,

265
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:35,720
if she can't help out when we've got
a big family weekend coming up.

266
00:15:38,515 --> 00:15:40,709
I hope you were clear with her
about that.

267
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:43,735
I told her just about
everything you said.

268
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,855
I'm sure you did.

269
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:54,572
Son,

270
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,346
can you turn off the music?

271
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,433
I just wanna talk.

272
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:05,262
Look, I realize that you're mad.

273
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:09,926
- I realize that that you don't think
- I'm not mad at you.

274
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:12,966
- I can handle the consequences.
- No, I can't handle it.

275
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:19,298
If you go to prison,

276
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,161
it'll break my heart.

277
00:16:22,196 --> 00:16:25,253
- It'll completely destroy your mother.
- I'm not gonna lie about this, dad.

278
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:27,063
Why is it a lie?

279
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:32,148
You didn't even know the man was there
until you heard Tyra screaming.

280
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:34,445
And when you came out,
he was attacking her.

281
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,214
What about the fact
that he was walking away?

282
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:39,909
Where does that come in to play?

283
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,829
Didn't you try to save him?
That's what you told me.

284
00:16:43,788 --> 00:16:47,094
Son, this man raped
five other young women.

285
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:49,715
You and Tyra were fearful
for your own lives.

286
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:54,591
This was self-defense.

287
00:17:07,813 --> 00:17:09,107
Mornin', Coach

288
00:17:11,411 --> 00:17:14,652
Thought I'd get a head start on laundry
and whatever else you need me to do.

289
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:18,947
This sudden work ethic of yours

290
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:21,993
doesn't have anything to do
with your living situation, does it?

291
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:28,944
Okay.

292
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,888
How you doin'?

293
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:44,307
Smash, you gotta stop
giving away the store, man.

294
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:46,100
They don't count the ice cream.

295
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:50,077
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Have a good one.

296
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,776
Hey, how you doin'?

297
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:58,196
- Oh, Smash, I got this.
- No, no. I got this.

298
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,239
My name's Brian Williams,

299
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:03,116
- but my good friends call me Smash.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

300
00:18:03,276 --> 00:18:04,911
But actually, I wanted to talk to Matt.

301
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:11,952
You think you can make me
a rocket launcher with jimmies, please?

302
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:17,799
He's gonna make some ice cream.

303
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:19,505
What are you doin' here?

304
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,899
- Grandma was in a burger mood.
- No, you're a liar.

305
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:25,854
- No, she did.
- No, she didn't. You wanted to see me.

306
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:27,809
Oh, thank you, sir.

307
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,471
- I can't eat this.
- Yeah, you can. It's all for you.

308
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:35,527
- I'm gonna go work on grandma's burger.
- Okay.

309
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:37,860
My God.

310
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:41,003
That's the girl livin' at your house?
It's your graduation day, fool.

311
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,699
- Shut up.
- Smash taught you well.

312
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:45,929
- Smash didn't teach me nothin'.
- The only sad thing is:

313
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:49,049
you're right in the middle
of something too good to last.

314
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:52,341
- What are you talking about?
- 'Cause this a situation with no rules.

315
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:56,005
Women like boundaries, okay?
They always want to define things.

316
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:58,547
No, but she's different,
she ain't like that.

317
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:01,718
Listen. You want this thing to last?
You need to set some ground rules.

318
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:13,641
Tyra, I feel like I'm choosing
between jail or hell.

319
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,446
Will you please just tell me the truth?

320
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:26,470
Were you in fear for your life?

321
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:30,235
Were you honestly in fear
for your life, Tyra?

322
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:40,396
He would've raped me.
He could...

323
00:19:42,546 --> 00:19:43,928
He coulda killed me...

324
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:55,200
if you hadn't been there...

325
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,018
You saved me.

326
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:13,118
So you're ready for the game tonight?

327
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,575
You may see
some playin' time tonight, son.

328
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:21,346
- What the hell's the point of all this?
- What'd you say, Santiago?

329
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:24,314
- I can't do it.
- What?

330
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:28,809
What do you care if I play, huh?

331
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:32,159
You don't know me.

332
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,857
You're not my pops!
You don't know nothin' about me.

333
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:40,917
You're just some fat white guy
who wants to make himself feel good.

334
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:43,110
And I don't need
nothin' from you, all right?

335
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:46,239
I don't need your car dealership
and I sure as hell don't need football!

336
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:54,117
Shut that door.
Shut the door!

337
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:02,112
I'll tell you what,

338
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:07,684
you want to go back to that cafeteria
eatin' off of plastic

339
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,472
with 200 guys goin' nowhere,
you be my guest, son.

340
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:16,939
Now listen to me.

341
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:20,046
Tonight is your night.

342
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:26,095
You have an opportunity to go out there
and accept the challenge.

343
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,782
You have the opportunity
to become part of a team.

344
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:33,710
If you don't do it tonight,

345
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,584
then you're never gonna do it
in your entire life.

346
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:42,857
Now, I'm goin' to the field.
So you get out, be my guest.

347
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,030
I hate you.

348
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:52,534
I hate you all.

349
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,833
I'm so glad that y'all
are gonna make it.

350
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:06,623
I know. Good, good, good.
We'll see you. Bye-bye.

351
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:09,092
Okay. So this is the godmother dress.

352
00:22:13,754 --> 00:22:15,912
Obviously this is
another thing I did wrong.

353
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:19,061
Well, sweetie, I'm just... I like it.
I think maybe, you know, if...

354
00:22:19,343 --> 00:22:23,306
So tell me what you want me to wear,
I will put it on. Tell me what to wear.

355
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:24,849
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

356
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,096
What you're doing.

357
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:28,484
- What am I doing?
- Let's get something straight.

358
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:32,238
It's been difficult
since Gracie came into this family.

359
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,986
But it's time for you
to rise up and to grow up.

360
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:40,542
It's not about Gracie.
This has nothing to do with Gracie.

361
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,040
I would love to grow up.
Why don't you let me?

362
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,355
I'm not doing anything to keep
you from growing up.

363
00:22:45,515 --> 00:22:47,360
OK, so according to you,

364
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:49,677
I can't dress myself,
I can't pick my own friends,

365
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:52,823
I can't make my own plans.
I can't even go to the mall

366
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:55,544
and pick out a dress with Shelly.
Everything I do is wrong.

367
00:22:55,704 --> 00:22:56,979
You know that's not true.

368
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:59,178
So somebody can take
a picture at this christening

369
00:22:59,342 --> 00:23:01,821
with your perfect little family
and your perfect little baby?

370
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,746
I'm not trying to make
everybody different.

371
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:06,180
I am trying to get you to grow up
into the person that I know

372
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,048
that I raised into this family,
and the beautiful girl that you are.

373
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,217
I'm acting a lot more grownup
than you are.

374
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:14,144
- Don't scream.
- I think you're the one who started.

375
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:16,358
You have been absent
ever since that baby was born.

376
00:23:16,518 --> 00:23:17,606
Don't tell me...

377
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:19,897
Don't you scream in front of the baby.

378
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:22,397
Don't you dare tell me
I'm not helping out.

379
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:26,169
Do you know how many things
I've done for you?

380
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:28,632
Do you know how many things
I've done for you?

381
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:31,652
A thank you would be nice.
That's all I'm asking for.

382
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:44,143
Well, I think a thank you
would be nice too.

383
00:23:54,772 --> 00:23:58,462
So why did you attack Mike Caldwell
on august 15, 2007?

384
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:02,668
I thought he was going
to kill my friend.

385
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:04,794
He was attacking her,

386
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:07,248
and it didn't look like
he was gonna stop.

387
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:15,850
I was in fear for my life.

388
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:22,882
So I tried to be a vegan when I was 14.

389
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:26,705
- How long did that last?
- Like six hours.

390
00:24:27,027 --> 00:24:29,680
- That's longer than I'd be able to do.
- It was awful.

391
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,121
I'm from Texas so...

392
00:24:32,446 --> 00:24:35,176
Would it be awkward if I was to ask you

393
00:24:35,336 --> 00:24:37,421
why exactly you posted on the web site?

394
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:41,402
Well, is it awkward
if I ask you why you were browsing it?

395
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,719
Yeah, kind of.

396
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:46,513
Kinda.

397
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:49,066
- You all done with these?
- Yeah. Thank you.

398
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:52,973
I see your point.
I'll refrain from asking that question.

399
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:54,377
It's no big deal.

400
00:24:54,537 --> 00:24:56,864
I guess I just want to find guys
who are more open-minded.

401
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,888
That is stupid.

402
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:01,940
Good answer. No. No.
Completely understand.

403
00:25:07,442 --> 00:25:08,793
Can I be honest with you?

404
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:14,445
- Of course.
- Can I tell you what gets me going?

405
00:25:16,578 --> 00:25:17,578
Sure.

406
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,388
Pee.

407
00:25:26,055 --> 00:25:27,659
Excuse me for a minute?

408
00:25:41,357 --> 00:25:43,192
Excuse me.
Could you do me a favor?

409
00:25:43,352 --> 00:25:45,305
Could you tell the lady that I had...

410
00:25:45,465 --> 00:25:47,454
There's an urgent family matter
I had to attend?

411
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:49,958
If the date's not going well,
just say something.

412
00:25:50,118 --> 00:25:52,710
- I'm not gonna help you ditch her.
- I'm not trying to ditch her.

413
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,213
You completely misunderstand.

414
00:25:54,475 --> 00:25:58,130
She's not your type, fine. Be honest
with her so you can both move forward.

415
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,828
I met this girl on a web site
and now she's talkin' about pee

416
00:26:00,988 --> 00:26:03,229
and I'm not exactly comfortable
with where it's goin'.

417
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:04,330
What?

418
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:18,970
- Care for dessert?
- I'll wait for my friend to get back.

419
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,870
Your friend left.

420
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:24,923
- Excuse me?
- Yeah. He left.

421
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:29,165
I'm sorry, you must be mistaken,
'cause he's in a wheelchair and I drove.

422
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:31,115
I'm sorry, he did.

423
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:35,477
So he just left the restaurant
and started wheelin' down the road?

424
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,840
- Honey, I don't have any idea.
- Whoa, don't honey me.

425
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:39,592
Don't ever...

426
00:26:39,854 --> 00:26:42,344
- Calm down. Ma'am, calm down.
- You want me to calm down?

427
00:26:53,534 --> 00:26:55,632
Hey Rig, you getting crunked over there?

428
00:26:58,223 --> 00:26:59,360
Let's go!

429
00:27:16,165 --> 00:27:19,215
<i>I tell you what,
this four hood quarterback, JD Pepper</i>

430
00:27:19,477 --> 00:27:22,131
<i>has lived up to his billing
as Mr Untouchable.</i>

431
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:25,054
<i>The Panther defense has yet
to get a saddle on Pepper</i>

432
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:28,224
<i>as he's s thrown strikes
from the pocket all night long,</i>

433
00:27:28,486 --> 00:27:31,963
<i>scoring touchdowns
on three of four possessions.</i>

434
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:36,670
<i>Pepper lets one go.</i>

435
00:27:37,495 --> 00:27:39,693
<i>And touchdown for Hood!</i>

436
00:27:39,955 --> 00:27:41,845
<i>As the cougars pull further ahead,</i>

437
00:27:42,005 --> 00:27:46,025
<i>28 to 13, that ends the second quarter.</i>

438
00:27:46,189 --> 00:27:49,589
<i>Coach Taylor has got to shake up
his defense for the second half,</i>

439
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:52,373
<i>and find somebody who's gonna
put pressure on their quarterback</i>

440
00:27:52,642 --> 00:27:55,751
<i>or that Pepper train's gonna
keep on rolling.</i>

441
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:57,461
Coach.

442
00:27:57,723 --> 00:27:59,373
Mac said you wanted to talk to me.

443
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:02,091
Here's what I got to tell ya.
I'd like for you to play Santiago.

444
00:28:02,353 --> 00:28:04,218
He's not ready to get in the game.

445
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,866
He is a street fighter. You never know
until you put him in the ring.

446
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:10,048
Give the kid a chance.

447
00:28:10,903 --> 00:28:11,903
I'm askin'.

448
00:28:13,463 --> 00:28:14,656
Is that it?

449
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:17,180
I'll take it into consideration.

450
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:22,319
<i>Anyone who's expecting a second
half adjustment from coach Taylor</i>

451
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:26,198
<i>is sorely disappointed.
as the JD Pepper hilight reel</i>

452
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,786
<i>continues at the expense
of this gizmo Dillon defense.</i>

453
00:28:37,236 --> 00:28:38,492
Santiago!

454
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:43,382
Come here. Come here.

455
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,457
Get your helmet on. You're goin' in.

456
00:28:47,702 --> 00:28:49,386
Get your ass in there. Let's go.

457
00:28:49,983 --> 00:28:51,257
Come on!

458
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:53,183
Come on, 59!

459
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:07,197
Let's go, girls.
Time to step it up, right now!

460
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:09,908
4-3, wide eyes,
outside diamond. Ready?

461
00:29:28,397 --> 00:29:29,654
- You ready?
- Ready!

462
00:29:41,076 --> 00:29:43,919
Don't come this way, bitch,
or I'll knock your ass out again.

463
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,259
You gotta hit him! You gotta hit him!

464
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:16,225
Wake up! It's time for you to wake up!
You hear me?

465
00:30:16,487 --> 00:30:17,976
Cover 4. Cover 4. Ready?

466
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:44,461
Get it! Get the ball!
Get the ball! Get the ball!

467
00:30:45,808 --> 00:30:47,561
All right. Here we go.

468
00:31:03,951 --> 00:31:06,733
All right. Here we go! Here we go!

469
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,028
You' going back in!

470
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:26,087
Good game, Smash. Good game, guys.

471
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,381
Santiago.

472
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,470
You won that game, son.

473
00:31:34,732 --> 00:31:36,439
- No. I just...
- Listen to me.

474
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:40,121
Listen to me. You changed
the momentum of the game.

475
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:42,478
You brought the magic.

476
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:46,894
And, uh...

477
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:52,070
About earlier in the car, that was cold.

478
00:31:52,332 --> 00:31:53,914
No, no. Thank you.

479
00:31:55,358 --> 00:31:56,366
For what?

480
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,914
Thank you.

481
00:32:05,804 --> 00:32:08,086
- So I opened the door.
- Right.

482
00:32:08,348 --> 00:32:10,329
And he is completely covered in leather.

483
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:12,095
I mean, head to toe.

484
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:16,352
Oh, yeah. He had the shoes.
He had the pants, the vest, the jacket,

485
00:32:16,546 --> 00:32:17,554
little biker hat.

486
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:20,857
- He's a winner.
- That's a winner.

487
00:32:21,343 --> 00:32:24,937
But I have to ask you:
Did he have to go number one?

488
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:28,364
Yoou are pretty competitive
in the whole bad date arena, aren't you?

489
00:32:28,524 --> 00:32:30,172
I'm always competitive about everything.

490
00:32:30,351 --> 00:32:32,528
And as far as this arena goes,
it's no contest, I win.

491
00:32:34,028 --> 00:32:35,918
Okay. Fine. Okay, you win.

492
00:32:36,078 --> 00:32:38,594
I'll give it to you this time.
All right.

493
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:42,454
You really saved my ass tonight.

494
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,748
No problem.

495
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:05,727
Do you think we should...

496
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,378
talk about maybe some

497
00:33:10,885 --> 00:33:12,025
ground rules?

498
00:33:13,944 --> 00:33:16,043
- What?
- You know, just...

499
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:19,283
Kinda just put the fish on the table
so that we both

500
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:21,419
so that we both know what's goin' on,

501
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:23,679
how we each feel,
that way no one'll get hurt.

502
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:25,163
Smash kinda had

503
00:33:25,425 --> 00:33:28,414
this point about how if we don't both...

504
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:40,137
I think I wanna teach you
how to make mole.

505
00:33:41,942 --> 00:33:43,312
- Okay.
- Okay.

506
00:33:44,624 --> 00:33:45,895
Good night, Matt.

507
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:02,661
- Tim.
- Oh, God!

508
00:34:02,963 --> 00:34:04,494
You forgot to feed the ferrets.

509
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:06,616
Put it down.

510
00:34:07,118 --> 00:34:08,790
You forgot to feed the ferrets.

511
00:34:09,052 --> 00:34:11,888
What'd I say you had to do to stay here?
I told you to feed the ferrets.

512
00:34:14,634 --> 00:34:15,634
I'm sorry.

513
00:34:20,532 --> 00:34:22,763
- Put it down.
- Got you.

514
00:34:23,346 --> 00:34:26,145
You should've seen your face, man.
Come on, man.

515
00:34:26,305 --> 00:34:29,658
Some of my friends stopped by.
We're having a little impromptu soiree.

516
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,232
Why don't you meet my buddies?

517
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:33,624
Come on, man,
'cause you didn't feed the ferrets?

518
00:34:34,964 --> 00:34:36,907
Hey, but feed the ferrets, dude.

519
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,982
Hey, buddy,
did you feed the ferrets today?

520
00:34:42,383 --> 00:34:44,284
Tim, man, these are my buddies.

521
00:34:44,546 --> 00:34:46,574
Shotgun, Connor,

522
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,184
Spence and Pete is
around here somewhere.

523
00:34:49,344 --> 00:34:51,791
- How you doin' today?
- That's Pete right there.

524
00:34:52,721 --> 00:34:53,721
This is Lisa.

525
00:34:54,222 --> 00:34:55,233
Here you go.

526
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:59,466
I'm alright. You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go get some vodka.

527
00:34:59,954 --> 00:35:02,639
- Oh, that's good idea.
- You guys need anything?

528
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,262
You need some money, man?

529
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,813
No, I'm good.

530
00:35:07,937 --> 00:35:10,936
What'd I tell ya?
My roommate's a giver, not a taker.

531
00:35:52,181 --> 00:35:54,228
- Hey, dad.
- You all right?

532
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:57,519
- Yes, sir.
- Jason Mitchell Street.

533
00:35:57,953 --> 00:36:00,504
Your father has been up all night
trying to call you.

534
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:03,065
- We had no idea where you were.
- Yeah, she's right.

535
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:06,031
- This is not fair to your mother.
- You guys are right.

536
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:07,924
To neither of us. You understand that?

537
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,245
It's unfair for you to stay up
and wonder where I am.

538
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,901
I'm sorry. It can't happen again
and it won't happen again, okay?

539
00:36:17,686 --> 00:36:19,225
I'm movin' in with Herc.

540
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:25,093
- You just gonna wear this?
- Yeah.

541
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:28,076
Hey, girls.

542
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:30,390
Can I talk to Jules for a second?

543
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,434
I'm just gonna put her necklace on.

544
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:36,366
- You know, I can do it. I'll do it.
- I think I can get it.

545
00:36:36,526 --> 00:36:38,315
That's all right. Honey, I can do it.

546
00:36:38,669 --> 00:36:40,988
- She looks beautiful.
- I know.

547
00:36:53,455 --> 00:36:56,216
I was thinkin' about
you were right about something.

548
00:36:58,273 --> 00:36:59,407
About what?

549
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:02,515
I do want a great family picture today.

550
00:37:10,342 --> 00:37:13,420
I think that's why this whole
christening has been so important to me,

551
00:37:13,628 --> 00:37:14,955
is because,

552
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,900
you know,

553
00:37:20,357 --> 00:37:21,721
I want our family back.

554
00:37:25,213 --> 00:37:26,363
I want you back.

555
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:31,153
And now we have Gracie,

556
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,444
and Gracie's part of it.

557
00:37:34,178 --> 00:37:36,288
And today's about
bringing her into that.

558
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:38,979
But you being the godmother,

559
00:37:40,616 --> 00:37:43,290
it's 'cause, you know,
when she was born, I thought to myself

560
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:46,924
this is the luckiest girl in the world,
cause she has Julie as her older sister.

561
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:51,429
You are the most special person
in the world

562
00:37:52,058 --> 00:37:55,007
and so, today, for me,

563
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:56,891
why it's been such a big deal...

564
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:02,579
is 'cause today

565
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:07,066
I'm gonna be able to celebrate

566
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:09,943
my two amazing daughters.

567
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,469
I love you, honey.

568
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,454
I'm sorry for earlier.

569
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:31,708
It's okay.

570
00:38:36,176 --> 00:38:38,746
- Who has the baby, y'all?
- I have the baby.

571
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:42,684
- Okay, good.
- Did you take the quiches off?

572
00:38:42,844 --> 00:38:44,650
Oh, gosh. Oh, good.
Julie did it. Thank you.

573
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:45,808
I got it.

574
00:38:45,968 --> 00:38:48,001
They need to be brown on top.

575
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,281
- They're kinda like green
- Hey, hon.

576
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:53,783
Honey, come here. Come here.

577
00:38:54,643 --> 00:38:56,447
- Honey.
- What?

578
00:38:56,933 --> 00:39:00,374
Well, I think Tim Riggins
is parked out in front of our house.

579
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:02,423
It looks like he's asleep.

580
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,557
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know what it's all about.

581
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:08,582
Do you think I should put these out now,
or should I wait until we're back?

582
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:55,553
Will you take this, son?

583
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:57,055
You got that?

584
00:39:57,317 --> 00:39:59,599
I've been looking for,
maybe, do something with it.

585
00:40:04,923 --> 00:40:06,279
Right there.

586
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:11,710
Smash those peanuts. That's good.

587
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:19,869
Not for eating. It's for puttinng it in.

588
00:40:24,177 --> 00:40:26,307
Christening is our acknowledgment

589
00:40:26,514 --> 00:40:31,006
that this little one is included
in God's unconditional love.

590
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:34,684
Today, Gracie Belle reminds us of

591
00:40:34,844 --> 00:40:37,060
God's unconditional love for all of us.

592
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,140
Love, and forgiveness,

593
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:42,767
and new life given by our Lord.

594
00:40:57,939 --> 00:41:01,367
We welcome the newest member
of our church family,

595
00:41:01,568 --> 00:41:03,788
the newest member of God's family.

596
00:41:04,274 --> 00:41:06,343
Gracie Belle Taylor.

597
00:41:55,752 --> 00:41:57,592
They're not pressing charges.

598
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:13,717
Thank God.
