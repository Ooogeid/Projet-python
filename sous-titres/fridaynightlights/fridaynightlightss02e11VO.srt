1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:03,247
I really do wonder why it is
that you just refuse to grow up.

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:06,250
I can tell you why. Because then
I might end up just like you.

3
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:08,994
My phone is ringing off the hook
day and night.

4
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:11,589
My kid is acting
like he needs a Hollywood agent.

5
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:14,174
These recruiters wanna try
to get you to commit

6
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:16,176
to any other school any way they can.

7
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:20,180
The high school in Laribee...

8
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:23,767
Half of school got completely lifted up
and knocked out by the tornado.

9
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,687
We're gonna be good hosts and guests.
I know coach Dickes

10
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:30,441
and as long as he don't stir things up,
I think it's gonna be just fine.

11
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:32,901
- Hey, what are you doing?
- He pissed on my shirt.

12
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:35,821
Don't you push me!
Don't you ever lay your hands on me!

13
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,243
You ever, I mean,
ever touch one of my players again...

14
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:42,610
Hey, Jules.

15
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,705
- It's time we go.
- Where's my beer?

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,291
Remember what I said about being quiet.

17
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,627
- Okay, you good?
- I'm good.

18
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:51,754
- Hey, Jule.
- Coach...

19
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:54,340
It's not even close to what you think.

20
00:00:54,602 --> 00:00:57,500
Go get your stuff
and get out of this house right now.

21
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:05,100
<i>... used to be
we had to wait till February</i>

22
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,479
<i>in the national letter
of intent signing day,</i>

23
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:10,235
<i>but folks, the times, they have changed.</i>

24
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:13,004
<i>It is all about verbal commitment now.</i>

25
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:15,806
- <i>And the race is on to see which one...</i>
- Hey, Smash.

26
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,822
<i>Where you at? Alabama's
and Oklahoma Tech on their way.</i>

27
00:01:19,084 --> 00:01:21,611
Yeah, I'm just coming up.
Oh my God, Alabama!

28
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:22,944
- <i>Hurry up.</i>
- Okay.

29
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:25,282
I'm coming up right now, bye.

30
00:01:25,757 --> 00:01:29,194
I have been to the mountain top
and Tuscaloosa is here.

31
00:01:29,354 --> 00:01:31,044
God bless America

32
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:33,280
and God bless Alabama football.

33
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:35,255
Here she is.

34
00:01:37,102 --> 00:01:38,217
I'm sorry, I'm late.

35
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,676
That's all right.

36
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:42,638
This is my girl. Her brother plays
for the Miami Southern,

37
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,683
- so, she's like my advisor.
- Nice to meet you too.

38
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:48,843
- Hi, Mrs Williams.
- I was just telling Brian here,

39
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:51,815
that we got a slot all ready to go
for him there in Tuscaloosa.

40
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:54,108
National Championships,
it's pretty good resume.

41
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:55,944
Young lady knows her stuff.

42
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:58,654
Now, all we need is verbal commitment,

43
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:00,782
and red carpet'll roll
like the tide itself.

44
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:04,950
Great. But are you willing to weigh the
physicals and garantee all four years?

45
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,039
That's something we'll definitely
have to consider. She knows her stuff.

46
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:10,708
Yeah, she knows a thing or two.

47
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,295
Oklahoma Tech, where legends are made.

48
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:16,798
- All real, all real.
- Yeah?

49
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:19,938
Alright, now. Do you ever play
football in a snow storm, son?

50
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,177
It's epic.

51
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:23,579
Michigan is
the harder college football, Brian.

52
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:25,875
And we'd like
to make you part of our team.

53
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:28,225
You're gonna be our next big star.

54
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:31,770
You gotta come play in Georgia, Brian.
They'll love you there.

55
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:33,356
Y'all are definitely top 5.

56
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:36,317
Look, all I need is a verbal...

57
00:02:36,577 --> 00:02:39,135
We'll let you know, okay?
But, thanks for the peanuts.

58
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:40,946
They boil these things.

59
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,575
So good, they'll make you
wanna slap your grandma.

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,910
- Thanks for coming out.
- Alright.

61
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:48,913
- Take care. You'll call?
- Yes, sir.

62
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:11,170
How you doin'?

63
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,903
Good.

64
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:14,585
About last night,

65
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:16,775
I put you in that situation.

66
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:19,287
- No, wait...
- No, just listen to me.

67
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:22,890
I should not have trusted
Tim Riggins being in this house,

68
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,616
I should have talked to y'all before,

69
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:27,304
I made any decision on having him here.

70
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:32,624
He so much even looks at you at school,
I want you to tell me about it,

71
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:34,283
you understand that?

72
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:35,494
Please?

73
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:40,839
You gotta pick it up,
or we're gonna be late, okay?

74
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:44,568
Yeah.

75
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:52,605

79
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:57,082
You cannot be in here after hours.
You understand me?

80
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:00,517
I want you to clear this stuff up
and clear out.

81
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:01,681
You got it?

82
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:12,077
Noannie!
Are you messing with my phone again?!

83
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:13,056
No.

84
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:15,010
It was in my room, so somebody took it.

85
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,565
- I didn't. Bug off!
- Don't just up walk on outta here!

86
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:19,534
Noannie, I'm not playing.
Where's my phone?!

87
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,399
What are you doing to your sister?

88
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,515
Is that what your little girlfriend
tells you college boys do nodays?

89
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:25,903
Look, don't start, mama.

90
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:28,489
"Don't start, mama"?
Who you think you talkin'to?!

91
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:31,658
- Somebody took my phone.
- She didn't take it. I did.

92
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,660
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

93
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:35,413
You've been on it day and night.

94
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:39,082
So now get your head back in school
and leave this recruitin' mess alone.

95
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:41,461
I've to make a verbal commitment.
You understand?

96
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:43,359
Yeah, I understand that.

97
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,628
I also understand
you need to use your head.

98
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:47,546
If you commit too soon,

99
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:50,053
and you don't think
about everything that's involved,

100
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:52,638
you're gonna be makin' a big mistake.

101
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:54,650
I'm gonna do this, mama.

102
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:56,650
With you...

103
00:05:57,354 --> 00:05:58,518
or without you.

104
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:00,715
Now I gotta get to class.

105
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:10,823
Hey, Shel.

106
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,868
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

107
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:14,285
It smells good.

108
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:18,206
- Is that my shirt?
- No.

109
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:20,314
- It looks like it.
- OK, it's your shirt.

110
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:21,918
But you should give it to me.

111
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:24,170
- It's too sexy for you.
- I beg your pardon?

112
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,447
It's too tight.
You can't wear this to school.

113
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:29,342
What about the boys' hormones?
They'll think you're hitting on 'em.

114
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:31,344
Oh, that is ridiculous.

115
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:33,769
- It's not too tight...
- Here's your bowl.

116
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:35,974
- or sexy, or anything like that.
- Tami?

117
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,101
- What?
- My results.

118
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:40,895
- You got it?
- What is it?

119
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:42,479
Open it. Open it.

120
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:45,357
- What is it?
- It's the results from her exam.

121
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:47,818
Oh, my God, I passed!

122
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,406
You did!

123
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,962
- That's great, sweetie.
- I know.

124
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,410
I'm so proud of you!

125
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,204
She passed!

126
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:00,905
Shelly Hayes passed the test.

127
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:03,437
That's excellent.
What are you gonna do now?

128
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:06,296
- What are you gonna do now?
- I don't know, I mean...

129
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:07,922
I take y'all to dinner.

130
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:09,506
Oh, that's so sweet.

131
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:12,573
- Let's have some dinner at Applebees.
- Wait, now.

132
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,388
You just passed the test,
you gotta figure out a few things:

133
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:18,933
how you'll jump start the business,
where you'll go, how you'll set it up.

134
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:21,643
And I can talk to a bunch of people,
get you involved

135
00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:24,559
with a lot of folks that can give you
answers to your questions.

136
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:26,607
Oh, my God, Eric.
That would be so amazing.

137
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:29,265
No, anything I can do
to help you with that.

138
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:31,654
That's the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me.

139
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:33,216
It's my pleasure.

140
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,616
I was gonna talk to you about this,

141
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:38,247
but when you're starting out
as a real estate agent,

142
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:41,176
you have to do these cold calls
as the fondation of your business.

143
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,818
I don't want to make all those calls
and tie up your phones,

144
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:47,272
so I did a little bit research.
And it would only cost $9 a month

145
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:49,775
to put a new phone line in here.
And I was thinking

146
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:52,832
since you have a teenager
we could share a phone line.

147
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:55,281
- That sounds good to me.
- That sounds like something

148
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,722
we should definitely talk about.
Absolutely.

149
00:07:57,982 --> 00:08:01,920
For sure, but let's go to Applebees.
That sounds like a great idea.

150
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,829
This stuff'll keep till tomorrow.
All right?

151
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:06,814
Let me get my stuff. Hold on.

152
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:31,524
You here?

153
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:46,437
Look, it was just
a friendly gesture, that's all.

154
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:49,166
I understand,
but I can buy my own groceries.

155
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:52,216
Miss Williams,
I know being a single parent's hard.

156
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:55,123
You've done a great job with your kids,
supporting them as a nurse.

157
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:57,718
I just want you to know
Oklahoma Tech is here for you.

158
00:08:57,878 --> 00:09:00,660
In many cases, we can provide
a first-class relocation.

159
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,830
Mister, you need to think about
relocatin' your butt up out of my way.

160
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,052
Housing near the campus
for the athletes' parents

161
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,709
- so the families can stay together.
- Stay together?

162
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,300
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,197
And we'll arrange for job for you too,

164
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:14,632
with good pay at the local hospital.
And you get

165
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:17,314
all your weekends off,
so you can catch all Brian's games.

166
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,637
You might be
the nicest person I ever met,

167
00:09:19,897 --> 00:09:21,764
or you might be Satan himself.

168
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,377
But either way,
this conversation is over.

169
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:26,174
Miss Williams, just hear me out.

170
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:28,227
No, what happens if he gets hurt, huh?

171
00:09:28,387 --> 00:09:30,148
What happens to my house and my job,

172
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:31,613
my son's education?

173
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:34,277
- He's not gonna get hurt.
- You tell me that.

174
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:37,697
- Hey.
- Everything all right?

175
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:39,643
Everything's just fine.

176
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:42,326
Seems like you need to step away.

177
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:44,717
- Ladies, please.
- That's the right thing to do.

178
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:47,290
- You need to step away.
- You heard what she said.

179
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,501
Have yourself a good day, okay?

180
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,420
How was your day?

181
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,925
It was good. How was yours?

182
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:01,721
Let's go.

183
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:08,310
Learned anything interesting?

184
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:13,742
Not really.

185
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:20,503
It's that girl.

186
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:25,286
She got my son's head spinnin'
every which way direction.

187
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:27,987
- I don't like it.
- That girl Noelle?

188
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:31,080
- I raised these kids by myself.
- I know.

189
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,003
My whole life has been about
taking care of them.

190
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,757
And she waltzes in
and is trying to turn him

191
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:41,511
into some rich fast-talking
blinged-out football star,

192
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,429
or some kind of hot prospect.

193
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,932
He ain't gonna do nothin'
but get chewed up and spit out.

194
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,475
I just want him to be a good man,
you know?

195
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:50,561
I know.
But what he's trying to do is

196
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:53,135
he's trying to take responsibility
for his future,

197
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:55,333
in whatever way he knows how.

198
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:02,841
I just didn't think
it would be this hard letting him go.

199
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,494
I know, that's for sure.

200
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:08,686
I know that.

201
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,610
I... I just...

202
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,593
I came over to apologize
about the other night. My dad just...

203
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,804
He jumped to conclusions,

204
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,224
and... and I just...
I couldn't tell him.

205
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:30,572
That's fine.

206
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,520
I'm really sorry, though.

207
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,984
Don't worry about it.

208
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:37,194
And I wanted to say thanks
for saving me from that whole...

209
00:11:37,684 --> 00:11:39,019
Riley thing.

210
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:41,324
It wouldn't have ended good.

211
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:42,878
I agree.

212
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,761
Yeah, I don't...
I don't think so.

213
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,268
But really, it's...
It's fine.

214
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:50,037
It'll blow over, I'm sure.

215
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:52,415
Thanks.

216
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:54,124
You're welcome.

217
00:11:54,954 --> 00:11:57,877
Okay, well, I will see you later then.

218
00:11:58,286 --> 00:11:59,385
Good night.

219
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:10,474
<i>Coach Taylor and the Panthers</i>

220
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:13,059
<i>have been hard at work all week, folks.</i>

221
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,938
<i>The big game this Friday has become
even more of a rivalry</i>

222
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:19,792
<i>due to the fact the Lions
have set up camp here in Dillon.</i>

223
00:12:20,393 --> 00:12:22,970
<i>Close quarter have led to
more than a few altercations,</i>

224
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,448
<i>including a reported dust-up</i>

225
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:29,075
<i>between Coach Taylor
and Laribee's Coach Dickes.</i>

226
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:42,523
Coach.

227
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,509
- You want to get a beer with me?
- I don't drink, Coach Taylor.

228
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,970
You don't drink,
or you don't drink with me?

229
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:52,293
Look, I know y'all been uprooted.

230
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:54,485
I know it's not easy,
space beg around here...

231
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:56,728
it's very small.
I know times are tough.

232
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,849
Thanks for acknowledging
that times are tough.

233
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:01,131
Thanks for helping me out with that.
By the way,

234
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,443
I went ahead and spoke
with Coach Roberts.

235
00:13:03,704 --> 00:13:06,052
And it seems tomorrow
we'll be moving my team

236
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:08,157
into the girls soccer team locker room.

237
00:13:09,194 --> 00:13:10,451
I'm really busy, Coach.

238
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:12,903
Just go ahead
and take that country charm of yours

239
00:13:13,063 --> 00:13:14,622
and go buy somebody else a beer.

240
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:27,424
He have you talked to TMU yet?

241
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:30,681
They playin' hard to get,
but you know, so am I.

242
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:32,640
So we'll see how it works out.

243
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,298
Yo, what's up, Swash?

244
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:36,960
Hey, what's up, chippendale?

245
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,893
Yo, man, TMU came a callin'.

246
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:40,898
I'm playing football
in Austin this fall.

247
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:45,276
Hey, man, listen,
we gonna be teammates or what?

248
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:49,599
Hey, look, listen up.
I got better thing to do than TMU.

249
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,117
Like what, you get the manager job
at the Alamo Freeze?

250
00:13:57,831 --> 00:13:59,207
Alabama, baby!

251
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:00,888
Alabama!
What?!

252
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,062
S-E-C.

253
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:04,255
You gave Alabama the verbal?

254
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:05,526
You know what?

255
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:07,918
It's gonna be the shot
heard around the world.

256
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:10,207
- You just gonna have to wait and see.
- Oh, I will.

257
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,479
Good luck.

258
00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:19,251
I thought, like, 'bama's sweet,
but I thought...

259
00:14:19,411 --> 00:14:21,195
You sure you don't want to go to TMU?

260
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:23,649
You don't wanna hold out
and see what they got to offer?

261
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:29,225
- Ask me what I'm doing.
- What are you doing?

262
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:31,347
Getting some paper towels
to clean up a dozen eggs

263
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:33,742
that are on our kitchen floor.
Shelly went to the store

264
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:36,370
which I asked her to do:
to go get eggs, because we needed eggs.

265
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,205
And then she comes in and dropped 'em
all on the floor, like a dingbat.

266
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:40,787
And then she just looks at 'em,

267
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,709
she just stares at 'em
and says, "oh, no,"

268
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,656
and then walks back to the back bedroom.

269
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:47,547
Maybe it's time for her to fly the coop.
You ever think about that?

270
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:51,135
She keeps telling me that
I need to cut my hair all off.

271
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:53,715
Because of the baby and everything.
That it's too long.

272
00:14:53,981 --> 00:14:56,398
It's starting to get me insecure.
Do I need to get my hair cut?

273
00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:59,560
No, you don't need to. Your hair
is perfect, stop listening to her.

274
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,581
- She's driving me crazy.
- She should cause she's crazy.

275
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:05,559
Hey, hon, you know what
I've been meaning to tell you?

276
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:07,517
- What?
- I ran into Corrina Williams,

277
00:15:07,677 --> 00:15:08,732
at the market.

278
00:15:08,892 --> 00:15:11,739
And she was being accosted
by a recruiter.

279
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:14,058
And she just seemed at her wit's end.

280
00:15:14,385 --> 00:15:16,392
It seems like she's real worried
about Smash,

281
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:19,694
about this girlfriend of his,
she thinks is a bad influence.

282
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:22,686
There's nothing I can do
about all his girlfriends, so...

283
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:23,875
I'm just saying,

284
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:26,586
you know, it might be good
if you had a talk with him,

285
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:29,253
because he does not have
a male role model in his world.

286
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:30,802
I'm gonna do that too,

287
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:34,046
as soon as I figure out how not to get
my ass handed to me on Friday night.

288
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:35,713
Okay? Thank you.

289
00:15:36,948 --> 00:15:37,948
Oh, God.

290
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,054
Tami...

291
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:42,268
I was just blow drying my hair,

292
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,443
and all this black smoke
start to coming out.

293
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:47,651
I think it's probably broken.
Do you have another hair dryer?

294
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:50,546
No. Actually, Shelly,
that's the only hair dryer we have.

295
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:52,353
I think you better go get another one.

296
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:55,015
While you're at it, maybe pick up
some eggs. That'll be great.

297
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:59,657
No, I never said I sent the payment.

298
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:04,958
But I'm gonna send that money
right now, actually. Okay.

299
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:12,967
How you doing?

300
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:15,925
- All right.
- What's up?

301
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,954
Just moving our stuff out.

302
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:19,639
How you and Billy doing?

303
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:21,180
We broke up.

304
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:25,229
Sorry to hear that.

305
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,622
You know, uh, if you want
to finish that Riggins trifecta,

306
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:34,331
I think my dad lives in corpus still.
I could probably give you his address.

307
00:16:34,772 --> 00:16:36,537
That's just mean.
You're awful.

308
00:16:36,777 --> 00:16:39,134
I think you kind of deserve it,
don't you think?

309
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:40,849
Yeah...

310
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:42,287
I do.

311
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:46,027
You want to tell me what happened
between you and Billy or what?

312
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:48,173
Look,
I know you're gonna hate me forever,

313
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,716
and I don't blame you
but I want you to know...

314
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:53,799
that I was alone and I was scared,

315
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:56,594
and I was just trying
to build a life for my son.

316
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:58,929
- So what happened?
- It didn't work out.

317
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,215
He lost his job.

318
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:03,495
And I can't handle two mortgages.

319
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,453
I mean, I could been
the first to tell you

320
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:08,112
that guy can't hold a job
for more than six months.

321
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:09,382
You know...

322
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:14,506
I hope you can patch things up with him,

323
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,478
'cause he loves you so much.

324
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:18,782
Maybe...

325
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:21,336
Maybe you need him too, you know.

326
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:26,063
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get in the way.

327
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:34,263
Have a safe trip, wherever you're going.

328
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:37,960
Bye.

329
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,476
Is that The Office? Oh, my God,
I love this show. I'm so addicted to it.

330
00:17:57,636 --> 00:18:00,198
I was so scared that it didn't tape.
Have you ever seen it?

331
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:01,740
It's so good.

332
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:05,370
Actually, I don't know if you would
really like it. It's very talky.

333
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:07,395
You taped over my game.

334
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:10,876
I'm sorry.
It was an important game?

335
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,152
Yes, it was a very important game!
You taped over my game.

336
00:18:14,312 --> 00:18:15,343
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:17,255
I mean, I didn't know.
I just...

338
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,677
I just used the tape that was in there.

339
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:22,720
You know, you guys...
You should get a TiVo.

340
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:24,390
Can I ask you something?

341
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,475
You got any concept
about personal property?

342
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:31,223
You know, like how about
personal private moments

343
00:18:31,383 --> 00:18:34,400
in the privacy of one's
personal, private space?

344
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:36,528
Do you understand what I'm saying?

345
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,742
- I know what privacy means.
- I understand

346
00:18:38,902 --> 00:18:40,976
that you're my wife's sister
but we've been wondering

347
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:43,658
when is it, exactly, that you're
gonna get a place of your own?

348
00:18:47,923 --> 00:18:49,653
I didn't mean it to come out like that.

349
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:51,521
- Oh, my God.
- That came out wrong.

350
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,836
That came out wrong.
I'm sorry.

351
00:18:54,096 --> 00:18:55,129
Just stop talking.

352
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,885
- I didn't mean to say it like that.
- No, I heard you,

353
00:18:58,045 --> 00:18:59,886
it's fine. I'll take the laundry.

354
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:01,885
I just feel kind of stupid right now.

355
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:03,845
It's fine.

356
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:15,482
Come on in.

357
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:18,039
Oh, she's with me, Coach.

358
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:19,903
Noelle.

359
00:19:20,163 --> 00:19:22,197
Yes, hi.
It's so nice to meet you.

360
00:19:22,457 --> 00:19:24,950
I'm a very big fan.
The way you took down West Cambria

361
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,245
at the state championships last year
was the best coached game

362
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:31,582
- I think I've ever seen.
- I'm glad you noticed. Thank you.

363
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:33,292
You're welcome.

364
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,547
So imagine your phone is
ringing off the hook.

365
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,871
You're getting text messages
till 4:00 a.m.

366
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:39,186
What's it all mean?

367
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,010
Well, playing at Alabama
is at the top of the list.

368
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:44,436
Alabama?

369
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,129
Anything else?

370
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:48,298
Lots of places, Coach.
We're thinking

371
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,559
a national championship run
would be beneficial.

372
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:52,834
It's lots of coverage, good exposure.

373
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:54,622
So I roll on over to Alabama.

374
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:58,025
Coach has got good ties to the pros,
and I'm living the NFL dream.

375
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:00,277
TMU?

376
00:20:00,986 --> 00:20:02,571
I still haven't heard from 'em.

377
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:04,843
They're getting back
at you for walkin' on 'em.

378
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,413
Any history between me and TMU
has nothing to do with you.

379
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,477
They want you,
they're gonna come after you.

380
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:12,247
Look, the point is
I gotta make a verbal, Coach.

381
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:15,125
Before you hear from TMU,
you gotta make your verbal?

382
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:16,502
I mean...

383
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:18,962
What am I supposed to do?

384
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:22,049
All right, let me tell you what I know
about Alabama, then.

385
00:20:22,602 --> 00:20:25,839
They got the best running back
in the conference: Demetrius Walsh.

386
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:28,132
And another thing:
he is not going pro either...

387
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:30,807
- He's staying his senior year, we know.
- That's one year.

388
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:34,144
I can handle it if it means Alabama.

389
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:38,065
What about Waters? 500 yards this year.
He's a freshman backup.

390
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:42,069
He's already mastered their offense,
which is extremely complicated.

391
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:45,056
Now, that's your sophomore, junior year
on the scout team.

392
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:47,081
That's three years on the bench

393
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:49,868
before you even touch your foot
on that turf on a Saturday.

394
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:54,665
Or there are other situations out there:
schools that need you to play now.

395
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,617
It's gonna be a fight.

396
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:58,836
You gotta give yourself
the opportunity to play,

397
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:00,504
the opportunity to be seen.

398
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:03,105
You might want to
settle down, take a breath.

399
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:06,385
And you definitely want
to look at the fine print, son.

400
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:09,778
I'm saying: be patient.
Don't let 'em pressure you.

401
00:21:11,341 --> 00:21:13,934
And don't end up making any
emotional decisions.

402
00:21:15,036 --> 00:21:16,520
That makes a lot of sense.

403
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,127
What does your mother say?

404
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:21,441
My mom?

405
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:24,298
The woman who gave you birth,
what did she say?

406
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:25,772
Honestly,

407
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,248
I don't think my mom knows
the difference between Alabama

408
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:30,951
and Dillon Junior College.

409
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:33,799
Let me tell you something.
My last piece of advice for you.

410
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,664
Listen to your mother.

411
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:39,613
You listen to her, and you respect her.
You understand what I'm saying?

412
00:21:41,158 --> 00:21:42,546
Now get the hell out of here.

413
00:21:42,806 --> 00:21:45,340
- Let me finish my lunch.
- Appreciate it.

414
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:48,663
- Let me know you need anything else.
- All right.

415
00:22:01,491 --> 00:22:04,336
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking into a motel.

416
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:06,778
- Why? What happened?
- Eric asked me to leave.

417
00:22:08,484 --> 00:22:11,116
Well, hon, he's in a terrible...
He's such a grump this week.

418
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:14,620
No, he didn't mean it.
Come on, let's go back in the house...

419
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,456
- Sweetie, come on now.
- Honey, it's for the best, OK?

420
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:21,084
I don't want to be an imposition.
I just wanted to help with Gracie...

421
00:22:21,344 --> 00:22:24,929
Well, hon, listen.
Now come on, we need to talk about this.

422
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:26,757
Come on, Tami, you want this.

423
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:28,717
Yes, you do, honey.

424
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:32,179
OK, I mean, you didn't want to tell me,
that's fine. You got Eric to do it.

425
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:34,522
But you know...
It's fine.

426
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,392
I'll call you when I check in.

427
00:22:43,115 --> 00:22:44,242
I understand.

428
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:51,740
Coach.

429
00:22:56,984 --> 00:22:59,119
You left your playbook on the field.

430
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:04,415
You're just
a regular boy scout, aren't ya?

431
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,008
You're welcome.

432
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:34,574
What are you doing?

433
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:37,119
I lost my keys.

434
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:39,454
You look like crap.

435
00:23:58,196 --> 00:23:59,364
How you doin'?

436
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:02,896
I left Julie down at the sandwich shop.

437
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:05,147
Did you kick my sister
out of the house today?

438
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:06,523
No, I didn't.

439
00:24:06,783 --> 00:24:07,908
What happened?

440
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:10,151
I asked your sister
when she was gonna leave.

441
00:24:10,698 --> 00:24:14,388
And your sister got very upset
and she pretty much inferred the rest.

442
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:16,533
And that's pretty much what happened.

443
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:20,417
I wish maybe you'd talked to me
before you'd had that conversation.

444
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:22,078
OK.

445
00:24:23,935 --> 00:24:26,107
And in the future, if there's
a family member of mine

446
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:27,986
that's gonna be kicked out
of this house,

447
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:30,087
I would prefer that I do
the kicking out.

448
00:24:31,753 --> 00:24:32,756
OK.

449
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:35,892
OK.

450
00:24:40,818 --> 00:24:44,424
It's like everything happened at once.
I got laid off. I got no severance.

451
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:47,590
They didn't give me any kind of notice
that this was gonna happen.

452
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,180
So now I'm broke,

453
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:53,480
And Jackie's going crazy
'cause she's got a kid,

454
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,095
and I got no money to pay for the house.

455
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:59,756
And, you know, that's when
she bailed on me.

456
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:05,763
I don't know what else
there is to say about that.

457
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,332
Look...

458
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,333
Tim?

459
00:25:17,588 --> 00:25:18,588
I'm sorry.

460
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:22,516
I know I screwed up.
All right?

461
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:25,760
I never should have gotten
with that girl.

462
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:28,395
And I'm sorry if I hurt you.

463
00:25:28,936 --> 00:25:31,064
It was selfish and...

464
00:25:33,107 --> 00:25:34,160
I'm sorry.

465
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:43,286
Looks like it's just us two, hu?

466
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:50,794
What are we gonna do
about the house, Billy?

467
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,381
We gotta come up
with $2,000 in two weeks.

468
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,313
I don't know, unless you got
some great idea,

469
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,584
I think we're gonna have
to start packing our bags, man.

470
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:09,902
Ready?

471
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:12,229
Before I go, I want you to know

472
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:14,956
that I'm sorry
I went off the handle with your sister.

473
00:26:15,245 --> 00:26:16,653
And I apologize.

474
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:22,725
It's just, you know, there is nothing
in the world I hate

475
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:26,538
worse than hurting her.
No matter how much she's irritating...

476
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,231
I know that, and I'm gonna call her
and I'm going to apologize to her.

477
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:33,528
And we will work it all out.

478
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,924
- She was here for a long time.
- You damn right she was.

479
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:41,427
It'll be nice to have our house back.

480
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:42,887
Damn right it will be.

481
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:48,738
What I dread now is what in the world
we're gonna do with Gracie Belle

482
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:50,520
while we're at work.

483
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:51,982
I just... I hate it.

484
00:26:52,142 --> 00:26:53,744
Can I tell you something?

485
00:26:55,037 --> 00:26:56,649
That's not our burden.

486
00:26:56,809 --> 00:26:58,252
And it's our gift.

487
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:01,740
Go win a football game, please.

488
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:03,909
All right.

489
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:05,178
OK.

490
00:27:07,132 --> 00:27:09,162
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- I gotta go.

491
00:27:09,322 --> 00:27:11,357
I really need to talk to you right now.

492
00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:14,387
It's about the other night,
and the whole Tim thing.

493
00:27:15,357 --> 00:27:16,845
It wasn't his fault.

494
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:19,092
What do you mean?

495
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:20,800
It was my fault.

496
00:27:22,337 --> 00:27:25,639
We were at this party,
and I was drinking,

497
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:28,615
and there was this other guy
named Riley.

498
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,556
And I was about to get in trouble,

499
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:35,005
and Tim stopped it, and he took me home.

500
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:37,651
And he was trying to sneak me in, and...

501
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:39,882
Then you came in and...

502
00:27:41,474 --> 00:27:44,080
And I'm just trying to say
it was my fault.

503
00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:50,956
Damn, Julie.

504
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,542
I'm sorry.

505
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:55,654
Damn.

506
00:28:07,774 --> 00:28:10,100
- Attaboy!
- You gotta pick that up!

507
00:28:14,852 --> 00:28:18,815
<i>This contest has turned out
to be a good old-fashioned shoot-out,</i>

508
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:22,153
<i>a day gun duel in D-Ville:</i>

509
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:24,614
<i>Taylor vs Dickes.</i>

510
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:58,677
We got a corner
that's missing every time!

511
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,775
The corners gotta step up!

512
00:29:04,474 --> 00:29:05,688
<i>It's late in the fourth.</i>

513
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,784
<i>Panthers are down by five
with 1:34 left in the game.</i>

514
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:13,287
<i>It's third down, Panthers need a first.</i>

515
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,540
Take 70. He's been there all night!

516
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Time!

517
00:29:35,997 --> 00:29:38,477
What's that, eight?
Fourth and eight?

518
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:41,691
The safeties
should watch for play-action,

519
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:43,443
he's gonna try to bust the seam.

520
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,571
- You wanna go cover-three?
- No! Have bandit come up and cover.

521
00:29:46,831 --> 00:29:49,866
I've been baiting this hook
all night long. He's gonna take it.

522
00:29:50,126 --> 00:29:53,739
If we go x-seam on the safeties,
we get Matt to hit it quick. It'll work.

523
00:29:54,297 --> 00:29:56,443
Unless he wants us to go to the seam.

524
00:29:56,877 --> 00:29:58,541
You guys are stinkin' up the field!

525
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:01,961
- One play, girls. You got in in ya?
- Yes, sir!

526
00:30:02,686 --> 00:30:04,005
Listen up, listen up!

527
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:07,258
Let's go 26 fake keeper.

528
00:30:07,518 --> 00:30:09,177
Matt, you take it on the boot.

529
00:30:09,437 --> 00:30:12,179
This is what they're gonna do.
They're gonna fake on tackle 26.

530
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,701
Let's make sure
you get to the outside, son.

531
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:16,379
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

532
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:18,616
They're gonna bring Saracen
around the edge.

533
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,438
He'll go wide. Nail him there!

534
00:30:20,698 --> 00:30:23,191
- Let's show 'em what we got.
- You gotta be aggressive.

535
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,819
Let's get this done!
Let's get this done.

536
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,321
- Let's take this home right now!
- Get out there!

537
00:30:29,582 --> 00:30:32,242
- One, two, three... Panthers!
- Let's go, baby. Let's go!

538
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:38,206
<i>Here we go, the game comes down
to this play.</i>

539
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:42,627
<i>The Lions will win
if they can stop the Panthers here.</i>

540
00:30:42,887 --> 00:30:45,797
Been reading your mail, Coach Taylor.
It's time to take you to school.

541
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,523
Let's go!

542
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:51,327
<i>Hang on to your hats, folks.
This is it.</i>

543
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:53,840
<i>Fourth down.
Saracen is over the ball.</i>

544
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,932
<i>It's a handoff to Smash.</i>

545
00:30:56,192 --> 00:30:59,131
<i>No, Saracen keeps the ball on bootleg.</i>

546
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:00,734
<i>He's got nowhere to go.</i>

547
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:03,773
<i>He's looking to pass.
He dishes it to the flat. Tim Riggins!</i>

548
00:31:04,057 --> 00:31:05,024
Gotcha!

549
00:31:05,284 --> 00:31:07,360
<i>And he's got some blood, baby!</i>

550
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,810
- Get him! Pick him up!
- There you go!

551
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,531
<i>To the 40, the 45!</i>

552
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,074
Take it in, baby!

553
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:15,012
<i>He's in Lions' territory</i>

554
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:16,184
Go and get him!

555
00:31:16,344 --> 00:31:20,331
<i>Tim Riggins could go all the way.
Holly cow!</i>

556
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:23,877
What the hell was that?

557
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:25,713
You see that?

558
00:31:26,045 --> 00:31:28,548
All you gotta do is take him down!
Get off of me!

559
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,385
Get off of me!
That's all it takes to take somedy down!

560
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,970
You stick 'em!

561
00:31:35,003 --> 00:31:36,723
You say good-bye to playoff!

562
00:31:40,877 --> 00:31:43,313
Coach interferce.
The game's over.

563
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,061
- All right, that's it. Take it in.
- Let's go!

564
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:48,280
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go.

565
00:31:55,402 --> 00:31:57,202
Can I have a word in here alone, please?

566
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,002
Thank you much.

567
00:32:04,945 --> 00:32:06,491
What the hell was that?

568
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:08,425
Don, what the hell was that?

569
00:32:08,585 --> 00:32:11,799
You know what I think?
I think you owe this school an apology

570
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:14,010
is what I think.
And not only that,

571
00:32:14,271 --> 00:32:17,888
but you owe the players over there
an apology. That's what I think.

572
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:21,809
- I got it.
- You got what? What's it you got, Don?

573
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:23,590
I've done everything I can.

574
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,731
This school has reached out,
it has opened its arms to you.

575
00:32:27,218 --> 00:32:30,776
- You don't know what I'm going through.
- No, I don't know. But you know what?

576
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:32,292
For two weeks now,

577
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:35,198
we've done everything that we can
to help you out over here.

578
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:36,994
I've been putting up with two weeks.

579
00:32:37,154 --> 00:32:40,077
- Why don't you share with me?
- My wife's got three months to live.

580
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:45,457
And I don't have a game plan for that.

581
00:32:51,522 --> 00:32:52,981
I'm not using that...

582
00:32:53,345 --> 00:32:55,331
as an excuse, please know that.

583
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,522
I do owe you an apology.

584
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:04,430
You tell Riggins he's a fine player.

585
00:33:05,243 --> 00:33:06,962
And I'm deeply sorry...

586
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:09,503
for what I've done to him.

587
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:13,271
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

588
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:17,311
I'm not gonna be coaching anytime soon.

589
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:27,757
I'm very sorry.

590
00:33:28,736 --> 00:33:29,736
Thanks.

591
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,460
Guy.

592
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:49,964
Guy, it's Riggs.

593
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:52,366
Buckle up.

594
00:33:57,457 --> 00:33:59,949
Just get your crap
and let's get out of here.

595
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:06,761
I'll just be down here
becoming a meth addict.

596
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,471
All right, we're good.

597
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:11,866
Let's go.
Come on.

598
00:34:12,138 --> 00:34:13,671
I gotta put that back, Billy.

599
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:16,352
I'm not just gonna leave his gun
down there, he'll know.

600
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,427
Hurry up, put it back,
and let's get the hell out of here.

601
00:34:21,942 --> 00:34:23,501
What are you doing?
Come on!

602
00:34:25,725 --> 00:34:26,726
Really?

603
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:28,810
- Cash.
- Put it back.

604
00:34:29,072 --> 00:34:30,980
Come on, just put it back
and let's get out...

605
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:32,964
It's a lot of money.

606
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:34,567
It's our mortgage.

607
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:44,083
Hurry up.
Come on.

608
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:46,244
Put the gun back
and let's get out of here.

609
00:34:46,506 --> 00:34:47,997
Let's go.
Come on.

610
00:34:48,257 --> 00:34:50,939
Billy, this is like,
a good chunk of change...

611
00:34:55,064 --> 00:34:56,631
Look, she just woke up.

612
00:34:58,769 --> 00:34:59,769
Hey.

613
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,056
Could I get a decaf, please?

614
00:35:05,554 --> 00:35:06,555
Thanks.

615
00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:08,642
- How are ya?
- I'm good.

616
00:35:08,904 --> 00:35:10,729
So I brought the real estate section.

617
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:12,405
And actually, there are a couple

618
00:35:12,565 --> 00:35:15,273
of really cute-looking places,
like, right in the neighborhood.

619
00:35:15,535 --> 00:35:19,111
Okay, Tami, I've been doin'
my own homework,

620
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:21,361
and I have found some really good leads.

621
00:35:21,521 --> 00:35:22,651
Oh, really?

622
00:35:23,115 --> 00:35:24,117
In Dallas.

623
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,599
You're going to Dallas?

624
00:35:29,992 --> 00:35:30,992
How come?

625
00:35:33,395 --> 00:35:35,471
Because I'm driving you crazy,
that's how come.

626
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:36,921
- No, you're not.
- Yes.

627
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,464
Come on, Tami.

628
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:41,839
You know, Hon, it's just
the house is a little bit small.

629
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:42,801
Thank you.

630
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:45,831
And I do think that it's probably good

631
00:35:46,107 --> 00:35:49,141
for Eric and me
to have some privacy again, and...

632
00:35:49,403 --> 00:35:50,403
Yeah.

633
00:35:51,536 --> 00:35:54,178
But that doesn't mean
I want you to go to Dallas.

634
00:35:54,614 --> 00:35:56,453
I have got to get my life together,

635
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:59,110
and I don't think
that's going to happen here in Dillon.

636
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:06,534
I kinda like the idea
of having you around.

637
00:36:10,198 --> 00:36:12,615
- We're gonna miss you.
- Thank you.

638
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,667
And I can't thank you enough.

639
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,775
Thank you for asking me.

640
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,414
Hey, what are we gonna do
with the extra grand?

641
00:36:27,574 --> 00:36:28,847
What are you talking about?

642
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:30,890
We got the mortgage covered,
plus a grand.

643
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,478
That's the last thing I'm worried about.
We just stole $3,000 from a drug dealer.

644
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,685
You don't think there's gonna be...

645
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:38,702
No, you gotta relax, you know why?

646
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:41,319
He's probably so high
he doesn't even know what hit him.

647
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:44,781
- Who the hell is that?
- That can't be him.

648
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,200
- Don't answer it...
- I'm not gonna, relax!

649
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:51,161
Oh, it's coach.
It's coach.

650
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:52,422
We're fine.

651
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:55,707
- Hey, Tim...
- Hey, coach.

652
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:57,876
- Coach, how you doin'?
- Hey, how you doin'?

653
00:36:58,138 --> 00:37:00,004
I'm good, I'm good.
Things are good.

654
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,450
All right.

655
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,882
I'll let you guys...
do your thing.

656
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,636
Come here.
Let me talk to you a second.

657
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:12,433
I jumped to conclusions.

658
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:15,520
I'm well aware of
what happened the other night.

659
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:18,271
I apogize.
I was wrong.

660
00:37:18,712 --> 00:37:20,988
- It's fine, coach.
- No, it's not fine.

661
00:37:21,438 --> 00:37:23,361
I couldn't have mishandled it any worse,

662
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:25,664
and I apologize.

663
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:28,763
The last couple weeks
have been giving you hell.

664
00:37:28,923 --> 00:37:32,328
And not once,
have you come to me and complained.

665
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:35,330
And then... Then you got it
where you protected my daughter,

666
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:37,565
and you're not letting me
think bad of her.

667
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:40,544
And again, you don't say a word.
Not a word.

668
00:37:41,107 --> 00:37:43,798
And I'll tell you something,
not as a coach, but as a father...

669
00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:46,342
You realize
what an honorable thing that is?

670
00:37:46,914 --> 00:37:48,468
That is very honorable.

671
00:37:49,662 --> 00:37:50,912
Thank you, sir.

672
00:37:52,622 --> 00:37:53,622
All right.

673
00:37:53,944 --> 00:37:55,066
Rest this weekend.

674
00:37:55,226 --> 00:37:56,769
- Will do, coach.
- Betcha, buddy.

675
00:37:57,467 --> 00:37:58,467
You betcha.

676
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,066
What's your game plan with that burger?

677
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:03,900
Cool out, just cool out.

678
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:10,302
Hey, Smash.

679
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:12,952
- Congratulations. Good game last night.
- Oh, thank you.

680
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:14,907
You got a minute?
Can we talk?

681
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:17,247
Yeah, sure, I got a minute.
Yes, sir.

682
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,672
You were really good last night.
You really played well.

683
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,801
And I'm here because we want you
to play football for us at TMU.

684
00:38:29,316 --> 00:38:30,972
We're offering you a full scholarship.

685
00:38:31,132 --> 00:38:34,723
And all we need to get this done is
for you to give me a verbal commitment.

686
00:38:38,991 --> 00:38:40,770
Yeah, but there's no reason
to rush, right?

687
00:38:41,115 --> 00:38:43,301
I mean, we need to talk
about the fine print.

688
00:38:43,461 --> 00:38:46,962
Well, the fine print is this:
it's gonna get down to trust.

689
00:38:47,122 --> 00:38:48,404
Who are you gonna trust?

690
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,574
No other program is gonna work harder
at getting you to the NFL.

691
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:55,458
That's why we recruit so well:
we get guys to the NFL.

692
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,014
All we need you to do, come play for us,

693
00:38:58,174 --> 00:38:59,915
work hard, earn your spot,

694
00:39:00,176 --> 00:39:02,208
and I promise you
you'll get a shot at the pros.

695
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:06,214
Trust me.
If you trust me, we can make it happen.

696
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,925
Well, thanks.
I'm real glad we had this talk.

697
00:39:10,526 --> 00:39:11,677
Thank you.
I'm too.

698
00:39:12,198 --> 00:39:14,523
- I'm gonna be waiting to hear from you.
- Okay.

699
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:20,143
Of course you know, it's always been
my dream to play for TMU.

700
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:22,714
Can I take that as a verbal commitment?

701
00:39:28,982 --> 00:39:31,322
Hey, y'all, the Smash is gonna
play for the "U," baby!

702
00:39:37,213 --> 00:39:39,164
- All right.
- I'll take care of you.

703
00:39:39,422 --> 00:39:40,920
I won't let you down.

704
00:39:44,385 --> 00:39:45,835
How you doin', baby?

705
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:49,297
I gotta go tell my mom, yeah.

706
00:39:49,457 --> 00:39:51,592
- I'll see y'all later.
- All right, go, Smash.

707
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:55,587
Turn that off.

708
00:39:57,392 --> 00:39:58,523
Slide over.

709
00:40:03,604 --> 00:40:06,065
I cannot tell you
how disappointed I am in you.

710
00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:09,599
You lied about Tim Riggins,
you lied to me, you lied to your mother,

711
00:40:09,759 --> 00:40:12,196
and that's something
we don't teach in this family.

712
00:40:12,772 --> 00:40:14,282
I don't know when it is

713
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:16,680
I'm gonna be able to trust you again.

714
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,826
I'm beyond angry, honey.

715
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:23,449
I think the best word to describe it
would be "hurt."

716
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:27,961
As far as you drinking...
You're too young.

717
00:40:28,937 --> 00:40:30,694
You, your mother and I
are gonna sit down

718
00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:34,737
and have a talk about that as soon
as she and I sort this whole thing out.

719
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:37,263
And I think she would also
want me to tell you

720
00:40:37,524 --> 00:40:38,606
that, yes...

721
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:41,285
people do make mistakes...

722
00:40:42,411 --> 00:40:44,292
and I understand that too.

723
00:40:45,229 --> 00:40:46,902
I love you so much...

724
00:40:48,135 --> 00:40:50,263
and that will never change.

725
00:40:54,947 --> 00:40:55,948
<i>Capiche</i>?

726
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:58,165
<i>Capiche</i>.

727
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:02,269
Hey, babe.

728
00:41:03,803 --> 00:41:06,101
- Everything's all right here?
- Everything's just fine.

729
00:41:06,261 --> 00:41:08,075
How is your sister doing?

730
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:09,660
She is doing all right.

731
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,047
She's gonna be great.

732
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:12,687
Movie night?

733
00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:14,508
- What are we gonna see?
- Great.

734
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:18,098
I rented this movie
from the library: <i>Cinema Paradiso</i>.

735
00:41:18,258 --> 00:41:20,346
It's mama's choice.
Let's watch <i>Foul Play</i> again.

736
00:41:20,885 --> 00:41:23,100
All right, it's mom's choice.
<i>Foul Play</i> tonight.

737
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,820
- I'll get the popcorn.
- Goldie Hawn, Chevy Chase.

738
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:27,493
Go see your daddy.

739
00:41:36,054 --> 00:41:39,044
But I'm making butter, real butter.
It's gotta be real butter.

740
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:43,303
Now, this is the most important thing
that a man can...

741
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:44,642
What are you doing?

742
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,374
Ooh, don't hit yourself.

743
00:41:52,528 --> 00:41:55,758
Take them damn shoes off. You know
I just scrubbed this floor yesterday.

744
00:41:58,742 --> 00:42:00,846
- What is this?
- I'm in, mom.

745
00:42:01,254 --> 00:42:03,224
I'm going to TMU.
They want me.

746
00:42:07,467 --> 00:42:10,481
- You sure that's what you want?
- Yes, ma'am.

747
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:16,542
Oh, baby!

748
00:42:18,781 --> 00:42:20,031
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
