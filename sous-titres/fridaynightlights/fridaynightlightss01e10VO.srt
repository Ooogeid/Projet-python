1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,200
She's on the phone right now

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,100
with Matt Saracen.

3
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,100
It's becoming that thing

4
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,700
that we always knew was gonna happen

5
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,500
with our little girl.

6
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,200
Mr. Hunt's been scouting high school ball

7
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,300
since before we were born.

8
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,700
You make his top 100 list,

9
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,800
you're good to go.

10
00:00:10,807 --> 00:00:12,200
You had a rough time out there tonight.

11
00:00:12,203 --> 00:00:14,807
To be honest, I'm worried
about your strength and size.

12
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:16,204
So what you should work on

13
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:18,306
is lifting and conditioning.

14
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:21,203
Try to get some power in those
legs and upper body.

15
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,102
Did you hear what Lyla did?

16
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,103
Yeah, I did.

17
00:00:26,107 --> 00:00:27,002
No, I haven't.

18
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:29,002
She slept with Riggins.

19
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:32,300
Anybody but her.

20
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:36,101
You go and steal a cripple's girl

21
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:37,302
but you won't fight a cripple?

22
00:00:37,307 --> 00:00:38,903
You're a coward, Riggins!

23
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:40,603
You know me and the guys
always got your back.

24
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:42,802
We're gonna take care of this, man.

25
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:13,502
Let's do this.

26
00:01:14,606 --> 00:01:16,800
Ready?
Five, six, seven, eight.

27
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:19,100
One, two, three, four, five.

28
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:21,400
Ride it, Brittany. Arms straight and tight.

29
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:22,003
Yeah.

30
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:25,100
Lyla, you're late.

31
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:26,403
I know. I'm sorry.

32
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:27,603
I don't want apologies.

33
00:01:27,607 --> 00:01:29,101
The Classic is five days away

34
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:30,001
and you're a captain.

35
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,200
This is not acceptable.

36
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:32,401
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

37
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,200
Is it wrong to enjoy this?

38
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:37,502
All right, let's do our liberties.

39
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:39,503
Girls on top are Jessica,

40
00:01:39,508 --> 00:01:41,002
Grace, and Lyla.

41
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:42,102
Ready?

42
00:01:42,507 --> 00:01:44,600
Five, six, seven, eight.

43
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:45,703
One, two--

44
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,101
No, it's a basic liberty, Lyla.

45
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,500
Summer camp stuff.

46
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,203
What's going on with you?

47
00:01:51,806 --> 00:01:54,000
I guess Tim Riggins banged
the balance right out of her.

48
00:01:54,008 --> 00:01:55,303
Let's do it again.

49
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:58,701
It's like he doesn't want us to be together.

50
00:01:58,705 --> 00:01:59,701
I don't know if that's--

51
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:01,002
I love my dad, but he is

52
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:02,303
a sick, twisted individual.

53
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:03,501
The only way to handle him

54
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:04,501
is to stand up to him.

55
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:05,500
Well, that's gonna be

56
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:06,801
kind of hard seeing

57
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:08,101
as he's kind of the coach.

58
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:09,801
- Don't worry.
- He's all bark and no bite.

59
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:11,102
Most of the time.

60
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:14,702
How about you come over tomorrow night?

61
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,103
I mean, is that gonna be okay

62
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:17,700
with your mom and your dad?

63
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,000
'Cause I don't know--

64
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,301
Matt, you gotta get out of that mindset.

65
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:22,702
Otherwise, he's just gonna squash this.

66
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:25,400
Uh, whatever,

67
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:26,200
whatever this is.

68
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:27,700
Right, and about that.

69
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:28,300
Um...

70
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:30,602
What happened on the field

71
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:31,502
the other night after the--

72
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:32,403
after the football game,

73
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:34,503
what I did, when I kissed you,
that was wrong.

74
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:36,202
And I just didn't want you to think that

75
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:38,002
I thought that maybe--

76
00:02:39,706 --> 00:02:40,802
That's what I think about it.

77
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:42,100
I'll see you later.

78
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:48,901
You okay?

79
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:49,401
Yeah.

80
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:50,803
Need any help?

81
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:52,300
No, I got it.

82
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:53,101
I got it.

83
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:55,600
All right, son.

84
00:02:55,605 --> 00:02:56,601
I don't know if I trust this thing.

85
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,301
Just special for you.

86
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:00,000
There you go.

87
00:03:00,808 --> 00:03:03,303
Here, let me get the door.

88
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:05,202
Good job on the ramp, Dad.

89
00:03:05,206 --> 00:03:05,901
Thank you, son.

90
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,602
Welcome home.

91
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:12,101
So what happened to your office?

92
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:14,501
Oh, I moved it upstairs.

93
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:15,503
No big deal.

94
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:17,003
Your mom did a pretty good job, huh?

95
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:21,902
Yeah, it's--
It's nice.

96
00:03:21,907 --> 00:03:22,602
Yeah.

97
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:24,601
- What do you want to put this?
- Just right there.

98
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:25,800
So, uh...

99
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,002
So I'll be using the guest bathroom?

100
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:28,900
Well, yeah.

101
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:29,500
Okay.

102
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:31,203
I mean, we're gonna convert

103
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:32,100
the utility closet just as soon

104
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:33,300
as we can afford it.

105
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:36,602
Why don't we let him get settled in?

106
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:38,901
And, uh...you got some barbecue, right?

107
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:40,501
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I have it in the fridge.

108
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:41,503
Okay.

109
00:03:41,507 --> 00:03:43,602
All right.

110
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:44,303
Thanks.

122
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:07,300
Can we please listen to

123
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,502
- something other than football?
- No.

124
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:09,900
It's giving me a headache.

125
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:11,200
Yes, we can, baby.

126
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,101
Do you want me to sing?

127
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:13,201
I love to sing.

128
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:14,203
No, please.

129
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:15,401
I'll be gone on Saturday.

130
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:16,501
Where are you going on Saturday?

131
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:18,603
There's this music
festival at Belton Lake.

132
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:20,103
Matt's gonna take me.

133
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:21,600
You're not going out
with Matt on Saturday.

134
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:23,603
We agreed that I get
one date a weekend.

135
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:24,403
Yeah, well, how you think

136
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,602
you're gonna get out to Belton Lake?

137
00:05:25,606 --> 00:05:27,000
Landry's gonna take us.

138
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:28,902
Who is Landry?

139
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:30,701
That Lance kid.

140
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:33,603
You're not going to
Belton Lake with Lance.

141
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:36,003
You won't be going out
with Matt Saracen on Saturday

142
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:37,802
because Matt Saracen's gonna be with me

143
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:40,000
at the cheerleading thing.

144
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:41,606
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.

145
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:42,504
We're all going.

146
00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:46,106
It's the Cheerleading
Divisional Championship.

147
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:47,003
No, it's not!

148
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:48,261
It's the Cheerleading Classic.

149
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,462
Well, I didn't read the whole email,

150
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:50,800
but it's important, and we're all going.

151
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:52,601
Let me think about that.

152
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:53,961
Pass.

153
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:55,902
Cheerleading is more
pointless than football.

154
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:57,261
That is a sexist--

155
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:58,403
a sexist remark

156
00:05:58,438 --> 00:05:59,560
that you just made.

157
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:00,652
They support us

158
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:01,661
every weekend.

159
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:03,500
Now it's time for us to support them.

160
00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:04,561
That's what's gonna happen.

161
00:06:04,606 --> 00:06:05,603
End of conversation.

162
00:06:05,636 --> 00:06:06,561
You people are sick.

163
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:07,903
And I want my own car.

164
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:09,200
She wants her own car.

165
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:11,400
Dream on, kid!

166
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:12,960
So I don't get it.

167
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,203
If we're suing 'cause we need money,

168
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:15,401
then how can we afford a lawyer?

169
00:06:15,435 --> 00:06:18,461
He doesn't get paid unless we win.

170
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:19,703
So what am I supposed to do?

171
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:20,902
Nothing, he just wants
to visit with you.

172
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:21,801
Ask you a few questions.

173
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:23,162
He's a really nice man.

174
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:24,602
He's already helped us out a lot.

175
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:25,463
You okay with this?

176
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:27,462
Tomorrow night at 7:00.

177
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:29,303
We'll both be here with you the entire time.

178
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:31,200
Doesn't hurt to hear him out.

179
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:33,101
Doesn't mean I like it.

180
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,602
Are you sure you're gonna
be okay here by yourself?

181
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:37,200
Mom.

182
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,501
You call me on my cell
if you need anything.

183
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:40,801
Mom, I can take care of myself, all right?

184
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,112
Promise.

185
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:44,001
I...I promise.

186
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,600
- Love you.
- Love you too.

187
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:53,701
- Have a good day.
- Call me!

188
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:54,461
Love you!

189
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:55,203
Okay.

190
00:06:57,206 --> 00:06:58,100
Have a good day.

191
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:11,052
Excuse me.

192
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:11,701
Hey!

193
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,360
Yo, new girl!

194
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:15,000
Where I'm supposed to be and like--

195
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:16,461
Hey, yo, hey, miss.

196
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:18,101
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't know your name yet.

197
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,401
All right, look.
Slow up, slow up.

198
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:21,561
Talk to the Smash.

199
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:23,201
All right, well, I'll call you
back later, okay?

200
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:24,403
All right, bye.

201
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:26,760
Well, isn't that cute?

202
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:28,402
Look, I'm just here to
bring out the welcome wagon.

203
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,102
Hold up. Waverly?

204
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:36,963
Hello, Brian.

205
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:38,160
Damn, girl!

206
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,662
Look, I don't know where you been,

207
00:07:39,705 --> 00:07:41,300
but time's sure been good to you.

208
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,100
Well, thank you.

209
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,300
- It's been a while, I know.
- It's been a little bit.

210
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:47,001
- It's been a little bit.
- Oh, there, hold on.

211
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:48,501
I gotta go, that's my dad.

212
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:49,411
I'll see you later.

213
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:50,420
Brian in the flesh.

214
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:51,401
How you doing, son?

215
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:53,461
I'm good, Pastor.

216
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:55,202
I see you catching up with my daughter.

217
00:07:55,236 --> 00:07:56,161
Yeah, we just--

218
00:07:56,206 --> 00:07:58,601
Yeah, we just catching up.

219
00:07:58,636 --> 00:07:59,263
All right.

220
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:00,702
You remember me now, right?

221
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:02,903
Oh, yeah.

222
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:04,602
You have a good day, all right?

223
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:05,601
Yes, sir.

224
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:06,303
Right.

225
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:09,701
Out of your league, Williams.

226
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:11,301
- You know that.
- No such thing.

227
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:13,701
Smash is one size fits all.

228
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:16,202
Ain't her dad a preacher?

229
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:17,361
What you know about it?

230
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:18,803
Last time you been
south of the border,

231
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:20,060
you was with your mama

232
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:21,553
on your very first birthday.

233
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,002
My mom lives in Oklahoma.

234
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:29,761
Hey, I bet you 100 bucks Saracen
gets up on Coach's daughter

235
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:33,501
before Smash even touches
that Waverly priss-ass Grady.

236
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:35,702
Mmm, done, baby.

237
00:08:36,205 --> 00:08:37,301
How about it, QB1?

238
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:39,601
Think you can get the v-chip out of Julie

239
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:40,602
before I can work my magic?

240
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:42,103
I think you should shut up.

241
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:42,662
Oh, come on, man.

242
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:44,461
You afraid of a little
bet or something?

243
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:45,800
I think it's a good time
to stop talking.

244
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:49,262
Come here.

245
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:51,203
Oh, we just talking
a little smack, Coach.

246
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:05,650
Five, six, seven, eight.

247
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:07,203
D.H.S.!

248
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:08,903
We're back again!

249
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:11,002
Blue and gold!

250
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:13,101
Let's win!

251
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:14,160
Panthers!

252
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,602
Let's practice our scales.

253
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:16,861
Y'all get in your stunt groups.

254
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:18,502
Don't worry about it.
Just be tight.

255
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:19,460
- You'll be fine.
- Sweet.

256
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:20,461
Maybe we get can some tips on...

257
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:21,800
- ... your favorite sexual position.
- Shut up, Brittany.

258
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:23,101
I'm tired of hearing it.

259
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:24,601
Wow, my arm's a little sore.

260
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:25,862
Hope I can hold the cradle.

261
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:31,501
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven--

262
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:33,613
Are you okay?

263
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:35,311
What the hell is your problem?!

264
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:36,741
It wasn't her. It was you.

265
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,670
Hey, enough! Quit it.

266
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:41,722
Hey! What is going on over here?

267
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:44,062
Anybody? Please enlighten me.

268
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:46,291
Whatever is going on
between you guys,

269
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:48,093
you need to work it out.

270
00:09:48,126 --> 00:09:51,161
Now we have been working
for this Saturday all year.

271
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:53,363
And I don't know what
you've been doing all week.

272
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:55,961
- Are you with this team?
- Yes, ma'am.

273
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,462
- You're sure.
- Yes, ma'am.

274
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:03,890
All right, then.
Let's do it again.

275
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:10,723
Hey, Jason!

276
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,161
How are you?

277
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:15,193
I'm fine.

278
00:10:15,225 --> 00:10:17,422
I missed you guys.

279
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:21,022
Look, he's back.
I told you he would be.

280
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,761
Hey, squirt.

281
00:10:22,797 --> 00:10:24,022
Been watching the Cowboys this year?

282
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:26,392
Yeah.

283
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,923
Can you walk?

284
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:29,662
Jake, that's not very nice.

285
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,062
- Sorry.
- It's okay. It's all right.

286
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,623
No, buddy, I can't yet.

287
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,590
But, uh...

288
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:39,760
I bet I could beat you in a race.

289
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:45,761
Come on, buddy.

290
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:58,523
All right, you got me that time.

291
00:10:58,565 --> 00:10:59,821
Want to do it again?

292
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,122
I probably shouldn't, buddy.

293
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,663
I don't sweat like normal people anymore.

294
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:05,360
Come on, it's time for your snacks anyway.

295
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,121
You guys can play later, all right?

296
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,090
All right. See you later, Jason.

297
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,223
Hey, Jake, don't play
in the street, all right?

298
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:14,290
- That's a one-time thing.
- All right, bye.

299
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:38,760
Hey.

300
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,293
Hi.

301
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:44,763
I have nothing to say to you.

302
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:50,522
Don't come back here.

303
00:11:58,605 --> 00:12:01,042
Note Homer's double standard in how Ulysses

304
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:03,213
is treated with extreme forgiveness

305
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:06,511
for his dalliance with Circe in the Odyssey.

306
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:08,181
Yeah, well, Ulysses was a pimp.

307
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:11,361
Look, I'm just saying.

308
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,190
It's all about the seed and the egg.

309
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:14,491
You know, the flower and the bee.

310
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:16,530
A man's job is to spread the pollen

311
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,760
and the woman's job is to grow it.

312
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:21,391
But you can only grow
one seed at a time, right?

313
00:12:21,437 --> 00:12:23,513
I--I don't follow you exactly.

314
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,192
What I was trying--

315
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:27,830
I think what he's trying
to say is that

316
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:29,191
monogamy isn't natural.

317
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:32,693
The male species is hardwired
for genetic diversity.

318
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:35,631
So the instinct is to, you know,

319
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,531
fertilize as many eggs
as possible, to have sex.

320
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:40,432
Exactly.

321
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:43,330
Yeah, but human beings are different.

322
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:45,132
I mean, civilization is based

323
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,731
on the repression of instincts.

324
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:48,832
When we act contrary to our instincts,

325
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:50,963
that's when things get interesting.

326
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:53,490
A lot of people would say that monogamy

327
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:55,863
is a state of higher evolution.

328
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:59,131
With the right person.

329
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:07,661
What's up, baby? Listen.

330
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:12,492
I'm having a party. You should come.

331
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:14,462
We should kick it like a football, baby.

332
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:15,960
We're gonna have a little pool
party, a little suds

333
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,061
and buds, if you know
what I'm talking about.

334
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:18,592
No.

335
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:20,533
Everybody's cool with your little trip.

336
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,061
If that's what you're into.

337
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:23,661
But I'm not gonna judge it.

338
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:25,032
I love it-- 
What's up?

339
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:28,192
What's up?

340
00:13:28,236 --> 00:13:31,091
What's up, Riggs?

341
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:34,363
I was just leaving.

342
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:46,412
Man. What are you doing?

343
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:49,843
Don't you know you're sitting
with the school slut?

344
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:54,681
Let 'em look, Lyla.
I don't care.

345
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:03,711
It's different for girls.

346
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:05,640
You can sleep around all you want

347
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:07,511
and people think you're cool.

348
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:09,740
I make one mistake--

349
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:12,342
And it was a mistake.

350
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:19,582
Tim, you're making it worse.

351
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:21,210
You can't be here.

352
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:32,412
What the hell was that?

353
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:33,583
What are you talking about?

354
00:14:33,617 --> 00:14:35,142
Sitting with Lyla in the cafeteria.

355
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:38,042
Don't you know you're just
making this worse for her?

356
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:39,441
Yeah, she kind of
just mentioned that.

357
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:40,813
Why don't you stay away
from her, then?

358
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,143
Stay out of it.

359
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,041
You're in love with her.

360
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:54,242
Yeah.

361
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:03,081
What do you got?

362
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:04,412
Oh, good, good, good.

363
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,482
That's what I thought,
that you had that one.

364
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:09,581
- Sweet.
- Good job, sir.

365
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,210
- Good day.
- Is that 12?

366
00:15:11,246 --> 00:15:12,481
It was 12.

367
00:15:12,516 --> 00:15:14,641
Oh, yeah, that's what we like to hear.

368
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:16,641
Hello, Ben. Ben Beck.

369
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:17,743
Long time no see.

370
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,983
Now I will warn you, I am hot.

371
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:21,780
You walk in here tonight,
you may drive out

372
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:24,111
in a new truck, I'm not kidding you.

373
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:27,183
Are you all right, partner?

374
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:28,480
You look like you just seen a ghost.

375
00:15:28,518 --> 00:15:29,942
I want you to know.

376
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:32,693
Brittany put some stuff
on the internet about Lyla.

377
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:35,343
Other kids added to it, but

378
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:38,460
I'm pretty sure Brittany's
the one who started it.

379
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:39,881
Stuff on the internet.

380
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:43,443
What--what are you talking about, Ben?

381
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:47,441
It's bad. I'm not gonna lie to you.

382
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:49,380
Alice is home with her right now

383
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:52,810
trying to figure out what
in God's name possessed her.

384
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:55,382
I felt like I owed you
an apology in person.

385
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:58,713
Lyla doesn't deserve this.

386
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:00,743
No matter what she did.

387
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:02,610
It was medieval.

388
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:03,742
You know, it was like The Scarlet Letter

389
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:05,280
or something watching that girl

390
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:07,841
walk across the cafeteria

391
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:10,213
and everybody just glared at her.

392
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:11,482
That's high school.

393
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:13,210
At least they didn't
burn her at the goal post.

394
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:15,341
I'm telling you--

395
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:17,240
Go see who that is, please.

396
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:22,483
Uh, hey, sir.

397
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:25,312
Ma'am.

398
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:28,681
I was just wondering--

399
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:31,510
Sorry, I was just wondering if--

400
00:16:31,545 --> 00:16:32,841
Is Julie here?

401
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:34,913
Hey, Matt.
Hi, Dad.

402
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:38,341
Me and Matt are gonna go watch some TV.

403
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:40,881
If that's okay.

404
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,283
Hey, Mom.

405
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:43,542
We're gonna watch some TV.

406
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,010
Hi, Mrs. Coach.

407
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,042
All right, um, well--

408
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:50,641
What about tackling drills?

409
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:52,243
Y'all do a lot of those?

410
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:53,883
Yes, sir, every day,
every single day.

411
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:56,783
Coach used to always yell
at practice that, uh,

412
00:16:56,818 --> 00:16:59,340
"Good defense wins football games."

413
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,483
I mean you personally.

414
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:02,683
Me personally?

415
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,512
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- Tackling drills?

416
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,143
I was the quarterback.

417
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:13,181
Yeah, I realize that.

418
00:17:13,217 --> 00:17:15,512
But I was just wondering if at any time

419
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:17,712
during a practice or a scrimmage

420
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,310
or really any time at all

421
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:20,640
before you got hurt in that game,

422
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:23,982
did Coach Taylor ever
personally instruct you,

423
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:26,641
Jason Street, on how to make a tackle?

424
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:27,883
He didn't have to.

425
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:29,741
Okay.

426
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:33,082
Because I played quarterback.

427
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:34,782
Okay, so that's a no.

428
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:36,912
I guess so, I--

429
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:43,381
Are you trying to say this
is Coach Taylor's fault?

430
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,713
No, no, I'm just trying
to find out what happened.

431
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:47,441
'Cause I threw the interception.

432
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:48,982
And I got pissed off and I
went and tackled somebody.

433
00:17:49,016 --> 00:17:51,043
That was--
that's how it happened.

434
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:52,843
I know, I know, but when
you tackled him

435
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:55,142
you had your head down because no one

436
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:56,580
had ever taught you any other way--

437
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:57,981
I cannot believe this--
you said if we were gonna

438
00:17:58,018 --> 00:17:59,183
sue anybody, it was gonna be
the school, Dad.

439
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:00,843
We said nothing about Coach Taylor.

440
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:02,480
Jason, take it easy.

441
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,181
This was not Coach Taylor's fault.

442
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:05,981
Coach Taylor did not
make that tackle, I did.

443
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,382
I know, and--

444
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:10,982
Sir...sir...y'all--
y'all can try and get me to say

445
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:12,313
whatever you want me to say,

446
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:14,642
but I'm not gonna say
that it was Coach's fault.

447
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:16,711
All I want you to do is tell the truth.

448
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:20,613
And that's what you've done, right?

449
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:25,713
Honey, will you stop pacing, please?

450
00:18:25,748 --> 00:18:27,213
What do you suppose they're doing in there?

451
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:28,843
Probably having sex.

452
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:31,681
That's not funny.

453
00:18:31,718 --> 00:18:32,912
Well, it's a little bit funny.

454
00:18:32,948 --> 00:18:34,913
- That's not funny.
- Sit down and play cards.

455
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,412
I don't like the fact
that he just shows up here.

456
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:37,642
That's not right.

457
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:39,282
Well, I don't necessarily
like it much either.

458
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:40,482
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go out there.

459
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,013
Come back here right now.

460
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:43,710
I'll be back in a second,
I'ma get something to drink--

461
00:18:43,745 --> 00:18:44,780
Don't go out there.
Don't--

462
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:46,582
You--you warm enough?

463
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:47,843
Yeah, I'm good.

464
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:50,180
All right.

465
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:52,110
Hey, how we doing out here?

466
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:53,741
Uh, good.

467
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:56,340
We're just watching TV.

468
00:18:56,387 --> 00:18:57,382
What's with the blanket?

469
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:58,442
Who told you you could
get a blanket out?

470
00:18:58,486 --> 00:18:59,781
It's cold in here.

471
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:01,182
That's 'cause I like
to keep the AC low.

472
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:02,481
Yeah, hence the blanket.

473
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,643
How much longer till
the program's over, honey?

474
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:05,543
Dad.

475
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:06,680
It's a school night, honey.

476
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:09,213
It's 9:00, Dad.

477
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:10,442
Yeah, but I probably...

478
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:12,312
I should probably get going
home anyway though.

479
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:13,841
No, no, no, you really
don't have to.

480
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:16,983
No, no, no, I don't like to
leave my grandma home at night.

481
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:19,010
So it's probably better--

482
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:21,581
Will you just tell--

483
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,642
Good night, Mrs. Taylor.

484
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:23,940
Oh, good night, Matt.

485
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:28,880
I'll see you tomorrow.

486
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,710
Good night, Coach.

487
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:32,113
Bye, Matt.

488
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:33,242
I'll see you tomorrow.

489
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:34,682
Bye, Matt.

490
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,613
Thanks.

491
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:44,543
Sorry, babe.

492
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:49,380
They had a blanket.

493
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:52,483
You're an idiot.

494
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:07,581
- Hey, you.
- Hey, Daddy.

495
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:12,280
You okay?

496
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:13,482
Yeah.

497
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:16,113
Just doing some research.

498
00:20:21,745 --> 00:20:25,113
Um, Mom and I, we're turning in.

499
00:20:25,147 --> 00:20:27,442
Good night, Daddy.

500
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:28,713
Good night, baby.

501
00:20:28,747 --> 00:20:31,212
We'll see you in the morning.

502
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,692
All right, thank you, ladies.
Can I have your attention?

503
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:19,931
We're hunting for a big "W"
this weekend.

504
00:21:19,968 --> 00:21:21,492
But I think everyone should
know that these ladies

505
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:23,740
sitting up front right here
also are gonna be hunting

506
00:21:23,778 --> 00:21:25,901
for their own "W" this weekend.

507
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:28,003
Because Saturday they're gonna be

508
00:21:28,007 --> 00:21:30,940
at the Cheer America
Championship Classic.

509
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:34,421
Suzanne, if you'd step up here.

510
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:36,090
Ms. Der, if you'd step up here please.

511
00:21:36,105 --> 00:21:38,032
Let's give a big hand.
Suzanne.

512
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:45,280
From the team, I just want to say--

513
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:48,733
I want to say from us to you,

514
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:51,290
good luck, go get 'em,

515
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:52,963
and this time we're gonna
be supporting you.

516
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:54,700
All right?

517
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:59,161
Well, thank you, Coach.

518
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:02,463
Just one more thing.

519
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:04,231
Ladies!

520
00:22:28,668 --> 00:22:31,001
Blue! Gold!

521
00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:32,731
Go, Panthers!

522
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:35,003
<i>Blue! Gold!</i>

523
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:38,293
Go, Panthers!

524
00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:42,362
Go, Panthers! Go, Panthers!

525
00:22:42,397 --> 00:22:47,401
Go, Panthers! Go, Panthers, Go!

526
00:22:47,938 --> 00:22:49,960
Matt Saracen's got some nice looking legs.

527
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:51,660
Go, Panthers!

528
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:53,632
Go, Panthers!

529
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:13,431
Hey, where's Lyla?

530
00:23:13,468 --> 00:23:15,592
How should I know?

531
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:18,061
I don't know. She's not out there.

532
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:28,960
Hi, Lyla. Missed you at the pep rally.

533
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,560
What's the matter?

534
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,262
Well, that's just bush league.

535
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:41,032
We don't listen to those jackasses.

536
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:42,332
Come on.

537
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:44,903
I just thought, let 'em talk, you know?

538
00:23:44,938 --> 00:23:50,130
Let 'em say what they're
gonna say, and I'll just...

539
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,731
tough it out.

540
00:23:55,497 --> 00:23:59,033
I'm quitting the cheerleading team.

541
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:03,801
That's a big move.

542
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:05,291
Sure you want to do that?

543
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:10,002
My parents dressed me up
in cheerleader outfits

544
00:24:10,036 --> 00:24:13,101
and took me to Panthers
games since I was five.

545
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:16,233
Becoming a cheerleader for
the Dillon Panthers was like

546
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:18,801
this dream come true.

547
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:21,262
And I bought into it.

548
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:22,762
But you know what?

549
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:26,360
The truth is since Jason's accident,

550
00:24:26,395 --> 00:24:29,693
I've been pretending.

551
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,691
And I am done pretending,
Mrs. Taylor,

552
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,393
that I care about any of this.

553
00:24:41,265 --> 00:24:42,963
Come on, Smash, get out there!

554
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,433
Go!

555
00:24:56,838 --> 00:24:58,662
What was that number?

556
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,232
- 4-4 something.
- What?

557
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,532
- 4-4-6.
- Let me see that.

558
00:25:04,596 --> 00:25:06,593
Damn, either they're getting
slower or he's getting faster.

559
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:07,733
One or the other.

560
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:08,962
Must be eating his Wheaties.

561
00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:11,091
Whatever he's eating, let's
make sure he keeps eating them.

562
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,860
Hey, that's nice, Smash.
Come on, set it up again now.

563
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:25,393
What?

564
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:27,263
- I just need to talk to you for a minute.
- Go ahead.

565
00:25:27,297 --> 00:25:29,633
Look, I don't want this
whole thing to be awkward.

566
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:31,760
You don't want what to be awkward?

567
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:33,832
This whole thing between Julie and I.

568
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,363
- Julie and me.
- Huh?

569
00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:37,661
It's Julie and me.
It's a common mistake.

570
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:40,201
- Go ahead.
- Right, it's just--

571
00:25:40,236 --> 00:25:42,233
Look, I'm kind of sensing that--

572
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:45,732
I'm sensing that you have a problem with it.

573
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:47,493
You're sensing right.

574
00:25:47,536 --> 00:25:50,560
We're both interested in each other, okay?

575
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:52,961
And--and I'm not gonna stop seeing her

576
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:55,102
because of you or because
of anybody else--

577
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,632
Saracen, stop right there.

578
00:25:57,665 --> 00:25:59,033
If I don't want you seeing my daughter,

579
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:00,332
you're not gonna see my daughter.

580
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:02,260
- No, you don't understand--
- You can go now.

581
00:26:02,296 --> 00:26:03,592
I don't think you heard what I said.

582
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:05,262
You can go now.

583
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:06,493
- But--
- You can go now.

584
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:07,830
Have you talked with Jason?

585
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:10,162
No.

586
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:13,903
He won't even come near me.

587
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:16,263
Sweetheart...

588
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:19,362
Listen, look at me.

589
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:21,463
I know you feel awful.

590
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,532
Okay?

591
00:26:22,568 --> 00:26:24,101
If there was some magic thing

592
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:25,800
I could do to make all this go away,

593
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:26,961
believe me, I would do it.

594
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:28,900
But I can't.

595
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:31,203
You made a mistake and it's over.

596
00:26:31,238 --> 00:26:32,460
And the important thing is

597
00:26:32,498 --> 00:26:35,002
is that you learn something from it.

598
00:26:35,035 --> 00:26:37,532
You know what my mama used to say?

599
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:41,833
God created sin so that we
might know His mercy.

600
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:50,062
- Okay.
- Okay?

601
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,693
Hold up. Where's the okra?

602
00:26:51,738 --> 00:26:52,902
I've been making this gumbo

603
00:26:52,938 --> 00:26:55,200
since Michael Jackson
had a nose like yours.

604
00:26:55,235 --> 00:26:56,630
You're messing me up now.

605
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,360
Sheila, look, you can't
dress like that for Pastor.

606
00:26:58,398 --> 00:26:59,560
You get changed.
I'll finish this up.

607
00:26:59,595 --> 00:27:00,960
And you're just running around here.

608
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:04,801
Go calm down somewhere.
And Sheila looks fine.

609
00:27:04,838 --> 00:27:06,290
She look all right.

610
00:27:06,337 --> 00:27:08,561
Did you hear that?

611
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:12,360
Coming!

612
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,460
Hey, how you doing, Brian?
You all right?

613
00:27:14,497 --> 00:27:16,562
Good to see you, son.

614
00:27:16,596 --> 00:27:18,161
- Hey, what's up, Wave.
- Hi.

615
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:19,562
- Family dinner.
- Yeah, a little something.

616
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:22,203
Nice, very nice.

617
00:27:22,237 --> 00:27:24,231
Oh, Lord, bless this food,
sanctify it.

618
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,531
Let it be nourishment to our
bodies, minds and spirits.

619
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:27,563
In Jesus' name we pray you thanks.

620
00:27:27,597 --> 00:27:29,332
-Amen.
-Amen.

621
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:30,633
All right, spill it, Wave.

622
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:32,490
Now, Brian, we just sat down here.

623
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:33,903
It's all right, Mama.

624
00:27:33,937 --> 00:27:35,290
I just want to know
what she been up to.

625
00:27:35,335 --> 00:27:37,930
I think Daddy would rather
talk about football.

626
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:39,691
You were in Africa, right?

627
00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:41,001
It was kind of missionary work?

628
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,731
No, it was actually like

629
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:44,761
a Christian outreach program.

630
00:27:44,808 --> 00:27:46,462
- Okay.
- Got a friend of mine.

631
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:48,000
He's a big, you know, muckety-muck

632
00:27:48,037 --> 00:27:49,633
in the Episcopal Church.

633
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,461
And they do a lot of helping people out.

634
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:53,290
They're building houses and hospitals.

635
00:27:53,336 --> 00:27:55,663
And so they took my baby girl away.

636
00:27:55,697 --> 00:27:57,630
You know, they got a lot of resources.

637
00:27:57,665 --> 00:27:59,693
Doing things that we can't do,

638
00:27:59,736 --> 00:28:00,930
so you know how it is.

639
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:03,562
So what was it like?
I mean, you got any pictures?

640
00:28:03,596 --> 00:28:06,390
Shoot, I've never even been outside Texas.

641
00:28:06,438 --> 00:28:07,363
I don't know.

642
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:10,462
It was fun, hard work, nice people.

643
00:28:10,495 --> 00:28:12,491
Well, you know, since she's back

644
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:14,163
we're trying to re-focus

645
00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:16,261
and get our eyes back on this college thing.

646
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:17,760
Oh, I know that's right.

647
00:28:17,806 --> 00:28:19,262
Education goes a long way.

648
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,863
Football don't last forever.

649
00:28:20,905 --> 00:28:22,291
You know, since you mentioned that,

650
00:28:22,338 --> 00:28:24,532
Brian, how's that SAT class going?

651
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:29,362
Oh, it's good. It's going real good.

652
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:46,430
Yes?

653
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:55,462
I guess--I guess what
I came here to tell you

654
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:59,563
is that Lyla is completely
in love with you.

655
00:28:59,597 --> 00:29:02,463
And always has been and always will be.

656
00:29:02,497 --> 00:29:05,332
She's going through hell right now, Street.

657
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:08,802
Hell.

658
00:29:08,836 --> 00:29:10,731
I'm sure she is.

659
00:29:10,766 --> 00:29:13,360
People at school are just ripping on her.

660
00:29:13,396 --> 00:29:16,560
I mean, she quit cheer. She's losing it.

661
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:20,902
And I know it means probably
nothing coming from me.

662
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:24,862
But I thought you should know.

663
00:29:24,908 --> 00:29:28,861
Well, I'm sure you can
help her out with that.

664
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:33,762
I messed up.

665
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:35,900
- Tim--
- I messed up big time.

666
00:29:37,537 --> 00:29:40,393
And I'm sorry.

667
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:43,691
Not right now.

668
00:29:59,008 --> 00:30:00,032
Hey, morning, babe.

669
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:01,191
Listen, we need to get going early today.

670
00:30:01,238 --> 00:30:02,762
The brake fluid lights are on the truck.

671
00:30:02,797 --> 00:30:03,830
I gotta pick some up.

672
00:30:03,866 --> 00:30:04,902
You need to tell me when that happens.

673
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:05,903
- I did tell you.
- I have a ride.

674
00:30:05,935 --> 00:30:07,361
You have a ride? With who?

675
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,361
With Matt.

676
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,032
And we're going to the movies on Saturday.

677
00:30:11,065 --> 00:30:12,162
Excuse me?

678
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,463
Saturday, we're going to the movies,

679
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:15,502
and we'll be back for the cheerleading thing.

680
00:30:15,535 --> 00:30:17,961
And there. So I'm gonna go.

681
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:19,762
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

682
00:30:19,806 --> 00:30:20,830
Where are you going,

683
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:22,102
and are they here?

684
00:30:22,138 --> 00:30:24,301
Out front? What--honey...honey...

685
00:30:24,335 --> 00:30:26,501
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!

686
00:30:26,537 --> 00:30:28,362
Hey, how y'all doin'?

687
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:30,500
Coach.
Miss--Mrs. Coach.

688
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,833
Julie...Julie...

689
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:36,530
Who is that other one in the--

690
00:30:36,565 --> 00:30:38,802
Who's driving the car?

691
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,361
- Y'all please drive safely!
- See y'all later.

692
00:30:40,408 --> 00:30:42,762
Watch the curb, whoever you are.

693
00:30:45,555 --> 00:30:46,281
Tell you what I'm gonna do

694
00:30:46,287 --> 00:30:47,371
is I'm gonna have a talk with that boy.

695
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,013
You're gonna have a talk with Matt Saracen?

696
00:30:49,028 --> 00:30:50,520
I'm gonna have a Matt chat
is what I'm gonna do.

697
00:30:50,556 --> 00:30:51,883
I'm gonna have a little Matt chat.

698
00:30:51,926 --> 00:30:53,783
Sounds like a truly terrible idea.

699
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,131
Wescott's last five games.

700
00:30:55,165 --> 00:30:57,100
I want you to take a look
at those over the weekend,

701
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:58,332
and Monday morning, first thing,

702
00:30:58,368 --> 00:30:59,892
I want you to be able to talk about

703
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:01,303
their defense knowledgably.

704
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:04,260
Y-y-you want me
to do this over the weekend?

705
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:05,600
That's right. Is that a problem?

706
00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:10,102
I--I kinda had plans
with Julie this weekend.

707
00:31:11,108 --> 00:31:12,962
Oh.

708
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:14,733
Well, I wasn't aware of that.

709
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:17,902
But I do know that you're QB1

710
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:18,860
on the Dillon Panthers,

711
00:31:18,905 --> 00:31:20,292
and this team's got a damn good chance

712
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,232
of making the playoffs.

713
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:22,962
So I'm sure you'll prioritize.

714
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:26,193
Yes, sir.

715
00:31:28,737 --> 00:31:29,792
We're gonna go get 'em tonight.

716
00:31:29,837 --> 00:31:31,763
I told you, I'm not going
all the way over there

717
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,163
for some stupid football game.

718
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:34,361
Then how about after?

719
00:31:34,408 --> 00:31:35,453
I'll pick you up at your house.

720
00:31:35,555 --> 00:31:36,053
Hey, Smash.

721
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:38,381
- Hey. 
- Have a great game tonight.

722
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:39,342
I will.

723
00:31:39,385 --> 00:31:41,211
And we will be watching.

724
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:43,211
Don't--don't even worry about them.

725
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:44,280
Don't even worry about them.

726
00:31:44,315 --> 00:31:46,580
Okay, look, we had dinner,

727
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:47,810
and you asked me all your questions.

728
00:31:47,845 --> 00:31:49,241
And blah, blah, blah.
We caught up.

729
00:31:49,286 --> 00:31:50,981
So just go score some goals.

730
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:52,383
You know I ain't gonna
give up that easy.

731
00:31:52,415 --> 00:31:54,483
Smash don't take no for an answer.

732
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:55,842
Yeah, but he loves to refer to himself

733
00:31:55,887 --> 00:31:56,981
in the third person.

734
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,151
Which, by the way,

735
00:31:58,188 --> 00:31:59,283
is incredibly annoying.

736
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:00,883
Right now, Smash! Coach is pissed!

737
00:32:00,915 --> 00:32:02,713
- Bus is leaving.
- I'll be right there, sir!

738
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:03,882
- Hurry up!
- I'm comin'!

739
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:05,383
Miniature golf.

740
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:06,910
You and me.

741
00:32:06,945 --> 00:32:10,583
Nobody from the team. No football talk.

742
00:32:10,616 --> 00:32:12,541
What do you say? We on?

743
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:14,610
I'll think about it.

744
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:19,482
<i>Well, the game's over,
and the Dillon Panthers</i>

745
00:32:19,516 --> 00:32:22,441
<i>put a world of hurt on the
winless Timberwolves tonight.</i>

746
00:32:22,588 --> 00:32:25,012
<i>First quarter, Matt Saracen
gives to Smash Williams</i>

747
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:27,183
<i>for an easy score
and an early seven-points lead.</i>

748
00:32:27,217 --> 00:32:28,241
Fix it.

749
00:32:28,288 --> 00:32:29,411
<i>And that was the story tonight</i>

750
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:30,712
<i>as young Mr. Williams</i>

751
00:32:30,747 --> 00:32:32,810
<i>lit the Timberwolves defense up</i>

752
00:32:32,848 --> 00:32:34,152
<i>for 166 yards rushing,,</i>

753
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:36,182
- Good game. 
<i>- Seven receptions,</i>

754
00:32:36,218 --> 00:32:39,012
<i>and three, count 'em, three touchdowns.</i>

755
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:40,712
<i>Halftime featured a performance</i>

756
00:32:40,746 --> 00:32:42,053
<i>by the Dillon JC Drill Team,</i>

757
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:43,582
<i>who are competing in tomorrow's</i>

758
00:32:43,617 --> 00:32:45,580
<i>Cheer America Championship Classic.</i>

759
00:32:45,618 --> 00:32:46,280
Get up.

760
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:49,051
- Matthew.
- Yeah?

761
00:32:49,085 --> 00:32:50,580
Okay, your part's starting.

762
00:32:50,617 --> 00:32:52,711
What did I tell you? Huh?

763
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:55,053
If you move those feet--
look at that.

764
00:32:56,415 --> 00:32:58,343
I gotta watch these game tapes, okay?

765
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:17,982
Oh! Oh, that's--

766
00:33:18,018 --> 00:33:19,312
I got my eyes set on UT now.

767
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:20,640
Oh, yeah? That's a really good school.

768
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:21,713
You think you have a chance?

769
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:22,883
Hell, yeah.

770
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,713
Long as I stay healthy and get my touches.

771
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:28,053
Well, no, I meant academically.

772
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:30,010
'Cause it's really hard
to get in there now,

773
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:31,480
even if you are in-state.

774
00:33:31,518 --> 00:33:34,481
Yeah, well, I'm working
on my studies and stuff.

775
00:33:34,518 --> 00:33:36,413
All right, you might wanna start
by doing your homework.

776
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:40,680
You, uh...

777
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:42,442
still thinking about med school?

778
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:45,512
Wow, you don't forget anything, do you?

779
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:46,540
Steel trap, baby.

780
00:33:46,585 --> 00:33:47,981
Steel trap.

781
00:33:48,017 --> 00:33:50,082
I still remember when we first moved here.

782
00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:51,840
Ooh, yes.

783
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:53,310
It'd be you, Sheila,

784
00:33:53,346 --> 00:33:55,883
and Missy in the back of the choir room

785
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:56,782
playing doctor.

786
00:33:56,816 --> 00:33:58,243
You never let me play, though.

787
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:00,711
Well, that's because you
always wanted to play dirty,

788
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:02,782
and we were running
a nice, clean hospital.

789
00:34:02,815 --> 00:34:04,210
It ain't my fault you always
needed an operation, baby.

790
00:34:04,247 --> 00:34:05,380
I was just trying to help you out.

791
00:34:05,415 --> 00:34:07,041
Whatever.

792
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:11,011
I don't know.
People change, and..

793
00:34:11,058 --> 00:34:13,383
that may not be the best thing
for me right now.

794
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:15,882
Although I know it would
make Daddy happy.

795
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:17,442
Yeah, well, your dad is the man.

796
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,240
I mean, letting you go
to Africa and all.

797
00:34:20,286 --> 00:34:23,083
I guess.

798
00:34:23,118 --> 00:34:25,341
You know, most people
who do something like that

799
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:27,080
talk about it all the time.

800
00:34:27,117 --> 00:34:28,342
You know, letting you know

801
00:34:28,387 --> 00:34:30,383
how in touch with their roots they are.

802
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,013
Hey, girls, look, it's Smash.

803
00:34:32,057 --> 00:34:33,112
And you don't want to talk about it.

804
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:34,210
Hey!

805
00:34:34,248 --> 00:34:36,712
Hey. Good game. That was awesome.

806
00:34:36,745 --> 00:34:37,740
Hey, look, we going all the way to state.

807
00:34:37,788 --> 00:34:38,781
Oh, yeah, we are.

808
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:39,782
Pack your bags, baby.

809
00:34:39,816 --> 00:34:41,743
Pack your pompoms.

810
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,981
Make sure to bring a swimsuit too.

811
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:46,713
Sorry, I get a little bit
excited about it.

812
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:48,781
Hey... your nose is bleeding.

813
00:34:48,816 --> 00:34:49,743
You okay?

814
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,413
- I'm cool, I'm cool.
- Sit down for a second.

815
00:34:54,448 --> 00:34:57,081
Sorry, this is a little embarrassing.

816
00:34:58,186 --> 00:34:59,581
You know,

817
00:34:59,618 --> 00:35:01,152
I don't think you spent that money

818
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:04,210
on an SAT class.

819
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:05,511
Yeah?

820
00:35:06,845 --> 00:35:09,211
Well, I'm...

821
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:13,782
I'm starting to think
you didn't go to Africa.

822
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:18,682
Please say something.

823
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,150
What do you want me to say, Lyla?

824
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,282
That everything's fine?

825
00:35:21,317 --> 00:35:24,053
'Cause I'm sorry, I can't do it.

826
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,641
I don't lie as well as you do.

827
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:30,912
I'm so sorry.

828
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:33,482
It was one mistake.

829
00:35:33,516 --> 00:35:34,641
One mistake...

830
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:36,713
would have been you cheating on me.

831
00:35:36,747 --> 00:35:38,911
But two was when

832
00:35:38,947 --> 00:35:40,440
- Please stop.
- you lied to me.

833
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:42,640
Three was when I found out
it was with my best friend.

834
00:35:42,685 --> 00:35:44,641
What else you gotta tell me, huh?

835
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:46,082
What else you wanna get off your chest

836
00:35:46,117 --> 00:35:47,281
while you're out here
feeling sorry for yourself?

837
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:48,883
I was there for you, Jason!

838
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:51,212
I was the only one
that was there for you!

839
00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:52,882
Every single day!

840
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:55,080
I was there for you every night!

841
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:57,412
I made one mistake!

842
00:35:57,445 --> 00:35:58,582
That's great. You want credit?

843
00:35:58,618 --> 00:35:59,642
You want credit for sticking by me?

844
00:35:59,686 --> 00:36:02,340
I did not ask for this.

845
00:36:02,386 --> 00:36:04,513
And I damn sure did not ask

846
00:36:04,548 --> 00:36:07,541
for the one person in this world that I loved

847
00:36:07,587 --> 00:36:10,210
to break my friggin' heart.

848
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:15,282
I didn't ask for this either, Jason.

849
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:20,682
Seeing you in that hospital
broke my heart.

850
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:24,913
I was so lost and alone.

851
00:36:24,946 --> 00:36:27,052
And I screwed up.

852
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:31,240
And if you choose to never
forgive me for that,

853
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:32,543
I understand.

854
00:36:35,285 --> 00:36:37,910
Believe me when I say
that you are all that I have

855
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,913
in the whole world.

856
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,581
All I have.

857
00:36:50,718 --> 00:36:51,842
I just can't.

858
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:53,341
I can't!

859
00:36:54,648 --> 00:36:56,441
I just can't.

860
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:16,452
And we are here to represent
the Panthers, right?

861
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,203
All right, let's go. Come on, girls!

862
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:32,102
Hey, hey! Here we go!

863
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:37,793
- Honey, you're late. We got to go.
- I know I'm late.

864
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:38,910
We started at the crack of dawn,

865
00:37:38,915 --> 00:37:40,480
and the round took six hours.

866
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:41,712
- Slow over there.
- How'd you play?

867
00:37:41,756 --> 00:37:43,352
I don't wanna talk about it.

868
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:44,552
I'll tell you what we gotta do, though,

869
00:37:44,588 --> 00:37:46,882
is I gotta--I gotta maybe
sell the house,

870
00:37:46,918 --> 00:37:48,113
and then I get a membership

871
00:37:48,157 --> 00:37:49,181
over at Buddy's country club.

872
00:37:49,215 --> 00:37:50,752
What we need to do is
we need to go.

873
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:52,253
You want me to make you a sandwich?

874
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:53,210
Yeah.

875
00:37:53,257 --> 00:37:54,151
- Well, hurry up.
- No tomato, please.

876
00:37:54,186 --> 00:37:55,713
- Mustard.
- Well, hurry it up,

877
00:37:55,716 --> 00:37:57,233
because we got to go.

878
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:58,761
- The cheerleading thing is now.
- Where's Julie?

879
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:00,660
Well, our daughter Julie
is going to meet us there

880
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:01,792
because she's getting a ride

881
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:03,400
with Matt Saracen.

882
00:38:04,336 --> 00:38:05,783
What do you mean, a ride with Matt?

883
00:38:05,787 --> 00:38:07,291
Well, she's been over at his house

884
00:38:07,297 --> 00:38:08,792
all morning long, going over

885
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:11,492
some game tapes that, uh, you gave him

886
00:38:11,526 --> 00:38:13,022
to work on this weekend?

887
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:14,600
- Oh.
- Hmm.

888
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:15,571
Yeah, well, I didn't know that--

889
00:38:15,616 --> 00:38:17,541
Yeah, apparently the Matt chat

890
00:38:17,577 --> 00:38:18,592
didn't go as well as you expected.

891
00:38:18,598 --> 00:38:20,422
Oh, and she wanted me to tell you to go

892
00:38:20,468 --> 00:38:22,763
right strong ISO when you're
in the nickel package.

893
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:25,093
apparently, they got a corner
that's short and slow.

894
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:26,422
So your daughter is now
interested in football,

895
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:29,430
which is another thing
you got going for you.

896
00:38:29,755 --> 00:38:31,021
- She said that?
- Mm-hmm.

897
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:32,592
- She said it like that?
- Good job, coach.

898
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:34,591
That's pretty good.

899
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:38,722
Ma'am.

900
00:38:39,668 --> 00:38:40,640
I'm sorry to bother you.

901
00:38:40,646 --> 00:38:41,741
What do you want, son?

902
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,872
Sir, I just want a minute
with your daughter, sir.

903
00:38:43,915 --> 00:38:45,242
What are you doing here?

904
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:46,770
Guys, I'll be right out.

905
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:48,711
I'll be right out.

906
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:54,010
You know that cheerleading
thing you have today?

907
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:55,213
- Regionals.
- The championships?

908
00:38:55,247 --> 00:38:56,571
I think you should go.

909
00:38:56,616 --> 00:38:58,078
Why?

910
00:38:58,078 --> 00:38:59,942
Because you're an amazing cheerleader,

911
00:38:59,977 --> 00:39:01,712
and I think you have that same feeling

912
00:39:01,745 --> 00:39:02,741
that I get when I play.

913
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:04,871
The "nothing else matters" feeling.

914
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:07,517
I think--

915
00:39:07,517 --> 00:39:09,712
I think you need that right now.

916
00:39:10,846 --> 00:39:12,512
I don't wanna see you give up...

917
00:39:12,546 --> 00:39:14,213
because of what we had between us.

918
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:15,870
Whatever--
whatever it was.

919
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,710
All right, let's go!

920
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:42,911
See? I told you.

921
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:44,170
They're still doing
the individual competition.

922
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:45,812
They always do
the individual first.

923
00:39:48,245 --> 00:39:49,970
You just wanna be the coach of everything.

924
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:51,711
No, you just like to rush us
out of the house all the time.

925
00:39:51,747 --> 00:39:52,972
Where's Julie?

926
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,971
All right, y'all remember.
It's N.H.F.S. rules.

927
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,370
That means no jewelry whatsoever.

928
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:58,970
No belly rings, no tongue rings,

929
00:39:59,015 --> 00:40:00,073
anything like that.

930
00:40:00,116 --> 00:40:01,243
If you have scorpion double downs,

931
00:40:01,277 --> 00:40:02,510
if you have scale double downs,

932
00:40:02,546 --> 00:40:04,273
make sure that you have spotters.

933
00:40:05,546 --> 00:40:07,342
One foot must be on the competition mat

934
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:09,311
at all times.

935
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:10,573
Also, as soon as the music begins,

936
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:11,843
the scoring process starts.

937
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,141
You got it?

938
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,740
Good luck, y'all. You're gonna do great.

939
00:40:21,847 --> 00:40:23,710
Hey...

940
00:40:23,745 --> 00:40:25,142
You all right?

941
00:40:25,178 --> 00:40:26,273
Yeah.

942
00:40:26,316 --> 00:40:27,811
Yeah, I'm cool.

943
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,211
Just a little nosebleed, that's all.

944
00:40:29,248 --> 00:40:31,742
"Little," hell.

945
00:40:34,547 --> 00:40:36,241
I'll see you out there.

946
00:40:37,946 --> 00:40:39,843
You liked every second of it.

947
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:41,273
How are you?
Hey, Coach.

948
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:42,273
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

949
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,612
Hey, man, how you doing?

950
00:40:43,648 --> 00:40:45,970
I wish you could have been
out there on the golf course.

951
00:40:46,016 --> 00:40:48,070
Good one. I wish I shot 64.

952
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:51,013
Hey.

953
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:02,713
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

954
00:41:02,746 --> 00:41:04,110
- Excuse me. Kick butt.

955
00:41:04,145 --> 00:41:05,340
Give me extra pins.

956
00:41:05,378 --> 00:41:06,771
I don't want any bows flying on the...

957
00:41:06,817 --> 00:41:07,870
I'm here.

958
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:09,110
- Hello.
- Hi.

959
00:41:09,146 --> 00:41:10,372
A little late, aren't you?

960
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:11,713
- Yeah, sorry.
- Name.

961
00:41:11,748 --> 00:41:12,742
Lyla Garrity.

962
00:41:12,777 --> 00:41:14,272
Ohh.

963
00:41:14,317 --> 00:41:15,911
Yeah, the whore with the web site.

964
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:17,870
Well, I thought

965
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:19,043
I heard you weren't going on.

966
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:20,170
Well, you heard wrong.

967
00:41:20,217 --> 00:41:21,773
Sign me in.

968
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:25,943
You heard the girl.

969
00:41:25,975 --> 00:41:28,370
Brittany, Lyla's flying.

970
00:41:28,415 --> 00:41:31,143
"Go, Panthers" on three.

971
00:41:31,176 --> 00:41:32,442
One, two, three...

972
00:41:32,478 --> 00:41:33,940
Go, Panthers!

973
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:35,741
All right, you guys, line up.

974
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:37,043
Let's do this.
