1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:01,780
Can I just say that
you're choosing to date

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:02,598
a football player?

3
00:00:02,608 --> 00:00:04,582
He doesn't buy
into the whole jock thing.

4
00:00:04,746 --> 00:00:05,933
People change.

5
00:00:05,934 --> 00:00:07,447
Especially when they're
on the team.

6
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:09,922
Look, it's just some
pick-me-ups I've been taking.

7
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:11,406
What are you doing
to my son?

8
00:00:11,407 --> 00:00:12,757
I don't know
what's going on here.

9
00:00:12,758 --> 00:00:13,616
This!

10
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:16,070
Smash is not gonna be
playing the game Friday night.

11
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:17,589
What?

12
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,510
Am I off the team?

13
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:20,188
I should have reported this.

14
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,771
You're gonna get yourself clean.

15
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:23,461
Dad's down
in Corpus Christi.

16
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:24,720
He's working on a driving range.

17
00:00:24,747 --> 00:00:26,130
Couple of postcards
every year

18
00:00:26,138 --> 00:00:27,610
and he gets off scot-free!

19
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:29,002
I'm the one paying the bills
around here,

20
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:30,951
going out there and watching
your damn football games.

21
00:00:30,956 --> 00:00:31,732
What's this?

22
00:00:31,736 --> 00:00:32,792
You've been served.

23
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:33,691
Served by who?

24
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:35,031
Jason Street's family.

25
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:37,182
It's killing me to have
to do this to coach.

26
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,912
The lawyers, my parents,
maybe they're right.

27
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:41,210
Maybe if somebody teaches me
how to tackle somebody,

28
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:42,272
I'm not in a chair.

29
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:44,250
Why'd you set Lyla up
on a date with Ty Johnston?

30
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:45,842
I don't want Lyla to be

31
00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:47,920
a caregiver her whole life, son.

32
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:49,480
These Buddy Garritys of this world,

33
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:51,143
they're a cancer to you and me.

34
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:52,160
Lyla Garrity...

35
00:00:53,168 --> 00:00:54,370
will you marry me?

36
00:00:57,998 --> 00:00:59,133
So

37
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:00,882
there's two cones
on either side of the goal.

38
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:02,391
There's two goals, one
on either side of the court.

39
00:01:02,865 --> 00:01:04,052
You play on a basketball court.

40
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:06,513
And the goal is
to get this ball--

41
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,651
Y'all, watch those windows.

42
00:01:07,677 --> 00:01:08,970
And you wheel yourself through
the finish--

43
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:09,630
That's okay.

44
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,621
You wheel yourself through the goal line
and that's how you score.

45
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:13,962
The position I really wanted

46
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:16,190
- is called the "picker."
- It's like the quarterback, right?

47
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:17,133
Right, right.

48
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:18,553
He kinda controls the flow
of the game

49
00:01:18,587 --> 00:01:20,661
and he leads the breaks
and everything.

50
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:22,130
You gotta be really fast.

51
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:23,560
It's a really, really
hard position but

52
00:01:23,678 --> 00:01:25,263
I think-- I think
I'm good enough for it.

53
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:27,993
So is this what I see them
playing at the YMCA sometimes?

54
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:30,760
Oh, no, ma'am,
that's wheelchair basketball.

55
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:32,800
Oh.There's a huge difference.

56
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:34,363
Oh, yeah. Huge.

57
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:38,442
Well, there is
a big difference, Mr. Garrity.

58
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:40,642
The guys who play quad rugby,
they're world-class athletes.

59
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:42,373
Three of them won medals last
year at the world championship.

60
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:43,613
- Did they?
- Yeah.

61
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:46,461
I know, it's great.
It's a great hobby.

62
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:48,513
Come on, Dad, it's not a hobby.

63
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:50,013
You can't make a living from it,
honey, so

64
00:01:50,097 --> 00:01:51,183
it must be a hobby.

65
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:54,950
You guys, let's come on in
and eat, all right?

66
00:01:57,476 --> 00:01:58,672
You know what, Mr. Garrity?

67
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:00,592
What exactly do you have
against quad rugby again?

68
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:01,433
Nothing.

69
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,771
Yes, you do 'cause
every time I come over here,

70
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:04,280
- you're always making fun of it.
-Sweetie.

71
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,593
All  I'm saying is it's not
a way to make a living.

72
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:09,410
So what are you
gonna live off of, huh?

73
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:12,390
- Lawsuit?
- Buddy, enough, okay?

74
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:14,533
Oh, is that what this is about, Mr. Garrity?
You still pissed off about the lawsuits?

75
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:15,811
- Yes, I am.
- What, are you a little kid?

76
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:16,500
Get over it!

77
00:02:16,558 --> 00:02:18,033
Hey, let me tell
you something, son.

78
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:20,421
You're suing my team.
You're suing my coach.

79
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:22,561
- How do you expect me to feel?
- It's your team?

80
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:24,302
How about a little compassion,
Mr. Garrity?

81
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:26,063
I mean, I am paralyzed now.

82
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:27,542
- Jason.
- All right, play the game.

83
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:28,883
- Ply the gasme.
- I don't care. Play the game.

84
00:02:28,907 --> 00:02:30,193
I will play the game,
Mr. Garrity.

85
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:31,130
- I will, I will.
- Do it.

86
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:32,181
And when I make
the national team

87
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:33,383
and I start touring
all over the world,

88
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:34,421
I'll take your daughter
with me.

89
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:35,560
How 'bout that?

90
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:37,280
'Cause we're getting married.

91
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:40,090
Excuse me?

92
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:42,650
- That's right.
- Married?

93
00:02:42,765 --> 00:02:44,251
Yeah, we picked out a ring
this morning, didn't we?

94
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,302
Okay.

95
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:55,270
Daddy, please.

96
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:02,441
What are you doing?

97
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:03,830
What am I doing?
He's pushing me.

98
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:05,121
- Jason.
- Hey.

99
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:07,372
I'm not doing
anything wrong here, Lyla!

100
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:09,443
Lyla!

101
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:14,000

105
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:57,890
Good evening, football fans!

106
00:03:57,896 --> 00:04:00,030
I'm Ralph Jarrett,
broadcasting live

107
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:01,300
from Applebee's

108
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:02,551
in Reiner Junction

109
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,563
for a special playoff edition

110
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,850
of Talkin' Panther Football.

111
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:11,723
You know, the brackets
have been set

112
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:15,081
and we know Dillon has drawn
the McNulty Mavericks

113
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:16,221
in the first round.

114
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:18,312
I'm going all the way
with him, baby.

115
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,871
The big question all over town
is Smash Williams

116
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:23,490
who got benched last week
and didn't play.

117
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:26,071
Is he gonna be able
to play this Friday night?

118
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:27,542
Let's get to the phone lines!

119
00:04:27,686 --> 00:04:29,472
So who had
the quesadilla burger?

120
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:30,290
I did.

121
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:31,981
Anyways, he got exactly
what he deserved.

122
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,060
Shut up, man.

123
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,270
I mean, do you even know
what happened?

124
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:35,200
Are you a big shot now?

125
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:37,651
Want to take us
to state by yourself?

126
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,282
The point is, we won last week
without him.

127
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:42,790
How did your meeting
with Mr. Connolly go?

128
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:45,333
Um, it actually went
really good.

129
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:46,652
- Yeah? 
- Um, well, I mean,

130
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:48,610
what I really want is
I want my own column,

131
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:51,652
you know, where I could
do reviews on movies and books

132
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,091
and concerts.

133
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:55,081
- That'd be cool.
- Julie Taylor's column on life.

134
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:57,233
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a big treat.

135
00:04:57,275 --> 00:05:00,460
I understand starting quarterback
Matt Saracen is in the house.

136
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:01,982
Maybe he'll come up
and join us.

137
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:03,633
Come on, Matt!

138
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:11,711
Sar-a-cen!
Sar-a-cen!

139
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:14,542
You  really didn't have
to do this.

140
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,183
- I could stay right here.
- No, go, go.

141
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:19,813
Sar-a-cen!
Sar-a-cen!

142
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:25,471
And then straight from the radio,

143
00:05:25,477 --> 00:05:27,320
Matt Saracen here.
Matt's sitting down here

144
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:29,059
talking about football.

145
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,480
I, uh--

146
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,938
Look, I'm so sorry.
I didn't think--

147
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,160
I mean, that guy can talk.

148
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,921
Seriously.
He doesn't stop talking.

149
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,942
No, it's cool.
You're the big star now, right?

150
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:43,163
No, I'm not a big star.
I didn't know that--

151
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,112
I'm sorry.

152
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:45,532
I thought it would just be, like, hi,

153
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,422
and then I came back,
and you were--

154
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:49,691
Matt, they wouldn't even
let me pay for dinner.

155
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:52,730
Tonight is
your night, my friend!

156
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:54,653
Saracen.
You're coming with.

157
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:55,402
No, I'm not.

158
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:56,703
- Let's go!
- I'm with Julie right now.

159
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:01,660
- Uh, no no no no--
- Seriously. Get in.

160
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,790
- Wait, where are you taking him?
- Duty calls!

161
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:04,720
Keep him in there.

162
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:06,100
- Uh--
- I'm-I'm sorry, but--

163
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:07,532
You can't just leave me here.

164
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:08,752
Sorry, it's a football thing.

165
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:10,131
- Yeah, but I need a ride home.
- Let's go!

166
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:13,740
They're making me do this.
I don't wanna--

167
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:16,821
Let's go!

168
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:19,723
- Whoo!
- Football.

169
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:22,410
You know, he's not coming back,
if that's what you're thinking.

170
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:25,903
Want a ride?

171
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:28,671
Uh, no thank you.

172
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:30,952
Um,
I'll just call my mom.

173
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:32,262
Okay.

174
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:37,350
Wait!

175
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:40,711
Are you sure you don't mind?

176
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:41,670
Yeah.

177
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:42,821
It's no problem.

178
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:45,260
I just gotta
pick my sister up first.

179
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:46,583
Okay, well, where's she at?

180
00:06:47,195 --> 00:06:47,981
Working.

181
00:06:48,977 --> 00:06:49,801
Strip club.

182
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:11,401
Two ways to fold a towel:

183
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:13,081
my way and the wrong way.
Let's do it right.

184
00:07:17,197 --> 00:07:18,523
Yes, sir.

185
00:07:24,587 --> 00:07:25,853
Game plan for Friday.

186
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:26,941
I want ten of 'em.

187
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:29,340
Binders and notebooks
over by the copier.

188
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:32,580
Right now?

189
00:07:33,508 --> 00:07:34,502
Well, gee, yeah, Smash,

190
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:35,972
if it wouldn't be too much
of an inconvenience,

191
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:37,253
I'd appreciate it. 

192
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:39,102
Hey, let me tell you something.

193
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:40,620
You think I'd rather be
here right now

194
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,851
with you at the crack of dawn

195
00:07:41,855 --> 00:07:43,651
than be home with my family
cooking breakfast?

196
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:44,391
- Coach, I'm sorry.
- Huh?

197
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,950
- I'm sorry.
- You thinkin' about that?

198
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,011
Did you bring those test
results from the clinic?

199
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:49,740
- Yes, sir.
- Lemme see 'em.

200
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:55,573
-  Coach, I didn't mean--
- You didn't mean what?

201
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:57,873
You didn't mean to risk my
reputation and my career?

202
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,901
Is that what
you were gonna say?

203
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:01,201
I got the chairman of the
district executive committee.

204
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:02,011
You know what he's doing?

205
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:03,833
He's calling me at home.

206
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:05,872
So you're not the only one

207
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:08,133
with your ass
on the line, Smash.

208
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:10,881
Yes, sir.

209
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:13,932
That's good!
Congratulations.

210
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:22,840
Sir, I still don't see
what the big deal is.

211
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:24,522
Why can't I just pay
the ticket and go?

212
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,691
Well, the problem's not so much
the speeding ticket.

213
00:08:26,695 --> 00:08:28,533
It's your failure to appear.

214
00:08:28,745 --> 00:08:29,752
Yes, sir.

215
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:31,611
You see,
I had an away game that day,

216
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:32,962
so I completely forgot--

217
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,210
Look, how about this:

218
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:35,960
you pay the fine,
you promise me you're not gonna

219
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,833
speed out there,
and I'll drop the charges.

220
00:08:37,927 --> 00:08:39,722
If it's okay
with your folks.

221
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:43,481
Is it okay
if my brother signs for me?

222
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:45,162
Is he your legal guardian?

223
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:47,460
- Billy!
- What?

224
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:48,990
Are you his legal guardian?

225
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:50,950
Uh, no, technically
I'm not, but--

226
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,020
Look, you're a minor.
It has to be a parent

227
00:08:53,026 --> 00:08:54,161
or a legal guardian.

228
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,121
Otherwise, I have
to take your license.

229
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,373
This is no joke, son.

230
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,570
Just get that signed.

231
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:00,380
All right, Your Honor.

232
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:02,151
Um, I'll just get my father
to sign it.

233
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:03,621
Just get it signed
and bring it back.

234
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:06,001
So last night
was the first time

235
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,572
I've ever stepped foot
in a strip club.

236
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:09,031
You don't say.

237
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:13,230
I know we were there
for, like, five minutes, but

238
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:16,151
does your sister ever get,
like, freaked out?

239
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,941
I mean, some of those guys
were completely creepy.

240
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,101
Yeah, well,

241
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,093
she's a big girl.

242
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:22,343
Plus, those guys
are pretty harmless.

243
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,691
Sad and pathetic,

244
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:24,672
but harmless.

245
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:28,723
Guess who her
biggest customer is?

246
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:30,273
Who?

247
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,791
Buddy Garrity.

248
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:36,761
Gross!

249
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:38,562
Okay.

250
00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:42,121
No, it's up there.

251
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:45,483
That color
looks good on you.

252
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:47,200
You  should get it.

253
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:49,200
I don't know.

254
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,003
I don't really
have the money for it.

255
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,102
What are you doing?

256
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:09,910
Tim, just let me sign
the stupid paper, man.

257
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:11,140
No, Billy.

258
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,342
I can't risk it.
It's my license.

259
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:15,383
What is this?

260
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:17,312
Some sort of work out my stuff
with dad thing?

261
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:19,380
What are you talking about?

262
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:20,573
Hey, Tim.

263
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:24,112
We haven't even seen
the guy in two years, man.

264
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:25,712
We don't even know
if he still lives here.

265
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,221
I'm sure
it'll be fine, Billy.

266
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:30,903
All right, I'm good.

267
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:31,831
Hey.

268
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:32,860
Come here.

269
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:35,673
Do not believe a word that
that man says, okay?

270
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:37,381
Because he is a total liar.

271
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:39,342
And do not get drunk
with him

272
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:41,350
because he is a mean son
of a bitch when he's loaded.

273
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:44,332
Billy, it's a signature.

274
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,783
That's all I'm gettin'.

275
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:49,323
All right.All right.
You got money?

276
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:50,473
Yeah, I got money.

277
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:51,793
Here. Uh, take that.

278
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:55,201
Whatever you do, do not,

279
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:57,241
under any circumstances,

280
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:58,542
give that money to him.

281
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,432
I understand, Billy.

282
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,831
All right.

283
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:03,462
All right. Thank you.

284
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:07,850
Hey!

285
00:11:08,557 --> 00:11:09,771
See ya soon!

286
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:11,661
Yeah.

287
00:11:17,237 --> 00:11:20,812
No, you are not going
to a concert on a weeknight.

288
00:11:20,855 --> 00:11:22,182
But it's not just any concert.

289
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:24,030
I mean, it's the Old 97s
and they're awesome.

290
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:26,800
Well, if they're so awesome,
why don't they get a gig on a weekend?

291
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:28,020
What do I have
to do to make this work?

292
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:29,651
I will get on the floor
and start groveling.

293
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:31,092
Honey,
what about your homework?

294
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:32,662
I'll get it done...

295
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:34,663
before I leave
and you can check it

296
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:36,403
and I'll stay in
on Saturday.

297
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,833
And you and me and dad,

298
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:39,240
we can have, like,
a family night.

299
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:40,650
Oh, honey, don't grovel.

300
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,960
It's not becoming.

301
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:44,883
Please?

302
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:48,680
All right.

303
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:49,921
You have to be in by 11:00,

304
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:51,312
not one second later.

305
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:51,862
Yes, ma'am.

306
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:54,010
And don't tell your father.
Let me break it to your father.

307
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:54,901
All you!

308
00:11:54,928 --> 00:11:56,003
Hey, where's your coat?

309
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,133
Put your coat on!

310
00:11:57,478 --> 00:11:58,750
Hurry up.

311
00:11:59,388 --> 00:12:01,830
And make sure the door locks
when you close it!

312
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:04,140
Hurry up!

313
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:31,841
Throwed his sorry ass out
six months ago, Sugar.

314
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:34,303
Well, do you know
where I can find him, ma'am?

315
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:37,180
Well, he used to hustle golf
down at Jackson Crest.

316
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:40,691
It's a little piece of crap muni
somewhere out in the boonies.

317
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,331
All right.
I'll try him there.

318
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:45,152
- Thank you.
- You bet.

319
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:50,892
Hey, if you see him,
I want you to do something for me.

320
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:52,800
I want you to tell him

321
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:55,300
that I want my
Conway Twitty back.

322
00:12:55,926 --> 00:12:58,372
They don't have him
at Target no more.

323
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:00,300
All right!

324
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:02,132
Knock her close, buddy.

325
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:04,683
No, knock her close.

326
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:08,343
Nice shot, that'll save you
a couple bucks.

327
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:11,191
Oh, well.
It's just money, right?

328
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:12,221
The bill is 60.

329
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:14,021
Thanks, gentlemen.
Enjoy your money.

330
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,340
Oh, I will.

331
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:16,593
Hit that driving range.

332
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,271
Good God in heaven.

333
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:28,320
Timmy?

334
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:34,280
Well come on!

335
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:36,503
Give your old man a hug!

336
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:39,581
Come here, boy.

337
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,642
I guess I'm in no position

338
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:48,770
to be offering up
any fatherly advice.

339
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,030
You know, given--

340
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,413
given the circumstances. 

341
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:56,072
You just want me
to sign right here?

342
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:57,552
Yeah.

343
00:13:58,107 --> 00:13:59,090
Thanks.

344
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:02,892
All right.

345
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:05,453
Thanks.

346
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:07,253
So how you doing?

347
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:08,750
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

348
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:09,710
-  Really?
- Yeah.

349
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,183
How about you?

350
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:12,522
Well, I'm good.

351
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:14,593
Real good.

352
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:18,683
Yeah, I'm on--I'm on
the wagon now.

353
00:14:18,706 --> 00:14:20,490
You know, I've been sober, uh,

354
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:22,013
six weeks next Tuesday.

355
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:22,951
Nice.

356
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:25,282
Otherwise, I'd be buying
you a beer.

357
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:27,481
Well, that's all right.

358
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:29,641
I gotta drive anyways, so--

359
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:31,070
Oh. Well--

360
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:38,761
Yeah.

361
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:41,461
- Anyways, I sh--
- Can you hang out for a while?

362
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:45,311
Yeah.

363
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:48,880
Yeah, I could--

364
00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:50,261
I could stay for a bit.

365
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:53,002
Well, I got $200 burning
a hole in my pocket

366
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:55,211
from Manny, Moe, and Jack out there.
Are you hungry at all?

367
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:56,902
I could eat.

368
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:57,843
Good.

369
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:00,231
Okay, okay.

370
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:02,410
I'm sorry.

371
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:05,322
I didn't want it
to happen like that.

372
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:06,173
- I really didn't.
- It's okay.

373
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:06,792
I swear.

374
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:08,853
I know.
It's kinda my fault too.

375
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:11,403
I don't know why I felt like
I had to hide it from them.

376
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,583
I know you're gonna think this is

377
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:20,261
a total girl thing, and I'm crazy, but---

378
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,462
but I just--
I've always had this vision,

379
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:25,523
you know, of my wedding,

380
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,753
and I'd be 25.

381
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:30,281
There'd be this huge reception

382
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:31,552
and dancing and toasts.

383
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:33,482
You don't know if you can do
all that with me now.

384
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,250
No, Jason.

385
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:36,383
If you're gonna be honest,
just--

386
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:38,273
No, that has nothing to do with

387
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:40,823
it being you. It's just

388
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:43,263
I haven't even
applied to a college yet.

389
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:45,712
And you haven't even said
whether or not you're--

390
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:47,252
Oh, you think I'm not going
to college now?

391
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:48,350
I don't know.

392
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:51,543
I mean, I assume you are,

393
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,873
but all you talk about is--

394
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:55,051
Lyla, I lost my legs, not my brain.

395
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:56,990
Okay, I'm gonna go to school.

396
00:15:57,177 --> 00:15:58,423
And I'm gonna get a job.

397
00:15:58,447 --> 00:16:00,500
And we'll have friends.
We'll have a big house

398
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,122
and a picket fence
and a couple of puppies

399
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:03,720
and that whole thing
you dream about.

400
00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:04,412
No, Jason!

401
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:05,531
Getting married's
not gonna change that.

402
00:16:05,537 --> 00:16:07,121
I have a life too.

403
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:08,540
- I know.
- No,

404
00:16:08,546 --> 00:16:11,163
sometimes I don't think
you care about that anymore.

405
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:12,373
Or you think it's lame.

406
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:13,922
And it scares me, Jason.

407
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:15,243
- No, that's not it at all.
- I just think that

408
00:16:15,246 --> 00:16:17,313
we're too young right now
and we're rushing into this.

409
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:18,912
And I don't want to make a mistake.

410
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:24,492
Message received, Lyla.

411
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:25,641
Loud and clear.

412
00:16:33,097 --> 00:16:34,580
Can you please
get my chair for me?

413
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:36,201
Yeah.

414
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,131
Blue, 20, hut!

415
00:16:42,157 --> 00:16:43,582
You gotta get
up on him, Smash!

416
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,773
Get out of the sack!
Come on, Smash! Pick it up!

417
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:47,812
What the hell
are you walking for?

418
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:49,341
God.

419
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:50,090
Dang.

420
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:51,142
- Coach--
- Let's go.

421
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:54,530
Not as much fun when
you're blocking, is it, huh?

422
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:55,982
Just doing my job, man.

423
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:56,841
Just doing my job.

424
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:58,452
Smash, you better get
your head out front!

425
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,871
- You gotta drive his ass!
- Yes, sir.

426
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:02,212
Well, I can see teaching him
a lesson, coach, but--

427
00:17:02,217 --> 00:17:03,092
Let's go!

428
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:05,053
It's not gonna do us much good
Friday night if he's hurt.

429
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,030
Who said he was gonna play
Friday night? Let's go!

430
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:09,012
Come on, Eric,
you gotta be kidding me.

431
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:11,462
Baxter can't hold
Smash's jock.

432
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:13,921
Let's go!

433
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:15,502
- Hey, you're the coach.
- Run the ball!

434
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:16,432
It's your team.

435
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:18,021
God, I'm tired of this!

436
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:19,812
But you know tomorrow night
will be good.

437
00:17:19,815 --> 00:17:20,782
That's gonna be
a lot of fun.

438
00:17:20,785 --> 00:17:21,452
You know what, Buddy,

439
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,990
I'm trying to win
a play-off game here.

440
00:17:22,996 --> 00:17:24,960
I don't have time
to talk about a damn TV show.

441
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:26,230
It's tradition.

442
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:28,321
It's simple.
All you gotta do is go up there

443
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,692
and smile pretty, talk about
football for half an hour.

444
00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:32,272
It'll be easy.
You'll love it.

445
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:33,632
It's all about football.

446
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:35,331
Let's go!
Hustle up now!

447
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:38,060
- Attaboy!
- How's he gonna get outside--

448
00:17:38,117 --> 00:17:41,083
And besides, remember, you get a nice
little appearance fee for doing it.

449
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:45,491
Wait a sec!
Hold up, hold up!

450
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:48,781
Look, I'm really sorry.
I know you wanted to go to the concert

451
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:51,452
Yeah, that's kinda the point,
saying you invited me.

452
00:17:51,526 --> 00:17:53,492
- Right--
- But, you know, no biggie.

453
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:56,453
I just pretty much sold my soul
to my mother for permission.

454
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,311
It's just, you know,

455
00:17:57,316 --> 00:17:58,841
your dad asked me,

456
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:01,381
and well, I've never been
on TV before.

457
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:07,573
Okay, so if my dad
wasn't involved,

458
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:10,141
are you excited?

459
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:12,041
Yeah, a little bit.

460
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,111
Then you should go.

461
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:14,352
- You rea--
- But!

462
00:18:14,498 --> 00:18:15,632
You have to remember
this moment

463
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,771
when I officially became
the coolest

464
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:20,302
and most understanding girl
in the world.

465
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:22,530
Okay, I will.
I'll keep that in mind.

466
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:24,572
Are you mad?

467
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:26,150
A little,
but I'll get over it.

468
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:27,120
Good...

469
00:18:27,216 --> 00:18:28,503
because

470
00:18:28,838 --> 00:18:32,183
I also need you to watch
my grandma while I do it?

471
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:35,412
Please?

472
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:38,010
Sure. Why not?

473
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:41,292
See, you are the coolest, most
understanding girlfriend in the world.

474
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:42,782
Girlfriend?

475
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:44,223
All right, girl.

476
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:45,393
'Cause I'm hoping--

477
00:18:45,397 --> 00:18:46,612
- Please?
- No.

478
00:18:46,615 --> 00:18:48,331
- Do not "no"--
- No!

479
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:52,130
Yeah, baby, that's
what I'm talking about!

480
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:53,820
- Fish in a barrel!
- Nice shot.

481
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:55,011
Not too shabby.

482
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:56,533
Hey, here she is.

483
00:18:56,578 --> 00:18:57,532
Hanna Banana.

484
00:18:57,558 --> 00:18:59,220
- Come here.
- Oh, hey, Walt.

485
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,530
This is my boy Tim.

486
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:03,272
Take care of him.
Whatever he wants.

487
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:04,393
All right,
I'll be back in a minute.

488
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:05,910
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you. Thank you.

489
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:07,983
Oh, my God,

490
00:19:08,076 --> 00:19:10,222
so you're the son, huh?

491
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:11,581
Nice to meet you.

492
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,313
You know, he talks
about you all the time.

493
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:16,313
Really?

494
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:17,133
Oh, yeah.

495
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:19,803
Every Saturday when he comes
in here for league,

496
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:21,630
we get the whole update,

497
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:22,783
who you played

498
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:23,861
the score,

499
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:25,552
how many touchdowns you made.

500
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:27,761
Oh, he is so proud.

501
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:29,072
And congratulations

502
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:30,681
for making it
to the playoffs by the way.

503
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:32,061
- Check it out.
- Check it out.

504
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:35,310
- Oh, baby!
- My God.

505
00:19:35,728 --> 00:19:36,921
A new ball.

506
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:39,593
He's only waited
on that for a month.

507
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:41,180
This is a weapon.

508
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:42,983
You're in serious trouble,
my friend.

509
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:44,373
Don't go hurting yourself.

510
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:46,303
No, I won't.
Thank you.

511
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:47,432
Okay, honey.

512
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:49,100
Bye, sweetie.

513
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:50,243
I'll see ya later.

514
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,380
I appreciate it.

515
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:54,803
Hey, uh,

516
00:19:54,808 --> 00:19:56,481
if we're still gonna grab
that bite to eat later,

517
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,603
maybe it's best I stay
at your place tonight.

518
00:19:58,788 --> 00:19:59,711
What do you think?

519
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:02,133
Yeah, man!

520
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:03,601
Bring it on.

521
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:05,902
I got a couch with your name
written all over it.

522
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:06,832
All right.

523
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:16,933
Hey!

524
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:23,270
All right, this should be
the screen pass to Riggins

525
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:24,712
when we finally score here.

526
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,972
- It's the play after this.
- Hang on a second.

527
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:29,173
No, Coach--
If you hit forward--

528
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:30,831
Hang on a second.
I know what I'm doing.

529
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,073
I smell Emmy.

530
00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:33,892
Yeah, well, I'm gonna have

531
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:36,161
to renegotiate
that appearance fee.

532
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:39,350
- If you just hit it once--
- Stop!

533
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:43,320
Hey, there's something wrong
with the clicker.

534
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:45,690
There's something wrong
with the clicker!

535
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,080
- We'll--we'll work--
- Ow.

536
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,070
Okay...

537
00:20:48,078 --> 00:20:50,091
Let's not do
the game film right now.

538
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:51,832
Obviously we have a problem
with the clicker.

539
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:53,321
Let's do the interview.

540
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:54,913
Uh, Coach, just relax,

541
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:56,220
and have a conversation.

542
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:58,273
What would you like us
to have a conversation about?

543
00:20:59,138 --> 00:20:59,881
'Bout football.

544
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:01,061
Oh, that's great.

545
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:02,212
Okay, let's do that.

546
00:21:02,256 --> 00:21:03,381
Anything specific?

547
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:08,550
Matt, why don't you ask him,
uh, some questions?

548
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:09,992
Good? Yeah.

549
00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:10,990
That's a good idea.

550
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:12,681
Okay. When you're ready.

551
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:13,803
Well, okay, um...

552
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:15,880
I think what
everyone wants to know

553
00:21:16,256 --> 00:21:17,303
is, um,

554
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:19,600
is Smash gonna play on Friday?

555
00:21:21,678 --> 00:21:22,700
What the hell kind
of question is that?

556
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:24,312
You're supposed to be helping
me out here, Saracen.

557
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:25,560
- Well, I just thought--
- Don't be goofy.

558
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:26,802
Just ask a normal question.

559
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:27,863
Let's get this over with

560
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:28,953
That's what
everybody's been asking.

561
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:29,883
Ask him about the tight end.

562
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:32,492
You find everything
in there, honey?

563
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:33,200
Uh, yeah.

564
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:34,401
Everything's good.

565
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,680
Uh, here's your sandwich.

566
00:21:37,218 --> 00:21:38,531
Mm. Thank you.

567
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:39,753
Good.

568
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:41,422
I got it.

569
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:44,360
Is it okay?

570
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,401
Um...
I invited a friend over.

571
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:48,821
I guess so.

572
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:50,762
I like company all right.

573
00:21:51,427 --> 00:21:53,103
All right, that's
the end of it, huh?

574
00:21:53,516 --> 00:21:54,591
That's all the other.

575
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:57,701
That's all
the other we got.

576
00:21:57,758 --> 00:21:59,292
I mean, that's one
of the reasons I swore

577
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:00,640
I'd never date
a football player.

578
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,622
Oh, honey, Matt's
not really a football player.

579
00:22:02,877 --> 00:22:03,861
No offense.

580
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:05,461
Oh, that's all right.

581
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:08,921
All right, but now that
he's acting like one

582
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:10,510
here's what
you gotta do.

583
00:22:10,555 --> 00:22:12,692
Number one rule
in dating a Dillon Panther,

584
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:14,920
always let him know
you have options.

585
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,490
But I do have options.

586
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,003
I'm gonna join
the school paper.

587
00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:22,092
I mean, like,
the basketball team.

588
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:23,312
They hate that.

589
00:22:23,787 --> 00:22:25,641
But I don't know anybody
on the basketball team.

590
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:26,761
Isn't that just kinda stupid?

591
00:22:26,766 --> 00:22:28,460
Okay, but see,
he doesn't have to know that.

592
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:30,741
I'm telling you, he's gonna
have these rally girls

593
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,493
fawning all over him
until Spring, okay?

594
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:33,892
You gotta elevate your game.

595
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:36,810
Look, Eric,

596
00:22:37,198 --> 00:22:39,451
I have always loved Jason
like my son.

597
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,570
I still do.

598
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:43,051
But this is my daughter
we're talking about.

599
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:44,552
And the bottom line is

600
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:46,032
Jason's a quadriplegic.

601
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:47,830
Now, I know it's not PC
to say that,

602
00:22:47,836 --> 00:22:49,571
but I have to think
about my daughter.

603
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:52,441
She's my responsibility.
I gotta think about her life.

604
00:22:52,448 --> 00:22:54,673
I'll tell you something.
Jason Street's a good kid.

605
00:22:54,677 --> 00:22:56,981
He's gonna succeed
no matter what he does.

606
00:22:57,277 --> 00:22:59,471
Just give him some time.
The last thing you wanna do

607
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:00,521
is pressure them.

608
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:02,242
That's gonna come around
and bite you in the ass

609
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,091
- if you do that.
- Yeah.

610
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:04,612
- They're smart kids. They'll deal with it.
- Yeah.

611
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,182
I thought they were smart.

612
00:23:06,247 --> 00:23:08,223
I thought that till they tell me
they're getting married.

613
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:09,152
They're just in high school.

614
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:12,270
I mean, maybe someday in the
future if things work out.

615
00:23:12,328 --> 00:23:14,411
So please just talk to Jason.

616
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:15,723
- I'll do that.
- He respects you.

617
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:16,933
- Thanks.
- I'll do that.

618
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,511
If someone would talk
to his parents,

619
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,191
maybe I wouldn't be
getting sued right now.

620
00:23:20,216 --> 00:23:22,111
Yeah, I wish I could talk
to them for you. Hey!

621
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:24,292
That was a great job in there.

622
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:28,151
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

623
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:35,080
Child, where you been?

624
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:37,012
It's almost time for Leno!

625
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:39,463
Boy!

626
00:23:40,717 --> 00:23:42,390
You been runnin'
this whole time?

627
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:43,242
Mostly.

628
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:45,191
I stopped once or twice.

629
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:46,860
Oh, I think you need
to slow down.

630
00:23:47,237 --> 00:23:49,272
- Don't even worry about it.
- Oh, I do worry about it.

631
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:50,551
That's my job.

632
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:51,972
That's your job?

633
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:54,752
Well, I'm doing
my job too, Mama.

634
00:23:55,328 --> 00:23:56,730
All right, I'm so tired

635
00:23:56,998 --> 00:23:58,342
I can barely finish my sets

636
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:00,180
without feeling
like I'ma fall over and die.

637
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:01,291
I know.
It's that poison.

638
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:03,822
Your body just needs time
to adjust.

639
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:05,062
Mama, I don't have any time!

640
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:07,212
You know what it's like
over there?

641
00:24:07,355 --> 00:24:08,732
It's like blood in the water!

642
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:10,772
I mean, I got Baxter trying

643
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:11,710
to steal my job!

644
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:13,722
And Coach watching me
like a hawk!

645
00:24:14,098 --> 00:24:16,540
So, no, no!
I'm not gonna slow down!

646
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:18,082
At least not right now!

647
00:24:18,148 --> 00:24:19,811
I just worry about you.

648
00:24:19,986 --> 00:24:20,810
I know--

649
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,303
All Jason wanted
to do was slalom.

650
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,610
I bet I was in that boat
with him for three hours

651
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:34,453
trying to get him up.

652
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:36,161
Going round and round.
You remember?

653
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:36,972
Yeah.

654
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:38,563
I remember.

655
00:24:39,255 --> 00:24:40,820
He was pretty pissed that day.

656
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:45,873
I don't think J's gonna be doing

657
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:47,580
too much more skiing anymore
though.

658
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:49,152
It's a damn shame.

659
00:24:49,617 --> 00:24:50,880
He's good people, that kid.

660
00:24:51,437 --> 00:24:52,073
Yep.

661
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:54,362
How's Billy doing?

662
00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:56,803
Good.
He actually says

663
00:24:57,467 --> 00:24:58,480
to say hi.

664
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:01,041
Did he really?

665
00:25:02,427 --> 00:25:04,011
No. Not at all really.

666
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:10,711
You know, Billy's all right.

667
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:14,481
I know he hates me.
I don't blame him.

668
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:16,892
You were

669
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:19,922
too young,

670
00:25:19,927 --> 00:25:21,052
but he saw some things
that...

671
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,742
I'm not too proud of.

672
00:25:25,765 --> 00:25:27,771
Dad, I was ten.
I wasn't blind.

673
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:42,240
Hey, did you
call your coach?

674
00:25:42,887 --> 00:25:43,873
Yeah, I did,

675
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:46,282
and he's pretty rattled
for missing two practices.

676
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:48,002
Yeah. I reckon.

677
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:52,222
It's worth it though.

678
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,193
So what do you think of Parcells?

679
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:01,940
Stick around
for another year or what?

680
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:03,983
Maybe get a ring.
Friggin' Cowboys?

681
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:06,132
No, no friggin' Cowboys.
I'm gonna start rooting for the Saints.

682
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:09,133
No kidding.

683
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:14,061
Next on number one tee will be

684
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,691
the Riggins twosome.

685
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:16,683
Riggins.

686
00:26:16,998 --> 00:26:18,203
$5 Nassau.

687
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:19,403
Automatic presses

688
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:20,343
when you're down two.

689
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:22,711
All right, well, that's not fair
'cause I got rentals.

690
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:24,160
Which is why I'm giving you
six strokes.

691
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:25,312
Now don't be a whiner.

692
00:26:25,905 --> 00:26:27,840
Well, let's up the ante then.

693
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:31,403
I win,

694
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:33,943
you come to Dillon
on Friday to watch me play.

695
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:34,940
Deal?

696
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:37,453
Uh-huh.
What if I win?

697
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,012
If you win,

698
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,232
which you won't...

699
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,013
I won't tell that gal Lydia
where you live.

700
00:26:48,137 --> 00:26:49,022
That's a good one.

701
00:26:49,685 --> 00:26:50,650
It's pretty good.

702
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:51,563
You're on.

703
00:26:51,636 --> 00:26:52,660
Let's see what you got.

704
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,491
Long and wrong.

705
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:57,813
Did you hit a car?

706
00:26:57,935 --> 00:26:58,721
Maybe.

707
00:27:00,605 --> 00:27:03,133
Nothing another swing can't
take care of, you know.

708
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:05,292
No, no, this ain't the LPGA,
you weenie.

709
00:27:05,298 --> 00:27:06,431
There's no mulligans.

710
00:27:07,305 --> 00:27:08,481
Come on.

711
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,663
All right.

712
00:27:11,985 --> 00:27:12,700
All right.

713
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:13,360
Hut!

714
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,061
Get there.
Get there.

715
00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:18,793
Man, these guys
are flat today.

716
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:20,300
Where's our energy?

717
00:27:20,577 --> 00:27:21,983
All right, come on,
let's hurry back!

718
00:27:21,986 --> 00:27:23,142
I'll tell you
what the problem is...

719
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:24,492
Come here!

720
00:27:24,506 --> 00:27:26,020
Somebody took the smash
out of the Smash.

721
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:26,793
Get over here.

722
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:28,280
What the hell's wrong
with you today?

723
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:29,651
What?

724
00:27:29,658 --> 00:27:30,500
What the hell's wrong
with you?

725
00:27:30,505 --> 00:27:31,672
Pro left 24 pitch.

726
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:32,642
I hit the right gap.

727
00:27:32,645 --> 00:27:33,852
Yeah, you did fine.

728
00:27:33,858 --> 00:27:34,513
Congratulations.

729
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:36,283
You know what though?
Fine doesn't win playoff games.

730
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,571
You're out here to win
or you go home, understood?

731
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:42,482
I was just doing what I'm told.

732
00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:43,772
You know what?
Don't talk back to me.

733
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:44,570
Talking back to me.

734
00:27:44,577 --> 00:27:45,553
- Think you're special?
- I'm sorry.

735
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:46,942
You can talk back to me now?
Know what I what you to do?

736
00:27:46,945 --> 00:27:48,080
I want you to go
down the end zone.

737
00:27:48,086 --> 00:27:49,610
You give me 20 suicides.

738
00:27:50,056 --> 00:27:50,733
Coach!

739
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:52,151
- 20--
- 20 suicides!

740
00:27:52,158 --> 00:27:53,843
In the end zone right now,
Brian!

741
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:58,641
Let's go!

742
00:27:58,648 --> 00:28:00,311
Dank, I want some fire out here!

743
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:01,681
Now let's do something!

744
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:02,581
Somebody in there.

745
00:28:02,588 --> 00:28:04,651
We're gonna run the slants
and nail on one.

746
00:28:04,657 --> 00:28:05,603
- Ready?
- Break.

747
00:28:05,696 --> 00:28:07,310
- Set!
- Sweetheart,

748
00:28:07,975 --> 00:28:09,080
not for nothing,

749
00:28:09,707 --> 00:28:11,421
but you are tied up

750
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:12,721
in knots right now.

751
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:15,671
You're wound up
like a drum.

752
00:28:15,756 --> 00:28:16,720
Wound up?

753
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:18,281
Yes, you are.

754
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:19,532
And you know what?

755
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:21,082
It's where Smash is gettin' it.
You know?

756
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:22,261
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

757
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,921
Well, I think, you know,
style filters down, babe.

758
00:28:25,748 --> 00:28:27,513
- "Style filters down"?
- Yeah.

759
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:28,590
What does that mean?

760
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:31,742
It means, I know
he made a mistake.

761
00:28:32,305 --> 00:28:33,862
I know it really
pissed you off.

762
00:28:33,907 --> 00:28:35,071
It really pissed me off too.

763
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:36,591
But you know what?
He's a boy...

764
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:38,542
He made a mistake.

765
00:28:38,636 --> 00:28:40,823
And he is trying so desperately
to get back

766
00:28:40,858 --> 00:28:42,033
in your good graces.

767
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:45,242
It seems to me
you're so hard on him

768
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:46,890
that he's losing his confidence.

769
00:28:47,168 --> 00:28:48,430
He's losing his passion.

770
00:28:48,535 --> 00:28:50,632
That's not gonna help you
one bit on Friday night.

771
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:51,522
Here, put those over there.

772
00:28:53,135 --> 00:28:54,390
I think you need
to talk to him.

773
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:55,670
I think you need
to turn that around.

774
00:29:00,178 --> 00:29:01,732
Can you put these
in the back pantry, please?

775
00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:10,271
There we go again.

776
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm actually getting kinda tired

777
00:29:13,005 --> 00:29:14,342
of hitting the green every time.

778
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:15,141
Not bad.

779
00:29:15,216 --> 00:29:16,590
A little quick
on your release though.

780
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:17,872
Thanks, Mr. Nicklaus.

781
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:20,403
I actually would take
a swing tip from you

782
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:22,151
if I wasn't kicking your ass
right now.

783
00:29:22,158 --> 00:29:23,051
You're only two up.

784
00:29:23,056 --> 00:29:24,781
There's plenty of golf
left to play.

785
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:25,692
Yeah, yeah.

786
00:29:27,616 --> 00:29:28,810
Let me ask you something.

787
00:29:29,757 --> 00:29:31,210
You feeling the pressure
right now?

788
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:33,561
Uh, not really.

789
00:29:34,258 --> 00:29:35,312
I've seen you putt.

790
00:29:42,206 --> 00:29:43,820
Ready, set, go!

791
00:29:58,138 --> 00:29:59,162
Hey,

792
00:29:59,815 --> 00:30:01,020
mind if I sit down?

793
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,621
Oh, no.
Go ahead.

794
00:30:11,055 --> 00:30:12,010
Yeah!

795
00:30:13,015 --> 00:30:13,853
Yeah!

796
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:16,823
We used
to have a kid like that

797
00:30:16,835 --> 00:30:18,060
in the neighborhood
when I was growing up.

798
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:19,861
I was that kid.

799
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:21,813
Yeah, I see
the resemblance.

800
00:30:23,457 --> 00:30:24,603
Yeah!

801
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:27,013
Yeah!

802
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:31,920
The reason I've been
so hard on you is--

803
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:34,460
'Cause I let you down.

804
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:40,440
Look, I appreciate you coming
down here, Coach.

805
00:30:40,947 --> 00:30:41,773
But

806
00:30:42,796 --> 00:30:44,053
I don't need
you to like me,

807
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:47,223
okay?
I've made peace with that.

808
00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:49,352
So I'ma just do
what I need to do on my own.

809
00:30:49,426 --> 00:30:51,010
No, that's not what
I want you to do.

810
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:52,911
That's not what football's
all about.

811
00:30:53,348 --> 00:30:55,391
You wanna fly solo,
you go run track.

812
00:30:57,538 --> 00:30:59,491
Sometimes we take this
so serious,

813
00:30:59,537 --> 00:31:01,510
we lose track of exactly why
it is we love

814
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:02,613
this damn game so much,

815
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:04,391
why it is we play this game.

816
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:10,182
I'm guilty of that.

817
00:31:16,495 --> 00:31:17,141
Hey.

818
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:20,001
Hey, are you
really Coach Taylor?

819
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:20,972
I am.

820
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:22,770
Well, you get ready for me.

821
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:26,090
I'll be there the first day
of practice in 2014.

822
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:27,320
Running back.

823
00:31:27,327 --> 00:31:28,660
Remember the name, Coach,

824
00:31:28,848 --> 00:31:29,820
Miles Shepard.

825
00:31:30,027 --> 00:31:31,071
Miles Shepard.

826
00:31:31,668 --> 00:31:32,882
- Shepard.
- Yup, that's my name.

827
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:34,480
All right,
I'll tell you what.

828
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,980
You give me a call when you get
out of pee-wee.

829
00:31:37,245 --> 00:31:38,303
I'll do that, sir.

830
00:31:38,755 --> 00:31:39,390
Nice.

831
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:42,470
Smash, you wanna play?

832
00:31:42,665 --> 00:31:44,192
I need a challenge, dog.

833
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:47,823
- Y'all wanna play some football?
- Yeah!

834
00:31:47,826 --> 00:31:48,431
Let's go!

835
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:49,351
- All right, let's do it.
- Yeah!

836
00:31:49,386 --> 00:31:51,103
Old Smash wants to get his

837
00:31:52,138 --> 00:31:53,540
head handed to him.

838
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:56,840
All right, who's on my team?
Who's on my team?

839
00:31:57,028 --> 00:31:58,052
Come here, girls.

840
00:32:01,146 --> 00:32:02,150
Hut-hut-hut!

841
00:32:02,195 --> 00:32:04,362
Go, go, go, go!

842
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:05,931
Bring her out,
bring her out, bring her out.

843
00:32:07,096 --> 00:32:08,042
Come on, Coach!

844
00:32:08,647 --> 00:32:09,713
I'm gonna give you a flag.

845
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:20,353
Yes!

846
00:32:20,635 --> 00:32:22,463
It's a ballgame
right there, boy!

847
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:23,951
Ah!

848
00:32:24,147 --> 00:32:25,582
That was
a good effort, partner.

849
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:28,800
You had me worried there
for a minute.

850
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:35,570
What?

851
00:32:36,757 --> 00:32:38,141
You thought I was gonna
let you win?

852
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,982
You know what, if you
didn't wanna come to the game,

853
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:41,243
you could have just said so.

854
00:32:41,647 --> 00:32:42,953
It would have been
a lot easier.

855
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,261
Listen to me, all right?

856
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:49,282
This bit--

857
00:32:49,838 --> 00:32:50,512
I mean--

858
00:32:50,995 --> 00:32:52,981
Seeing you, you coming here,

859
00:32:52,997 --> 00:32:54,692
it's great hanging out with you.
And you're welcome here

860
00:32:54,718 --> 00:32:56,193
any time, but me going to Dillon

861
00:32:56,196 --> 00:32:57,730
that's a whole
different thing.

862
00:32:58,015 --> 00:32:58,851
Apparently.

863
00:32:58,947 --> 00:32:59,753
It is, son.

864
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:00,930
It is.

865
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:02,823
Billy was right.

866
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:06,150
I shouldn't have come here
in the first place.

867
00:33:06,706 --> 00:33:08,010
- It was a mistake.
- Hang on, now.

868
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:09,101
- You made the bet,
- It was a mistake.

869
00:33:09,106 --> 00:33:10,320
and I beat you
fair and square!

870
00:33:10,595 --> 00:33:11,813
Congratulations!

871
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,043
Is that what you need right now?

872
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:15,073
Hey, you be a man--

873
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,122
- Be a man.
- Is that you win?

874
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,743
- Come over here, and shake my hand.
- You win!

875
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:19,233
Hey!

876
00:33:19,628 --> 00:33:20,340
Timmy!

877
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:22,593
You get back over here

878
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:24,292
and shake my hand!

879
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:47,191
Hey.

880
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:51,202
So how was it?

881
00:33:51,227 --> 00:33:52,393
Got the signature.

882
00:33:54,656 --> 00:33:55,671
Dad says hi.

883
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:01,331
I can't believe
you spent the night.

884
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:10,723
What the hell is that?

885
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:11,920
What's going on?

886
00:34:11,955 --> 00:34:13,543
Did you order up
some rally girls?

887
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:14,381
I don't know, maybe.

888
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:16,343
Hi, Tim.

889
00:34:16,477 --> 00:34:18,161
- How you doin', ladies?
- It's time to go.

890
00:34:19,815 --> 00:34:21,653
I'll take some mental notes, Billy.

891
00:34:22,795 --> 00:34:23,413
Hey, Matt.

892
00:34:24,247 --> 00:34:24,910
Time to go!

893
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:26,662
Help these girls
with their fundraising.

894
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:28,250
Why are you touching me?

895
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:31,102
Bye!

896
00:34:31,108 --> 00:34:31,832
Bye.

897
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:39,133
Oh, my God!

898
00:34:39,136 --> 00:34:40,040
Perfect.

899
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:41,863
That's definitely
Mr. October.

900
00:34:48,738 --> 00:34:50,780
Seriously, I don't know
if I can do this.

901
00:34:50,787 --> 00:34:51,552
What don't you know?

902
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:53,240
If Julie finds out
about this--

903
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:54,181
Listen,

904
00:34:54,655 --> 00:34:56,280
you're gonna take
a few pictures.

905
00:34:56,287 --> 00:34:57,473
It's for charity.

906
00:34:58,775 --> 00:35:00,140
Tell me straight up,

907
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:01,303
are you whipped?

908
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,160
Hey, y'all didn't tell me I need
to bring my own wardrobe.

909
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,301
Smash, hey!

910
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:07,173
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up, Smash?

911
00:35:07,176 --> 00:35:08,390
- How you doin', Matty?
- Good.

912
00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:09,823
Hey, I didn't expect
to see you here, man.

913
00:35:12,846 --> 00:35:14,663
I didn't know you had it
in you, baby.

914
00:35:15,606 --> 00:35:16,323
Come on, Matt!

915
00:35:16,326 --> 00:35:17,822
You're gonna be my Mr. November.

916
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:19,641
Come on, Matty, give me
a little Hugh Hefner.

917
00:35:19,648 --> 00:35:20,720
Smash, help me out.

918
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:22,502
Seriously, take it off!

919
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:26,423
Let me do it with my shirt on.

920
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:31,761
Wait, this is seriously--

921
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:36,881
Oh, oh!

922
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:39,691
That's for charity!

923
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:47,651
Come on, Matty, strike a pose!

924
00:35:52,856 --> 00:35:54,102
It's infuriating.

925
00:35:54,355 --> 00:35:56,063
- I'm furious.
- I know.

926
00:35:56,616 --> 00:35:58,012
I mean, how could
the Streets

927
00:35:58,018 --> 00:35:59,563
just listen to some lawyer

928
00:35:59,568 --> 00:36:01,802
who tells them
that they need to sue us?

929
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:03,022
Baby, you know
what you're doing, don't you?

930
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,541
I know, I know. I'm making it worse

931
00:36:04,556 --> 00:36:06,341
I know, I know I need
to just

932
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:08,031
calm down.

933
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:09,820
I need to just be supportive.

934
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:11,683
- I wanna go with you today.
- No

935
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:12,483
- Yes.
- No.

936
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:13,751
I can have my appointments

937
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,381
just changed to tomorrow.

938
00:36:17,268 --> 00:36:19,101
You know what?
There's gonna be--I need that.

939
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:21,600
There are gonna be times
when I need you over

940
00:36:21,618 --> 00:36:23,341
at the courthouse
and times when I don't need you.

941
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:24,953
Believe me,
today I do not need you.

942
00:36:24,957 --> 00:36:26,051
It's only gonna be a hearing.

943
00:36:26,055 --> 00:36:27,370
If I did need you,
I'd let you know.

944
00:36:27,378 --> 00:36:29,202
But I love you very much
for suggesting it.

945
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:30,812
I'm all good.

946
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:34,681
But thank you.

947
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:38,191
I know.

948
00:36:55,326 --> 00:36:56,180
How you doing?

949
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:57,740
I'm doing fine, Coach.
How you doing?

950
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,200
Good.

951
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:02,002
You know we're really not supposed
to be talking too much right now.

952
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:03,802
Screw the lawyers.
It's not about the case.

953
00:37:05,815 --> 00:37:07,262
I heard about you and Lyla.

954
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:12,631
I know what I want.
I don't see why it's such a big deal.

955
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:14,760
I'll tell you what,
it's not a cure-all.

956
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:18,070
It's the biggest damn commitment
you're gonna be making in your life.

957
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,471
Y'all are young.
You better make sure.

958
00:37:21,576 --> 00:37:23,033
You better make damn sure.

959
00:37:24,178 --> 00:37:25,093
I am sure.

960
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:27,460
I am sure.

961
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:29,313
It's her that

962
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:30,660
maybe is not so sure.

963
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:32,061
It seems like she needs a little

964
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:33,623
time to work some stuff out.

965
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:42,863
No one's telling you
you shouldn't get married.

966
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:45,122
What they're saying
is just take some time,

967
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:46,423
feel it out.

968
00:37:49,546 --> 00:37:51,920
Who knows, though? You make
your future father-in-law happy,

969
00:37:51,975 --> 00:37:54,751
you might be able to squeeze
a damn big-ass party out of him.

970
00:37:55,536 --> 00:37:56,381
I don't--

971
00:37:57,295 --> 00:37:59,362
I do not know
about that, sir.

972
00:37:59,798 --> 00:38:01,952
You should have se how pissed
off he was when I told him.

973
00:38:02,076 --> 00:38:03,231
- Was he?
- You shoulda seen him,

974
00:38:03,236 --> 00:38:05,630
]that big head of his.
It was all red and...

975
00:38:14,387 --> 00:38:15,350
All right, Coach.

976
00:38:19,726 --> 00:38:20,512
Hey, Coach.

977
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,650
I'm sorry they're making
you do this on game day.

978
00:38:27,256 --> 00:38:28,520
It wasn't my choice.

979
00:38:34,475 --> 00:38:35,562
See y'all in there.

980
00:38:46,217 --> 00:38:46,953
Hey.

981
00:38:46,955 --> 00:38:48,323
Hey.
I didn't see you in math.

982
00:38:49,506 --> 00:38:50,561
Um,

983
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:52,052
did, uh...

984
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:54,170
Did you finish the book?

985
00:38:54,555 --> 00:38:55,332
I did.

986
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,013
What'd you do last night?

987
00:38:58,248 --> 00:38:59,770
Um, nothing, I just

988
00:38:59,785 --> 00:39:00,900
went to work.

989
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:01,922
And then I went home.

990
00:39:04,146 --> 00:39:05,302
I saw the calendar.

991
00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:06,801
Wh-what?

992
00:39:06,975 --> 00:39:09,750
A bunch of the rally girls were
passing it around this morning.

993
00:39:10,966 --> 00:39:13,283
No, see, they totally
kidnapped me, like,

994
00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:14,942
like, with Riggins
the other night.

995
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,911
But nothing happened.

996
00:39:16,915 --> 00:39:18,043
So it's--

997
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,112
nothing happened at all.

998
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:22,703
Why'd you lie about it?

999
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,332
I don't know.
That was dumb.

1000
00:39:27,186 --> 00:39:30,030
My head's just all foggy

1001
00:39:30,086 --> 00:39:31,562
for some reason.

1002
00:39:31,865 --> 00:39:33,693
I can't imagine why.

1003
00:39:34,948 --> 00:39:36,730
Julie, I'm sorry.
Okay?

1004
00:39:36,737 --> 00:39:37,430
You know what?

1005
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:39,351
I'm sorry too.

1006
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:41,571
- No, don't say that.
- I'm sorry for trusting you.

1007
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:44,270
But I don't appreciate
getting lied to.

1008
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:47,272
So why don't you go

1009
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:48,880
with your little rally girls

1010
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,780
and your football friends
and just leave me alone.

1011
00:40:00,618 --> 00:40:01,901
Pure basic stuff.

1012
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:06,912
I'm sorry.

1013
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:08,682
I was on the other side
of campus.

1014
00:40:09,026 --> 00:40:10,310
You wanted to see me,
Coach?

1015
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:14,662
You're starting to tailback
tonight.

1016
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:22,811
What the hell? You want a hug
or something? Get out of here.

1017
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:29,673
Go ahead.

1018
00:40:36,427 --> 00:40:37,472
Oh, Lord, God, we just ask

1019
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:40,130
that you be with us
on the field tonight.

1020
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:43,001
God, we just ask that you just
inspire us to greatness right now.

1021
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:44,290
God, we ask

1022
00:40:44,298 --> 00:40:45,462
that you protect us, Oh, Lord.

1023
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:48,110
We ask that you make us proud
in defeat

1024
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:49,702
and humble in victory.

1025
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:52,853
But either way, God, we just ask
that you be with us.

1026
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:54,020
God, you know how much we been

1027
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:55,180
through this season.

1028
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:58,741
God, we know that this game
is the key to our destiny, God.

1029
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,660
So we just ask that you give us
courage right now.

1030
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,981
God, we just ask that you give
us strength right now.

1031
00:41:03,988 --> 00:41:05,840
We just ask that you bless

1032
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:07,950
each hand that we hold.
Bless all the fans

1033
00:41:07,956 --> 00:41:10,073
and everybody out there
under those lights tonight,

1034
00:41:11,727 --> 00:41:12,472
Amen.

1035
00:41:12,618 --> 00:41:13,670
Amen!

1036
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:15,371
No tellin', baby.

1037
00:41:15,746 --> 00:41:17,053
It's all you done, baby.

1038
00:41:21,328 --> 00:41:23,043
Put it up!
Put it up!

1039
00:41:23,908 --> 00:41:25,022
I said clear hearts!

1040
00:41:25,028 --> 00:41:25,812
Full hearts!

1041
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:26,761
Can't lose!

1042
00:41:26,768 --> 00:41:27,850
Clear hearts!

1043
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:28,681
Full hearts!

1044
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:30,460
- Can't lose!
- Clear Hearts!

1045
00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:32,122
- Full hearts!
- Can't lose!

1046
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,383
Come on, baby! Let's go!

1047
00:41:40,736 --> 00:41:41,480
Tim!

1048
00:41:41,618 --> 00:41:42,411
Hey, Tim!

1049
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,150
What are you doing?

1050
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:44,933
I need
an extra ticket.

1051
00:41:45,065 --> 00:41:47,012
Too bad, Billy.
The game's about to start.

1052
00:41:47,018 --> 00:41:48,210
- You know that.
- Tim!

1053
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:49,250
What?

1054
00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:51,781
Dad's here.
