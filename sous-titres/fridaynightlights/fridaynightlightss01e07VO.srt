1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,265
What's after high school, Brian?

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,125
Me and Mack Brown gonna
get our win on in Pasadena.

3
00:00:04,225 --> 00:00:07,001
Get my national championship on,
and my Heisman on.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,865
Do you have anyone you're interested in?

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,500
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

6
00:00:10,535 --> 00:00:12,417
Well, forget about sort of.
You know what?

7
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:14,265
Take her out. Movie, dinner.

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,800
Get her in the back seat of your car.
I don't care. Whatever.

9
00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:18,017
I love you.

10
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:20,000
I love you too.

11
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:24,372
What do you want to talk about, Tim?

12
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:27,512
That fact that you're sleeping with
your paralyzed best friend's girlfriend?

13
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:29,159
The three of us together
can get through anything.

14
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:33,600
Anything at all.

15
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:38,393
You think you might have a chance
I don't think so

16
00:00:38,596 --> 00:00:41,591
You're telling me to be nice
I don't think so

17
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:45,791
You want to get in my pants
I don't think so.

18
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:47,102
I don't think so

19
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:55,003
Whoops.

20
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:00,602
Waste of friggin' time, huh?

21
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:03,391
Look, I know you hate me right now,
and I understand.

22
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,352
I don't hate you, Lyla.

23
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,871
It'd be a lot easier if I did.

24
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:13,093
I don't know how to talk to you
when you're like this.

25
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:18,121
I mean, God, it's not even 7:00,
and you can barely stand.

26
00:01:18,508 --> 00:01:20,752
You can blame me if you want, Tim.

27
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:23,553
You can blame the whole world,
for all I care.

28
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:25,042
But if you think being drunk all the time

29
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:27,642
is gonna make this any easier, you're wrong.

30
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:30,300
It's not cool or charming.

31
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:35,581
It's just pathetic and gross.
And I feel sorry for you.

32
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:37,541
I really do.

33
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:38,541
Lyla.

34
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:44,302
Didn't this 2000 championship team

35
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:47,381
have a...star quarterback?

36
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:50,782
Do y'all remember?

37
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:52,261
Hmm?

38
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:55,003
I said, do you remember?

39
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:02,503
<i>Six seconds to go...</i>

40
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:04,963
<i>the Panthers lining up
for a field goal.</i>

41
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:08,460
<i>Mize takes the snap,
he fields it clean.</i>

42
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:12,642
<i>Wait a second, it's a fake!
Alpert's open.</i>

43
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,973
<i>He's got Alpert!
Mize rolling right, throws.</i>

44
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:18,480
<i>He caught it! Robbie Alpert caught
the dadgum ball!</i>

45
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:21,702
<i>Panthers win State!
Panthers win State!</i>

46
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:26,872
Ladies and gentlemen,

47
00:02:26,907 --> 00:02:31,422
All-Region, All-District, All-State--

48
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:34,650
Lucas "The Maneater" Mize.

49
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:43,102
Lucas Mize! Lucas Mize! Lucas Mize!

50
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:46,483
You know, that's gonna
be you one day, Brian.

51
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:49,722
Maybe so, little sister.

52
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,432
Maybe so.

53
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:17,303
Hey, I'm Lucas Mize.

54
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:20,153
Brian. But everybody around
here calls me Smash.

55
00:03:20,185 --> 00:03:23,302
Smash, huh? Did you come up
with that one on your own?

56
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:27,660
Yeah, well,
Maneater was taken.

57
00:03:28,398 --> 00:03:30,451
Oh, yeah. Who was that, anyway?
The Carpenters or something?

58
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:32,172
Who was that?

59
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:35,401
This guy used to drive
22 miles from Macedonia

60
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:37,462
every day of my sophomore year,

61
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:39,811
- just to work me out in private.
- I needed the money.

62
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:42,863
So how are you? How's your family?
What's been going on?

63
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:45,403
I'm selling insurance.
I have an insurance agency in Dallas.

64
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:48,301
In Dallas? I've got a sister in Plano.
You got a card? I'll give it to her.

65
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:50,801
I did, but there's so many people here.
I've been giving them out.

66
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:52,000
Like this guy.?

67
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,703
This guy here is one of the best running backs
in the state of Texas, when he's listening.

68
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,202
... Which is very rare.
- Come on, Coach.

69
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:00,383
- But when he's listening, he's a hell of a running back.
- Is that right?

70
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,702
Well, you must be feeling
the pressure, then.

71
00:04:02,736 --> 00:04:05,501
All the alums back,
big homecoming game.

72
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:07,592
- Oh, I--
- Grady Hunt in the house.

73
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:08,700
Who?

74
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:10,381
You haven't met him yet?

75
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:13,411
Come on, Coach. You gotta take
care of your boy here.

76
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,000
Come with me, kid.

77
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:19,551
- Take care, Lucas.
- Nice to see you, Lucas.

78
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:21,763
-  Good to see you, Mrs. Taylor.
- Ok.

79
00:04:21,806 --> 00:04:24,802
Mr. Hunt's been scouting high school ball
since before we were born.

80
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:26,581
He knows all the recruiters.

81
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:30,552
You make his top 100 list,
you're good to go. He's the man.

82
00:04:31,335 --> 00:04:33,740
- Lucas. How are you, man?
- Doing good. Good to see you.

83
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:34,463
Good to see you.

84
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:37,001
I can bench press 270,

85
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:39,961
dead lift 450,
and run a 4.3, with pads.

86
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:42,352
Plus, my vert's 37 inches,
on a bad day.

87
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:45,360
Last year I got the school record in points
scored, TD catches, and total offense.

88
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:49,603
And the thing about it is, I'm just a junior.
I ain't even started yet.

89
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:52,021
I'm a little worried about confidence.
Yeah.

90
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:56,401
Look, no disrespect, sir.
I just want to say flat out,

91
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,100
if you got a list,

92
00:04:58,225 --> 00:05:00,202
I don't just want to be on it.

93
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:01,763
I want to be number one.

94
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:04,700
Well, I hope you can play
as good as you talk.

95
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,683
Now's your time, son.

96
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,610
Show me what you got.

97
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:12,803
Thank you.

Transcript: Raceman

00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:41,001
Synch: Tauri41

102
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:05,793
Man, who knew
she didn't like sushi?

103
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:08,880
Everybody likes sushi, man.

104
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:11,570
Hey, where are you
right now, man?

105
00:06:11,617 --> 00:06:15,083
- I'm confiding in you, bro.
- Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

106
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:17,401
What, just 'cause I have stumps,
do I not bleed?

107
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:19,170
Dude...

108
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:22,602
All right, so you took her
to Chinese, and--

109
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,751
Dude, I took her to sushi.

110
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:28,252
- Sorry, man, I just got... a lot going on.
- Hey, guys.

111
00:06:29,008 --> 00:06:30,950
- Hey, Coach.
- How you doing, bud?

112
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:32,763
- What's up?
- This is Corey.

113
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:34,400
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

114
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,333
- I got potato chips all over my arm.
- That's all right.

115
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:39,803
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude,
Can I get a second with him?

116
00:06:39,825 --> 00:06:42,600
- Sure. I'll talk to you later.
- Very nice to meet you.

117
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:46,663
- Keep that thought, all right? I'll listen later. I promise.
- Sure.

118
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:50,051
Thank you. How you doing?

119
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:51,801
- I'm doing good.
- Yeah?

120
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:54,460
- Aren't you supposed to be at a party right now?
- No, I was--

121
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:59,800
Pudnick tossed up his nachos during the line dance.
It was a pretty messy  situation.

122
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:03,443
- Did they shut the party down because of it? 
- No, but they should have.

123
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:06,073
Hey, listen...

124
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:11,460
I'm kind of like a designated
ambassador from school right now.

125
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,673
And what I'm asking you is, uh,

126
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:17,742
how would you like to come out
to the game Friday night?

127
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:20,541
It's Homecoming.

128
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:28,202
Uh...I  don't know, Coach.

129
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:33,103
Hey, look, if it's too soon, or, you know,
you're not comfortable with it, I understand.

130
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:35,960
They really want me there?

131
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:38,903
Hell, son, we all want you there.

132
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:44,802
Do  me a favor, would you?

133
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:46,901
Just think about it.

134
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:52,952
Let me tell you, they made money.
I mean, big money.

135
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:56,070
They had kegs, they had girls.
And those college kids were paying $20 a pop,

136
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:58,571
just to get inside the door.
It was out of control.

137
00:07:58,615 --> 00:07:59,953
Now, where was this?

138
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:02,331
Abilene. City of opportunity.

139
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:04,663
And I'm telling you,
it could work here, T.

140
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:08,093
My buddy made a killing
throwing these parties.

141
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,800
What up, baby sis?

142
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:12,463
Seriously, Billy, you still on that?

143
00:08:12,498 --> 00:08:15,960
You're a lot of things,
but party planner, not one of 'em.

144
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:17,532
Your sister here is a small thinker.

145
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:19,942
Big in other areas, but small.

146
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:23,839
It's a dumb idea, asshat. In case you haven't noticed,
this isn't exactly a college town.

147
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,772
But we do have a high school.

148
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,021
It's Homecoming, everybody's
gonna be at the dance.

149
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:30,113
You can't fight tradition, sweetheart.
Not here.

150
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:32,140
- Then we'll start a new one.
- Exactly.

151
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:34,010
The anti-Homecoming.

152
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:37,641
You gotta go.

153
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:40,101
You're too young to be in here, anyway.
Whatever.

154
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:44,103
Hey, clear eyes,
full hearts, can't lose.

155
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:46,303
Damn.

156
00:08:52,238 --> 00:08:54,000
Hey, man.

157
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,380
Just saw your girlfriend.

158
00:08:56,505 --> 00:08:59,801
She is one tall drink of water.

159
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:02,501
Can't imagine how
you screwed that one up.

160
00:09:02,745 --> 00:09:04,081
Here. I'm good.

161
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:08,053
I'm good.

162
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:13,090
- Dude, nightcap. SportsCenter.
- I quit.

163
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,663
You quit? Since when?

164
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:17,593
Since now.

165
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:21,362
Sure you did.

166
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:27,102
We were worried you might get in trouble
for being out all night.

167
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:31,890
What are they gonna do,
throw me in rehab jail?

168
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:37,713
So, do you and Timmy see a lot
of each other now?

169
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:41,150
What do you mean?

170
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:46,363
I don't know, like, in school,
or in practice, or around?

171
00:09:46,395 --> 00:09:48,820
No, not really.

172
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:50,930
Pretty much the same amount.

173
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:03,803
I'm so proud of you, sweetie.

174
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:07,943
Phil says you're doing better
than any patient he's ever had.

175
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:12,393
Phil told me yesterday
to put wax in my hair,

176
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:15,850
so I wouldn't listen
too much what he says.

177
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:22,990
Does your neck hurt
like this?

178
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:25,162
Like I'd tell you if it did?

179
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:27,520
Probably not.

180
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:34,101
Just stop talking about Julie already.

181
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:36,480
You know what?
That's just what I do.

182
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:40,381
You know, I pry, I prod, I wheedle.

183
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,753
You know, even when I get a little crazy sometimes, I cajole.

184
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:45,613
Yeah, but mostly you annoy.

185
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:50,452
Well, it's as easy as this.
If you want it to stop, you ask Julie out on a date.

186
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:53,073
What--I'm really starting
to worry about you.

187
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:55,390
'Cause you've obviously
got the mojo.

188
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:57,503
But you just don't really
know how to use it.

189
00:10:57,547 --> 00:10:58,950
You know what I'm talking about?

190
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:01,003
I really have no idea
what you're talking about.

191
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,871
What you need is to get
the eye of the tiger.

192
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:07,281
You know what I'm talking about.
Boom, baby!

193
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:10,881
 That's it.

194
00:11:12,627 --> 00:11:14,481
Way to work, Riggins!

195
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:18,580
One, nine! Left tuck! Hut! 

196
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:26,680
Way to work it, Smash!
Go!

197
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,280
Way to go, Smash!

198
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:32,760
Hey, look, y'all keep trying,

199
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,001
but you ain't gonna catch me.

200
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:35,600
You're wrong, Williams.

201
00:11:35,677 --> 00:11:37,891
Hey, don't hate, accelerate.

202
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:39,991
Let's go, bring it in on the half.
Come on.

203
00:11:42,108 --> 00:11:44,040
All right, listen up now.

204
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:46,002
The option's just part of what
you're gonna see Friday night.

205
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,870
They're gonna have a man in
motion every play, multiple sets.

206
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,201
They're gonna come in here,
they're gonna try to run and shoot.

207
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:53,703
Let 'em try.
We'll be ready for 'em.

208
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:56,481
I don't expect y'all
to contain this offense.

209
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:59,402
I expect you to shut
the damn thing down, understood?

210
00:11:59,446 --> 00:12:01,503
- Yes, sir.
- All right, let's do it! Break it down.

211
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:02,820
Coach, wait. Hold up.

212
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:07,340
Yo, Hall & Oates...
Let's see if you got any magic left.

213
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:13,141
Hut!

214
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:18,941
Yeah!

215
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:21,850
Hut!

216
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:34,420
All right, Mr. Smash.

217
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,160
Homie, go deep.

218
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:39,592
Hey, man, you can't throw it that far
without your theme music.

219
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:41,991
Hut!
Hut!

220
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:51,401
Nice hands.

221
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,642
Soft  as a Tijuana hooker.

222
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:58,402
All right, I'll call you later.
Bye.

223
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:02,201
So, what do you think?

224
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:06,403
Are you kidding?
There's nothing out here.

225
00:13:06,508 --> 00:13:09,900
Exactly.
So nobody can get in any trouble.

226
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:12,530
Yeah, because nobody's gonna come.

227
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:16,901
- Maybe your sister was right.
- Okay, you need to relax, Mr. Negative.

228
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:20,400
That was her on the phone. She and her
friends are gonna be here all night.

229
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,202
Paying 'em 50 bucks a head,
plus tips.

230
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:24,202
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

231
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:27,103
Hey, every good party needs a hostess,
Billy, and we've got ten of 'em.

232
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:29,130
Ten strippers, actually.

233
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:34,631
I think they prefer the term
"exotic dancer."

234
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:37,301
I don't know,
what do you guys think?

235
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:38,400
Well, I--

236
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:40,831
I think it's great the school
wants to recognize you.

237
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:44,202
You know, and the town too.
You deserve this, Jason.

238
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,701
Honestly, I think it's too soon.

239
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:50,101
Wait a second, now.
Hold on. We discussed this.

240
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:53,003
No, Mitchell, you discussed it.

241
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:55,630
It's barely been two months
since the accident.

242
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,562
The sooner he can get back
to a normal routine, the better.

243
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:00,332
You think this is normal?

244
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,302
Trotting him out in front
of 15,000 people?

245
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:05,701
Mom, let me think
about it, all right?

246
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:07,301
Let's not do this here.

247
00:14:07,537 --> 00:14:09,002
Okay.

248
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:13,532
Steady!

249
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:14,833
Get it.

250
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:19,060
Riggins, you're gonna
give yourself a coronary.

251
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:21,503
<i>- Don't stop!
- Williams!</i>

252
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:23,362
<i>Smash.</i>

253
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,661
<i>Smash, come here.</i>

254
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:31,901
Grady Hunt left a message.
Wants you to call him.

255
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,002
Tell him about me.

256
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:38,402
- Pucker up, Williams.
- That's right, baby,

257
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:40,760
show me some love,
show me some love, baby!

258
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:43,990
Hey, look, this boy's going to Austin.

259
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:46,991
And don't worry, baby,
I'ma bring you back a T-shirt.

260
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:48,131
Longhorns.

261
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:57,802
- How'd you end up in Dallas?
- You know, I just sorta did.

262
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,392
Mm-hmm.

263
00:14:59,535 --> 00:15:01,033
As good a place as any. 

264
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:03,491
How big's the agency up there?

265
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,601
Can I tell you something?

266
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,633
Sure.

267
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,432
- Keep it between us?
- Uh-huh.

268
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:15,061
I don't have an agency.

269
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:18,000
I've just been telling people that
because I

270
00:15:18,307 --> 00:15:20,201
had to tell 'em something.

271
00:15:20,507 --> 00:15:24,503
Sophomore year I blew out my knee,
which sucked.

272
00:15:24,606 --> 00:15:27,103
But  I wasn't playing that much
as it was anyway.

273
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:29,263
Met a girl.

274
00:15:30,107 --> 00:15:32,900
Pretty much lost focus on football.

275
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:36,603
Lost my scholarship,
pretty much dropped out.

276
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:38,602
Never even graduated.

277
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,162
I'm sorry to hear that.
I didn't know.

278
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,661
Coach, listen.

279
00:15:48,506 --> 00:15:49,562
Let me ask you something.

280
00:15:49,706 --> 00:15:50,633
What's that?

281
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:53,703
Could you hire me?

282
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:57,701
I'm kinda putting you on the spot.
I don't--I don't mean to do that. I just--

283
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:01,001
I could log tapes,
I can scout.

284
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:04,203
- Carry the damn water bottles.
- I understand. I can look into it.

285
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:08,360
I can't make any promises
to you, obviously, but I can...

286
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:11,161
You know, I can look into it.
Certainly.

287
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:13,363
That's something.
I appreciate that.

288
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:25,403
Hey, babe.

289
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:26,703
Hey.

290
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:28,903
Did I wake you up?

291
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:30,101
No.

292
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:31,101
Did you sleep at all?

293
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:33,001
Yeah, I got a little bit.

294
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:36,300
How was your dinner with Lucas?

295
00:16:36,337 --> 00:16:37,831
Mmm...

296
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:41,402
- He asked for a job.
- He's got a job.

297
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:43,402
He sells insurance in Dallas.

298
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:47,400
No, he doesn't have a job
selling insurance in Dallas.

299
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,701
He never graduated college, and he's got
four-year-old son that he hardly ever sees,

300
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:53,502
or he's never seen before,
I'm not sure which.

301
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:56,203
That is the most depressing thing
I've ever heard.

302
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,801
I'm not the kid's father.
I don't know why he's coming to me.

303
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:00,502
Listen, that is for sure.

304
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:02,503
- This is not your responsibility--
- I tutored him once,

305
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,401
for one season, six years ago.

306
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:06,403
You know what the problem is,
it's this town, baby.

307
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:08,900
This town makes these teenage kids
into idols.

308
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:11,300
- He's a good kid.
- And then they get out of here,

309
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:13,470
and everybody's not just giving
'em something all the time.

310
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:14,771
They don't know what
to do with themselves.

311
00:17:14,878 --> 00:17:16,840
They fall flat on their faces.
It's a shame.

312
00:17:17,105 --> 00:17:18,981
What are you gonna do?

313
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:23,181
He was the head trainer
for Villanova.

314
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:24,901
You've seriously never
heard about this?

315
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:25,442
No.

316
00:17:25,487 --> 00:17:28,500
See, you gotta remember,
I wasn't even born 1985, old man.

317
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:32,403
Well, the poor bastard had Lou Gehrig's
disease, and he was in a chair.

318
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:36,702
And the whole season, before games,
they rolled him out on the court.

319
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:41,003
Then the team would come out
and rub his head for good luck.

320
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:43,003
It was sick, bro.

321
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:45,163
What's wrong with it?
Sounds fine to me.

322
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:47,263
Well, that's 'cause you're an idiot.

323
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:51,803
Why would you want to let them make you
into some pathetic mascot, huh?

324
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:53,100
It's not a mascot, man.

325
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:55,062
I'd be honored.

326
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:56,260
Get that for me?

327
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:57,403
Yes, sir.

328
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:59,703
If you can move fast enough.

329
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,001
You should see me.
They call me greased lightning.

330
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:05,261
Oh-ho, lovely Lyla.

331
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:06,561
You can leave that.
That's fine.

332
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:08,631
- Oh, okay.
- What?

333
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:11,161
I'm kinda busy.
Strapped into a machine right now.

334
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,063
Don't wanna talk.

335
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:14,363
Something's up.
I can smell it.

336
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:15,703
Yeah, well, that's
none of your business.

337
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:18,500
Oh, come on, what'd you do?
Miss an anniversary?

338
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:21,592
Forgot to thank her for those
Rice Krispie balls, didn't you?

339
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:23,763
No, I didn't do anything.

340
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:29,600
Ah, so Little Miss Perfect's the one
that's in the doghouse. Interesting.

341
00:18:31,668 --> 00:18:35,802
I'm all ears, QB.
The doctor is in.

342
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:37,363
Come on.

343
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:41,501
I, uh--

344
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:45,000
I kinda--

345
00:18:45,436 --> 00:18:48,503
Kinda think she might be
sleeping with my best friend.

346
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:50,660
Oh, wow.

347
00:18:50,705 --> 00:18:53,000
But seriously,
I'm probably just paranoid.

348
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:55,403
- I mean, I've been locked up--
- I'm changing my mind.

349
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:57,403
You gotta go to that game now.

350
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:01,002
You go look that son of a bitch
in the eye, and you see what is up.

351
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:05,100
I don't know, golf bores me.

352
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:06,361
Yeah?

353
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:08,431
Well, I was pretty damn good.

354
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:10,903
I had three top tens on
the Hooters qualifying tour.

355
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:13,700
And if it hadn't been for September 11th,
I probably would have gotten my card.

356
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:18,203
- So, what, it's the terrorists' fault?
- No, I'm not blaming the terrorists.

357
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,862
They cancelled the Texas swing that year.

358
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:22,133
Right when I was on a roll.

359
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:27,003
And then it's Christmas time. My dad leaves us.
And all of a sudden, I got Tim living with me.

360
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:31,460
It was, like, I don't know.
Adios, golf career.

361
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:33,430
Hello, taking care
of your little brother.

362
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:37,500
- What about your mom?
- Well, she was a mess.

363
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:42,302
She spent most of her time
sitting out on the back porch,

364
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:45,502
sucking down bourbon and Cokes,
chain-smoking menthol lights.

365
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:46,961
She was always screaming
about something.

366
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:50,300
You know, in three years,
she never once saw me play football?

367
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:52,401
Sorry.

368
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:57,901
- I don't usually whine.
- No, it's just-- It's just funny.

369
00:19:58,607 --> 00:20:00,602
I learned more about
the Riggins family in two minutes

370
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:02,733
than I did in a whole year of dating Tim.

371
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,802
- He doesn't talk much. 
- No, ma'am.

372
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:08,061
You're right about that.

373
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:17,003
UT, Texas Tech, LSU, USC, Ohio State.

374
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:19,462
I seem to be doing okay.

375
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:21,702
Well, I'm sorry to tell you,
but any kid that can run

376
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,463
20 yards without falling down
gets one of those his junior year.

377
00:20:24,507 --> 00:20:27,000
You need to get serious about this, son.

378
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:29,903
- Treat it like a job.
- Oh, no, I got a plan.

379
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:32,802
I'm  gonna get a scholarship,
I'm gonna go to college,

380
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:33,802
and when I turn pro,

381
00:20:33,908 --> 00:20:36,763
buy my mama the biggest house
in Carr County.

382
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:39,301
Sheila gets the Escalade,
and little sis gets a pony.

383
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,201
Yeah, that's right, Brian.

384
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:47,202
As far as the physical skills go,
don't I got what it takes?

385
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,690
From what I saw today,
it looks pretty good.

386
00:20:49,805 --> 00:20:51,561
It's hard to say yet
on strength and size,

387
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:53,903
- but if you'd be willing--
- Oh, don't even worry about that.

388
00:20:53,906 --> 00:20:55,591
People have been saying
I'm too small since J.V.

389
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:57,530
Ask my mama. She'll tell you.

390
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:59,592
But I've been starting ever since.

391
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:02,031
It's not the size,
it's the heart.

392
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:04,502
Well, I reckon that's
what this game's for.

393
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:05,862
I'll be watching it.

394
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:07,491
And you'll see...

395
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:09,333
Smashball, baby.

396
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:17,112
Is there nowhere we can go
to get away from Homecoming?

397
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:18,460
I mean, so what?

398
00:21:18,495 --> 00:21:20,632
You've graduated,
now you're fat and old.

399
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:22,062
There she is, right there.

400
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:25,393
I really wish you'd just
work with me, Romeo.

401
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:32,302
I mean, come on.
Just go forth, and multiply.

402
00:21:42,037 --> 00:21:44,802
So, what do you think?

403
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:47,103
I don't know, it just seems
a little fancy.

404
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:49,061
Shut up.
That's the whole point.

405
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,861
To make it seem all mysterious.

406
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:52,333
I like 'em, okay?

407
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:55,000
What kind of party
are you trying to throw here?

408
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:56,561
It's gonna be a good one.

409
00:21:58,465 --> 00:22:02,001
Hey, look who it is.
What's going on there, Rocky?

410
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:03,832
Look, it's the new
and improved Tim Riggins.

411
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:07,703
Clean and sober for what?
About 24 hours now, huh?

412
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:09,363
What are you doing here, Tyra?

413
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:11,703
Nothing. Sitting.

414
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:15,490
Nan called from the office.

415
00:22:16,705 --> 00:22:19,131
Said she hopes you're feeling better.

416
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:24,733
I took a sick day, Tim.
It's not a big deal.

417
00:22:24,835 --> 00:22:26,533
Look, all we're doing is
planning a party, Tim.

418
00:22:26,635 --> 00:22:28,803
Not that it's any of your business.

419
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:30,000
You broke up. Remember?

420
00:22:30,636 --> 00:22:32,002
I remember.

421
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:34,533
Show him the flyer.

422
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:39,162
Since when you quit drinking?

423
00:22:39,408 --> 00:22:40,762
So you know what?

424
00:22:40,998 --> 00:22:43,731
Keep your flyer.
You guys have fun.

425
00:22:45,395 --> 00:22:47,163
I think you should come.

426
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:48,802
I don't know.

427
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:51,703
I still don't know
if I'm ready to face everybody yet.

428
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:55,401
You know, it's embarrassing,
being the center of attention and all.

429
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:57,291
Like you're not used
to that?

430
00:22:57,438 --> 00:23:00,501
Well, for football, maybe.
But not for being hurt.

431
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:02,200
I mean, come on, it's like,

432
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,833
"Hey, everybody, come
check out the freak show.

433
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:05,833
Don't feed the animals."

434
00:23:06,408 --> 00:23:08,263
It's not like that.

435
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:12,800
People just want to see you, you know?

436
00:23:13,537 --> 00:23:15,491
I want to see you.

437
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:17,590
Is that right?

438
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:19,732
Mm-hmm.

439
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:21,492
So what are you wearing?

440
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:24,231
Stop it.

441
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:26,500
- Come on, Kermit or Miss Piggy?
- Oh, my God!

442
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:28,830
That's eighth grade, you dork.

443
00:23:36,568 --> 00:23:38,493
I don't know, it's--

444
00:23:38,735 --> 00:23:41,002
Sometimes I wake up
on Fridays, and I--

445
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:44,232
I go to grab my leather jacket, you know?

446
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:49,003
I'm sure it'll
make my dad happy if I go.

447
00:23:49,408 --> 00:23:53,503
He's only called up a zillion times tonight,
trying to convince me.

448
00:23:55,407 --> 00:24:02,400
And, uh...I guess...
you want me to go too?

449
00:24:02,598 --> 00:24:05,202
I just told you I did.

450
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:08,003
Why wouldn't I?

451
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,261
All right.

452
00:24:10,905 --> 00:24:12,902
All right, I'll go.

453
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:16,932
Okay.

454
00:24:17,065 --> 00:24:18,532
Good.

455
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:22,130
Yeah. It'll be fine.

456
00:24:22,907 --> 00:24:24,732
Everything will be fine.

457
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:30,202
One or two tight ends during
the game today?

458
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:32,001
Let's go two.
We gotta go two tights on them.

459
00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:33,402
- Hey.
- You wanted to see me?

460
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:34,300
Yeah.

461
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:36,260
Hey, guys, give me
a second, would you?

462
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:38,703
- Hey, how you doing, Luke?
- Good.

463
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:40,302
- How's everything going?
- Good.

464
00:24:40,408 --> 00:24:42,003
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing fine.

465
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,963
A little stressful around here.

466
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:50,702
Hey, listen...

467
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:53,703
I can't hire you.
I'm sorry.

468
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:55,400
The budget's tight, and, you know,

469
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:58,902
there's just no room
for another assistant right now.

470
00:24:59,006 --> 00:25:00,102
That's just the way it is.

471
00:25:02,005 --> 00:25:04,202
- Did you even ask?
- Yeah, I sure did ask.

472
00:25:04,265 --> 00:25:05,901
You know, it's a process.

473
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,903
You know, a process is what it is.
We're three games into the season right now.

474
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,202
We can't afford another assistant.
That's the fact of the matter right there.

475
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:14,700
You know, you go around to another school.
You ask around,

476
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:17,101
something comes up,
I'm more than happy to help out.

477
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:18,433
Coach, listen,
I need this now.

478
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:20,701
I understand that.
If it was the beginning of the season,

479
00:25:20,807 --> 00:25:23,501
it'd be a different story, but it's not.
That's just the situation.

480
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:26,900
I'll keep my ears open for you.
I'll do what I can for you.

481
00:25:27,107 --> 00:25:29,931
Yeah, don't hold your breath.

482
00:25:31,308 --> 00:25:33,363
Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't
do more for you.

483
00:25:47,305 --> 00:25:48,601
Good God, Tyra.

484
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:50,601
We've gotta have an open bar.

485
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:53,501
Yeah, but don't you think it's a little much?
We already ordered 16 kegs.

486
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:57,201
- Actually, it was 22.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

487
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,802
The worst thing that could happen is that
we run out of booze in the middle of the party.

488
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:01,101
We're not gonna have time
to come running back here.

489
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,303
- Yeah, I know, but--
- So get with the program.

490
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:06,300
If we want this thing to be a hit,
we gotta think big, okay?

491
00:26:06,408 --> 00:26:08,801
Just trust me on this.

492
00:26:25,006 --> 00:26:26,301
Hey.

493
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,432
Whatcha doing?

494
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:34,101
- We got a game, Coach.
- I know, in about four hours.

495
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:37,233
Yeah, I'm just trying
to get my mind right, you know.

496
00:26:37,605 --> 00:26:38,463
Do my thing.

497
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,430
All right.

498
00:26:43,705 --> 00:26:44,601
Hey, Coach?

499
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:45,933
Hmm?

500
00:26:46,265 --> 00:26:48,662
What you know about
this Grady Hunt guy?

501
00:26:49,205 --> 00:26:50,500
Grady Hunt?
Grady Hunt?

502
00:26:50,505 --> 00:26:53,601
I know Grady Hunt has
a list of people like you on it

503
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:55,400
to look at. Why?

504
00:26:55,506 --> 00:26:58,033
Everybody says he has the power
to make or break you.

505
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:03,003
He ain't no Jesus
or nothin', but... he's coming.

506
00:27:03,406 --> 00:27:04,731
It's just a lot, that's all.

507
00:27:05,505 --> 00:27:07,661
Let me tell you something.
You're a prospect.

508
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:11,501
There's gonna be a lot of Grady Hunts
coming in and out of here

509
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:13,500
the next few years,
looking at you.

510
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:16,103
- You think so?
- I know so.

511
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:18,363
And I'll tell you something else.

512
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:23,000
Grady Hunt is not gonna
make or break number 20. You are.

513
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:25,501
You go out there tonight,
you focus on this game.

514
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,443
You focus on this game alone.

515
00:27:27,565 --> 00:27:29,660
You'll be fine.
You understand me?

516
00:27:30,195 --> 00:27:31,300
Yes, sir.

517
00:27:31,437 --> 00:27:33,532
You're right.

518
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:38,863
We're all good?

519
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:40,902
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.

520
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:43,400
- All ready.
- All right.

521
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:58,602
All right, move these over there, boys.

522
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:01,101
Just set 'em-- Unh!
Don't hurt yourself.

523
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:04,002
We got lots more to go.
All right?

524
00:28:04,806 --> 00:28:06,031
Yeah...

525
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,401
<i>It is Homecoming, Panther fans,</i>

526
00:28:14,457 --> 00:28:17,203
<i>and have we got a good one
for you here tonight.</i>

527
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:20,200
<i>Sammy, you can just feel the electricity
here in the football stadium.</i>

528
00:28:20,318 --> 00:28:24,602
<i>And Laribee has taken the field,
and this crowd is rockin'</i>

529
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:26,903
<i>as we wait for the Panthers.</i>

530
00:28:39,077 --> 00:28:41,571
<i>And here are...</i>

531
00:28:41,607 --> 00:28:43,200
<i>your Dillon Panthers!</i>

532
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,530
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

533
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:07,200
<i>please welcome tonight's
honorary Dillon captain,</i>

534
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:11,733
<i>number 6, Jason Street!</i>

535
00:29:25,006 --> 00:29:28,501
<i>Jason! Jason!</i>

536
00:29:33,635 --> 00:29:36,071
<i>Let's go! Let's go, baby!</i>

537
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:00,371
Clear eyes, full hearts,
can't lose!

538
00:30:00,455 --> 00:30:04,573
<i>Clear eyes, full hearts,
can't lose!</i>

539
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,790
<i>Welcome back to tonight's
district match-up.</i>

540
00:30:21,006 --> 00:30:23,632
<i>Dillon trying to get past
that forfeit to Arnett Mead</i>

541
00:30:23,736 --> 00:30:25,430
<i>because of Ray "Voodoo" Tatom.</i>

542
00:30:25,605 --> 00:30:27,302
<i>And the Panthers need a win to keep</i>

543
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:28,700
<i>their playoff hopes alive.</i>

544
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:32,401
<i>And it's gonna be a very emotional night
with the return of Jason Street</i>

545
00:30:32,488 --> 00:30:33,900
<i>to Herrmann Field.</i>

546
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,410
<i>And word is out Grady Hunt
is in the house</i>

547
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:38,411
<i>to see Smash Williams do his thing.</i>

548
00:30:38,415 --> 00:30:40,470
All right, let's go,
lock and load, let's play ball!

549
00:30:40,477 --> 00:30:43,301
<i>Keller opens left, reverses field.</i>

550
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:45,311
<i>It's an option, he pitches.
No, he keeps it!</i>

551
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:47,272
<i> This kid has got some wheels.</i>

552
00:30:47,315 --> 00:30:50,412
<i>Oh, and a big gain
for the Laribee quarterback.</i>

553
00:30:53,547 --> 00:30:56,241
<i>He's got room.
He's hit hard at the line.</i>

554
00:30:56,296 --> 00:30:57,902
<i>Oh, and he's in for a touchdown.</i>

555
00:30:58,007 --> 00:31:01,701
<i>Just like that, Coach Taylor's
gonna find himself down seven points.</i>

556
00:31:04,177 --> 00:31:05,842
Come on, show us
some of that speed, Smash.

557
00:31:05,848 --> 00:31:07,473
<i>I-right, Y flip-28 zone.</i>

558
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:09,243
<i>On one. Ready, break.</i>

559
00:31:09,248 --> 00:31:10,372
<i>Okay, Panther fans,</i>

560
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:12,442
<i>let's see what Smash has brought.</i>

561
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:15,101
<i>Saracen takes the snap, hands the ball
off to Williams on the right side.</i>

562
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,002
<i>He turns the corner--
Oh, and he gets pasted.</i>

563
00:31:19,536 --> 00:31:21,533
<i>Saracen's got Williams open
on the left flank--</i>

564
00:31:21,536 --> 00:31:24,000
<i>Oh, and he just plumb drops the ball.</i>

565
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:26,000
<i>I'll tell you what, he had
nothing but blue skies</i>

566
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:29,162
<i>and open fields between him
and the end zone.</i>

567
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:33,502
<i>Riggins gets the ball, and he powers
up the middle for six yards.</i>

568
00:31:33,636 --> 00:31:35,101
<i>Late in the second quarter, Panthers</i>

569
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,800
<i>with a fourth and one</i>

570
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:37,801
<i>on their own 45.</i>

571
00:31:37,907 --> 00:31:39,201
<i>Saracen hands the ball off to Dolia.</i>

572
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:41,930
<i>Wait, it's a reverse to Smash Williams!</i>

573
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:48,562
<i>Smash Williams just can't seem
to get on track tonight.</i>

574
00:31:48,996 --> 00:31:51,991
<i>This Panther team has been
shut out in the first half.</i>

575
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:53,991
<i>Coach Taylor needs to circle the wagons</i>

576
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,103
<i>and find some answers fast,
'cause this is gonna turn into a massacre.</i>

577
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:57,960
<i>You guys gotta wait</i>

578
00:31:57,965 --> 00:32:00,000
<i>on making those reads!</i>

579
00:32:03,135 --> 00:32:05,991
Let's go, right now.

580
00:32:11,006 --> 00:32:12,971
We're losing out there.
What the hell's going on?!

581
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:14,291
Coach, look, they're not
holding their blocks.

582
00:32:14,297 --> 00:32:15,102
I can't get around 'em.

583
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:16,732
You are running into your own protection.

584
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:17,643
The holes are open.

585
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:19,703
Why are you running into your own protection?

586
00:32:19,707 --> 00:32:22,202
Why aren't you being patient?
Read the blocks, hit the gaps.

587
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:24,303
Read the blocks, hit the gaps.

588
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:26,200
Yes, sir.

589
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,303
The problem is--

590
00:32:27,337 --> 00:32:29,033
I'll tell you what
the problem is, Smash.

591
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:31,130
The problem is the guy out there
with the damn clipboard.

592
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:32,700
That's the problem.
That's the problem.

593
00:32:32,796 --> 00:32:34,431
You don't play for UT.

594
00:32:34,507 --> 00:32:36,502
You play Dillon Panther
high school football.

595
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:39,301
And you play for me.
So forget the damn list!

596
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:41,900
- I'm gonna make it up to you.
- Yes, you are!

597
00:32:42,005 --> 00:32:44,102
'Cause if you don't,
I'm gonna make some changes out there.

598
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,562
I promise you that!

599
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:50,631
<i>Starting the second half here,</i>

600
00:32:50,908 --> 00:32:54,001
<i>and these Panther fans without
a whole lot to celebrate</i>

601
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,760
<i>on Homecoming so far.</i>

602
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,061
<i>Down ten points, we're gonna
see how many touches</i>

603
00:32:58,106 --> 00:33:00,132
<i>Smash Williams'll get.</i>

604
00:33:04,506 --> 00:33:05,931
<i>He takes the snap.</i>

605
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:09,701
<i>Oh, Williams gets hit hard again.</i>

606
00:33:09,706 --> 00:33:11,893
<i>And the ball's loose! Fumble!</i>

607
00:33:12,006 --> 00:33:13,660
<i>Oh, and Laribee's picking it up.</i>

608
00:33:15,496 --> 00:33:16,790
What are you doing?

609
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:19,061
<i>They are not gonna catch him,
and that is a touchdown</i>

610
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:20,232
<i>for the Laribee Lions.</i>

611
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:23,082
<i>And just like that, folks,
the Panthers are down</i>

612
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:25,932
<i>here in the third quarter, 17 to nothing.</i>

613
00:33:25,968 --> 00:33:27,131
<i>I don't know what's wrong.</i>

614
00:33:27,165 --> 00:33:28,601
<i>This team is just struggling tonight.</i>

615
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:30,863
<i>They continue to be out of synch--Oh!</i>

616
00:33:30,906 --> 00:33:32,961
<i>And Smash Williams has just
thrown his helmet</i>

617
00:33:33,008 --> 00:33:34,360
<i>to the ground in frustration.</i>

618
00:33:36,636 --> 00:33:39,501
That's it,
we're going with Riggins.

619
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:42,503
I-right, 42 swing pass, on one.
Ready, break!

620
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:45,562
<i>And Coach Taylor has
Tim Riggins lined up</i>

621
00:33:45,605 --> 00:33:48,230
<i>as the lone tailback.</i>

622
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:50,901
<i>And the ball is given to Riggins.</i>

623
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:54,062
<i>And he picks up a quick ten yards.</i>

624
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:57,061
<i> Riggins again up the middle.</i>

625
00:33:57,105 --> 00:34:01,100
<i>And he bulldozes his way in,
and it's a touchdown!</i>

626
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:07,963
<i>And with Riggins as the new
go-to workhorse tonight,</i>

627
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:10,103
<i>Dillon can't be stopped.</i>

628
00:34:10,537 --> 00:34:11,430
Get 'em!

629
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:12,732
I'm on you. Let's go!

630
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:15,430
<i>Handoff to Riggins.</i>

631
00:34:21,705 --> 00:34:23,862
<i>Touchdown!
Touchdown, Dillon Panthers!</i>

632
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:30,632
<i>And Taylor may have finally
found his answer</i>

633
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:34,860
<i>in the power running
of big Tim Riggins.</i>

634
00:34:37,036 --> 00:34:39,101
Go, come on!

635
00:34:39,137 --> 00:34:41,860
<i>Riggins picks up a good block.</i>

636
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:52,000
<i>That is a touchdown!</i>

637
00:34:52,035 --> 00:34:54,133
<i>Touchdown, Dillon Panthers.</i>

638
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:05,330
Way to play, Riggins.

639
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:27,102
All right, listen up!

640
00:35:27,138 --> 00:35:29,161
Listen, now.

641
00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:32,160
Y'all ought to be
real proud of yourselves.

642
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,903
That was a hell
of an effort tonight.

643
00:35:33,935 --> 00:35:35,603
<i>It was a hell of a game.</i>

644
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,802
I don't know how in the hell he did it,

645
00:35:38,835 --> 00:35:41,430
or where he came from
to do it, or what have you,

646
00:35:41,466 --> 00:35:44,061
but I know who
this game ball goes to.

647
00:35:50,967 --> 00:35:52,002
Thank you.

648
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:55,133
That was one hell of a game.

649
00:35:55,168 --> 00:35:56,901
- Thanks.
- All of y'all.

650
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:58,700
That was one hell of a game!

651
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:05,462
<i>Speech, come on!
Panther pride!</i>

652
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:06,903
<i>Speech!</i>

653
00:36:06,936 --> 00:36:08,602
Well...

654
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:09,763
I, uh...

655
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:14,361
I'm not very good
at this kind of stuff, so...

656
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:17,831
Coach is always talking about, uh...

657
00:36:17,868 --> 00:36:19,930
one team and one heart.

658
00:36:21,238 --> 00:36:23,901
To be honest with you, I thought it was--

659
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:26,602
I thought it was stupid.

660
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:29,233
Fact is, he's right.

661
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:30,800
He's right.

662
00:36:31,366 --> 00:36:34,602
Everybody in this room knows who...

663
00:36:37,806 --> 00:36:40,401
where we get our heart from.

664
00:36:41,106 --> 00:36:43,561
He's sitting right there.

665
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,602
This ball belongs to you.

666
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:56,903
Please, take it.

667
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:04,101
I love you like a brother.

668
00:37:06,806 --> 00:37:08,701
Like a brother, Six.

669
00:37:15,037 --> 00:37:16,131
What are y'all staring at?

670
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:18,203
Y'all played a hell of a game.
Go party!

671
00:37:36,305 --> 00:37:38,702
Well, don't you say
one word to your brother.

672
00:37:38,755 --> 00:37:41,992
Not one word. Just wait here.

673
00:37:42,105 --> 00:37:44,803
Baby, it's okay.
It's just one game.

674
00:37:44,907 --> 00:37:46,491
I blew it.
I blew it.

675
00:37:46,596 --> 00:37:48,162
I had my one chance, and I blew it.

676
00:37:48,296 --> 00:37:50,931
I didn't even touch the ball
the second half of the game.

677
00:37:50,965 --> 00:37:53,192
Everybody know that I'm
this family's meal ticket.

678
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:55,502
Now, that's crazy talk.
You know better than that.

679
00:37:55,596 --> 00:38:00,201
You know it. I know it.
And this whole damn world knows it.

680
00:38:00,805 --> 00:38:03,661
Look, I'm sorry.

681
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,663
I just--
I need to be alone.

682
00:38:05,707 --> 00:38:06,962
Brian. Brian!

683
00:38:22,506 --> 00:38:23,632
Little brother, what is up, man?

684
00:38:23,685 --> 00:38:26,402
- Hell of a game tonight, man!
- Thank you.

685
00:38:34,608 --> 00:38:37,260
Why don't you come back in about four years?

686
00:38:37,396 --> 00:38:38,832
I'll give you one on the house.

687
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:41,130
Think maybe I can get that in writing?

688
00:38:41,198 --> 00:38:42,133
You're cute.

689
00:38:42,307 --> 00:38:43,931
I'm cute?

690
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,000
I gotta be up early, son.

691
00:38:54,108 --> 00:38:55,903
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't mean to bother you.

692
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:57,903
But I was just wondering

693
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,002
if there's any chance
I'm gonna make that list.

694
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,501
You had a rough time out there tonight.

695
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:07,200
Yes, sir, I did.
But I didn't get my touches, and--

696
00:39:07,397 --> 00:39:09,560
They don't want to hear excuses.

697
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:11,562
No, sir.

698
00:39:12,608 --> 00:39:15,500
To be honest, I'm worried
about your strength and size.

699
00:39:15,607 --> 00:39:20,093
So what you should work on
is lifting and conditioning.

700
00:39:20,607 --> 00:39:22,493
Yes, sir.
I appreciate that.

701
00:39:22,535 --> 00:39:24,203
I'm gonna keep on pushing,

702
00:39:24,307 --> 00:39:26,462
but I was just wondering
if I'm gonna make that list.

703
00:39:27,205 --> 00:39:28,960
Comes out in January.

704
00:39:29,908 --> 00:39:31,233
Thank you.

705
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:40,500
It's gonna be 20 bucks a pop.

706
00:39:40,707 --> 00:39:43,301
Man, these people are
wearing my ass down.

707
00:39:43,405 --> 00:39:47,261
It's all the Red Bull and vodka.
They're either gonna pass out, or run the marathon.

708
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:50,333
Come on.

709
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:53,833
Hey.

710
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:56,691
Hey, what's goin' on?

711
00:39:56,738 --> 00:39:59,033
Not much.
Is this the safe zone?

712
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:01,863
Yeah, I know.
These people are crazy.

713
00:40:06,806 --> 00:40:11,161
So, it must feel pretty good,
winning the big homecoming game and all.

714
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,830
Would you go on a date with me?

715
00:40:18,797 --> 00:40:20,930
Um... Maybe, or not.
I mean--

716
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:25,491
I just thought I'd throw that out there.

717
00:40:25,537 --> 00:40:28,231
But it's prob--
It's probably a bad idea.

718
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:07,490
So, how'd we do?

719
00:41:08,437 --> 00:41:12,093
60, 70, 80.

720
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,992
$4,680.

721
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:17,330
Which comes out to...

722
00:41:17,865 --> 00:41:20,832
A whole lot of damn money
for throwing a stupid party.

723
00:41:20,865 --> 00:41:21,833
Yeah.

724
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:23,133
This is unbelievable.

725
00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:25,003
So let me ask you a question.

726
00:41:25,595 --> 00:41:28,093
How do I know you didn't pocket
a little bit of extra cash

727
00:41:28,135 --> 00:41:30,132
when you were lettin' people in
through the door?

728
00:41:30,408 --> 00:41:32,192
The same way I know you're
gonna share those tips

729
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:35,000
you made at the bar with me.
Trust.

730
00:41:41,638 --> 00:41:42,762
Wow.

731
00:41:46,197 --> 00:41:47,630
Nice.

732
00:42:12,298 --> 00:42:14,692
<i>Come on, baby, you got game film.</i>

733
00:42:14,735 --> 00:42:16,003
I'm coming.
