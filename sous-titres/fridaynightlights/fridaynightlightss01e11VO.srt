00:00:00,038 --> 00:00:02,713
Here's to God.
and ten years from now, Street,

2
00:00:02,734 --> 00:00:04,856
good friends living large in Texas.

3
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:07,806
- Is it true, Mr. Street?
- That I love Lyla Garrity?

4
00:00:07,619 --> 00:00:12,011
Street's the only one able to get to him.
Looks like a gigantic hit on Street.

5
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:15,051
- ...Quarterback. no one's seen this guy--
- Throw the ball.

6
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:17,467
- Hey, boy, how you doing?
- Doing good. How you doing?

7
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:18,898
Well, I'm hanging in here, man.

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,733
Your dad in Iraq--
that must be hard.

9
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:23,279
- Did You forget to take your pills yesterday?
- No.

10
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:25,870
Looks like she wandered into a 
neighbor's house around the block.

11
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:27,752
- Is she all right?
- Found her taking a bath.

12
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:28,722
They said it's dementia.

13
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:31,769
- She's okay now?
- She's fine. She's grandma, you know?

14
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,100
Jason's paralyzed.

15
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:37,520
My legs are never gonna get better.
You and me, we're not getting married.

16
00:00:37,565 --> 00:00:39,630
- Don't say that, Jason.
- Lyla

17
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:43,162
What happened with us came from
all these feelings about Jason.

18
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:45,832
- Is something happening between you and Riggins?
- No!

19
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:49,683
You don't steal a cripple's girl.
You're a coward, Riggins!

20
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,262
Welcome home.

21
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:56,620
You are all that I have in the whole world.
It's all I have.

22
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:43,633
Come on.

23
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:52,682
Where's my Nevermind CD?

24
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:54,770
I don't know.
Did you leave it in your room?

25
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:57,262
No, I didn't leave it
in my room!

26
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:00,211
It should be right here
with the rest of Nirvana.

27
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:02,432
Can you get it off of the computer?

28
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:05,150
No!
I can't get it on my computer! I just--

29
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,860
I just-- I wanna listen to it,
and I want the CD,

30
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:10,110
and I want it right now.

31
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,821
I don't understand why this
is something to get so upset over.

32
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:16,013
Because I'm crippled,
and I wanna listen to Nirvana!

33
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:19,561
Is that so hard to understand?
Huh?

34
00:02:22,237 --> 00:02:24,573
I'll just have to get myself
another one.

35
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:28,560
Sweetheart, the record store's
like 4 miles away.

36
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:30,291
Well,

37
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,900
I better get goin'.

38
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:30,650
You can find Clay Aiken under A.

39
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:38,340
- Like he's not your boyfriend.
- Hey,

40
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,582
what Clay and I have is special, okay?

41
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:43,912
America loves him, and so do I.
You just need to start respecting that.

42
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:46,540
Why don't you send me
an invitation to the wedding?

43
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:50,373
I would, but it's just gonna be
the two of us and, uh

44
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:52,810
a harpist.
And, uh,

45
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:55,450
Ryan Seacrest is gonna perform
the ceremony.

46
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,602
Nice.

47
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:08,162
- Hi.
- Hi.

48
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:18,101
- How are you?
- Great. And you?

49
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:19,812
I'm okay.

50
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:25,141
Jason, hi. Lyla, we gotta go.
We're gonna be late for class.

51
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:28,472
- You gotta go.
- Unless I don't.

52
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,832
I know we have
a lot to talk about.

53
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:40,880
- Maybe--
- Yeah, yeah. We should go somewhere.

54
00:04:45,476 --> 00:04:46,692
How do we do this?

55
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:49,702
I'm not really sure.

56
00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:57,972
- What if I put my leg on your shoulder?
- Higher up.

57
00:04:58,108 --> 00:04:59,801
Come on, here!

58
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:04,461
Okay, okay.
I got an idea. Hop off.

59
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,061
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

60
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:17,921
I'm fine.

61
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:19,961
I'm good, I'm good.

62
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:23,141
Stop gawking at me
and come here.

63
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:44,403
It's okay.
It's okay.

64
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:53,702
I--I can't. Lyla, stop.
I can't feel anything.

69
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:56,752
Man, look, it's just--

70
00:06:56,886 --> 00:06:58,731
Yeah, I know, Medicare--

71
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:01,051
Medicare says that
they'll pay for all that,

72
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:02,721
but for some reason,
I have this bill

73
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:05,471
saying that I owe $348.

74
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,772
Matthew?

75
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:09,612
Matthew, have you got
that leaky faucet fixed yet?

76
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:12,270
- Um, yeah, I know--
- Get your dad to help you.

77
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:15,211
Grandma, Dad's in Iraq,
remember?

78
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:18,211
So,  look, what I'm really
trying to figure out here

79
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,411
- is if you can maybe arrange some kind of...
- He's out front

80
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:21,923
- in-home visits or something...
-  Go help him.

81
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:24,523
if, you know, Medicare
will pay for that as well.

82
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:29,310
Can--can you hold on one sec?

83
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:30,793
Go help him with his bags.

84
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:33,792
- All right. I'm gonna go look, okay?
- Yeah.

85
00:07:39,898 --> 00:07:41,473
Dad?

86
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:46,231
Matt.

87
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:48,423
You're home!

88
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:53,122
You're home!
You're home!

89
00:07:54,027 --> 00:08:00,661
P-A-N-T-H-E-R-S.

90
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,081
Bring it in, guys.

91
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:06,083
Bring 'em in, guys!
Let's go, let's go!

92
00:08:06,308 --> 00:08:08,560
Listen up--perfection
is the order of the day.

93
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,291
Anything else
is unacceptable, understood?

94
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,091
Yes, sir.

95
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,631
We leave the mistakes
up to the Westcott Warriors.

96
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:16,842
Also, First Baptist is having
their annual Panther dinner

97
00:08:17,068 --> 00:08:19,002
on Thursday night,
so you'll be there.

98
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:20,983
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
I don't wanna hear it.

99
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:23,682
You'll have your jackets.
You'll have your ties.

100
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,412
There's gonna be
no foul language.

101
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:27,172
You're not gonna make
jackasses out of yourself.

102
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:28,411
Don't embarrass me.

103
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:29,671
Don't embarrass the school.

104
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:30,850
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

105
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:32,950
All right, coach,
break it down.

106
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:35,641
Come on, let's hit it!

107
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:37,803
One, two, three!
Can't lose!

108
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:39,102
Miss Levine told me

109
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:40,771
that you're in real trouble
in her English class.

110
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,900
Yeah, well, why don't we just
put me into an easier class?

111
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:46,831
That's not really
the problem, is it?

112
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:49,461
I hear you got an oral report
due this week.

113
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:51,532
You started reading
that book yet?

114
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,531
Uh, no, I haven't,

115
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,661
but I am
lookin' forward to it.

116
00:08:56,825 --> 00:08:58,131
You get help
on your homework, Tim?

117
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:00,600
Maybe from
the Rally Girls sometimes?

118
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:01,933
No.

119
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:03,801
Never.

120
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,462
Not once.

121
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:06,830
All right, you know,

122
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,961
that Scarlet Letter paper 
that y'all wrote--

123
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,203
I mean, Julie was up all night
long writing that one.

124
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:14,603
Did--did you write that one?
Oh, yeah.

125
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,632
You did?
Yep.

126
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:16,833
Oh!
Could I see it?

127
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:22,463
Wow, "Modern Themes
in The Scarlet Letter."

128
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:24,331
A -.
Look at that.

129
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:26,563
What's The Scarlet Letter
about, Tim?

130
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:28,662
You know
what it's about.

131
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:30,702
- I do know.
- Yeah.

132
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,623
What's  The Scarlet Letter
about?

133
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:36,903
It's about, uh,
a gal that, uh,

134
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:38,403
named Scarlet, obviously--

135
00:09:38,507 --> 00:09:40,203
Tim,

136
00:09:40,235 --> 00:09:41,832
you did not write
this paper.

137
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:43,600
What's the big deal?

138
00:09:43,636 --> 00:09:45,563
Well, the big deal is
that it's part of my job

139
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:47,930
to make sure that
you don't grow up stupid.

140
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,632
It's bad for the world.

141
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:51,731
That's not funny, Tim.

142
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,661
That is not funny.

143
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:55,600
So you know what--I'm making it
my personal responsibility

144
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:58,102
to make sure that you don't
get any more free passes

145
00:09:58,107 --> 00:09:59,502
from your teachers.

146
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:02,239
From here on in, you're gonna
sink or you're gonna swim,

147
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,941
based on you,
based on your work.

148
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:04,923
You get me?

149
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:08,332
We're two wins away
from playoffs, Mrs. Taylor.

150
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:09,373
I appreciate that.

151
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:10,752
The timing of this
couldn't be worse.

152
00:10:10,755 --> 00:10:12,653
Well, I'm sorry.

153
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:14,551
I don't pass,
I don't play.

154
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:17,132
Well, then, I think
we'd better get you to pass.

155
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:20,583
Yep!
Yeah!

156
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:23,203
Oh, yeah!
Yeah, baby!

157
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:24,830
Mike Jones

158
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:26,963
for the ladies,
baby, yeah!

159
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:28,932
Good Lord,
that boy's good.

160
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:29,901
Herc.

161
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:31,061
Hmm?

162
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:32,702
How do I have sex?

163
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:36,960
Oh, my goodness.
My boy's growin' up.

164
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,033
No, seriously.

165
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,802
I just need
a little information.

166
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:42,303
I kinda had a...

167
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:45,100
a little--
a little mishap, if you will.

168
00:10:45,137 --> 00:10:46,903
Mishap?

169
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,131
- Yeah.
- By yourself or with a girl?

170
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:50,401
With a girl.

171
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:53,761
I just--
I was having trouble, uh--

172
00:10:53,805 --> 00:10:56,233
I was having trouble...

173
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:58,432
staying at attention.

174
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:00,233
You know what I mean?

175
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,060
I do know
what you mean,

176
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:03,733
but I'm proud of you
anyway.

177
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:06,401
Where'd you find her?
It's not important.

178
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:07,962
I didn't catch
that name.

179
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:10,163
Who was this again?

180
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:11,200
It was Lyla.

181
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,300
Come on.

182
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,263
No!

183
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:15,632
Boo!
Uh-uh!

184
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,633
What--
what are you sayin' to me?

185
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,602
Well, of course
your ding dong went soft.

186
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,232
- It was tryin' to protect you.
- I know, I know.

187
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:23,932
All right, it wasn't,
like, my proudest moment,

188
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:25,762
but if you'd hold back
on the judgment

189
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:27,652
just a little bit right now,
that'd be great.

190
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:29,152
'Cause this is really
helping me right now.

191
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,081
I know what you want.
I know what you want.

192
00:11:31,115 --> 00:11:33,012
You wanna grab her
and do her, huh?

193
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:35,012
- Make her forget about that other guy, right?
- Yes.

194
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:36,910
Just bang
the bejesus out of her.

195
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:38,952
Exactly.
That's exactly what I wanna do.

196
00:11:38,986 --> 00:11:40,612
Yeah.
Not gonna happen.

197
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,450
Least not for a while, anyway.

198
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,012
Why not?

199
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:51,802
Dude, you're like
a newborn baby.

200
00:11:51,848 --> 00:11:53,803
You don't know how
to do anything.

201
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,503
Look, man, whatever
worked for you before

202
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:58,570
may not work now,
you know?

203
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:01,970
You just gotta figure out
what turns you on, you know?

204
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:04,601
Like, will I ever
be able to--

205
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:05,971
What, shoot fireworks?

206
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:07,572
- Yeah.
- Have a super happy fun time?

207
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:08,571
- Yeah.
- Yes.

208
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:11,272
Probably.
Just maybe not every time.

209
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:15,102
Look,

210
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:18,772
nothing's like it was,
you know?

211
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:21,270
But don't look so glum, man.

212
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:24,242
There's more to life
than hit it and quit it, QB,

213
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,443
trust me.

214
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:32,003
Landry.

215
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:33,941
Landry.
Hi.

216
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:35,391
How you doing?

217
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:36,653
Good.

218
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:38,003
Do you know
Tim Riggins?

219
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,272
He's lookin' for
an English tutor,

220
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:41,441
and I think you would
be just perfect.

221
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:42,603
Do  you?

222
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,100
Yeah, I do, and I just
want you to know

223
00:12:45,145 --> 00:12:47,372
that he wants to really
improve his grades.

224
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:49,301
He's looking
to expand his mind.

225
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:50,700
Don't go easy on him.

226
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,440
Spend as much time
as you need.

227
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:54,671
Do whatever you need to do,
and y'all get in there

228
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:56,240
and get it goin'.

229
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:58,072
And I think you'll be great.
Thanks, Landry.

230
00:12:58,107 --> 00:12:59,103
Okay, um--

231
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,973
Good luck.

232
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:01,752
Okay.

233
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:06,631
Go!

234
00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:12,100
Set!

235
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,472
Hut!

236
00:13:17,177 --> 00:13:18,731
There it is.

237
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:20,400
That's nice, Matt.

238
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:21,571
That's nice.

239
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:27,500
Set.

240
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:28,883
Coach Taylor, you seen this?

241
00:13:29,235 --> 00:13:29,841
Huh?

242
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:32,040
Texas Football magazine.

243
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,571
Top ten high school coaches
in the state of Texas.

244
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,700
- You're on this list?
- Right there, Coach.

245
00:13:36,737 --> 00:13:38,473
Oh, there's no livin'
with him now.

246
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:41,831
Better watch what you say.
Says "up and coming."

247
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,371
How 'bout that?

248
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,473
Coach, we're getting T-shirts
with that on it.

249
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:47,600
- It'll be on the radio.
- Sweaters.

250
00:13:47,635 --> 00:13:49,470
That's a three-minute break.
Three minutes.

251
00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:50,502
Let's go!

252
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,141
Hey, Dad.

253
00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:57,692
- Lookin' good, Matt.
- Thanks.

254
00:13:57,895 --> 00:13:59,502
I think I'm gonna take off.
I got some sleep to catch up on.

255
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,570
Wait, can you hold on
a minute?

256
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:03,473
I want you to meet the coach.
Hey, come here, come here.

257
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,970
This is my dad.

258
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:07,343
Coach!

259
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:08,672
Yeah.

260
00:14:08,707 --> 00:14:11,301
Uh, this is my dad,
Henry Saracen.

261
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:13,202
This is Coach Taylor.
This is my dad.

262
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:14,800
- How do you do?
- Pleasure to meet you.

263
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:15,972
Pleasure to meet you. 

264
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:17,830
You're, uh,
you're on leave?

265
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:20,100
Yeah, he's home
for two weeks.

266
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:21,602
That's good--you gonna get to
see your son play a little bit?

267
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:22,001
I hope so.

268
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:24,602
He's done a hell of a job
leadading this team, I tell you.

269
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:26,200
Not much trouble
from him, huh?

270
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:28,373
He's a little bit of trouble.
He's not too much trouble.

271
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:31,830
He's been a pleasure to teach,
I can tell you that.

272
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,941
I  didn't know
he had it in him.

273
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,473
He's got plenty in him.

274
00:14:37,505 --> 00:14:39,303
He's been a good team leader
out here.

275
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:40,573
I'll tell you what.
You can be proud of your son.

276
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:42,522
Just hope he keeps doin'
okay under pressure.

277
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:43,893
You betcha.

278
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:46,060
Well, I gotta run, Coach.
I'll talk to you later.

279
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:47,560
- It was a pleasure to meet you.
- Very nice meeting you.

280
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:48,893
I'll see you
at home, Son.

281
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:50,460
Yeah, I'll see you
at home, Dad.

282
00:14:51,588 --> 00:14:52,551
Thanks--thanks, Coach.

283
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:54,292
OK, go get some drink now

284
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,872
he's probably just
having a hard time

285
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:04,542
trying to express himself.

286
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,901
Yeah, maybe.

287
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,102
You know what it is?

288
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:09,402
He's probably all messed up
from the war.

289
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:10,801
That's exactly what it is--
he's gone war crazy

290
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,731
from the, you know, Operation
Freedom flashbacks and stuff.

291
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,803
He's not war crazy.

292
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,770
He's just--

293
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:18,202
He--he should see you play.

294
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:19,733
I mean, if you get him
to one of the games,

295
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:21,462
he'll understand
what all of the fuss is about.

296
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:24,393
Yeah. I guess.

297
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:27,971
Is he gonna help you get some
in-home care for your grandma?

298
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:30,741
Well, yeah, he's gonna
straighten all that out.

299
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:32,443
I mean, really, this
is, like, a perfect time

300
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:33,701
for him to come home

301
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:35,003
because, clearly,
I can't get it done.

302
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:36,200
You know what, Matty?

303
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:37,602
I think what he needs

304
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:40,371
is to come and see...

305
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,700
my new band,
Crucifictorious!

306
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:45,603
Anyone?
Broken Spoke.

307
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:47,771
This Friday
after the game.

308
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:49,643
Doors open at 11:00--you gotta
get there early, though.

309
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:50,943
It's gonna be pretty packed.

310
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:52,572
We have to go
to that, don't we?

311
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:53,872
Well, if we don't go,

312
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:56,140
I don't really think anyone else
is gonna be there, so--

313
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:01,972
Yep.

314
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:05,342
Hi.

315
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:06,772
Hey.

316
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:11,472
Guess what I have.

317
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:12,870
What?

318
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,800
Dirty, dirty,

319
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:17,473
dirty

320
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:19,972
quad porn.

321
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:21,170
What?

322
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,802
Before you engage

323
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:25,000
in any sexual activity
with a partner,

324
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:27,570
it will be helpful to know
how your new body works.

325
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:30,873
This can most effectively
be done by masturbation.

326
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,970
Listen, Lyla, can we just shut
this off and talk for a few--

327
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:33,773
No

328
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:36,442
I know it's not exactly
the porn you were expecting,

329
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:38,443
but there's some
useful stuff in here.

330
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:40,741
Keepin' it open mind
and using your imagination

331
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:43,401
in your wheelchair
can allow for spotting

332
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:45,301
and pleasure

333
00:16:45,348 --> 00:16:47,772
in sexual activity.
Enjoy yourself

334
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,542
I wasn't expecting
any porn.

335
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,771
No, Jason, wait!

336
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:56,240
Listen,
I know this is weird,

337
00:16:56,277 --> 00:16:57,943
but we can
get through this.

338
00:16:57,978 --> 00:16:59,541
That's not what I'm--

339
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:00,901
I think we were
really close before.

340
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:02,403
It's not about sex.

341
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:05,403
And a lot of couples
have very good luck

342
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:07,002
in the shower.

343
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:09,742
You wanna get laid
that bad, call Riggins.

344
00:17:14,678 --> 00:17:16,141
You know what?

345
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:17,941
I don't know
about you, Tim,

346
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:20,771
but I am excited
about your new journey

347
00:17:20,808 --> 00:17:23,173
into the wonderful world
of American literature.

348
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,440
I really, really am.

349
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:27,270
What do you think of the name
Crucifictorious?

350
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:29,740
I wanted to go with
Stigmatalingus,

351
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:32,203
- but I, uh, got outvoted.
- They're both crap, Landry.

352
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:33,543
I mean, that's great.

353
00:17:33,576 --> 00:17:34,873
You are entitled
to your opinion.

354
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:36,903
That's just what makes
America so great.

355
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:38,641
Just being honest.

356
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:41,272
Okay, Of Mice and Men.

357
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:43,203
The good news is it's a short
book--it's a hundred pages,

358
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,000
so you can pretty much
rock it out in one night.

359
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:46,133
Right on that.

360
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:51,571
Oh, my God,
you can't read, can you?

361
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:53,141
Is that it?

362
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:55,243
You're one of those kids who
just slipped through the cracks?

363
00:17:55,276 --> 00:17:57,400
I can read, you joke.

364
00:17:57,447 --> 00:17:59,300
I just choose not to.

365
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:01,470
That's cute.
That's real cute.

366
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:07,170
I got a show
you might wanna come to.

367
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:09,141
Still like it
almost burnt?

368
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:10,300
Yes, sir.
There you go.

369
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:11,300
Look at that.

370
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:13,070
It's good, Matthew.
Thanks.

371
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:15,373
Beats the hell out of 
them MREs.

372
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:18,773
Is that one done?

373
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,040
Oh, yeah, it's done.

374
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,570
Relax.

375
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,103
What is she so nervous for?

376
00:18:29,147 --> 00:18:31,940
She's always like this--that's
what I was trying to tell you.

377
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,403
That's why I wanna try
and get a nurse in here

378
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:35,840
or something like that.

379
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:37,401
I'm  not nervous.

380
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:38,672
I--I know.

381
00:18:38,706 --> 00:18:41,441
So, what's it, um,

382
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:44,302
wh-what's it like
over there in Iraq?

383
00:18:44,347 --> 00:18:45,942
Good.
Building schools.

384
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:47,293
Doing a lot of good.

385
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:49,572
Yeah, so when do you think
it's gonna be over?

386
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:52,140
When do you think you can
come home for--for good?

387
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:54,271
I tell you this--
we're not gonna leave

388
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:55,903
until those people
have a stable government.

389
00:18:56,377 --> 00:18:58,071
You know, uh,

390
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:01,340
there's some people
that think that we should just,

391
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:03,961
you know, get everybody
out of there and come home.

392
00:19:04,146 --> 00:19:05,500
Do you know what would
happen if we left?

393
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:07,670
How many innocent
people would die?

394
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:10,442
We're gonna stay until we finish
what we started, Matt.

395
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:13,203
Well, I'm not really saying--
I wasn't saying anything.

396
00:19:13,246 --> 00:19:16,401
I just, you know, I just
like it when you're home.

397
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:26,573
Hey, I got you.

398
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:28,400
No, I got it.
Come on, now.

399
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:29,773
I already dragged
the other one out here.

400
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:31,542
I can drag
this one out too.

401
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:33,741
You're gonna do the last 3 feet
and take all the credit for it?

402
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:35,641
I'm not gonna give you
the credit now.

403
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,870
I got the other one out--
Hey--

404
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:44,243
I can't believe
you just did that.

405
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:46,741
- I didn't do anything.
-  Look at that!

406
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:48,601
- Come on, just--
- That's a disaster.

407
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:50,371
I'll get it.
I'll get it.

408
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:51,903
Let me ask you something.

409
00:19:51,947 --> 00:19:54,042
Did you, by chance,
make it your personal mission

410
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:56,572
to take over the education
of Tim Riggins?

411
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:57,842
I am, actually, yes.

412
00:19:57,876 --> 00:19:59,441
You know, I found out

413
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:01,501
that he's been having
the Rally Girls do his homework

414
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:03,641
for I don't know how long.

415
00:20:03,678 --> 00:20:05,542
That's very nice of you,
but we're both aware of

416
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:07,640
the no pass, no play policy.

417
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:09,470
Yeah, I'm very aware
of that, mm-hmm.

418
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:10,603
And if you would
just think about this--

419
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:12,300
I know that
you're not about to say--

420
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:13,940
- It's just for the next couple games.
- What I think you're gonna say.

421
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:15,141
We got a chance
at the playoffs.

422
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:16,603
'Cause you know what
the answer is gonna be,

423
00:20:16,645 --> 00:20:18,370
because you know what--
he's been cheatin', honey.

424
00:20:18,405 --> 00:20:20,071
And I don't even want
to ask you

425
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:21,241
if you knew that
he's been cheating.

426
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:22,441
But he's been cheating,

427
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:23,970
and I know you don't want me
to turn my back on that.

428
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:25,301
No, I didn't know
he was cheating,

429
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:27,643
and I know how important
the kid's schooling is.

430
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:29,501
What I'm saying is
that the next couple of games--

431
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,502
Do you, though--you think
it's as important as winning?

432
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:32,743
I mean, really, do you?

433
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:34,240
You're really asking me
that question?

434
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:36,171
- You're asking me that question?
- Can you answer the question?

435
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:37,553
No, I can't answer
the question,

436
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:39,152
because you won't
let me finish talking.

437
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,192
Well, you know what,

438
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:41,851
it does not do Tim Riggins
a bit of good

439
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:43,890
to grow up ignorant
and mean and dumb.

440
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:45,092
What are you talking about?

441
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,221
That's what you are encouraging
with these boys.

442
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:47,421
- I'm not encouraging that.
- Yes, you are!

443
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,290
I know how important
his education is.

444
00:20:49,325 --> 00:20:50,720
No, you're making 'em
feel like

445
00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:52,153
what this town
makes 'em feel like,

446
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:54,192
which is that football
is the most important thing.

447
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:56,921
If we send that message to him,
that's what he's gonna believe.

448
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,522
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- No, I'm not.

449
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,892
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I'm not kidding you.

450
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,723
You know I'm not
kidding you.

451
00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:03,453
I can't believe that we're
even disagreeing about this.

452
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:06,023
I can't believe you're even
asking me to do that.

453
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:07,490
Hello.

454
00:21:07,497 --> 00:21:08,760
It's Coach Taylor.

455
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:09,762
Yeah.

456
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:10,931
I'll get the rest
of the garbage.

457
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:13,661
Hey, Coach.
Yes, sir.

458
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:22,233
Well, I mean, I can't make
any commitments, obviously--

459
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,492
Well, sure.

460
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,633
All right, well, I'll look
forward to your call.

461
00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:33,183
You can consider the
conversation open, of course.

462
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:35,663
All right, you too.

463
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,692
Thanks, Coach.

464
00:21:41,137 --> 00:21:42,831
What?
Who was that?

465
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:48,690
That was an assistant coach
from over at UT.

466
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:53,092
They want to know
if I had any interest

467
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:55,632
in quarterback coach
next season.

468
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:57,761
Uh-uh.

469
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:01,233
That's what the man said.

470
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,632
Nuh-uh.
Really?

471
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,762
Get outta here!

472
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:06,590
You're fooling me.
Really?

473
00:22:11,426 --> 00:22:12,531
Hey, Riggins.

474
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:15,520
Hey, Riggins,

475
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:17,290
when do you
want to get together

476
00:22:17,326 --> 00:22:18,893
and work on that
book report?

477
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:20,863
Oh, man,
I haven't read that.

478
00:22:20,897 --> 00:22:22,361
Why have you not
read it?

479
00:22:22,396 --> 00:22:24,393
I don't know.
I didn't get around to it.

480
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,463
Okay, just checking.
That's great.

481
00:22:26,496 --> 00:22:29,321
Um, you know if you don't pass,
you don't play, right?

482
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,121
What do you want me to do?

483
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:33,360
You want me to read it
to you myself?

484
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:37,292
A few miles south of Soledad,
the Salinas River

485
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:39,222
drops in close
to the hillside bank

486
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:41,391
and runs deep and green.

487
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:43,652
The water is warm, too,
for it has slipped twinkling

488
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,420
over the yellow sands
in the sunlight

489
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:47,162
before reaching
the narrow pool.

490
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:49,653
What did I just say
just now?

491
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:53,522
I don't know--some stuff
about a river.

492
00:22:53,556 --> 00:22:55,961
Okay, well, what did this
river look like?

493
00:22:55,996 --> 00:22:58,022
It's real pretty, Landry.

494
00:23:00,065 --> 00:23:01,461
Okay.

495
00:23:01,497 --> 00:23:03,553
On one side of the river--

496
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,090
What the hell is Riggins
doin' in there?

497
00:23:07,356 --> 00:23:08,893
Studying.

498
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:12,463
Hey, Dad.

499
00:23:12,496 --> 00:23:13,891
What, uh--

500
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:15,161
what are you doing?

501
00:23:15,197 --> 00:23:16,651
Your grandma's
driving me crazy.

502
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,123
I had to get out
of the house.

503
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,821
She can be a little much
sometimes.

504
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,550
Why didn't you tell me
how bad it was?

505
00:23:22,597 --> 00:23:24,551
Well, it's not that bad--

506
00:23:25,928 --> 00:23:27,092
Grandma!

507
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,192
Grandma!

508
00:23:31,195 --> 00:23:32,291
Grandma!
Huh?

509
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,462
Grandma, you all right?

510
00:23:33,498 --> 00:23:34,760
You gotta be
kidding me.

511
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:37,262
What did I tell you
about using the stove?

512
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:39,792
What is wrong with you?
You're acting like a damn child!

513
00:23:39,828 --> 00:23:41,553
Dad, calm down.
It was an accident.

514
00:23:41,598 --> 00:23:43,690
I told you three times
to lay away from the stove!

515
00:23:43,725 --> 00:23:45,163
Dad, don't yell at her.
You're just gonna scare her.

516
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:46,921
You okay?
No, no, no.

517
00:23:46,966 --> 00:23:48,020
Don't cry, it's okay.

518
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:49,462
I don't even know
what happened, honey.

519
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:50,551
Why is he mad at me?

520
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,262
He's not.
He's just scared.

521
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:53,290
All right?

522
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:55,291
We were all just scared,
all right?

523
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:56,653
What happened?

524
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:58,423
It's all right.
It's all over, okay?

525
00:23:58,465 --> 00:24:00,551
You all right?

526
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:02,762
It's not your fault,
okay?

527
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:08,651
The Medicare is not gonna
pay for at-home care

528
00:24:08,695 --> 00:24:11,062
unless she has a definitive
diagnosis of Alzheimer's.

529
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:13,891
Well, let's get her
a diagnosis, then.

530
00:24:17,728 --> 00:24:20,160
What about a home?
What?

531
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,763
My veterans' benefits
should cover that.

532
00:24:21,797 --> 00:24:23,620
Yeah, there's some
homes in the area.

533
00:24:23,658 --> 00:24:25,392
But she's Matt's
legal guardian.

534
00:24:25,427 --> 00:24:27,961
If she's in a home,
that's not gonna work.

535
00:24:29,227 --> 00:24:30,862
There's another option.

536
00:24:30,895 --> 00:24:33,821
Mr. Saracen, you might be able
to get out of your service

537
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:35,061
if there's no one else
to look--

538
00:24:35,095 --> 00:24:36,391
No, I can't do that.

539
00:24:36,427 --> 00:24:37,593
What?
Why not?

540
00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:39,121
That--
that would be perfect.

541
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:41,023
It's out of the question, Matt.
We're not done over there yet.

542
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:42,122
But, Dad, it's grandma--

543
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:44,090
I'm not gonna argue
about it with you.

544
00:24:44,127 --> 00:24:45,822
We all have to make
sacrifices.

545
00:24:45,868 --> 00:24:47,123
I know, I underst--

546
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,363
Stop, Matt.

547
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:50,393
Thank you.

548
00:24:50,427 --> 00:24:52,462
I think
we've heard enough here.

549
00:24:55,697 --> 00:24:58,091
Slim said, 'You hadda, George.
I swear you hadda.

550
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,220
Come on with me.

551
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,220
He led George to the
entrance of the trail

552
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:02,362
and up toward the highway.

553
00:25:02,397 --> 00:25:03,860
Curley and Carlson
looked after them,

554
00:25:03,895 --> 00:25:05,551
and Carlson said,

555
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:08,921
What the hell you suppose
is eatin' them two guys?'

556
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:12,660
Damn.

557
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:15,612
The guy shot
his best friend.

558
00:25:16,896 --> 00:25:18,773
Intense.

559
00:25:20,556 --> 00:25:23,722
Now he's become the kind of man
he said he never wanted to be.

560
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:24,920
Exactly.

561
00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:26,292
- I gotcha.
- Exactly.

562
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:28,261
Without Lennie, George
lost all his humanity.

563
00:25:28,297 --> 00:25:30,063
Yeah, that's messed up.

564
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:33,122
Okay, so oral report.

565
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:36,061
All right, first, you give
a brief plot summary,

566
00:25:36,096 --> 00:25:39,292
and then you list the themes
and how they relate to you.

567
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,390
So, how do they
relate to you?

568
00:25:43,898 --> 00:25:45,323
Go.

569
00:25:45,366 --> 00:25:47,553
I don't know.

570
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:49,290
You don't--

571
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:51,520
Okay, we just got done
discussing this whole thing.

572
00:25:51,556 --> 00:25:53,722
That was talking.
This is different.

573
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:56,492
How is this different?
This is the same exact thing.

574
00:25:56,528 --> 00:25:57,522
Just tell me what you--

575
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,863
Seriously, what do you
want me to say?

576
00:25:59,895 --> 00:26:02,091
You know, why don't you
just do it for me?

577
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:03,293
- Just do it for you?
- Yeah.

578
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:05,793
No, I'm not gonna
just do it for you.

579
00:26:05,828 --> 00:26:07,361
I mean--

580
00:26:08,426 --> 00:26:09,991
My God, you really
are ridiculous.

581
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,963
Do you just have the Rally
Girls do everything for you?

582
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:13,492
I mean, do they
just chew your food

583
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:16,360
and wipe your butt for you--
how does this work?

584
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:19,021
I just sat here
and read the entire--

585
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:21,092
the entire book to you,

586
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,420
and you have nothing to say.

587
00:26:22,465 --> 00:26:24,461
There's gotta be something
in this head of yours

588
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:25,422
that you can relate to.

589
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:26,620
I don't know.

590
00:26:26,655 --> 00:26:28,191
- There's gotta be something!
- I don't know.

591
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:30,461
What don't you know?
Okay, listen--listen.

592
00:26:30,498 --> 00:26:32,793
Okay, this--this is a book

593
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:34,822
about two best friends

594
00:26:34,866 --> 00:26:37,323
who have a dream
that gets crushed.

595
00:26:37,366 --> 00:26:39,690
They have a dream
that gets crushed.

596
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:42,392
You can't tell me that
there's not something

597
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:44,462
in this head of yours
that you can relate this to.

598
00:26:44,496 --> 00:26:45,993
There's gotta be something!

599
00:26:46,025 --> 00:26:47,361
My Go--

600
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:50,360
You know, here's an example
how I can relate to this.

601
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:53,153
I would really, really
like to shoot you right now.

602
00:26:54,068 --> 00:26:55,492
Okay, so you know what?

603
00:26:55,527 --> 00:26:56,760
Just take the book,
and I'm done.

604
00:26:56,797 --> 00:27:00,093
You can figure it out
on your own from here.

605
00:27:00,126 --> 00:27:03,163
God.

606
00:27:06,655 --> 00:27:08,021
- Jason.
- Hey, Mrs. Taylor.

607
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:10,160
- How are you, honey?
- I'm good, I'm good.

608
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:12,463
- Um, how are you?
- I'm good.

609
00:27:12,496 --> 00:27:14,461
Did you wheel yourself
all the way over here?

610
00:27:14,496 --> 00:27:15,590
Yeah, I did.

611
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:18,462
It's no big deal.
I do it all the time.

612
00:27:18,495 --> 00:27:20,921
Oh, my--well,
did you want to see Coach?

613
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:22,923
He's not here.
He's at a meeting.

614
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:25,462
And then we got
this church dinner.

615
00:27:25,498 --> 00:27:27,392
Um, well, you know what?
Come on inside.

616
00:27:27,427 --> 00:27:30,743
You know what?
I was just thinking about you.

617
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:33,393
I was just thinking about
when you might

618
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:36,261
feel like you're ready
to go back to school.

619
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:38,920
I, uh,

620
00:27:38,966 --> 00:27:41,320
I haven't really
thought about it yet.

621
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:44,391
Just keep in mind that you can
come back any time you want.

622
00:27:44,425 --> 00:27:46,362
I mean, you don't have to,
you know,

623
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:48,962
wait for the new semester
or anything like that.

624
00:27:48,997 --> 00:27:50,390
I know.

625
00:27:50,428 --> 00:27:51,890
You've practically
got all your courses

626
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:53,761
taken care of anyway.

627
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:56,123
You've only got
a few credits left.

628
00:27:56,168 --> 00:27:57,793
Yeah, just, I'm--

629
00:27:58,537 --> 00:28:00,521
I don't know if I'm ready
to be part of the, uh,

630
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,911
Dillon High rumor mill
right now.

631
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:06,791
I got enough to handle.

632
00:28:06,828 --> 00:28:09,761
Are you talking about
that thing with Lyla?

633
00:28:09,797 --> 00:28:12,521
I'm just so confused,
you know.

634
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,723
It's just--

635
00:28:16,397 --> 00:28:18,393
I saw Lyla the other day,

636
00:28:18,425 --> 00:28:19,791
and we just--

637
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:21,550
Don't tell Coach, please.

638
00:28:21,595 --> 00:28:23,323
Oh, no.
I won't.

639
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:25,523
And I kinda, sorta

640
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:27,893
tried to get back
together, and--

641
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,921
I want to.
I just want to, you know?

642
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:34,461
But I'm just having
such a hard time with it.

643
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:35,591
It's just--

644
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,491
It's just--it's Lyla.

645
00:28:37,526 --> 00:28:38,893
I wish it was someone else.

646
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,551
I wish it was someone
different.

647
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:42,690
I wish I could just hate her
and walk away from it

648
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:45,622
and be done with it, 'cause
it would be so much easier.

649
00:28:46,795 --> 00:28:48,123
Be a lot easier.

650
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:50,090
But I love her, you know?
And--

651
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:54,520
We were gonna get married.

652
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:55,620
Mm.

653
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:57,160
That's a hard thing.

654
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,401
It's a hard, hard thing.

655
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:04,120
But I will say

656
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:07,363
there's no weakness
in forgiveness.

657
00:29:09,656 --> 00:29:11,683
If that's what you decide.

658
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:25,710
Look what I found.

659
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:28,913
Your mom gave it to me
about a hundred years ago.

660
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:30,312
You want it?

661
00:29:30,345 --> 00:29:32,243
Sure.

662
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,343
Thanks.

663
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:42,513
Talked to your Aunt Peg
in Oklahoma,

664
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:44,451
and she said she's willing
to have you live with her.

665
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:50,542
You don't have to do that.
I can stay here.

666
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:52,973
I can take care of grandma
just like I--

667
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:54,871
just like I been doing.

668
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:56,772
Something's
gotta be done, all right?

669
00:29:56,816 --> 00:29:57,753
And I found a home
for her.

670
00:29:57,848 --> 00:29:59,491
Grandma's not even--she's--

671
00:29:59,977 --> 00:30:02,143
She won't even know
anyone there.

672
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:05,312
Matt, look,

673
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,110
I know this ain't easy.

674
00:30:07,145 --> 00:30:08,543
All right?
Let me help you with that.

675
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:09,940
It's fine.

676
00:30:09,978 --> 00:30:11,011
Let me help you.

677
00:30:11,046 --> 00:30:12,772
I'm gonna be late.
I just gotta go, okay?

678
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:17,542
Let us pray.

679
00:30:17,575 --> 00:30:20,313
Dear Lord,
our heavenly Father,

680
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:22,912
we ask that you give
these boys

681
00:30:22,945 --> 00:30:25,612
the strength
to be guided by you

682
00:30:25,647 --> 00:30:29,211
and to be vessels
for your saving message.

683
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:32,313
And to play with the passion

684
00:30:32,345 --> 00:30:35,112
that you yourself
have blessed them with.

685
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:36,041
Amen.

686
00:30:36,077 --> 00:30:37,273
Amen.

687
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:38,770
Let's have some barbecue.

688
00:30:41,446 --> 00:30:42,940
Hey.

689
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,112
Coach.

690
00:30:45,147 --> 00:30:47,241
I don't give you the impression

691
00:30:47,276 --> 00:30:50,010
that I think of you only
as a football player, do I?

692
00:30:50,045 --> 00:30:52,541
I bring this up because,
as usual,

693
00:30:52,575 --> 00:30:54,841
my wife is always right.

694
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:57,110
You got your midterms
comin' up.

695
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,472
I'm gonna be in contact
with your teachers.

696
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:01,373
I'm gonna know
what's goin' on.

697
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:03,343
There are gonna be
no more free rides.

698
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,692
You're gonna start paying.

699
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:08,712
And hear me when I say this.

700
00:31:09,877 --> 00:31:11,372
No pass...

701
00:31:12,578 --> 00:31:13,863
no play.

702
00:31:16,545 --> 00:31:18,491
So, uh,
where's your dad?

703
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,382
He's not coming.

704
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:23,652
But I thought you said
he was gonna come.

705
00:31:23,877 --> 00:31:26,641
Yeah, but he's just
not coming, okay?

706
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,511
He has something to do.

707
00:31:28,547 --> 00:31:29,572
That kinda sucks.

708
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:30,601
What does he have
that's so impor--

709
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:31,182
I don't know.

710
00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:33,192
He just has something
that's going on, okay?

711
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,161
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not.

712
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:39,373
And you picking at me's
not helping,

713
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:40,982
so could we just
not talk about it?

714
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:45,432
Yeah--yeah, Matt.
Whatever.

715
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:11,592
<i>Midway through the third quarter
Westward 24 Dillon 14</i>

716
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,891
Red 40!

717
00:32:13,938 --> 00:32:16,791
Red 40!

718
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:18,163
Red 40!
Hike!

719
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:19,932
<i>He drops back.</i>

720
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:21,333
<i>He's got Dolia!</i>

721
00:32:21,365 --> 00:32:22,760
<i>He's wide open in the flats.</i>

722
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:27,632
Come on, son.
You gotta get rid of that!

723
00:32:29,438 --> 00:32:31,263
Get up, Son, and go!
Get up.

724
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:34,333
<i>Matt Saracen is just not
on his game tonight, folks.</i>

725
00:32:38,868 --> 00:32:40,131
Hut!

726
00:32:42,235 --> 00:32:43,932
<i>It's a bad pitch.</i>

727
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:46,712
<i>Williams picks it up.</i>

728
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:49,212
<i>Oh nice stiff arm. 
He gets to the end zone!</i>

729
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,580
<i>He's got one man to beat.</i>

730
00:32:53,757 --> 00:32:57,682
<i>Smash Williams, touchdown.
Dillon Panthers.</i>

731
00:32:57,715 --> 00:33:01,052
Saracen! Come here.

732
00:33:01,086 --> 00:33:02,453
Let me tell you
something.

733
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:04,313
Let me tell you something--
Smash is out there.

734
00:33:04,355 --> 00:33:06,313
He is covering
for your ass right now.

735
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:09,152
You better screw your head on
real tight, you understand me?

736
00:33:09,186 --> 00:33:10,711
Yes, Coach.

737
00:33:14,156 --> 00:33:16,013
Come on, you heard him.
Get your head in the game, boy.

738
00:33:16,057 --> 00:33:17,780
<i>Start of the fourth quarter.</i>

739
00:33:17,815 --> 00:33:18,983
<i>Westward with the ball.</i>

740
00:33:20,186 --> 00:33:21,283
Hey!

741
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:24,051
Hey!
That's nice!

742
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,140
<i>That's gonna bring a fourth down.</i>

743
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:27,933
Dolia, Smash,
come here, come here.

744
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:29,691
We're going for the block.
We're going for the block.

745
00:33:30,335 --> 00:33:31,972
I want Kripa right.
Kripa right, you understand?

746
00:33:32,005 --> 00:33:33,671
Hey, get there.

747
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,131
<i>And Dillon gets it back.</i>

748
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:53,731
All right, let's get up
and now let's go.

749
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:54,903
Capitalize right here.

750
00:33:54,937 --> 00:33:56,700
Time to capitalize, baby.
Come on.

751
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:59,803
Hey, get on your feet
and make some noise!

752
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:01,521
Get up and make some noise!

753
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,532
Hey, listen, they press their
cornerback tight on first down.

754
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:06,170
I wanna go deep.

755
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,033
One big play wipes away
all the little mistakes.

756
00:34:08,038 --> 00:34:09,530
We walk outta here winners.
Do you understand me?

757
00:34:09,535 --> 00:34:10,880
Yes, sir.
What's the call?

758
00:34:10,886 --> 00:34:13,262
Pro gun right,
X, Y cross.

759
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:14,782
Got it? Then let it fly.

760
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:16,053
Go long, Matt.

761
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,251
Make something happen, baby,
come on!

762
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:20,582
<i>And here comes Matt Saracen
back onto the field.</i>

763
00:34:20,615 --> 00:34:22,410
<i>With Plenty of time
in the fourth quarter</i>

764
00:34:22,456 --> 00:34:24,112
<i>to get his team back into this.</i>

765
00:34:27,486 --> 00:34:29,983
Green, 12!

766
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:33,390
Hut!

767
00:34:36,645 --> 00:34:38,610
<i>Oh, and the safety's
out of position.</i>

768
00:34:39,388 --> 00:34:41,670
<i>Williams streaks up
the sideline.</i>

769
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:44,242
Matt Saracen let it fly

770
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:54,290
<i>Oh no, and Matt Saracen
just overthrew Smash Williams</i>

771
00:34:54,547 --> 00:34:55,553
<i>by a mile.</i>

772
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:58,781
<i>That could have been
an easy touchdown for Dillon.</i>

773
00:34:58,918 --> 00:34:59,893
Start warming up Weston.

774
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:02,261
Weston, let's go!
Warm it up.

775
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:03,933
Time!
Time!

776
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:07,763
Step out.

777
00:35:07,796 --> 00:35:09,291
It's not your night, son.

778
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:16,861
<i>Coach Taylor's
benched Matt Saracen</i>

779
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:22,603
<i>and is sending in second string
quarterback Brett Weston.</i>

780
00:35:23,278 --> 00:35:24,901
<i>This might be a risky move,</i>

781
00:35:24,908 --> 00:35:26,463
<i>but the way Saracen's
played tonight,</i>

782
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:29,391
<i>what does Coach Taylor
have to lose?</i>

783
00:36:08,078 --> 00:36:09,882
There you go, baby!
There you go!

784
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:14,990
There you go!

785
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:24,503
Good game, Coach.

786
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:25,930
Very good. Yes, sir!

787
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:38,832
You'll get 'em
next time, Matt.

788
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:41,170
You're sending me
to Oklahoma.

789
00:36:41,205 --> 00:36:43,132
You can play football
anywhere.

790
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:44,312
Go to hell, Dad.

791
00:36:45,476 --> 00:36:47,203
What'd you say?
I said go to hell.

792
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:49,203
Matt, just get in the truck
right now, and we'll talk--

793
00:36:49,238 --> 00:36:50,433
I'm not getting
in the truck with you,

794
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:51,731
and I'm not gonna
go home with you.

795
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:53,633
You know, I thought you were
gonna come home from Iraq

796
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:54,631
and actually be able to help,

797
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:56,173
but you've
only made things worse.

798
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,671
Do you know what?

799
00:36:57,706 --> 00:36:59,250
Actually, why don't you
just go back to Iraq?

800
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,431
'Cause things worked out a lot
better when you were there.

801
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:03,191
Really, you calling me
all the time--"Help me.

802
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:04,552
"Grandma
can't do anything right.

803
00:37:04,596 --> 00:37:06,252
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do."

804
00:37:06,297 --> 00:37:08,021
I'm sorry--it's hard to pay the
rent and go to school and take--

805
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:09,353
Try being me
for five minutes!

806
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:10,353
- Try being you?
- What have you done?

807
00:37:10,398 --> 00:37:11,890
You think I wanna
come home to this?

808
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:14,390
- Now get in the truck.
- I'm not going anywhere with you.

809
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:15,990
Get in the truck.
You get in the truck.

810
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:17,353
Where you gonna go?

811
00:37:17,398 --> 00:37:19,351
I don't know.

812
00:37:20,525 --> 00:37:22,990
Let me know
when you go back to Iraq.

813
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:29,451
Come on.

814
00:37:29,495 --> 00:37:30,820
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

815
00:38:07,755 --> 00:38:08,941
Lookee here.

816
00:38:09,556 --> 00:38:10,403
Wow.

817
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:13,532
What do you think?

818
00:38:13,568 --> 00:38:15,563
That's some
intense stuff, man.

819
00:38:15,606 --> 00:38:17,030
Very intense.

820
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:20,133
- Showed up.
- Didn't think you would.

821
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:21,902
You wanna know why?

822
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:23,062
Why?

823
00:38:24,205 --> 00:38:26,433
'Cause you're looking at a B-.

824
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:27,361
You got a B-?

825
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,763
- Not too shabby, huh?
- There you go.

826
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,063
Look at you, turning into
a scholar on me.

827
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:33,903
I appreciate your help, man.
I really do.

828
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:35,362
And,

829
00:38:35,408 --> 00:38:37,702
I'm sorry I just caught
the last bit of your, uh,

830
00:38:37,736 --> 00:38:38,803
set there, so--

831
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:40,130
No, no, no, don't worry.

832
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,562
We got a whole 'nother set
coming up, so--

833
00:38:41,608 --> 00:38:44,060
No worries, my friend,
we'll put you--

834
00:38:44,108 --> 00:38:45,432
you know, you're with me,

835
00:38:45,465 --> 00:38:47,601
so we'll put you right
up here at the front, okay?

836
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:48,732
That's great.

837
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:50,501
You can't just
stand there, though.

838
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,303
You gotta--
You gotta do that a lot.

839
00:39:11,236 --> 00:39:13,562
You're incredibly stealthy.

840
00:39:15,108 --> 00:39:17,903
- You could be like a glamorous jewel thief.
- Shut up.

841
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:20,933
You can go into breaking
and entering for a living.

842
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:28,061
What are you doing here, Lyla?

843
00:39:28,105 --> 00:39:30,502
Can't seem to kick the habit.

844
00:39:45,768 --> 00:39:47,832
If it's gonna end between us,

845
00:39:47,867 --> 00:39:51,131
I guess I can't help that.

846
00:39:51,168 --> 00:39:53,630
But...

847
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:55,762
it can't end the way
it did the other night.

848
00:40:00,736 --> 00:40:04,503
I just wanted to be close
to you again, Jason.

849
00:40:05,438 --> 00:40:07,203
I'm trying, Lyla.

850
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:10,183
I really am.

851
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:20,693
I love you.

852
00:40:23,365 --> 00:40:24,742
I know.

853
00:40:31,317 --> 00:40:32,501
Hey.

854
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:35,232
What are you doing?

855
00:40:38,795 --> 00:40:40,800
I just don't
want him to go.

856
00:40:46,156 --> 00:40:49,033
Come on.
Let's get ready for bed.

857
00:40:51,808 --> 00:40:53,440
That's it.

858
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:57,502
Grandma's going into a home,
and I'm going to Oklahoma.

859
00:40:58,418 --> 00:40:59,832
Want me to talk to him?

860
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:03,331
I'll talk to him, see if
we can work something out.

861
00:41:04,466 --> 00:41:07,063
Nothing to work out.

862
00:41:07,108 --> 00:41:09,233
Listen to me.
We're all family here.

863
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,563
I'll do anything I can for you.
You know that.

864
00:41:12,608 --> 00:41:13,763
Hell, Buddy Garrity,

865
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,062
he ain't gonna let you
cross the state line

866
00:41:16,108 --> 00:41:18,032
without finishing this season.

867
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:20,860
He'll call out the damn
national guard if he has to.

868
00:41:21,836 --> 00:41:23,532
I hate him.

869
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:26,883
I hate my dad.

870
00:41:29,168 --> 00:41:30,730
Hey, don't do that.

871
00:41:32,205 --> 00:41:34,203
Don't make that mistake.

872
00:41:36,238 --> 00:41:37,903
You think about
what you just said.

873
00:41:37,936 --> 00:41:39,120
You get ready to go,
come inside.

874
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:40,570
I'll take you home.
