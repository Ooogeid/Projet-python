1
00:00:00,-123 --> 00:00:02,088
He's a cowboy.
He's gonna do the rodeo circuit.

2
00:00:02,256 --> 00:00:04,339
- <i>Are you gonna be faithful to me?</i>
- I'm gonna try.

3
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:06,671
- What's all this?
- I'm going with you.

4
00:00:06,796 --> 00:00:07,827
Really?

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,554
Let Matt play on
wide receiver this year.

6
00:00:10,723 --> 00:00:13,265
He thinks like a QB,
you should at least give him a shot.

7
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:16,101
I'm gonna take a little trip to New York
and get a job in a sports agency

8
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,131
with my friend Grant that I met,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

9
00:00:19,256 --> 00:00:20,523
Texas forever?

10
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:22,371
Texas forever.

11
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:23,734
All right.

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,528
You're always gonna be
my best friend.

13
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:31,700
- This is perfect, right here.
- Right.

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,685
- Thank you, sir, it's all yours.
- Thank you, sir.

15
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:40,978
Thank you.

16
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:53,135
My God!

17
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,990
Guess who's paying for my truck?

18
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,835
Whatever it takes, Billy,

19
00:01:14,203 --> 00:01:17,158
you're paying for it, to get it back to
better condition than where I left it.

20
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:19,790
Three days!
I leave for three days, Billy!

21
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,496
You're a write-off, too.
Look at you!

22
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:24,669
- What I am...
- She dumped me.

23
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:28,048
- For real?
- Yeah, for real.

24
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:30,057
Mindy dumped me.

25
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:33,864
The wedding's off.

26
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,404
Sorry to hear that.

27
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:39,985
You, uh...

28
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:42,479
You wanna talk about it?

29
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,760
Sorry about your truck.

30
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:55,660
Throw it, throw it.
Good arm.

31
00:01:56,338 --> 00:01:58,259
Now that you've got that,
I've got Mr. Bear.

32
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,232
- Good morning.
- Morning.

33
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:03,726
Who put the milk away all empty?

34
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:06,837
What? Gracie is trying
to tell me something.

35
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:09,798
Gracie and Mr. Bear inform me
someone's birthday is coming up.

36
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:12,842
I don't know
whose birthday that would be.

37
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:14,944
- It certainly isn't mine.
- Yes, it is!

38
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,517
You know, I don't think
I'm gonna have my birthday this year.

39
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:19,690
I think I've decided against it.

40
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:22,128
- You what?
- Against your birthday?

41
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:23,561
Yeah, you know what?

42
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,380
It's just, I think,
better not to have it.

43
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:28,515
I feel old.

44
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:31,801
I feel like if I have a birthday,
Gracie Belle is gonna have a birthday,

45
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:34,643
and you're gonna have a birthday.
I think it's just better not to.

46
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:37,316
It'd be the best present
you can give me.

47
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:39,160
Agreed?

48
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,429
We gotta leave in 5 minutes.

49
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:46,376
All right, listen up! It's the playoffs,
gentlemen. This is where the fun begins.

50
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:49,984
For those of you who've been out here
before, you know what I'm talking about.

51
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,173
For those of you who haven't...

52
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,923
you will.

53
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:57,810
I want y'all to think back to September
when we played Arnett Mead.

54
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:00,139
I'll tell y'all something.
We were a good team back then,

55
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,212
but we are a better team now.

56
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:05,006
Y'all look at each player
around you.

57
00:03:05,131 --> 00:03:07,826
You take a close look, you think about
what you've been through this year.

58
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:11,144
You think about the good, about the bad,
you just think about that, gentlemen,

59
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,820
and then you ask yourselves
this one question:

60
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:17,115
how much are you willing to sacrifice
of yourselves out on this field?

61
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:20,785
I guarantee
the answer to that question

62
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:23,163
will determine the outcome
of this game.

63
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:28,696
Let's have a good practice,
let's go!

64
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,841
Blue, 80, set, hut!

65
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:35,301
Get off the line!

66
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:41,397
Hey, Ned, what are you doing?
Put a body on him, let's go!

67
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,058
That's my fault. I told 'em not to
touch him so he doesn't get hurt.

68
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:46,799
If he's gonna be a receiver, he's
gonna have to take some hits.

69
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:49,606
Matt, you wanna take some hits there,
or you wanna take it real easy like?

70
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:51,818
Blue, 80, set, hut!

71
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,124
Coach! Eric!

72
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:10,001
- Eric! One minute.
- Get back here!

73
00:04:10,171 --> 00:04:12,670
You're gonna want to hear this,
I promise. Hey, boys!

74
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:16,324
- Everyone should hear this.
- Guys, we didn't wanna say anything,

75
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:19,844
because we weren't sure what was
gonna happen, but we just got the call,

76
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:24,391
the TV people have picked
the Dillon Panthers to be

77
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:27,810
the High School Game of the Week.
Now, what that means is, Friday night,

78
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:30,814
you're gonna be playing
on national television, baby!

79
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:39,072
Are you ready for some football?

80
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:46,162

00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:51,209

83
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:39,323
You got an idea what this is?

84
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,387
<i>... to receive a full credit
for community service,</i>

85
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:45,430

86
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:47,724
<i>outside of Mr. Conahan's class.</i>

87
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:52,062
I'm sure y'all have probably noticed
this morning we've got some interesting

88
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:55,873
<i>visitors around the school,
and I am pleased to announce</i>

89
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:59,152
that, on behalf of Coach Taylor

91
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:06,077
is going to be
on national television.

92
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:11,581
<i>So that's real exciting news
for all of us,</i>

93
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:14,251
<i>it's gonna be a great opportunity
for the school and for Dillon,</i>

94
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:17,295
<i>and I know y'all are gonna

95
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:19,548
<i>so everybody,
each and everyone of you,</i>

96
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:21,550
get out there and make me proud.

97
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,702
<i>Have a great day, today.</i>

98
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:27,764
All right, smile, y'all.

99
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:31,768
Thanks, folks. Enjoy the rodeo.
I'll just check out the board.

100
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:36,983
- Yes! I'm riding Estop!
- Good.

101
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,424
- That's money, baby.
- Steak dinner tonight?

102
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:40,653
{\- Hey, Cash!
- }Hey, buddy.

103
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:43,449
- Might I have your autograph, please?
- Yes, you can.

104
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:45,120
Sit on up there, man.

105
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:47,117
Let my girl get a good look at you.

106
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,914
- Hey, I saw you ride at Nashville.
- I appreciate your support.

107
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,538
All right, enjoy the rodeo.

108
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,302
- Thanks, Cash.
- No problem, buddy, see ya.

109
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,859
- That was me a long time ago.
- I'm sure it was.

110
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:00,505
Hey, Cash!
Come over here.

111
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:03,342
This is Brooke, right here.
Hey, Brooke, how you been?

112
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:06,047
- Who's this pretty girl?
- This is my girlfriend, Tyra.

113
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,555
Hi, Tyra. What are you doing
without boots and a hat?

114
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,266
Well, <i>real</i> boots and a hat.
Come over here.

115
00:07:11,626 --> 00:07:14,227
You guys have some fun girl time,
I'll see you in a bit. 

116
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:16,933
You go do your thing,
I've got her under control. 

117
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:19,316
OK, let's get you a hat.
Come over here.

118
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:22,003
So, how long have you two
been going out?

119
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:24,988
- A while, I guess.
- Well, you're a very lucky girl

120
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,784
'cause he is quite a catch.

121
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:31,370
So, what do you do?
Barrel racing, roping?

122
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,873
I'm a waitress, actually.

123
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:37,650
Good for you.
All right, so...

124
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:39,102
What do you think?

125
00:07:40,222 --> 00:07:41,884
I love it, but...

126
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:43,590
I can't afford any of this stuff.

127
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:46,009
We'll lie them on Cash.

128
00:07:46,313 --> 00:07:49,262
The money I win from this,
I will pay you, calm down.

129
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:52,308
- Does your mom still pack your lunch?
- No. How're your steak fingers?

130
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:53,642
So where is Tyra?

131
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,479
I don't know,
am I supposed to know where Tyra is?

132
00:07:57,648 --> 00:08:00,013
She's been missing for a week,
I need to talk to her.

133
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:02,412
Well, if you want,
you could probably give her a call,

134
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:05,666
- I'm sure she'd love to hear from you.
- She picked a bad week to be ditching.

135
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,156
Winter formal is in 3 weeks
and we don't have a theme.

136
00:08:09,078 --> 00:08:11,828
What are y'all gonna do...
without a theme?

137
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:15,414
She's president of the student council
and she keeps blowing off our meetings.

138
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,923
If you talk to her,
tell her to give me a call.

139
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:19,960
Otherwise, we're gonna pick
a theme without her.

140
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:22,470
You don't wanna do that.

141
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:28,468
They're gonna pick
a theme without her.

142
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:32,991
Have you seen Tyra? I mean, she has
been gone for a while, it seems like.

143
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:35,559
I think she said her aunt was sick.

144
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:42,149
Well, I'm sure that
she's fine wherever she is...

145
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:43,686
you know.

146
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,651
- He has a girlfriend, now?
- Mental note!

147
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:51,188
- Tim!
- Yeah.

148
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:52,514
Mr. Riggins.

149
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:55,333
- Scotty Simms, San Antonio State.
- How you doing?

150
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,178
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

151
00:08:57,714 --> 00:09:00,059
I'm the one who's been sending
those recruiting letters.

152
00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:01,686
You're a hard man to track down.

153
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:04,097
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I meant to call you.

154
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:06,548
We've been, like, there's practice
and State coming...

155
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:09,885
Don't worry about it, I know
what it's like, you got a lot going on.

156
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:12,720
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- I'm Lyla.

157
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,263
{\- Sorry. Lyla, Scotty Simms.
- }Nice to meet you.

158
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,539
So, listen, I don't mean
to blindside you like this,

159
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:20,270
but like I said in my letters, we're
graduating our entire backfield in June.

160
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:24,024
We really feel like you'd be
a great fit for our team next year.

161
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,485
- Thank you.
- I'll be at the Marriott next few days.

162
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:30,030
Come by tomorrow night. We'll have
a sit-down, talk about our program?

163
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:33,307
- Tomorrow night isn't a good...
- They make a hell of a rib eye.

164
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:36,449
Tomorrow night's not really good, sir.
My truck's in the shop, right now...

165
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:38,497
I'll give you a ride.
I'll give him a ride.

166
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:41,204
Great.
Eight o'clock?

167
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:43,085
Yeah, sounds good.

168
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:44,479
{\- All right, see you then.
- }See you then.

169
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:46,783
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

170
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:49,808
Scotty Simms...

171
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:03,452
Hey, Jen.
Can I see Jules for a second, please?

172
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:05,982
Come here.

173
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:07,484
Thanks.

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,559
If l could just be a second...
Come on, hurry up.

175
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:13,632
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

176
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:15,936
Listen,

177
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:18,762
Friday night, all right,
after the game...

178
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,706
I've set up a reservation at a hotel
for your mother and I.

179
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,013
It's a little surprise for her,
all right?

180
00:10:24,138 --> 00:10:27,379
I'm gonna get some champagne, flowers,
chocolate, so we can spend some time...

181
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:30,006
- I don't wanna hear about it.
- Here's what I need from you.

182
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:33,768
While mom's not looking, set up
an overnight bag for her, all right?

183
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:36,304
The other thing is, I need
for you to look after Gracie.

184
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:38,844
- Can you do that?
- I can set up the bag and watch Gracie,

185
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:42,095
but dad, I'm pretty sure mom didn't want
her birthday being celebrated at all.

186
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,669
That's her problem.

187
00:10:43,898 --> 00:10:46,468
- You're good with Gracie?
- I'm good with Gracie.

188
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:47,844
Thanks, thanks.

189
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:50,658
- Get back to your Shakespeare.
- Dad, it's math class.

190
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,963
- Tell Mr. Newton I say hello.
- Dad, Mr. Newton's not...

191
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:04,827
Yeah, baby!

192
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:06,627
Go, Cash!

193
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:20,279
That's it, baby, that's it!

194
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,812
<i>7-9, 79!
Cash Waller takes second place!</i>

195
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:36,739
- Baby, that was so good.
- Stow that, all right, honey?

196
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:40,643
Second place is the first loser.
That's not good enough at all!

197
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:55,759
- You should eat that in the kitchen.
- I'm sorry.

198
00:11:57,045 --> 00:11:59,336
- I was too tired to get a plate.
- I'll get you one.

199
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:02,098
This is my house and Matthew can eat
wherever he wants to.

200
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:04,893
Grandma, that's OK.
I should probably eat in there anyway.

201
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:08,186
- You can eat wherever you want to.
- Maybe I should use a plate.

202
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,439
This is just dirty.

203
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:11,735
- Here's a plate.
- Thank you.

204
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,173
And when are you leaving?

205
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:16,619
- Excuse me?
- I mean it.

206
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:18,823
How much longer is she planning
on being around here?

207
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:25,455
Well, since you brought it up...
I think it's OK, we should discuss it.

208
00:12:25,971 --> 00:12:28,625
- What?
- Matthew might go to college next year.

209
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:31,461
And I think that's so great,
and I told him that

210
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,593
if he did get into college,
that I could help

211
00:12:33,718 --> 00:12:36,258
take care of you, and I'd probably
be staying here a lot longer, then.

212
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:40,178
Maybe, just maybe.

213
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:42,514
You two...

214
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:46,136
have been talking about me,
in my house...

215
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:47,454
No, not like...

216
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:48,657
Haven't you?

217
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:53,400
Well, you know what?
That's just about the worst idea

218
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,445
- I ever heard and I'm not having it.
- Lorraine, calm down.

219
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:59,322
I'm not gonna calm down, missy.
Not at all.

220
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:02,150
Matthew is not going anywhere,
he wouldn't do that.

221
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:05,328
I think that's a little bit selfish,
you know,

222
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:07,964
after everything
that Matthew's done for you...

223
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,764
Me? Selfish?
We wanna talk about who's selfish?

224
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:14,104
You can't expect him
to stay here forever.

225
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:17,090
- He's a kid with a whole life to live.
- You know what? You're the devil.

226
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:19,368
No, no... Really.

227
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:21,845
The first day I met her, I knew.

228
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,803
She ruined your daddy.

229
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,795
That's a horrible thing to say.

230
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,310
She would have ruined you
if I hadn't been here!

231
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,192
- That's enough.
- No! Get away from me, both of you!

232
00:13:31,317 --> 00:13:33,857
Now, let me tell you something
right now.

233
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:36,317
You can get rid of me,
but don't leave me with her.

234
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,323
You promise me,

235
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:42,172
if you really want to, get rid of me,
but don't leave me with her.

236
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,232
You can't listen to her
when she talks like this.

237
00:13:50,357 --> 00:13:53,415
She doesn't... even know
what she's talking about.

238
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:08,569
So the angle that I'm gonna go for

239
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:10,935
is that it's really
about climate change.

240
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:13,313
Am I boring you?

241
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:16,232
It's my shoulder, it's killing me,
so I just kinda...

242
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:18,943
It's from getting hit all the time
at practice?

243
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,214
I kinda hope we lose on Friday
so your daddy gets off my back and

244
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:25,200
- stops having everyone beat up on me.
- You know what he's doing, right?

245
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,982
- Being a jerk?
- No.

246
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:29,560
He's trying to motivate you.
It's like basic psychology.

247
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:31,706
- He probably read it in a book.
- It's not working.

248
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:34,711
Hey, Matt, you're not gonna believe
what just happened to me.

249
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:36,991
Some lady just asked me

250
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:40,965
to do an interview for her tomorrow.
I guess she's some sort of

251
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:42,801
- producer or director.
- For what?

252
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:45,862
For the profile on the Panthers team,
the pre-game stuff.

253
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:48,369
Apparently, I'm gonna speak
as a scholar-athlete.

254
00:14:48,494 --> 00:14:50,850
- You're a scholar-athlete?
- I never thought about it, but...

255
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,648
- They want to interview <i>you</i>?
- I gotta go rehearse

256
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:56,123
or figure out
what I'm gonna talk about,

257
00:14:56,644 --> 00:14:59,359
- you know? Ain't that cool, Matt?
- Yeah.

258
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:03,810
I gotta get to class.

259
00:15:12,935 --> 00:15:15,358
I was gonna name
my first-born after you.

260
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:18,379
I was gonna name it Timmy.
Seriously, man, even if it was...

261
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,590
a girl.

262
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:21,344
I mean that.

263
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:23,333
That's sweet of you.

264
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:25,635
- Cheers.
- Cheers, no regrets.

265
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:26,845
No regrets.

266
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:31,183
- That one hurt.
- Didn't sit right.

267
00:15:31,704 --> 00:15:33,601
Beer me right now.
Beer it.

268
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:41,025
I've been honking
and screaming outside

269
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:43,820
- for about 5 minutes.
- Sorry, I lost track of time.

270
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,447
Just been...
tending to Billy and his broken heart.

271
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,074
- I'm ready.
- You want a drink?

272
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:52,845
You have an appointment
in about 15 minutes.

273
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:55,290
You know, when you talk
close to me like that,

274
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:57,834
we should just go have a shower.

275
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:00,335
You have an appointment in 15 minutes.
This is important.

276
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,338
- I'm ready.
- I can't believe you're drinking.

277
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:05,133
I'm not drinking.
I had a shot and half a beer.

278
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:08,391
Riggins is in his game face.
Putting my game face on.

279
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:10,972
I'm serious.
I'm good.

280
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:14,612
- I'll be in the car.
- I was gonna tell him, you know,

281
00:16:14,737 --> 00:16:16,728
"you need to get ready
'cause you got your meeting"

282
00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:19,226
- and everything, but...
- Well done, Billy.

283
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:22,484
He's gonna do fine.
I mean, it's gonna be awesome.

284
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,166
- So you knew about the meeting?
- I forgot, but...

285
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,764
- You forgot?
- I knew.

286
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:27,931
You knew...

287
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:30,199
You're a mess.

288
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:33,912
Sorry about Mindy, too, by the way.

289
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:40,722
A few things are
that it was founded in 1917

290
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:45,673
and their big thing is
small classroom sizes,

291
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:48,459
- and student-faculty ratio...
- You're absolutely right, but I...

292
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:52,096
I  think he's just gonna want to talk
about football. That's probably just it.

293
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,297
- But it doesn't...
- Keep it simple, you know?

294
00:16:54,422 --> 00:16:56,517
hurt to be informed
about the school, so that maybe...

295
00:16:57,013 --> 00:17:00,067
Well, yeah, I just...
It's not really a job interview, so...

296
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:03,162
Actually, that's exactly what it is.

297
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,557
- I know what you're doing.
- What am I doing?

298
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:12,589
With avoiding all the meetings,
and the drinking with your brother...

299
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,837
- You're afraid.
- Afraid?

300
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:18,081
You're afraid that, you know,
if it doesn't work out

301
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:20,889
for some reason,
that you'll feel like a failure, but...

302
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:25,041
To be honest with you, what I'm really
afraid of is that if it does work out,

303
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,968
then I have to go to college.

304
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:29,092
You have a shot at being
the only Riggins

305
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,845
to go to college.
That's huge!

306
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:35,181
What are you laughing at?
At me?

307
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:38,273
OK, kinda, sorta.
Because these meetings are crap.

308
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:42,605
They get you alone, they hot-box you,
fill you up with empty promises,

309
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:44,774
and that's about it,
it's a waste of time.

310
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:46,664
- Waste of time?
- I can't wait.

311
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,753
I'm excited for my free steak.

312
00:17:49,241 --> 00:17:51,239
- I have nothing to be scared of.
- I'm an idiot.

313
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:54,650
No, I am! I'm an idiot

314
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:56,744
because I thought
that you actually cared

315
00:17:56,914 --> 00:17:58,505
and you don't care about any of it.

316
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,947
You don't care about the meeting,
or about your future. None of it!

317
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:04,215
I'm trying to do some research
before my big meeting.

318
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,649
Get out of my car.

319
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,153
- Seriously?
- This is not a joke.

320
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:11,628
Get out of my car.
Out...

321
00:18:12,564 --> 00:18:13,564
of my car.

322
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,201
I don't appreciate being laughed at.
I was just trying to help.

323
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:19,517
Get out of my car.

324
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:21,670
OK, but...

325
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,842
- I don't have my coat.
- Get out of my car, Tim!

326
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:27,692
- So if I get a cold... 
- You're drunk, so you'll be warm.

327
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:30,153
I got the playoffs.
I might get sick!

328
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:32,262
Shut the door!

329
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,939
You actually gonna leave?

330
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:40,836
For real?

331
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,022
OK, seriously, it's cold.

332
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:50,965
I don't understand.
You're still going to Houston...

333
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,666
Houston's in three weeks.
Screw Houston.

334
00:18:55,745 --> 00:18:56,857
OK, you know what?

335
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:58,745
We need to get out
of this hotel room.

336
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,927
Let's go get something to eat,
I'm starving.

337
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,481
We're not going to get
something to eat.

338
00:19:05,182 --> 00:19:07,482
- You're acting like a little baby!
- I'm acting like a baby?

339
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:10,526
- Yes, 2 grand is a lot of money!
- Two grand's not enough money!

340
00:19:12,304 --> 00:19:13,696
Look, I'm sorry, but...

341
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:16,284
you know that guy I was getting
heated with the other day?

342
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:18,062
That's 'cause I owe him
a lot of money.

343
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:21,347
And if I don't pay him back, guess
what's gonna happen. Can you guess?

344
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:22,924
Can you fathom all that?

345
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:24,689
Thank you.

346
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:30,213
- How much money?
- A lot more than 2 grand, all right?

347
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:34,008
This isn't high school.
This is the real world, Tyra!

348
00:19:34,364 --> 00:19:36,678
- How dare you talk to me like that!
- What am I gonna say?

349
00:19:36,848 --> 00:19:40,611
You want me to sugarcoat this?
'Cause this is what's really happening!

350
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:43,067
You know what?

351
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:45,464
Don't worry about it,
I'll figure it out...

352
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:47,746
- Where're you going?
- I'm gonna get some fresh air.

353
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:48,882
Dammit!

354
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:51,235
Should I turn my chair?
Is this gonna be...

355
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,022
No, you just look at me. OK,
associate editor of the school paper,

356
00:19:54,147 --> 00:19:57,615
volunteer tutor, and you're also
in the Physics Club, right?

357
00:19:58,621 --> 00:19:59,951
Technically, not anymore,

358
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:02,532
'cause there was only two of us,
me and one other person.

359
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:05,142
- But I did start the Physics Club.
- All right, great, great!

360
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:07,708
- What's your GPA?
- It's actually a 4.6,

361
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,916
but are we gonna talk
about football, 'cause I'm on...

362
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,087
Oh yeah, but this is good stuff,

363
00:20:12,323 --> 00:20:14,765
this whole student athlete angle
is very inspiring.

364
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,801
Sorry, can I take this for one second?
Hello?

365
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:18,719
- It'll be just one second.
- Sure.

366
00:20:19,596 --> 00:20:20,877
It's... It's me.

367
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:25,685
What are you doing?

368
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:30,815
I'm just getting ready to do
this interview... thing, here.

369
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,984
Really? You're gonna do an interview?


370
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:39,407
They're doing this thing for the
Panthers, so they asked me to do it.

371
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,088
<i>So that's what I'm doing.</i>

372
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:43,744
<i>What are you doing?
Where are you at?</i>

373
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,101
Well...

374
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:47,661
I'm actually in Dallas.

375
00:20:51,074 --> 00:20:53,392
<i>Cash had a rodeo,
so I came with him.</i>

376
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:55,848
It's, um...

377
00:20:57,699 --> 00:20:59,149
It's raining, here.

378
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:02,254
- <i>Is everything all right or...</i>
- Yeah!

379
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:04,515
Everything's fine.
I just...

380
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:09,854
- I wanted to hear a familiar voice.
- <i>You know,</i>

381
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:13,024
April Keegan is
frantically searching for you.

382
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:17,232
<i>She wants to get a theme
straightened out for the dance,</i>

383
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:18,905
<i>she keeps bugging me about it,</i>

384
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:21,824
- so it'd be nice if you talked to her.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

385
00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:25,388
I know. I'll get on that,
I'll call her.

386
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:27,830
It'll be my next priority.

387
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,665
- 'Cause I know...
- Mr. Clarke?

388
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:32,573
<i>Can I get one more second? I'll be
right over. We're about to start?</i>

389
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:35,129
- Do you need to go?
- It's OK. I think it's fine.

390
00:21:35,803 --> 00:21:38,257
I don't want you to miss
your big interview. You should go.

391
00:21:39,155 --> 00:21:40,155
You sure?

392
00:21:40,594 --> 00:21:43,262
I'm fine. Everything's fine.
I just, you know...

393
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:45,779
Break a leg!

394
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:47,845
All right, bye.

395
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,742
What up, Garrity?

396
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,538
Hey, Mindy.

397
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:19,858
I heard about you and Billy.

398
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:21,964
I'm sorry.

399
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:25,809
What happened?

400
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,968
He's a dumbass,
that's what happened.

401
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:31,185
- Right.
- Wanted me to quit working.

402
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,312
Really?

403
00:22:33,596 --> 00:22:36,139
And I'm like, all right, genius,
so you're gonna support us now?

404
00:22:36,264 --> 00:22:38,928
That boy hasn't held a job for more
than a month since I've known him.

405
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:41,184
Yeah, well, they're both idiots.

406
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:45,241
Big plan in the future for them is like,
what kind of beer they want on Sunday.

407
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,770
- Trouble in paradise with Wonderboy?
- Yeah, we're in a fight.

408
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:51,320
We're in a fight, because...

409
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:54,869
he had this recruiter interested in him,
he kept blowing him off and just...

410
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:56,959
He's just... being typical Riggins.

411
00:22:57,774 --> 00:23:00,066
- So you're not going to the game?
- No.

412
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:01,484
No game.

413
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:07,805
Feel like hanging out?

414
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,246
<i>Tonight, only one team survives.</i>

415
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:20,277
<i>It's win, or go home.</i>

416
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:23,279
<i>With four victories needed
to reach the ultimate dream,</i>

417
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:25,907
<i>the Texas state football title.</i>

418
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,951
<i>It's the SHSC High School
Football Game of the Week,</i>

419
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:33,205
<i>and tonight, the Dillon Panthers
host the Arnett Mead Tigers.</i>

420
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,348
<i>It appears the glare
of this national spotlight</i>

421
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:53,559
<i>has these Dillon receivers
dazed and confused.</i>

422
00:23:57,693 --> 00:23:59,857
<i>Incomplete on a busted route,</i>

423
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:02,485
<i>and the Panthers are forced to punt.</i>

424
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:06,310
<i>Todd Jenkins is really struggling
with this spread offense tonight, folks.</i>

425
00:24:06,435 --> 00:24:08,325
<i>Arnett Mead over the ball...</i>

426
00:24:10,163 --> 00:24:13,060
<i>Inside hand-off,
he cuts to the outside, he's got a lane!</i>

427
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,374
<i>He's got a cut in, touchdown!
Reservation for six,</i>

428
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:18,877
<i>Arnett Mead, touchdown.</i>

429
00:24:19,964 --> 00:24:21,379
Let's go now, let's go!

430
00:24:21,985 --> 00:24:23,835
<i>Panthers back on offense.</i>

431
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,718
<i>J.D. McCoy takes the snap,
he steps back...</i>

432
00:24:28,006 --> 00:24:30,764
<i>he's got Bird
on the dig route, fires...</i>

433
00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:32,904
<i>Oh, my!</i>

434
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:36,561
- What the hell is he doing?
- What are you doing? Get over here!

435
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,254
Get outta there!

436
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:40,207
Get him outta there,
give Riggins the ball!

437
00:24:40,332 --> 00:24:43,193
- Run the damn ball!
- How many times did you run this play?

438
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:46,863
Just step around, just clear.
All you gotta do is clear!

439
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:49,475
<i>McCoy opens right.
It's a drive to Riggins,</i>

440
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,701
<i>cuts through the hole,
he's got a lane!</i>

441
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:53,986
<i>Panthers down inside the 30.</i>

442
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:55,780
<i>McCoy on the pitch,</i>

443
00:24:56,002 --> 00:24:58,208
<i>it's Riggins going wide right,
powers through...</i>

444
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:02,153
<i>Down he goes, and Riggins
has the Panthers in the red zone.</i>

445
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:03,296
Take it.

446
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:08,009
<i>It's up, and it's right through
the middle, folks.</i>

447
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:11,743
<i>That makes the score
7 to 3, Arnett Mead, at the half.</i>

448
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:15,509
<i>And thank goodness for Tim Riggins,
because the Panther aerial attack</i>

449
00:25:15,634 --> 00:25:17,602
<i>has been completely MIA tonight.</i>

450
00:25:17,953 --> 00:25:20,271
You're blowing your cover,
letting them get all over you,

451
00:25:20,441 --> 00:25:22,857
you're like this. Just sweep off,
that's all you had to do!

452
00:25:23,027 --> 00:25:25,593
We do that block, defense will bunch up,
we'll shut down, OK?

453
00:25:25,718 --> 00:25:28,661
You understand?
All right, we go no huddle?

454
00:25:28,786 --> 00:25:30,836
... mistakes, you understand?
We're losing right now!

455
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:32,601
Listen up, listen up!

456
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,498
Two minutes till we go out.

457
00:25:42,423 --> 00:25:44,089
Y'all wanna end this season?

458
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:46,925
Pack your bags, just go home,
you know where the door is.

459
00:25:48,742 --> 00:25:52,095
Otherwise, I suggest you wake up
and get your heads in this game.

460
00:25:53,925 --> 00:25:56,307
This defense is not gonna carry
this team all night long.

461
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:58,643
The offense has got to execute.

462
00:25:59,896 --> 00:26:01,469
Or else, I guarantee you...

463
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:04,441
our season ends tonight.
Understood?

464
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:06,309
- Yes, sir.
- I can't hear you.

465
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:07,694
Yes, sir!

466
00:26:08,865 --> 00:26:11,049
Let's go show me something then!

467
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:16,703
Matt! Come here!

468
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:26,295
<i>And here come the Panthers,
and this is interesting...</i>

469
00:26:26,592 --> 00:26:28,950
<i>Looks like backup quarterback
Matt Saracen</i>

470
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:31,051
<i>is in the game at wide receiver.</i>

471
00:26:31,176 --> 00:26:33,510
<i>Now we talked about this
in the open votes. Maybe...</i>

472
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:38,433
- Are you seeing this?
- Oh yes, there's Matt, look at him!

473
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,560
It is! We gotta go!

474
00:26:41,305 --> 00:26:42,687
I'm gonna get my coat.

475
00:26:42,857 --> 00:26:45,405
- Can you get that blanket?
- Yeah. This is so great!

476
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,401
- He didn't think he was gonna play.
- You know what? Tickets.

477
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:51,121
Doesn't matter. Jerry's in my
Sunday school class, he'll let us in.

478
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:54,073
- We have no problem for the tickets.
- Get your coat on right now!

479
00:26:54,552 --> 00:26:56,801
Wait a minute! I can handle it.

480
00:26:56,926 --> 00:26:58,397
- Heavens to Betsie!
- I know...

481
00:26:58,522 --> 00:27:01,039
I can do this myself.
Let's go.

482
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:02,874
Come on!

483
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:07,147
Here we go!
7, up!

484
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,004
Go, Saracen!

485
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:12,008
<i>Third quarter,
Panthers with the ball.</i>

486
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:14,552
<i>McCoy steps back,</i>

487
00:27:15,431 --> 00:27:18,431
<i>he fires across the middle, he's got...
Saracen has the ball!</i>

488
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,617
<i>Big hit!</i>

489
00:27:21,062 --> 00:27:23,436
<i>Oh, he held on!
That boy held on</i>

490
00:27:23,606 --> 00:27:25,939
<i>like he was holding on to his mama!
First down, Panthers.</i>

491
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:29,198
<i>McCoy back to pass,
he's looking deep.</i>

492
00:27:29,323 --> 00:27:31,110
<i>No, it's a shovel pass to Riggins!</i>

493
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,863
<i>He's got some open field,
one man to beat!</i>

494
00:27:34,341 --> 00:27:36,198
<i>Saracen makes a huge block!</i>

495
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:38,186
<i>Touchdown, Panthers!</i>

496
00:27:38,636 --> 00:27:40,829
<i>The Panthers are scoring here
in the second half</i>

497
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:44,124
<i>and Matt Saracen is making
the difference out there, folks.</i>

498
00:27:46,606 --> 00:27:50,004
<i>We're late in the 4th quarter,
time is running out for Arnett Mead.</i>

499
00:27:50,478 --> 00:27:54,055
<i>The Panthers have to get a first down
and this game is in the bag.</i>

500
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:57,803
<i>It's a hand-off to Riggins
up the middle.</i>

501
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:59,590
<i>Chris Cagen makes the stop.</i>

502
00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:02,961
<i>And that's gonna bring up
fourth down and a long seven</i>

503
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:05,521
<i>as Arnett Mead
calls its last time-out.</i>

504
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:08,898
Coach, let's just punt it, we're way out
of field-goal range. Good job, good try.

505
00:28:09,763 --> 00:28:11,025
<i>It's decision time</i>

506
00:28:11,195 --> 00:28:14,189
<i>for Coach Taylor and these Panthers.
They have to get this first down,</i>

507
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:18,047
<i>or Arnett Mead will get the ball back
in great field position.</i>

508
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,786
Coach Olep, let's go for it.
Let's go.

509
00:28:22,148 --> 00:28:24,998
- Coach, that's quite risky!
- Let's go for it.

510
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:28,293
- Side right, 44, fire.
- Side right, 44, fire?

511
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:30,169
That's you, 7!

512
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:33,233
- Side right, 44, fire.
- All right, you heard him, let's go!

513
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:35,170
You catch and we're done!

514
00:28:35,863 --> 00:28:37,087
<i>And here we go!</i>

515
00:28:37,212 --> 00:28:40,722
<i>It is white-knuckle time
as Dillon is going for it, fourth down</i>

516
00:28:40,892 --> 00:28:43,146
<i>and the game
hanging in the balance.</i>

517
00:28:45,997 --> 00:28:47,912
<i>Saracen has the ball.</i>

518
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,565
<i>He shakes the tackler,
stays on his feet!</i>

519
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:54,090
<i>He stretches out!
I don't know if he made it, folks!</i>

520
00:28:54,215 --> 00:28:55,841
<i>He might be short!</i>

521
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:04,329
<i>First down!
Panthers have it, folks!</i>

522
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:06,902
<i>They will not have
to run another play.</i>

523
00:29:07,027 --> 00:29:09,500
<i>Panthers win, Panthers win!</i>

524
00:29:12,837 --> 00:29:14,961
It was the right call.
Good call.

525
00:29:16,052 --> 00:29:17,543
There you go, baby.

526
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:19,928
There you go.

527
00:29:34,412 --> 00:29:36,446
I didn't know ya'll were coming.

528
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:40,698
- You were so great, I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

529
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:42,659
- When did y'all get here?
- A long time ago.

530
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:44,565
You guys came together?

531
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:57,822
Count five, Queen bets, round.

532
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,282
Last card, gentlemen.
Pair of tens.

533
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:02,664
All right, call.

534
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,431
- Aces win.
- I'm busted, damn.

535
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,141
Look, I need more.

536
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:09,352
- You're into us kind of deep...
- Gimme more!

537
00:30:09,522 --> 00:30:11,354
- You know I'm good for it.
- I can't do it.

538
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:13,731
Really?
This is how it's gonna be.

539
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,360
Afraid so.

540
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,067
The hell with you all!

541
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:20,611
- I'll get some cash and I'll be back.
- You get some cash, come on back.

542
00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:24,283
- Are we going?
- No. Sit down! I didn't say, "get up."

543
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,876
Sit down in that chair
and I'll be back.

544
00:31:11,124 --> 00:31:13,552
Why are we rushing out so fast?

545
00:31:14,217 --> 00:31:16,294
They wanna interview you in there.

546
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:18,864
- What are you up to?
- Just get in the car...

547
00:31:18,989 --> 00:31:21,883
- You're very sneaky.
- You're being very suspicious.

548
00:31:22,908 --> 00:31:24,587
If you're not taking me
to the party,

549
00:31:24,712 --> 00:31:27,735
that would be the best birthday present
I could ever ask for.

550
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,412
- Get in the car.
- OK.

551
00:31:29,537 --> 00:31:32,643
- That, and a clicker for the lock.
- You think a clicker is a good thing?

552
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,094
I don't want you to weasel booze,
this time. Bring your own, you know?

553
00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:38,775
- Can we go get something first?
- We're not getting food right now.

554
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,015
- Tim!
- It doesn't matter, I was just saying.

555
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,791
- Congratulations.
- How're you doing?

556
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,781
- You played a heck of a game.
- Thank you.

557
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,901
- They kept it pretty interesting.
- Yeah, they did.

558
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:51,254
Look, about last night,
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

559
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:53,658
- Something just...
- Don't even worry about it.

560
00:31:53,783 --> 00:31:55,062
Here's the deal.

561
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:57,502
Coach Powers called me
about you again today.

562
00:31:57,924 --> 00:32:00,622
He said you are
number one priority right now.

563
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:03,752
- Really?
- Yeah, quote unquote.

564
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:08,554
How about you let me buy you a quick pop
and you keep me from losing my job?

565
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:17,688
I love that. You are...
I love you, honey. Look at...

566
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:19,774
Thank you.
Look at this beautiful...

567
00:32:19,944 --> 00:32:22,151
Everything with the rose petals...

568
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:23,483
Honey, look!

569
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,028
Hotel robes.

570
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,657
- Something to steal!
- I love it.

571
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:29,205
We can steal 'em.

572
00:32:30,028 --> 00:32:31,127
How exciting.

573
00:32:31,442 --> 00:32:32,501
Thank you.

574
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:35,946
Happy birthday.

575
00:32:39,445 --> 00:32:42,865
This is the only birthday party
I could have ever wanted.

576
00:32:47,544 --> 00:32:49,557
Maybe we should take a shower,

577
00:32:49,682 --> 00:32:51,509
wash some of that game dirt off...

578
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:53,346
put the robes on...

579
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:03,271
Hold on, let me just get that
in case it's Jules.

580
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:05,197
Or Tyra.

581
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:08,382
I don't know, I better...
I just...

582
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:11,093
- Mrs. Taylor?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

583
00:33:11,218 --> 00:33:12,966
- It's Tyra.
- <i>Hey, Tyra.</i>

584
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:14,287
<i>What's going on?</i>

585
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:17,002
I'm sorry to bother you so late,

586
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:18,459
but, um...

587
00:33:20,474 --> 00:33:22,295
I'm in a little bit of trouble.

588
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:24,046
What's going on?
What's the matter?

589
00:33:24,216 --> 00:33:27,423
- Please don't be mad, but...
- <i>I won't be mad. What's happening?</i>

590
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:30,466
- I'm in Dallas right now.
- What are you doing there?

591
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:32,749
I came here with Cash,
but now he's gone.

592
00:33:32,874 --> 00:33:35,499
I don't know where he's at,
and I don't have any money.

593
00:33:35,624 --> 00:33:37,848
<i>And my mama's out of town,
and I can't get ahold of Mindy,</i>

594
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:40,617
- <i>and I didn't know who else to call...</i>
- I don't like that look.

595
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:42,890
OK. Well, you know what?
Listen.

596
00:33:43,213 --> 00:33:44,484
What do you need from me?

597
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:47,320
Sorry, can you come and pick me up?

598
00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:50,209
Yeah, I mean...

599
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,285
Yeah, hon. Where are you right now?
Are you some place safe?

600
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,626
I'm at the Econo Lodge

601
00:33:57,944 --> 00:33:59,373
at LBJ and Central.

602
00:33:59,543 --> 00:34:01,334
Can you stay there?
Can you lock the door?

603
00:34:01,504 --> 00:34:04,045
- Yes, ma'am.
- <i>All right. You just stay put, OK?</i>

604
00:34:04,215 --> 00:34:06,047
We'll jump in the car
and come get you.

605
00:34:06,431 --> 00:34:09,133
<i>And you just stay there,
and keep your cell phone right by you</i>

606
00:34:09,303 --> 00:34:10,968
'cause I'll need to call you, OK?

607
00:34:11,323 --> 00:34:13,367
OK. I'm so sorry.
Thank you.

608
00:34:13,492 --> 00:34:16,143
<i>You just stay tight. Don't move,
all right? I'll see you soon.</i>

609
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,725
<i>OK, bye.</i>

610
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:23,363
- Maybe we can still take a shower.
- Honey...

611
00:34:24,276 --> 00:34:25,995
I'm so sorry. What else can we do?

612
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,278
Honey, I'm taking the champagne,
I'm taking every bit...

613
00:34:29,448 --> 00:34:31,525
- of this chocolate.
- Gotta get some coffee.

614
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,825
- Get the chocolate, that's important.
- I'm taking all of these things.

615
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:37,806
I read this article in Cosmo.

616
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:42,041
"More pearls, less swine." It's about
bad dating habits and how to break 'em.

617
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:44,043
- I've read that one.
- Shut up! That list

618
00:34:44,258 --> 00:34:46,921
of toxic signs?
I swear to God, Billy's ten for ten.

619
00:34:47,197 --> 00:34:49,131
"Does he put his happiness
before yours?" Check.

620
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:51,467
It's true, maybe you gotta...

621
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:53,261
let the loser go.

622
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:55,513
That's a great idea.

623
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:57,525
I think that you should...

624
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,827
I think that you should move on!

625
00:34:59,952 --> 00:35:02,937
I mean, do you know
how much time I have wasted

626
00:35:03,107 --> 00:35:04,619
on Tim Riggins?

627
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,691
But I have to focus on me.

628
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:10,361
- I'm going to Vanderbilt next year...
- Shut up! You got in?

629
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:11,696
No...

630
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:12,902
but I will.

631
00:35:13,982 --> 00:35:16,242
OK. Well,
I don't know where that is,

632
00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:18,995
but it sounds fancy pants
and I have a little present for you.

633
00:35:19,165 --> 00:35:21,539
- You know that I really like this song?
- This is...

634
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:23,708
mom's favorite
man-hater breakup music.

635
00:35:23,878 --> 00:35:25,209
It makes me wanna dance.

636
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,420
Yeah, it gets a lot of playing time
around here.

637
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,172
- To man hating. Ready?
- OK.

638
00:35:33,324 --> 00:35:34,533
I love this!

639
00:35:34,703 --> 00:35:36,118
It's so good.

640
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:41,693
You know this, right here,
what this is?

641
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,477
An anti-Riggins force field.

642
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:45,564
There ain't no...

643
00:35:45,694 --> 00:35:48,524
- Billy in my chili, yo.
- No Billy in your chili.

644
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:52,521
- What was that move you were doing?
- Thought I'd, like...

645
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:55,299
Mindy!

646
00:35:57,929 --> 00:35:59,479
Oh, God!
Now, shake it!

647
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:02,556
Shake it up!
Shake it! Shake it!

648
00:36:07,235 --> 00:36:09,030
What is that?
What are you doing?

649
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:10,317
No, no!

650
00:36:10,572 --> 00:36:12,465
- Mindy, come on, open up.
- I gotta go pee.

651
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:15,426
- I can totally see you.
- Go away, Billy! Nobody likes you!

652
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:17,038
Come on, open up!

653
00:36:17,163 --> 00:36:20,097
- It's a Riggins brother.
- Come on, baby. I'm sorry.

654
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,224
You can go back to your job,
I don't care.

655
00:36:24,078 --> 00:36:26,603
I just want you back.
I'm sorry, sweetie.

656
00:36:27,607 --> 00:36:28,613
I love you.

657
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,150
Give me one more chance, please.

658
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:32,785
I love you.

659
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:34,653
No, no!

660
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:36,746
Mindy, no!

661
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:40,493
- Oh, Mindy.
- Shut up, shut up!

662
00:36:42,217 --> 00:36:45,058
- Don't ever leave me.
- I'm not gonna leave you.

663
00:36:47,211 --> 00:36:48,949
- What's that tape?
- Love that music,

664
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:51,420
- you still don't like it.
- No, that music is awful, honey.

665
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:53,931
... I said the Hilton,
I didn't say the Woodson.

666
00:36:55,901 --> 00:36:57,916
- Wait, slow down.
- Why? I got the money.

667
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,711
- I don't care.
- I'll pay 'em back.

668
00:36:59,836 --> 00:37:01,946
I don't care.
You left me with all those men.

669
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:04,266
- I said I was coming back!
- I don't care!

670
00:37:05,153 --> 00:37:07,327
Damn it! Tyra!
We're talking about this!

671
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:09,605
You're not leaving.
Damn it, Tyra!

672
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,411
Tyra, sit down!

673
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:14,490
- Help me, please!
- No, I'm not letting you leave.

674
00:37:15,918 --> 00:37:16,821
Easy.

675
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,490
- Damn it, Tyra!
- Get in the car, get in.

676
00:37:20,062 --> 00:37:21,992
Tyra, please!
Baby, I'm sorry.

677
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:24,412
- Calm down a second.
- I'm not calming down.

678
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:26,372
Tyra, please, come on!

679
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:28,124
- Get in the car.
- Let me explain.

680
00:37:28,294 --> 00:37:30,710
I'm sorry.
Come on, babe.

681
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,888
- Damn it, Tyra. I'm sorry.
- All right? Easy now.

682
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:35,141
Damn it!

683
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:39,593
Tyra, come on.

684
00:37:40,317 --> 00:37:41,725
Son of a bitch!

685
00:38:14,557 --> 00:38:15,834
You all right?

686
00:38:17,618 --> 00:38:18,651
Yes, ma'am.

687
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:23,603
Really?

688
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:33,140
Thank you.

689
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:47,119
7 = 5x + 4...

690
00:38:51,016 --> 00:38:53,069
- What are you doing?
- Calculus.

691
00:38:54,524 --> 00:38:55,923
I got you something.

692
00:38:58,752 --> 00:39:01,091
I did a little research
and found out that most of the colleges

693
00:39:01,261 --> 00:39:04,804
have January 15th
as the deadline for fall admission.

694
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:08,621
Yeah, I think... I think Mr. Shea
said something about that.

695
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,935
You can fill out
your application online

696
00:39:11,105 --> 00:39:14,188
and that still gives you a whole month
to get transcripts, write the essay...

697
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:16,148
You can still do it, Matt.

698
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:19,043
Yeah, but what am I gonna do
about grandma?

699
00:39:20,904 --> 00:39:22,866
I'm sure we could work
something out.

700
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,950
OK, but then, how am I supposed
to pay for it?

701
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,308
We could rob a bank.

702
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,206
I drive the getaway car, you go in,
grandma covers the door.

703
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,123
There's an image!

704
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,295
I don't know,
we'll figure out the money thing, too.

705
00:39:38,887 --> 00:39:41,451
There's still scholarships
for children of the military.

706
00:39:41,576 --> 00:39:42,821
That's an option.

707
00:39:43,357 --> 00:39:46,303
It's gotta be good
to get the ball rolling, you know.

708
00:39:48,063 --> 00:39:49,913
Yeah, you're probably right.

709
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:52,309
There was one of them that had...

710
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,097
this really great
Fine Art Department.

711
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:57,606
This one, in San Francisco.

712
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:02,361
Come on, catch the football.

713
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,169
There you go.

714
00:40:05,701 --> 00:40:06,741
It's alive!

715
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:09,826
I thought I was gonna have
to send in Search and Rescue.

716
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:11,829
- Dad, you don't have to yell...
- It's already

717
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:15,228
beer thirty in here. What are you
doing, with sleeping so late?

718
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,097
Let's see.
It's not your mother,

719
00:40:20,266 --> 00:40:22,759
I don't have any friends...
Who could that be?

720
00:40:22,884 --> 00:40:23,929
I got it.

721
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:26,010
I'll bet I know.

722
00:40:35,191 --> 00:40:36,353
What are you doing?

723
00:40:36,808 --> 00:40:39,004
- What do you want?
- Wanna come outside and play with me?

724
00:40:39,129 --> 00:40:41,671
- Why don't you wanna play?
- Tim, I'm not in the mood for this.

725
00:40:41,796 --> 00:40:43,071
OK, I got in.

726
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,954
- You got in what?
- I'm in. College, in.

727
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,451
I'm in college.

728
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:49,752
I'm going to college.

729
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:54,929
I met with the recruiter, I sat down,
we filled out some paperwork,

730
00:40:55,054 --> 00:40:58,334
he said I'm in. There's more paperwork
to be done, but apparently,

731
00:40:58,504 --> 00:41:01,780
even some half-scholarship,
or even more, I don't even know yet.

732
00:41:01,905 --> 00:41:03,154
But I'm in.

733
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:06,133
Still nothing.

734
00:41:06,303 --> 00:41:09,553
Do you need me to say you were right
and I was wrong? Cause you were right.

735
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,684
It's not working yet, is it?
Let me cover my bases here.

736
00:41:16,312 --> 00:41:17,312
One,

737
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:18,767
I'm sorry.

738
00:41:19,149 --> 00:41:21,065
Two, I mean it,
I'm really sorry.

739
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:25,162
Three, thank you.
Four, I wanna go celebrate.

740
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:28,364
I only want to celebrate with you,
'cause I wouldn't be here without you.

741
00:41:29,181 --> 00:41:32,284
Five, say yes. At this point,
come on. I'll keep going.

742
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:34,217
- Did you really get in?
- Yes.

743
00:41:34,342 --> 00:41:36,789
Only Riggins to get in, yet.
Probably the last.

744
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:38,245
I knew you would.

745
00:41:38,952 --> 00:41:39,959
I told you.

746
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:42,638
Kinda crazy.

747
00:41:43,623 --> 00:41:44,713
That's great.

748
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,694
Hey, because of you.

749
00:41:47,723 --> 00:41:49,009
I'm in because of you.

750
00:41:49,335 --> 00:41:50,785
So, yeah, you can...

751
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:54,056
Are you on a bender right now?

752
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:57,374
I almost got a buzz
off your breath, there.

753
00:41:57,499 --> 00:41:59,770
That's, like, I don't think
it's safe for me to drive strong

754
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,607
right now, and for me to say that,
that's a lot, you know.

755
00:42:03,777 --> 00:42:06,389
- Sorry.
- Don't be, it's fantastic.

756
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,689
Let me get drunk then.
I'll come with you, I'm on board.

757
00:42:14,484 --> 00:42:15,734
I'm on board.

758
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:03,737
I found Matt and Julie
in bed together this afternoon.

759
00:43:08,373 --> 00:43:09,423
You're, like,

760
00:43:09,593 --> 00:43:11,967
this young, wholesome,
milk-drinking quarterback.

761
00:43:13,101 --> 00:43:14,101
There we go.

762
00:43:14,347 --> 00:43:16,806
I took the savings money
and made a risky investment,

763
00:43:16,975 --> 00:43:18,807
- and I lost the money.
- So I'll get a job

764
00:43:18,977 --> 00:43:21,477
and I'll help out
until I go to college.

765
00:43:22,204 --> 00:43:23,812
Lyla, I used the college money.
