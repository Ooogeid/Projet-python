1
00:00:01,285 --> 00:00:01,984
Dad?

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:04,019
You're home!

3
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:06,168
Hello, Brian.

4
00:00:06,515 --> 00:00:07,369
Waverly?

5
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:09,003
Damn girl, look.

6
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:11,480
I don't know where you been,
but time's sure been good to you.

7
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:13,917
You said if we were gonna sue anybody,
it was gonna be the school, Dad.

8
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,395
- You said nothing about Coach Taylor.
- Jason. Take it easy, okay?

9
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:19,839
This was not Coach Taylor's fault.
Coach Taylor did not make that tackle.

10
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:20,870
I did.

11
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:23,752
- What did I tell you about using the stove?
- What?

12
00:00:23,827 --> 00:00:25,192
You're acting like a damn child.

13
00:00:25,227 --> 00:00:26,579
Calm down, it's just--
it was an accident.

14
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:27,841
Are you okay?
It's okay.

15
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:29,413
I don't even know
what happened.

16
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:31,611
I thought you were gonna come home from Iraq
and actually be able to help,

17
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:33,310
but you've only
made things worse.

18
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:35,791
- Now get in the truck.
- Go to hell, Dad.

19
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:44,911
<i>Well, it is just
a couple of more days</i>

20
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:46,943
<i>until the future of Dillon football</i>

21
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:50,371
<i>is determined by the outcome of
the Buckley-Arnett Mead game.</i>

22
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:53,753
<i>Buckley's star running back, Denny,
is hotter than a pistol right now, folks.</i>

23
00:00:53,927 --> 00:00:57,363
<i>And if he can help his team
overcome powerhouse Arnett Mead,</i>

24
00:00:57,505 --> 00:01:00,550
<i>that means our Panthers
will be in the playoffs.</i>

25
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:02,871
<i>It all comes down
to Friday night, Panther fans.</i>

26
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:04,181
<i>The hog's out of the gate,</i>

27
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:06,443
<i>the clock is ticking, and it is on.</i>

28
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:08,510
We are not gonna sit
on our asses

29
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:11,602
to wait and see if Buckley
beats Arnett Mead this Friday

30
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:12,600
or not, gentlemen.

31
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:15,561
We're gonna stay focused,
and we're gonna stay working.

32
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:18,883
Some things you can control.
Some things you cannot.

33
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:20,521
Time, you cannot control.

34
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:21,701
Time's our enemy.

35
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:24,940
I do not want y'all driving
yourselves crazy this week.

36
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:26,900
What happens, happens.

37
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:30,810
Ain't no spell or no bag of juju
gonna change that.

38
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:32,673
So what we're gonna do
is we're gonna stay out here

39
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:34,412
and we're gonna
work our asses off.

40
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,032
If the good Lord
and/or Buckley defense

41
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:39,491
decides we should get
one more shot at this thing,

42
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:42,332
well, by God,
we're gonna be ready for it.

43
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:44,252
Arnett Mead's got Johnson.

44
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:46,382
Everybody say he's one of
the best QBs in the state,

45
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:47,943
but he can't win a game
by himself.

46
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:50,532
The way I see it,
Buckley need to play Denny.

47
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:52,221
He had three sacks last Friday.

48
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:53,652
He's cold-blooded.

49
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:55,543
Ain't got nothing on me,
but he cold-blooded.

50
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:57,113
Hey, where you going?

51
00:01:57,178 --> 00:01:59,151
I got a trumpet needs polishing.

52
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:01,613
She gonna try to play me.

53
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:06,082
She don't even get it.
She don't even get it.

54
00:02:07,696 --> 00:02:10,761
Buckley's got to make them
spread the defense.

55
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,571
Not be so one-dimensional.

56
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:14,153
That's the only way
they got a chance.

57
00:02:14,206 --> 00:02:15,462
Well, I'll tell Coac-

58
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:17,473
Oh, shoot.

59
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:18,561
Damn it.

60
00:02:19,337 --> 00:02:20,943
I'll get it. I'm sorry.

61
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:23,273
She making any sense at all?

62
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:24,992
Think Arnett Mead
could possibly lose?

63
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:26,681
They're favored by a lot,

64
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:28,842
but Buckley does have Denny.
I mean,

65
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:31,823
he can be surprising.
He can just break a game open, so...

66
00:02:32,228 --> 00:02:34,282
Well, I hope Denny
kicks Arnett Mead's ass.

67
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,933
'Cause I'd like to see you QB
in that playoff game.

68
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,753
You won't even
be here then, anyway.

69
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,583
Denny, Denny's good.

70
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:42,013
Actually, I will.

71
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:44,372
I'm not gonna go back to Iraq.

72
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:46,203
He's been good a long time.

73
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:49,582
I'm gonna stay here
with you and Grandma.

74
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:51,650
Really?

75
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:52,941
Yeah.

76
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:55,972
If that's all right with you.

77
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:58,652
Yeah, that's fine.

78
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,542
All  right.

79
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:01,202
Spread the defense!

80
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,742
I got you spreading the defense--

81
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:05,261
Arnett Mead tries to key on Denny,
eight in the box.

82
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,293
Honey?
Will you just think about something else?

83
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:08,932
What do you want me
to think about?

84
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:11,391
There's things going on in the world.
You could think about...

85
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:14,133
- the little children in...
- Oh, my heavens.

86
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:15,243
India...

87
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:17,371
You know what, there is nothing else
to think about.

88
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,380
Oh, baby.

89
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:20,390
There is nothing else
to think about.

90
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:22,903
You can think about how much you love me.
That's a good idea.

91
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,460
Why wouldn't you think about that?

92
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:25,883
Coach Eric Taylor?

93
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,220
- Hi.
- Yeah?

94
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:33,742
- What's this?
- You've been served.

95
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:36,722
Served by who?

96
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:38,700
Jason Street's family.

97
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:40,910
What?

98
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:42,752
That was it.

99
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:46,721
Uh, hey, Coach.

100
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:49,452
Uh, you think old Buckley's
got a shot against Arnett Mead?

105
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:43,001
I can't believe
they would sue us.

106
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:45,912
You raised Jason Street.

107
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,072
You raised him
on that football field.

108
00:04:49,316 --> 00:04:52,233
How could they possibly
blame you for what happened?

109
00:04:52,235 --> 00:04:54,201
Oh, it's--
it's one of those things.

110
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:55,680
You can't make it personal.

111
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:58,163
They were probably
advised to do it by lawyers.

112
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:01,020
It's what people do now.

113
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:02,772
It's what they do.

114
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:05,532
We're covered by the school,
and it's...

115
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:10,802
It's not personal.
You just gotta look at it that way.

116
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:13,493
- Mmm...
- That's just what people do.

117
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:45,903
Ah. Morning, Clint.

118
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:48,052
How you doing today?

119
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:48,981
Busy.

120
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:50,531
Got a big game Friday night.

121
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:52,900
I got some interesting theories
on Arnett Mead, if you--

122
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:54,332
if you got some time 
to talk about it.

123
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:55,401
Can't shoot the bull today.

124
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:57,281
I've got a lot of work
waiting in the back.

125
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:02,710
Okay, I'll just, uh...

126
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:04,293
I'll leave the money
on the counter.

127
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:35,053
Are--are we asking if Grandma's tests
are covered under-- under the F1 provision?

128
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:38,460
No,  'cause I think the F1,
it only covers the bloodwork.

129
00:06:39,335 --> 00:06:41,452
I mean, I can't make heads or tails
of any of this.

130
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:47,503
So how's the, uh,
job hunt going?

131
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:50,572
Not really
a boom town here, Matt.

132
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:51,541
Hold  on.

133
00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:55,153
Yes, I need to speak to somebody
about my mother's coverage?

134
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:57,111
Name is Lorraine Saracen.

135
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:01,373
Jason Street should not be
suing the Panthers.

136
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:03,173
Why not, Bob?

137
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:04,822
'Cause they've done
so much for him?

138
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:08,053
What, they bought him some flowers,
gave him a football, threw him some

139
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:10,380
lame-ass pancake supper.

140
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,580
You know, I'm sure that
just about covers everything.

141
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:13,960
Well, look who it is.
Tyra the mouth.

142
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:16,033
Your money, honey,
is on the counter for lunch.

143
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:18,630
- Honey? Honey.
- Yes, uh...

144
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,202
Seen these jeans
your daughter's wearing?

145
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:24,892
- What?
- You okay with these?

146
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:26,639
What?

147
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,930
Man, you ladies have
a genetically superior ass.

148
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:33,820
It runs in this family.

149
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:36,450
- Bye, Mom. I'm leaving.
- Oh, bye.

150
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:38,533
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

151
00:07:40,996 --> 00:07:42,302
I'm telling you,
I was at Clint's store

152
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:43,661
and he wouldn't even
look me in the eye.

153
00:07:43,948 --> 00:07:44,952
I told you

154
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:46,421
that this was going to happen.

155
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:47,930
Now it's in the papers?

156
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,330
It's done, it's done.

157
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:50,673
On top of being
the crippled kid,

158
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:51,773
- now everyone's just gonna hate me.
- Jason...

159
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:52,440
Thanks a lot.

160
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:54,021
- You knew we had no choice.
- You had it.

161
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:57,120
You don't go against the Panthers
in this town and you know that.

162
00:07:57,985 --> 00:07:59,520
Jason, you knew
this was gonna happen.

163
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:01,321
And I said it was a bad idea!

164
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:02,481
All right.

165
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:05,343
Jason...

166
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:06,812
Honey.

167
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:10,411
I'm your mother.

168
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:15,440
And there is nothing
that I wouldn't do for you.

169
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:19,721
To give you what you need
to survive right now,

170
00:08:21,106 --> 00:08:22,222
we need money.

171
00:08:24,835 --> 00:08:25,861
I'm just...

172
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,713
I've come to terms with the fact
that there are people

173
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:30,051
in this town who aren't gonna
understand that.

174
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:34,623
I'm...

175
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:40,761
I am so sorry I have
to put you through this.

176
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,441
- Mom...
- You have no idea-- You have no idea.

177
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:47,801
- I mean...
- It's okay, I'm not--

178
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:50,640
Coach should've put you
through tackling drills, right?

179
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:53,611
He should've done that.

180
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:01,232
I'm sorry, honey.

181
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,203
May--maybe he should've.

182
00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:07,990
Maybe he should've.

183
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,262
Everybody in?

184
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:17,911
All right, listen up.

185
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,303
Little issue has come
to my attention, gentlemen.

186
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:25,230
The annual Women's Booster League
Rodeo Fundraiser and Fair.

187
00:09:25,368 --> 00:09:28,271
- Shut up, shut up.
- Hey, hey, hey.

188
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:31,041
I know y'all would rather be
sweating out game night by yourselves

189
00:09:31,046 --> 00:09:32,960
instead of being at the rodeo.
So would I.

190
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:34,552
But you know what?
These women work hard.

191
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:35,602
It's a good cause.

192
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:38,840
So we are all
gonna show our asses up there

193
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:41,780
with smiles on our faces.

194
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:44,423
Now let's go
have some fun.

195
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:49,413
Oh, really?
That game...

196
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:51,970
Hang on just a second.

197
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:53,112
Matt Saracen.

198
00:09:53,185 --> 00:09:55,413
- Hey, Mr. Garrity.
- How you doin', son?

199
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:57,393
- I'm doing all right.
- What can I do for you?

200
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,503
- Well, if you're busy, I don't want to--
- Wait a minute.

201
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:01,472
That's all right.
Roger, Roger.

202
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:03,753
Take care of that for me.
I'll be right back.

203
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:05,640
Are you sure?
I really didn't want to interrupt you...

204
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:08,010
- Oh no, no, nonsense, son.
- Okay.

205
00:10:08,096 --> 00:10:10,160
Those are just people.
You're my quarterback.

206
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:11,992
Okay.

207
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:14,053
My dad's decided
to stay here in Dillon

208
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:15,772
and not go back to Iraq.

209
00:10:16,277 --> 00:10:17,731
So that I--I can stay here,

210
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:20,390
and I don't have to move
to Oklahoma with my aunt.

211
00:10:21,616 --> 00:10:22,900
Well, that's damn good.

212
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:24,091
We'd hate to lose you.

213
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:25,022
Thanks.

214
00:10:25,315 --> 00:10:26,140
Well, anyway, since--

215
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:28,400
Since he's not gonna be
working in Iraq,

216
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,101
he needs to be
working here.

217
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:33,840
And--and there's not
a lot of work here.

218
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:38,233
So I was just curious
if maybe you...

219
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:40,783
If you know of anything.

220
00:10:40,786 --> 00:10:41,870
That--or--

221
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,781
Have  any suggestions, maybe.

222
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:45,212
Well, Matt...

223
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:47,791
I'll tell you what you do.

224
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,110
If you will send your dad
over to me,

225
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:51,630
I can put him to work
immediately.

226
00:10:51,637 --> 00:10:53,321
You know, I probably--

227
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:56,583
I could use a new salesman.
Our sales are going through the roof right now.

228
00:10:56,678 --> 00:10:58,880
You send your daddy over to me,
and I'll take care of him.

229
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:01,201
- How's that sound?
- Are you-- Th--

230
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,100
- thank you so much, Mr. Garrity.
- Oh, you're welcome, son.

231
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:05,812
- Come back and see me.
- I will, I will.

232
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:07,421
Yeah. Hey, you like to hunt?

233
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:08,300
All right.

234
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,143
Oh hey, listen.

235
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:12,160
I was just gonna let you know,
your bill's up to about $294.04.

236
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:14,680
So you can bring a check in
sometime, that'd be great.

237
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,320
- Thanks.
- All right. Bye.

238
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,261
Hey, Mitch.

239
00:11:24,378 --> 00:11:26,160
Can I talk to you a minute?

240
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:36,283
Eric, man, I am so sorry.

241
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:38,102
I don't know who it was
behind this.

242
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:39,611
I know it's not you.

243
00:11:43,348 --> 00:11:45,290
- I-I just didn't know what else to do, man.
- I understand

244
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:46,151
You know, I--

245
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:47,602
Hey, listen,
when I got served the papers,

246
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,540
I said, "I know this isn't
coming from Mitch and Joanne.

247
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:50,780
I know it's not."

248
00:11:50,787 --> 00:11:52,723
Expenses are astronomical,
Coach.

249
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:54,170
- Look, I understand.
- Eric--

250
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:56,510
You probably realize, too,
it's not a great idea

251
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,463
to get yourself involved
in a lawsuit

252
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:00,523
that's gonna cause you
that much additional pain.

253
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:03,472
And you know this is
gonna get you nowhere.

254
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:09,632
I'm not so sure
that's the case.

255
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,582
Well, hell, Mitch,
what are you gonna do?

256
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:13,520
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna sue the school?

257
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:16,333
What are you gonna prove?
That the school was negligent?

258
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:18,022
And how the hell
are you gonna do that?

259
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:19,471
I was there.
You were there.

260
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,451
- Everybody was there.
- I can't talk to you about this.

261
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,851
Mitch, it was a horrible accident,
but it was nobody's fault.

262
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:27,003
- It was nobody's fault.
- I cannot talk to you

263
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,150
about this. 

264
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:34,303
You think this is tough
for you?

265
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:37,023
You wanna try
losing your child's legs

266
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:38,930
and losing
your child's future

267
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:41,983
and every penny
that you ever saved.

268
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:43,652
Try that on for size.

269
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:44,883
And then after that, try-

270
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:46,951
try finding where in the hell
you're gonna come up with money

271
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:49,782
to put up the ramps and doorways
all over your house,

272
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:53,642
and  pay for the unending equipment
and physical therapy.

273
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:55,892
Hell, I don't want to sue anyone.

274
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:57,892
It's killing me to do this.

275
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:03,502
But since
I'm already dead...

276
00:13:06,306 --> 00:13:08,901
It doesn't matter anyway,
now does it?

277
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:16,521
Just get the hell
out of here, Coach.

278
00:13:18,776 --> 00:13:20,873
Get out of here.

279
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:37,402
Hey,I don't know anything
about selling cars

280
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:39,460
- Hello, Matt!
- Hey, Mr. Garrity.

281
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:42,951
- How are you, son?
- This is my dad, Hen--Henry Saracen.

282
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,200
- Henry, very nice to meet you, sir.
- Very nice to meet you.

283
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,362
- Welcome to Garrity Motors.
- Thank you.

284
00:13:47,365 --> 00:13:50,601
We are very proud to have our very own
quarterback's dad on our team.

285
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:52,541
I can tell you that right now.

286
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,362
- Well, I appreciate that.
- You bet.

287
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,493
Just step back here
and we'll set you all up.

288
00:13:56,498 --> 00:13:57,882
Easy as pie.

289
00:13:57,888 --> 00:13:59,510
Matt, take a look at some cars.

290
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:01,732
- Test-drive one if you want to.
- Yeah, okay.

291
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:04,600
This way, Henry. I--let me tell you,
this is really, really simple.

292
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:06,821
And we got
a friendly, friendly place.

293
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,922
Lot of people I think you'll enjoy working...

294
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:11,881
Hey, Waverly.

295
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,702
How's the tuba looking?

296
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:15,401
Bright and shiny
like your forehead.

297
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:16,792
And it's a trumpet.

298
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:19,530
How's the endless speculation
of who's gonna win

299
00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:21,923
that game you guys
were talking about going?

300
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:24,643
Yeah, well, it's not like my whole life
don't hang in the balance.

301
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:27,071
Is that why you walked out on me
at the diner yesterday?

302
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:29,020
I didn't walk out on you.

303
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:30,530
You weren't talking to me,
anyway.

304
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,852
I was sitting
right next to you.

305
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:34,043
That is so not
the same thing.

306
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:35,963
All right, look.

307
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:37,752
Look, I know
you been gone a while.

308
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:39,010
But there's a few rules about

309
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:40,921
what's right and what's wrong
that you need to know.

310
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:42,682
Number one,

311
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:44,350
don't nobody walk out
on Smash.

312
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:47,680
Oh, good. The return
of the third person.

313
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:50,080
You know,
as fascinating as it is

314
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:52,030
to sit there
and listen to everyone talk

315
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:53,170
about how great you are,

316
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:55,020
the Waverly
has better things to do.

317
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:57,181
What's wrong with you, girl?
You know you like me.

318
00:14:57,557 --> 00:14:59,680
I do like you.
I just...

319
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:01,901
I don't think we have
anything in common.

320
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:03,072
Yeah, we do.

321
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:05,071
Look, you tell me what you want
to have in common,

322
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,711
and I'll get it in common.

323
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:08,743
Come on, work with me, girl.
I'm trying here.

324
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:11,060
All right.
Um...is there anything

325
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:14,143
about you
that isn't football 24/7?

326
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:16,661
Hell, yeah.

327
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:22,342
- Uh...
- Anything else that you talk about?

328
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:24,873
Do you have
any other friends that...

329
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,920
Matt Saracen
and Julie Taylor.

330
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,310
We chill all the time.

331
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:31,873
Talk about a whole mess of stuff
besides football.

332
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:33,942
I mean... Immigration,

333
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:37,730
Iraq...
books, music.

334
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:40,171
Stem cell research.
Global warming. You name it.

335
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:42,791
In fact, I'm going to the rodeo
with them on Friday.

336
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:45,851
You should come along.
See what I mean.

337
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:48,880
All right.

338
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:51,401
We'll give the Waverlash
one last try.

339
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:53,502
The Waverlash?

340
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:54,983
That's what you called it?

341
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,422
Oh, that Smash mouth
contagious, girl.

342
00:15:57,947 --> 00:15:59,183
Matt, sweetie?

343
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:00,633
Don't forget
about my tea.

344
00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:02,940
I know, I won't, Gran--
The water's almost ready there.

345
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:04,391
You know, I hate for you
to wait on me,

346
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,801
but I promised y'all I wouldn't
mess with that stove.

347
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,043
Oh, shoot.

348
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:15,021
Um, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

349
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:16,883
I've been sitting at the library
for an hour.

350
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:19,533
And that's my fault. And I apologize.
It's just that my--

351
00:16:19,657 --> 00:16:21,192
My grandma called,
and she thought

352
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:22,981
that there was this really
big mouse in the house,

353
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:26,192
so I came home, and then
this whole place was sort of a mess.

354
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,362
So I started cleaning it up.

355
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:29,342
And then I remembered
that I had to get dinner ready

356
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:30,792
- before my dad gets home,
- Matty, I sure could use that tea.

357
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:32,733
and I gotta make tea
for my grandma.

358
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:34,331
It's on its way, Grandma.

359
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:36,150
- Um, so I gotta be--
- Okay, how about

360
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:38,811
you make dinner and I'll
make your grandma some tea?

361
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:42,671
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

362
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:45,141
Well, thanks.

363
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:47,892
Would now be a bad time
to tell you that I told Smash

364
00:16:47,897 --> 00:16:49,923
that we'd double-date
with him and Waverly

365
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:51,653
and we'd pretend
that we do that a lot,

366
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:55,101
and we talk about all sorts of
neat stuff besides football?

367
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,190
- I heard you!
- The last time you went out

368
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:02,012
with this loser, you were gone
for three days.

369
00:17:02,016 --> 00:17:03,742
- I won't have that again--
- All right, all right, all right!

370
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:04,452
No!

371
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,930
- I said no. You heard me. 
- No?

372
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:07,040
What the hell
is the matter with you?

373
00:17:07,046 --> 00:17:09,322
Are you telling me when I can
and can't leave this house?

374
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,440
- It has nothing to do--
- Are you high?

375
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:11,770
Bob, it has nothing to do
with that--

376
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:13,160
You know why people leave you?

377
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,350
Because you
drive people crazy!

378
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:17,053
Put a bullet in my head.

379
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:20,280
Get  out of my way!
Get out of my way!

380
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:21,711
- Don't you dare touch her.
- Tyra!

381
00:17:21,718 --> 00:17:23,400
Get the hell away from her!
Get the hell out!

382
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:25,403
Don't you ever
touch my mother again.

383
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:26,872
I will kill you!

384
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:28,121
I'll kill you!

385
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:29,593
Get the hell out!

386
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:30,943
You understand?

387
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:32,031
Do you understand me?

388
00:17:32,538 --> 00:17:34,050
Get out, get out.

389
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:35,432
Get out, get out.

390
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:38,812
Do it!
Do it!

391
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:39,883
Get out of here!
Do it.

392
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:41,592
- Get out, get out.
- Do it.

393
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:43,081
Get out, get out.

394
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:44,152
Get out.

395
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:47,411
Oh, my God.

396
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:56,743
Hey, babe.

397
00:17:58,796 --> 00:18:00,223
I love you guys.

398
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:05,041
And you guys are the best parents
in the world.

399
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:09,940
Good night.

400
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:16,891
No, honey.

401
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,623
Something terrible
must've happened.

402
00:18:20,718 --> 00:18:21,952
Julie?

403
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:28,440
There's no adult
looking out for him.

404
00:18:29,046 --> 00:18:29,892
I mean, it's crazy.

405
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:30,841
He's just by himself,

406
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:32,131
doing the cooking,

407
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:33,963
and the cleaning,
the shopping.

408
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:35,570
He takes care
of his grandma.

409
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,201
His dad's been home
for two weeks,

410
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:39,043
and there's still a table
full of insurance forms

411
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:40,150
for his grandma.

412
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,162
And he has school,

413
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:44,202
and work, and football.

414
00:18:46,336 --> 00:18:47,080
I just...

415
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,523
I feel like
it's just gonna crush him.

416
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:52,443
Nothing's going to crush
Matt Saracen.

417
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:55,253
He's like a little stinkbug.
You can't crush him.

418
00:18:55,817 --> 00:18:57,161
He's tough.
He'll be fine.

419
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:58,290
Well...

420
00:18:58,478 --> 00:19:00,070
I do think it is an awful lot

421
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:02,270
for one 16-year-old to have to handle.

422
00:19:03,027 --> 00:19:04,610
I might be able
to do something.

423
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,782
I don't know. Have him
come see me at school.

424
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:08,132
Okay.

425
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:10,490
Thanks, Mom.
Good night.

426
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:11,321
Good night.

427
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:12,923
You're the best.

428
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:15,980
What do you mean, she's the best?
What about me?

429
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:17,840
Hey!

430
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:25,062
Aren't you gonna get up?

431
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,002
I don't think he's coming back.

432
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:33,222
God, Mom,
he's just a stupid guy.

433
00:19:33,657 --> 00:19:35,611
It's not like Jesus Christ
just left you.

434
00:19:39,957 --> 00:19:42,761
I'm just not used
to being alone.

435
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:46,712
But you're not alone.

436
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:49,622
You got me.

437
00:20:12,226 --> 00:20:13,612
Nice, Henry.

438
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:15,311
Bagged 'em.

439
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,770
Oh...
God.

440
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:28,410
Where'd they go?

441
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,151
I thought they were ready
to take delivery

442
00:20:30,158 --> 00:20:31,312
when I handed them to you.

443
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:32,852
Well, it turned out it wasn't

444
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,671
a good time for them, financially.

445
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:36,282
Henry...

446
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:39,782
It's never a bad time
with 5.9% financing.

447
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:41,401
Never a bad time.

448
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,243
I got an idea.
Come with me.

449
00:20:48,685 --> 00:20:49,931
I tell you what I'd like
for you to do,

450
00:20:49,936 --> 00:20:52,163
I'd like for you
to wear this.

451
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:53,593
And it'll just

452
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:54,751
help to remind people

453
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:57,121
that you served this country
for 20 years.

454
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,012
I don't know if I would
think that was right,

455
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:04,273
using that to sell cars.

456
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:08,562
Well, Henry...
um, salesmen...

457
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,160
they sell themselves.

458
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:15,123
I mean you are what you are.

459
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:17,361
And that's something
to be proud of.

460
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:20,262
And I'll just tell you right now,
I have the greatest respect...

461
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:22,643
for our men in the military.

462
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,931
You guys are what
makes this country great.

463
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:28,050
And God bless you.

464
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:36,093
All right.

465
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:39,241
Yes, sir.

466
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:41,031
I think that'll help.

467
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:43,033
Looks good.

468
00:21:58,178 --> 00:21:59,553
Someone sleeping over?

469
00:21:59,608 --> 00:22:00,990
There's sheets on the couch.

470
00:22:01,777 --> 00:22:03,542
No, that's my dad.

471
00:22:04,398 --> 00:22:05,902
Him and mom are just
fighting a lot now.

472
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:08,920
They're just like pissed at each other
even when nothing's going on.

473
00:22:10,957 --> 00:22:12,412
I think it's just all...

474
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:14,010
All this, you know?

475
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:17,180
Jason, do you think this lawsuit
is the best idea?

476
00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:21,202
- You been talkin' to Buddy?
- No.

477
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,042
I'm just asking you
as someone who loves you.

478
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:25,803
And is on your side.

479
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:29,200
I can't come up with
anything else. I mean...

480
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:31,410
Everything costs so damn much.
I mean, there's just...

481
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:35,813
But everyone would have
looked out for your family.

482
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:37,392
The town cripple?

483
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:40,172
How long do you think that charity
would have lasted, huh?

484
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:43,233
It's killing me to have to
do this to coach.

485
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:45,092
And it's killing me to have
to do this to the team.

486
00:22:45,105 --> 00:22:47,052
But maybe they're all right.

487
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:49,411
The lawyers, my parents,
maybe they're right.

488
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:52,612
Maybe someone teaches me
how to tackle somebody,

489
00:22:52,616 --> 00:22:54,140
I'm not in a chair.

490
00:22:56,538 --> 00:22:57,841
We're not in this mess.

491
00:23:01,786 --> 00:23:03,711
If you think this is
for the best, then...

492
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:05,641
I'm with you.

493
00:23:11,617 --> 00:23:12,372
What is it with you

494
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,240
that you wanna
screw your life up for me?

495
00:23:15,098 --> 00:23:16,531
Love makes us
kind of stupid.

496
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:20,283
Well, thank God for that.

497
00:23:31,238 --> 00:23:32,092
Hey, Dad!

498
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:34,833
How was the first day
at work?

499
00:23:35,995 --> 00:23:36,972
It was great.

500
00:23:36,977 --> 00:23:37,952
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

501
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:39,140
Sell a bunch of cars?

502
00:23:39,736 --> 00:23:40,823
Actually, no.

503
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:43,213
What are you up to?

504
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,580
Um, you know, history.

505
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,982
All right, I'm gonna
wash up for dinner.

506
00:24:01,277 --> 00:24:02,163
Hey.

507
00:24:03,915 --> 00:24:05,022
Hey.

508
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:08,633
So what are you doing
out here?

509
00:24:10,336 --> 00:24:11,881
Honestly, I was just kinda

510
00:24:12,926 --> 00:24:15,362
wishing that Arnett Mead
loses to Buckley

511
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,821
and then we get to go
to the playoffs.

512
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:21,143
And then I don't have to spend
every day of the rest of my life

513
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:24,273
wondering what if as
I'm punching at the feed store.

514
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:26,742
The feed store?

515
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:30,532
Yeah, okay.

516
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:32,740
What is all that?

517
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:36,512
This is some kind
of frozen casserole.

518
00:24:37,107 --> 00:24:38,123
My mom made it.

519
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,621
Just thought
it would help out.

520
00:24:40,786 --> 00:24:42,532
Am I really that pathetic?

521
00:24:42,537 --> 00:24:44,213
No, you're not pathetic.

522
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:45,713
You just...

523
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:48,210
You just do so much, that...

524
00:24:49,497 --> 00:24:51,570
I just thought
you could use some help out.

525
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:03,190
I don't know
what I was expecting

526
00:25:03,198 --> 00:25:05,042
to be different
with my dad living here.

527
00:25:08,128 --> 00:25:11,832
Maybe he just needs some time
to settle in.

528
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:13,930
It seems like
the more he settles in,

529
00:25:13,938 --> 00:25:15,651
the more uncomfortable he gets.

530
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,421
I don't know.
I guess I wanted him

531
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:25,523
to want to be here,
not just to be here.

532
00:25:28,598 --> 00:25:30,893
It makes sense, though.
He's been in the Army

533
00:25:31,818 --> 00:25:33,833
for 20 years.
That's what he does,

534
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:35,333
what he's good at.

535
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:38,101
That's what he takes pride
in doing.

536
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:39,783
Now he's trying to be a dad.

537
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,830
And that means he's gotta
wake up and sell used cars

538
00:25:41,845 --> 00:25:44,590
every morning
for Buddy Garrity.

539
00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:48,032
I can't take it personally
that he's not happy here.

540
00:25:48,036 --> 00:25:50,140
Matt, you can just
get angry.

541
00:25:50,286 --> 00:25:51,600
No, I can't.

542
00:25:52,237 --> 00:25:53,540
He's trying.

543
00:25:55,257 --> 00:25:58,442
I mean, what else
can you really ask of anyone?

544
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:14,571
<i>Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen</i>

545
00:26:14,578 --> 00:26:17,983
<i>to the annual Women's
Booster's Club Rodeo Fair!</i>

546
00:26:52,887 --> 00:26:55,460
I'm getting gray hair
over this Arnett Mead game.

547
00:26:55,477 --> 00:26:57,721
Getting gray hair
over this damn lawsuit.

548
00:26:57,728 --> 00:26:59,561
I'm getting a lot
of gray hair this week.

549
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:01,392
And I'll tell you,
if this job gets cut out

550
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:03,050
from under me, there ain't
gonna be no more coaching.

551
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:04,631
- That's not gonna happen.
- No, that's what'll happen.

552
00:27:04,638 --> 00:27:06,633
Don't forget how good you are
at what you do.

553
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:08,913
That's the problem,
it's not up to me.

554
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:16,282
- I know we gotta go to the rodeo.
- Sorry, I know.

555
00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:18,901
So there's this art house theater

556
00:27:18,907 --> 00:27:21,010
about 40 miles from here.

557
00:27:21,436 --> 00:27:23,391
I saw just Cocteau's
Beauty and the Beast.

558
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:24,992
It was really cool.

559
00:27:24,997 --> 00:27:26,311
I mean, even Matt liked it.

560
00:27:26,496 --> 00:27:27,530
Wait, pause.

561
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:30,350
- Matt goes to foreign art films with you?
- Yeah.

562
00:27:32,535 --> 00:27:34,142
Uh, Smash does too.

563
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:36,293
He thought it was really interesting.

564
00:27:36,786 --> 00:27:37,480
Really?

565
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:40,000
Man, what the hell is Julie
getting my ass into?

566
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:41,480
Italian cinema?

567
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:44,693
Hey, have you heard anything
about the game?

568
00:27:44,877 --> 00:27:46,700
- Oh, you ain't hear?
- What?

569
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:48,263
Danny blew a knee.

570
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:49,120
No!

571
00:27:49,775 --> 00:27:50,770
No!

572
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:52,460
Oh man, we're finished.

573
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:54,633
Man, this is over.
We're done.

574
00:27:54,687 --> 00:27:56,760
Man, this ain't exactly
going the way I was hoping.

575
00:27:57,315 --> 00:27:58,073
What?

576
00:27:58,736 --> 00:27:59,643
What are you talking about?

577
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:01,331
Man, I've never
known a girl like this.

578
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:03,860
Like what?

579
00:28:03,978 --> 00:28:06,432
Like she won't pay attention to me,
but I know she likes me.

580
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:10,363
Maybe that's just her way
of getting you to pay attention to her.

581
00:28:11,346 --> 00:28:12,493
I don't wanna
pay attention to her.

582
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:13,820
I want her to pay attention to me.

583
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:15,741
- Okay.
- That's how I'm used to it.

584
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:16,813
If you like her...

585
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:18,943
maybe you should
get used to a new way.

586
00:28:20,628 --> 00:28:22,382
Wait, seriously,
Denny blew out his knee?

587
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:28,420
Yeah, baby!
Yeah!

588
00:28:28,428 --> 00:28:30,563
I never thought
I'd be rooting for Buckley.

589
00:28:32,065 --> 00:28:33,641
- Buddy Garrity.
- Yes, Ma'am.

590
00:28:34,096 --> 00:28:36,261
I'm sorry, it was just on,
I swear.

591
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:38,361
- You promised.
- No, I know--I'm here.

592
00:28:38,995 --> 00:28:40,031
Hey, I'll be back.

593
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:41,993
Would you come on now?

594
00:28:41,995 --> 00:28:43,010
You're with me, Buddy.

595
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:43,982
Thanks.

596
00:28:48,536 --> 00:28:49,590
Hey, Mom,

597
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:51,651
did you ever think
of moving out of Dillon?

598
00:28:53,255 --> 00:28:55,883
I did leave Dillon.
I moved to Dallas when I was 18.

599
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:58,070
So then what happened--I mean,
why'd you leave?

600
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,962
I fell in love with your father.

601
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:02,980
I came up here to visit and

602
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:05,433
he wouldn't go to Dallas, so...
You never know.

603
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:06,672
Can I talk to you for a minute?

604
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:13,561
Just one second.

605
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:14,420
One second.

606
00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:15,662
Just for a minute.

607
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:16,632
No drama.

608
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:17,831
Just for a minute, please.

609
00:29:17,836 --> 00:29:20,222
I can't explain this to her
anymore, I can't.

610
00:29:20,516 --> 00:29:23,120
This was too much, Bob.
It was too much.

611
00:29:46,956 --> 00:29:48,731
- You ready for this?
- Yep.

612
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:51,001
Let's go.

613
00:30:09,197 --> 00:30:11,461
Tyra, people have fights.

614
00:30:12,597 --> 00:30:13,812
People do have fights.

615
00:30:14,415 --> 00:30:15,931
They don't
have fights every day.

616
00:30:17,928 --> 00:30:19,902
They don't let men
beat the hell out of them.

617
00:30:21,568 --> 00:30:23,543
Don't look at me
like that, honey.

618
00:30:25,987 --> 00:30:26,992
Mom,

619
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:30,892
you know, I love you more
than anything in this world.

620
00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:32,901
So much.

621
00:30:33,847 --> 00:30:35,970
You're an amazing woman

622
00:30:35,978 --> 00:30:37,571
and you are a damn good mother.

623
00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:42,191
But God, you are such a loser

624
00:30:42,195 --> 00:30:43,470
when it comes to men.

625
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:48,130
You're gonna let that man
back into our house

626
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,251
and I will not accept it.

627
00:30:49,378 --> 00:30:50,170
Well,

628
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:53,023
- it is not your decision.
- I'm making it my decision.

629
00:30:54,677 --> 00:30:57,083
I love you too much to watch him
do that to you anymore.

630
00:31:02,438 --> 00:31:03,920
He comes back,
I'm moving out.

631
00:31:04,217 --> 00:31:06,611
- Oh, Tyra, don't be silly--
- I'm serious.

632
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:10,242
It's him or me.

633
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:12,421
You choose.

634
00:31:22,016 --> 00:31:23,783
I could so take that guy.

635
00:31:27,766 --> 00:31:28,833
So, uh,

636
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:30,783
how'd you like that concert at UT?

637
00:31:31,047 --> 00:31:32,543
Concert at UT?

638
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:33,352
Yeah.

639
00:31:34,446 --> 00:31:36,513
Oh, you mean the one
I went to with Matt and Julie.

640
00:31:36,606 --> 00:31:37,670
Yeah, that one.

641
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:39,450
Come on, man.
Keep your feet solid!

642
00:31:40,397 --> 00:31:42,400
Okay, who'd you say you saw
perform at the concert?

643
00:31:44,156 --> 00:31:46,563
It was, uh, this band.

644
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,000
What were they called?

645
00:31:52,315 --> 00:31:53,433
Do you even know?

646
00:31:54,035 --> 00:31:55,373
I mean, was it a band?

647
00:31:55,377 --> 00:31:57,332
Or was it a man?

648
00:31:57,336 --> 00:31:59,963
Or was it a woman?
Was it a symphony orchestra?

649
00:32:02,426 --> 00:32:04,062
Do you ever hang out
with Matt and Julie?

650
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:05,433
I...

651
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:08,703
You got 'em to lie to me?

652
00:32:09,198 --> 00:32:10,781
It's your own damn fault.

653
00:32:11,107 --> 00:32:13,442
You can't even see
what's right in front of you.

654
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:15,132
I'm Smash.

655
00:32:17,738 --> 00:32:21,152
Who wants to see me take on
this sorry ass arm wrestling champ?

656
00:32:22,497 --> 00:32:24,021
That's right.
Yeah.

657
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,532
I got five on it, baby.

658
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:26,882
That's all you do is talk.

659
00:32:26,885 --> 00:32:28,352
Come on, baby, let's go.

660
00:32:28,356 --> 00:32:30,063
Come on, baby, let's go.

661
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,441
Hey.

662
00:32:43,258 --> 00:32:44,391
You okay?

663
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:47,242
Not really.

664
00:32:52,716 --> 00:32:54,182
What's wrong?

665
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:56,762
My mom's gonna be an idiot

666
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,842
and let that jerk
back into our house.

667
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:00,332
I'm sorry.

668
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:05,262
There's a trait in the women in my family
that just drives men crazy.

669
00:33:08,728 --> 00:33:10,903
They treat us like crap
and always come back for more.

670
00:33:13,268 --> 00:33:14,742
That's, uh...

671
00:33:16,117 --> 00:33:18,283
That's actually what I was
here to talk to you about.

672
00:33:21,745 --> 00:33:23,413
I am truly sorry.

673
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,913
For everything
that has happened.

674
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:27,453
For what
I've put you through.

675
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:30,022
Everything that happened with Lyla.

676
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:33,980
I was a complete jerk
and I am so sorry.

677
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:42,531
If you would even consider
giving me a second chance, Tyra,

678
00:33:42,537 --> 00:33:45,363
believe me, it'll be so different.

679
00:33:48,497 --> 00:33:49,520
Sorry.

680
00:33:51,518 --> 00:33:55,063
You know, so many times,
I would have loved...

681
00:33:56,107 --> 00:33:58,591
to hear those words
come out of your mouth.

682
00:34:00,397 --> 00:34:02,490
God, I'd love to say yes.

683
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:06,521
But I'd hate myself for it.

684
00:34:07,157 --> 00:34:09,133
I'd be a hypocrite, you know?

685
00:34:12,578 --> 00:34:14,740
I guess timing's everything.

686
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:31,283
That's what I'm talkin' about!

687
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:33,142
The Smash, baby!

688
00:35:25,608 --> 00:35:28,280
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
our first cowboy out tonight--</i>

689
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,840
<i>And, ladies and gentlemen,
here's a little treat for you.</i>

690
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:33,152
<i>...has blocked the kick!
They've got the ball!</i>

691
00:35:33,155 --> 00:35:34,153
<i>No one in front of him</i>

692
00:35:34,538 --> 00:35:35,842
<i>Across mid-field!</i>

693
00:35:35,997 --> 00:35:38,911
<i>He's gonna score!
He's gonna score!</i>

694
00:35:39,516 --> 00:35:41,222
<i>The 20, the 10!</i>

695
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:43,093
<i>Touchdown!</i>

696
00:35:45,265 --> 00:35:47,273
<i>Panthers fans, get ready!
We're going to the playoffs!</i>

697
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:29,191
Comin' for
to carry me home

698
00:36:30,586 --> 00:36:33,280
Thank you, Lord,
for letting Buckley win.

699
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:36,541
I know that it was nothing
short of a miracle.

700
00:36:36,706 --> 00:36:38,602
And I thank you
for that miracle.

701
00:36:39,336 --> 00:36:40,770
I know you truly are

702
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:41,940
an all-powerful God

703
00:36:41,946 --> 00:36:43,450
to let such a crap team win.

704
00:36:44,117 --> 00:36:45,831
I know I've sinned,
but I have to ask

705
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:46,711
for one more thing.

706
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:49,652
And I know that you know
what it is before I ask for it.

707
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,020
The playoffs.

708
00:36:53,508 --> 00:36:54,583
State.

709
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,801
If it's your will, let us win State,
dear God.

710
00:36:59,398 --> 00:37:00,660
In Jesus' name.

711
00:37:01,946 --> 00:37:03,111
Amen.

712
00:37:21,478 --> 00:37:22,350
Coach.

713
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:28,663
Listen.

714
00:37:29,586 --> 00:37:31,820
I just came out here
to let you know...

715
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:37,070
that no matter
what anyone says,

716
00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:39,140
no matter what happens
with this whole lawsuit thing,

717
00:37:39,148 --> 00:37:40,693
just know that it was...

718
00:37:41,448 --> 00:37:43,410
it was not in my hands.

719
00:37:45,317 --> 00:37:47,203
And I was against it.

720
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,930
And that you'll always
be my coach.

721
00:38:10,186 --> 00:38:11,700
Hey, Dad!

722
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:13,492
How's it goin'?

723
00:38:13,495 --> 00:38:15,453
Goin' good.
How you doin'?

724
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:17,621
Can I interest you in a Malibu?

725
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:19,862
Uh, yeah,
I wouldn't mind one.

726
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:23,581
Um...

727
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:25,692
Look...

728
00:38:26,696 --> 00:38:28,770
I know that you hate it here.

729
00:38:29,315 --> 00:38:32,543
It's kind of obvious in the mornings
when you're getting dressed.

730
00:38:32,547 --> 00:38:35,513
And you're putting on the Buddy Garrity
American flag pin.

731
00:38:35,517 --> 00:38:38,090
- I'll get used to it.
- I don't think you need to.

732
00:38:39,388 --> 00:38:41,602
I can keep taking care of grandma
and going to school,

733
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:43,293
it's okay.
No, really, Dad.

734
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:46,141
She's been
doing really well lately and...

735
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:47,333
Look, you

736
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:48,680
can go back to Iraq.

737
00:38:48,688 --> 00:38:50,362
I know how much it means

738
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:52,651
to you to be there.
And it means so much to me

739
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,412
that you wanted to stay here.

740
00:38:54,426 --> 00:38:56,470
But it's okay.

741
00:38:57,617 --> 00:38:59,192
I don't know
if I can agree to that.

742
00:38:59,195 --> 00:39:03,481
- You can have no legal guardian.
- Dad, I don't know that I can let you not agree to that.

743
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:12,502
Not really
much of a car salesman, am I?

744
00:39:12,505 --> 00:39:14,573
Yeah, but you're
a really good soldier.

745
00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:16,253
Sometimes
that doesn't mean much.

746
00:39:16,256 --> 00:39:17,632
Yeah, well,

747
00:39:17,636 --> 00:39:19,672
sometimes it does.

748
00:39:29,945 --> 00:39:31,610
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

749
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:33,420
I told you, it was him or me.

750
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:35,911
I wasn't kidding.

751
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,540
Tyra,

752
00:39:40,626 --> 00:39:44,692
did you really think that
I would choose a man over my daughter?

753
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:50,460
Well, I wouldn't.

754
00:40:22,608 --> 00:40:25,232
I'm sorry about last night.

755
00:40:25,616 --> 00:40:29,540
I'm sorry that I got
Matt and Julie to lie for me.

756
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:33,043
They feel bad, you're pissed.

757
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:35,301
And it's all my fault.

758
00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:39,080
And I'm truly sorry
about that.

759
00:40:39,276 --> 00:40:42,772
- Yeah, me too.
- There's something else I gotta say.

760
00:40:44,197 --> 00:40:47,180
Yeah, I like myself.

761
00:40:48,428 --> 00:40:50,600
And I love football.

762
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:53,603
I love it.

763
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,662
I love the game.

764
00:40:57,235 --> 00:41:00,403
I love the crowds.
I love the attention.

765
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:04,483
I love being a star.

766
00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:06,472
I can't help it.

767
00:41:06,475 --> 00:41:09,523
It's a beautiful thing. It's just who I am.
It's how God made me.

768
00:41:11,816 --> 00:41:13,542
I like you a lot, Waverly.

769
00:41:14,647 --> 00:41:16,470
I mean...

770
00:41:16,695 --> 00:41:19,353
more than I've ever liked
any other girl.

771
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:22,272
But...

772
00:41:22,528 --> 00:41:24,933
if you don't like me
for me...

773
00:41:25,998 --> 00:41:28,832
then I gotta live with it.
'Cause I can't be nobody but the Smash.

774
00:41:31,245 --> 00:41:34,813
And yes, I like talking
about myself in the third person.

775
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:39,781
Something tells me
deep down inside you like it too.

776
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:51,392
I'll see you around, Smash.

777
00:42:17,705 --> 00:42:19,981
<i>Sometimes the problem is
that what's gonna happen</i>

778
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,723
<i>just isn't up to you.</i>

779
00:42:21,726 --> 00:42:24,100
<i>Then fate takes a turnaround
to the backyard</i>

780
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:26,510
<i>and suddenly it is all up to you.</i>

781
00:42:27,515 --> 00:42:29,183
<i>Brace yourself, Dillon.</i>

782
00:42:29,226 --> 00:42:31,642
<i>We're going into a hell of a game.</i>
