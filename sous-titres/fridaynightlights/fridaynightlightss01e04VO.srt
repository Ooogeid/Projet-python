1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,400
Grandma's going through one of
her good spells right now.

2
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:06,567
So that's-- that's good.

3
00:00:06,797 --> 00:00:10,500
But I keep hearing that like they're
trying to bring in this Katrina refugee.

4
00:00:10,716 --> 00:00:12,211
This quarterback
from New Orleans.

5
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:14,402
We got ourselves
a quarterback, coach.

6
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:18,617
Welcome aboard, son.

7
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:21,300
If I get in that car right now,
I'm never coming back. Do you understand?

8
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:22,083
I get it.

9
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:24,290
My legs are never
gonna get better!

10
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:25,500
Football, over.

11
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:27,405
You and me, we're not
getting married.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,117
Don't say that, Jason.

13
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:30,657
Lyla, get out!

14
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:31,963
What is wrong with you?

15
00:00:32,285 --> 00:00:35,200
Jason is in the hospital
and you won't even go and see him.

16
00:00:35,677 --> 00:00:37,043
Why don't you go and see him?

17
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:40,602
He's never gonna walk again.

18
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:07,202
<i>Oh, oh--that is nasty.</i>

19
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:08,411
God help me.
That's disgusting!

20
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:09,503
Hey, Julie.

21
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,132
You finally came
to one of our parties.

22
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:12,992
Yeah.

23
00:01:13,277 --> 00:01:14,082
And if you'll excuse me,

24
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:16,041
I'm gonna go see if vomit
comes out of suede.

25
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:19,823
Hey, good luck.

26
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:31,501
Tim Riggins has been gawking
at us all night.

27
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:32,872
I don't think he's--

28
00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:35,342
I always suspected
he was into me.

29
00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:35,772
Oh...

30
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:40,801
Word on the street
is he totally dumped Tyra.

31
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:48,563
<i>What's up, man?</i>

32
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:50,200
<i>What up, Voodoo?</i>

33
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:51,641
<i>Voodoo!</i>

34
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:57,571
Have you Googled that guy?

35
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:58,741
What?

36
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:00,401
He won State last year
in Louisiana.

37
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:02,272
Broke like five school records.

38
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:03,953
You're history, Saracen.

39
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:07,281
But you and your girlfriend
have a nice night.

40
00:02:07,656 --> 00:02:09,132
He's a nice guy.

41
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:10,622
Yeah, he's the best.

42
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:25,301
Hey, who changed my tune?

43
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:27,312
Hey, Doo-Doo.

44
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:30,073
What the hell you think
you're doing, man?

45
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,563
Seriously, son.

46
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:33,780
You gotta climb
some trees, brother.

47
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:35,323
Touch something.

48
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:40,143
You ever touch me again...

49
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:42,592
I'll break your fingers.

50
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,001
Friday Night Lights
104 - Who's Your Daddy

51
00:03:40,347 --> 00:03:40,981
All right, let's go!

52
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:45,160
<i>Let's do it, let's do it!</i>

53
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,530
<i>Let's do it, let's do it!</i>

54
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:53,532
<i>Now, everybody knows
that the Dillon Panthers</i>

55
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:57,380
<i>and the Arnett Mead Tigers have
been rivals for a long time.</i>

56
00:03:57,777 --> 00:04:00,581
<i>So we are looking forward
to another great football game.</i>

57
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:03,012
<i>And to make it
even more interesting,</i>

58
00:04:03,238 --> 00:04:04,820
<i>we've got a little
wager going here.</i>

59
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:07,040
<i>Winner takes all.
Isn't that right, Mayor?</i>

60
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,713
<i>"All" being Sally here.</i>

61
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:13,461
<i>Now, Sally is mine.
My prize heifer.</i>

62
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:18,002
Um, honey, when are you
gonna be able to get home on Friday,

63
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,501
- what time?
- Friday?

64
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:21,341
We've got a scrimmage,
so I don't know.

65
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:22,652
It'll end when it ends.

66
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:29,912
I'll be in the car.

67
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:32,211
Hey!

68
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:34,940
What?
What did I do now?

69
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:38,302
Honey, Friday is her dance recital.
You know that.

70
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:39,160
Damn. I--I know.

71
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:41,100
And you know
they plan those things

72
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,802
on bye weeks just so
maybe somebody'll show up.

73
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:44,173
I understand that.

74
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:47,301
- I just messed up the dates a bit.
- All right, I love you. Bye.

75
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:49,503
- Tell Julie--
- I'll tell her.

76
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:50,802
I don't want her mad at me.

77
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,381
One, two, three.

78
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,522
There you go.

79
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:03,711
Hey, when you're done
putting the newbie

80
00:05:03,827 --> 00:05:05,671
in that gay wheelchair
let me know.

81
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:07,543
You are talking
to a gay man, Herc.

82
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,220
I don't mean "gay"
as in "homosexual".

83
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:10,543
I mean "gay"
as in "retarded."

84
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:12,171
Maybe I have
a retarded son.

85
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:13,370
Is he gay?

86
00:05:13,655 --> 00:05:14,591
I'm joking.

87
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:17,201
Though there can be a genetic
component to homosexuality.

88
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,731
Watch the Discovery Channel, Phil.

89
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,202
When you're done,

90
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:22,373
the bench press on the floor gym
is busted again.

91
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:24,201
I need a walkie
to help me fix it.

92
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:25,520
Welcome to paradise, kid.

93
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:29,512
Who the hell was that?

94
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:32,332
Your roommate.

95
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:53,501
Rivalry.

96
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:56,711
Tradition.

97
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:02,803
Bring that knee up to your chest
as far up as it'll...

98
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:06,902
Okay, Grandma, I'm going to school
to talk to Dad.

99
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:08,662
Any messages
you want me to give him?

100
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:09,501
Mmm.
Thank you, honey.

101
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,843
Oh, is he coming over
for dinner tonight?

102
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:15,612
Um, I'll ask him.

103
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:20,180
Be sure he's taking
his vitamins.

104
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:23,360
I will.

105
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:26,551
You be sure to take
your pills, okay?

106
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:28,562
- I love you.
- Mm-hmm, I love you too.

107
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:30,582
- Have a good day.
- All right, sweetie.

108
00:06:36,737 --> 00:06:37,630
<i>Hey, boy, how you doing?</i>

109
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,201
Doing good. I'm doing good.
How you doing?

110
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:41,662
<i>Well, I'm hanging in here, man.</i>

111
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:42,992
Pretty hot.

112
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:44,183
Yeah.

113
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:45,670
<i>You get to play this week?</i>

114
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:46,951
I did. I started.

115
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:47,790
<i>Very good.</i>

116
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:50,200
Yeah, it was my first start.
We didn't win, but--

117
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:52,261
<i>Oh, that's all right.
You got to start, though.</i>

118
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:54,291
I threw pretty well.
I hit my receivers pretty well.

119
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:57,203
So what about next week?
You gonna start again?

120
00:06:58,147 --> 00:06:58,910
Well, I--

121
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:01,612
We'll have to see, 'cause...

122
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,611
we got--we got
this new quarterback.

123
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:06,390
He's supposedly, like,
this big star from Louisiana.

124
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:07,353
Is that right?

125
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:11,400
Yeah, but we'll just have to wait
and see what Coach decides. You know, so...

126
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,000
Well, I guess it takes
the pressure off, don't it?

127
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:18,072
Yeah. Yeah, Dad.

128
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:21,903
I guess.

129
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,740
Jason, try and take
a bite of food, okay?

130
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:28,943
I'm really not hungry.

131
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:30,330
That's all right.

132
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:32,293
I just want you
to try to use your hands.

133
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:35,783
Well, I can't...
use my hands, all right?

134
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:37,551
Yeah, Jason, you can.

135
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,002
You know, you're gonna get
the use of your hands back.

136
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,322
Not everybody around here
can say that,

137
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:44,770
so you're gonna
have to work at it.

138
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:46,923
And you're gonna have to try.

139
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:49,032
I'm really feeling
tired right now,

140
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:50,403
and I'd like to lay down.

141
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:52,211
Jason, I know you're tired.

142
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:53,950
But if you work at it,

143
00:07:54,118 --> 00:07:56,410
you're gonna get to be
able to do almost everything

144
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:58,205
that you were able to do
before your accident.

145
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,667
Look, I'm not hungry,
and I'm tired,

146
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:01,987
and I'd just like
to lay down.

147
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:03,102
He said he's tired.

148
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:04,763
Why don't you let him rest?

149
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:15,032
Hey, babe.

150
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:16,732
Hey.

151
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:22,001
Listen, I know you'll do it
when you're ready, Jason, but

152
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:23,402
you do have to eat.

153
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:26,332
All right?
Let me help you.

154
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:30,823
Come on.
Come on, babe.

155
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:35,332
There you go.

156
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:38,732
Hey, y'all.
This is Corey.

157
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,230
Ah, the girlfriend.

158
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:44,740
Hi.

159
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:48,502
It's all right.
You can shake it. I won't bite.

160
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:50,323
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

161
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,753
Hey, Herc, you want
to get out of my food?

162
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:53,513
Excuse me.

163
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:54,911
Don't worry.

164
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,090
He ain't gonna be
eating any of it soon.

165
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:01,820
Yo, Corey,
we're out of here.

166
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:03,861
Later on, Sparky.

167
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:06,492
I've gotta get out of this room.

168
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:11,110
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

169
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:13,563
<i>One, track, two.</i>

170
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:15,791
<i>Around.</i>

171
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:17,551
<i>Sharp. Eight.</i>

172
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:22,501
<i>And big. Hit, hit, hit!
Big, big again. Bigger.</i>

173
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:24,561
<i>Boom! And hit, hit, hit.</i>

174
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:25,961
<i>In, out, in,out.</i>

175
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:26,960
<i>Hit.</i>

176
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:30,053
<i> Good. Good job, y'all.
</i>

177
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:37,871
Let's go.
Bring it in, get in here.

178
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:40,163
Come on, let's hustle up now.

179
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:52,711
I gotta tell y'all something.

180
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:55,180
I'm pissed at these boys
from Arnett Mead.

181
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:56,961
I know you're pissed, too,

182
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,721
but let's get one thing
straight right now.

183
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:00,430
This ends here.

184
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:04,401
There's not gonna be any retaliation.
There's gonna be no getting back.

185
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:06,373
Rivalry week ends now.

186
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:07,841
Tell you what we are gonna do.

187
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:12,503
We're gonna take this energy we have,
and we're gonna take this anger that we have

188
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:16,800
and we are gonna use it to kick their ass
where it counts... on the field.

189
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:18,783
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

190
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:20,741
- Who are we?
- Dillon Panthers!

191
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:22,703
- Who are we?
- Dillon Panthers!

192
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:24,181
All right, let's have
a good practice now.

193
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:27,763
Hey, where's Voodoo?

194
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:29,421
I don't know, Saracen.

195
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:31,130
He's probably jerking around

196
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:33,242
in front of a full-length
mirror right now.

197
00:10:38,297 --> 00:10:39,060
<i>Get off the ball.</i>

198
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:40,300
<i>Get your heads in the game, boys,</i>

199
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:41,233
<i>Get your heads in the game!</i>

200
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,083
<i> Beware. Watch 'em coming in.</i>

201
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:45,552
<i>29!</i>

202
00:10:46,158 --> 00:10:46,902
29!

203
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,160
Hut!

204
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:49,931
Get up there!

205
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:58,082
Hey.

206
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:02,840
<i>Let's go.
Bring it in, bring it in.</i>

207
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:10,293
H ey.

208
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,713
Practice starts at 4:00.

209
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:14,993
I want you here at 4:00.
You hear me?

210
00:11:17,238 --> 00:11:17,810
Hey!

211
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:21,971
You hear what I said?

212
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:29,073
I hate him.

213
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:30,950
Hate him.

214
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:32,043
<i>All right,
let's huddle up, guys.</i>

215
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:32,772
<i>Bring it in.</i>

216
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:36,683
All right, let's go, baby.
Get off the ball now.

217
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:37,440
<i>Let's go.</i>

218
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,760
Set! Red eight!
Red eight!

219
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,412
Hut!

220
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,101
Pretty good.

221
00:12:13,937 --> 00:12:14,581
<i>There it is.</i>

222
00:12:14,787 --> 00:12:15,751
<i>There it is, it worked.</i>

223
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,093
<i>He just looks good every time.</i>

224
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:19,980
Good play.
Hustle back.

225
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:22,041
<i>Good play.
Voodoo, Voodoo.</i>

226
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:24,573
- Let's go!
- Looked good, Coach.

227
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:26,361
He's doing something

228
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,123
with that chance
you gave him, isn't he?

229
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:30,761
I love this boy.

230
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:33,870
Got my Voodoo working.

231
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:36,160
Got that Voodoo working.

232
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,545
Ray, what were you thinking all those days...

233
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,541
when you were entraped 
inside the Superdome,

234
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:47,611
not knowing if you were
gonna live or die?

235
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:49,652
God wasn't gonna let me die.

236
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,750
He told me to war up,
dance with fear.

237
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:53,573
Now you see,

238
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:56,283
I knew that the heavens
had opened up

239
00:12:56,316 --> 00:12:58,700
when this young man
landed here in Dillon

240
00:12:59,038 --> 00:13:01,712
after his family had been
through that devastation

241
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:03,071
with Hurricane Katrina.

242
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:04,691
I mean, I just
thought to myself,

243
00:13:04,978 --> 00:13:08,300
"This just might be our
new starting quarterback."

244
00:13:08,397 --> 00:13:11,771
Now are you saying that Coach Taylor's
given the nod to Voodoo

245
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:13,642
to start next Friday
against the Tigers?

246
00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:15,720
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's not my department.

247
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:18,501
<i>You'll have to talk to
Coach Taylor about that one.</i>

248
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:22,093
What are you pounding
around about?

249
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:24,351
Nothing.
It's just this guy.

250
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:26,762
- Voodoo?
- Well...

251
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:29,422
Don't let Voodoo get
into your mind, babe.

252
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:32,821
I'm not, I just got
a bad feeling about this.

253
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,372
Well, you should play
Matt Saracen.

254
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:35,570
Wish I could play
Matt Saracen,

255
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:36,570
- but I can't play Matt Saracen
- Why not?

256
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:39,800
'cause Matt Saracen's
self-destructing on the field.

257
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:41,602
Are we having
some kind of party?

258
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,952
Hey, monkey noodle,
come here.

259
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:45,070
- How you doing?
- What did you say, sweetie?

260
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:46,900
Some football party?

261
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:51,300
'Cause Lois told me about this party,
and she's definitely the last person

262
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:54,250
in the entire state of Texas
to find out about anything.

263
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:56,890
That sounds just like a vicious rumor to me.

264
00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:58,321
I mean, I can't imagine
we'd be having

265
00:13:58,488 --> 00:13:59,810
any kind of football party.

266
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:02,051
I mean, 'cause if we were having
some kind of a football party,

267
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,623
that would involve food,
and drink,

268
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:06,451
and a lot of advance notice.

269
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:08,771
It's a weekend rivalry.
I didn't know anything about it.

270
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,921
It's a tradition.
Everyone comes over to the coach's house.

271
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:13,033
- When is this?
- A couple days.

272
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:15,252
You mean, like,
Thursday couple days?

273
00:14:15,546 --> 00:14:17,330
All right, for how many
people, sweetie?

274
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:18,633
Just the team.

275
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,403
- Just the team.
Well, I mean, it'll be the team,

276
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:22,802
and it'll probably be
a few others.

277
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,920
- How many people?
- I'll help. It'll be fine.

278
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:26,353
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

279
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:33,701
- Grandma?
- Hmm?

280
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:37,301
Did you forget to take
your pills yesterday?

281
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,890
No, I took 'em.

282
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:42,722
Well, then how come they're sitting
right here where I left 'em?

283
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:44,080
'Cause you're mistaken.

284
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:46,950
I took 'em just like I always do.
You might've made a mistake.

285
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:47,892
Ok.

286
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:50,343
Well, how about, um--

287
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:54,290
Would you mind maybe today
taking 'em while I'm standing here?

288
00:14:57,748 --> 00:14:59,880
Matthew, give me those pills.

289
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:01,061
Give me that juice.

290
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:03,043
Don't take your eyes off my face.

291
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:06,550
Now watch.
Pills.

292
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:10,690
Juice.

293
00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:11,540
Ok.

294
00:15:11,696 --> 00:15:13,531
- Now you go to school.
- Yes, ma'am.

295
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:16,272
Hey, hey, I saw that
game tape of yours again,

296
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:18,402
and I know what your problem
is--it's your feet.

297
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,932
Oh, yeah?
What's wrong with my feet?

298
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:22,422
They're slow.
Slower than molasses.

299
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:24,052
Need to move 'em faster.

300
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:26,081
- All right.
- Let me see you.

301
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:29,442
I'll work on that.

302
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,371
Hey, we need to talk.

303
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:50,163
I've been having these feelings.

304
00:15:50,745 --> 00:15:52,763
Like, a flood of feelings.

305
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:53,521
Me too.

306
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,140
For Jason, Tim.

307
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:57,151
What happened with us

308
00:15:57,337 --> 00:15:59,222
came from all these
feelings about Jason

309
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:01,500
and what he's going through.

310
00:16:01,685 --> 00:16:04,001
I know it doesn't make a lot of sense,
but do you understand?

311
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:04,940
Yeah.

312
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,643
What I'm saying is,

313
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:09,032
I don't feel aything for you, okay?

314
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:12,752
That wasn't even me that night.
That was...

315
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,382
I don't even know who that was.

316
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:17,841
But it will never happen again.

317
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,493
No one can ever know about it,

318
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:20,831
and it meant nothing.

319
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:22,282
Do you understand me, Tim?

320
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:23,451
Yeah.

321
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:27,600
I hate myself for the other night.

322
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:30,082
I just hope I don't go
straight to hell.

323
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:31,531
I really do.

324
00:16:40,436 --> 00:16:41,222
<i>Heads up.</i>

325
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:42,080
<i>Let's go, linemen!</i>

326
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:45,782
<i>Beware, watch 'em coming in.</i>

327
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:48,912
<i>- Get off the ball, linemen.
- Let's go, fire off.</i>

328
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:52,170
<i>Saracen, concentrate.
Get your heads in the game!</i>

329
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:53,190
Hut!

330
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:55,773
<i>For God's sakes, Matt!</i>

331
00:16:56,688 --> 00:16:58,123
<i>Whoa, whoa!</i>

332
00:17:05,427 --> 00:17:06,852
Show me your right hand.

333
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:09,640
Show me your left hand.

334
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:12,582
Well, that's a relief, he knows
his right from his left.

335
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:13,530
<i>Brush with your right,
wipe with your left.</i>

336
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:14,222
Listen to me.

337
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:16,550
90% of this game
is between the ears, son.

338
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:19,301
Mental errors are unacceptable.
You got that?

339
00:17:19,757 --> 00:17:20,713
Play smart.

340
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:24,402
Mom says you're supposed to give me
a head count for the party.

341
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:26,651
- Oh, hey, babe.
- Hey, Reyes, get your head out of your ass

342
00:17:26,737 --> 00:17:27,531
while you're at it.

343
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:29,322
Nice, Dad.
That was very elegant.

344
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:30,271
Head count?

345
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:30,791
Hut!

346
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:33,972
<i>There you go, there you go!</i>

347
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,253
You almost look like
you know what you're doing.

348
00:17:37,197 --> 00:17:37,981
Fifty-ish.

349
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:41,222
Is that more like 50
or more like 100?

350
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:42,723
60, say 60.

351
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:44,282
- All right.
- All right.

352
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:46,050
- Love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too, baby.

353
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:47,701
You have a good day.
Hey, hey!

354
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:50,362
- Sixty-ish.
- Right.

355
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:53,473
Yeah, sixty-ish.
That's good.

356
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:54,532
Play!

357
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:57,162
Son, you're a mess out there.

358
00:17:58,297 --> 00:17:58,803
Yes, sir.

359
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:00,421
You need to get
more focused, son.

360
00:18:01,398 --> 00:18:01,913
Yes, sir.

361
00:18:03,086 --> 00:18:04,930
Now I know what's distracting you.

362
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:06,611
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

363
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:08,393
And I'm gonna
tell you something.

364
00:18:08,476 --> 00:18:09,782
You forget about Voodoo.
You understand me?

365
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:11,403
This is within your reach.

366
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:13,181
But not if you don't
attack the opportunity.

367
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:16,400
I mean, attack the opportunity
every day, every practice.

368
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:17,981
Yeah.

369
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:20,391
You got a girlfriend?

370
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,542
Uh, no, sir.

371
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:25,061
Do you have someone
you're interested in?

372
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:28,983
- Uh...sort of.
- Sort of?

373
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:30,880
Well, forget about sort of.
You know what?

374
00:18:31,065 --> 00:18:32,692
Take her out.
You understand me?

375
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:34,830
- Sir?
- Movies, dinner.

376
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:35,842
Get her in the backseat
of your car.

377
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:37,251
I don't care.
Whatever.

378
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:38,910
But I'm telling you, you need
to get loose out there.

379
00:18:39,028 --> 00:18:40,442
You're wound up tighter
than a rubber band, son.

380
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:41,460
Yes, sir.

381
00:18:42,597 --> 00:18:43,143
Good.

382
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:49,001
So tomorrow, you come to practice
loose and focused.

383
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:53,470
- Loose and focused.
- Yes, sir.

384
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:55,963
Get out of here.

385
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:59,951
Y-yes, sir, sorry.
Thanks, Coach.

386
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:01,452
You're welcome.

387
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:12,552
Hey, Grandma.

388
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:18,550
Grandma?

389
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:25,151
Grandma?

390
00:19:27,745 --> 00:19:28,503
Grandma?

391
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:33,081
Oh, hey, Mrs. Johnson.

392
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:34,330
I'm really sorry to bother you.

393
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:35,271
Have you seen my grandmother?

394
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:36,321
No.

395
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:38,493
Matt, is everything okay?

396
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:41,971
Uh, yeah, I'm sure
everything's fine.

397
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:42,913
Thanks.
I'm really sorry.

398
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,420
- I'm sorry I woke you.
- Well, let me know.

399
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:45,992
I will.

400
00:19:52,596 --> 00:19:53,882
How many do you want, like, seven?

401
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,060
I don't know.

402
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:57,101
I think I've got enough,
sweetie, of the ribs.

403
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:58,830
All right, let's go.
Come on, come on.

404
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:02,623
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, Mrs. Taylor.

405
00:20:02,806 --> 00:20:05,253
Got a big pile
for you here today.

406
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:08,041
Oh, honey, did we get onions?

407
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:09,793
I don't know, that was
on your part of the list.

408
00:20:09,895 --> 00:20:11,451
Well, I can't remember
if I got 'em.

409
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,152
Can you see 'em?
Are they over there?

410
00:20:13,987 --> 00:20:15,762
- Just will you please--
- I'm just gonna go get some more.

411
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:17,821
Will you please?
Thank you. I appreciate that.

412
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:18,812
You're welcome.

413
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:21,132
Put the gum in there, too.

414
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:24,751
Now, if it's all right
with you...

415
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:26,481
- Hey!
- Hey!

416
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:28,702
Looks like rivalry week team
dinner at the coach's house.

417
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:29,631
- That's right.
- Wow.

418
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:31,203
Anything I can bring?

419
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:34,281
Oh, no, I think
I've got it under control.

420
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:35,100
Thank you, sweetie.

421
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:36,880
Well, we'll see you there.

422
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:40,103
Okay. Oh, are y'all coming?
Are the parents coming?

423
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:43,023
- Oh, we wouldn't miss it.
- Oh, great.

424
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:45,213
- Go Panthers!
- Okay, see you then.

425
00:20:45,757 --> 00:20:46,611
- Bye!
- Bye!

426
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:10,182
Wh--what happened?
What happened?

427
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,591
- Matt Saracen?
- Yeah.

428
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:13,982
Looks like she wandered
into a neighbor's house

429
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:14,951
around the block.

430
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,302
They came home
and found her taking a bath.

431
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:19,613
- She's fine?
- Fine. She's all right.

432
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:20,740
Grandma, are you all right?

433
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:22,060
Matt.

434
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:26,232
I'm sorry.

435
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:27,611
Don't be sorry.

436
00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:29,291
I'm so sorry.

437
00:21:34,488 --> 00:21:36,480
Let's go in.
Don't let anybody see me.

438
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:37,352
Okay.

439
00:21:38,578 --> 00:21:40,400
It's all right, you're home now.
You're home.

440
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:42,173
It's okay.

441
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:45,533
Let's go inside.
It's okay.

442
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:52,990
Well, they said it's dementia.

443
00:21:53,516 --> 00:21:54,531
<i>But she's okay now.</i>

444
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:57,221
Well, yeah, I guess.

445
00:21:57,956 --> 00:21:58,392
<i>Good.</i>

446
00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:01,401
<i>Look, son, you're just gonna
have to hold down the fort.</i>

447
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:02,410
<i>I've got my hands full here, Matt.</i>

448
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:06,451
Yeah, well, I'm fine.
She's--

449
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:09,721
She's fine.

450
00:22:09,857 --> 00:22:11,641
She's--she's just Grandma,
you know?

451
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:25,933
Man, I shouldn't be around here
too much longer anyway.

452
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:32,500
I just re-injured myself.
Here for a little tune up.

453
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,582
Another couple weeks,
I should be getting out of here.

454
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:38,521
You, you're here for quite some time.

455
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,503
I hope you get better real soon.

456
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:42,872
Lord have mercy.

457
00:22:42,925 --> 00:22:44,533
Where have you been
all my life?

458
00:22:49,127 --> 00:22:49,721
Hey.

459
00:22:50,715 --> 00:22:51,311
Tyra.

460
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:53,143
Um...

461
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:56,122
Look...

462
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,573
I know we were never
close buddies.

463
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:02,272
And I can only imagine
the load of fake crap

464
00:23:02,335 --> 00:23:03,551
that you've had to put up
with from people

465
00:23:03,628 --> 00:23:04,463
you hardly even know,

466
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:07,461
and I am so not doing that.

467
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:14,451
I just, um...I came by to tell you how sorry
I am that Tim hasn't been in to see you.

468
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:16,452
He wants to.

469
00:23:16,548 --> 00:23:18,630
Although, you know,
we won't admit it.

470
00:23:18,985 --> 00:23:20,653
But he just can't do it.

471
00:23:21,345 --> 00:23:22,420
Yeah, why is that?

472
00:23:23,637 --> 00:23:24,802
He's scared.

473
00:23:25,407 --> 00:23:26,430
Oh, he's scared?

474
00:23:28,595 --> 00:23:29,950
Yeah, well, that's Tim for you.

475
00:23:32,476 --> 00:23:33,502
It sure is.

476
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,242
- Well...
- Well...

477
00:23:39,495 --> 00:23:40,393
Thanks for coming.

478
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:42,253
Yeah, yeah.

479
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:46,600
And you tell Tim whenever
he's ready he can come on by.

480
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:48,270
Jason...

481
00:23:50,585 --> 00:23:51,332
I'm really sorry.

482
00:23:54,077 --> 00:23:55,070
No, I mean...

483
00:23:57,286 --> 00:24:00,182
Something like this shouldn't happen
to a good person like you.

484
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:11,081
- Thank you.
- Bye.

485
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,283
Who in the hell was that?

486
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,593
That's Tyra.

487
00:24:20,548 --> 00:24:21,240
Hey! Sparky.

488
00:24:23,486 --> 00:24:24,592
Come on, line, get off the ball.

489
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:25,972
Give him some protection.
Let's go.

490
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:27,933
All right,
86 change.

491
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:38,683
<i>Blue 25! Blue 25!!</i>

492
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:40,452
<i>Hut!</i>

493
00:24:46,056 --> 00:24:47,061
There it is. Good run.

494
00:24:52,615 --> 00:24:53,721
<i>Huddle up, come on.
Let's go!</i>

495
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:55,012
<i>Huddle up. Geti it up,
Get it up.</i>

496
00:24:55,548 --> 00:24:56,170
<i>Let's go!</i>

497
00:24:57,468 --> 00:24:58,283
Let's go.

498
00:24:59,757 --> 00:25:01,480
Hey, y'all, how are you?

499
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:03,030
Come on in. Good to see you.

500
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:05,411
<i>Come on in. Welcome, welcome.</i>

501
00:25:05,735 --> 00:25:07,521
Hey, how are you? Oh.

502
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:08,402
Hey!

503
00:25:09,016 --> 00:25:10,040
Girls, I--

504
00:25:10,528 --> 00:25:12,151
It is so good to see you again.

505
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,282
You too.

506
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:15,070
Great to see you there.

507
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,512
Honey, go to the market.

508
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:19,983
Buy all the steaks.

509
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:22,601
Buy all the ribs.
Buy--buy all the barbecue sauce.

510
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:23,243
Buy it all.

511
00:25:23,816 --> 00:25:25,063
Sweetie, go now.
Go now.

512
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:42,470
Honey, can you please help me
put some ice in this cooler?

513
00:25:42,596 --> 00:25:43,731
Yeah, just a second.

514
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:45,640
Oh, good.
Honey, where's the ice?

515
00:25:46,456 --> 00:25:46,873
The ice?

516
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,641
The ice I was supposed to pick up?

517
00:25:49,395 --> 00:25:51,450
The ice that you forgot to get.
Get my wallet.

518
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:52,761
I know, I know.
Buy the ice.

519
00:25:53,037 --> 00:25:53,590
Thank you.

520
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:54,751
I'm sorry, honey.

521
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:57,303
You know what? I gotta go smoke
some more meat.

522
00:25:57,725 --> 00:26:02,482
- Hey, I got cranberry juice and caramel apples.
- Oh, good. Fantastic.

523
00:26:02,658 --> 00:26:03,330
Excuse me, sorry.

524
00:26:04,637 --> 00:26:05,991
Hey, Julie. How's it going?

525
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:08,081
Hey, um, it's great.

526
00:26:08,516 --> 00:26:09,491
Really, really great.

527
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:13,733
Okay.

528
00:26:19,318 --> 00:26:22,680
I mean, this Tatom kid can bust
the season wide open for us,

529
00:26:22,756 --> 00:26:25,200
because, I mean, he's got great vision.
He's got great feet.

530
00:26:25,306 --> 00:26:27,402
He runs like a running back.
And he can throw the football.

531
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:30,223
Well, has Coach decided
who's gonna start next week?

532
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:31,181
I don't know.

533
00:26:31,705 --> 00:26:32,833
There he is, right there.

534
00:26:33,316 --> 00:26:34,322
We'll just ask the man.

535
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:35,972
- Coach.
- Hey.

536
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:38,992
Who are you gonna start next week?

537
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,240
Who am I gonna start?
Tell you what, gentlemen.

538
00:26:41,336 --> 00:26:43,493
I'm thinking about revolutionizing
the whole offense.

539
00:26:43,596 --> 00:26:45,701
What I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna get rid of the quarterback,

540
00:26:45,808 --> 00:26:48,100
and I'm gonna have four running backs,
do a hell of a lot of reverses.

541
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:49,172
That's what we're gonna do.

542
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:53,342
What are you doing
down there?

543
00:26:53,457 --> 00:26:54,343
Cleaning up some beer.

544
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:56,961
When you get done, would you help me
try to host up here?

545
00:26:57,106 --> 00:26:59,052
Well, no, actually I think I'm gonna
stay down here for a little while.

546
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:01,240
That man's got a fine jaw line.

547
00:27:01,635 --> 00:27:02,450
Yes, he does.

548
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:07,003
Hey, listen, I got the address
in Arnett Mead.

549
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:10,948
The QB's car is a red '02 Mustang.

550
00:27:10,948 --> 00:27:11,940
We going tonight.

551
00:27:12,348 --> 00:27:15,002
- Where'd you get it?
- I got my ways.

552
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:20,402
- Well, I'm sorry you're upset.
- Well, yeah, I'm upset.

553
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:23,491
Well, you know what?
I should've given you more notice, all right?

554
00:27:23,536 --> 00:27:24,590
But I was a little bit busy.

555
00:27:24,716 --> 00:27:26,470
I know, I know.
Your job is really stressful.

556
00:27:26,585 --> 00:27:28,711
You know what, honey?
I'm doing it, all right?

557
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:32,643
I threw the party for over 100 people
in two days' time.

558
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:35,141
I did it with no help.
And I'm cleaning up

559
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:38,211
after your football stars,
who by the way happen to be pigs.

560
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:40,510
I'm doing it, but I'm not
gonna pretend to like it.

561
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:42,042
Not right now.
Not down here.

562
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,563
When I go back up there,
I'll give you a big smile.

563
00:27:44,627 --> 00:27:47,381
All right, just like I know you need.
But down here, I am pissed.

564
00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:49,200
And I am going to stay down here

565
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:52,510
until I can get back up there
and give you your smile. All right?

566
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,702
When you're done down here,

567
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:58,002
it would be really great
if you'd come up and help me host.

568
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:01,700
Hey, Coach.

569
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:05,393
I know this is kind of not done,

570
00:28:05,698 --> 00:28:07,480
but I was wondering if maybe,

571
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:10,091
off the record,
you could maybe tell me

572
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:12,113
who you're thinking about
on the game on Friday,

573
00:28:12,286 --> 00:28:13,450
who you're thinking about
starting at quarterback--

574
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:15,780
Seriously, you know who I'm gonna start?
I'm gonna start who I have to start.

575
00:28:15,838 --> 00:28:17,650
If you want it to be you,
you're gonna have to show me a lot more

576
00:28:17,757 --> 00:28:19,911
than what you've been showing me on the field
this week, all right?

577
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:25,940
Hey, you need to be take
a deep breath and calm down

578
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:29,720
before you go out there and you say something
that you're not gonna be able to take back.

579
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:32,430
Something like what it's really like
to be the wife of the Panthers coach?

580
00:28:32,506 --> 00:28:34,222
- Like sometimes I hate it? Like right now?
- Hey, let me tell you something.

581
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:36,381
This is my job.
This is what I do.

582
00:28:36,456 --> 00:28:36,831
It's a job--

583
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:38,001
Oh, my--

584
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,093
What the hell was that?

585
00:28:55,338 --> 00:28:57,181
Hey, QB baby, you coming?

586
00:28:57,597 --> 00:28:58,630
I--I don't think so.

587
00:28:59,286 --> 00:28:59,881
Oh, come on.

588
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:01,292
Later, Bambi!

589
00:29:01,936 --> 00:29:04,703
Saracen, let's go.
You're coming.

590
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,872
Come on, get in the car.
All right.

591
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:07,693
Nice.

592
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:10,343
Oh, yeah.

593
00:29:12,655 --> 00:29:14,553
Last piece of the puzzle,
gentlemen.

594
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:15,723
Let's go.

595
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:27,321
All right he's right there. Come on.
Come on now, let's do this, baby, come on.

596
00:29:28,276 --> 00:29:29,223
All right, let's go.

597
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:34,652
<i>Wait up, wait up, wait up.</i>

598
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:35,733
Let's go, man!

599
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:45,320
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go!

600
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:48,653
QB, get in!

601
00:29:51,977 --> 00:29:52,712
<i>Saracen!</i>

602
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:54,870
<i>Saracen, come on!</i>

603
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:58,433
<i>Saracen!
Saracen, Saracen, now!</i>

604
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,750
Dad, get out here!

605
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:01,921
<i>Saracen!</i>

606
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:04,823
<i>Saracen, get in the car!</i>

607
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,882
<i>get in the car!</i>

608
00:30:10,138 --> 00:30:11,273
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

609
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:16,881
<i>Take this course
and you'll be just fine.</i>

610
00:30:17,756 --> 00:30:19,102
<i>Great job. Thank you.</i>

611
00:30:19,238 --> 00:30:21,783
<i>Hopefully I won't be
seeing you again soon.</i>

612
00:30:21,997 --> 00:30:23,752
- I'll see you in the halls.
- Okay.

613
00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:25,502
Hey, I'm next.

614
00:30:26,136 --> 00:30:26,961
What are you doing here?

615
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:30,190
<i>It's very uncomfortable
sitting out there.</i>

616
00:30:32,056 --> 00:30:34,002
I'm sorry that you're mad at me.

617
00:30:35,077 --> 00:30:35,781
Hmm.

618
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:38,253
I don't--
I'm sorry.

619
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:40,971
I'm not sure that
that counts as an apology.

620
00:30:41,145 --> 00:30:42,893
"I'm sorry
that you're mad at me."

621
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:46,042
I'm not sure that
that's actually officially--

622
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:48,402
- You see what I'm saying?
- All right, come on.

623
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,113
Listen, you know what I got
going on out there.

624
00:30:50,176 --> 00:30:51,590
I've got a very stressful job.

625
00:30:51,676 --> 00:30:53,591
You know, everybody's got
a stressful job.

626
00:30:54,177 --> 00:30:54,760
All right, yeah, but--

627
00:30:55,215 --> 00:30:57,862
Oh, you don't think
I have a stressful job?

628
00:30:58,008 --> 00:31:00,142
No, I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying--

629
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:01,713
- You know what?
- I just am here to apologize

630
00:31:01,836 --> 00:31:02,901
- You know what I would love?
- For the party--

631
00:31:03,055 --> 00:31:07,601
I would love for you to try to talk
to a bunch of confused young kids

632
00:31:07,726 --> 00:31:11,490
who are all hopped up
on hormones and anxiety and stress.

633
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:13,662
Not just, you know,
bark at 'em,

634
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:16,600
or tell 'em where they need to carry the ball
for the next 30 seconds,

635
00:31:16,695 --> 00:31:18,341
but just to really sit down
and talk to 'em.

636
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:19,862
- Okay.
- No, I mean seriously.

637
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:22,652
You sit down and you do that,
and then you get back to me.

638
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:25,762
Next!

639
00:31:26,608 --> 00:31:28,512
Watch out. She's a little
pissed off this afternoon.

640
00:31:40,837 --> 00:31:42,313
Where's that beautiful little girlfriend?

641
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,830
You don't know anything
about my girlfriend,

642
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:48,853
and you don't know
anything about my life. So...

643
00:31:49,265 --> 00:31:51,583
How about we just leave it alone
and you stay out of my face, okay?

644
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:54,822
Actually, I know
everything about your life.

645
00:31:55,887 --> 00:31:57,372
Let me run down
the next two years for you.

646
00:31:57,488 --> 00:32:01,372
See, you're still in the golden,
"everyone rallies around you" phase.

647
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:03,482
Yeah, they'll start to get
bored with that

648
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:06,750
in about six weeks.
And then all the letters and cards

649
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:09,403
and visits and prayers will
die down dramatically.

650
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:10,373
Herc, just shut up.

651
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:13,603
You know, another three months after that,
the girlfriend is gonna tell you all about

652
00:32:13,695 --> 00:32:15,400
how you're different people now.

653
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:17,661
And how you need to find out
who you are apart.

654
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:19,722
That'll be the end of her ass.

655
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:24,652
Then maybe about two months after that,
the lawsuit will be in full swing,

656
00:32:24,726 --> 00:32:27,187
and you will lose people
who mean the world to you.

657
00:32:27,187 --> 00:32:28,510
- Herc, don't--
- So you can pay

658
00:32:28,598 --> 00:32:30,230
for fun things like colostomy bags.

659
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:31,071
Get out of my face.

660
00:32:31,345 --> 00:32:33,103
And about maybe three, maybe
four months after that...

661
00:32:33,176 --> 00:32:35,962
- Get out of my face.
- Your parents will announce...

662
00:32:36,008 --> 00:32:36,551
Shut up.

663
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:37,780
- that the stress of all this..
- Shut up!

664
00:32:37,877 --> 00:32:39,433
has driven such a wedge between them

665
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:41,252
- that they've decided
- Herc, I'm warning you.

666
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:44,503
- to go ahead and get a divorce because--
- Will you shut the hell up?!

667
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:51,523
Good...

668
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,182
I knew you had some fight in you.

669
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:20,511
When I say there will be
no retaliation,

670
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,503
I want you to remember
how you feel right now.

671
00:33:24,645 --> 00:33:25,480
That's ten.

672
00:33:26,786 --> 00:33:29,732
Now, is there anybody
that wants to tell me

673
00:33:30,348 --> 00:33:32,680
who went on this
little raid last night?

674
00:33:32,745 --> 00:33:35,593
We can end this all
right here and right now.

675
00:33:35,856 --> 00:33:37,681
Anybody want to 'fess up?

676
00:33:39,698 --> 00:33:40,920
All right, let's run ten more.

677
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:43,532
- Let's run ten more!
- Let's go!

678
00:33:47,515 --> 00:33:48,701
Whoo, it's hot.

679
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:50,793
Get up there!

680
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,622
Well, look who it is.

681
00:34:17,497 --> 00:34:19,350
Mr. Alamo Freeze himself.

682
00:34:19,778 --> 00:34:21,660
That's a real cute hat
you have on there.

683
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:23,512
Who was with you?

684
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:26,180
Uh...no one.

685
00:34:26,718 --> 00:34:28,183
Heh. No one?

686
00:34:30,307 --> 00:34:31,552
There was no one else.

687
00:34:32,146 --> 00:34:33,151
I, uh...

688
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:34,342
I had the bat.

689
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:36,280
And the crow bar.

690
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:38,853
I--I even drove the car
that I jumped into.

691
00:34:41,476 --> 00:34:42,610
Any of y'all want a Swizzler?

692
00:34:50,747 --> 00:34:52,941
This is what it's gonna
be like on the field.

693
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:01,983
Hey, Coach, can we go
over some special teams sets?

694
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:03,023
Mac, it's gonna have to wait.

695
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:06,473
I've gotta get to my daughter's dance recital,
or Tami's gonna have me neutered.

696
00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:06,991
All right.

697
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:11,711
Coach Taylor.

698
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:15,640
<i>Coach...it's Saracen.</i>

699
00:35:16,685 --> 00:35:17,723
<i>I'm at the hospital.</i>

700
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:21,651
Thank you, sir.

701
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:24,501
I wouldn't get too excited.

702
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,500
You and I are going
to a dance recital.

703
00:35:29,185 --> 00:35:30,161
You want to tell me what happened?

704
00:35:31,225 --> 00:35:32,681
Some of the Tigers players
wanted to know

705
00:35:32,818 --> 00:35:34,392
who trashed the QB's car.

706
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:38,972
Why would they think that
you'd know about that?

707
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:41,313
Because I was there.

708
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,913
Did you name names?

709
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:47,162
No, sir.

710
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:49,840
And with all due respect, sir,

711
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:51,402
I still won't.

712
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:56,640
Look, I'm sorry I put you
on the spot the other night

713
00:35:56,778 --> 00:35:58,422
asking you about
who you're gonna start.

714
00:35:58,605 --> 00:36:00,593
Just seems like the whole
town wants you

715
00:36:01,477 --> 00:36:03,041
to make Tatom QB1.

716
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:06,563
Even feels like my dad expects that.

717
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:09,141
Let me tell you something.

718
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,093
Your dad's not able to see what I see.

719
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:19,041
You're a different kid
than you were two weeks ago.

720
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:21,050
- I am?
- You are.

721
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,142
You may have been
happy sitting on the bench

722
00:36:24,277 --> 00:36:26,003
letting Jason take the pressure.
I don't know.

723
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:27,502
I don't need to know.
But I'll tell you what.

724
00:36:27,657 --> 00:36:29,160
I'm a firm believer
in you can do anything

725
00:36:29,257 --> 00:36:31,402
you put your mind to.
And yourself, you,

726
00:36:31,618 --> 00:36:34,301
I believe you can do anything
you put your mind to.

727
00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:38,302
- You really believe that, sir?
- I do.

728
00:36:41,948 --> 00:36:43,203
Thanks for coming to get me.

729
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:44,803
You're welcome.

730
00:36:53,597 --> 00:36:54,141
Excuse me.

731
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:01,573
Could you scoot down one, please?

732
00:37:01,968 --> 00:37:02,370
Hey.

733
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:05,391
Hi, Matt, how are you?

734
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:08,053
What happened?

735
00:37:14,415 --> 00:37:15,561
Are you all right, Matt?

736
00:37:15,895 --> 00:37:18,003
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

737
00:37:24,106 --> 00:37:25,911
Julie hasn't gone on yet.

738
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:26,953
Okay.

739
00:37:36,457 --> 00:37:37,883
<i>Do you wanna get with me</i>

740
00:37:38,316 --> 00:37:40,433
<i>You'll forget all the rest</i>

741
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:43,043
<i>'Cause ain't no girl out like me</i>

742
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,313
<i>Has got what I got</i>

743
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:49,733
<i>I'm trying to get through</i>

744
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:52,251
<i>I'll show you what to do</i>

745
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:56,641
<i>Boy, I'll make you so, so, so addicted</i>

746
00:37:56,977 --> 00:37:58,100
<i>What I got</i>

747
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:01,070
<i>I got that something
that you want</i>

748
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:03,321
<i>What I got</i>

749
00:38:03,778 --> 00:38:07,352
<i>I got that something
that you dream about</i>

750
00:38:25,577 --> 00:38:26,772
I was wrong.

751
00:38:28,157 --> 00:38:29,392
All right?
I was wrong.

752
00:38:31,156 --> 00:38:32,502
Well, of course you were wrong.

753
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:35,703
I mean, you gave me
no advance warning.

754
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:38,303
- You know, and you just assumed--
- No, not about that.

755
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:40,743
Listen, just what I'm saying is...

756
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:45,251
I know how hard it is
what you do.

757
00:38:45,298 --> 00:38:47,240
I know it's not easy
talking to those kids.

758
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:48,680
I know it's difficult.

759
00:38:49,638 --> 00:38:53,741
And I know my job has put you
through a hell of a lot.

760
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:54,771
I understand that.

761
00:38:56,277 --> 00:38:58,631
I just wanted to make sure
you knew that I'm...

762
00:38:59,248 --> 00:39:01,142
thankful for everything
that you do.

763
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:02,802
And I know you do a hell of a lot.

764
00:39:03,005 --> 00:39:03,920
Thank you.

765
00:39:04,488 --> 00:39:05,061
Friends?

766
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:09,471
Friends?
Friends?

767
00:39:11,075 --> 00:39:12,281
Friends?

768
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:16,261
Mmm. Hey.

769
00:39:16,978 --> 00:39:18,690
Oh, wow.
What happened?

770
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:23,500
Oh, yeah, I just got beat up a little bit.
Just a little.

771
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:26,402
But you were really--
Or that was--

772
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:28,491
I really liked it.

773
00:39:29,005 --> 00:39:30,761
- Thanks.
- The music, too.

774
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:31,722
The music was really cool.

775
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:33,722
I don't know why, but for some reason
it kind of--

776
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:36,772
it kind of reminded me
of this painter that I really like.

777
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:39,453
Uh-huh, which painter would that be?

778
00:39:39,926 --> 00:39:43,000
Uh, this guy, um... Jackson Pollock.

779
00:39:43,156 --> 00:39:44,052
Yeah.

780
00:39:44,557 --> 00:39:45,922
I've heard of him before.

781
00:39:46,115 --> 00:39:46,710
Yeah.

782
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:48,532
You ever seen any
of his stuff?

783
00:39:48,947 --> 00:39:52,622
Some of it, but I don't
really see the connection.

784
00:39:52,896 --> 00:39:53,821
You don't?

785
00:39:54,205 --> 00:39:55,422
Not really.

786
00:39:56,706 --> 00:39:57,411
Yeah.

787
00:39:57,638 --> 00:39:59,643
I gue--I guess it is
kind of stretch, huh?

788
00:39:59,968 --> 00:40:01,092
Maybe a little bit.

789
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:05,953
What?

790
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:08,030
- What, what?
- What?

791
00:40:12,018 --> 00:40:13,300
I think I told that kid

792
00:40:13,418 --> 00:40:15,571
to get our daughter
in the backseat of a car.

793
00:40:16,245 --> 00:40:17,340
Mama, Daddy.

794
00:40:19,478 --> 00:40:22,761
Aah!
You were amazing.

795
00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:23,963
Come here, come here, come here.

796
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:24,842
Thank you, Mom.

797
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:26,003
I can't believe it.

798
00:40:26,397 --> 00:40:29,553
I love you very much. Very much.

799
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:32,933
- Mm-hmm.
- Good job. I love you.

800
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:35,381
Good job, good job.

801
00:40:49,337 --> 00:40:50,530
What are you doing here?

802
00:40:56,686 --> 00:40:57,700
Lyla...

803
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:10,461
My father is right downstairs.

804
00:41:10,557 --> 00:41:11,331
I know.

805
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:14,830
Lyla...

806
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:20,310
I can't...

807
00:41:21,267 --> 00:41:23,690
I can't stop thinking
about you, Lyla.

808
00:41:24,286 --> 00:41:25,132
I can't.

809
00:41:26,156 --> 00:41:26,980
No.

810
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:55,693
<i>This is Slamming Sammy Mead</i>

811
00:41:55,886 --> 00:41:59,082
<i>signing off on the worst kind
of Friday in Dillon, Texas,</i>

812
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:01,341
<i>and that's a Friday without a game.</i>

813
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:04,680
<i>Well, next Friday night,</i>

814
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:06,621
<i>I don't need to tell you, is the biggie.</i>

815
00:42:06,788 --> 00:42:08,141
<i>And I'm not the only one saying</i>

816
00:42:08,265 --> 00:42:10,560
<i>it could be the biggest
game of the season.</i>

817
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:15,602
<i>The moment where this team
either gets past the loss of Jason Street</i>

818
00:42:15,706 --> 00:42:16,681
<i>and moves forward,</i>

819
00:42:17,165 --> 00:42:21,181
<i>or we watch the whole season
crumble right before our eyes.</i>

820
00:42:21,447 --> 00:42:22,723
<i>Now, I gotta believe we'll win</i>

821
00:42:22,798 --> 00:42:25,061
<i>because this town wants
that win so bad.</i>

822
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,073
<i>And didn't Daddy tell us,</i>

823
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:30,153
<i>"Winning goes to the one
who wants it most?"</i>
