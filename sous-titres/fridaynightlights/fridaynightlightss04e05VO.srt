1
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:05,655
We are at a crossroads right now.

2
00:00:06,062 --> 00:00:08,462
You are gonna cut
the tough guy crap.

3
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:12,654
My mother never took me shopping
for a pageant gown, and because of that,

4
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:15,024
I never placed at Miss Texas.

5
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:17,532
Mrs. Saracen?

6
00:00:19,662 --> 00:00:20,962
It's your dad...

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,734
He was killed.

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,870
I'm sorry...

9
00:00:26,912 --> 00:00:28,012
I'm sorry...

10
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:31,934
<i>It's late in the game,
here at East Dillon, folks,</i>

11
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:34,814
<i>and once again, the Lions are going
gently into that good night.</i>

12
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,216
You understand me? Alright?
Let's get some points out of this thing.

13
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:42,091
<i>Down 24,
another short gain for East Dillon.</i>

14
00:00:42,513 --> 00:00:44,734
They know what we're gonna do
before we do it!

15
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:46,486
What do you want me to do?

16
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:48,011
Let's run wildcat.

17
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:51,229
- No, coach said we ain't ready...
- I'm ready, alright?

18
00:00:51,354 --> 00:00:54,594
Let's go out there and get
some of our pride back, some dignity.

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,115
He's gonna kick our asses
all over the state, hope you know that.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,614
Coach can't catch me.

21
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:05,494
Alright guys, we're gonna go with...

22
00:01:05,662 --> 00:01:09,134
No, new play, alright? We're gonna go
with spread texas "a", skinny max.

23
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,359
That's not...

24
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:12,721
Shut up. You get your ass up to X
and makes somes blocks.

25
00:01:12,846 --> 00:01:14,734
Listen, we're going
option right, alright?

26
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,014
- On one, on one, ready?
- Break!

27
00:01:19,876 --> 00:01:21,761
- Red-88!
- Hey, what are you doing?

28
00:01:21,886 --> 00:01:24,854
<i>... coach Taylor's come out
in a Texas spread, ace set.</i>

29
00:01:25,022 --> 00:01:26,574
<i>Cafferty to the outside...</i>

30
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:28,854
<i>There you go,
this could be fun, folks.</i>

31
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:31,774
<i>It's Cafferty on the counter.,
he cuts inside...</i>

32
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,894
<i>Oh, wait a second, folks!
It's a pitch to Vince Howard!</i>

33
00:01:36,182 --> 00:01:37,654
Oh, and he smokes the safety!

34
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:39,614
<i>One man to beat!</i>

35
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:42,894
<i>Oh, my! What a move!
Howard's taking it to the barn, folks!</i>

36
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:46,274
<i>Touchdown, East Dillon!
Touchdown, Dillon!</i>

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,774
<i>My goodness! Vince Howard absolutely
mudholed the free safety.</i>

38
00:01:57,942 --> 00:01:59,894
- Good call, Coach!
- <i>54 yards...</i>

39
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:03,814
<i>The best run from scrimmage all season,
and a helluva reach from Luke Cafferty. </i>

40
00:02:09,073 --> 00:02:10,094
Come here!

41
00:02:10,502 --> 00:02:12,122
Come here!
Who called that play?

42
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:13,643
It happened so fast...

43
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:16,094
- Who called the play?
- I blacked out, coach.

44
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:19,374
- Cafferty, who called the play?
- I don't know who called the play.

45
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:21,171
Who called the play?

46
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,174
Get out there, let's go!

47
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,814
You wanna get some more of that?

48
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:36,026
If you want some more of that,
get the damn ball back.

49
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:36,901
41...

50
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:39,448
- Number? 4-3?
- 4-3.

51
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,503
<i>South Pines back to pass...</i>

52
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:49,116
<i>Vince Howard coming off the edge
on a speed rush!</i>

53
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:51,334
<i>Oh, and he strips him
on the playing side!</i>

54
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:54,277
<i>Ball's on the court,
but who wants it?</i>

55
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:01,694
<i>Oh, Dallas Tinker pounces
on the ball!</i>

56
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:04,054
<i>East Dillon has come up with it.
First down, East Dillon.</i>

57
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:13,894
Listen up!
Hey, I call the play.

58
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:17,112
You understand?
I call the play, you run the play.

59
00:03:17,382 --> 00:03:19,374
- You got that?
- You got it!

60
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:23,094
- Wildcat gun "X" throwback. Understood?
- Wait, you want me to throw it?

61
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:26,232
No, I want you to stand here.
I want to talk about it all night.

62
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:28,793
I want you to hit him
in-stride, you got me?

63
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:30,494
Hit him in-stride.
Let's go!

64
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:33,014
- Let's go!
- Here we go!

65
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:36,073
- Watch this.
- Make it count.

66
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,374
<i>Here we go, folks. Vince Howard
on the wildcat sweep going right.</i>

67
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:45,957
<i>Oh, he pulls out looking backside!</i>

68
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:49,454
<i>Going deep to Cafferty.
A little trickeration. He's wide open!</i>

69
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:51,568
<i>Oh, my!
Pay dirt!</i>

70
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:54,174
<i>Touchdown, East Dillon!
Touchdown, Lions!</i>

71
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,854
<i>Real strong finish to a game
that could not be won, folks.</i>

72
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:07,134
<i>But a monster game
out of Vince Howard,</i>

73
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:10,334
<i>and a little light for a team that's
been stuck in the dark all season.</i>

74
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:16,774
- Listen up!
- Hey!

75
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:20,534
Y'all got nothing to be ashamed of.

76
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:23,952
Y'all got nothing to be ashamed of!
Let's hear it!

77
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:28,374
Listen up now!

78
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,290
Listen up. Y'all do me a favor.
Y'all take a knee real quick.

79
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,014
Most of you know Matt Saracen.

80
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:37,257
Some of you know him
better than others.

81
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:39,982
A few of you have played
with him before.

82
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:42,528
You might have heard that his father

83
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:43,753
passed away.

84
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,447
The funeral's gonna be
in a couple days.

85
00:04:46,572 --> 00:04:50,014
Thought it'd be nice if maybe
we say a word for him and his family.

86
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:51,741
Lance?

87
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:53,364
Bow your heads.

88
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:56,814
Our Father, who art in heaven.

89
00:04:57,392 --> 00:04:58,942
Hallowed be Thy name.

90
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:00,531
Thy kingdom come,

91
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:03,782
Thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in heaven.

92
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:07,522
<i>Hello. This is first sergeant
Henry Saracen in Mosul, Iraq.</i>

93
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:10,344
<i>It's your son.
It's dad, it's me.</i>

94
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,602
<i>I wish you, mom, and you, Matt,</i>

95
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:18,752
<i>Want to wish the two of you
a merry Christmas.</i>

96
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:21,562
You got company.

97
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:29,925
Bad movie night, Matt.
It's not an option.

98
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:36,734
Grandma's sleeping, so keep it down.
I'll make some popcorn for you.

99
00:05:37,194 --> 00:05:38,044
Thanks.

100
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,030
How was the game?

101
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:43,947
It was good.

102
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:46,751
Twinkle toes over here
kicked two points.

103
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:49,326
Twinkle toes?
That is not my nickname.

104
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:52,334
- I think it should be.
- It's golden foot.

105
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,054
I think I like this one, Matt.

106
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,014
A lotta hands.

107
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,160
Yeah, I guess.

108
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,359
What's this?

109
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:08,774
It's just this video that my dad
sent me a couple Christmases ago.

110
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:13,851
<i>Matt, I sent you
something in the mail.</i>

111
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:15,926
<i>Hopefully, by now you got it.</i>

112
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:18,854
- <i>This hat looks dumb.</i>
- 50 bucks.

113
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:23,409
<i>We're doing a good job here.</i>

114
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:24,894
<i>Gonna be out of here soon.</i>

115
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:28,214
<i>So I just wanted
to wish you a merry Christmas.</i>

116
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:32,104
<i>That's good.</i>

117
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:34,213
That's nice.

118
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:42,014
- What do y'all think of this one?
- Is that a hand?

119
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:45,600
- I liked it.
- It's good.

120
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:46,974
Let's go watch the movie.

121
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:56,826

124
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,614
- Hello?
- Hey, did you read the paper today?

125
00:07:56,332 --> 00:07:57,132
Paper?

126
00:07:57,784 --> 00:07:59,094
I don't get a paper, coach.

127
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:02,934
Well, you got your face in the paper
as one of the players of the week.

128
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:05,298
My picture?
How do I look?

129
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:08,334
You look like an idiot.
That's how you look.

130
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:10,334
- Okay.
- <i>Picture looks great.</i>

131
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:11,818
<i>Yeah, but we still lost.</i>

132
00:08:11,943 --> 00:08:14,294
I understand that. It means
you played a hell of a game though.

133
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:17,694
<i>Listen, they want you to come over
for the pancake breakfast.</i>

134
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:21,015
It's at 1:00. They have you speak to,
you know, the little guys,

135
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,734
the pop warner kids and stuff.
You do that?

136
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:27,294
But why is it called called a breakfast?
It's at 1:00. Wouldn't it be a lunch?

137
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:30,214
I don't know why they do that.
That's just what they call it.

138
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:31,838
<i>Can you be there then, right?</i>

139
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:33,374
- I like pancakes.
- <i>Alright.</i>

140
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:35,214
- Good-bye.
- Daddy, we need you now.

141
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:54,743
Hey, mom!

142
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,916
We ain't got no electrics,
no nothing.

143
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:24,489
Come on.

144
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:30,289
I know.

145
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,967
I think the best thing
she could do right now is just quit.

146
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:01,094
I'm serious, that's just wrong.

147
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:05,214
Why the xylophone?
This whole thing is confusing.

148
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:09,334
Shiftless son of a bitch.

149
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:10,376
What?

150
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:12,767
My ex, her dad.

151
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:16,967
Gonna miss her singing again.
Always...

152
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:19,614
gone somewhere.
He never shows up.

153
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:23,669
<i>That was wonderful.</i>

154
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,810
<i>Next up
in the Miss Young Texas pageant,</i>

155
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:28,654
<i>we have Miss Becky Sproles!</i>

156
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:30,992
<i>Of East Dillon.</i>

157
00:10:32,302 --> 00:10:35,809
<i>Miss Becky Sproles will be singing
the song</i> Popular <i>from the musical

158
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:36,984
The Wicked.

159
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:39,467
<i>It's just</i> Wicked.

160
00:10:50,144 --> 00:10:53,614
So you just have to know, Matt,
that what your dad did...

161
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:56,088
What your daddy did was important.

162
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:58,414
I mean, right now
I know it seems real far away,

163
00:10:59,183 --> 00:11:01,054
but we're over there for a reason.

164
00:11:01,222 --> 00:11:03,772
And your daddy knew that.
He was a hero.

165
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:06,534
And that will give you strength.

166
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,893
- Thank you, Mr. Garrity.
- Remember that.

167
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:09,854
I will.

168
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:12,334
- Excuse me.
- I've got some food...

169
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:18,254
Matty, you haven't moved
from that chair in an hour.

170
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,191
I don't really need to.

171
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,683
Everybody just keeps coming up to me.
All I gotta do is say thank you.

172
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,949
And grandma's over there...

173
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,773
He stepped on an I.E.D.

174
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,579
How long do these things go for?

175
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:41,517
You know what?
Screw you, Bull.

176
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:44,092
The pageant goes
for another two days.

177
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:46,290
You know what,
you can still get here.

178
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:48,934
I don't care!
I really don't care

179
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:52,602
if you're hauling pieces
of Jesus' cross back to Bethlehem.

180
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:56,192
You promised her you were gonna be here,
and you are gonna be here.

181
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,724
This is so damn
typical of you, you...

182
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:02,094
Do you have any idea what
you're doing to this girl? Any idea?

183
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:06,266
She was so disappointed. She sang her
heart out, and you didn't hear anything.

184
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,045
That new place
that just opened up by <i>Smitty's</i>...

185
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,172
Excuse me, boys.
Excuse me.

186
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:15,134
It's the telephone for you, Tim.

187
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,769
Really?

188
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:20,334
- Why are you getting a phone call?
- I don't know!

189
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,678
<i>Yeah, I know.
I just...</i>

190
00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:30,104
<i>I tried your cell, at work, so I figured
you must be at Matt Saracen's.</i>

191
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:33,574
What are you doing right now?
I'm at a wake. You know what a wake is?

192
00:12:33,742 --> 00:12:34,942
Yeah, I just...

193
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:36,094
I figured

194
00:12:36,262 --> 00:12:39,214
that you weren't close to the dead guy,
but if you are, sorry, I'll hang up now.

195
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,094
What's the problem? What is it,
the trailer's on fire or what?

196
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:44,863
No, I just...

197
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:49,413
I just wanted to tell you that...

198
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,667
Thanks for coming today.

199
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:54,434
It meant a lot to me.

200
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,680
You're welcome.

201
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,454
You did good, and good luck.
You'll probably win,

202
00:13:04,622 --> 00:13:05,972
<i>so don't blow it.</i>

203
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:09,174
You really think so?

204
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:12,134
Alright, I gotta go.

205
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:16,254
- Thanks, bye.
- <i>I'll see you around.</i>

206
00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:31,482
Wait, so...

207
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,316
your job is, like, to see
the bodies home or something?

208
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:37,374
I'm a recruiter,
mostly here in west Texas.

209
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:39,374
But this is an honor job.

210
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:42,042
- So you didn't even know my dad?
- No.

211
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,814
But I do my best to find out
about every man.

212
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:46,496
Heard he...

213
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:49,162
was quite the joker...
in his unit.

214
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:50,934
A funny guy.

215
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:52,982
- My dad?
- Yeah.

216
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:55,776
He always kept up morale.

217
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,851
Did practical jokes and such.

218
00:13:58,547 --> 00:13:59,574
It's important.

219
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:03,053
Yeah, no, I'm sure it is,
but I'm also sure that wasn't my dad.

220
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:06,894
I bet he was a really good soldier
and all that, but he wasn't a funny guy.

221
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:10,014
He was not funny ever.
So maybe you talked to the wrong people.

222
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,574
Maybe it was another guy
who was the joker, but my dad was not.

223
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:15,164
- I've never seen him smile in his life.
- Excuse me, Matt.

224
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,814
I think someone's...
someone's asking for you.

225
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,832
Yeah, thank you for coming.

226
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:21,854
Are you okay?
I don't know...

227
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:24,614
I don't even understand why they send
this guy. He's never seen my dad

228
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,793
before in his life. We all know
that he was not a very funny...

229
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:29,468
I know. That's why...

230
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,685
the Riggins clan and myself,

231
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:34,955
we're gonna take you
out of here tomorrow night,

232
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,634
away from all the death
and the dying

233
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:40,918
- and the deviled eggs.
- Yeah, fine. Whatever, fine.

234
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:42,543
I just don't want...

235
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:44,468
talk about my dad anymore.

236
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,134
- Hey, Matt.
- Our condolences.

237
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,574
- On behalf of the boosters...
- Are you serious?

238
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:53,196
Excuse me?

239
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:57,494
On behalf of the boosters and the entire
Panther organization, we just...

240
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:02,084
Alright...

241
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:16,002
Wassup Cafferty?

242
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:17,946
I'm running, man.

243
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:23,254
I think he's mad that I'm co-conference
player of the week.

244
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,778
- That's what I'm pissed about.
- See this right here? Look.

245
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:30,334
That's me. That's J.D. McCoy, right there.
But I'm sharing this with this guy.

246
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:33,214
I don't know who he is.
Vince Howard? Do you know him?

247
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:36,774
Come to think of it, I recall spending
a couple hours in jail with this guy.

248
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:40,654
How I got there? Considering my friends
were with me at the time, Kevin and...

249
00:15:40,822 --> 00:15:42,734
what did you say
your name was, J.D. McDick?

250
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:45,716
Look, the cops were there, okay?
We took off. I'm sorry.

251
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:48,254
- You're a jackass.
- What do you want me to do?

252
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:51,094
Get out and beg you?
You want me to do that? I'll do it.

253
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:53,494
We're both sorry.
All right, but...

254
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,214
we're going paintballing
tomorrow night. We want you to come.

255
00:15:56,382 --> 00:15:59,157
- It'll be fun, come on.
- I'll think about it.

256
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:01,854
All right, but right here.
Give it to me.

257
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:05,534
Luke, we'll see you around, man.
We're sorry. Later, bud.

258
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:12,294
- Julie will sit here with you.
- Good idea.

259
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:16,334
- You don't think she'll get hot?
- No, she'll be fine.

260
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:19,852
Julie's with her. She'll be okay.
Don't you worry, okay?

261
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,254
What you've got here
is what we like to call

262
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:24,694
our american hero memorial package.

263
00:16:24,862 --> 00:16:29,094
Now, this comes with your choice
of a mahogany or cherry wood casket.

264
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:31,802
The standard outer burial container.

265
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:35,254
- What's that?
- Well, over time,

266
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:39,022
the caskets themselves deteriorate
in the soil, the moisture.

267
00:16:39,744 --> 00:16:43,094
And since veteran affairs
will be picking up most of the bill,

268
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:46,312
you can honor your father
in a manner he deserves.

269
00:16:46,742 --> 00:16:47,774
Right, thanks.

270
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,207
There's the embalming...

271
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:55,294
- Is my dad here?
- He's being prepared right now.

272
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,042
Do I see him?

273
00:16:58,477 --> 00:16:59,294
I think,

274
00:17:00,137 --> 00:17:03,187
in this case,
a closed casket is most appropriate.

275
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:05,605
Right, right.

276
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:10,254
Actually, if that's okay, can I ask
one question? Sorry to interrupt.

277
00:17:11,436 --> 00:17:15,414
This viewing/visitation day,
use of facilities, use of staff,

278
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,173
day prior. That wouldn't be necessary
if it's a closed casket,

279
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:22,971
so we can get rid of those charges.
That would be great. Thank you.

280
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:25,096
Now see, the rest is laid out.

281
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,173
This is for the funeral
service escort.

282
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:32,214
I don't understand that either.
What does that mean exactly?

283
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:35,063
Those are the cars that will...
for the family, friends.

284
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,361
They have cars.
I mean, we all have cars.

285
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:38,589
Yeah, and...

286
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:41,600
And my grandma's
in the car right now, so...

287
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,659
So can we just sign
whatever this is...

288
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:45,443
Why don't you go on out there?

289
00:17:45,568 --> 00:17:47,974
I can finish up with him.
We're at the end of it anyway.

290
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:49,414
- You go now.
- You sure?

291
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:50,934
Yeah, I think so.

292
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:53,854
- All right, I think this is just...
- Thank you.

293
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:56,414
- You have any questions, call me.
- Yes, sir.

294
00:17:56,801 --> 00:17:58,254
- Thanks.
- I'll be right there.

295
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:02,971
I need to ask you a quick question
with all due respect,

296
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:06,014
does that boy look like
he can pay $9,000 to bury his father?

297
00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:08,214
Veterans affairs will be picking up...

298
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:12,694
Look me in the eye, tell me veterans
affairs will pick up a $9,000 bill.

299
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:16,494
No, not the entire $9,000.

300
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:20,774
- But they do pick up a large portion.
- Okay, we need to start over

301
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,454
from the beginning and quickly.

302
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:24,894
Do you have another listing
you can give me?

303
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,580
Keep your hands to yourself.

304
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,627
We're looking
for old cars like this.

305
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:31,725
- What is this, man?
- Old models, man, all right?

306
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,381
See when they stop making the cars,
they stop making the parts.

307
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:37,809
- So the parts worth more.
- Like a bunch of junk parts in here.

308
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:39,214
You see a new car,

309
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:42,214
think it's sharp, think it's fly,
You need to walk away.

310
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,271
Walk away? Why?

311
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:47,734
- Cause they got that lojack.
- We're in west texas.

312
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:49,254
Ain't nobody got no lojack.

313
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:52,294
You walk away cause half them
new cars got them steering locks.

314
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:54,577
Lojack, what's wrong with you?

315
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,882
I told him his braids too tight.
He don't listen.

316
00:18:57,007 --> 00:18:59,107
- Watch out.
- Watch out, what?

317
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:01,134
Both of you need to shut up.

318
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:02,522
This is school,

319
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:04,294
the more you talk,
the more you miss.

320
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:07,414
and the more likely your bitch asses
are gonna do something stupid.

321
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:12,723
This place where you put the keys in,
it's called a tumbler.

322
00:19:12,848 --> 00:19:15,763
You stick your screwdriver in it,
jiggle it a little bit. Sometimes,

323
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,281
the dashboard might come on.
Sometimes the engine. Don't panic.

324
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:20,406
Be cool

325
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:21,959
and get paid.

326
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:28,708
Most of the times, this ain't an option.
Then you gotta hot box the bitch.

327
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,083
Come in closer.

328
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:31,596
This is the magic.

329
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:34,821
- We're gonna leave in a minute.
- Yeah, all right.

330
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:48,432
That was really nice of your mom.
I appreciate it.

331
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:50,606
She's good in crisis.

332
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:52,894
She's pretty much built for crisis.

333
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:02,113
She's invited you over
for dinner tonight

334
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,063
If you want to come.

335
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:06,536
I said you probably
had family stuff to do but...

336
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:08,694
if you want to get away for an hour,

337
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:10,362
I'd love to see you.

338
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:16,214
Okay, you'll come or...?

339
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,311
Yeah, I'll... okay, I'll come.

340
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:28,682
Are you all right?

341
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,412
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

342
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:35,054
You know, this stuff happens.

343
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,294
Now it's happening to me.
Someday it's gonna happen to you.

344
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:46,598
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

345
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,054
That was a stupid thing to say.

346
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:54,733
It's okay.

347
00:20:56,778 --> 00:20:59,423
So, what time is this dinner?

348
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:06,094
Koala bears,
do you know what they eat?

349
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:07,820
Do you know what they eat?

350
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:10,445
<i>And that's more than enough
for a first down.</i>

351
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,676
<i>That makes it six carries
for 38 yards.</i>

352
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:16,958
<i>I'm not saying this young man's ready
to start, but Brian "Smash" Williams</i>

353
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,254
- <i>is making the most of this blowout.</i>
- Look at him run, look at him go.

354
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:23,049
- How 'bout that?
- Look at y'all...

355
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,320
Hi, sweet girl.

356
00:21:27,148 --> 00:21:28,831
- How you doing?
- Did y'all have fun?

357
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,206
It's almost time for a nap for you.

358
00:21:31,618 --> 00:21:32,718
How'd it go?

359
00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:35,295
It went...
Somebody ready for a nap?

360
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,215
Maybe we'll both
lie down together for a nap.

361
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,690
Here, here, here.

362
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:42,591
Take that with you.

363
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:45,744
All right.

364
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:56,814
How's he holding up?

365
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:04,252
He's trying.

366
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,666
I'm not going anywhere.

367
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:46,414
- Who's your favorite football player?
- You heard of Johnny Unitas?

368
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:48,893
My old coach used to tell me
about Johnny Unitas.

369
00:22:49,018 --> 00:22:50,818
I remind him a lot of him.

370
00:22:51,265 --> 00:22:54,516
See that old man in the back,
one of the oldest guys in this room?

371
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:56,926
That's my dad.

372
00:22:57,555 --> 00:22:58,854
He taught me everything.

373
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,703
You gotta be fast and know the plays.
You gotta look around, see everything.

374
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:05,894
When I step to the line, I see
everything happening before it happens.

375
00:23:06,062 --> 00:23:08,294
I'm a good one or two seconds
ahead of the coverage.

376
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:11,125
The boy scout's pretty arrogant.

377
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:15,710
- He's got a hell of an arm.
- Be a hero, win championships.

378
00:23:15,835 --> 00:23:18,109
I see it in you. All right?

379
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,214
Thank you, J.D.

380
00:23:23,382 --> 00:23:26,408
Now for our other <i>Dillon Gazette</i>
conference player of the week,

381
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,974
Vince Howard
of the East Dillon Lions.

382
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:37,334
Now some of you kids here,
this is your first year in pop warner,

383
00:23:37,502 --> 00:23:40,094
but guess what?
This is Vince's first year too.

384
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:43,214
Pay attention, all right?
You've got a role model here.

385
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:46,414
What do you say, Vince?
You got some words for these players?

386
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,533
What am I supposed to say?

387
00:23:55,742 --> 00:23:58,294
Just talk about the game.
Just tell 'em about it.

388
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,267
Don't panic, all right?

389
00:24:08,934 --> 00:24:09,934
Stay cool,

390
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:12,894
and you'll get paid.

391
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:29,738
Stop. Hold on.

392
00:24:29,863 --> 00:24:32,054
- Seriously, get away from me.
- One, two, say it.

393
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:33,317
No regrets.

394
00:24:40,622 --> 00:24:41,922
That feels good.

395
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,715
That was really close.

396
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,702
You guys remember
the state final game three years ago?

397
00:24:46,827 --> 00:24:47,827
No, Billy.

398
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:50,531
- What game?
- Stop messing with me, man.

399
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,174
Are you really reminiscing
about three years ago?

400
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:55,214
There was
ten seconds left on the clock.

401
00:24:55,518 --> 00:24:57,418
We had Matt "Mayday" Saracen

402
00:24:57,684 --> 00:24:59,774
sitting back there
behind the center.

403
00:24:59,942 --> 00:25:01,614
Never has he been called "Mayday".

404
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,303
We need to come up with a nickname.
I like "Cobra."

405
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:06,934
It's got a good sound to it.
Hey, cobra, think fast.

406
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,323
You're Cobra.

407
00:25:08,622 --> 00:25:09,475
Dude.

408
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,014
- Why would you kill Cobra's beer?
- I know. Let's see your hands.

409
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:16,614
You guys know I have to give a eulogy
at this thing tomorrow?

410
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,449
I got to get up there
in front of everybody

411
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:25,390
and say good stuff about this man.

412
00:25:27,112 --> 00:25:29,212
And all I really want to say is,

413
00:25:29,582 --> 00:25:31,332
"Here lies Henry Saracen.

414
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:34,254
"His mother annoyed him.

415
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,852
"His wife couldn't stand him.

416
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:40,914
"And he didn't want to be a dad,
so he took off to be in the army,

417
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,785
"that was the only way
you could come up with to get out 

418
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,610
"and ditch all responsibilities
and no one could call you out on it.

419
00:25:46,735 --> 00:25:49,854
"And that worked out great,
so you decided to enlist 4 more times,

420
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:52,254
"and that ended up getting you killed
and now here you are.

421
00:25:53,378 --> 00:25:56,874
"All you got left, all you left behind
is a mother with dementia,

422
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:59,075
"a divorced wife, and a son

423
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:02,487
"who delivers pizza.

424
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:06,746
"Thank you for coming,
100 people I do not know."

425
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:16,175
And the worst part is,
even if I did get up there and say that,

426
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,711
even if I finally did like,
say all that to him,

427
00:26:18,836 --> 00:26:20,589
I don't know
if I'd be saying it to him

428
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:22,774
because I don't know
if he's in that damn box.

429
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:25,614
It's a closed casket.
For all I know,

430
00:26:25,782 --> 00:26:27,182
it's someone else.

431
00:26:28,002 --> 00:26:29,552
It's someone funnier.

432
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,934
Or a bunch of rocks.

433
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,050
There's only one way
to find out then.

434
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:43,429
Right?

435
00:26:46,182 --> 00:26:47,909
Cobra, you got the key.

436
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:49,814
- There's no key.
- Break the window.

437
00:26:49,939 --> 00:26:52,214
- There's probably a door. It's stuck.
- Just break it.

438
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,129
All right, go in.

439
00:26:55,308 --> 00:26:58,510
- You sure we're supposed to be doing...
- You're wasted.

440
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:02,002
- Where is he?
- That's where I saw him before.

441
00:27:02,982 --> 00:27:03,882
Hold on.

442
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,614
All right, it's this guy.

443
00:27:08,236 --> 00:27:09,236
Hey, Matt.

444
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:13,219
- My friend...
- Hold on.

445
00:27:13,344 --> 00:27:15,534
My friend wants to see his old man.

446
00:27:16,281 --> 00:27:17,814
I want to see my dad.

447
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:20,971
I thought we agreed earlier

448
00:27:21,202 --> 00:27:24,054
- that that wasn't a good idea.
- Look, he wants to see his dad.

449
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:26,322
Hey all of you, just stop, stop.

450
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:28,025
Landry...

451
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:30,934
Look, I know what we decided earlier,
but now

452
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,250
I want to see my dad.

453
00:27:34,544 --> 00:27:35,544
Now.

454
00:27:57,581 --> 00:27:58,774
- That's him?
- Yeah.

455
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:04,681
- Son, this isn't a very good idea.
- I appreciate that but,

456
00:28:05,788 --> 00:28:07,288
please just open it.

457
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:32,981
Thank you.

458
00:28:40,322 --> 00:28:41,822
Matt, you all right?

459
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,340
Pictures, baby!

460
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:00,739
I thought we were going
to the field, man, come on.

461
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,174
We are going.
We're just getting a little practice.

462
00:29:04,302 --> 00:29:06,598
Cut that out, dude.
You're getting paint on my truck, man.

463
00:29:06,723 --> 00:29:08,854
This truck is a piece of crap anyways.
Don't worry.

464
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,054
It's a piece of crap I had to pay for
with my own money, dumbass.

465
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:14,254
- Get this pedestrian right here.
- I got him.

466
00:29:14,422 --> 00:29:15,574
Don't shoot him!

467
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,734
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

468
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:26,495
- Why are you stopping the car?
- Get out.

469
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,894
- Get out the truck!
- Hey, yo, relax.

470
00:29:29,062 --> 00:29:31,332
You got some kind of chip
on your shoulder, man.

471
00:29:31,457 --> 00:29:33,404
Look, that school you go to
is a dump, okay?

472
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:34,690
We all know this.

473
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,468
Do you want us to lie to you?

474
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:39,854
So every time we get to hang out,
I'll be the one you all look down on?

475
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:41,822
We don't look down on you!

476
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:44,134
We look down on you with you.

477
00:29:44,302 --> 00:29:46,192
That's right.
That was good, man.

478
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:49,158
- All right, jokers, that's funny.
- Come on, Luke.

479
00:29:49,283 --> 00:29:51,610
- Get out.
- Why you gotta do this?

480
00:29:51,862 --> 00:29:54,294
- What's your problem?
- What's my problem?! You're my problem.

481
00:29:57,114 --> 00:30:00,514
- What are you doing, dude?
- I'm not going paintballing.

482
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,174
You know what?
Screw you, Luke!

483
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,814
How does it feel being second best
on the worst team in Texas?

484
00:30:04,982 --> 00:30:07,082
- All right.
- Better watch it.

485
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,014
Come on, man.
Luke, I'm sorry.

486
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,414
Yeah, I'm sorry too.
You're done, dude.

487
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:19,565
- Come on. What are you doing?
- Get off my truck.

488
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:21,181
You're kidding!

489
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:22,494
Screw you, Luke!

490
00:31:00,553 --> 00:31:01,753
How did it go?

491
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:04,908
Second runner-up.

492
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:09,943
That's, uh...

493
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:11,723
That's third, right?

494
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:17,521
- Then, I guess it's not really...
- Third place sucks.

495
00:31:25,428 --> 00:31:26,978
So, how was your day?

496
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:30,698
Weird.

497
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,857
Weird, how?

498
00:31:37,617 --> 00:31:39,467
I saw something that, uh...

499
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:46,675
Rather I saw someone
that see something that...

500
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,493
You ever just feel
completely useless?

501
00:31:57,017 --> 00:31:58,414
You're not useless.

502
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:00,784
Right.

503
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:04,134
Close your eyes.

504
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:08,232
Just do it.

505
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:29,112
This...

506
00:32:31,205 --> 00:32:32,294
This can't happen.

507
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:34,485
I can't do this.

508
00:32:53,684 --> 00:32:54,574
You got I.D.?

509
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:57,774
It's for my mama.
She ain't feeling too good.

510
00:32:58,213 --> 00:32:59,414
I need to see I.D.

511
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:00,934
You know, I walked...

512
00:33:01,102 --> 00:33:02,902
You're almost out of soap.

513
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:06,206
Becky, right?

514
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,134
There you go.

515
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:10,214
That doesn't look good.

516
00:33:13,177 --> 00:33:15,734
- What do you think?
- I think you ought to buy something.

517
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:18,737
We're together.
This is my stuff.

518
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:24,317
My I.D.

519
00:33:27,274 --> 00:33:28,674
- Thanks.
- Sure.

520
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:36,855
- Thanks again.
- Yeah, yeah.

521
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:38,534
My name's Luke.

522
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:40,214
I know who you are.

523
00:33:42,611 --> 00:33:43,614
See you later.

524
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,690
You want to go to a car wash?
I got to go to a car wash.

525
00:33:52,257 --> 00:33:53,707
Look at that thing.

526
00:33:57,917 --> 00:33:58,667
Sure.

527
00:33:59,085 --> 00:34:02,135
- Why the hell not?
- All right. Why the hell not?

528
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:08,537
You want to get that, sweetie?

529
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:18,602
Sorry, uh...

530
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,682
I know I'm really late.

531
00:34:22,984 --> 00:34:23,984
It's okay.

532
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,656
We saved you a plate.

533
00:34:27,925 --> 00:34:28,925
Thank you.

534
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:31,493
Mrs. Taylor, I'm sorry...

535
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:33,734
You're fine, honey.
We saved you a plate.

536
00:34:33,902 --> 00:34:35,454
We saved our dessert for now.

537
00:34:35,622 --> 00:34:37,374
We'll have dessert with you,
you're fine.

538
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:39,573
Sit down, don't you worry.

539
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:42,127
- You drive?
- No sir, no.

540
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,334
I had a nice walk, though.

541
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,170
You don't have to eat
if you don't want to.

542
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,750
I'm hungry.

543
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:04,196
Do you want something else, hon?

544
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:09,454
I'm sorry, I don't like carrots,

545
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:11,352
and I don't...

546
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:14,534
like when they touch the meat, so...

547
00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:16,606
- I'll take it away.
- Don't worry about it.

548
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:19,174
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.

549
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:21,150
I'm being rude, I'm sorry.

550
00:35:21,275 --> 00:35:24,734
- Honey, you're fine.
- I don't like being rude.

551
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:27,681
I think I'm just having
a moment here.

552
00:35:31,098 --> 00:35:34,014
I'm just having a moment,
I don't think I'm okay.

553
00:35:41,393 --> 00:35:42,567
I hate him.

554
00:35:44,865 --> 00:35:45,974
And I don't...

555
00:35:46,142 --> 00:35:47,992
I don't like hating people.

556
00:35:49,804 --> 00:35:53,889
I just put all my hate on him
so I don't have to hate anybody else.

557
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:57,317
So that I could be a good person...

558
00:35:59,612 --> 00:36:01,999
to my grandmother, to my friends.

559
00:36:04,678 --> 00:36:06,028
To your daughter.

560
00:36:07,108 --> 00:36:10,734
That's all I want to say. I just want
to tell to his face I hate him.

561
00:36:13,477 --> 00:36:14,934
But he doesn't even have a face.

562
00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:20,070
I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor.
I see y'all tomorrow.

563
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:22,939
- Matt, you don't have to go!
- Julie.

564
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:24,414
It's alright, honey.

565
00:36:26,587 --> 00:36:30,037
- Come here, sweetie.
- You're gonna let him go like that?

566
00:36:33,264 --> 00:36:34,590
It'll be alright.

567
00:36:34,715 --> 00:36:37,256
Your dad is gonna
talk to him, honey.

568
00:36:40,244 --> 00:36:42,101
Why didn't you do something?

569
00:36:42,226 --> 00:36:44,334
We can't just let him hurt like that.

570
00:37:14,255 --> 00:37:15,934
I'm gonna walk you home.

571
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:04,711
- Looks good.
- It's pretty.

572
00:38:54,314 --> 00:38:55,814
Look at his picture.

573
00:38:56,942 --> 00:39:00,054
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

574
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,134
For thine is the kingdom,
and the power,

575
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:06,174
and the glory,
for ever and ever. Amen

576
00:39:06,876 --> 00:39:08,654
Now, Matt would like to share

577
00:39:08,822 --> 00:39:11,272
some words
of his remembrance with us.

578
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,167
I'm just gonna tell you one...

579
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:26,334
one story I remember
and that will be it.

580
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:30,222
We were at...

581
00:39:32,146 --> 00:39:33,346
a supermarket.

582
00:39:34,468 --> 00:39:35,468
It was me,

583
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:37,688
my mom,

584
00:39:39,032 --> 00:39:40,032
Grandma,

585
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:44,998
and my dad.

586
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:47,646
All four of us, a whole family.

587
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:51,094
My dad was pushing the cart,
and he stopped to grab...

588
00:39:51,578 --> 00:39:54,667
some toilet paper, put it in the cart
and my grandma said:

589
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:58,642
" No, that's not the right one.
That's not the paper that we use."

590
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:03,414
And she grabbed the right toilet paper
and put it in the cart...

591
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,159
and stormed off.

592
00:40:07,262 --> 00:40:09,912
And my dad just kind of
stared off at her,

593
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:14,694
then, he grabbed all the toilet paper
off the shelf and put it in the cart.

594
00:40:16,262 --> 00:40:19,974
I mean, he just stacked it full of...
And it wasn't spiteful or nothing.

595
00:40:21,078 --> 00:40:23,628
I don't know,
maybe you had to be there,

596
00:40:23,905 --> 00:40:25,505
but as a six-year-old,

597
00:40:26,322 --> 00:40:29,654
it was the funniest day I've seen.
I just laughed about it for weeks.

598
00:40:32,302 --> 00:40:33,302
I guess...

599
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,819
my dad was just a funnier person
than he really let on.

600
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:41,854
He was kind of private in that way,

601
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:43,981
and I don't even know why.

602
00:40:48,315 --> 00:40:50,614
But one thing he wasn't private about
was his service.

603
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,420
He was in the army for...

604
00:40:54,382 --> 00:40:56,941
20 years and that was something
he was...

605
00:40:57,066 --> 00:40:58,366
He was proud of.

606
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:00,629
He missed...

607
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:04,094
He missed all my birthdays.

608
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,204
He missed a lot of me growing up.

609
00:41:10,744 --> 00:41:13,382
But I think the point is
that I got to grow up.

610
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,934
That I got to have those birthdays.

611
00:41:19,553 --> 00:41:21,014
He went and did a job...

612
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:25,102
that not many people want to do.

613
00:41:28,138 --> 00:41:29,799
Because of that,
we all get to be here,

614
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:33,024
we get to grow up
and we get to have our birthdays.

615
00:41:38,675 --> 00:41:40,780
I think that's something
to be proud of.

616
00:41:43,613 --> 00:41:44,913
So, thank you...

617
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:49,131
for being here
and my family thanks you.

618
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,734
On behalf of the president of the USA
and our grateful nation,

619
00:42:02,902 --> 00:42:04,894
for the service
rendered by your loved one.

620
00:42:05,912 --> 00:42:06,912
Thank you.

621
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:09,904
Thank you.

622
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:23,748
You're all invited now

623
00:42:24,262 --> 00:42:26,414
to the Saracen house
for a reception.

624
00:42:26,582 --> 00:42:28,532
So, we hope to see you there.
