1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:01,651
We're moving again,
aren't we?

2
00:00:01,692 --> 00:00:05,373
Your father was offered
an amazing job at TMU

3
00:00:05,517 --> 00:00:06,204
in Austin.

4
00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:07,260
Well, that's good,
that's good,

5
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:08,706
because, guess what,
I'm not going.

6
00:00:08,747 --> 00:00:10,090
I got a girlfriend
who cheated on me.

7
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:11,460
I got parents
who are breaking up

8
00:00:11,563 --> 00:00:13,008
'cause of
some stupid lawsuit.

9
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:13,849
I lost a coach.

10
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:14,880
Lost in quad rugby.

11
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:15,808
So I got nothing.

12
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:17,296
A bipolar disorder?

13
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:19,036
It can be
dangerous sometimes.

14
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,561
People get really depressed.

15
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:21,841
Even suicidal.

16
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:22,433
Hut.

17
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:23,813
Backside pressure.

18
00:00:24,076 --> 00:00:24,801
There ya go.

19
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:26,381
You ever think about coaching?

20
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:29,051
No!

21
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:30,870
Get in the truck.

22
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:32,481
Ah, you bitch!

23
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,572
He tried to rape me.

24
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:41,702
By who, huh?

25
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:52,481
Honey?

26
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:55,553
Honey.

27
00:00:56,815 --> 00:00:57,413
Honey?

28
00:00:57,918 --> 00:00:58,553
- Wake up.
- What?

29
00:00:58,907 --> 00:00:59,963
What?
What time is it?

30
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:01,293
No, you're all right.
You're all right.

31
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:02,340
You haven't missed
your flight yet.

32
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:03,242
It's not 4:00 yet.

33
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,403
So I coulda
been asleep.

34
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,162
Sweetheart?

35
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:07,501
I just woke up
with the worst feeling.

36
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:09,022
That we shouldn't
move to Austin.

37
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:11,843
It's just-- It's cold feet.
You just don't--

38
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:14,773
- It's cold feet. Shh.
- Well, maybe it is, but sweetheart...

39
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,313
When you go
into TMU today,

40
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:22,270
please just don't
commit to them. I just--

41
00:01:23,036 --> 00:01:23,452
Okay.

42
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:26,410
- Did you hear me?
- Uh-huh.

43
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:30,221
- You sure?
- Yes, I hear you.

44
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:37,733
Guess it is
time to get up.

45
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:39,162
I'm gonna kill you.

46
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:40,373
Sweetheart.

47
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:48,503
Mom!

48
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:52,662
Mom, I'm hungry!

49
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:56,352
Hold on.

50
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:01,951
I want French toast!

51
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:03,050
Mom!

52
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:10,483
Mom, come on!

53
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:11,993
Okay, okay, I'm coming.

54
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:19,063
Yeah! I know who!

55
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:23,101
- Bo?
- Goodie!

56
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:27,032
Tim!

57
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:28,083
You're up early.

58
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:29,931
That's because
we're gonna start training.

59
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:30,731
- Oh Boy!
- All right?

60
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:31,622
You ready for this?

61
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,640
- Oh, yeah.
- Are you sure?

62
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:33,420
Oh, yeah!

63
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:34,860
Pow. Pow. Pow.

64
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:36,190
You ready?
Let's go just left.

65
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:37,671
A nice, tight left.

66
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:39,221
Maybe to the throat.

67
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:41,621
- Uh-uh-uh!
- Nice.

68
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:02,203
First of all, Eric, we're very
excited to have you here.

69
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:04,502
Glad to be here,
I'll tell ya.

70
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:07,012
A guy with the reputation
that you've got,

71
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:09,042
with the accomplishments
that you've had

72
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,072
at the high school level.

73
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,003
The way you've developed
those young kids.

74
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:13,803
We think

75
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:16,413
that you would be
an unbelievable

76
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:18,603
addition to our staff here.

77
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:20,563
Well, I appreciate that.

78
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:23,733
I know a couple weeks ago
we talked,

79
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:25,123
and, and, uh...

80
00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:27,801
the offer's been out on the table
for a week, Eric.

81
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:30,313
I know.
I understand that.

82
00:03:30,396 --> 00:03:31,553
Are you having
second thoughts?

83
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:33,781
No, I'm not having
second thoughts.

84
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:35,380
It's just
a matter of, uh--

85
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:37,083
well, you guys understand.
You don't want

86
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:38,002
the news to get out

87
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:39,403
if you've got a championship
game coming up.

88
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,013
Well, I'm gonna be
really honest with you, Eric.

89
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:42,731
I've got another guy.

90
00:03:43,317 --> 00:03:46,070
He's been offered three jobs
at three different universities.

91
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,212
We've come to
the point where

92
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,093
we can't risk losing

93
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:51,310
our second choice

94
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,851
while you're making
this decision.

95
00:03:53,217 --> 00:03:54,451
We've got
to know something,

96
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:55,911
and we've got
to know it now.

97
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:58,140
Or we've gotta
withdraw our offer.

98
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:12,252
Gentlemen, I accept.

99
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:24,000

103
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:05,022
I'm coming!

104
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:09,001
Landry?

105
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,622
You're not in school?

106
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:13,752
No, I ditched calculus.

107
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:15,141
It's no big deal.

108
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:16,281
You ditched a class?

109
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:18,242
Have you ever in your life
ditched a day of class?

110
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:19,861
Psh, yeah.

111
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:21,593
Like a few times.
No.

112
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:22,970
I didn't think so.

113
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,763
But, um, I noticed that
you weren't in school today

114
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:26,182
or yesterday, so I just

115
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:27,980
- wanted to see how you were.
- Landry, don't.

116
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,390
It's no big deal.
Wanted to see if maybe

117
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:31,552
you talk to anyone about this.
Like, maybe your mom.

118
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:33,052
No. No.
My mom happens to be

119
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,653
in the boonies with my aunt,
who's dying of ovarian cancer. So...

120
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:37,992
You know, there's
bigger things going on.

121
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:39,303
I'm sorry.

122
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:40,602
Yeah, well.

123
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:43,770
I mean, there's gotta be someone
that you can tell about this.

124
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:44,263
No.

125
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:46,342
- I mean, like, some kind of relative.
- Landry, there's no one!

126
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:49,023
Okay?

127
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:49,933
It's nobody's
damn business.

128
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:51,041
So don't go
telling anybody.

129
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:52,833
You understand?

130
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:56,173
Yeah.

131
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:57,581
Just forget about it.

132
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:12,661
Man, I just don't see
why we gotta go

133
00:06:12,678 --> 00:06:14,441
to this stupid roast
anyways, you know?

134
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,831
I feel you on that, man.

135
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:18,211
Ma we are actor leads
we are not comedians,

136
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:18,963
you know what I'm saying?

137
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:20,070
That's why
it's funny.

138
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:21,120
'Cause y'all suck.

139
00:06:21,486 --> 00:06:22,800
Look, how 'bout this one?

140
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:24,821
When Matty
first became QB,

141
00:06:25,188 --> 00:06:26,171
he was so shy,

142
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:28,153
he had to email
all his plays.

143
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:30,200
Like I said,
y'all suck.

144
00:06:30,382 --> 00:06:31,458
Hey, say that again.

145
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:33,206
No, say that again.
Say that to my face.

146
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:35,416
Baby, baby,
can I talk to you for a second?

147
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:37,191
Can I talk to you
for a second?

148
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:38,810
Listen, um,

149
00:06:39,426 --> 00:06:40,542
about the banquet.

150
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:41,551
Roast.

151
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,042
Whatever. Um...

152
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:44,981
I don't think
I can go.

153
00:06:46,058 --> 00:06:47,370
What you talking about?
You my date.

154
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:49,152
Look, The Smash
don't fly solo.

155
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:50,542
Okay, I know
that The Smash

156
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:51,881
has his ways
and everything,

157
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:52,720
But I just...

158
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:53,762
I feel like

159
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:56,052
with everything I'm going through
right now, it's just--

160
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,463
It's too much.

161
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,292
Baby, it's sittin'
and eatin'.

162
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:00,530
How is that too much?

163
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:01,720
Just trust, okay?

164
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,302
It's gonna stress me out,
and I need to

165
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:05,020
stay calm and focused.

166
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:06,562
I need structure
right now.

167
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:09,423
Okay.

168
00:07:14,157 --> 00:07:15,252
Thanks for understanding.

169
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:17,713
Come on, we'll work
on your jokes.

170
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,670
All right,
thank you very much.

171
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:33,352
Hey.

172
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:35,071
Hey.

173
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:36,783
What are you doing here?

174
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:38,980
- No, what are you doing here?
- I asked you first.

175
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:41,191
Well, I live here
in Dillon.

176
00:07:41,405 --> 00:07:43,202
So I'm here to get
some paperwork filled out.

177
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:44,972
'Cause you are now looking at
a gainfully-employed

178
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:46,640
assistant football coach

179
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:47,460
for the Dillon Panthers.

180
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:48,650
- No way.
- Yes.

181
00:07:48,817 --> 00:07:50,123
Aw, cool.

182
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:51,572
Now you.

183
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:52,450
What are you
doing here?

184
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:53,982
Oh, a ticket.

185
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:54,620
You know,

186
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:58,050
get a traffic ticket in Dillon,
you gotta pay it in Dillon. So...

187
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:00,762
Well, uh...

188
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:02,222
How long are you here for?

189
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:04,560
A couple weeks.
I'm helping my sister...

190
00:08:04,955 --> 00:08:06,971
- paint and get her place--
- That's nice of you.

191
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:08,750
- Yeah.
- A couple weeks?

192
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:10,321
- A couple weeks.
- Well, if you've got any, uh--

193
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:11,801
if you've got any downtime
while you're here then...

194
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,110
Oh, anything

195
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:14,513
to get me
outta that house.

196
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:16,242
Well then, we should
se a movie or--

197
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:17,620
or dinner or something,
catch up.

198
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:19,410
Sounds like a date.

199
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:21,260
Not a date.

200
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:22,271
A plan?

201
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:22,953
A plan.

202
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:24,562
- Yes. An arrangement.
- An arrangement.

203
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:25,751
So Thursday?

204
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:27,553
Thursday would be great.

205
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:29,160
All right.
Great.

206
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,042
- All right, cool.
- So Thursday it is then

207
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:32,393
for the, uh--
for the arrangement.

208
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:33,150
Take care.

209
00:08:33,187 --> 00:08:34,173
Yeah, you too.

210
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:35,851
- And I'll see you then.
- Bye.

211
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:37,601
Thursday.

212
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:44,373
Hey.

213
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:45,872
What's going on, man?

214
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:47,023
I gotta--

215
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:48,481
First you miss Mud Bowl,

216
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:50,273
and then I can barely even
get you on the phone.

217
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:51,971
How'd it go?
I mean, what happened?

218
00:08:52,235 --> 00:08:53,061
How'd what go?

219
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:55,263
The big study date
with Tyra Collette.

220
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:57,191
Oh, it went fine.

221
00:08:57,586 --> 00:08:58,542
Fine?
Well--

222
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:00,712
Did you confess
your love to her?

223
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:05,321
This is all just some kind
of big joke, isn't it, Matt?

224
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,400
"Landry's got
a big crush on Tyra."

225
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:09,051
I'm just here
for the comic relief

226
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:09,980
for the star quarterback,

227
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:10,822
- is that it?
- No, that's not it.

228
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:11,950
I'm just curious how it--

229
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:13,141
what happened?

230
00:09:13,408 --> 00:09:14,241
What's wrong?

231
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:16,962
You promise
not to tell anyone

232
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:17,970
if I tell you this?

233
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:19,823
You're not gonna say
a word about it to anyone one?

234
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:20,503
Yeah.

235
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,560
You're not
gonna tell Julie?

236
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:22,881
You're not gonna
tell anyone about this?

237
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,281
No, I'm not gonna
tell Julie anything. What?

238
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,932
There--there was
an assault.

239
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,432
What do you mean,
"There was an assault?"

240
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,292
I was late.

241
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:33,350
And then
there was this guy.

242
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:35,382
Some stranger
that attacked Tyra

243
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,000
outside the Alamo Freeze, and then

244
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:38,470
- tried to do--
- Is she okay?

245
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:41,393
Well, yeah.
I mean, she--she--

246
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:42,633
She fought him off.

247
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:44,271
What did the cops say?

248
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,222
Well, she didn't want
to tell the cops, so we--

249
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:49,542
So who'd you tell?

250
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:51,541
She didn't want
anyone to know. I mean,

251
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:53,993
she just wanted to, you know,
not make a big deal

252
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:54,890
about it, and just--

253
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:55,680
Matt, look--

254
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:58,070
She just wants to kinda--
I have no idea--

255
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,041
I mean, she swore me
to secrecy, man.

256
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:01,550
So what am I--
What am I supposed to do?

257
00:10:01,806 --> 00:10:04,382
Matt, tell me what I'm supposed
to do in this situation.

258
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:07,943
You gotta tell somebody.

259
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:10,101
Landry, you know.

260
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:12,441
You have to tell somebody.

261
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:20,010
Hey, babe,

262
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,853
how'd it go? Hold on,
I'm just on the phone.

263
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:24,092
I'm just trying to reach Tyra.
She's been MIA.

264
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,193
Can't wait to hear
how it went.

265
00:10:29,257 --> 00:10:30,551
Sweetie, I hate
to send a message--

266
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:42,723
- It went pretty good.
- Have you been drinking?

267
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:47,463
You didn't tell 'em
"yes" yet, did you?

268
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:51,332
Here's how
it went down.

269
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:52,760
First of all,

270
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:54,501
I was hot-boxed
from the get-go.

271
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:56,282
It was--
it was either

272
00:10:56,318 --> 00:10:57,962
accept the job
or lose the job.

273
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,861
I didn't want 'em to think
that I didn't want the job,

274
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:01,093
obviously, you know.

275
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:02,622
You didn't
tell 'em--

276
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:04,182
So I said, "You know,
I gotta think about this.

277
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:05,162
Yes, I accept the job."

278
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:06,733
So, um...

279
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:08,373
This stadium...

280
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,763
It's just like--
it's unbelievable.

281
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:12,710
And then, uh,

282
00:11:12,857 --> 00:11:14,700
I went around Austin.
They put me in a car.

283
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:16,602
They had me drive around.
It was--

284
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:19,790
it was pretty--
It was pretty incredible.

285
00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:21,102
And then, uh...

286
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:23,892
- Yep.
- Hey.

287
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:41,550
I took the job
in Austin.

288
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:53,620
Want to
talk about it?

289
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,330
Oh.

290
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:24,011
It's Julie, honey.

291
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:25,440
All right. I'll get it.

292
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:26,190
Okay.

293
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:29,812
Hey, you want to
come inside?

294
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:33,080
You okay?

295
00:12:34,097 --> 00:12:34,891
What's going on?

296
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:39,390
What?
Tell me.

297
00:12:43,686 --> 00:12:44,431
I'm moving.

298
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:47,840
What--What do you--
What do you mean?

299
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:51,440
My dad took this--

300
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:53,553
this job at TMU.

301
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:16,903
Yeah.

302
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:18,880
- Good morning, Coach.
- Come on in here, man,

303
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:20,001
you're 15 minutes late.

304
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,642
I was?
You told me to be here at--

305
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:23,202
No, I said
15 minutes ago.

306
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:24,113
Don't talk back to me.

307
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:25,441
- No, sir.
- Hey, Saracen.

308
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:27,161
Get your lazy ass in here.
Let's go, come on.

309
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:28,831
Hurry up.
I don't have much time.

310
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:32,103
- Hiya, Street.
- Saracen.

311
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:33,391
- What's going on?
- Sunday.

312
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:35,491
Big championship game.

313
00:13:35,627 --> 00:13:36,311
How you feelin'?

314
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:37,420
Good.
I'm feeling good.

315
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:38,353
Yeah, you think
you're ready?

316
00:13:38,406 --> 00:13:38,740
Yeah.

317
00:13:38,935 --> 00:13:39,872
You think he's ready?

318
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:40,800
I don't think
he's ready.

319
00:13:40,857 --> 00:13:42,231
I'm not thinking
you're ready either.

320
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:43,373
I think that if he plays
up in Dallas

321
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:45,382
liked he played last Friday night,
they're gonna eat him for breakfast.

322
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,782
That's pretty much
what I'm thinking.

323
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:47,732
I think they're
gonna squash him.

324
00:13:47,798 --> 00:13:48,841
Pretty much like a bug.

325
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:49,813
Like a flea, Saracen.

326
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:51,493
So I don't want you
resting on your laurels,

327
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:52,311
you understand me?

328
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:54,283
- You don't have any laurels, Saracen.
- Not a damn laurel.

329
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:56,012
Here's what's
gonna happen.

330
00:13:57,347 --> 00:13:58,711
You're gonna be
working with Jason here.

331
00:13:58,857 --> 00:13:59,251
Okay.

332
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:01,511
You're gonna do everything
Jason tells you to.

333
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:03,980
And you're gonna do it
because Jason has my blessing.

334
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:06,211
So if he tells you
to jump off a cliff,

335
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:08,903
I want you
to jump off that cliff.

336
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:10,012
Now you tell me,

337
00:14:10,878 --> 00:14:12,662
Saracen, why are you
gonna jump off that cliff?

338
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:15,461
'Cause--'cause he has
your blessing?

339
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:16,580
That's exactly right.

340
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:18,413
You have any problems,

341
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:19,420
you let me know.

342
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:21,020
- Thank you, Coach.
- Have a good day, son.

343
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:22,013
All right, Coach.

344
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:23,832
What are you still
standing here for, Saracen?

345
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:25,962
Go finish your weights,
finish your program.

346
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:27,830
Get your plays, meet me
in the film room for lunch.

347
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:28,830
And get used to that

348
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:30,741
because we're gonna be having
an awful lot of meals together.

349
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:32,361
Well actually, I usually
have lunch with Julie.

350
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:33,890
I'll take care of Julie for you,
don't worry about it.

351
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:35,090
I'll give her
a nice call,

352
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:37,022
tell her there's a new girl in town.
And that girl is me.

353
00:14:38,347 --> 00:14:40,023
Thank you, Saracen.
Hit the weights.

354
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:41,570
Okay.

355
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:43,232
Great.

356
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:48,540
It's just that this friend

357
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:51,153
made me promise
not to tell anyone. So I--

358
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:53,361
Well, that's--that's--

359
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:54,671
that's common, I think.

360
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:56,701
Sometimes when people
experice trauma,

361
00:14:57,306 --> 00:14:59,451
um, they'll sometimes
want to hide.

362
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:02,030
You know, for fear
of, um, reprisal.

363
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,701
Or--or, um--

364
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:04,812
Or judgment.

365
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,102
Sometimes that happens.

366
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:10,050
Is there some kind of law

367
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:12,300
that if I do tell you the student's
name that was assaulted

368
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:13,491
that you've got to report it?

369
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:19,822
Isn't--isn't--
isn't that some kind of law?

370
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:22,021
Um...

371
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:24,513
I don't want you
to be offended by this,

372
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,343
but, if-- if it turns out that
your friend is actually you,

373
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:30,820
I want you
to feel comfortable.

374
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,020
- And you've been hurt--
- No.

375
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,633
I want you to know
you can absolutely

376
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:35,703
- talk to me...
- I'm not talking about me.

377
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:37,333
...completely safely
about that.

378
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,153
I'm not talking
about me, okay?

379
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:46,582
You can tell me.

380
00:15:49,186 --> 00:15:50,880
I'm talking about Tyra.

381
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:52,370
Collette.

382
00:15:58,906 --> 00:15:59,502
Oh.

383
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:11,052
Hey, Tyra.

384
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:22,433
Look, it's not
that big of a deal.

385
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:25,402
Yeah, it is,
sweetheart.

386
00:16:28,046 --> 00:16:29,250
Let me ask you
one more time:

387
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:31,282
do you remember leaving
your notebook behind?

388
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:32,101
No.

389
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:36,931
But, when he came outside
he had a notebook

390
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,642
that looked
like your notebook?

391
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,672
Look, I already told you,
I don't remember leaving my notebook.

392
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,400
Are we done here?
Can I go now?

393
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,970
I believe
that about covers it.

394
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,801
We just have to get
a few pictures.

395
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:57,841
All right, let's--

396
00:16:58,127 --> 00:16:59,410
Let's go
do that quickly.

397
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:05,021
Turn your head
to the left.

398
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:35,593
Tyra, I'm sorry--

399
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:37,692
No, you know what,
I never should have trusted you.

400
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:40,621
- Tyra, I'm--
- You know what you are?

401
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:42,253
You are just

402
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,260
a pathetic, smelly geek.

403
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:47,310
And I never want you
to talk to me again.

404
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,163
So, uh...

405
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:01,283
yeah, I guess, just, uh...

406
00:18:01,435 --> 00:18:03,053
Just give me a call
when you get a chance.

407
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:04,572
All right.

408
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:12,883
You know, Tyra isn't even
returning my phone calls.

409
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,460
Guess I'm just not
cool enough anymore.

410
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:23,151
You never know what's going on
with somebody, sweetie.

411
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:25,871
Can't take it personally.

412
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:28,331
The whole move,
it's just like

413
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:29,563
a bad dream on repeat.

414
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:30,791
I know.

415
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:34,681
Hey, babe!

416
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:35,373
Hey.

417
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,383
Hey, come on,
let's go celebrate.

418
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:38,181
I'm taking you out
to dinner.

419
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:39,433
Taking you out
to dinner.

420
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:42,141
Anywhere you wanna go.
Julie, you get to choose.

421
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:43,732
Wherever it is
that you like to go.

422
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:49,162
I know what's gonna happen next.
The door's gonna slam.

423
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:52,600
Why is that?

424
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:53,560
What's going on?

425
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:54,180
Hi.

426
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:56,111
Come sit down.

427
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:07,492
Hi.

428
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:11,693
What?

429
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:13,133
I don't know,
that's why I'm--

430
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,303
I don't know.

431
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:17,122
Why don't you tell me?

432
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:18,122
What is it?

433
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,253
I've been thinking
about something today.

434
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:26,563
And I'm gonna
make a proposal to you,

435
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:28,503
and I don't want you
to jump any kind of

436
00:19:28,998 --> 00:19:30,582
immediate decision
about it, but...

437
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,342
Okay, all right.

438
00:19:31,478 --> 00:19:32,101
Okay.

439
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:37,481
I've been thinking
that, um...

440
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:41,711
Julie and I
could maybe stay here

441
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:44,291
until she graduates
from high school.

442
00:19:45,408 --> 00:19:47,651
That would give her
some closure here.

443
00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:49,892
It would allow me
to continue my work

444
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:51,243
here with the kids.

445
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,833
Dillon and Austin aren't that far
away from each other.

446
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:55,490
I mean, it's not
a long commute.

447
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:57,482
You could go on,
take the job in Austin.

448
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,450
It's not ideal,
but it's a way

449
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,393
that we could
continue our lives,

450
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,902
keep this family together.

451
00:20:07,448 --> 00:20:08,063
No.

452
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:11,600
Just no?

453
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:12,782
Yes, no.

454
00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:14,241
There's no way.

455
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:15,730
You can't say, "Just no."

456
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,010
No, and I'll tell you why
it's not gonna happen,

457
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:18,302
'cause that commute
between Dillon and Austin

458
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:19,413
is not just
a simple commute.

459
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:21,462
That's a separation
between this family, no way.

460
00:20:21,508 --> 00:20:22,812
You know what,
I need you to just

461
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:24,152
- think about it for a second.
- I'm thinking about it.

462
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:25,271
I'm listening.
I thought about it.

463
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:27,800
Well, I think we need to start
to consider this now

464
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:30,103
from the perspective
of three people in this family.

465
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:31,110
And you and I

466
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:32,613
have a solid relationship.

467
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:33,882
We have
a mature relationship.

468
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:34,790
We are mature people,

469
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:36,812
and I know that our relationship
can handle it.

470
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:38,432
Well, you know what?
No, in that sense,

471
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,811
I'm not mature,
I'm not mature.

472
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:41,092
I can't handle that,

473
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:42,272
because that's not
a relationship.

474
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:43,052
That's not a family.

475
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:44,263
That's not what
this family's gonna do.

476
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:45,422
And as far as
those three people,

477
00:20:45,437 --> 00:20:46,870
you're leaving one person out,
and that would be me.

478
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:47,961
'Cause I don't agree
with this at all.

479
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:50,761
I do not agree with any bit
of what you've said.

480
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:52,390
Well, honey, you know what
I'm thinking about right now?

481
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:54,181
I'm thinking about
how bad I'm gonna feel

482
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:55,362
leaving these kids here.

483
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:56,392
Why is this happening?

484
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:57,243
Honey?

485
00:20:58,026 --> 00:20:59,292
I need you
to hear me here.

486
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:00,382
I hear you.
I hear what you say.

487
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:01,110
What I'm doing here
is important.

488
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:02,663
I did this thing
with Tyra today.

489
00:21:02,947 --> 00:21:04,160
These kids need me.

490
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,810
And that's something
that I need.

491
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:07,843
There are other jobs, and there
are other kids that need your help.

492
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:09,052
No, there are not
other jobs.

493
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:10,113
There is this job.

494
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:11,990
I took the job, and we
are moving to Austin, period.

495
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:14,642
These kids need me here.
I would feel bad to leave.

496
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:19,832
Can't you understand that?

497
00:21:30,168 --> 00:21:31,951
You're gonna be
so great in Dallas.

498
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,101
Look, I'm gonna
do what I do.

499
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:34,530
That's all I can do.

500
00:21:34,638 --> 00:21:36,403
Well, you know me,
my aunt, and my cousins

501
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:37,750
are driving up
to root you on.

502
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:38,622
Oh, for real?

503
00:21:38,717 --> 00:21:39,783
Yeah.

504
00:21:39,868 --> 00:21:41,812
Oh, well, I'll have to
keep that in mind then.

505
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:43,043
Yeah, you might
wanna do that.

506
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,193
- Hey.
- Hey, Wave.

507
00:21:45,258 --> 00:21:45,762
Um...

508
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:47,420
Can I holla at you
for a second?

509
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:49,283
Oh, yeah, I'll catch up
with y'all later.

510
00:21:50,188 --> 00:21:51,322
We's just talking,
that's all.

511
00:21:52,907 --> 00:21:54,361
Listen, um,

512
00:21:54,536 --> 00:21:56,542
I've been thinking
about this a lot, and, um,

513
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,603
I'm gonna give you
a hiatus.

514
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:01,313
A what?

515
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:03,852
A hiatus for two weeks

516
00:22:03,997 --> 00:22:05,323
while you're at State.

517
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:06,503
I want you to just

518
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,232
have the time
of your life, you know?

519
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:09,592
I don't need
no hiatus.

520
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:11,403
Look, I just--
I don't wanna be the one

521
00:22:11,425 --> 00:22:13,593
held responsible
for taking away your joy.

522
00:22:13,638 --> 00:22:16,020
So look, you're saying
for two weeks,

523
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:17,833
I could do
whatever I want.

524
00:22:17,996 --> 00:22:20,780
Well, I wouldn't
go crazy or anything.

525
00:22:20,818 --> 00:22:22,911
Like, try not to break
the law, you know.

526
00:22:22,978 --> 00:22:24,951
But, um...
But, yeah.

527
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:26,672
Enjoy yourself.

528
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:29,191
I don't--

529
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:30,590
but, you--

530
00:22:30,985 --> 00:22:32,241
we gonna be partyin'.

531
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:34,593
- I know.
- Okay, we gonna be going to State.

532
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:36,783
And you just gonna be
sitting at home,

533
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:38,491
taking your meds,
and going to bed early.

534
00:22:39,296 --> 00:22:40,722
I mean, what if I'm
hanging out with another girl

535
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,322
at the roast
or one of the parties?

536
00:22:43,855 --> 00:22:45,493
I don't know.
It's all right.

537
00:22:48,427 --> 00:22:49,193
That's all right?

538
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,080
That's all right.

539
00:22:52,007 --> 00:22:53,202
You know, just...

540
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,733
enjoy yourself.

541
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:56,331
Be The Smash.

542
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:58,020
Okay.

543
00:22:58,098 --> 00:22:58,880
Okay.

544
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:00,092
Okay, I could do that.

545
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:01,223
I know you
could do that.

546
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:02,460
I could do that
already.

547
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,220
Good mornin'.

548
00:23:06,537 --> 00:23:07,151
Hey.

549
00:23:08,506 --> 00:23:09,133
All right,

550
00:23:09,427 --> 00:23:10,603
this is what
I'm thinkin'.

551
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,901
- Listen, I've been thinking too.
- Listen for one second.

552
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:14,650
- No. I'm--
- Dinner, tonight,

553
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,531
- No, not dinner tonight.
- tacos. That's fine. That's fine.

554
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:18,532
No, not dinner
at all.

555
00:23:19,988 --> 00:23:20,791
What do you mean?

556
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:22,542
It's...

557
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:24,163
over.

558
00:23:24,258 --> 00:23:26,011
We're not doing this anymore.
You all right?

559
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:26,953
Why?

560
00:23:30,548 --> 00:23:33,323
Because maybe Bo
will get hurt.

561
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:37,802
He just--

562
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:40,043
he thinks you're, like,
a father figure, you know.

563
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,782
He's had a really tough time
with his daddy, and I don't--

564
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,560
I didn't think I was hurting him.

565
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,691
Well, you're not now,
but, I mean, you know--

566
00:23:54,857 --> 00:23:56,271
I just, I can't
do it to him.

567
00:23:59,088 --> 00:23:59,963
I can't risk it.

568
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,541
I love him.

569
00:24:01,865 --> 00:24:02,823
He's my--

570
00:24:04,635 --> 00:24:05,532
I'm sorry.

571
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:21,330
We need to talk
to you guys.

572
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:22,681
All right?

573
00:24:24,165 --> 00:24:25,340
Your father and I

574
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:27,061
are getting a divorce.

575
00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:30,793
We love you.

576
00:24:31,316 --> 00:24:32,451
We love you all.

577
00:24:32,845 --> 00:24:35,010
We do not want you
to be hurt over this.

578
00:24:35,095 --> 00:24:36,723
- We love you.
- This doesn't have anything to do

579
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,493
with y'all.

580
00:24:37,537 --> 00:24:38,901
And it's gonna be
just the same.

581
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:41,013
Except Daddy's not
gonna be living here.

582
00:24:41,145 --> 00:24:42,190
Y'all are gonna
live here.

583
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:44,401
I'll see y'all
on weekends.

584
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:46,250
You're gonna see them
every other weekend.

585
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:48,772
Every other weekend.

586
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:51,473
And then, uh, holidays.

587
00:24:51,998 --> 00:24:52,730
I can't.

588
00:24:52,935 --> 00:24:54,733
- Lyla--
- I need to get some air.

589
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,290
Lyla, honey,
I need you to come back.

590
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,163
Nope, I'm done.

591
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:58,843
We need to talk about this
as a family, sweetie.

592
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:00,693
He can leave, and then I'll come back.
How 'bout that?

593
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:10,020
So sorry I'm late.

594
00:25:10,105 --> 00:25:11,780
No, don't worry about it.

595
00:25:12,126 --> 00:25:12,961
It's Herc's fault.

596
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:14,292
Right.
Sure.

597
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:17,390
How ya doin'?

598
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:18,430
I'm good.

599
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:20,571
How you doin'?

600
00:25:21,326 --> 00:25:21,793
Good.

601
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,322
You look nice.

602
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:30,650
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

603
00:25:31,886 --> 00:25:32,413
Very nice.

604
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:33,613
Thanks.

605
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:36,061
You wanna go eat?

606
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:36,902
Yeah.

607
00:25:44,117 --> 00:25:45,820
Oh, man,
that was really fun.

608
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:47,530
It was.

609
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:50,020
Besides the fact that
our waiter was an idiot.

610
00:25:50,637 --> 00:25:51,932
I know.

611
00:25:52,688 --> 00:25:53,680
I don't think
we helped.

612
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:56,360
I think we might have
confused him further.

613
00:25:58,966 --> 00:25:59,852
You're fun.

614
00:26:01,496 --> 00:26:02,182
A little bit.

615
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,521
A lot with you.

616
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:07,713
I, um...

617
00:26:12,008 --> 00:26:12,883
I like you.

618
00:26:15,175 --> 00:26:15,863
Um...

619
00:26:19,888 --> 00:26:21,361
I'm starting to feel
really embarrassed.

620
00:26:21,436 --> 00:26:22,521
No. I, uh...

621
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:25,163
I, uh...

622
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:27,521
I like you too.

623
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:31,550
Really?

624
00:26:31,628 --> 00:26:33,613
Uh, you know,
really, I do.  I, uh...

625
00:27:06,327 --> 00:27:07,923
Oh, my God.
Jason.

626
00:27:16,028 --> 00:27:16,980
Lyla, I...

627
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,960
Can we talk?
Can you go inside,

628
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:21,803
just for a minute?

629
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:23,222
Please?

630
00:27:24,317 --> 00:27:25,220
'Cause it's not

631
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:27,322
what you think.

632
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:29,721
No, you know what?
I'm done.

633
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:39,721
Screw you!

634
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:12,260
Hey, Tim Riggins.

635
00:28:12,987 --> 00:28:14,082
How you doing, little man?

636
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:15,702
Good, you wanna hang?

637
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:19,252
We could play football
and do anything.

638
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:20,170
Hey, uh,

639
00:28:21,017 --> 00:28:23,053
did your mom
talk to you at all lately?

640
00:28:23,345 --> 00:28:24,740
Yeah, she said that

641
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:27,132
you would be busy
with football and school,

642
00:28:27,368 --> 00:28:29,983
that you wouldn't have time
to hang around anymore.

643
00:28:31,247 --> 00:28:32,731
I think
she's kind of right, Bo.

644
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,293
But I figured since...

645
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:37,543
we're obviously buds,

646
00:28:37,605 --> 00:28:38,810
you could make time
for me.

647
00:28:38,898 --> 00:28:40,803
'Cause we're
like brothers.

648
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:41,742
I agree.

649
00:28:42,385 --> 00:28:45,003
But like your mom said,
I got a lot going on. Okay?

650
00:28:46,877 --> 00:28:47,393
Okay.

651
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:49,413
But I'll come by later?

652
00:28:52,977 --> 00:28:53,960
- Sure.
- Yeah.

653
00:28:56,988 --> 00:28:57,510
Hey.

654
00:28:58,257 --> 00:28:59,472
- Yeah?
- Who pushes you around?

655
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:00,471
Nobody!

656
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:01,483
There we go.

657
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:06,810
Nobody pushes
Bo Miller around.

658
00:29:21,736 --> 00:29:22,462
Let me guess,

659
00:29:23,446 --> 00:29:24,831
the old lady you were
getting with dumped you.

660
00:29:26,237 --> 00:29:27,601
- Is that what's going on?
- Interesting.

661
00:29:27,805 --> 00:29:28,631
How do you know?

662
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:30,420
Small town, Tim.

663
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,203
Right.

664
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:32,390
- Forgot.
- And no,

665
00:29:32,427 --> 00:29:33,891
the ex-girlfriend Tyra's
not available

666
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:34,751
to screw your pain away.

667
00:29:34,795 --> 00:29:35,672
That's not
why I'm here.

668
00:29:35,728 --> 00:29:36,742
- Really?
- Really.

669
00:29:40,436 --> 00:29:42,453
I'm here just to see
if you just wanna hang out.

670
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:45,270
As friends.

671
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:46,472
I kinda...

672
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:49,511
I could use one right now.

673
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:52,000
Do you even know what
a friend is, Tim?

674
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,061
You know, a friend is someone
who's there for you.

675
00:29:58,605 --> 00:30:01,112
Who helps you do what's
best for yourself.  Who...

676
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:05,432
asks you to go out
and do things.

677
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:11,013
That's a friend.

678
00:30:14,905 --> 00:30:16,580
Come to the Panther roast
with me.

679
00:30:16,678 --> 00:30:17,580
That's not what I meant, Tim.

680
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:19,070
I know it's not
what you meant.

681
00:30:20,516 --> 00:30:21,070
Look...

682
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:24,963
I'm tired of over-thinking
every single thing, you know?

683
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:26,723
Let's just hang out

684
00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:28,212
and laugh and have fun.

685
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:30,300
You and me.

686
00:30:32,078 --> 00:30:33,252
As friends.

687
00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:35,300
Please?

688
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,250
Matty used to be so shy,
he had to email all his plays.

689
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:12,223
Hey, everybody!

690
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:14,353
Hey,

691
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:16,660
we're going to State,
people!

692
00:31:17,897 --> 00:31:18,611
All right!

693
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:20,860
Everybody take your seats!

694
00:31:21,056 --> 00:31:21,891
Take your seats!

695
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:24,320
Time to start
the annual roast banquet.

696
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:25,893
Everybody hurry up
and sit down!

697
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,280
Let's get this roast going.

698
00:31:28,285 --> 00:31:30,490
I'd like to bring up
for our first speaker,

699
00:31:30,838 --> 00:31:34,611
first-time Coach for the Dillon Panthers,
took us all the way to State this year.

700
00:31:34,697 --> 00:31:36,400
Coach Eric Taylor, baby!

701
00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:48,102
Let's start tonight
with...

702
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:50,400
The Smash.

703
00:31:53,915 --> 00:31:56,440
Now, what is there
to say about Smash?

704
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,312
There's nothing
to say about him,

705
00:31:58,338 --> 00:32:01,273
I don't think, that he hasn't already
said about himself!

706
00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:04,841
I'll be owning it.
You got me on that, Coach.

707
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,132
You got me on that.
You got me.

708
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:08,093
Hey, you guys know how
to give little Matt Saracen

709
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:09,030
a hard time
while you're here.

710
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:10,043
He's done a great job,

711
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,040
but I'll tell you, when he
first started as quarterback,

712
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:13,380
he was so shy...

713
00:32:13,606 --> 00:32:15,450
he had to email
his plays in.

714
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,793
Come on, Matt!

715
00:32:24,657 --> 00:32:27,581
Now, for as long
as I've known Tim Riggins,

716
00:32:28,258 --> 00:32:31,153
there's only two phrases
that can put a smile on his face.

717
00:32:31,777 --> 00:32:32,850
Number one,

718
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:34,863
we goin' to State.

719
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:41,043
And number two,

720
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:42,631
the results are in;

721
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:43,922
you are not the father.

722
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:48,723
Hey, I'm just playing
with you, baby!

723
00:32:48,728 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm just playing with you,
baby!

724
00:32:51,377 --> 00:32:52,252
Hey, uh,

725
00:32:52,645 --> 00:32:55,372
how about Saracen sleeping with
the Coach's daughter?

726
00:33:03,378 --> 00:33:05,640
Nothing quite like athletes
doing comedy.

727
00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:07,123
I think it's tradition.

728
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,211
Yeah, but so was
tar and feathering.

729
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:11,322
You can't stay in Dillon.
That's absurd.

730
00:33:12,518 --> 00:33:13,982
Thank you for calling me
absurd.

731
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:16,731
But Buddy Garrity will
tell you that it is much...

732
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:18,190
I'm not calling you absurd,

733
00:33:18,258 --> 00:33:19,313
I'm calling
the whole thing absurd.

734
00:33:19,407 --> 00:33:21,323
Well, I don't happen to think
it's absurd, obviously.

735
00:33:21,406 --> 00:33:22,910
Tryin' to argue that--

736
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:24,420
Will you guys talk about this
at home, please?

737
00:33:24,495 --> 00:33:25,463
Tami Taylor!

738
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:39,561
This is a roast,
not a skewering.

739
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,133
Oh, I'm aware
of that, sweetie.

740
00:33:41,908 --> 00:33:43,480
Lucky for you!

741
00:33:44,415 --> 00:33:45,131
Um...

742
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:46,001
Hi, y'all.

743
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:49,010
I'm here to talk to you a little bit
about Coach Eric Taylor.

744
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:55,812
You all know him
as your leader,

745
00:33:55,877 --> 00:33:57,460
you know,
a kind of father figure,

746
00:33:57,588 --> 00:34:00,111
a hard-ass guy screaming
at you from the sidelines.

747
00:34:00,158 --> 00:34:02,260
But there's a whole other
kind of Eric Taylor

748
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:03,830
that I know that maybe
y'all don't.

749
00:34:03,846 --> 00:34:05,240
And I'd just like to share that
with you a little bit.

750
00:34:05,318 --> 00:34:08,331
So let me start with
what I've learned from him

751
00:34:08,386 --> 00:34:10,963
as a human being.

752
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:13,820
I mean, what he has
brought to me...

753
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:15,553
as a person.

754
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:17,772
The power I.

755
00:34:18,836 --> 00:34:19,971
The nickel defense.

756
00:34:20,937 --> 00:34:21,952
The three-four...

757
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:22,913
The four-three...

758
00:34:22,975 --> 00:34:24,052
And of course,

759
00:34:24,257 --> 00:34:25,381
the spread formation.

760
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,831
The ways I have grown...

761
00:34:28,897 --> 00:34:30,790
since I have been
with this man

762
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:32,200
could fill a stadium.

763
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,843
And then there's Eric Taylor,
the family man.

764
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:38,493
We have wonderful
Sunday mornings together...

765
00:34:38,847 --> 00:34:40,512
watching game film.

766
00:34:41,617 --> 00:34:43,133
Saturday afternoons
with our daughter...

767
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:44,610
watching game film.

768
00:34:44,685 --> 00:34:46,860
Oh, and then Taylor Tuesday

769
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:49,361
where we'll have
a pizza delivered

770
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:51,422
and play Scrabble.
And then...

771
00:34:51,905 --> 00:34:54,112
watch some game film.

772
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:57,910
And I wanna tell y'all,
I know he is a busy, busy man.

773
00:34:57,977 --> 00:34:59,070
Y'all keep him very busy.

774
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:02,002
But he is also a sensitive
and caring husband.

775
00:35:02,655 --> 00:35:04,373
And he'll take me out

776
00:35:04,455 --> 00:35:07,253
for quiet, romantic evenings.
Just the two of us.

777
00:35:07,717 --> 00:35:10,553
And will commonly be heard
shouting things like,

778
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:11,703
"Pick up the blitz!"

779
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:14,710
Or, "Hit and drive!"
And my favorite, "Go for two!"

780
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:23,501
Seriously,

781
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:25,092
Eric Taylor...

782
00:35:26,577 --> 00:35:28,130
is a kind and decent man.

783
00:35:30,635 --> 00:35:31,750
And he's strong.

784
00:35:32,195 --> 00:35:33,442
And he has vision.

785
00:35:34,428 --> 00:35:35,652
And he's passionate.

786
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,352
And he's real good
at imparting that passion

787
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:41,433
into the hearts
of the people around him.

788
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:44,481
And he loves y'all, kids.

789
00:35:47,817 --> 00:35:49,050
Every single one of y'all.

790
00:35:54,645 --> 00:35:57,171
I just want to tell you how much
you all have touched us.

791
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:00,482
How important
you all are to us.

792
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,193
How deeply
we care about you.

793
00:36:05,738 --> 00:36:06,970
So thank y'all

794
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,691
from our whole family.

795
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:09,391
Thank you.

796
00:36:33,588 --> 00:36:34,840
You got a good one, Coach.

797
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:37,242
A real good one.

798
00:36:49,785 --> 00:36:50,651
Hey, Smash.

799
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:52,751
So we're getting ready
to hit a party.

800
00:36:52,848 --> 00:36:53,501
You wanna come?

801
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:57,601
Actually, I'm gonna pass.

802
00:36:58,307 --> 00:36:59,720
Yeah, I gotta rest up
for the big game.

803
00:36:59,745 --> 00:37:00,432
Yeah.

804
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:01,740
Thanks.

805
00:37:01,897 --> 00:37:02,823
Maybe some other time.

806
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:03,581
Yeah, maybe.

807
00:37:03,727 --> 00:37:04,611
Yeah, maybe.

808
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:22,432
Hey, Landry.

809
00:37:22,997 --> 00:37:23,560
Tyra.

810
00:37:26,726 --> 00:37:27,833
Listen, um...

811
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:31,060
About the other day...

812
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:33,582
- What happened...
- What other day?

813
00:37:34,598 --> 00:37:36,542
Okay, cut me a break here.
I'm not very good at this.

814
00:37:38,816 --> 00:37:39,980
I'm sorry about
what I said.

815
00:37:40,297 --> 00:37:41,862
It's not that big of a deal.
I mean---

816
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:43,023
I don't think
you're a geek.

817
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:45,951
No, just a pathetic,
you know,

818
00:37:46,065 --> 00:37:46,851
not one of your friends.

819
00:37:46,905 --> 00:37:48,400
Okay, I don't think
those things either.

820
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:52,432
I was just pissed because...

821
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:55,082
Did you think that I really
wanted to tell someone?

822
00:37:55,937 --> 00:37:56,503
Tyra?

823
00:37:57,388 --> 00:37:58,750
Well, I know why you did.

824
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,162
I was just feeling burned

825
00:38:02,377 --> 00:38:03,730
about everything that happened.

826
00:38:03,785 --> 00:38:05,072
And I took it out on you.

827
00:38:07,446 --> 00:38:08,413
I'm trying to be better

828
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:10,551
at a lot of things.

829
00:38:11,397 --> 00:38:12,713
Well, I guess that explains

830
00:38:12,716 --> 00:38:14,261
why you're getting back
with Riggins then.

831
00:38:14,365 --> 00:38:15,023
What?

832
00:38:16,457 --> 00:38:17,823
I'm not back together
with Riggins.

833
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,233
No, I'm just here
as his friend.

834
00:38:20,245 --> 00:38:21,253
Right, right,
you say that now,

835
00:38:21,328 --> 00:38:23,313
but what about
the after party,

836
00:38:23,325 --> 00:38:24,812
when all the beer
starts flowing...

837
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:26,060
And, you know,
Riggins comes in

838
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:27,343
with his cute but tragic

839
00:38:27,386 --> 00:38:28,941
Texas forever routine...
What about then?

840
00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:31,320
Okay, Tim and I
are just friends, Landry.

841
00:38:31,465 --> 00:38:32,962
You know what, I know
that this whole thing

842
00:38:32,986 --> 00:38:34,673
is none of my business
because you're a big girl

843
00:38:34,735 --> 00:38:35,740
and you can do
whatever you want.

844
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:37,580
But do you really wanna
spend the rest of your life

845
00:38:37,986 --> 00:38:39,893
with someone
that cheats on you

846
00:38:39,966 --> 00:38:40,952
and drinks all the time?

847
00:38:41,008 --> 00:38:42,853
Maybe who's just gonna end up
working at a gas station?

848
00:38:42,915 --> 00:38:44,813
And then, you know, puking all
of his paycheck up?

849
00:38:45,108 --> 00:38:45,691
Is that what you want?

850
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:47,141
You know, he's gonna
cheat on your some more,

851
00:38:47,147 --> 00:38:48,290
and then you're gonna
have a few of his...

852
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:50,251
not-so-
biologically-gifted kids.

853
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:52,191
Are you trying to make me
take back my apology right now?

854
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:52,992
'Cause it's working.

855
00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:54,102
Well, I'm sorry.

856
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:56,431
But for some reason,
I really just think

857
00:38:56,496 --> 00:38:57,783
that there's a guy out there

858
00:38:58,238 --> 00:38:59,633
that'll show up sober.

859
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,393
And that'll listen to you
whenever you talk.

860
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:02,941
And that'll actually, you know,

861
00:39:03,028 --> 00:39:05,070
respect your opinions.
And actually take care of you.

862
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,161
And actually recognize you

863
00:39:06,186 --> 00:39:07,493
for the smart and beautiful...

864
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:09,541
and caring woman
that you are, Tyra.

865
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:10,723
You know, a guy that--
that guy--

866
00:39:10,887 --> 00:39:12,131
There she is.

867
00:39:14,455 --> 00:39:15,431
What's going on, Lando?

868
00:39:15,705 --> 00:39:16,433
How are ya?

869
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:18,303
Gonna come out
for a few or what?

870
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:19,603
You know what,
I can't.

871
00:39:19,827 --> 00:39:20,483
Why not?

872
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:22,131
I just can't.

873
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:41,720
Hey.

874
00:39:41,877 --> 00:39:42,410
Hey.

875
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:44,683
How was the roast?

876
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:48,362
Buddy Garrity
stole my email joke.

877
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,483
Are you serious?

878
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:50,933
Yeah, I'm looking into
who gave it to him.

879
00:39:51,466 --> 00:39:52,780
Well, it wasn't me.

880
00:39:54,988 --> 00:39:56,010
I brought you
a piece of cake.

881
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:02,633
I missed you.

882
00:40:21,718 --> 00:40:22,993
I'm sorry to bother you,
I just...

883
00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:26,012
I just thought we should
talk about some things.

884
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:27,523
And clear some things up.

885
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:31,072
You made everything
completely clear last night

886
00:40:31,097 --> 00:40:32,250
when I saw you with Suzy.

887
00:40:32,286 --> 00:40:33,731
I know you're upset,
but I really need you to--

888
00:40:33,776 --> 00:40:34,373
I'm not upset.

889
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:37,710
I finally know
the truth about us.

890
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:40,802
You didn't have the guts
to tell me, but now I know.

891
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:42,613
And now we can both move on.

892
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:46,852
Please don't come back.

893
00:40:59,297 --> 00:41:00,092
We done fightin'?

894
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:13,663
I love you.

895
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:16,461
I respect you.

896
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:19,283
I am proud of you.

897
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:23,701
And I am in love
with you completely.

898
00:41:30,438 --> 00:41:32,132
I'm sorry for the way
all this happened.

899
00:41:37,267 --> 00:41:38,311
I'll tell you what, though.

900
00:41:41,558 --> 00:41:44,062
Austin is gonna
be good to this family.

901
00:41:46,728 --> 00:41:47,980
I know it is.

902
00:41:54,905 --> 00:41:55,783
But baby...

903
00:41:58,728 --> 00:42:00,090
I'm not going to Austin.

904
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:03,873
I can't leave here now.

905
00:42:13,127 --> 00:42:14,150
Come to bed with me.
