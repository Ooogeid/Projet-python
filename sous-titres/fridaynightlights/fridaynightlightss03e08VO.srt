1
00:00:00,-121 --> 00:00:02,063
While you're heading east,
I'll fix up this {\Garrity }house{\ real nice}.

2
00:00:02,188 --> 00:00:04,507
- We're gonna turn a major profit.
- We'll see what happens{\, OK?}.

3
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:05,980
I love you.

4
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:08,219
The girl that came here,
her name is Ally Darcy.

5
00:00:08,651 --> 00:00:11,138
I hooked up with her five years ago.
There's no way that kid's mine.

6
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:13,182
- You're not lying{\ to me}?
- I'll never lie to you.

7
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:16,301
This is my man, right here,
my soon-to-be agent, Grant Halbert.

8
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:19,480
All you gotta do is sign{\, baby. Jason, nice meeting you}.
If you're in the Big Apple, ring me up.

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,190
You get your head in this game...

10
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:24,027
- Joe, I need my quarterback.
- I'm talking to my boy.

11
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:26,404
{\All I'm asking is you to }Give the kid some room to breathe,
so I can work with him.

12
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,490
- {\It's a }Job well done, fellas!
- {\All right. So }What's next?

13
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,617
- Do we call that realtor lady?
- No, we sell the house ourselves.

14
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,662
- We got an offer on the house.
- You're kidding me? Are you serious?

15
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:38,646
- I love this life.
- You can't. That's not a cheers.

16
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:40,960
- You're just thinking out loud.
- I {\can }do what I wanna do.

17
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,092
How about this?
To...

18
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:45,714
- money!
- No, wait!

19
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:49,635
To being bad-ass
real estate guys who just...

20
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:52,431
- To money!
- To money!

21
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:56,626
- What are we gonna do with that money?
- {\Dude,}I'm calling Mindy up{\ on the phone} and {\I'm }telling her,

22
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:59,228
"{\Sweetie, }You don't ever have to shake
your ass at the Landing Strip again."

23
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,189
{\No, }I'm thinking about one or two things{\, maybe}.
Either open up an orphanage,

24
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,928
or B, I'm gonna go ahead and see how
many margaritas I can buy with 14 grand.

25
00:01:06,053 --> 00:01:08,446
- I'm in for the latter.
- I'd like to see your orphanage.

26
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:10,199
Six, you're up, go.

27
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,673
Me, I'm gonna take a little trip
to New York

28
00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:15,846
and get a job in a sports agency
with my friend Grant that I met and...

29
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:17,825
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

30
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,596
Who the hell is Grant?

31
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:23,671
He's a guy I met once.

32
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:27,173
So you're just gonna get up
and move to New York?

33
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:31,261
{\Well, }Not New York, New Jersey.
I'm gonna live in New Jersey

34
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:33,294
with Noah and Erin,
and then I'm gonna...

35
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:36,265
commute into New York
for my fancy sports agent job.

36
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:39,491
Why would you wanna leave Texas?

37
00:01:40,488 --> 00:01:42,855
'Cause it's not about Texas anymore,
it's about Erin and Noah.

38
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:46,442
OK, when do we leave, Six?

39
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:53,024
- I can't believe it.
- Isn't it great? Now listen.

40
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:54,219
Did I tell you?

41
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:57,358
It's gonna go on the market in 3 days,
which means this baby's gonna sell.

42
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:00,371
Now, everyone is gonna want this house.
So we gotta move fast.

43
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,887
I can't believe it.
It's just... This is perfect.

44
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:06,073
It's everything that Eric and I have
been talking about for so many years.

45
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:07,546
It's like my dream house.

46
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:11,327
I{\'m gonna} call the realtor, tell her
we're gonna make an offer.

47
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:13,469
No, I don't think
we should do that quite yet.

48
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:16,931
- I need to, you know...
- It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

49
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,117
Tami, it's a foreclosure.

50
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:21,718
{\I know, }It{\ does} seems like it's a good price,
but it's still...

51
00:02:21,843 --> 00:02:25,732
For us, it's probably a little bit
of a stretch, you know, financially.

52
00:02:25,902 --> 00:02:27,265
OK, look at it.

53
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,627
You deserve this.
Really, you really, really do.

54
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:32,864
And you can sell your house,
you'd have that income.

55
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:37,498
And you're the principal{\, for crying out loud}!
He's the head coach. You can do this.

56
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:38,624
You can.

57
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:42,303
I don't know that he's gonna
look at it that way necessarily.

58
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,717
So I have to leave for six months.

59
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:48,856
I'm gonna be by myself,
on the road, every night,

60
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:51,090
and possibly come back
with a broken outcome.

61
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:55,083
You know, last time I checked, you're
a cowboy, that's your job, am I right?

62
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,002
Yeah, I guess you're right.

63
00:02:58,128 --> 00:02:59,778
You sure you can't come?

64
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,311
I'd love to, but I have
this little thing called school.

65
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:06,595
Just for{\, like,} a couple of days.
You can't come for a couple of days?

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,032
I have a college interview.

67
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:10,811
It's this week.

68
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,531
Well, then you can't come.
That's important.

69
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:17,980
But I will...

70
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,454
be thinking about you
every day, and...

71
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:25,335
we'll talk all the time
on the phone, and...

72
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:27,545
you'll be back soon.

73
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,237
Right?

74
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:32,288
Yeah, I'll be back.

75
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:48,161
92 coming in, there he is!

76
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:51,284
This is for our win
last week, gentlemen.

77
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:54,028
If effort equals success,
we shouldn't have won that game.

78
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,031
Act like you've done this before,
let's go!

79
00:03:57,533 --> 00:04:00,243
No, we've been doing this
all year, let's go.

80
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,245
There he is. Drop it!

81
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:04,457
- Let's go.
- Lead him in!

82
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:07,041
Jesus! You gotta catch that
if it's in your hand!

83
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:11,296
There he is. Man, man, man!
Hit him inside.

84
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:14,507
Are you serious? Jamarcus,
what the hell are you doing?

85
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:17,303
- I'm running my route.
- You're supposed to run a post.

86
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,470
- You know what a post is?
- {\Man, }He threw it to me wrong.

87
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:22,001
- Coach, can I show him what a post is?
- Go ahead.

88
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:24,767
Ain't anything worse than what we've got
out there now. Jamarcus, shut up.

89
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:26,686
Blue, 8, 10!

90
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,064
Run it out, let's go!

91
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,777
That's the way.
Yes!

92
00:04:32,987 --> 00:04:34,110
We're back to 22.

93
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,946
How come our quarterback's running
routes better than our receivers, huh?

94
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:38,374
That's the way...

95
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:41,212
Brian, step up there.

96
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:48,045
Call 911!

97
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:55,381
3x08: NEW YORK, NEW YORK

98
00:04:57,178 --> 00:05:00,428
Subtitles: Team Panthers
With

99
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:03,848
benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, GillesSilb,
Ju, loky34, ouazo, tactactac

100
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:00,126
So, what's the plan?

101
00:06:03,485 --> 00:06:04,922
Six, go!

102
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,706
The plan is to get a suit
and then I go see Grant.

103
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,041
That's the same plan
we had the whole way up here.

104
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:14,752
Oh, man, a suit. Excuse me, sir.
Sorry to bother you.

105
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:17,173
Can you just let me know
where you got that suit?

106
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:18,397
Paul Stuart.

107
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,696
We need to find a Paul Stuart.

108
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:25,793
Get the hands off my cab, jackass.

109
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:31,412
You know where Paul Stuart's is?

110
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:40,747
OK, what?

111
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:52,749
- Worth it.
- Worth it.

112
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:57,792
Paul Stuart.
Let's get you suited up, Six!

113
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,380
Right here.
Do you smell that?

114
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:01,925
That's success. It's right here.

115
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:04,468
Right there. Right there!

116
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:06,353
- That's the one.
- You think so?

117
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:07,430
Look at this.

118
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:09,474
How're you doing?
{\- It is nice.}

119
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,851
- May I help you?
- What's the damage on this garb?

120
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:15,498
This is woolen cashmere
imported from London.

121
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,398
It's $1884.

122
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:24,572
- Six!
- This is it?

123
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:27,512
Two for $125.

124
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:31,954
- That works.
- You want dark or... blue?

125
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:34,396
Like, I don't know...

126
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:36,667
This isn't bad, it feels nice.

127
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:38,520
I mean, I don't know...

128
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:41,459
- {\What do you think, }You wanna try this on?
- What if she says no, Riggs?

129
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:43,508
What do you mean?
Who says no?

130
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,829
Erin.

131
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:48,264
What if Erin says no...
What if we buy these suits,

132
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:50,556
and I go and I get a job
or don't get a job,

133
00:07:50,726 --> 00:07:53,976
and I show up at her doorstep, and I ask
her to take me back, and she says no?

134
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:59,914
I don't know, man. You can play
that "what if" game all day.

135
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:02,026
I believe you're doing
the right thing.

136
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,727
I just gotta make it
so she doesn't say no.

137
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:08,825
- Suits, job...
- How're you doing{\, guys}?

138
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:11,494
How're you doing, sir?
We need two suits.

139
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:15,612
Well, I've got two for $125, and then
I've got an extra package, $200.

140
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:18,391
- What's the package?
- {\Well }You're gonna get two suits, right?

141
00:08:18,516 --> 00:08:20,753
Then you're gonna get
two shirts, two ties,

142
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:24,715
two socks, and a free
pair of shoes, for $200.

143
00:08:26,284 --> 00:08:27,802
Shive. What do you think?

144
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:30,680
No, I just want to get back out
on the field, that's all I wanna do.

145
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,686
- Two weeks for practice,
- Just relax!

146
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:35,356
- Two weeks to playoffs.
- You know what? We're gonna be fine.

147
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,268
We'll be fine, we'll work it out.

148
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:38,855
Take care of yourself, all right?

149
00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:40,560
All right, thanks.

150
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,302
- Tell the guys hello.
- I will.

151
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,170
Get a drink of water
with your little flexi-straw.

152
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:49,480
All right, see you later, buddy.

153
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,873
OK, so...

154
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:55,985
Back to business. Here's the deal.
We gotta get a coach to replace him

155
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,845
and I've been thinking maybe
Wade Aikmen would be a good choice.

156
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,368
What are you talking about,
Wade Aikmen?

157
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:03,792
I'm just speaking
on behalf of the boosters.

158
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:06,066
When you say boosters,
you're talking about Joe McCoy.

159
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:08,761
- I don't wanna talk about that crap{\right now}.
- No, I understand that.

160
00:09:08,886 --> 00:09:11,372
I don't wanna talk about smiling Joe
either. This is not about him.

161
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:14,694
This is about Wade Aikmen
being a perfect fit at this moment.

162
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:17,173
He's the kid's personal
quarterback coach,

163
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:20,354
he knows the kid, he's been working
with him{\the kid}, he knows our spread offense.

164
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:22,854
He's young, he's energetic,
he can pick this up,

165
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,324
- and we can still...
- {\You know what? }Do me a favor, would you?

166
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,653
You tell the boosters
that I'll handle this my way.

167
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:29,874
Always.

168
00:09:30,658 --> 00:09:33,576
I'm excited about Western for you.
They actually

169
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:36,372
hold a side opening specifically

170
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:39,190
for kids just like you,
who didn't necessarily have

171
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:41,667
the best GPA's at the beginning
but have pulled them up.

172
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:45,039
You're not being given anything.
There's no hand-out here.

173
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:48,799
This is {\just}about you and your hard work.
{\And I think }It's gonna be a perfect match for you.

174
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:51,421
I feel good,
and I feel focused, and...

175
00:09:51,912 --> 00:09:53,429
I'm ready, I'm ready for this.

176
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:56,154
I'm proud of you.

177
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,946
Proud of you.
Proud of you for staying focused.

178
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:01,762
You've worked hard,
gone against a lot of odds.

179
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,320
I'm proud of you.

180
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:07,392
Thank you.

181
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,170
Coach.

182
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:17,119
Here's those...

183
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:19,072
Tennessee charts.

184
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,040
Good, Matt. Thanks.

185
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:23,889
- Hey, how's...
- Julie!

186
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,764
How's Coach McGill doing?

187
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:28,714
He's doing good.
I'll tell him you say hello.

188
00:10:29,014 --> 00:10:30,286
Thanks.

189
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:34,680
Coach...
- Julie!

190
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,313
What do you think
about the idea of...

191
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:42,888
me maybe moving
over to receiver.

192
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,138
I mean, I know all the routes.

193
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:48,618
And I just kind of think
I probably would be

194
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:52,123
- a bigger help to the team...
- Matt, you get yourself injured...

195
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:54,782
J.D. gets himself injured,
I'm out of a quarterback, I'm screwed.

196
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,976
Are you ready to go?

197
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,392
- Where're you going?
- We're gonna go hang out.{\You'll be back for dinner?}

198
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:09,547
- Got your cell phone? Have a good time.
- Yes, I have my cell phone.

199
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:11,982
See you later, Coach.

200
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,727
I'm here to see...

201
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:24,544
Mr. Grant Halbert.

202
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,856
- What is your name?
- Jason Street.

203
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:29,317
Do you have an appointment,
Mr. Street?

204
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:34,238
No, ma'am.
I don't.

205
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:36,741
OK, {\well, }if you'd like to call back
and make an appointment.

206
00:11:36,911 --> 00:11:39,079
I don't have an appointment but I...

207
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:42,831
I do know that when I met Mr. Halbert
in Texas just a little while ago,

208
00:11:42,956 --> 00:11:45,541
he told me specifically to come
see him when I came to New York

209
00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:48,669
and that's why I'm here now.

210
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,553
I'm sure if you just
let him know Jason Street...

211
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,584
would like to see him,
I'm sure he'd love to have me.

212
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:57,409
Just Jason Street, just...

213
00:11:58,861 --> 00:11:59,941
Please.

214
00:12:02,147 --> 00:12:04,397
There's a Mr. Jason Street here.

215
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:10,733
- I'm Wendell Foley's friend from Texas.
- He's Wendell's friend from Texas.

216
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:12,778
There you go.

217
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,188
Hey, Jason.

218
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:20,034
- Hey, Mr. Halbert.
- What are you doing here?

219
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:23,314
I just... You said to come see you
when I was in New York...

220
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,247
I'm here now, so...
I figured I'd stop by.

221
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:26,975
All right...

222
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:30,354
Let's go back in the office
and talk a little bit.

223
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:32,493
I will be right here.

224
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:35,499
Thank you so much
for your help, ma'am.

225
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:40,869
So I understand
we only met once, sir, but...

226
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:43,171
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said about

227
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,352
being a sports agent, and how...

228
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:48,812
- it's the next best thing to playing...{\and I would love to...}
- Jackson! Stop, son.

229
00:12:49,192 --> 00:12:51,382
- It's Jason, sir.
- Quit doing this to yourself.

230
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:54,158
I can start at the bottom,
there's really...

231
00:12:54,283 --> 00:12:56,419
It's not a problem,
I can work my way up.

232
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:58,994
You're living in a dream world,
brother.

233
00:12:59,415 --> 00:13:01,751
This is the big time,
it's New York city. It's not Dillon

234
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:05,536
where you {\go }get a job at a car dealership
just because you know all the boosters.

235
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:09,844
Do you have any idea who applies
for the entry level positions?

236
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,503
- No, sir.
- They're Harvard graduates.

237
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:14,678
I'm not kidding you about that.

238
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:17,091
It was a miracle
I got my ass in here.

239
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,427
And it's gonna be a miracle
if I get to stay.

240
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:22,557
Your buddy Wendell?

241
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,348
He screwed me over. He told
he was going to sign with me.

242
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:29,629
And then he goes out and gets courted
by SCI, who's the biggest,

243
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:32,280
glossiest sports talent agency
in this city.

244
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,260
Didn't even call me.

245
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:38,930
Son, the only reason
I let you into this office today

246
00:13:39,055 --> 00:13:42,567
is because I was looking for {\some }information
about Wendell that would help me out.

247
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:43,894
That's it.

248
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:50,958
- Well, thank you for your time.
- Welcome to New York City, son.

249
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:01,635
Just eat one more bite, sweetheart.

250
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:03,945
One more...
Oh, honey pie...

251
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,405
I gotta tell you,
Buddy just pisses me off.

252
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:10,714
Getting Wade out there
for Joe McCoy, that's just...

253
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,438
I don't get it,
and it pisses me off.

254
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:15,897
I know but you know what? Here's one
thing you might want to think about.

255
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,776
You are gonna need
a replacement for Mac.

256
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,697
And you know,
Wade is good with J.D.,

257
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:23,449
and you're gonna need J.D. to be good
in order to get in the playoffs.

258
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:25,085
One more bite...

259
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,912
- Well, thank you very much.
- Well, I'm just saying

260
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:31,264
you're going to have to replace Mac
and it might be the lesser of two evils.

261
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:34,008
'Cause you know
he'd be a good replacement.

262
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:36,378
- That's my sweet girl.
- Maybe I ought to hire you.

263
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:39,506
Thank you, that'd be good.
Honey, that looks delicious, thank you.

264
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:42,166
Well, you know, I actually

265
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:44,484
wanted to talk to you
about something.

266
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:47,181
Because I went and saw this house
the day before yesterday

267
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:49,747
that's about to go on the market...

268
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:53,113
and I have to tell you, honey,

269
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,963
I know we have not talked
about this in a long time,

270
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:57,487
but this house...

271
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:00,194
I walked in, and I thought,
"This is our future."

272
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:03,614
You would have a place for an office,
we'd have a yard for Gracie Belle.

273
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:07,775
- I {\just }thought to myself, this could be{\ the perfect}...
- Did you find this house by yourself?

274
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,912
No, I went with Katie McCoy.

275
00:15:10,355 --> 00:15:12,841
Yeah, 'cause you know,
she{\does a little...,} dabbles in a little

276
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:15,287
- real estate and she heard about it.
- She heard about that?

277
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:16,252
Honey...

278
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,046
- I'm just asking.
- {\Well, }I'm just telling you about this house

279
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:22,485
because I was {\really }excited about it and I'd
love for you to go look at it with me{\this week}.

280
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,471
We need to kind of go soon

281
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:27,979
'cause it's gonna go on the market
and it's gonna go like that. Please?

282
00:15:28,104 --> 00:15:29,146
Please?

283
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:36,023
Hon?

284
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:42,688
I cannot believe that I actually

285
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:45,364
went into Grant's office
and expected him to give me a job.

286
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,628
I'm an idiot in a wheelchair, which is
the {\only }reason he{\ even} let me in that office

287
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:52,543
because he remembered the wheelchair.
That's all everybody remembers me for{\, man}.

288
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:56,041
- The wheelchair.
- {\OK, }You know what? Drop the violin, Six.

289
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:59,475
OK, let's take a beat, here.
Where are we right now? Where are we?

290
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,297
- Time Square.
- Time Square, Big Apple.

291
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:03,548
Taking a big bite out of it.

292
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,671
You know what else we got?
We got Gypsy tonight.

293
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:09,179
- There's strippers in it.
- I don't wanna see Gypsy.

294
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,652
- What do you mean{\ you don't wanna see Gipsy}?
- My life's falling apart around me{\, Riggins}, OK?

295
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:16,577
Last thing I wanna do is go see
a Broadway show for 3 hours with you.

296
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:20,672
"You feel that you're watching a woman
who has peeled down

297
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:24,695
- to her unadorned id."
- Riggs!

298
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,863
- What?
- I'm sorry but it's not working.

299
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,781
I appreciate the fact you're trying
to cheer me up, but it's not gonna work.

300
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,497
The only thing that'll{\s gonna} cheer me up
is having my boy in my arms,

301
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:35,897
and it doesn't look like it's gonna
happen any time soon.

302
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:39,331
You know what?
You want your boy in your arms?

303
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:43,964
Go... Go grab Wendell,

304
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:47,551
bring him back to that agency,
make him sign there.

305
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:51,350
'Cause {\you know what? }you're the only person
that's gonna be able to do that.

306
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:54,892
You know what you'll get out of it?
A job {\that }they won't be able to deny you.

307
00:16:55,976 --> 00:16:58,520
And some leverage.
And that's all you need, right now.

308
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:01,231
So, wait, you want me
to go down to Penn A&M

309
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:04,398
and convince Wendell
that he's making a mistake, 'cause...

310
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,446
I mean, he is making a mistake,
he's making a huge mistake.

311
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,647
That's brilliant, Riggs!

312
00:17:13,037 --> 00:17:15,204
- Do it!
- So guess what we're doing tomorrow?

313
00:17:15,524 --> 00:17:17,608
Right after Gypsy tonight, then.

314
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:20,904
Good practice, good hustle.

315
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,170
- You ready, bud?
- I don't think we're gonna practice{\, today}.

316
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,753
- What? Are you joking?
- I{\'m gonna} take you get something to eat. {\Go get changed.}

317
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:31,053
- I'm not. Go! I'm serious.
- Really?

318
00:17:31,223 --> 00:17:33,639
- All right.
- I'll be here waiting on you.

319
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:36,182
Do me a favor, would you?

320
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:39,593
Be easy on him.
Give him some rest, right now.

321
00:17:39,718 --> 00:17:41,563
Yeah, I just told him that.

322
00:17:42,592 --> 00:17:44,558
I'm gonna take him to Applebee's.

323
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:45,817
Listen...

324
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:49,983
I bring you out here
as assistant coach,

325
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:53,216
what do you think about that?
Mind you, it'd be temporary.

326
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:56,170
I'm talking about
just until Mac gets back.

327
00:17:56,295 --> 00:17:57,579
- So we're clear.
- Sure.

328
00:17:58,195 --> 00:18:02,000
If that were to happen, J.D. can have
{\absolutely }no special treatment out here.

329
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,294
- We can agree on that?
- I think we agree on that.

330
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:08,473
- Work over {\the rest of }the details later?
- Sounds good to me.

331
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:12,734
I'll see you out here tomorrow.

332
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:18,461
Does your dad, like...

333
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:21,311
- not like me anymore?
- Why would you say that?

334
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:25,193
{\I don't know.} It seems like ever since
I got mad about him benching me,

335
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,693
he's been mad at me,
like he's holding a grudge{\ or something}.

336
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:31,831
Is this about the whole him not letting
you play wide receiver thing?

337
00:18:33,305 --> 00:18:34,448
Kinda.

338
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,703
My dad's really stubborn, sometimes.
You just...

339
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:39,329
{\You really just }need to work on him.

340
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,290
- Be persistent about it.
- Really?

341
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,409
Yeah.
I mean, it works for me.

342
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:47,171
Doesn't that get annoying?

343
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:51,343
I'm just really proud of you,

344
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:54,720
really impressed you're gonna do this{\ thing},
even though Cash is leaving.

345
00:18:55,698 --> 00:18:58,073
I'm... I'm gonna miss
that boy around here.

346
00:18:58,198 --> 00:19:00,008
Mama, he's coming back.

347
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,103
Baby!

348
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:05,834
He's a cowboy.
He's gonna do the rodeo circuit.

349
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:08,994
He's gonna have about
fifty women a day, in their...

350
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:13,126
tight, painted-on-their-ass jeans
throwing themselves at him.

351
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,201
Well, Cash isn't like that, so...
I'm not worried.

352
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:18,571
It's...

353
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:23,379
He's a cowboy.

354
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:32,447
Tyra Collette?

355
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:36,928
- Come on in.
- {\I actually... }I need to take this real quick.

356
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:39,640
- Do you mind?
- No, sure. Go ahead.

357
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:41,575
- Thank you.
- All right.

358
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:45,122
<i>Hey, baby girl.</i>

359
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:47,564
Hey. I've been trying to reach you
all day.

360
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:51,475
I know, sorry{\, baby}. I've been packing up
all day, but I was gonna call you and...

361
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,153
{\wanted to }tell you {\how much }I was gonna miss you.

362
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:54,778
Me too.

363
00:19:55,838 --> 00:19:56,838
Can I...

364
00:19:58,838 --> 00:20:01,331
- Can I ask you something?
- You should know that by now,

365
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:03,002
you can ask me anything.

366
00:20:04,043 --> 00:20:05,744
Are you gonna be faithful to me?

367
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:08,544
Come on{\, Tyra}. Am I gonna be faithful to you?
What kind of question is that?

368
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:16,121
<i>Damn.{\ All right, look,} I'm just gonna be honest
with you{\baby} 'cause I love you.</i>

369
00:20:17,644 --> 00:20:19,395
Being on the road is hard.

370
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:23,017
It's real hard.
I'm gonna be gone, like, six months.

371
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:26,019
A lot of long and cold nights,
I'm gonna be by myself.

372
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:29,405
I mean...

373
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:31,196
I'm gonna try.

374
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:34,841
I'm gonna try my best to be
faithful to you 'cause I love you.

375
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,372
I gotta go.
I have my interview.

376
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:40,939
<i>All right, good luck.</i>

377
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:03,178
- I'm Tyra Collette.
- Laura Davidson. Have a seat.

378
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,442
So let's just start with you
telling me a little bit about yourself.

379
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:17,129
Well, I'm from Dillon,

380
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:19,472
I'm 17,

381
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:22,326
and I would love...

382
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,317
to go to college.

383
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,636
Have you heard from Mrs. Davidson?

384
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:43,718
I did, I did, and...

385
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,058
you know, I think it went fine.

386
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,603
We won't know anything definitive
until after the winter break anyway,

387
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:53,744
so I think you should continue
with all your applications,

388
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:56,273
you know, give yourself
a lot of options.

389
00:21:56,645 --> 00:21:59,370
And this interview experience,
it's a learning experience,

390
00:21:59,495 --> 00:22:02,113
so keep going
with the interview process...

391
00:22:02,391 --> 00:22:04,660
But I think you're on the right track,
so I'm proud of you.

392
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:08,234
Well, OK. All right.

393
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:10,608
All right.

394
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,316
Good job, there you go.
16, come on.

395
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:21,107
Come on, 29. Pump it.

396
00:22:21,684 --> 00:22:23,973
Let's go, here we go!
Hit that one!

397
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:25,681
Good job, 82!
Come on, 16. Come on!

398
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:28,349
Come on, 16, get back in line.

399
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:32,277
Good job. Get over here.
13, 29, step up.

400
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:35,169
Now watch...
Ready, 13?

401
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:36,941
How's that front block drill going?

402
00:22:37,113 --> 00:22:39,795
{\It's going }Good. We're gonna do receiver{\, right now}.
I learned some stuff

403
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,940
at a coaching clinic at USC,
and they seem to like it.

404
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:45,774
What's Matt doing {\over }here? You realize
he gets hurt and J.D.'s not available,

405
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:48,754
- I'm {\pretty much }stuck with seventh graders.
- I know, Coach. I'm playing him wide,

406
00:22:48,874 --> 00:22:50,998
he's not gonna get hurt.
I won't let him get hit.

407
00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:55,764
{\I tell you what. }This isn't USC, so let's stick
to the drills we talked about.

408
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:58,668
Let's get him back to quarterback.
What do you say?

409
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:00,824
Matt, get that jersey back on!

410
00:23:02,553 --> 00:23:04,553
Saracen, get back over there, now.

411
00:23:09,627 --> 00:23:11,475
Hey, Coach. How're you doing?

412
00:23:12,403 --> 00:23:15,777
Listen, I heard you hired Wade,
and I just wanted to say that...

413
00:23:15,902 --> 00:23:18,980
I'm glad you decided to set aside
our differences and...

414
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:20,888
do what's best for the team.

415
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:25,342
- Good.
- Good.

416
00:23:25,713 --> 00:23:27,743
- You have a good night.
- You too, bud.

417
00:23:27,913 --> 00:23:30,065
I think it's, like, four bathrooms.

418
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,621
Isn't that crazy?
It's pretty great, right?

419
00:23:32,838 --> 00:23:35,103
I just love this kitchen.
And the backyard!

420
00:23:35,223 --> 00:23:37,209
Look at that backyard, honey!
And that grill!

421
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:40,949
Can't you just see little Gracie Belle
playing back there,

422
00:23:41,074 --> 00:23:43,007
you throwing the ball with Jules...

423
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:45,193
Is that our Julie,
or is there gonna be another?

424
00:23:45,318 --> 00:23:48,080
You know what I mean. We can have
parties, we can have the barbecue,

425
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:49,972
we can have the football party
back here...

426
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,637
You know...

427
00:23:55,336 --> 00:23:56,380
Come here.

428
00:24:00,514 --> 00:24:01,574
Talk to me.

429
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,112
We cannot afford this.

430
00:24:05,886 --> 00:24:07,448
Well, I mean, I know it's a stretch.

431
00:24:07,717 --> 00:24:10,327
Babe, we can't afford it.

432
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:12,116
Before you say that,

433
00:24:12,241 --> 00:24:15,082
- can we at least have a conversation?
- We are having a conversation.

434
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:17,568
I know, but I think we need
to sit down with our finances.

435
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:21,295
- This could be a great investment.
- Our mortgage would double.

436
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:23,628
Hon, I know, but the point
that I'm making is that

437
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,884
I feel like we are expanding.
I think that we actually could do it.

438
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:29,096
Listen.
What happens if I lose my job?

439
00:24:29,825 --> 00:24:31,083
Think about that.

440
00:24:31,788 --> 00:24:35,644
- You're gonna win the playoffs.
- What happens if you lose your job?

441
00:24:36,296 --> 00:24:38,546
- Why would you say that?
- Because you could lose your job.

442
00:24:38,671 --> 00:24:40,217
I could lose my job.

443
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:43,188
- That is the most pessimistic way{\ to think}...
- {\Honey, }I'm not being pessimistic,

444
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:45,307
I'm being realistic.
We cannot afford this.

445
00:24:45,432 --> 00:24:47,988
I'm trying to think about our lives
and not think about it

446
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,070
in terms of gloom and doom, and OK,

447
00:24:50,195 --> 00:24:52,284
we gotta stay put in one place
our whole lives.

448
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:53,912
{\You know, }This is our dream house.

449
00:24:54,214 --> 00:24:57,799
- That's what we need to {\be }think{\ing} about.
- You know what you just said? "Our.{\ Our.}"

450
00:24:58,329 --> 00:24:59,960
That means the two of us.

451
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,628
As far as my side is concerned,
I say no.

452
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:05,674
- Don't just say no.
- You want me to just say yes?

453
00:25:05,996 --> 00:25:08,509
No! But don't just say no,

454
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:10,956
without us having
a conversation about it.

455
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:12,463
Where are you going?

456
00:25:12,588 --> 00:25:15,531
- Me? I'm gonna go outside.
- You're just gonna walk out?

457
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:18,519
I'm just going out
to get some fresh air, sweetie.

458
00:25:20,056 --> 00:25:21,056
Sorry.

459
00:25:22,532 --> 00:25:24,964
There it is, Asbury Hall.

460
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:27,571
That's where they said
Wendell's dorm is.

461
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:30,092
I sure hope he's here,

462
00:25:30,504 --> 00:25:33,314
'cause if he's not, we're gonna have
to sit on the doorstep till he shows up.

463
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:37,409
{\You know, }If this actually goes through...
when it actually all goes through,

464
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,546
you're gonna have to live here...

465
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:41,875
for, like... for good.

466
00:25:43,246 --> 00:25:44,823
Yeah, that's the plan.

467
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:47,089
It is.

468
00:25:48,526 --> 00:25:50,573
Why? Does it bother you
a little bit?

469
00:25:56,696 --> 00:26:00,696
I'll be back to visit{\, man}. It's not like
I'm not gonna be back in Dillon at all.

470
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:04,901
All right, well...

471
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:07,766
I'm going in there alone.
I'm gonna talk to him.

472
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:09,924
Stay out here
and don't get in trouble.

473
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:12,088
- All right.
- I'll go get this guy.

474
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:14,610
- No regrets.
- See you in a few.

475
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:39,509
Heard you're not going to sign
with Grant anymore?

476
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:41,340
Man, I think that's cool...

477
00:26:41,694 --> 00:26:45,312
if that's really what you wanna do,
if you've really thought about it,

478
00:26:45,702 --> 00:26:48,652
if you really see the big picture here,
but I don't think you do.

479
00:26:53,052 --> 00:26:54,531
What're you talking about?

480
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:57,333
I don't think you see the fact
that this bigger agency,

481
00:26:57,693 --> 00:26:59,686
you're just another athlete
on paper to them.

482
00:26:59,806 --> 00:27:01,558
You're just
another paycheck to them.

483
00:27:01,683 --> 00:27:04,174
They're gonna collect
as many of you as they can

484
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:07,963
to get another BMW in their garage.
That's what you are to them.

485
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,759
You need someone who's young, someone
who's smart, someone who's ambitious,

486
00:27:12,884 --> 00:27:15,804
{\someone }who's gonna put all their attention
on you, all their passion into you,

487
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:18,834
and all their drive behind making you,
because making you

488
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:20,891
is gonna make them.
That's what you need.

489
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:24,246
- And... Grant is that person?
- I think so.

490
00:27:24,371 --> 00:27:26,355
You're gonna be his present,
{\You're gonna be }his future.

491
00:27:26,736 --> 00:27:28,580
You're gonna be
his kids' college fund.

492
00:27:28,705 --> 00:27:32,247
You'll{\re gonna} be the reason he's able to put
dinner on his family's table every night

493
00:27:32,372 --> 00:27:36,365
and he's gonna work harder for you
because of that, because of his family.

494
00:27:36,537 --> 00:27:40,026
Because when success is essential
to keeping your family together,

495
00:27:40,151 --> 00:27:43,390
there's nothing a man will not do.

496
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:44,841
OK?

497
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:51,103
All I'm saying is,
give him a shot.

498
00:27:51,732 --> 00:27:53,937
Go and talk to him,
he can get the job done.

499
00:27:54,062 --> 00:27:57,094
He's been trying to get ahold of you,
and you've been ignoring him.

500
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:01,760
Jason, what would you get
out of this, dude?

501
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:05,596
I want Grant to give me a job.

502
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:11,108
But I also want to see you succeed.

503
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:15,332
So on my way back home,
I figured I'd come down here

504
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:17,072
and tell you
you're making a mistake.

505
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,093
I could've just...

506
00:28:20,218 --> 00:28:23,397
gone back to Dillon and said,
I didn't get a job in the city,

507
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:24,901
and...

508
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:29,668
Wendell's making a mistake, and I{\ really} hope
he makes it, and just left it at that.

509
00:28:31,004 --> 00:28:32,339
I could've done that, but...

510
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:37,996
You know me. I'm not the type of guy
who just leaves things at that.

511
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,874
There's no one else like you, man.

512
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:48,313
I'm counting on that.

513
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:56,322
You couldn't even wait till my body
got cold before you replaced me.

514
00:28:57,355 --> 00:28:58,661
With the playoffs coming up,

515
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:00,824
I gotta have some help{\ somehow}.
I'm not replacing you.

516
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:02,176
Wade Aikmen?

517
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:05,789
- He's Joe McCoy's boy, you know that.
- Everything's understood.

518
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:08,655
Until you come back,
he's interim.

519
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,961
You got a fox in the henhouse,
that's what you got yourself.

520
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:16,430
- Well, we'll see about that.
- You know what that means, don't you?

521
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,619
I have Wendell Foley and
Jason Street here for you.

522
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,092
Guys?

523
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,734
Mr Halbert.

524
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:38,238
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

525
00:29:38,718 --> 00:29:40,539
- You're here to talk?
- Well...

526
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:43,520
My boy Jason brought me.
You can thank him for that.

527
00:29:45,098 --> 00:29:47,978
{\If }You think I'll let you leave this office
without {\you }coming back to me{\, man}, you're crazy.

528
00:29:48,103 --> 00:29:50,131
Come on back,
let's talk a little bit.

529
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,794
Jason,
come sit in the meeting with us.

530
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,310
I need you in here.

531
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:15,816
- {\Miss Taylor, }It's a really good chicken.
- Good, I'm glad you're enjoying it.

532
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:17,630
Nice to be complimented on the food

533
00:30:17,755 --> 00:30:20,147
that you've slaved over
after a long day at work.

534
00:30:20,896 --> 00:30:22,531
I said it was a very nice meal too{\, honey}.

535
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:24,804
- It is a good meal.
- Thank you, honey.

536
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:27,786
Dad, why don't you let Matt play
at wide receiver this year?

537
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:30,539
We don't talk football
at the dinner table.

538
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:33,293
We talk about football at breakfast,
lunch, and the dinner table.

539
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:36,434
- Sweetie{\heart}, it's none of your business.
- Drop it, just drop...

540
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:40,507
We're just a family having dinner,
talking about work, right?

541
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:45,174
I'm just saying, he deserves it.
He's worked hard for the Panthers,

542
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,367
it's his senior year,
he knows all the routes...

543
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:51,101
He thinks like a QB,
you should at least give him a shot.

544
00:30:52,955 --> 00:30:55,354
All I'm asking
is you give him a shot.

545
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:59,048
I'll tell you what, why don't we talk
about the house we can't afford?{\ Why don't you run with that one?}

546
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:01,572
I do know the routes
just as well as anybody else, Coach.

547
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:04,633
I do, I'll prove it to you too,
we can go outside and...

548
00:31:04,753 --> 00:31:08,036
Call ten... call ten routes,
I'll run 'em all, I miss one,

549
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:11,082
I'll shut up about this,
you won't hear another word about it.

550
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,667
You miss one, we never discuss it again.
You make 'em all, I'll think about it{\, that's it}.

551
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,503
Is that what you're saying?

552
00:31:16,663 --> 00:31:18,289
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

553
00:31:19,092 --> 00:31:20,799
Well, y'all, let's
finish dinner first!

554
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:29,852
Slant.

555
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,393
You're ready?
Set, hut!

556
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,696
All right!

557
00:31:37,821 --> 00:31:39,776
- Come on! Hurry up!{\ Let's go!}
- One for one!

558
00:31:40,902 --> 00:31:41,902
How about a curl?

559
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:47,741
- Slide, slide. - Yes, sir.
- Set, hut!

560
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:51,453
Skinny post. Set, hut!

561
00:31:51,824 --> 00:31:52,912
Go Matt!

562
00:31:53,906 --> 00:31:55,798
That was a good one!

563
00:31:55,923 --> 00:31:58,664
Run a slide. Try using you hands
instead of your chest!

564
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:00,219
Ready?
Set, hut!

565
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:04,633
Six out of six!

566
00:32:04,913 --> 00:32:06,845
Out and up, that's right,
I know what I'm saying.

567
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:08,155
Hut!

568
00:32:11,227 --> 00:32:12,285
That's good?

569
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,351
Yeah, you look a little slow though.

570
00:32:14,523 --> 00:32:16,294
- Your legs getting tired?
- {\No, }They're good.

571
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:18,828
- You{\'ve been} stretched 'em out?
- I {\just }haven't been using them much lately{\ on the bench}.

572
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:21,900
You{\'ve} been sitting on the bench too long,
that's what you were gonna say?

573
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:24,952
Out and up, set, hut!

574
00:32:30,563 --> 00:32:32,730
Nine per nine, one more!

575
00:32:33,002 --> 00:32:35,789
- I'm getting nervous!
- It's nine out of nine.

576
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:38,667
- I understand, I can count.
- I mean, {\it's just }one more and we're good.

577
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,296
- Pick your legs up this time.
- Yes, sir.

578
00:32:44,327 --> 00:32:45,327
Set, hut!

579
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:04,582
Come on.

580
00:33:07,534 --> 00:33:09,018
That was a piss-poor pass.

581
00:33:09,397 --> 00:33:10,490
I'll think about it.

582
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:12,659
Let's go eat.

583
00:33:13,194 --> 00:33:14,453
It's cold now.

584
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:20,216
- Have we got aspirin in the house?
- Sure we do.

585
00:33:20,341 --> 00:33:22,544
Your arm?
You haven't thrown like that in years.

586
00:33:23,888 --> 00:33:26,425
- He'll think about it...
- So me being you girlfriend,

587
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,947
does that entitle me to 10%
of all your future earnings?

588
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,098
I think it should! We should start
like a contract or something right now.

589
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:10,165
- What's all this?
- I'm going with you.

590
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:11,507
Really?

591
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:13,237
Oh, my god!

592
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:18,685
What about school?

593
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,245
What about it? Let's go!

594
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,939
- Before I change my mind.
- Let's go then, let's go!

595
00:34:23,557 --> 00:34:25,499
- You're sure about this?
- Yeah, let's go.

596
00:34:25,624 --> 00:34:26,973
OK, let's go.

597
00:34:49,945 --> 00:34:51,633
- God! Come on now!
- Honey...

598
00:34:51,983 --> 00:34:54,501
I can't stop thinking
about the house.

599
00:34:55,234 --> 00:34:58,068
- What?
- I can't stop thinking about the house.

600
00:34:58,308 --> 00:35:00,396
And I just don't like
the way we've gone into it

601
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:02,721
and I probably
handled it wrong but...

602
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:05,440
I just feel like this is something
that we need to do together,

603
00:35:06,211 --> 00:35:10,207
and it's an opportunity for us
as a couple and as a family...

604
00:35:11,806 --> 00:35:13,680
Can we just do...
Can we do something together?

605
00:35:13,805 --> 00:35:17,504
Can we just go back and
look at that house one more time?

606
00:35:17,948 --> 00:35:21,581
And say that we're going back there...
as partners,

607
00:35:21,939 --> 00:35:24,713
and look at it together,
and think about it together.

608
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,120
Think about what we want
for our family and...

609
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:30,961
what we want for our lives,
for our finances and all that, together.

610
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:41,362
- Can I turn the light off?
- I'll set it up...

611
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:44,025
- Can I turn the light off?
- Yeah, go ahead.

612
00:35:51,865 --> 00:35:54,508
- So this is all original woodwork,
- I know...

613
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:57,741
and granite tops,
they last for a lifetime.

614
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:00,285
Right? And have you seen
the view from the master?

615
00:36:02,714 --> 00:36:04,402
And I checked with the owner,

616
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:06,676
yes, the appliances
are all included in the house.

617
00:36:06,796 --> 00:36:09,675
- I know you had mentioned that{\, which is worth}...
- You're {\so }lucky to be{\ good} friends with Katie,

618
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,988
you are the first people
to have the opportunity{\ to look at this house}...

619
00:36:12,113 --> 00:36:14,299
Could you give us a second
just to talk this over?

620
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,426
- Absolutely!
- Just a little breathing room...

621
00:36:16,598 --> 00:36:18,838
No problem, my pleasure,
I'll just be right outside.

622
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:19,963
Thank you.

623
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:25,580
God, she talks a lot!

624
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,072
I know, don't let her
turn you off to the whole thing.

625
00:37:02,927 --> 00:37:04,393
Pretty great, right?

626
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:11,943
Honey, as much as I would love...

627
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,532
love... to give this to you,

628
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:20,496
and to the kids, and to myself,
it's a beautiful house,

629
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:22,437
no doubt about it.

630
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:27,395
We cannot do this.

631
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:33,746
It is a lot!

632
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:39,217
If we ended up getting this,

633
00:37:40,103 --> 00:37:43,304
I would go crazy,
I would not sleep at night.

634
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,832
Financially?

635
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,552
We cannot do this.

636
00:37:56,052 --> 00:37:57,196
I am sorry.

637
00:38:14,756 --> 00:38:16,419
I don't need this house.

638
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,362
I don't.

639
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,605
I got you and I got Jules,

640
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,745
and I got Gracie Belle,
and I got the best life.

641
00:38:26,424 --> 00:38:28,222
And I don't need this house.

642
00:38:33,972 --> 00:38:37,549
But I appreciate your coming
and looking, and being honest with me{\, and}...

643
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:41,595
That was all I cared about, just...
Whatever we do, we're doing it together.

644
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:50,310
I love you, baby.

645
00:38:51,294 --> 00:38:52,550
I love you too.

646
00:38:58,197 --> 00:38:59,994
- Oh, God...
- Excuse me.

647
00:39:00,114 --> 00:39:02,218
You know,
I have the sweetest little...

648
00:39:02,544 --> 00:39:04,836
three-bedroom, it's so cozy...

649
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:06,531
Listen you have been so sweet,

650
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:09,837
but I think we are officially not really
in the market right now.

651
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:11,559
So thank you for all your time.

652
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,217
Thank you very much,
thanks for showing us.

653
00:39:14,342 --> 00:39:16,896
I appreciate it. Thanks
for giving us your time.

654
00:39:21,853 --> 00:39:24,128
So I got this job, and I...

655
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:28,459
I need to find a place to live,
and I'd prefer for that to be with you,

656
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:30,511
and Noah...

657
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:33,554
if you'll have me.

658
00:39:33,724 --> 00:39:35,902
No, that sounds... terrible.

659
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:37,502
If, er...

660
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,512
I'd prefer for that
to be with you and Noah if...

661
00:39:40,794 --> 00:39:42,674
If that's OK... with you...

662
00:39:43,168 --> 00:39:44,260
Jason, I'm pregnant.

663
00:39:46,347 --> 00:39:48,062
- What?
- I was being...

664
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,758
- your gal.
- God, Riggs!

665
00:39:51,312 --> 00:39:53,309
What if she throws you
a curve ball like that{\, what are you gonna say}?

666
00:39:53,548 --> 00:39:56,630
What, like she's pregnant?
I could roll with that.

667
00:40:04,353 --> 00:40:05,375
Good job!

668
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,571
{\Now, }Buddy already knows this, but when Wade,
there, was throwing the rock for Tech,

669
00:40:10,696 --> 00:40:12,912
he was runner-up for the Heisman
two years in a row.

670
00:40:13,242 --> 00:40:14,694
Let's do that again!

671
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:18,412
Matt! Go in for Kendell
for wide receiver.

672
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:20,321
Let's go!

673
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,258
J.D., give him something
to work with.

674
00:40:25,203 --> 00:40:27,900
- Make them work for their money{\, let's go}!
- Blue, 80!

675
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:29,905
Blue, 80!

676
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:31,591
Set!

677
00:40:33,094 --> 00:40:34,369
Come on, come on!

678
00:40:37,195 --> 00:40:39,437
That's what I was
talking about, Wade!

679
00:40:41,295 --> 00:40:43,683
Rock and roll, baby!

680
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,151
That's it right there!

681
00:41:15,929 --> 00:41:17,830
It's a nice neighborhood, man.

682
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,017
You got it?

683
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:28,628
Yeah.

684
00:41:34,246 --> 00:41:35,246
Hey, J-6...

685
00:41:42,671 --> 00:41:44,533
I hope you get everything...

686
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,013
I hope you get everything you want.

687
00:41:50,428 --> 00:41:53,109
But no matter what happens
in there, you're...

688
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:56,851
you're always gonna be
my best friend.

689
00:41:57,608 --> 00:41:59,545
And you deserve to be happy.

690
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:02,889
Thank you.

691
00:42:19,645 --> 00:42:20,912
Texas forever?

692
00:42:25,874 --> 00:42:26,881
Texas forever.

693
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,380
All right.

694
00:42:54,297 --> 00:42:56,247
What the heck are you doing here?

695
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:00,098
I was...

696
00:43:01,823 --> 00:43:03,209
Do you mind if I hold him?

697
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:05,613
Yeah, all right.

698
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,555
- Here's your daddy, sweetheart.
- Hello, little man.

699
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:10,143
Here's your daddy.

700
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:14,930
Hey, you!

701
00:43:16,017 --> 00:43:17,637
You remember me, right?

702
00:43:20,033 --> 00:43:23,019
Erin, I made some serious changes
in my life in the last couple of weeks.

703
00:43:24,252 --> 00:43:26,950
I just got a job in the city.
In Manhattan.

704
00:43:27,587 --> 00:43:29,797
It's just an entry
level position but...

705
00:43:30,004 --> 00:43:32,372
I have my foot pretty solidly
in the door of a...

706
00:43:32,607 --> 00:43:35,203
pretty great sports agency.
And I'm...

707
00:43:36,271 --> 00:43:38,183
I'm gonna be making
about $40,000 a year,

708
00:43:38,308 --> 00:43:40,912
which I hear isn't much around
this neck of the woods, but...

709
00:43:41,963 --> 00:43:42,963
I just...

710
00:43:43,897 --> 00:43:46,411
I want you to be able
to take some time off and...

711
00:43:46,862 --> 00:43:48,793
just be with Noah and be home.

712
00:43:52,937 --> 00:43:55,861
And I'm gonna find a place to live,
and I would...

713
00:43:57,637 --> 00:44:00,434
I would really like that to be
with you and Noah...

714
00:44:02,798 --> 00:44:05,723
if that's what you want.
If that's not what you want,

715
00:44:06,278 --> 00:44:08,038
I'm still gonna find
a place close to here.

716
00:44:08,163 --> 00:44:12,099
{\You know, }Far enough away, I won't be a stalker
or anything, but close enough that...

717
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,526
Close enough that I can be here.

718
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,836
For you and for him, 'cause...

719
00:44:19,587 --> 00:44:22,019
I'm never gonna let
this baby down, ever.

720
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,083
Jason...

721
00:44:31,018 --> 00:44:32,285
I've missed you.

722
00:44:32,744 --> 00:44:34,250
I've missed you so much.

723
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:38,228
- I missed you too.
- Sweetheart, it's all good.

724
00:45:40,077 --> 00:45:43,494
All right, listen up! It's the playoffs,
gentlemen. This is where the fun begins.

725
00:45:43,664 --> 00:45:47,113
For those of you who've been out here
before, you know what I'm talking about.

726
00:45:47,387 --> 00:45:48,833
For those of you who haven't...

727
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,418
you will.

728
00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:55,052
Get out of my car.

729
00:45:56,511 --> 00:45:59,677
- Seriously?
- This is not a joke. Get out of my car.

730
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,097
Mrs. Taylor?
It's Tyra.

731
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:05,350
I'm in a little bit of trouble.
