1
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,664
They come by with a car, and I break
it down to its component parts.

2
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:14,471
- They need it turned...
- Chop shop.

3
00:00:14,596 --> 00:00:17,400
You'll make more money in two months
than you could in two years.

4
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:20,136
- I sure didn't see you coming.
- I didn't see you coming either.

5
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:21,637
I can refer you

6
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:25,087
- to the adoption agency.
- What if I don't want to have the baby?

7
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:27,109
You provided this girl
the information

8
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,712
- to get her child aborted.
- I did not, ma'am.

9
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:32,781
Get out of here!

10
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:35,117
Calvin's dead.

11
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:56,241
Bill, now you see
what we're concerned about out here?

12
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:59,074
There're about 18, 19 more holes all
throughout this field, not to mention

13
00:00:59,242 --> 00:01:00,757
all the glass that's in it.

14
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:04,914
Bill, there's a pothole over there
on the 35-yard line.

15
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:08,609
You drive your car over it,
you're gonna pop your hubcap right off.

16
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,252
When you're driving around

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,953
on the football field.
We usually don't drive around on the...

18
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:16,125
I'm not gonna put my players at risk
because they can't maintain their field.

19
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:17,326
We got playoffs...

20
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,496
We played on this field all year,
and no Lion has fallen from the pride.

21
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:25,034
Yeah, and remember, Joe, you got to win
friday night to make the playoffs.

22
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:26,882
- You got to win first.
- You gotta win.

23
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:28,971
Did I hear the voice
of a dead Panther?

24
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,675
You know, coach, you really ought
to consider investing in some turf.

25
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,374
- They've a legitimate concern here.
- Exactly. Very much so.

26
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:37,980
Let me recommend something.
It's simple.

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,776
How about a neutral field?

28
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:44,954
How about Joe's backyard?

29
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:56,715
I'm the conference director here.

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,278
The decision is on me, all right?

31
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:04,612
Coach, you feel like
you got a handle on this?

32
00:02:06,222 --> 00:02:07,749
It's saturday, the game's friday.

33
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:11,679
I can promise you this field
will be in fine shape for play by then.

34
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,084
All right, gentlemen.
We're adjourned.

35
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:18,988
Y'all know
where the parking lot is, coach.

36
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:23,929
Mom, it's a one-month training program.
They house you, they feed you.

37
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:26,250
They bring in
amazing people to speak.

38
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,906
- And Jimmy Carter's part of Habitat.
- I know who Jimmy Carter is, honey.

39
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:31,867
Well, do they know how old you are?

40
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,137
'Cause I think that could be
an issue for you.

41
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:37,882
Well, by the time I'm completely done
with the training program, I'll be 18,

42
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:40,483
and normally, they don't make
this kind of offer to somebody my age,

43
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:42,111
but I wrote a really amazing essay.

44
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:45,149
I have prior work experience,
great recommendations...

45
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:48,050
All right. Where, when,
how long, and how much?

46
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:53,388
It'll be in New Orleans
in about three weeks.

47
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:56,288
What? Honey, no.

48
00:02:56,413 --> 00:02:58,460
- Mom, it's only $3,000.
- Only?

49
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:00,462
Honey, you're hilarious.

50
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,931
Half of it they'll pick up
with grant money,

51
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,034
and I have $500 saved up,
and if I pass my government class,

52
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:09,905
I can graduate this semester,
and next semester I was only gonna take

53
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:12,771
- electives anyways.
- No, no, no, and no.

54
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:16,186
It's wonderful that you like Habitat
so much, but you're finishing school.

55
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:18,747
- You haven't looked at the brochures.
- I need your help.

56
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:22,918
Would you go grab those things and start
working on that stove, please? Thanks.

57
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:31,942
Hey, little man.

58
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,563
Hey, buddy.
Come on up!

59
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,345
Good boy.

60
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,767
- Brought you your dog back.
- I see that.

61
00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:42,337
Mom hates him even more now.

62
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:45,607
- She says he reminds her of you.
- I'll take that as a compliment.

63
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:47,909
I think that's how she meant it.

64
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:51,495
Brought you your stuff.

65
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,552
- My mom threw it out.
- Well, that was nice of her.

66
00:03:55,677 --> 00:03:58,487
She's mad. Never pictured you
as a snow globe kind of guy.

67
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:03,054
My mom gave me that one.

68
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:09,100
I got to get that.

69
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:10,225
Yeah.

70
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:15,103
Riggins' Rigs.

71
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:17,305
The baby's coming!
The baby's on its way.

72
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:19,775
- Who are you talking to?
- It's Tim. You wanna talk to him?

73
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:21,109
No. We practiced this!

74
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:23,879
No, for real d-day?
She's gonna pop or what?

75
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:26,137
Like, for real, the baby is, like...

76
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:28,817
Hang up the phone
and take me to the hospital!

77
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:30,914
- <i>Where are my keys?</i>
- All right.

78
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,573
What is it?

79
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:36,825
I'm becoming an uncle today.

80
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:39,728
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now. I gotta go.

81
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:42,697
- Let's just go. I don't care!
- I got to put my pants on!

82
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,133
Mindy! Mindy,
you can't drive right now.

83
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:47,302
My boots.
There's my pants.

84
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,704
I'm coming!
Mindy, wait, wait, wait.

85
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,847
I wish he would have
been more like you, Vincent.

86
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:33,815
No...

87
00:05:34,194 --> 00:05:36,718
I wish he would have stayed
on the team.

88
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:39,105
No, it just happened.

89
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,131
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:43,644
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,760
He loved you.

92
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,378
He loved all of us.

93
00:05:56,763 --> 00:05:58,306
Did you speak to the cops yet?

94
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:03,445
Jess, if I go to the cops,
I go to jail.

95
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,391
I don't see my mom no more.

96
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:09,060
I don't see her get better, nothing.

97
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:12,887
Vince, you were in the car.
You did not do a thing wrong.

98
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,592
It doesn't matter.

99
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:16,591
Look, I know I laid a lot
on you last night.

100
00:06:16,988 --> 00:06:19,728
That was wrong of me, I shouldn't
have done that. It was stupid.

101
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:21,189
No, no, no.
Look,

102
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,964
I'm glad you came to me.

103
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:25,597
I got to trust you.

104
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:30,338
You can't say nothing to nobody
about anything.

105
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:33,299
You know I won't.

106
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:40,448
I gotta go.

107
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:50,658
What's going on, man?

108
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,915
You getting any heat on this?

109
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,898
Nah.

110
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:04,606
You ready for payback?

111
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,592
I'm done.

112
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:26,798

- <i>Who's got something to say out there?</i>
- <i>I got something to say, Sammy.</i>

119
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:30,091
<i>I say that Eric Taylor better
enjoy his turkey on thursday,</i>

120
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:32,627
<i>'cause friday's gonna be
his comeuppance.</i>

121
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:36,130
<i>He quit on the Panthers twice, and on
his own team the 1st game of the season?</i>

122
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:39,562
- <i>Stole that boy Cafferty from us.</i>
- Why don't you turn that stuff off?

123
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,053
<i>... playoffs, this game
shouldn't even matter.</i>

124
00:08:42,178 --> 00:08:43,638
<i>But it's all good, 'cause he's...</i>

125
00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:47,578
What?

126
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:07,054
What?

127
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,676
- <i>You're a baby killer, Tami Taylor.</i>
- Who is this?

128
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,942
<i>You're gonna burn in hell
for what you've done.</i>

129
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:30,240
- Hey, there, Jess.
- Landry?

130
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:32,803
How's it going?

131
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:42,897
Yeah, I've been Standing here for about
20 minutes, trying to perfect this pose.

132
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:49,798
I just didn't want you to think that
just because of our scandalous romance,

133
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,840
I had forgotten about the debt
that I owed you, so...

134
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,359
It's not exactly the...

135
00:09:59,984 --> 00:10:01,749
The response that I was looking for.

136
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:04,085
No, it's... It's great.
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:07,618
You know, my mind's just...
We're going to church service right now,

138
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,132
'cause, you know, Calvin Brown,
he got shot the other night,

139
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:12,560
and, you know, he died.

140
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:18,610
Calvin brown, Vince's friend?
The one...

141
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:19,878
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:22,313
And so I'm... You know,
I'm just, like...

143
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:24,916
No, I'm sorry.
This is not the best timing.

144
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,842
You should have shut me up
a long time ago.

145
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,888
I bet you are Landry.

146
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:31,889
Yes, ma'am.
How you doing?

147
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:34,215
- Landry Clarke.
- I'm good. I'm Bird.

148
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,778
Pleased to meet you.

149
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,585
Got a lock for that bike?

150
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:40,054
No, ma'am, I do not.

151
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:43,322
She gonna need a lock for that bike.

152
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:46,260
Gonna need a lock for it.

153
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:48,863
- I should have thought about that.
- Thank you.

154
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:53,777
I-I'll call you.

155
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:55,081
Okay.

156
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:06,280
All right, let's load this one up.
Take it up to that spot.

157
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,384
Come on, we need some pressure.
We need some pressure.

158
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,689
Hey, coach.

159
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:15,658
Coach Crowley said we're gonna practice
at Carroll Park?

160
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:17,291
Yeah, everybody except for you.

161
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,459
Hey, Stan!

162
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,661
Stan, where's Tim Riggins?

163
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:22,596
His brother's having a baby
with his wife.

164
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:25,899
His brother's having a baby? How come
you know that and I don't know that?

165
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,735
I left you a note on your desk.

166
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:29,919
This is gonna be a bad week.
Don't leave notes.

167
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:31,965
You got something to say,
say it face-to-face.

168
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,307
- Face-to-face.
- Great.

169
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:36,110
- His brother's having a baby...
- Yeah, I understand. Thanks very much.

170
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,842
- What do you mean everybody except...
- 'Cause of your hip.

171
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:41,248
I'm fine, coach. I can play through.
I can gut it out.

172
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:44,279
 You want to gut it out? Why don't you
gut it out and fill up the gatorade jug?

173
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,619
That'd be just fine.

174
00:11:46,342 --> 00:11:48,030
- I want five!
- Thanks, coach.

175
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:49,505
This looks great.

176
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,958
This looks real good.

177
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:52,288
It's very smooth.

178
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:53,861
- You're gonna like it.
- Great.

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Hey, Luke.

180
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:01,168
Come here.

181
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:11,067
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:13,756 --> 00:12:16,483
- Appreciate that.
- As far as the work I want you to do,

183
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:19,450
is I want you to take care of your hip.
That's the only work I want you doing.

184
00:12:20,154 --> 00:12:21,822
Hey, put that jug down.

185
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:24,691
Appreciate it.
Thank you.

186
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:26,787
All right, coach.

187
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,730
Just seems like we're making
a bigger mess than...

188
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,014
Fill that jug up.

189
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:36,970
This place is ridiculous.
When did you get here?

190
00:12:37,138 --> 00:12:40,207
- What happened?
- I'm going nuts. They threw me out!

191
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,309
- What do you mean?
- Nurse Ratched threw me out.

192
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:45,045
She said I was too enthusiastic,
whatever that's supposed to mean.

193
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:46,563
What'd Mindy say?

194
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:50,350
Mindy said, "Get the hell out." Well,
no, Mindy screamed, "Get the hell out."

195
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:54,026
It's ridiculous. I got a baby being born
and I can't even be inside with them.

196
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:55,322
I'm going nuts, Tim!

197
00:12:55,617 --> 00:12:59,092
- And how many of those have you drank?
- What does it have to do with anything?

198
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,495
- I don't know. Five?
- Five?

199
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,275
Here, you're cut off.

200
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,665
- Why?
- You're cut off.

201
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:06,783
Come on...

202
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:08,135
Fine.

203
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:13,811
What?
This isn't funny, Tim.

204
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:15,905
Let's go, let's go!

205
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,060
Let's get this chalk down!

206
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,913
Come on, stay with me.

207
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:26,748
What's up, coach?
This is a baseball field.

208
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,522
It's a football field now.
Let's go!

209
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,434
Vince, I'm sorry to hear
about your friend...

210
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:40,775
You know, it's got to be tough.

211
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,403
What do you care for?
You didn't even know his last name.

212
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:45,934
Calvin Brown, and...

213
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,359
and I care about my teammates,

214
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:50,690
and you're my teammate, so...

215
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,030
Hey, Landry, thanks.

216
00:13:56,217 --> 00:13:57,951
Bring it up.
Helmets on. Let's go!

217
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,342
- Let's go!
- All right, listen up.

218
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:03,557
This is the field we're gonna be using
this week, understood?

219
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:06,059
You pissed off?
I'm pissed off too.

220
00:14:06,227 --> 00:14:07,377
Good. Use it.

221
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:11,129
What's this bull I hear on the radio
about them not letting us use our field?

222
00:14:11,254 --> 00:14:14,401
Don't worry about the damn radio.
We've heard all that crap before.

223
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:16,604
Listen to me.
Word of the week...

224
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:18,326
Focus.

225
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:20,966
Is that understood?

226
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:23,777
Is that understood?
Let's break it down.

227
00:14:33,354 --> 00:14:35,790
I ain't gonna have any knees left
for this Friday.

228
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:37,127
Shut up, Tinker, man.

229
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,060
If I can do this with my hip,
you can do it with your knees.

230
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:42,662
Yo, man, whose idea
was this, anyway?

231
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:44,179
Landry's.

232
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:48,468
Yes, it was my idea.
Thank you for pointing that out.

233
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:51,720
And a brilliant idea, 'cause if we can't
practice on our field,

234
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:54,774
then they're not gonna practice
on their field, end of story.

235
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:04,404
- How are you?
- Just fine.

236
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,529
Good.

237
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,844
- Can I talk to you?
- Come on in.

238
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:09,492
It won't take but a moment.

239
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:13,226
Shoot,
you live at least 50 miles away.

240
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:16,421
It must be something important.
I can invite you into my home.

241
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:18,898
I just wanted to see
how you're holding up.

242
00:15:19,631 --> 00:15:20,633
Thank you.

243
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:23,069
It's not blowing over like we...
like we hoped it would.

244
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:25,305
You saw the article.
Did you see it?

245
00:15:25,473 --> 00:15:28,141
- We need to set the record straight.
- You should make a statement.

246
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:30,743
- The sooner, the better.
- I agree. I think I should.

247
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:32,852
I'd like to get the facts out there.

248
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:34,601
Good. Good.
Actually...

249
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,746
it's part of the reason I came over.
We spent some time last night,

250
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,887
a little overtime, actually,
drawing up something for you,

251
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,108
and we'd like you to think about it,
if you would.

252
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,291
We've lined up
a reporter who's friendly.

253
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,094
- Paul, this is an apology.
- We have a friendly reporter...

254
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:49,662
"Inappropriate conduct"?

255
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,365
- But that is inaccurate.
- The paper's gonna bury it.

256
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:55,067
The Panthers will be in the playoffs,
and everyone's gonna be happy.

257
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:57,604
- You're being bullied.
- And you'll get to keep your job.

258
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,724
I do live 50 miles away.

259
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,578
The reason I drove here is because
you're very good at what you do.

260
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:07,181
I don't want to lose you.

261
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,518
I don't want to lose y job either.

262
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:14,521
I hope you take this
very seriously, okay?

263
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:16,678
I know you'll make
the right decision.

264
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:18,651
Give my best to Eric.

265
00:16:35,576 --> 00:16:37,284
This magazine sucks.

266
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:48,224
I'm the dad, right?

267
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,153
- Yes, you are.
- And it's my baby.

268
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:53,459
It's trying to, you know, to...

269
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:55,327
- Claw.
- To claw his way out,

270
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:57,715
- or her way or whoever, but...
- Its way out.

271
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,865
Its way out.

272
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:03,803
- Are you ready to be an uncle?
- I've been waiting 38 hours for this.

273
00:17:03,971 --> 00:17:04,804
All right.

274
00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:07,206
I'm going back in.

275
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:08,956
- Get in there.
- I'm going.

276
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:10,410
- Sir?
- I'm going in there.

277
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:13,212
- Sir?
- You can't stop me! I'm going back in!

278
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:14,545
I'm the dad.

279
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:16,812
I'm the dad.

280
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,466
- We got this under control.
- Get out!

281
00:17:26,591 --> 00:17:27,627
I am the dad!

282
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:29,629
All right. It's all right.
Go.

283
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:32,432
Help her breathe.
Help her breathe.

284
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,800
Keep her focused and...

285
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,168
Just breathe.

286
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:37,994
You know what you're doing.
Just breathe, just breathe...

287
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:50,916
- Do you want a ride?
- No.

288
00:17:55,114 --> 00:17:56,522
I want you to do me a favor.

289
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,094
I want you to be easy
on your mother this week.

290
00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:01,430
I want you to be easy
on your mother this week.

291
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:03,863
It's gonna be a long one.
You do this for me,

292
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:05,341
and what I'll do for you

293
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:08,034
is we can talk about
this house-building or whatever. Deal?

294
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,653
Deal.

295
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:16,460
- What are you gonna do about the car?
- I'm gonna clean it. You go to school.

296
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,128
- Go to school.
- Want some help?

297
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:20,680
Nope. You go to school.

298
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:25,017
<i>Sammy, that field they play on
don't have near enough seats,</i>

299
00:18:25,142 --> 00:18:27,541
<i>and the neighborhood...
I'm gonna tell you the truth.</i>

300
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,957
<i>I don't feel safe
taking my family over there.</i>

301
00:18:30,082 --> 00:18:32,124
<i>Things are just different
on that side of town.</i>

302
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,561
<i>Na, na, caller hold on.*
There's a lot of good folks</i>

303
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:37,900
- <i>over in east Dillon.</i>
- <i>I'm not saying that ain't true,</i>

304
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:40,836
<i>but I was told
they have gang members on that...</i>

305
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:54,197
- Why you stopping?
- Get out there!

306
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,382
- Let's go! Come on, guys.
- Coach.

307
00:18:58,393 --> 00:18:59,993
What the hell is this?

308
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:07,976
It's just toothpicks.

309
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:13,003
- Get it cleaned up.
- Let's spread out.

310
00:19:13,128 --> 00:19:15,768
Let's get them out of there one by one.
Take them out.

311
00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:17,014
Let's go!

312
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:19,603
We can't start practicing
till we get the field cleaned up!

313
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:21,407
- Get it out.
- You all right?

314
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:24,543
Anybody got a toothpick?

315
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:30,249
I understand
it took west Dillon two hours...

316
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:34,420
Two hours for west Dillon to pick
all those toothpicks out of that field.

317
00:19:34,588 --> 00:19:38,090
Anybody want to share who the genius was
that came up with this master plan?

318
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:40,315
I didn't do it.

319
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:46,550
You look a bit tired there.
How you feeling?

320
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:48,886
Feel great, coach.
Ready for practice.

321
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:49,838
Good.

322
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,307
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna have some fun.

323
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,236
What we're gonna do is,
we're gonna let Lance kick a 40-yarder.

324
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:58,611
And if he makes that,

325
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:01,628
we're gonna begin our practice,
but until he does...

326
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,616
we'll run jingle jangles.

327
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:08,787
Let's go, right now.
Stand up. Let's go.

328
00:20:17,644 --> 00:20:18,797
Let's go, 2-1.

329
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:30,155
It is a beautiful day!

330
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:35,414
This wasn't on school grounds.
She's not my student,

331
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:38,000
and I followed
district protocol all the way.

332
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,752
I'm not saying
you don't have a case.

333
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,954
- Good.
- If you're telling me the whole story,

334
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:44,543
you've got one hell
of a wrongful-termination suit.

335
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:48,037
They're trying to tell me
I've got to make a big public apology.

336
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:49,766
You don't need to make an apology.

337
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:50,891
I don't?

338
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:55,667
But if you don't and they take your job,
I'll file that in court,

339
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:58,615
- and I got a pretty good idea we'd win.
- Okay, good.

340
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,871
But I want you to know something, Tami.
Cases like this can drag out.

341
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,468
They can take a long time.

342
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:05,956
Well, what do you mean?

343
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:09,314
I mean, when you say "long time",
is that months or...?

344
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:10,783
It could take years.

345
00:21:12,127 --> 00:21:15,053
And it's possible we could get you
reinstated at the end of it all,

346
00:21:15,293 --> 00:21:16,643
but I doubt that.

347
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:19,391
And then while
the case is pending, you're...

348
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:23,128
You're gonna have a hard time getting
work as principal when this is going on.

349
00:21:24,194 --> 00:21:25,916
My record is exemplary.

350
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:29,184
I understand that, Tami,
but there's law,

351
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:31,336
and then there's life.

352
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:43,715
Uncle Tim.

353
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:54,348
- You make it true or what?
- See for yourself.

354
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:08,379
It's a boy.

355
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:26,101
Come on over, man.

356
00:22:29,008 --> 00:22:31,632
This is Steven Hannibal Riggins.

357
00:22:53,794 --> 00:22:54,624
What?

358
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:56,924
Come on, y'all.

359
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,536
Come on, now.
Come on, now, y'all.

360
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:05,797
Come on, now!

361
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:26,751
I mean, this has gotten out of hand.

362
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,021
- They ought to find other things to do.
- You think so.

363
00:23:32,432 --> 00:23:33,758
Where's the meat?

364
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:35,345
I don't cook flesh, Dad.

365
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:38,022
Your daughter made dinner,
'cause she knew we needed the help.

366
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:39,760
- Thank you so much.
- You're busy,

367
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,409
so I thought I'd help out.

368
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:45,353
Thank you. I appreciate it.

369
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:47,973
Hey, thank you.

370
00:23:48,956 --> 00:23:50,642
- You're welcome.
- That toothpick thing

371
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,959
had everybody in an uproar today.

372
00:23:53,312 --> 00:23:54,546
Kids will be kids.

373
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:57,500
What'd the lawyer have to say today?

374
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:00,518
He had a lot to say.

375
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:02,719
Well, I wasn't there.
What did he say?

376
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:07,025
I don't know.
Do we have to talk about it at dinner?

377
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:09,494
I'm just asking.
Did he say anything about the statement?

378
00:24:10,052 --> 00:24:12,530
- I need to talk to somebody else.
- All right.

379
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:23,708
- Do you want me to get that?
- I'll get it.

380
00:24:23,972 --> 00:24:25,322
Thank you, honey.

381
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:31,748
- <i>Lions suck!</i>
- You know what? Go to hell.

382
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:34,603
Youall want any of this?

383
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:37,522
- You still have some.
- This brisket for your mom.

384
00:24:37,905 --> 00:24:40,255
- Hey, there.
- I made this for you.

385
00:24:40,535 --> 00:24:41,535
Here.

386
00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:43,621
You're giving me your iPod?

387
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:46,598
Well, no, it's a loaner,
but I made you a playlist.

388
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,901
You made me a playlist, Jess?

389
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:53,061
Yeah, I made you a playlist.
It's for you to practice.

390
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:55,273
Kind of like a slow jams mix?

391
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:01,606
- How you doing on that grill?
- Everything's going good, ma'am.

392
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:02,981
All right, now.

393
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:05,096
How's it going, son?

394
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:06,221
What's up?

395
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:07,519
I found him.

396
00:25:09,232 --> 00:25:11,589
- Where at?
- His punk ass laying low

397
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:14,084
about two and a half hours
away from here in Bubbat county,

398
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:16,678
- hiding like a little bitch.
- You sure it's him?

399
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:18,321
Man, for sure.

400
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,890
Tomorrow night...

401
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:22,407
You in?

402
00:25:24,184 --> 00:25:25,584
You know I'm down.

403
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:31,708
It says "Landry."
Yeah, you got it...

404
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,583
Right there.
Press play.

405
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,599
This is...

406
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:41,125
This is all just crowd noise,
though, Jess.

407
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,954
It's a football thing.
You know...?

408
00:25:43,122 --> 00:25:45,323
So I listen... I listen to this
while I'm kicking.

409
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:47,433
While you're kicking,
while you're practicing.

410
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:49,808
Just use it.
Practice to it, okay?

411
00:25:50,096 --> 00:25:51,838
- All right.
- Well, thank you.

412
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:58,656
One of these days, fellas.

413
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,072
I'm jealous.
I'm so jealous.

414
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,840
That's what I thought.

415
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,716
Let me talk to you for a second.

416
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,050
You're a good dude.

417
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:15,303
And Jess...

418
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:17,151
She deserves the best.

419
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,909
I'm glad you two are together.

420
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:22,764
Make her happy.

421
00:27:08,218 --> 00:27:09,700
It's pretty wild, huh?

422
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:16,573
How do you get away
with just sleeping like this?

423
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:19,351
I think he's winking at me.

424
00:27:24,191 --> 00:27:25,183
All right.

425
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:27,925
- You want to ride into work together?
- You're good.

426
00:27:28,093 --> 00:27:30,261
- Be a dad for a day.
- You serious?

427
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:32,863
- We got two cars coming in.
- Yeah, I can take care of two cars.

428
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:34,065
Can you?

429
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:37,034
Be a dad for a day.
Hell, be a dad for a week.

430
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:38,541
Thanks, man.

431
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:41,135
All right, little man,
keep your guard up.

432
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:42,757
Stay angry.

433
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:46,554
I'll see you.

434
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:47,779
Thanks, man.

435
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:52,283
You did good.

436
00:27:54,587 --> 00:27:55,687
Thanks, man.

437
00:27:58,611 --> 00:27:59,761
I'll see you.

438
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:03,941
You're not angry,
are you, stevie, hmm?

439
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:10,802
You love your daddy, don't you, hmm?

440
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:14,323
You love your daddy?

441
00:28:15,002 --> 00:28:16,140
Your daddy loves you.

442
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:30,254
Yeah, I will put men on this.
Don't you worry about that.

443
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:32,529
As many men as I can spare.

444
00:28:32,672 --> 00:28:34,919
Panthers did this, Michael.

445
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:37,786
I don't know if I'd jump
on that right away, Buddy.

446
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:40,066
But you know me,
I'm gonna follow up on it.

447
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:44,681
- What do you want to do about the team?
- Get them over to Carroll park.

448
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,238
- I'll meet you over there when I can.
- Yes, sir.

449
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,774
Why this nonsense
have to come to my school?

450
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:55,139
Trouble always seems
to be drawn to you, Levi. I don't know.

451
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:58,071
Yeah, ever since you came.
I guess you about right.

452
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:12,530
Did you hear
what happened over here?

453
00:29:12,698 --> 00:29:14,829
Yeah. I'm sitting here
with Wade Aikmen, actually.

454
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,806
<i>And we're gonna put you on speaker.</i>

455
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:21,646
I talked to principal Burnwell twice.
And we just wanted to call you

456
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:23,181
<i>to talk this whole thing over.</i>

457
00:29:23,306 --> 00:29:24,937
<i>Eric, I just wanted to assure you</i>

458
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:27,590
that if any of our players
had anything to do with this,

459
00:29:27,715 --> 00:29:29,750
I'll suspend them
from the team if I have to.

460
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:30,848
They won't play.

461
00:29:32,155 --> 00:29:33,817
So how bad is the damage over there?

462
00:29:33,985 --> 00:29:36,050
Do we need to call
the conference director?

463
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:38,734
<i>Well, I just got off
the phone with him, Wade.</i>

464
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:41,854
- And what are you guys thinking?
- You know what I'm thinking?

465
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:43,703
Maybe you give me
a call back in an hour.

466
00:29:43,828 --> 00:29:45,663
I'd like to talk to my wife.

467
00:29:45,831 --> 00:29:47,498
I'll call you in about an hour.

468
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,197
Thanks, Wade.

469
00:29:49,437 --> 00:29:51,302
- I'll see what I can't find out.
- All right.

470
00:29:51,427 --> 00:29:53,170
You mind closing that door?

471
00:29:56,606 --> 00:29:58,465
Hey, babe.
How you holding up?

472
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:01,378
<i>I am not playing
on a fair field here.</i>

473
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:04,281
I know.
That makes two of us, hon.

474
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,432
<i>You gonna be all right?</i>

475
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:14,291
All right, I'll see you at home.

476
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:15,551
All right.

477
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,818
Do you love it?

478
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,175
That's an understatement.

479
00:30:46,552 --> 00:30:47,552
Oh, man.

480
00:30:49,076 --> 00:30:51,528
Never thought I'd say this,
but I do feel like

481
00:30:52,507 --> 00:30:54,357
I figured it out, you know?

482
00:30:55,213 --> 00:30:56,463
Figured out...?

483
00:30:57,234 --> 00:30:58,148
Life!

484
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,101
- Life!
- What it's all about, you know?

485
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:01,226
This.

486
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:04,107
You know, owning this land,
and Billy,

487
00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:06,398
and just his son, and...

488
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:10,147
The shop doing as well as it is,
and...

489
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:12,741
You know, I don't...

490
00:31:13,116 --> 00:31:14,366
It's just so...

491
00:31:16,023 --> 00:31:17,023
I'm happy.

492
00:31:18,202 --> 00:31:19,890
And I can honestly say that.

493
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,918
It's so great.

494
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:38,308
Tim, I love you.

495
00:31:49,113 --> 00:31:50,463
We can't do this.

496
00:31:52,218 --> 00:31:53,218
I'm sorry.

497
00:32:09,488 --> 00:32:10,488
I'll be...

498
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,111
- Why are you here right now?
- What you say that to Landry for, huh?

499
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,738
Yo, Vince, come on!

500
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:18,601
A second!
I'll be coming right down!

501
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:20,617
I'm coming!
I ain't got time for this.

502
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:23,141
- I don't got time for it right now.
- Hell, no.

503
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:25,671
- You think I'm stupid?
- Stupid about what?

504
00:32:25,796 --> 00:32:28,024
You think I don't know
what you're up to right now?

505
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:29,811
Hell, no.

506
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:35,046
I got something to do.

507
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:37,236
Why are you here?

508
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:39,527
- You don't!
- I know that good guy that's inside.

509
00:32:39,652 --> 00:32:42,172
You got your good guy.
You got your good guy!

510
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,766
- Landry's so good for me, right?
- Woman, get out of my way.

511
00:32:44,891 --> 00:32:47,369
He's such a good guy, right?
And you're horrible, right?

512
00:32:47,494 --> 00:32:50,847
That's exactly what I am!
I am a monster! That's what I am!

513
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,389
I'm that guy!

514
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:57,854
Vince, come back.

515
00:33:51,383 --> 00:33:52,676
You Tim Riggins?

516
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:55,415
33...
You're the football star, huh?

517
00:33:56,645 --> 00:33:57,695
Used to be.

518
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:00,844
What you been doing in here?

519
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:03,988
Just fixing cars, sir.

520
00:34:04,657 --> 00:34:06,549
Need to ask you a few questions...

521
00:34:07,304 --> 00:34:08,625
About some missing cars.

522
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:16,026
Say, youngster,
you ever fired off one of these?

523
00:34:16,381 --> 00:34:17,567
- No.
- Short barrel.

524
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,498
Your pops used to carry that gun
or one just like it.

525
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,595
Your pops... Thug.

526
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,142
You cross him, you best believe
you was gonna get got.

527
00:34:26,736 --> 00:34:28,602
He say you ain't got no thug in you.

528
00:34:28,896 --> 00:34:29,979
What you say?

529
00:34:30,454 --> 00:34:31,881
I say I'm in the car, ain't I?

530
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,176
Go on, take you a drink, then.
Steel up them nerves.

531
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:38,947
Go.

532
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:45,258
When we get there, we're gonna park
about a block away from the house.

533
00:34:45,618 --> 00:34:49,622
It's a trap house. There's only 2 doors.
One in the front and one in the back.

534
00:34:50,028 --> 00:34:51,801
I'm gonna walk up
with this sawed-off,

535
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:53,573
blow holes through the front door.

536
00:34:53,698 --> 00:34:56,374
Hell, by then he either down,
or he running towards the back door.

537
00:34:56,499 --> 00:34:58,365
And that's where you waiting
for his ass.

538
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:02,567
That's payback, son.

539
00:35:03,662 --> 00:35:05,949
He ain't stupid enough
to keep the bag on him at the house,

540
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:07,850
so I ain't saying
we coming up with money.

541
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:10,216
What I am saying is
what I find or what you come up on,

542
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,979
we split up the middle, 50/50.
You all right with that?

543
00:35:14,627 --> 00:35:15,727
That's good?

544
00:35:16,994 --> 00:35:18,628
What the hell wrong with you?

545
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,995
Where the hell you going?
Get your ass back in this car.

546
00:35:22,908 --> 00:35:24,308
What you gonna do?

547
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:28,306
Man, you acting like a little bitch.
You better get your ass back.

548
00:35:31,642 --> 00:35:34,477
No, this is one deal
you can't renege on, son.

549
00:35:34,694 --> 00:35:37,252
Ain't no backing out!
Backing out ain't a option!

550
00:35:37,556 --> 00:35:39,272
What you gonna do, son?

551
00:35:44,407 --> 00:35:46,307
If I get back in that car...

552
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,693
My mama's not supposed to bury me.

553
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,768
I'm supposed to bury my mama!

554
00:35:54,965 --> 00:35:57,319
Looks like to me somebody
gonna be burying the both of you,

555
00:35:57,444 --> 00:36:00,483
'cause you gonna die
you don't get your ass back in...

556
00:36:01,338 --> 00:36:02,228
Now.

557
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:07,193
Do what you got to do, then.

558
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,814
Go ahead, man,
do what you got to do, yo.

559
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,649
Your old man was right about you.

560
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:19,540
You ain't nothing
but a soft-ass little boy.

561
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:22,330
You think it's over, youngster?

562
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:24,797
No, it's far from over, Junior.

563
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,170
I got you.

564
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,830
I got you, you little bitch!

565
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:56,308
So this is all to say

566
00:36:56,711 --> 00:36:58,127
we're still working on it.

567
00:36:58,295 --> 00:37:00,554
Those were big tires
did that damage.

568
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,798
We don't know every truck
in town that size...

569
00:37:02,966 --> 00:37:03,798
Yet,

570
00:37:03,923 --> 00:37:05,788
but we're gonna check them all out.

571
00:37:06,364 --> 00:37:08,924
- We'll find them.
- Sheriff, if... If I may.

572
00:37:10,516 --> 00:37:12,499
Every parent on our team
was contacted.

573
00:37:13,588 --> 00:37:15,810
Every single player
was accounted for.

574
00:37:16,346 --> 00:37:18,196
This was not a retaliation.

575
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:19,969
Retaliation?

576
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,036
For the toothpicks.

577
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:24,920
Toothpicks?

578
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:26,622
Yeah, that's a prank.

579
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,769
- Really?
- Did you see what you did to our field?

580
00:37:28,894 --> 00:37:31,627
Do you have any idea
how many man-hours it took?

581
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,860
Coaches! Coaches!

582
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:44,977
Please!

583
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,067
Look, I know
we got a lot of hard feelings here.

584
00:37:48,948 --> 00:37:51,213
But look, the thing
we got to remember here

585
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:54,321
is that in the end,
this is just a football game.

586
00:37:56,853 --> 00:37:58,553
Hey, Will, you know what?

587
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:01,071
My family's been getting
threatening phone calls

588
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,956
all week long,
all times of the night.

589
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:05,582
My home has been vandalized,
and my field has been destroyed,

590
00:38:05,707 --> 00:38:09,096
so don't patronize us and tell us
it's just a damn football game.

591
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:12,309
I'm sorry.

592
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:17,056
I know the longer this goes on,
the worse this is just gonna get

593
00:38:17,181 --> 00:38:19,431
so I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

594
00:38:19,977 --> 00:38:22,310
I spent the last 24 hours
on the phone

595
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:25,813
talking to every school
from Kingdom come to Timbuktu.

596
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,833
With the short notice
and Thanksgiving coming up,

597
00:38:29,186 --> 00:38:30,686
we couldn't find a neutral site.

598
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:33,689
But...

599
00:38:34,925 --> 00:38:37,694
There is a proposal
from west Dillon.

600
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:42,932
You have got to be kidding.
This is our home football game!

601
00:39:33,035 --> 00:39:34,285
I didn't do it.

602
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:15,211
I'm sorry, man.

603
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,770
I'm sorry.

604
00:41:40,614 --> 00:41:42,444
Game's gonna be at Herrmann field.

605
00:41:44,508 --> 00:41:45,808
I'm sorry, babe.

606
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:49,551
I heard they were talking
about doing that.

607
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:12,823
I'm sorry.

608
00:42:14,578 --> 00:42:15,410
It's okay.

609
00:42:20,311 --> 00:42:22,124
I'm gonna make a statement.

610
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:24,680
What statement are you gonna make?

611
00:42:27,623 --> 00:42:28,823
You guys okay?

612
00:42:30,387 --> 00:42:32,160
Yeah, hon.
It's all right.
