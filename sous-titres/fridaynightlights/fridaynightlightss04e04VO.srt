1
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,177
- Hey, you got a boyfriend?
- No. Why?

2
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:34,182
- 'cause that's the guy
that should be doing all this,

3
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,687
Giving you rides everywhere.

4
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:37,959
- Maybe it'd be more efficient
if you were my boyfriend.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,166
- Got luke here, a new player.

6
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:41,170
Y'all make sure
that he is welcome.

7
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,343
- You're a long way
from home, boy.

8
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,647
- I guess so.

9
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:45,351
- I'm julie,
matt's girlfriend.

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,090
- So you're the ball and chain
that keeps dragging him down.

11
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,530
- Do you think
I'm holding you back?

12
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,437
- No, you're the most important
thing in my life.

13
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:53,610
- If you can't finish games,
I can't keep this program going.

14
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:56,217
You turn it around,
or we gonna shut it down.

15
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:57,391
[cheering]

16
00:00:57,428 --> 00:00:59,662
- Vince howard
puts the lions on the board

17
00:00:59,702 --> 00:01:01,235
For their first touchdown.

18
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:03,575
[cheering]

19
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:10,063
- It's still
a sad state of affairs

20
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:11,502
For the panthers.

21
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:12,572
In a single week,

22
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,877
The team got a forfeit
on the books,

23
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:16,682
And a great player,
luke cafferty,

24
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,023
Shipped out of school.

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,227
Callers, you say what?

26
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:20,832
- Sammy, I got to correct you
on something.

27
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:22,770
That cafferty kid
wasn't shipped out.

28
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:24,876
He was hand-delivered
by principal taylor

29
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,751
To east dillon,
her husband's team,

30
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:28,958
And everybody knows it.

31
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:32,665
- [sighs]

32
00:01:32,707 --> 00:01:33,941
- Taylor.

33
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:36,913
- Good morning, levi.

34
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:40,123
- I see you finished
the game last night,

35
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:41,665
Way to go.

36
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:44,271
Sis boom bah.
Rah, rah, rah.

37
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:46,946
- Hey, levi.
- Huh?

38
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:50,155
- Pep rallies...

39
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:51,597
They build excitement.

40
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:54,503
They're good for the school,
good for the team.

41
00:01:54,543 --> 00:01:57,312
- Pep rallies
don't cost, correct?

42
00:01:57,353 --> 00:01:59,688
- Nope.

43
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:02,763
- Good.
Don't let me get in your way.

44
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:07,513
- Come on, how much
retyping you got to do?

45
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:11,088
Just put your test scores in,
tell them how awesome you are,

46
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,631
And we can move along.

47
00:02:12,668 --> 00:02:13,835
- It's too long.

48
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:15,440
I have to cut it down
at least by half.

49
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:17,546
Did you hear that brown
used to make you

50
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:19,785
Handwrite your essays?
- Wow.

51
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:22,693
Well, that's so that they could
weed out the serial killers.

52
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:25,436
- [chuckles]

53
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:28,045
- So what's the, uh--what's
the final list of schools?

54
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:29,985
- Um...

55
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,160
U.C. Berkeley,
u.C.S.B.,

56
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:35,870
Brown, amherst,

57
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,246
Um, mount holyoke,

58
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:41,955
N.Y.U.,

59
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,164
U.T. Austin--

60
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:45,837
Hook 'em horns.

61
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,543
[chuckles]

62
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:54,999
- Good splits, good splits!

63
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:56,772
Come off the ball, now.
Come off the ball.

64
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,811
- Step up.
Come on up.

65
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,218
- Fumble!
- Oh, man.

66
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:02,557
- Come on, now, 5.

67
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:04,362
- Get it together out there.
- What are you doing?

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,601
- Do you know how to read
the "d," man.?

69
00:03:05,638 --> 00:03:06,705
Read the end, dude.

70
00:03:06,742 --> 00:03:07,942
- That defensive end
didn't move.

71
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,279
- He did move.
You're supposed to take him.

72
00:03:09,316 --> 00:03:11,050
- Next time, give me the ball
and get out my way.

73
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,389
- Come here, come here.
Shut up.

74
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:15,195
Shut your mouth.
Come here.

75
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:17,570
You read the end.
You stay in the pitch lane.

76
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,711
You keep your personal crap
off this field,

77
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,450
And you quit
letting me down

78
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:22,956
And quit letting
the team down,

79
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:25,128
'cause we are all
getting tired of it.

80
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,601
Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

81
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:29,073
- Yes, sir.

82
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:32,349
- Let's go, now.
Come on.

83
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,958
- All right, huddle up.

84
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:35,363
Let's go.
Get in the huddle.

85
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,102
Good jab step, three-two.
Good jab step.

86
00:03:38,142 --> 00:03:39,843
Good fake in there.
Now let's go.

87
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:41,182
Right there.

88
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:42,853
[overlapping shouting]

89
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,159
- Come on, now.
That's on you.

90
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,403
- What the hell?
You trying to be funny?

91
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:50,143
I didn't even have time
to make a move out there.

92
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,681
- I don't understand.
Why aren't you in the end zone?

93
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,754
I got out of your way.
- I will break you up, boy.

94
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:55,092
Next time
you give me the ball,

95
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,330
You make sure you mean
to give it to me.

96
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:58,068
[overlapping shouting]

97
00:03:58,106 --> 00:03:59,440
You, you,
you're my problem.

98
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:01,178
- You're your problem
right now.

99
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:03,217
- No, you're my problem.
- That's enough.

100
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,633
- Yeah.

101
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,904
Deer and beer, here we come,
two days away.

102
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,040
Let's get after it, billy.

103
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:03,278
- Tim, what the hell
are you doing?

104
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:04,816
This is how accidents happen.

105
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:06,287
- Minds, I don't think
they're loaded. We're fine.

106
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:08,125
- Tim, just put them
in the corner or something.

107
00:05:08,163 --> 00:05:10,064
All right, she's not supposed
to have any stress right now.

108
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:11,504
- Where's the gun cleaner?

109
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,944
- Why do you have
to clean your guns?

110
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:17,153
- Wait.

111
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,167
You didn't tell her, did you?

112
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:22,239
- I totally see now.

113
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:23,410
So y'all just get to go hunting

114
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:25,147
And get drunk
and leave me here by myself.

115
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:26,552
- No.
No, no, no, no, no.

116
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:27,690
- I have an ultrasound
this week.

117
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:28,860
- I understand that.

118
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:30,631
And I want to be there
for that ultrasound.

119
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:32,236
- So I just get to shove this
fat ass behind a steering wheel

120
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,976
And drive myself to the doctor,
is that what's gonna happen?

121
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:36,214
- Baby, I will be there
for that ultrasound, okay?

122
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,754
Timmy and I
can go hunting anytime.

123
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:39,126
- No, we can't.

124
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:40,564
That's why it's called
hunting season, billy.

125
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:42,936
- Seriously, I'm gonna put
your head through a wall.

126
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,343
Would you shut up?

127
00:05:47,657 --> 00:05:49,425
[whistle blows]
- let's go.

128
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:55,100

130
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:03,269
Go!
Let's go!

131
00:06:03,307 --> 00:06:04,307
Go!

132
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:06,445
[players shout]

133
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:25,875
- All right, jokers.

134
00:06:25,913 --> 00:06:29,182
Who took my wallet?

135
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,658
Seriously, it's not funny.

136
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:35,668
- You know what I do
when I lose something?

137
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:38,013
I retrace my steps.

138
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:40,353
Maybe that's what
you should do, retrace them.

139
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:41,693
- I didn't lose it.

140
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,364
It was in my locker,
and now it's missing.

141
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,468
- I mean, you want us
to get together?

142
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:45,506
We could help you
look for it if you want.

143
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:46,642
- All right, cut the crap.

144
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,947
Seriously, I'm not gonna
tell you again.

145
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:49,551
Give me my wallet back.

146
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:52,457
- You're so sure I took it.

147
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:54,766
- Mm-hmm.

148
00:06:56,845 --> 00:06:58,846
- Go and get it, then.

149
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:04,531
- Oh, oh.

150
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,205
[overlapping shouting]

151
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:08,646
- All right, all right,
all right.

152
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:11,118
- I got a pep rally
to organize this week.

153
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:13,726
I have got papers to grade.
I've got a family to raise.

154
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,199
I've got a wife to love,

155
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:17,239
And then I've got
you two bozos,

156
00:07:17,277 --> 00:07:19,145
Trying to teach
you two something

157
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:21,751
You seem just damned determined
not to learn.

158
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,466
What makes you think
he took your wallet?

159
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:26,970
- It's obvious, coach.
- It obvious?

160
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:28,643
You're gonna make a hell
of a lawyer, aren't you?

161
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,348
Do you know where
his wallet is?

162
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:31,419
- No, sir.

163
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:32,823
- You don't know
where his wallet is?

164
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:34,362
- This is a bunch
of bull, coach.

165
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,433
- Hey, coach crowley!

166
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:38,073
- Yes, sir?

167
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:40,011
- Coach, would you take
these two gentlemen

168
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,283
To the gymnasium?

169
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:43,055
Have them run those stairs
for the next 30 minutes

170
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:44,861
Or until a wallet shows up,

171
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,333
Whichever one might come first.

172
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,071
- You bet.
- Thank you, coach.

173
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:49,943
Y'all enjoy.
- Let's go, boys.

174
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:56,832
- [scoffs]

- 7.

177
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:06,998
- Riggs, what's up?

178
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:09,805
- Slinging dough instead
of 60-yard bombs now, huh?

179
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:11,546
No chicago?

180
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:13,352
- Nah, I kind of felt
like I should stay here,

181
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,457
Take care of my grandma.

182
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,061
- Right.

183
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:17,399
- San antonio?

184
00:08:17,437 --> 00:08:19,171
- Negative.

185
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,877
- What else is new?

186
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:22,749
- You playing any ball?

187
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:24,221
- No, not really.

188
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,193
I've been working with this
artist on some art stuff.

189
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:27,665
Yeah, and then working here,
you know?

190
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:29,604
- Right.
I forgot about that.

191
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,477
- You, uh, gonna be watching
any football this weekend?

192
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:34,884
- No, I'm going hunting
this weekend, my friend.

193
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:36,593
- Oh, yeah?
- Get me some whitetail.

194
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:38,032
Maybe wrestle down some boars.

195
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:40,804
- Nice.

196
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:43,547
- That's my weekend.
- All right.

197
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:45,021
- Anyways,
it's good to see you.

198
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,826
- You too, buddy.
- Let's go for a beer sometime.

199
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:51,468
- Yeah, sure.

200
00:08:51,512 --> 00:08:54,581
Hey, riggins, actually, um...

201
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:58,192
Is it cool if maybe I go
hunting with you this weekend?

202
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:00,435
- You hunt?

203
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:02,643
- Well, I mean,
my--my dad took me

204
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:04,616
A couple times
when I was little.

205
00:09:04,655 --> 00:09:06,989
- Thursday morning...

206
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,829
5:15.
- All right.

207
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:11,236
- See you there.
- Yeah, man.

208
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:13,811
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

209
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,619
- It's nasty.
It's nothing but used goods.

210
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,594
Oh, landry, hey.

211
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:21,101
- Hey. What's going on?
You know devin.

212
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,041
- Hi. Hi.
- Hello.

213
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:24,648
- How you doing?

214
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:26,352
- You have a car.

215
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:27,558
He hit me with it.

216
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:29,496
- Yeah, I heard about that.

217
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:31,035
- Yeah, we all know
about it.

218
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:33,073
- I think you should use
that car

219
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:34,980
To drop me and my friends off
to this party

220
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:36,419
In kilroy tomorrow.

221
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:37,656
Yeah.

222
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:41,096
- That's an idea, huh?
- Yeah.

223
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:43,006
- Although I think
I might have to decline,

224
00:09:43,044 --> 00:09:45,446
'cause I've kind of been down
that road before,

225
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,186
Where a girl asked me
to do something,

226
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:48,858
And I just kind of said yes.

227
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:50,397
And all of a sudden,
everyone's calling me a word

228
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:51,835
That I don't like to use.

229
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:54,440
- You're invited to the party.
You are too.

230
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:56,816
- Well, you could've just
said that to begin with.

231
00:09:56,855 --> 00:09:58,489
- Thanks for the invitation.

232
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,828
- So you cool?
You want to come?

233
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,499
- Yeah, I think
that sounds great.

234
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:02,871
- It's gonna be a lot of fun.
- It's gonna be fun.

235
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:05,343
- All right, see you later.
- Okay, bye.

236
00:10:05,382 --> 00:10:06,749
- Okay.
- All right.

237
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:09,288
- So you're gonna go
to a party in kilroy.

238
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:11,263
- Yeah, I am.
What is that?

239
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:12,735
Why with that tone?

240
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:15,040
- But I have to tell you
that when I die,

241
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,047
I hope people will say
that she gave

242
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:18,554
More than she took.

243
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:20,926
That would be
true success to me.

244
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:25,539
Mom.
I'm in.

245
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:26,881
- Oh, my god!

246
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,719
I could not be any prouder
of you, becky.

247
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,528
You make it look so easy,
and it's not.

248
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:33,968
It is not easy at all.
It is such hard work.

249
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:35,174
- Thanks, mom.

250
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:36,612
- You know what?
You need a new gown.

251
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:37,883
- Yeah?
- Absolutely.

252
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,121
A portrait neckline.

253
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:42,529
I know, how about tomorrow
before my shift,

254
00:10:42,568 --> 00:10:44,669
We could go find
the perfect dress,

255
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:46,543
The perfect shoes,
and then get a bite to eat.

256
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:47,815
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

257
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:49,219
- Yeah, tomorrow's great.
- Okay.

258
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:52,759
I can't wait to watch those
other girls eat your dust.

259
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:54,035
- I got to ask you something,

260
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:57,540
And I need you
to not be weird about it.

261
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,417
- What's up?

262
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:04,633
- There's this place
right outside of dillon

263
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:07,107
Called steers,

264
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:09,148
And I was wondering
if you'd go there with me.

265
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:10,587
- Steers?

266
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,659
- It's--

267
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:14,031
It's gay.

268
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:17,671
I mean, it's a gay place.

269
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,954
- Are you hitting on me?

270
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:23,061
- No.

271
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:24,731
You're not my type.

272
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,106
- Oh, I'm not your type?

273
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:30,850
- Look, I just need somebody
to go there with me.

274
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,992
This is a new experience,
and it's kind of weird.

275
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:37,936
And it'd be nice
to have a friend go with me.

276
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:39,980
- I'll go.

277
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,888
See what your type is like.

278
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:44,328
[engine turning]

279
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:46,267
- Well, I think
where we need to focus

280
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:50,042
All our attention right now
is library, library, library.

281
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,353
It's been since 2005
since we've had any updates.

282
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:55,362
It'z where we should focus
our funds.

283
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:57,570
- Yeah, but, um, you know,
I'm--I'm really sorry.

284
00:11:57,609 --> 00:11:59,743
Our budget is already
tapped out.

285
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:01,049
Maybe we can do this
next year.

286
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:02,386
- But, no, I mean, you know,

287
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:03,857
We had actually pushed it
last year,

288
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:05,329
And we had talked about
that this--

289
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:07,201
This would be where
our focus was this year.

290
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,406
- Look, there are
a lot of people

291
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:09,710
Who are pretty angry
out there, tami.

292
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:13,216
I mean, you realize
that a substantial portion

293
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:15,326
Of the school's revenue
is generated by football,

294
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:17,600
Don't you?

295
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,440
- Oh, so you mean
people are angry

296
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:21,847
Because I told luke cafferty
that he had to go

297
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:24,321
To the correct school
for his district?

298
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:26,062
That's why we're not gonna get
our library?

299
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:27,566
That seems like
a shame to me.

300
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:28,938
- Look, after what you did
with luke,

301
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:30,109
We're gonna be lucky

302
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:31,746
To reach half
the normal amount this year.

303
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,186
I mean, you cost yourself
and the school

304
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:37,561
Any chance we might have had
to improve that library.

305
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:39,237
Now, I'm sorry, tami,
if you'll excuse me,

306
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:40,875
I do have another meeting.

307
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:49,470
- [gasps]

308
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:53,750
What?

309
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:07,162
- Hello, mr. Rc collins,
class of '79?

310
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:11,238
Mr. Collins, I would like
to talk to you about football.

311
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:12,581
I would like to talk to you

312
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,253
About east dillon
high school football

313
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,192
And coach eric taylor.

314
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,198
Hello?

315
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:21,845
- Try the next one.

316
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:23,983
- How's it going?
- Good.

317
00:13:24,022 --> 00:13:26,757
- What are you doing exactly?

318
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:30,100
- We're looking up alumni from
the east dillon lions of past

319
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,243
To try to get them
to join the pep rally.

320
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:34,149
- Yeah, your husband
had the inspired idea

321
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,523
To make the pep rally
a sort of a homecoming.

322
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:38,397
- That is inspired.

323
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:40,536
- The lions of east dillon
are not roaring.

324
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:42,777
- He's not home.
- Try the nine, three--

325
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:44,950
- Honey, honey, come here.

326
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:46,856
Come here.

327
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:49,130
- Hello, is this
mr. Eddie boare,

328
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,537
Class of '79?

329
00:13:50,574 --> 00:13:52,875
- Honey, you need food.
- Huh?

330
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,682
- You need food
for these people.

331
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,089
If you want to bring people in,
you got to make them some food,

332
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,796
Just like we do,
just like we've always done.

333
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:02,672
- You offering to cook dinner?

334
00:14:02,712 --> 00:14:06,014
- Oh, lordy.
Well, perhaps I am.

335
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:08,458
Perhaps I am offering
to cook dinner, babe, yeah.

336
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:11,166
Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

337
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:14,242
- Mm-hmm.

338
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:15,583
You're welcome.

339
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,523
- That's real sweet.

340
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:20,831
- Thanks.
- Okay.

341
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:23,306
All right, well, I'm gonna
get myself ready for school.

342
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:25,146
Y'all, good luck.
- Hi.

343
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:26,885
- I'm stan traub,

344
00:14:26,924 --> 00:14:28,691
Assistant coach.

345
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:30,197
- Julie, daughter.

346
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:31,734
[chuckles]
nice to meet you.

347
00:14:31,773 --> 00:14:33,607
- Hey, mom.

348
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:39,255
Mom, are you ready to go?

349
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:55,040
- What?

350
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,914
- Can I borrow your truck?

351
00:14:56,953 --> 00:14:58,353
- No.
- Please.

352
00:14:58,391 --> 00:15:00,492
- You can't borr--you don't even
have your license.

353
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:03,933
- I know how to drive.
- I don't care.

354
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:08,250
- Thanks.

355
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,435
- What's wrong?

356
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,048
- My mom blew me off...

357
00:15:18,088 --> 00:15:19,421
Again.

358
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:24,134
- There is a gay bar
in dillon?

359
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,675
- It's not in dillon.
It's outside of dillon.

360
00:15:26,715 --> 00:15:27,982
- It's the same difference.

361
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,654
- Mr. Matthew,
"za" is not a word.

362
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:32,229
- "za" is a word.

363
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,200
And if you look at it,
it spells "za,"

364
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:36,006
As in "pizza."

365
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:38,112
It's vernacular
in certain places, but wait--

366
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:39,352
- You are such a liar.

367
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:41,090
- Don't try and distract me
from the fact

368
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:42,429
That you're going
to a gay bar.

369
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:44,132
What are you gonna do
at--at a gay bar?

370
00:15:44,171 --> 00:15:47,506
- Dance and make out
with some chicks.

371
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:48,849
- I-I knew it.

372
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:50,687
I knew you wanted
to experiment.

373
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:53,327
- No, I'm going for devin
to be her moral support.

374
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:54,634
- Whatever,
I don't even care.

375
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:56,538
I'm going hunting
with riggins anyway.

376
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:57,644
- That's a joke.

377
00:15:57,681 --> 00:15:59,348
You're going hunting
with riggins?

378
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:00,887
- It's not a joke.

379
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:02,658
- So you're just gonna go shoot
some poor defenseless animals

380
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:03,697
For the hell of it?

381
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,101
- Uh...

382
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:07,275
Yeah, well, to eat.

383
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:08,345
- You are so much better
than that.

384
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:09,616
Why would you stoop
to that level?

385
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:11,286
- No, I'm not.
I'm not better than that.

386
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:12,525
- It's disgusting.
- Whoa, hold on.

387
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:14,429
Hold the phone.
I live in dillon.

388
00:16:14,468 --> 00:16:15,968
And people in dillon,
what they do

389
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:17,506
Is they go hunting
and shoot animals.

390
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:18,778
That's just
the way it works.

391
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:20,149
- That is an awful excuse,
first of all.

392
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:21,153
And second of all,
I live in dillon.

393
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,256
I don't go hunting.

394
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:24,694
- You don't live
in dillon for long.

395
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,802
I need a word...

396
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,408
Word.

397
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,814
- Is this about
my college applications?

398
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:35,395
- No, it's not about
your college applications.

399
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:36,835
It's not even about you.

400
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:39,475
I don't know why you think
everything's about you.

401
00:16:42,424 --> 00:16:44,492
- No.

402
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,300
No.

403
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:50,077
All of this says runner-up.

404
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:54,019
None of this is good.

405
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:56,195
- I'm sure your mom
wanted to be here for this.

406
00:16:56,235 --> 00:16:57,902
- Yeah, or she hooked up
with some dude.

407
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,074
You know, whatever.

408
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:00,311
- Hey, look, cut her some slack.
I'm sure--

409
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:01,915
- Don't.

410
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:03,754
[voice breaking]
okay, because every time

411
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:05,727
Something really important
comes along,

412
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:07,766
Every time, she does this.

413
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:10,607
She has an emergency
or a date,

414
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:12,549
Or she takes another shift
at that stupid bar.

415
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:14,254
- Hey, look,
this one's nice.

416
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:16,994
It's pretty.

417
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:18,969
- You think it's pretty?

418
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:21,542
- Yeah.

419
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,952
- Is that a portrait neckline?

420
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:26,428
- Yeah.

421
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:28,233
- This is stupid.
You don't even know.

422
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:29,671
Can we go, please?

423
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,543
- No, wait, we can't go.

424
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:34,350
We're here.
We got to pick something.

425
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,957
And what's that saying?

426
00:17:35,996 --> 00:17:38,864
Doesn't the dress find you?

427
00:17:38,905 --> 00:17:42,674
- Can we please just go?
This was such a dumb idea.

428
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,369
- [sighs]

429
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:52,243
I'm gonna tell you something,
all right?

430
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:55,250
And you can't tell it
to anyone else.

431
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:03,773
Well, my mother never took me
shopping for a pageant gown.

432
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:06,953
And because of that...

433
00:18:06,995 --> 00:18:09,029
I never placed at miss texas.

434
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:14,811
That's why
I got into football.

435
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:16,855
That's a fact.

436
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:22,571
This is what
we're gonna do.

437
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:25,881
We're gonna start
with the wheels,

438
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:28,457
And then we'll work
our way up.

439
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:30,665
By then,
hopefully they'll have

440
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:33,106
A new shipment
of dresses in.

441
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,312
âª âª

442
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,818
- Hey, landry.

443
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:38,992
Y'all, look at his shirt.

444
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:40,999
- Oh, my god.
What does he have on?

445
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,504
- How's it going?

446
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:44,944
You all ready for some
good old-fashioned revelry?

447
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:47,451
- What's this music?

448
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,726
- Oh, I'm glad you like it.
This is actually--

449
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:51,900
It's this local band.
Their name is crucifictorious.

450
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:53,472
- Do we have to listen
to this the whole ride?

451
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,478
I'm just saying.

452
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:56,650
- You look nice.

453
00:18:56,687 --> 00:18:58,321
- Oh, thanks.
What's this music?

454
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,760
- Here, hold on,
just give it a--

455
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:01,899
âª âª

456
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:03,371
- Feel his hair.

457
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,077
It's like grass.

458
00:19:05,114 --> 00:19:07,215
[laughter]

459
00:19:08,425 --> 00:19:09,959
[indistinct chatter]

460
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,187
- Jess, you are looking
really good tonight.

461
00:19:19,227 --> 00:19:22,195
I'm surprised
to see you here.

462
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:24,770
- Really?

463
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:27,513
- What's up with you?
What's your problem?

464
00:19:27,553 --> 00:19:30,121
- I ain't got
no problem with you.

465
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:32,563
I think I'm the only person
who sees how disposable

466
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:34,637
You treat girls.

467
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:36,510
- Well, I can only
treat a girl

468
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,450
How she allows me
to treat her.

469
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:41,358
Maybe I been talking
to the wrong girls.

470
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:43,365
- See, now you're trying
to piss me off.

471
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:46,306
- You're sitting here frontin'
like you don't--

472
00:19:46,346 --> 00:19:48,013
You don't think about me.

473
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:50,720
Not even a little bit?

474
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:56,903
- You wish I thought
about you.

475
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,916
I have a boyfriend.
- You got a boyfriend?

476
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:05,661
âª âª

477
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,109
- What's up with that, man?

478
00:20:07,146 --> 00:20:09,014
I know that ain't
that opie-looking dude

479
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:11,321
I hit in football practice,
is it?

480
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,794
- I guess so.

481
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:15,566
- Looks like jess
hitting it now.

482
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:24,529
- Ah.

483
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:26,770
It's over.

484
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,278
I'm not a panther anymore.

485
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:31,585
And it makes me--

486
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:34,126
I feel ill.

487
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,468
But I don't know why
I'm saying this to you.

488
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:38,274
You know what it's like
to be a panther

489
00:20:38,313 --> 00:20:41,548
And have it
taken away from you.

490
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,858
I'm sorry about it.

491
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,773
I'm sorry
about all of it, eric.

492
00:20:54,097 --> 00:20:55,964
- Tami and I are having

493
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:57,737
Some east dillon alumni over

494
00:20:57,775 --> 00:21:00,944
This week for dinner.

495
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:03,720
Why don't you
come over and join us?

496
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:11,709
- You can't fake
"boosterism," eric.

497
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:13,888
It comes from the heart.

498
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:18,135
That's the beauty of it.

499
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:24,190
- Hey, what's up, landry?

500
00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:25,960
I was surprised to see youat .

501
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:27,466
You have fun?
- That was fun.

502
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:28,638
That was a lot of fun.

503
00:21:28,674 --> 00:21:30,808
Someone spilled something
on my shoes,

504
00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:32,615
But other than that,
it was fun.

505
00:21:32,654 --> 00:21:34,087
- You had a good time.
You was dancing and stuff.

506
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,258
- Yeah, I had a good time.

507
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:36,796
- Yeah, you had
a good time with jess?

508
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,100
- Yeah.

509
00:21:38,138 --> 00:21:42,408
I mean, you know, just as...

510
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:43,852
I was just her ride.

511
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,092
- Really? 'cause she told me
you were her boyfriend.

512
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:49,435
- Is--no.

513
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,642
I'm definitely
not her boyfriend.

514
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:52,848
She said that?

515
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:54,620
- Yeah, she did.

516
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:57,125
- No.
That's crazy.

517
00:21:57,165 --> 00:22:00,635
- You're not lying to me,
are you?

518
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:03,012
- No, I'm not.

519
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,393
That's news to me.
[chuckles]

520
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:10,036
- All right.

521
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:11,707
You good.

522
00:22:11,745 --> 00:22:13,379
Be safe.

523
00:22:13,418 --> 00:22:15,218
- Okay.

524
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:18,697
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

525
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:21,603
- Uh...
- What'll it be?

526
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:23,878
- You're not by chance
virgil merriweather?

527
00:22:23,918 --> 00:22:26,986
1983 state championship,
quarterback,

528
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:28,462
East dillon lions?

529
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:30,400
- What'll it be?

530
00:22:30,438 --> 00:22:32,639
- Well, I'll have

531
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,947
A, uh, pound of brisket,
if you would, please.

532
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,186
I'm eric taylor.

533
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:37,791
I'm the new coach
over at east dillon.

534
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:40,097
- $8.50.

535
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:43,576
- You don't by chance
rent this place out

536
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:44,781
For events or anything,
do you?

537
00:22:44,818 --> 00:22:46,519
- Nope.

538
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:47,857
- Well, that's too bad.

539
00:22:47,895 --> 00:22:50,696
We got our first pep rally,
homecoming coming up.

540
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,505
- That's nice.

541
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:55,780
- Look, this may sound odd,
but my wife and I

542
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,087
Are having a dinner party
for some ex-lion players.

543
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,861
- Nope.

544
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:03,368
- I got some really great
kids on my team.

545
00:23:03,411 --> 00:23:04,578
They're good kids,

546
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:06,416
And they could sure
use someone like you

547
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:08,422
To come over and speak
some words to them.

548
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,028
- Brisket will be out
in a few.

549
00:23:16,954 --> 00:23:18,722
- Hey, luke,
let me get this straight, man.

550
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,227
This guy steals your wallet,

551
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,665
And you don't do anything
about it?

552
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:23,503
- What do you want me to do?
- Get your wallet back.

553
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,010
- Look, luke,

554
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:27,749
I know east dillon's
like a prison or whatever,

555
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,356
But I didn't think
you'd become someone's bitch.

556
00:23:29,394 --> 00:23:30,527
[laughter]

557
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:32,632
- Hey, I know, right?

558
00:23:34,678 --> 00:23:36,645
- Stop the car.

559
00:23:36,684 --> 00:23:38,017
- What?
- Stop the car.

560
00:23:42,904 --> 00:23:44,771
- I see you brought
your boyfriends with you

561
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,043
To help you look
for your wallet.

562
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:47,982
- Why don't you shut up
and give it back?

563
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,722
- You don't know
when to quit, do you?

564
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,497
- Oh!

565
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,410
- There you go, luke.
Take him down.

566
00:23:56,447 --> 00:23:58,248
- Don't know when to quit!

567
00:23:58,286 --> 00:23:59,487
[siren wails]

568
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:01,492
- Come on.
Let's go.

569
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,630
[siren wailing]

570
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:04,835
- Go, go.
- Come on, man, let's go.

571
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,042
- Forget him. Let's go.

572
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,824
- Break it up, boys.
Break it up.

573
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,725
- Hey, deacon,
how long have you

574
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:23,063
Been over there
at bethel baptist?

575
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,734
- 18 years.

576
00:24:24,772 --> 00:24:27,641
- That's a long time.

577
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:30,083
- Coach taylor,
can I ask you something?

578
00:24:30,122 --> 00:24:31,155
- Yes, sir.

579
00:24:31,193 --> 00:24:32,627
- Why are we here?

580
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:34,698
- Oh, lord have mercy, deacon.

581
00:24:34,738 --> 00:24:37,506
I'm trying to enjoy
my meal here.

582
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:39,781
Man.

583
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,156
- No, that's, uh--
that's a good question.

584
00:24:45,103 --> 00:24:46,904
Listen...

585
00:24:46,942 --> 00:24:49,377
I just started coaching
at this school.

586
00:24:49,418 --> 00:24:51,352
I would imagine that you
would think of it

587
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,857
As your high school too.

588
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:54,697
With that said,

589
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:58,805
We are facing--

590
00:24:58,848 --> 00:25:01,083
I am facing a lot
of challenges over there.

591
00:25:01,122 --> 00:25:02,889
And we've got some problems
that I want--

592
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:04,195
- With all due respect,

593
00:25:04,232 --> 00:25:05,966
People from your part of town

594
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,773
Pretty frequently tell us
about our problems,

595
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:10,614
Our crime problems,
our education problems.

596
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:12,754
You know how we got
these problems?

597
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:14,926
Back in the '80s, the west side
of dillon got developed.

598
00:25:14,966 --> 00:25:17,467
They got the mall.
They got the hotel.

599
00:25:17,508 --> 00:25:19,175
The west side of dillon
got the money.

600
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:20,981
- What did we get?
- We got forgotten.

601
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,520
- We got
our high school closed.

602
00:25:22,557 --> 00:25:24,391
- And so listen, we thank you
for your hospitality,

603
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:26,464
But I think I'm gonna
skip that lecture

604
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:29,205
About our problems.

605
00:25:29,245 --> 00:25:32,381
- Well, I know nobody
needs a lecture here,

606
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:33,689
That's for sure.

607
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:35,727
- That's right.
- I think the truth is,

608
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:37,733
We just--we just wanted
to get to know y'all

609
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:39,874
A little bit better,
and I was just hoping

610
00:25:39,912 --> 00:25:42,347
Y'all would get to know
my husband a little bit better,

611
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:43,721
Because if there's
one thing about this man,

612
00:25:43,758 --> 00:25:45,059
He loves football.

613
00:25:45,096 --> 00:25:47,097
He loves football.
He loves those boys out there.

614
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:48,269
Lives and breathes it.

615
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:49,707
You know,
it's family to us.

616
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:51,712
- Fact of the matter is
it's pretty damn hard

617
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,684
Playing football when you've
got nobody out there

618
00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:56,859
Appreciating the effort
that you're putting into it.

619
00:25:56,901 --> 00:26:00,036
- You like losing
with everybody watching?

620
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:01,845
- Well, deacon, that's what
we're trying to fix.

621
00:26:01,883 --> 00:26:03,918
[doorbell chimes]
we're trying to fix that.

622
00:26:03,956 --> 00:26:05,390
- Hmm.

623
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:07,129
- Hello.
- Oh, hey, buddy.

624
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,567
How are you?
- How are you?

625
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:10,942
- Is that buddy garrity?

626
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:12,313
- You know buddy?

627
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,584
- Do I know buddy?
[chuckles]

628
00:26:14,624 --> 00:26:16,258
- Y'all,
this is buddy garrity.

629
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:18,698
- Buddy garrity.
[laughter]

630
00:26:18,737 --> 00:26:21,739
- Mo hall,
you got to be kidding.

631
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,348
Big mo lost some weight.

632
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:25,619
- Nobody never hit harder
than buddy garrity,

633
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:26,959
I'll tell you.

634
00:26:26,997 --> 00:26:28,397
- Hey, buddy.

635
00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:30,369
- Damon gaston,
good to see you,

636
00:26:30,408 --> 00:26:31,908
Good to see you.
- Honey, buddy's here.

637
00:26:31,946 --> 00:26:32,912
- Buddy's here.

638
00:26:32,949 --> 00:26:34,416
- Hey.
- Hello, coach.

639
00:26:34,454 --> 00:26:36,655
- Hey, buddy, how are you?
It's good to see you.

640
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,928
- Good to see you.
Good to see you.

641
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:38,931
Hello, deacon.

642
00:26:38,969 --> 00:26:44,774
âª âª

643
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,055
- So is this what you
expected it to be like?

644
00:26:47,094 --> 00:26:49,062
- Not exactly.

645
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:53,271
But I really like
the lighting in here.

646
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,315
- [chuckles]

647
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:01,398
- I just don't know
how anybody meets anybody.

648
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,143
- You are asking
the wrong person.

649
00:27:05,185 --> 00:27:09,422
- But you've--you've got
the forever boyfriend, though.

650
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:11,067
- Yeah, well,

651
00:27:11,104 --> 00:27:13,472
Forever boyfriend is...

652
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:14,846
I don't know.

653
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:16,484
It's like he seems
pissed off

654
00:27:16,522 --> 00:27:18,156
About, like,
the stupidest things,

655
00:27:18,194 --> 00:27:19,794
And then we get
in these ridiculous arguments

656
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,368
That go absolutely nowhere,
and it's like--

657
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,808
It's like I don't know
how to fix us.

658
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:28,418
It's like something that's
broken or--I don't know.

659
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,261
You're not even
paying attention.

660
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,667
What are you looking at?

661
00:27:31,704 --> 00:27:33,772
- Don't look over there.

662
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:36,413
- Is that your type?

663
00:27:36,452 --> 00:27:40,121
She's cute.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

664
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:41,832
Don't flirt
while I'm gone, okay?

665
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,739
- You know me.

666
00:27:45,782 --> 00:27:47,883
- Almost what?

667
00:27:47,923 --> 00:27:51,459
[laughs]

668
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,642
- I was gonna help you
with those dishes,

669
00:28:06,683 --> 00:28:08,483
But I somehow got stuck
to the couch.

670
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:10,089
- Mm-hmm,
so it seems.

671
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:12,896
Thank you so much.
I think I got it.

672
00:28:12,936 --> 00:28:14,603
- I almost made it
back in there.

673
00:28:14,642 --> 00:28:17,243
I just got
a little tired here.

674
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:18,717
- Mmm.

675
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:20,956
I heard deacon malone
say that he was gonna

676
00:28:20,995 --> 00:28:22,463
Make some calls for you.

677
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,735
- That's because you make
a damn good steak,

678
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:26,842
Is what it is.

679
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:32,056
Hey.
- Hmm?

680
00:28:32,097 --> 00:28:35,166
- Thanks for tonight.

681
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:37,609
- Don't thank me.
Thank buddy garrity.

682
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:39,416
- Buddy garrity
ate all my damn steak.

683
00:28:39,454 --> 00:28:42,055
- [chuckles]
he sure did.

684
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:46,973
- Hey, you know what?
- Hmm?

685
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:49,580
- You're good at what you do.

686
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,121
You wear a lot of hats.

687
00:28:51,158 --> 00:28:52,592
- Thank you.

688
00:28:58,783 --> 00:29:01,051
[phone rings]

689
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,390
- Oh.

690
00:29:02,428 --> 00:29:04,195
- Goodness gracious.

691
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:07,903
[ringing continues]

692
00:29:07,945 --> 00:29:09,513
- It's not buddy.

693
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:12,887
Hello?

694
00:29:12,928 --> 00:29:14,161
Yes, sir.

695
00:29:16,774 --> 00:29:18,842
- The white kid,
he's got no record.

696
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,247
He can go.

697
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:22,519
The black kid,
he's going to juvie.

698
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,860
- His name is vince.

699
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,534
Has he made mistakes?

700
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:28,239
Hell, yeah,
the kid's made mistakes.

701
00:29:28,277 --> 00:29:29,578
You know what, though?
He shows up.

702
00:29:29,615 --> 00:29:31,249
He gets the job done.
He works hard.

703
00:29:31,287 --> 00:29:32,454
I vouch for him.

704
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,124
All I'm asking, you give him
a second chance.

705
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:37,298
- Coach, he's used up
his chances.

706
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,406
- Can I see them?

707
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,810
Thank you.

708
00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:41,582
- Coach, I can explain.
I didn't--

709
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,754
- Shh.

710
00:29:43,793 --> 00:29:48,297
Just listen.

711
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:51,276
We are at a crossroads
right now.

712
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:57,028
You are gonna admit
that everything was your fault.

713
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,537
- My dad--
- quiet.

714
00:29:58,574 --> 00:30:02,177
You are gonna cut
the tough-guy crap.

715
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:04,320
You are both gonna say

716
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,928
Exactly what
I tell you to say,

717
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:09,436
And we are gonna fix this.

718
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,510
Understood?

719
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:12,882
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

720
00:30:32,517 --> 00:30:35,719
- You get one chance
in life, fellas.

721
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:43,377
You can either
take advantage of it,

722
00:30:43,418 --> 00:30:47,121
Or you can piss it away.

723
00:30:47,163 --> 00:30:49,898
You do the latter,

724
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:53,041
And you're gonna regret it
the rest of your lives.

725
00:30:56,694 --> 00:30:58,027
Get out.

726
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,099
[locks open]

727
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:02,173
Get out of the car.

728
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:11,537
- He really took off.

729
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:14,143
He really did.

730
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:20,663
- Hey, howard,
it's this way.

731
00:31:20,704 --> 00:31:22,705
- You sure?

732
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:30,496
Thanks.

733
00:31:37,993 --> 00:31:39,994
- [scoffs]

734
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:49,425
- Go, go, go, go.
Go. Go.

735
00:31:49,462 --> 00:31:51,096
Caleb, go ahead!
Beat him!

736
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:53,436
[chuckles]

737
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:58,485
Wait, y'all slow--
okay, be careful.

738
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:02,333
- Lunches.

739
00:32:02,371 --> 00:32:03,704
Line up, line up, line up.

740
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:04,942
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

741
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:07,548
Pop! Pop! Pop!

742
00:32:07,587 --> 00:32:08,887
Hey, hey, come on,
get over here, boy.

743
00:32:08,925 --> 00:32:10,759
Come on over here.
Give me some.

744
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:11,931
Ahh!
Go get on the bus.

745
00:32:11,968 --> 00:32:13,435
Hurry up, catch 'em.
Catch 'em, now.

746
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,840
- Go get 'em!

747
00:32:14,877 --> 00:32:16,878
Daddy, they got pop warner
practice after school today.

748
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:18,218
- Okay, you take your brothers,
and I'll make sure

749
00:32:18,255 --> 00:32:20,556
They get a ride
from mrs. Turner, all right?

750
00:32:20,596 --> 00:32:22,430
- Okay, you think maybe you can
stop by just for a second?

751
00:32:22,468 --> 00:32:24,302
- Look, go on before
you miss the bus.

752
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:28,214
- Dada, I heard
what coach taylor

753
00:32:28,254 --> 00:32:31,022
Was talking to you about
the other day.

754
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:32,763
- That ain't
your business, jess.

755
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:36,037
- Daddy, oka
look, I'm sorry.

756
00:32:36,078 --> 00:32:37,946
I-I like football, okay?

757
00:32:37,984 --> 00:32:39,251
Andre loves football.

758
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:41,089
Darius loves it so much,
he throws up

759
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:43,696
Because he gets so nervous
before each game.

760
00:32:43,736 --> 00:32:44,937
But it's fine,
it really is.

761
00:32:44,974 --> 00:32:46,374
It's not your thing anymore.

762
00:32:46,412 --> 00:32:49,180
But it's still in us.

763
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:51,355
We're still
a football family.

764
00:32:51,394 --> 00:32:52,795
- Jess, it ain't
for you to decide.

765
00:32:52,832 --> 00:32:54,766
- Daddy, I'm not trying
to decide anything.

766
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,675
I'm just asking if we could
hold a pep rally here.

767
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:01,219
It'd be fun, dad.

768
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,267
- Get on before
you miss the bus.

769
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:09,145
Go ahead,
take the boys to school.

770
00:33:09,184 --> 00:33:10,518
- Yes, sir.

771
00:33:15,003 --> 00:33:17,438
- I'm hoping we get something
over that fire tonight.

772
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:20,080
So keep the eyes peeled,
light feet.

773
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:22,487
- What kind of things you think
we gonna--we gonna get?

774
00:33:22,528 --> 00:33:25,430
- Whitetail, boar.

775
00:33:28,212 --> 00:33:30,914
[gunshot]

776
00:33:30,954 --> 00:33:32,054
- 7, stop!
- What?

777
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:34,493
- What was it?
- Well, I--

778
00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:38,102
I don't--I don't--
I don't know.

779
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:40,145
- What do you mean
you don't know?

780
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,351
The wind?

781
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:42,721
- Well, I thought
I saw something,

782
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,326
But I think it might have
been the wind.

783
00:33:44,364 --> 00:33:46,198
- So you're shooting--
give me that.

784
00:33:46,237 --> 00:33:47,670
- Hey!
- No gun.

785
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,742
No gun.

786
00:33:52,222 --> 00:33:54,891
- Really? Come on,
let me have my gun back.

787
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:58,867
- The number's 555-0101.

788
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,779
- Sammy, this year the panthers
were destined for greatness.

789
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,687
But now we got
to run the table

790
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:05,494
Just to make it
to the playoffs.

791
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:07,867
You ask me, tami taylor
should send a resignation

792
00:34:07,906 --> 00:34:10,808
And a written apology.

793
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:18,822
âª âª

794
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,876
- Come on, y'all.

795
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:26,994
I just did what was right!
I did what I had to do!

796
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:29,903
I'm sorry I messed up
football for everybody!

797
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:38,317
âª âª

798
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,538
Hey.

799
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,512
I need some chocolate, please.

800
00:34:45,392 --> 00:34:47,627
So am I your boyfriend?

801
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:50,101
'cause it--it really seemed
like vince thought

802
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:51,642
That I was your boyfriend.

803
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,480
He said that
that's what you said.

804
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:55,386
- I didn't say that
to him at all.

805
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:57,560
I just said
I had a boyfriend.

806
00:34:57,598 --> 00:34:59,032
- Oh, okay.

807
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,671
Just wanted to clear that up.

808
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:01,708
- But it's not like
we're dating,

809
00:35:01,746 --> 00:35:03,380
So what does it really matter?

810
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,318
We're not.
- Okay, 100% not.

811
00:35:05,357 --> 00:35:06,324
Both: All right.

812
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,927
- See you later.

813
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,542
- College.

814
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:16,752
I'll tell you
what college was like.

815
00:35:16,794 --> 00:35:20,430
7:00 a.M. Mandatory wake-up.

816
00:35:20,472 --> 00:35:23,774
Then these fantastic
one-on-ones

817
00:35:23,816 --> 00:35:25,616
With this robotic coach
that tells you

818
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:27,622
What you're doing wrong
every single day--

819
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:28,929
Nothing like coach taylor.

820
00:35:28,966 --> 00:35:31,267
We were spoiled.

821
00:35:31,307 --> 00:35:32,707
Plus, college is boring,

822
00:35:32,745 --> 00:35:35,379
And you get a curfew
every night.

823
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,598
- You miss lyla, though?

824
00:35:44,047 --> 00:35:47,950
- I think we had
different paths.

825
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:49,094
- So does that mean yes?

826
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,330
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

827
00:35:50,368 --> 00:35:51,334
- Yeah.

828
00:35:51,371 --> 00:35:53,438
How about you?
How's dillon?

829
00:35:53,478 --> 00:35:55,012
- It's okay.

830
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:58,885
Not as bad
as I thought it'd be.

831
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:00,896
I mean, I'm getting to spend
a lot of time with my grandma,

832
00:36:00,935 --> 00:36:02,402
So that's good.

833
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:04,607
And I don't know, I make a lot
more money delivering pizzas

834
00:36:04,646 --> 00:36:06,647
With tips and stuff
than I used to make

835
00:36:06,687 --> 00:36:08,521
Over at the alamo freeze.

836
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:13,634
- So basically you stayed
in dillon 'cause of jules.

837
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,417
- Yeah.

838
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:20,690
- Yeah.

839
00:36:20,732 --> 00:36:23,400
- Now she's--she's applying
to colleges and stuff, right?

840
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,774
And I knew that was
gonna happen.

841
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:27,013
Obviously, I knew that she
was gonna go to college,

842
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,719
But I guess
I just never realized

843
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:30,758
The fact that all the colleges
she was gonna be applying to

844
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:33,465
Were, like, on the other side
of the country.

845
00:36:35,312 --> 00:36:38,547
And now, you know, I started
just getting mad at her

846
00:36:38,588 --> 00:36:39,655
For no reason.

847
00:36:39,693 --> 00:36:41,460
It's like I resent it,

848
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:43,933
But she never asked me
to stay here, you know?

849
00:36:43,973 --> 00:36:45,673
That was my decision.

850
00:36:45,712 --> 00:36:48,780
I decided to do that.

851
00:36:48,822 --> 00:36:50,823
I decided that.

852
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,937
Well...

853
00:36:55,978 --> 00:36:59,881
Texas forever, right?

854
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:01,657
- Yes.
Absolutely.

855
00:37:01,696 --> 00:37:03,697
Texas forever, 7.

856
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:14,999
- I don't know
why he changed his mind.

857
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:17,240
- Well, I think it's gonna be
a great pep rally.

858
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:19,747
- We'll see about that.
Watch your step.

859
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:22,222
- Hey, if it's not great,

860
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:25,597
You still get
to come home with us.

861
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:28,108
- There's always that.
- There's always that, right?

862
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:29,848
Go ahead.

863
00:37:29,886 --> 00:37:38,193
âª âª

864
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,813
- Hey.

865
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:13,019
- Hey.

866
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:14,158
Where's your brisket?

867
00:38:14,195 --> 00:38:17,430
- Oh, um,
I don't eat meat.

868
00:38:17,472 --> 00:38:19,172
- Oh, come on, let me
go get you a plate.

869
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:20,378
- It's okay.

870
00:38:20,415 --> 00:38:21,982
Um, I actually
kind of wanted to talk to you

871
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,120
About the other night.

872
00:38:23,157 --> 00:38:25,458
Um, I just wanted
to let you know

873
00:38:25,498 --> 00:38:27,766
That I'm not gonna
tell anybody or anything.

874
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,273
- Tell anybody what?

875
00:38:30,314 --> 00:38:31,781
- I want to thank everybody
for coming out...

876
00:38:31,818 --> 00:38:33,118
- Uh, it's okay.

877
00:38:33,156 --> 00:38:34,890
- To east dillon's
first pep rally of the year.

878
00:38:34,928 --> 00:38:36,395
[cheers and applause]

879
00:38:38,506 --> 00:38:40,140
I'd like to introduce

880
00:38:40,178 --> 00:38:42,846
One of texas' great
high school football teams--

881
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:45,988
1983 state champions
from east dillon high...

882
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,198
[cheers and applause]

883
00:38:48,237 --> 00:38:50,472
And what they brought home
to this school

884
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:51,778
26 years ago.

885
00:38:51,815 --> 00:38:53,750
[applause]

886
00:38:53,788 --> 00:38:54,855
Come on up, guys.

887
00:38:54,892 --> 00:38:56,626
- Yeah!

888
00:38:56,664 --> 00:38:59,967
- Let us pray.

889
00:39:00,008 --> 00:39:03,344
Lord...

890
00:39:03,386 --> 00:39:05,988
We are gathered here today

891
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:09,563
For a reason.

892
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:14,543
We ask you, lord,
what is a group of lions?

893
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:18,391
It is a pride.

894
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:22,370
And we stand before you
today, lord,

895
00:39:22,414 --> 00:39:24,615
Your pride.

896
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:30,462
We need pride in this world.

897
00:39:30,506 --> 00:39:31,606
[man shouts]

898
00:39:31,643 --> 00:39:34,111
- And what do we have here?

899
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,085
I said, "what do we have here?"

900
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,125
All: Pride!

901
00:39:38,163 --> 00:39:39,531
[cheers and applause]

902
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:45,414
We are the lions.

903
00:39:45,453 --> 00:39:49,757
And we stand together.

904
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:51,702
Who are we?

905
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,841
All: Lions!
- Who are we?

906
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:55,348
All: Lions!

907
00:39:55,385 --> 00:39:57,520
[cheers and applause]

908
00:40:16,888 --> 00:40:18,055
- This--yeah.

909
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:19,425
Put this one there.

910
00:40:19,462 --> 00:40:21,930
I never really wash this.

911
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:23,605
It's kind of weird.
I just--

912
00:40:23,643 --> 00:40:31,617
âª âª

913
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:49,150
- We're not dating, right?

914
00:40:49,191 --> 00:40:50,658
âª âª

915
00:40:50,696 --> 00:40:54,098
- Definitely not.
No.

916
00:40:54,141 --> 00:41:01,447
âª âª

917
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:28,445
- Lorraine, I'm tossing
this half-and-half.

918
00:41:28,484 --> 00:41:30,919
- Well, all right, but we're
gonna have to go to the store.

919
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,859
I cannot drink coffee
without cream.

920
00:41:32,898 --> 00:41:34,031
- Well, me neither.

921
00:41:34,068 --> 00:41:36,136
- Oh, I remember how you took
your coffee.

922
00:41:36,175 --> 00:41:37,676
[knock at door]

923
00:41:37,713 --> 00:41:40,882
Well, who could that be?

924
00:41:40,924 --> 00:41:43,158
[scoffs]
you failed me.

925
00:41:43,197 --> 00:41:44,898
âª âª

926
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:46,170
- Mrs. Saracen?

927
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:54,214
âª âª

928
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,348
- Thanks.

929
00:42:11,388 --> 00:42:19,395
âª âª

930
00:42:27,606 --> 00:42:29,374
Hey, uh, look.

931
00:42:29,412 --> 00:42:32,548
I'm sorry, you know, that
I just stopped by, but I--

932
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:35,958
What's the matter?

933
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,734
- Have you talked to your mom?

934
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:41,007
- Why?

935
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:44,052
Is it--is--is something wrong
with grandma?

936
00:42:44,092 --> 00:42:45,926
- I'm sorry.

937
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:48,733
- What's the matter?

938
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,675
Julie.

939
00:42:50,714 --> 00:42:53,682
- It's your dad.

940
00:42:53,724 --> 00:42:56,459
He was killed.

941
00:42:56,499 --> 00:42:59,935
Sorry.

942
00:42:59,976 --> 00:43:01,343
I'm sorry.

943
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:03,382
I'm sorry.
