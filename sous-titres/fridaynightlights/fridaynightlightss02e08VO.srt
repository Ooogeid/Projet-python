1
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:04,732
Mornin', sunshine.
Seriously, Tim, I want you gone.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,066
Need a place to crash?

3
00:00:06,348 --> 00:00:08,668
If you take care of Roscoe and Coltrane,
you're welcome.

4
00:00:08,935 --> 00:00:09,940
- Who?
- My ferrets.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,560
- Hey, Glenn, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

6
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:15,941
- Why are you meeting him in the lounge?
- That is adorable, you're jealous.

7
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:18,354
Put your hands on my hips, go ahead.
Side to side.

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,743
My dad destroyed evidence.
He's a cop.

9
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:24,543
- I've got him into this thing.
- What do you want me to say?

10
00:00:36,918 --> 00:00:37,901
Watch the pass!

11
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:51,185
<i>This Panther defense
just can't catch a break.</i>

12
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:54,298
<i>Weak on the run,
even weaker on the pass.</i>

13
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:56,486
What are you doing?
Stick him!

14
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,735
<i>37-zip
and with only quarter left to play,</i>

15
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:04,738
<i>you can call in the dogs,
because this hunt is over.</i>

16
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:08,604
Somebody's not getting laid tonight.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,358
Oh, will you just stop that!
In front of the baby, good Lord.

18
00:01:12,627 --> 00:01:15,444
- What, trouble in the bedroom?
- Honey, I said, just shup up.

19
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,685
This is why Eric's so grouchy
all the time, great.

20
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:22,620
You must be real bored if the only thing
you can talk about is our sex life.

21
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:25,371
Tell me you started up again.

22
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:26,955
We did it the once.

23
00:01:27,327 --> 00:01:29,416
Like I say,
anything less than three times a week,

24
00:01:29,678 --> 00:01:32,342
Stop it!
I'm tired Shelley.

25
00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:35,351
I know that.
Look.

26
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:38,463
There's Julie with that cute
english teacher that she has a crush on.

27
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:42,189
- She tell you that she has a crush on?
- No, she didn't tell me, but I mean,

28
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:45,681
she told me she thought he was cute
and he was really overminded and smart

29
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,645
- and very cultured.
- I don't like it. I don't trust him...

30
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:51,428
Come on!
She's a good girl.

31
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:53,738
And he doesn't seem like the type.

32
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:56,126
It's embrassing.
It's just embarrassing.

33
00:01:57,164 --> 00:02:00,698
You take it home, you sleep on it,
and then you forget about it.

34
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,796
Because monday,
we will start all over again.

35
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:05,577
Coaches' meating in 15 minutes.

36
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:14,354
Thas a good-lookin' man right there.

37
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:16,100
Wipe it down, wipe it down.

38
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,158
Smash, what the hell
are you so happy about?

39
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:20,450
- We lost the game.
- I don't got time to talk.

40
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,679
The Smash got other business.
I got appointments and engagements.

41
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:26,329
- Holler at me later and I'll try to...
- Smash, shut up!

42
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,684
What you doin' next week, Matt?
I'll tell you what you're not doin'.

43
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:32,429
You're not going on a recruiting trip
to Macnair state

44
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:35,315
where your cup's never empty,
and the girls never say no.

45
00:02:35,576 --> 00:02:38,043
It's gonna be like Cabo in my pants.

46
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:42,262
You'll get a real good education
hugging porcelain there this weekend.

47
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:53,720
My parents are gone.

48
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:56,740
They won't get back
till tomorrow night.

49
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:58,467
You could spend the night...

50
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:01,545
Yeah, I do. But...

51
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:05,822
My grandma thought
I was gonna be coming home.

52
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:09,433
She's just kind of freaks out
if I don't say good night to her.

53
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:11,305
You're so sweet.

54
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:13,793
Thanks.

55
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:49,914
Spill some spices there?

56
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:56,396
- What?
- You know, after we kinda...

57
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:57,987
Nothing happened!

58
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,301
- Nothing happened.
- I know that.

59
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,470
I know that nothing happened.
I just thought,

60
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:05,385
you know, maybe we went
to the next level of...

61
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:08,238
We kinda shared a connection.

62
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:11,845
We're not going to talk,
or even think about it, okay?

63
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,554
You unrdestand?

64
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:17,326
- Yeah.
- Good.

65
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,129
Man.

70
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:16,977
Shella's taking me to the bus.

71
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,770
Don't be silly. You know
I'm gonna take you. I'm your mama.

72
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:22,176
You forgettin' this shirt.

73
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,372
I hate the school
you're getting ready to go to.

74
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,348
It's nothin' but a party school.

75
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:29,605
You just gonna drink beer
and chase women.

76
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:32,110
- Mama, we already been through this.
- Let me finish.

77
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:33,462
You're my son.

78
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,108
When you go there,
you represent this family.

79
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:39,266
I want you to remember that
and I want you to behave yourself.

80
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:40,871
- You hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.

81
00:05:41,153 --> 00:05:42,336
I love you.

82
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:53,709
- You got a second?
- Sure.

83
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:58,417
I guess I'll just cut to the chase.
I don't know what to do anymore

84
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:00,454
to get back on the team.

85
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:03,455
I was hoping if you could say
something to coach for me.

86
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:04,556
Help me out.

87
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:06,485
Please.

88
00:06:06,747 --> 00:06:08,801
He doesn't listen to me much
with those things.

89
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:10,781
But I'll see what I can do.

90
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,032
Appreciate it.

91
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:15,457
I'll do what I can.
Take care of yourself, okay?

92
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:16,931
I will.
Thank you.

93
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:23,482
Okay, books closed, please.
Pop quiz.

94
00:06:24,214 --> 00:06:26,442
Oh, now, now, now.

95
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,650
Let's keep our eyes
on our own papers, please.

96
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,660
You'll all have ten minutes.

97
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:35,735
Excuse me, Miss Russey.

98
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,810
I need to see Tyra Collette.

99
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,679
Tyra, honey.

100
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:47,858
They need to see you in the office.

101
00:06:50,214 --> 00:06:51,219
<i>Jeff Coldwell.</i>

102
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:53,588
He's the brother of the guy
who attacked you.

103
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:56,239
Wants to talk
to some of his brother's victims.

104
00:06:56,714 --> 00:06:59,079
Make amends on behalf of his family.

105
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:04,265
Are there other people meeting with him?

106
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,419
Yeah, a few.

107
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:09,380
I mean, for many victims
of a serious crime like this,

108
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:12,098
it helps 'em get a sense of closure.

109
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:20,284
Thank you so much for this.

110
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:21,927
No problem.

111
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:25,734
Breast feeding makes me hungry
all the time.

112
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:27,688
Oh, gross.

113
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:30,179
I think Gracie threw up on your back.

114
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:32,942
- I'm serious. I think she...
- Really?

115
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:34,204
I can't see it.

116
00:07:34,364 --> 00:07:36,312
- Can you get it off?
- I don't know.

117
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:37,743
I'm eating my lunch.

118
00:07:38,077 --> 00:07:40,618
I can't believe I'm at school.
Is it really bad?

119
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:43,800
It might be easier to have Gracie
throw up on the other side, you know?

120
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,216
I think I see the virgin mary
in that vomit.

121
00:07:47,556 --> 00:07:49,147
- Oh, hey, hon.
- Why's the door shut?

122
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:51,376
Because he brought me a burger and fries

123
00:07:51,563 --> 00:07:54,249
And I didn't want everybody
to see me eating like a pig.

124
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:57,179
- How you doing, Coach?
- You want me to come back later?

125
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,939
Honey, I need to talk to you
about Tim Riggins.

126
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,957
You should think about
bringing him back.

127
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:03,977
He was like a little lost boy,
this morning.

128
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:06,126
You know, maybe if Tim
was back on the team

129
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,069
you know,
we wouldn't have lost on friday.

130
00:08:08,673 --> 00:08:09,870
I'm not, like, an expert.

131
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,288
You know what, Glenn,
can I ask you a question?

132
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:15,001
Can I talk to my wife alone
for a few minutes?

133
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:17,508
Yeah, absolutely.

134
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,897
Let me just get my stuff.
I'll get right out of your way.

135
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:23,903
Thank you so much, Glenn.
This is so delicious.

136
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,912
No problem.

137
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:26,872
Good to see you, Coach.

138
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,407
What?

139
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:36,811
Let me tell you something about Tim,
that look that you're talking about,

140
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:39,046
he's had that sily look
his whole life long,

141
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:41,807
ever since he's a little kid,
he's been using that look.

142
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:45,204
As far as everything else is concerned,
he didn't just let me down, honey.

143
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:47,518
He let the team down.
And you just don't...

144
00:08:47,678 --> 00:08:51,389
You just don't get on and off the team
like it's a bus.

145
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:55,591
Like it's a flaky kind
of real estate class.

146
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:58,231
- Or like it's a...
- You're making fun of my sister now?

147
00:08:58,502 --> 00:09:00,282
I guess I'm sort of making fun of her.

148
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:02,421
When Tim Riggins gives me something...

149
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:05,266
- I need a night out.
- I'll give something back to him.

150
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,583
I need a night out.

151
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:13,088
- You want a night out?
- I really do. I really do.

152
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,609
You know what I was thinking
we could do?

153
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,839
We could go over to Don Antonio's,

154
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,640
and we'll get couple bottles of wine
and some chocolate.

155
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,871
Then we'll get a room
over at the casa...

156
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,455
I was thinking more like bunco.
Honey, I smell like onions.

157
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:33,361
Bunco?

158
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:36,048
Like, with people, the teachers.
They're having a bunco night.

159
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,000
It would be fun. Just, I needome people,
grown-ups to talk to.

160
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,201
You know what I mean?
That'd be fun.

161
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:47,884
I gotta hide my food
before the kids...

162
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,467
There's Jamell Halloway, wide receiver.
Kid's got hands you wouldn't believe.

163
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:00,307
I saw that one-handed grab
against Oklahoma Southern.

164
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:01,627
Hey, what's up?

165
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:03,398
That was off the chain.

166
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,053
This here is Jordan.
He's our quarterback.

167
00:10:06,213 --> 00:10:09,051
Over here, this is Willis.
He's our all-american fullback.

168
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:11,756
They know who you are.
Highly recruited too.

169
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:13,695
Smash Williams.

170
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:16,596
Coach thinks that you'll be perfect
for our offense.

171
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:19,539
Well, look, it's an honor
to even be considered

172
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:22,296
for an offense as explosive
as y'all got here.

173
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:27,226
Man, how 'bout you shut the hell up
and let me work out!

174
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:30,512
Oh, I'm sorry, man. We was just...
Hey, I'm smash, man.

175
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,498
All right, man. It's cool, man.
That's Katrelle.

176
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,671
Fool's always in a bad mood, man.

177
00:10:37,547 --> 00:10:39,097
Katrelle Kennedy?

178
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:42,899
Big, dumb, and ugly.

179
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:52,933
I never seen 'em eat
out of someone's hand like that.

180
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:55,067
- Yeah?
- That is awesome.

181
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,075
You must be an old soul, man,
you know that?

182
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:02,470
You want a smoothie?

183
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:05,399
- Have a smoothie.
- I'm all right.

184
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:09,404
Come on, what's bothering you,
my friend?

185
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:13,978
I guess I miss football.
I guess I miss being around the guys.

186
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,583
That is so sad.

187
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:18,620
You're like an animal
raised in captivity.

188
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:20,188
It's like stockholm syndrome.

189
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:21,530
Yeah.

190
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,636
I just miss all that adrenaline
more than anything else.

191
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:31,272
you don't know what you want.
You know why?

192
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,086
- Why?
- 'Cause you haven't lived.

193
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:37,440
A lot more to life than football.

194
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:41,392
Tell you what. You and me, pretty boy,
we're going hunting tomorrow.

195
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:43,683
- All right.
- All right.

196
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:46,606
You need to kill yourself
some dinner, dude.

197
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:54,698
I just want to return your book
and thank you.

198
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:56,856
The world according to Garp...
it was amazing.

199
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,409
- Wow, you're fast.
- Well, I couldn't putt down.

200
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:01,712
I mean, it was smart
and funny and sad.

201
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:03,327
And, I don't know, he's a genius.

202
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:06,809
I don't know how somebody
can write that well. It was amazing.

203
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:09,251
If you like this, you'll love
<i>A prayer for Owen Meany</i>.

204
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:10,598
I'll bring it tomorrow.

205
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:14,477
Okay, um, and then I have
your Jose Gonzalez CD I promised you.

206
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,513
- Excellent. Thank you.
- It's really great.

207
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:19,353
Especially track number four.

208
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:20,809
Number four? Okay.

209
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,086
Mental note.

210
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:23,633
See you tomorrow then.

211
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:25,565
- Bye.
- See you later.

212
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:31,632
Mr. Barnett.
Can I ask you a question?

213
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,693
- Why'd you give my daughter that book?
- This?

214
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:38,779
Because it's really funny.
It's, uh... a pivotal book...

215
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:40,826
Can we, uh...
Let's see if we can...

216
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:43,136
- Let's go in here, okay?
- Okay.

217
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:53,241
It's a pretty adult book,
don't you think?

218
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,386
- It's pretty sexual.
- I'm an english teacher here,

219
00:12:57,606 --> 00:13:00,118
and I can recommend reading
to my students.

220
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,012
Well, I find you inappropriate.

221
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,278
I'm sorry you feel that way.

222
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,562
And I find you condescending.

223
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,305
I don't like you giving salacious
reading material to my daughter.

224
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:17,768
I don't like you having lunch
with her behind closed doors.

225
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:20,959
I don't like you touching each other
when you talk to each other.

226
00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:23,085
- Look. This is...
- No, listen to me.

227
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:25,385
I want you to be clear about something.

228
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,601
I can have you fired.

229
00:13:28,178 --> 00:13:30,666
I can have my husband come over
and beat the crap out of you.

230
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:33,662
And I can have you thrown into prison.
You hear what I'm saying?

231
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:37,614
- If you lay one hand on my daughter.
- Is that all?

232
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:41,003
- Do you have anything to say?
- No, thank you.

233
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:52,642
I don't understand
why he wants to meet me.

234
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:54,886
It's creepy.
Don't you think it's creepy?

235
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,101
What if they're twins?

236
00:13:57,933 --> 00:14:00,327
Probably they're not.
They're not twins.

237
00:14:00,515 --> 00:14:02,585
Why don't you tell him
that you're not gonna go?

238
00:14:02,847 --> 00:14:05,871
Because I told him I would,
and I don't want to look suspicious.

239
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:11,053
What kind of freak wants to meet
their brother's rape victim anyway?

240
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,721
What does he want?

241
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,357
I'm scared, Landry.

242
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:24,180
I don't think I'll be able
to look him in the eye.

243
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:30,864
I'll go for you.

244
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,812
I'll tell him that
you changed your mind.

245
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:40,121
All right?

246
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:57,098
She's going with me, so...

247
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:01,311
Hey. Haven't seen you here in a while.

248
00:15:01,838 --> 00:15:05,190
Me and noah were supposed to have lunch
together, but I don't know where he is...

249
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:07,047
You haven't heard yet?

250
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:09,444
Your mom got into it with him.

251
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:11,905
- She accused him of all these things.
- My mom?

252
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:15,408
She pretty much called him a pedophile.
I can't believe you haven't heard.

253
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,331
- How dare you?
- What?

254
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:23,321
You had no right whatsoever!

255
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:25,913
Not everybody out there
is having sex with each other!

256
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:27,408
What are you talking about?

257
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:30,089
You accused Noah of pedophilia
in front of the entire school!

258
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:31,738
Sweetie, lower your voice.

259
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:34,108
Why would you do
something like that to me?

260
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,472
He's the only person who listens to me
and you just get him out of my life too?

261
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:41,434
Sweetheart, I'm just your mother
I'm just trying to do what I...

262
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:44,287
No, you don't!
You don't need to do that as my mother,

263
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:46,481
or as a guidance counselor.

264
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:48,107
or even as a human being, mom!

265
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:49,810
Why would you do that?

266
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:54,208
Somebody's got to look out for you.

267
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,286
These people think
that meat is something that

268
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:03,010
magically appears
in their supermarket wrapped in plastic.

269
00:16:03,174 --> 00:16:04,332
But that ain't natural.

270
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:06,751
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I got you.

271
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:08,545
I mean, if you don't have the stomach

272
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:10,129
to take it down yourself,

273
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:11,881
you better just be eating chicken.

274
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:13,424
I agree.

275
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,844
This is awesome, man.
Did I tell you?

276
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:20,306
You know what? You're right.
It doesn't get any better than this.

277
00:16:20,568 --> 00:16:22,016
Doesn't get any better than this.

278
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,896
This is one on one.

279
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:25,562
Man versus nature.

280
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:32,402
I just feel free.

281
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:38,658
- You were right.
- Lot better than taking a hit, huh?

282
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:51,546
What's so damn funny, man?

283
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:53,298
These girls are bangin', son.

284
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,052
You gotta love life, boys.

285
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,565
That right there, that's for you.

286
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:18,064
Cloudy, I need that Dom.

287
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:19,532
So you're Smash, huh?

288
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,618
Yes, ma'am, that's right, I am.

289
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,537
Oh this is a treat,

290
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:26,164
getting my hair done.
I want it to look

291
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:28,166
- like Angie Dickinson.
- Who's that?

292
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:31,044
She's very famous actress.
You don't know who that is?

293
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:33,129
Famous, famous celebrity.

294
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:34,505
Matt, it's Smash.

295
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:36,633
I got somebody here
who wants to talk to you.

296
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,882
Is this Matt?

297
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,307
Tell me, are you as cute
as your friend Smash?

298
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:48,311
Look at these people.

299
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,112
That hairdo's cute.

300
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,517
- That's pretty.
- That's real sweet of you to do this.

301
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:57,676
- I can do that.
- You could?

302
00:18:17,151 --> 00:18:18,965
- You Jeff Caldwell?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:26,265
I'm a friend of Tyra Collette.
She's not coming.

304
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:32,021
She didn't want to. Didn't see the point
in going back to what happened.

305
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:33,500
I honestly didn't either.

306
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:37,110
Is there something you needed to say?
I'd like this to be as brief as you can.

307
00:18:37,372 --> 00:18:39,257
Look, if you could, uh...

308
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:43,533
If you could just tell her I'm sorry.
I mean, I know that's...

309
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:45,201
Why exactly are you doing this?

310
00:18:45,463 --> 00:18:48,433
Just trying to understand how my brother
could have done these things.

311
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:49,988
That's not what he was like.

312
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:54,919
One, he was a sick,
irredeemable piece of scum.

313
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:57,100
He was a poor excuse of a man.

314
00:18:57,528 --> 00:18:58,589
I don't know...

315
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:00,550
I don't know what you don't understand.

316
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:04,632
He wasn't, though. I mean, yeah,
obviously with what's happened.

317
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:06,881
yeah, he was, but...

318
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,556
I mean, he stuck up for me.

319
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,887
Fixed food for me
when mom was too drunk.

320
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:13,980
Don't. Please don't tell me about that.

321
00:19:14,242 --> 00:19:16,441
You ask anyone in Dillon,
they probably got

322
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:19,360
the same story,
and they're not off becoming rapist.

323
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:24,115
He was my brother, OK?

324
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:28,286
He's my brother.

325
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:39,150
You know? What's the purpose
of your sister even being here

326
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,596
if she can't babysit?

327
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:44,410
Honey, what part of the fact that she
has class tonight do you not understand?

328
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,846
I have to work tonight,
but I'm babysitting, aren't I?

329
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:50,745
Well, it's not babysitting
when it's your own child, sweetheart.

330
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:55,275
Wait. Why are you putting perfume on?
You're going to bunco night.

331
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:57,398
'Cause I'm trying
to mask the smell of spit-up.

332
00:19:58,061 --> 00:20:00,234
- That dress looks nice.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

333
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:02,904
Sweetie, there's extra breastmilk

334
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,611
in the freezer in case she gets thirsty,
whatever.

335
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:08,241
I love you. Have fun, have fun.
She's your baby.

336
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:10,661
- It's in the freezer?
- Thank you.

337
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:13,705
I love you. Bye.
Love you. Bye.

338
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:16,497
All right, well...
All right, I got it.

339
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,978
Roadhouse is the best action movie
of the '80s. Hands down, no doubt.

340
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:24,625
At least action movie.
Maybe all-time movie.

341
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:26,557
It's got all the key ingredients.

342
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:30,706
Town in need...
Man searching for his soul.

343
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:32,725
Hot sex, fisticuffs.

344
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:34,014
Two words:

345
00:20:34,174 --> 00:20:36,023
- Patrick...
- Swayze.

346
00:20:37,825 --> 00:20:40,503
- He's freakin' awesome.
- I know.

347
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:46,618
Need you to go in and grab some beer.
I think we're out.

348
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,479
Go ahead, grab some.
A few boxes of cold medicine too.

349
00:20:52,437 --> 00:20:54,732
Why am I getting cold medicine
at midnight?

350
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,271
I got a cold coming on, man.

351
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:25,869
Carlotta.

352
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:31,756
Carlotta.

353
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:02,005
<i>Hello?</i>

354
00:22:09,314 --> 00:22:10,314
I'm coming.

355
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:15,360
<i>I baked you some cookies.</i>

356
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,378
<i>Great.</i>

357
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:20,507
- Just throw 'em onhe table the.
- Okay.

358
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:26,797
I'm Lauren.

359
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,052
- Hello. Carlotta.
- Nice to meet you.

360
00:22:29,687 --> 00:22:31,427
You work here with Matt's grandma?

361
00:22:31,688 --> 00:22:33,178
- Yes.
- Oh, that so great.

362
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:37,016
So do you want watch TV,

363
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:40,519
- or a movie or something?
- Yeah, you two go ahead.

364
00:22:41,164 --> 00:22:42,581
She's so nice.

365
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:45,475
<i>Yeah, she's nice.</i>

366
00:22:46,026 --> 00:22:47,151
<i>She's really nice.</i>

367
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:06,879
- Hey.
- How did it go?

368
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,606
She cried all night.

369
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:15,179
Projectile pooped across the room again.
It was hard to clean up.

370
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,223
Oh no, did she really?

371
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:18,631
I'm sorry, babe.

372
00:23:21,055 --> 00:23:22,937
Did you have a good time tonight?

373
00:23:25,468 --> 00:23:26,468
I did.

374
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:28,822
Sorry it was hard for you, though.

375
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,214
Those teachers can play some bunco.

376
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:36,200
And I'll tell you what. Glen won $100,
and we went out a got a beer.

377
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:39,036
I'm gonna have to pump.

378
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:44,362
- Glenn had a good time.
- It was fun.

379
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:47,086
- Give Glenn a great time.
- Yeah, it was fun.

380
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:53,467
Honey,
you're a little bit jealous of Glenn?

381
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:59,059
Can I tell you something, seriously?

382
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:03,546
I don't like you and Glenn yukking it up
in the hallways

383
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:05,062
like a bunch of little kids.

384
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:07,278
Honey...

385
00:24:07,927 --> 00:24:09,775
What? Yukking it up?

386
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,652
It's goofy.

387
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:13,487
It's goofy?

388
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:15,614
And people are gonna start talking.

389
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:21,370
I don't like y'all running around behind
closed doors. Like the other day

390
00:24:21,632 --> 00:24:24,011
I walk in there, and he's laying
all over the couch there,

391
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:25,916
eating his sandwich and stuff.

392
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:28,847
I have to ask him to leave the room
before he even damn sits up.

393
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:30,254
I don't appreciate that.

394
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:32,673
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not ridiculous.

395
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:34,842
- Yes, it is.
- No, you know what it is?

396
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:36,302
It's disrespectful.

397
00:24:36,564 --> 00:24:37,878
It's disrespectful

398
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:40,014
to me. It's disrespectful

399
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:42,058
to this family.
That's what I'm thinking.

400
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:45,644
What about God?
Is it disrespectful to God?

401
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:47,192
That's not funny.

402
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:50,357
- Well, I mean, this is silly.
- It's not funny. You know what it is?

403
00:24:50,726 --> 00:24:53,235
It undermines us. You think about that.

404
00:24:53,497 --> 00:24:55,322
- Just think about it.
- It undermines us?

405
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,022
Yes, it undermines us.

406
00:24:58,586 --> 00:25:00,034
It does not. That is ridiculous.

407
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:03,479
One last thing
and we can leave it alone, okay?

408
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:05,790
You need to pay more attention
to your family.

409
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:13,158
How dare you?

410
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,549
Don't do that.

411
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:17,676
You know what?
You can go sleep on the couch.

412
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,760
So I can get a good night's sleep

413
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:23,004
so I pay a lot of attention
to my family tomorrow.

414
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:24,200
Go on.

415
00:25:38,072 --> 00:25:39,250
<i>I'm sleeping.</i>

416
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,944
Look, she... She went home.

417
00:25:43,563 --> 00:25:45,405
I didn't know that she was coming over.

418
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:48,499
I'm sorry.

419
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:51,252
<i>There's nothing to be sorry for.
Go to bed.</i>

420
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:08,348
Smash, this is the way we roll 24/7!
What do you think of our little paradise

421
00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:11,767
- of a college here?
- Call the dogs off. The search is over.

422
00:26:11,993 --> 00:26:13,437
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

423
00:26:13,703 --> 00:26:16,248
- We just found our missing link.
- That's right.

424
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,979
Let's see what you got, young pup.
Look around. See what you like.

425
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:22,719
Go get 'em.

426
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,464
Take your shirt off.

427
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:42,344
Let me see your tummy.

428
00:26:42,606 --> 00:26:43,975
Oh, God!

429
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:49,684
- Open this door!
- Hey, we're kind of busy!

430
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:54,607
- Open the door!
- Katrel, take your drunk ass home!

431
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:57,151
Katrell?
Katrell Kennedy, the nose guard?

432
00:26:57,413 --> 00:26:59,236
- Yes.
- Hell, no.

433
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:00,404
Oh, my God.

434
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:02,350
The hell you doing, rookie?

435
00:27:03,436 --> 00:27:05,941
I think we got started
on the wrong foot!

436
00:27:08,924 --> 00:27:10,623
It's not that dramatic!

437
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:28,015
Tell coach you found another school!

438
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,029
Hey!
Don't ever come back!

439
00:27:46,942 --> 00:27:48,689
What the hell
took you so long?

440
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:51,163
- I'm freezing.
- I got here as fast as I could.

441
00:27:51,425 --> 00:27:53,321
- You grab me some clothes?
- Here, here.

442
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:56,936
So...

443
00:27:57,661 --> 00:27:58,879
So how was your visit?

444
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:00,694
I'm not in the mood.
Let's just go.

445
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:02,929
Seriously,
was it like cabo in your pant?

446
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,903
I never ran so fast in my life.

447
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,079
On the real,
if they was timing me

448
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:09,715
I'd have ran, like, a 3.8.

449
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,019
Yeah, I think that may be the funniest
story I've ever heard in my life.

450
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,001
Glad somebody finds it funny.

451
00:28:17,443 --> 00:28:18,443
Hey, um...

452
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,610
Can I ask you a question?

453
00:28:22,192 --> 00:28:25,938
Do you know, like, a good way
to break up with somebody.

454
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,471
I don't know what to say,

455
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:29,795
I've never broken up
with a girl a day in my life.

456
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:32,316
Now you're just lying.
I'm trying to have a real talk.

457
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:33,414
On the real.

458
00:28:33,676 --> 00:28:35,916
I mean, I just tell 'em
I want an open relationship.

459
00:28:36,178 --> 00:28:37,668
I let that sentence do the work

460
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,441
and they break up with me.

461
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,416
And I come out smelling out like roses.

462
00:28:41,696 --> 00:28:44,008
Open relationship, Matty.
Magic words.

463
00:28:47,048 --> 00:28:48,050
It's okay, baby.

464
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:51,348
Just give us one second, okay?

465
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:54,211
Okay.

466
00:29:14,678 --> 00:29:15,655
Hey, hon.

467
00:29:17,354 --> 00:29:19,626
- Thank you, Shel.
- Of course, baby. Anytime.

468
00:29:23,454 --> 00:29:24,590
See you later, hon.

469
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,743
She's really upset.

470
00:29:35,903 --> 00:29:37,853
I know. I know she really is.

471
00:29:38,115 --> 00:29:39,146
She's embarrassed.

472
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:42,831
I don't think I need a mediator
to help me with my daughter, Shelly.

473
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:44,860
I know you think you were right.

474
00:29:45,122 --> 00:29:47,235
And honestly,
most of the time you are right

475
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:49,755
but in this situation,
do you really think

476
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:52,689
that reaming that guy a new one
in front of the entire school?

477
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:55,079
You really think that was
the best way to handle this?

478
00:29:55,341 --> 00:29:57,851
I did not ream that guy...
in front of the entire school.

479
00:29:58,011 --> 00:30:00,791
- That's what Julie said happened
- Well, I'm sure she said that.

480
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:03,358
But you have no idea
what really happened.

481
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:05,339
And, you know franckly,
you're not a mother.

482
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:08,421
So you have no idea
what the situation was that I was in.

483
00:30:08,581 --> 00:30:10,983
My God. Sometime,
we are gonna have a whole conversation

484
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,928
where you don't say that to me.

485
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,438
Seriously, Tami, honestly.

486
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:25,442
If mom had done that,
how would you have felt?

487
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:40,404
I probably would have felt mortified.

488
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,077
Exactly.

489
00:30:51,848 --> 00:30:55,021
Thou dost preparest a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.

490
00:30:55,181 --> 00:30:56,531
My cup overflows.

491
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:58,741
Surely goodness and love kindness

492
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:00,703
will follow me all the days of my life.

493
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:04,624
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever and ever.

494
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,962
So what does that mean to us?
What does that mean to you? Me?

495
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,782
That means if we put our trust

496
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,449
in the Lord,
his promises will...

497
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:16,769
open up to us.
We will see his promises.

498
00:31:17,098 --> 00:31:18,537
Dors everybody understand?

499
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:20,581
Should we trust God?
Should we believe him?

500
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,901
Should we put God first?
Yes.

501
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:26,295
His promises are right here.
Dwell in the land.

502
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:28,622
- Paul, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

503
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:30,723
And cultivate faithfulness.

504
00:31:33,081 --> 00:31:34,081
Hey, Landry.

505
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:36,138
You okay?

506
00:31:37,017 --> 00:31:37,796
Yeah.

507
00:31:38,883 --> 00:31:41,446
You look like maybe
you needeed some company.

508
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:47,916
I mean, you can sit if you want.

509
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:51,208
Okay.

510
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:02,178
So are you a good christian
or a bad christian, Lyla Garrity?

511
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:07,002
I try and be a good christian.

512
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:08,834
So, uh...

513
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:14,301
It's not always so easy to tell, though.

514
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:18,430
I don't think any of us are perfect.

515
00:32:20,924 --> 00:32:22,097
I know I'm not.

516
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:23,685
Are you?

517
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,357
Not so much.

518
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,279
I've had this secret...

519
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:35,781
for a while now,

520
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:39,075
and it's starting to literally
just eat away at me.

521
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,931
Seems so easy to just tell the truth,
to get it all off your chest.

522
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:45,026
To do the right thing.
Seems so easy to do.

523
00:32:45,186 --> 00:32:47,656
I've got so many people
involved in this.

524
00:32:49,752 --> 00:32:51,554
I just don't know what to do.

525
00:32:51,714 --> 00:32:54,216
I don't think there's anything
wrong in telling the truth.

526
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:56,165
I think that...

527
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:01,212
telling the truth is a way
of surrendering to God.

528
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:05,762
Man, I don't what would happen
if I were to do that.

529
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:06,863
I mean...

530
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,241
That's why they call it faith.

531
00:33:21,722 --> 00:33:23,186
Just tell the truth, huh?

532
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:24,997
Just tell the truth.

533
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:43,876
Go on, Matty.
You can do.

534
00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:51,985
Call you guys later.
Bye.

535
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,028
- How's it going?
- Good, you?

536
00:33:55,188 --> 00:33:56,681
- Good.
- That's good.

537
00:33:57,498 --> 00:33:59,364
Can we maybe talk for a minute?

538
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:00,843
Yeah, of course.

539
00:34:01,295 --> 00:34:04,272
I was just thinking maybe
we should try and have, like...

540
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:07,976
an open relationship.

541
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:09,625
What?

542
00:34:09,887 --> 00:34:11,582
Like, an open relationship.

543
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:14,171
Like, you wanna be with another girl?

544
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:16,632
- No, I don't want to.
- What did I do?

545
00:34:16,894 --> 00:34:18,175
You're perfect, you're great.

546
00:34:18,437 --> 00:34:20,085
I told you this
about my ex-boyfriend.

547
00:34:20,245 --> 00:34:23,430
- It's not like that.
- Honestly, don't touch me, okay?

548
00:34:23,746 --> 00:34:26,131
Stay out of my way, Matt.
Okay?

549
00:34:26,653 --> 00:34:27,392
Okay.

550
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:33,857
See? Problem solved!

551
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:36,235
What happened to coming out
smelling like roses?

552
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:38,170
That part don't always work.

553
00:34:38,396 --> 00:34:41,657
Yeah, has it ever worked out?
You ever seen that work out?

554
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:24,476
Like how I decorated?

555
00:35:34,484 --> 00:35:36,118
Good thing you're a cool dude.

556
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:38,380
Or I'd have to kill you.

557
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,938
Let's go!
Let's hear it now!

558
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,106
Spread 'em.

559
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:58,524
Stretch it out good,
gentlemen.

560
00:35:58,739 --> 00:35:59,896
Lean it, lt!

561
00:36:00,684 --> 00:36:01,520
Coach.

562
00:36:01,886 --> 00:36:02,872
To the right.

563
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,043
What the hell are you doing?

564
00:36:05,203 --> 00:36:07,008
What the hell are you doing
in my uniform?

565
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:08,620
It's still my uniform, coach.

566
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,830
What the hell are you doing
in my uniform and my field, Riggins?

567
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:14,291
- I'm not getting off the field, Coach.
- You're not?

568
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:16,724
You're get off my damn field
if I tell you to.

569
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:19,596
I'm not leaving. I'll do whatever
it takes to stay on this field.

570
00:36:19,756 --> 00:36:22,467
You didn't just let me down,
you let yourself down,

571
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:24,956
you let the damn team down.
You understand that?

572
00:36:25,423 --> 00:36:27,179
All right, then.
Get off my damn field.

573
00:36:28,692 --> 00:36:29,658
Let's go!

574
00:36:30,324 --> 00:36:32,221
Six! Call it out!
Let's go!

575
00:36:32,946 --> 00:36:34,605
What'd I tell you?
Get out of here.

576
00:36:34,765 --> 00:36:35,854
I can't hear you!

577
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,355
Left over right.

578
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:40,966
Hang it!

579
00:36:43,421 --> 00:36:45,130
What the hell you think you're going?

580
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,514
What's up, Rig?

581
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:56,877
We have not playing since pee-wee,
and I let you down.

582
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:59,274
And I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

583
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:00,971
Thanks, Rig.
I appreciate it.

584
00:37:07,053 --> 00:37:07,886
4-6.

585
00:37:09,476 --> 00:37:10,411
Hey, look,

586
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:13,835
I don't ever recall seeing you play
in any of the games.

587
00:37:13,995 --> 00:37:15,894
I don't think you ever will.

588
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:18,181
But I can tell you,
the effort you put forth

589
00:37:19,605 --> 00:37:22,258
on practice days is undeniable.

590
00:37:22,987 --> 00:37:24,085
Thanks, man.

591
00:37:28,009 --> 00:37:28,856
2-0.

592
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:30,726
You know, to be honest, I just...

593
00:37:30,886 --> 00:37:32,744
I know you try and sleep
with a lot of girls

594
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:34,400
that I've previously slept with

595
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,720
so just left town for a bit
to give you a break.

596
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:37,903
You know?

597
00:37:38,661 --> 00:37:40,201
You lose that virginity yet?

598
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:42,262
We're good, man.
It's good to have you back.

599
00:37:42,422 --> 00:37:43,281
I, uh...

600
00:37:44,868 --> 00:37:47,714
I apologize to eveyone here.

601
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:49,970
And if you can find it
within yourselves

602
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:52,272
to let me make it up to you
in the showers.

603
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,599
I appreciate it.

604
00:37:54,986 --> 00:37:56,042
Listen up.

605
00:37:56,863 --> 00:37:58,478
Your penance isn't paid up yet.

606
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,235
Wipe that stupid smile off you face.
Go take your spot.

607
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:02,350
Let's go!

608
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:06,570
Come on!
Call 'em out, let's go.

609
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,610
Get out of my spot, rookie.

610
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:11,241
Bring it up!

611
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,449
- Hi.
- Hi.

612
00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:26,882
Where's everyone?

613
00:38:27,717 --> 00:38:30,512
Julie and Shelly took baby Grace
to the mall

614
00:38:30,672 --> 00:38:32,137
to buy her some new baby clothes.

615
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,241
Which is very sweet.

616
00:38:35,308 --> 00:38:36,308
That's good.

617
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:44,733
I can't not have a friend

618
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:46,960
at school that I, you know,

619
00:38:47,173 --> 00:38:49,321
spend time what, for 20 minutes a day.

620
00:39:10,108 --> 00:39:11,603
It's not about Glen.

621
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:15,847
Don't give a damn about Glen.
I'm supposed to be the one

622
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:18,423
that you're yukking it up with
in the hallways.

623
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,894
I'm supposed to be the one
that you're laughing with.

624
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:24,947
I Miss you.

625
00:39:32,356 --> 00:39:33,531
I Miss you too.

626
00:39:39,216 --> 00:39:40,384
I like you.

627
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:43,905
- You do?
- Yeah, I like you.

628
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:45,261
I like you too.

629
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:01,226
I broke up with Lauren.

630
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:04,913
I don't know why
you're telling me uhis, Matt.

631
00:40:05,073 --> 00:40:09,044
Because she was really nice
and really hot

632
00:40:09,204 --> 00:40:11,739
and I had absolutely
no reason not to like her.

633
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:14,572
Except that I can't stop
thinking about you.

634
00:40:15,351 --> 00:40:17,006
Look, I know you work here,

635
00:40:17,307 --> 00:40:19,286
and I'm not trying
to make anything weird,

636
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:22,035
but I like you,

637
00:40:22,526 --> 00:40:23,399
a lot.

638
00:40:23,885 --> 00:40:26,206
And I just want to spend
every second I can with you

639
00:40:26,366 --> 00:40:29,004
or around you.
I just want you to know that.

640
00:41:03,202 --> 00:41:04,667
- Look, I...
- No.

641
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:07,108
I need to speak to someone
about the murder of Mike Caldwell.

642
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:09,020
What is it, son?

643
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,170
I did it.

644
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:19,531
I killed him.
