1
00:00:05,017 --> 00:00:09,189
- <i>Just three days, folks, until...</i>
- Oh, I'm sorry... I didn't mean to...

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,808
When our Panthers take on the Rattlers.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,940
Okay, I got it.
You can just go back to sleep

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,060
if you want to.

5
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:23,028
Morning.

6
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:26,854
Landry, um,

7
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:29,665
I'm sure whatever
that you're about to say

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,283
is gonna make perfect sense
and be absolutely practical.

9
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:35,438
And basically ruin
the best night of my life.

10
00:00:36,473 --> 00:00:37,610
Well, this...

11
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,326
This just can't happen again.

12
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:40,848
- Okay.
- All right?

13
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:43,120
I... I have to go.

14
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:44,885
- I'll see you.
- At school...

15
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:47,180
You'll see me at school.

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,595
It'll all be fine.

17
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,145
- Just gonna go out the window?
- Yeah, I'm just gonna go here.

18
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:55,129
- You need some help?
- No, I'm good. I'm good.

19
00:00:55,249 --> 00:00:56,857
Yeah, I'll see you.

20
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:59,399
- You got it?
- Yeah, good.

21
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:24,006
I'll talk to you later.
Bye, baby.

22
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:38,592
I gotta get going.

23
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:41,434
Well that just sucks.

24
00:01:45,435 --> 00:01:48,686
We're all waiting to see how Coach
MacGregor can pick up the slack

25
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:50,877
after he who shall remain nameless,

26
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:53,797
- A.K.A. Coach Taylor,
- A.K.A. Judas.

27
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,627
He cashed in on us
by taking his college job,

28
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,051
just as fast as was humanly possible.

29
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,657
Hey, Coach, here's your order.

30
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:04,592
I know you're in a hurry to hit
the road. Sorry about the radio.

31
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:06,787
It's fine.
Hey, thanks guys.

32
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:12,552
Hey, coach.

33
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:15,304
Hey, Matt.
How you doing?

34
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:21,552
I just wanted to apologize
for everything with Julie.

35
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:25,222
- Apologize for what?
- It's just that we broke up.

36
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:27,516
I didn't know
that you were broke up.

37
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:30,207
She probably doesn't
want to bother you...

38
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:33,883
Like, you know, stress you or,
you know, while you're in Austin.

39
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,044
Tell... Tell Miss Taylor
I'm sorry too.

40
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:44,241
Come on, Riggins!

41
00:02:44,503 --> 00:02:45,701
You have this half-assed,

42
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:47,661
candy-assed,
lame-assed,

43
00:02:47,923 --> 00:02:50,034
whiskey breath,
dirty hair attitude.

44
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,561
You'll wake up in the morning
and find your career gone!

45
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:55,014
Like a memory, like a postcard,
like a bad dream!

46
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,545
Like a love affair, a night train!

47
00:02:56,874 --> 00:02:59,110
Get those knees up in the air
and get that tire up!

48
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:00,424
Wear it like a crown!

49
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:01,945
Praise the game of football!

50
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:04,744
That's what I want to see.
Show me something!

51
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:06,472
That's it... Yeah!

52
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:07,765
You earned it now.

53
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:10,816
Get up, Riggins!

54
00:03:11,964 --> 00:03:13,270
Get a trainer in here!

55
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:14,396
Get up.

56
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,992
Give him some room.

57
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:45,825
2x02: ARE YOU READY FOR FRIDAY NIGHT?

61
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:30,702
I don't know what the hell you think
you're doing to yourself, Tim.

62
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:32,017
You're completely dehydrated,

63
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:34,017
your body went into shock,
and whose wouldn't?

64
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:36,854
I don't understand
what you're trying to do to yourself.

65
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:40,066
The front desk can't get a hold of Billy
to come down and pick you up.

66
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:42,150
Yeah, he's probably screwing
my ex-girlfriend.

67
00:04:42,743 --> 00:04:46,071
And we can't release you
without an adult signature.

68
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:48,541
So, any other relative
we could call?

69
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:50,016
No.

70
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:55,306
Okay.
We'll keep trying Billy.

71
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:58,721
You ready for Friday?

72
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
Always, sir.

73
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:02,112
Attaboy.

74
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:10,382
How you feeling?

75
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:14,944
I am feeling a bit better now.

76
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:17,436
You should try going to practice
without a hangover.

77
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:19,730
I hear it's a totally different game.

78
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:21,773
Yeah, that's kind of what I'm afraid of.

79
00:05:27,724 --> 00:05:29,846
So, uh, you just come here
to check up on me?

80
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:32,993
I'm here as a friend.

81
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:37,282
It's the least I could do after you
helped me with my dad the other night.

82
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:41,997
What?

83
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,594
What?

84
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,466
I think you should come
to my church.

85
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,215
Is this, like, a recruitment
deal you got going?

86
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,403
- You know, get 'em when they're down?
- No... I care about you, Tim.

87
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,523
I care about you.

88
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,604
And I see that you're lost,
which is exactly how I felt.

89
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:02,084
I'm not lost.

90
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,231
This is Dillon.

91
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,402
It's home of the Panthers, right?

92
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:10,864
You can be lost
in Dillon, you know?

93
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:30,962
All right, let me ask you.

94
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:33,573
Are you trying to be a cliche?

95
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:36,125
*stem cell surgery in Mexico?

96
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:38,145
Oh! Oh, let me check
my watch.

97
00:06:38,738 --> 00:06:41,322
Yep, been about a year.
Yeah, you're actually right on time

98
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,651
for the miracle surgery
portion of the show.

99
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:45,876
It's not a miracle surgery.

100
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,882
I'm not crazy, all right.
This isn't insane.

101
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:52,335
They've great results with rats. Getting
movement back in their hind legs.

102
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,594
I hate to break it to you,

103
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,701
but you don't have hind legs,
so you're screwed.

104
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:59,043
I wanted to walk too.
We all did.

105
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:03,327
But you actually thinking
you're gonna do it again,

106
00:07:04,472 --> 00:07:06,378
people will take advantage
of that, Street.

107
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:09,870
They'll take your money
and what's left of your dignity.

108
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:12,227
It's a scam, QB.

109
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,594
Don't say you weren't warned.

110
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:17,347
Come on, let's go!

111
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,195
Coach, I don't think
this is gonna work.

112
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:34,050
Son, it's a five-step drop.

113
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:36,383
You settle in, find the lane,
get rid of the ball.

114
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:38,450
Is there anything magical to that?

115
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,786
Come on, let's go.

116
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:43,571
Trust me.

117
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:49,838
Now with, uh, with Jackson,
we got the height problem of course.

118
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,995
He's having trouble seeing the lanes.

119
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:55,635
- I'll put him in a shorter...
- Cut the kid loose. We don't need him.

120
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,668
Well, coach, I think that's
a bit premature.

121
00:07:58,788 --> 00:07:59,806
He's got some talent.

122
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:02,359
Just cut the boy.
He's not performing.

123
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,959
We don'tave time to waste with this.

124
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,980
Tell him he's gone and start focusing
on that kid from Midland.

125
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:10,052
You... You want me to tell him?

126
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:11,401
Yeah.

127
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,531
Hey, babe.
How you doing?

128
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:18,825
Hey, baby.
How's your day going?

129
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:20,202
Going all right.

130
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:21,656
I have the distinct privilege

131
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:23,749
of cutting one of the kids
from the team today.

132
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,468
Oh, I'm sorry.

133
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:28,556
Hey, did you try turning it off,
then turning it on again?

134
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:30,021
- Yes, yes.
- Okay.

135
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:32,380
- Who's that?
- That's Glenn, darling.

136
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:33,865
What's he doing at the house?

137
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:37,279
Glenn is here helping me at the moment
try to get the ice maker to work.

138
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,233
I don't want Glenn
with his hands in my wife's ice box.

139
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,549
I'll fix it
when I get home on the weekend.

140
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,095
All right. That would be great.

141
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:46,561
Well, um, is that what you called
to talk to me about?

142
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:48,228
No. Listen.

143
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:50,941
Did you forget to tell me
that Julie and Matt broke up?

144
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,500
No, Julie and Matt didn't break up.

145
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:54,528
Yeah, they did.

146
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:57,572
It's all over the school.
It's huge, everybody's talking about it.

147
00:08:57,834 --> 00:09:00,325
Hey babe, tell Glenn to sit down
and be quiet.

148
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:04,121
No, honey, I did not know
that Julie and Matt broke up.

149
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:06,433
Don't you think
that's a little bit of a problem?

150
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:10,201
I do, I think that's a problem
that she didn't say anything to me.

151
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:14,097
What would you say is the main
difference in this year's team?

152
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:16,914
For one, Coach "M"
is stressing the running game.

153
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:18,845
That's for one and, uh...

154
00:09:18,986 --> 00:09:21,555
If he wants to put the ball in my hands,
I know I can carry it.

155
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:24,205
- As in carry the team?
- Ha, no...

156
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,296
I wouldn't say that,
but I'll put it like this.

157
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,645
The Smash is in the zone
like never before.

158
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:31,815
- Oh, I'm ready to run with that ball.
- Saracen, you hearing this guy?

159
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:33,150
He's out of control,
man.

160
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:35,370
Listen, somebody's gotta say
something to him.

161
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,903
I'll say something.

162
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:43,535
Tim Riggins?

163
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:44,661
Mr. Garrity?

164
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:46,465
Yeah.
You doing okay?

165
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:48,268
- Yes, sir.
- Good, good.

166
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:51,251
You've been
through a traumatic experience.

167
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:53,420
I'm gonna sign you out right now.

168
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:56,812
That guy's pushing you guys
way too hard.

169
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:59,718
He's got you out there
running in the hot, blazing sun.

170
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:00,982
Showing no mercy.

171
00:10:01,587 --> 00:10:03,675
And I got from my inside sources

172
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:06,517
that the practices have been
running over 15 minutes.

173
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,357
Ran over today.

174
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,300
It's no wonder you passed out.

175
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:16,776
Actually, I think I passed out
'cause I was hungover, Mr. Garrity.

176
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:21,528
Sir?

177
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,419
I want you to listen to me,
Tim Riggins.

178
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:28,127
I don't want to ever hear
you say that again.

179
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:30,165
I've seen you play
with a hangover

180
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:32,292
many times
and you played like a champ.

181
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:33,877
This is because of that coach.

182
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,336
This is all about MacGregor,

183
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:37,667
and I don't want you
to put any of it on yourself.

184
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
Okay?

185
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:42,769
Okay.

186
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,272
Hey, Smash,
can I talk to you for a minute?

187
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:50,379
Sure, Matty. What's up?

188
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,268
Look, some of the guys on the team
have kind of been talking a little bit.

189
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,295
Some of the guys, huh?

190
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:00,747
They kind of feel, like,
there's sort of some inequity.

191
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,884
What are you bringing out
the $10 words on me for, man? What's up?

192
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:07,295
Smash, you're not the only
person on this team.

193
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,891
- Yeah, I know that.
- Then why don't you act like it?

194
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:12,249
I mean, this team's
kind of just falling apart.

195
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,337
We're supposed to be leaders,
so we...

196
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,353
Look, look... Matty, matty...
Ain't none of this my fault.

197
00:11:17,473 --> 00:11:20,352
If y'all are mad 'cause Coach
is making this a running offense,

198
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,108
go talk to him.
Ain't nothing I can do about it.

199
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:25,414
There's nothing you can do about it?

200
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:27,597
You want me to go tell him
to change his strategy?

201
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:31,643
No, but I want you to act like a captain
because you are the captain.

202
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:33,325
So step up and try...

203
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:36,277
Oh, so you pissed
'cause he made me captain.

204
00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:39,087
No, I don't care that he made
you captain. I really do not.

205
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:41,716
I'm sorry he's not using you
the way that coach Taylor did.

206
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:45,031
You want to get real? Let's get real.
Yeah, I'm loving this.

207
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:47,791
Why shouldn't I?
It's my year. I'm a senior.

208
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:49,619
Why shouldn't I be the star?

209
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:52,998
This is my recruitment year.
Okay, my future's on the line

210
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,291
every Friday night.

211
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:56,716
I gotta do what's best for me right now.

212
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:59,728
And at the end of this,
I'll graduate and it'll be your turn.

213
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:00,964
Live with it, Matt.

214
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:11,364
Say, girl.

215
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:14,816
Why don't you step up
into my g-ride?

216
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:25,747
Hey, girl.

217
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:29,218
Got you some clean laundry, finally.

218
00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:37,311
It's okay, you can just leave it there.
I'll deal with it.

219
00:12:37,431 --> 00:12:38,626
I don't mind, sweetheart.

220
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:41,671
So did I hear that you
and Matt Saracen broke up?

221
00:12:42,384 --> 00:12:43,384
Yep.

222
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:45,508
How you doing with that?

223
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:47,546
Fine.

224
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,585
- Well, who broke up with who?
- Mom, look...

225
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:53,972
I really just don't really
want to talk about it, okay?

226
00:12:57,273 --> 00:12:59,829
- Was it 'cause of that boy at the pool?
- No.

227
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:08,948
Honey. I just want you to know
I'm here for you, hon.

228
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,667
And you can always talk to me.

229
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:13,474
Okay.

230
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:15,476
Thanks.

231
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:20,001
I think your baby's crying.

232
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:33,518
There's not really
any prime time apples.

233
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:44,662
There we go.

234
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,546
It's a good catch, Smash.
Take a little bit of air off that.

235
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:49,823
Good catch, Smash.

236
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:53,692
Look at this, look at this. Ladies,
glad you decided to join us today.

237
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:55,120
Let's get a little jog going.

238
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,682
That means you too, Saracen.

239
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,746
Red jersey does not mean
you get to walk<today.

240
00:13:59,052 --> 00:14:00,568
Opening day is upon us, gentlemen!

241
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:02,127
Get your asses in motion.

242
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,334
Bradley, didn't we tell you
to lose that baby fat in the off season.

243
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:06,798
Can't tell?
I lost three pounds!

244
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,199
Tip of the iceberg, Bradley.

245
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:09,684
Stairmaster is your friend, okay?

246
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,178
Gentlemen, we get better
or we get worse every day.

247
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,180
Let's get a little better
today.

248
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:19,018
We need Riggins to bring
his "A" game Friday night.

249
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,716
Why don't you go and talk to him?

250
00:14:20,836 --> 00:14:22,767
You know, pump him up.
Can you do that?

251
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:23,815
Yes, sir.

252
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,650
Thank you, Coach.

253
00:14:28,656 --> 00:14:29,656
Thank you, Coach.

254
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:33,408
All right.

255
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:35,715
All right.

256
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,479
Riggins.

257
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:41,835
Timmy.

258
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,879
- Tim!
- Yeah.

259
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,349
- Timmy, open the damn door!
- Yeah.

260
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:51,692
What's going on, jay?

261
00:14:52,151 --> 00:14:54,134
Missed you at practice today, Riggs.

262
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:56,404
Yeah, doc told me to rest, so...

263
00:14:57,461 --> 00:15:00,226
- I'm resting.
- Yeah, he prescribe you a 12-pack too?

264
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:01,613
No, that was me.

265
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:03,620
What the hell you doing, Tim?

266
00:15:05,132 --> 00:15:06,155
Seriously.

267
00:15:06,736 --> 00:15:09,009
Am I talking to coach street
or friend street,

268
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:11,070
because you've been
pretty confused lately.

269
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:12,979
Don't go there, all right?

270
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:15,736
Did coach MacGregor give you
a gold star for this one?

271
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,727
Shut the hell up, Riggins!
That's not what this is about.

272
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:21,447
This isn't about coach and me.
This is about you.

273
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:24,083
Tim, look at yourself.
You're a screw-up.

274
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:26,481
You're the one that didn't show up.

275
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:28,083
The one that's always late.

276
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:30,158
The one that doesn't take
your life seriously.

277
00:15:31,024 --> 00:15:32,759
You know, when you make the choice

278
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:34,724
between friend and coach,

279
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:38,515
pick friend
'cause you make a lousy coach.

280
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,268
Clean yourself up,
and get your ass to practice.

281
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:49,831
Great coaching tactic. I mean,
that fire under my ass has been lit!

282
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,611
Go to hell, Riggins.

283
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,010
Go to hell, Tim.

284
00:15:58,618 --> 00:16:00,068
Hey, Carlotta?

285
00:16:00,382 --> 00:16:01,387
Yes?

286
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:03,207
I'm noticing sort of a little bit

287
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:05,841
of... of... of a trend going on.

288
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:07,219
A trend?

289
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:10,837
Yeah, it seems like everybody's laundry
gets done except for mine,

290
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:14,067
grandma's got a lot of clean clothes
and I see some of yours.

291
00:16:14,913 --> 00:16:17,303
And I got...
And I got no clean socks.

292
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:19,180
Oh, than I suggest
you wash some.

293
00:16:19,442 --> 00:16:20,839
Right, and I will wash...

294
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,456
It's just, I gotta go to school.

295
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:25,828
And I got two practices a day
and I gotta go to work. So...

296
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,441
I just sorta thought that maybe
you'd be helping out in that whole area.

297
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,443
Why?
Because I have brown skin?

298
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,816
No, not because...

299
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:37,717
I didn't think it was that crazy
of an idea to think that maybe...

300
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:39,325
I have a job:

301
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:41,244
taking care of your grandmother.

302
00:16:41,506 --> 00:16:43,580
I'm a caregiver, not a maid.

303
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:45,702
I'm an "A" student.

304
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:48,650
My father in Guatemala is a teacher.

305
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:51,773
And my mother runs
an insurance office.

306
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:53,923
I came here to put myself
through college.

307
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:56,882
To study to be a nurse.
To help people.

308
00:16:57,564 --> 00:16:58,886
And not to do your laundry.

309
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:01,938
Right, but doing laundry helps people.

310
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:10,505
The washing machine is over there.

311
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,450
- How's my girl?
- All right.

312
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:21,390
Landry, how was school today?

313
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,510
You know, not bad.
Same ol' same ol'.

314
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,713
You makin' any new or different friends
now that you're a panther?

315
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,159
Not... Not really.

316
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,406
Pretty much
just the same old friends.

317
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:33,796
You gotta be meeting
some girls, don't you?

318
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:38,788
I mean, maybe a little bit.

319
00:17:39,486 --> 00:17:41,655
But nothing...
Nothing to write home about.

320
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:44,454
Mom got these crackers that you like.

321
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:46,684
Oh, that is sin in a box.

322
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:48,853
Hey, bubba.
Where's your watch?

323
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,451
It's in... It's in the drawer.
I had it cleaned.

324
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:55,576
Glad to hear
you're taking good care of it.

325
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:57,670
That watch has been
in the family over 60 years.

326
00:17:57,895 --> 00:17:59,853
Your grandpa's gonna want
to see you wearing it

327
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:01,366
when he comes, next month.

328
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:04,463
- He's gonna see it.
- Baby, what's for dinner?

329
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,858
Uh, pork chops...
And wild rice, and caesar salad.

330
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,130
Good practice.

331
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:17,608
Pick it up, guys!

332
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:21,329
Yeah, we need to talk.

333
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,304
Let me talk to you
after practice, all right?

334
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:25,431
No, actually I mean in person.

335
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,780
- It's important.
- What's it about?

336
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,060
I can't tell you.

337
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:31,215
What do you mean?
Is someone dead? What?

338
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:32,146
If I told you,

339
00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:34,634
you wouldn't come, that's why.
Now listen.

340
00:18:34,754 --> 00:18:36,428
Uh, I'll meet you half way.

341
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:38,742
Two hours
for each of us to drive there.

342
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:41,136
Don't to this. I'm not gonna come
somewhere to meet you

343
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:43,032
when you tell me
that if I knew what it was

344
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:45,307
I wouldn't come in the first place.

345
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:47,704
Eric, you need to make time for this.

346
00:18:48,716 --> 00:18:51,066
I'm telling you this as your friend.

347
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,775
It's important.

348
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,983
I'll call you back.

349
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:58,256
Let's go, break it down!

350
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:04,894
Another productive day
at the office I see.

351
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:12,603
You screwing jackie?

352
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:18,148
Why would you ask me that?

353
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:21,362
'Cause I saw you sneaking out
of her place at 6:00 in the morning.

354
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:27,679
Look, I...

355
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,912
I would've told you.

356
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,248
Jackie wasn't comfortable with it.

357
00:19:33,332 --> 00:19:35,710
We've been seeing each other
for about six weeks now.

358
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:37,705
It's pretty serious.

359
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:41,790
You didn't really think
that you two were gonna ever have

360
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,899
any some... some kind
of serious relationship, did you?

361
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,044
Why not?

362
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:49,807
'Cause she's a 33-year-old woman
and you're a 17-year-old kid.

363
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:51,934
You can't even take care of yourself.

364
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:54,020
How were you planning
on taking care of her?

365
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:56,455
No, come here when
I'm talking to you, Tim.

366
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:57,575
Tim!

367
00:21:03,476 --> 00:21:05,779
Jesus said, "if you will just repent

368
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:08,295
"and be sorry for your past,

369
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,389
"I will take all of your past away.

370
00:21:12,283 --> 00:21:14,996
"just say 'forgive me, forgive me

371
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:16,526
of my past.'"

372
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:17,900
and then he said,

373
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,689
"follow me at my burial."

374
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:23,745
First of all, you follow
Jesus in his death.

375
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:26,665
You have a past
that you cannot do away with.

376
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:29,176
You have a past that
if you even think about it,

377
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:32,463
it brings so many
horrible memories to you.

378
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,251
I know the drugs
and I know all the immorality.

379
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:38,416
And I know all the things you've done

380
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,870
because I deal with it every day

381
00:21:41,264 --> 00:21:42,472
in different people.

382
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:46,232
I speak to that special person again
in this building,

383
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:49,331
that you think God no longer loves you.

384
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:53,222
He loves you very, very much.

385
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:55,266
And the person that invited you

386
00:21:55,528 --> 00:21:56,934
to come to church tonight

387
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:59,083
is God's agent.

388
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,036
He used that agent

389
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,314
so that you could be brought back

390
00:22:03,464 --> 00:22:04,650
into the presence of God.

391
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:09,363
And tonight, he is going to touch you.

392
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:36,534
When I win that game on Friday,

393
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:38,648
you gotta give me a massage.

394
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:40,150
Hmm, like a full body massage?

395
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:43,208
Yeah, I'm gonna need that deep tissue.
You good with that?

396
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:47,108
You didn't happen to bring any
of those burgers up rom the freezer?

397
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,666
I've been on the counter.
I've been busy.

398
00:22:49,957 --> 00:22:51,614
I can see that you've been real busy.

399
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:54,700
Hey, would you calm down, Mr. Manager?
I'm doing my job, okay?

400
00:22:54,962 --> 00:22:56,953
You working it all right.
It's going real quick.

401
00:22:58,674 --> 00:23:01,624
Come on. We gotta get the healing
going on, got an opening game Friday.

402
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:04,389
So maybe if you get to work,
and I do my work,

403
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:07,387
then we can get out of here quicker
and start thinking about our game.

404
00:23:18,233 --> 00:23:20,390
This one kind of looks like it.

405
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,174
It really doesn't look anything like it,

406
00:23:22,343 --> 00:23:25,965
except for the fact that they are both
watches and have hands and tell time.

407
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:42,423
You don't have to say anything to this,

408
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,265
but I mean if my watch
is found with the body

409
00:23:46,415 --> 00:23:48,087
I'm gonna be completely implicated.

410
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:50,316
Which, um...

411
00:23:50,615 --> 00:23:52,421
That's fine, I mean, I did it.

412
00:23:52,571 --> 00:23:54,642
But I'm not gonna do anything
to drag you into it.

413
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:55,833
I promise.

414
00:23:55,983 --> 00:23:58,003
I'll do everything in my power

415
00:23:58,153 --> 00:24:00,448
to keep you out of it.
Keep you safe.

416
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:04,096
I just wanted to say.

417
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:08,608
Well, I just figured I could always
kill you to keep you silent.

418
00:24:08,758 --> 00:24:09,758
That was creepy.

419
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:20,165
- Hi.
- Tim.

420
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,206
What are you... Get out of my room.
Who let you in?

421
00:24:23,357 --> 00:24:25,666
- Little Garrity. Two minutes.
- Get out!

422
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:27,525
What are you doing here?

423
00:24:27,854 --> 00:24:30,588
Two minutes. That's all I'm asking.

424
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,430
That's it.

425
00:24:33,477 --> 00:24:35,535
Okay, two minutes. It's late, Tim.

426
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:40,473
Something happened to me
last night that...

427
00:24:40,735 --> 00:24:43,503
I have no idea what it was,
but I felt something.

428
00:24:44,954 --> 00:24:45,954
Okay.

429
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:50,413
I felt something so strong
that it made me wonder

430
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:55,367
about everything you've been saying
isn't as crazy as what everyone thought.

431
00:24:57,545 --> 00:24:59,650
And it's hard for me
to understand the feeling.

432
00:25:00,572 --> 00:25:01,922
Listen, it's okay.

433
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:05,915
It's kind of embarrassing.

434
00:25:06,177 --> 00:25:07,177
It's okay.

435
00:25:08,003 --> 00:25:10,487
It allowed me to feel part of something,

436
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,530
part of the people,

437
00:25:14,783 --> 00:25:15,783
part of you,

438
00:25:16,635 --> 00:25:17,635
part of God.

439
00:25:20,742 --> 00:25:22,192
Even saying that

440
00:25:23,996 --> 00:25:24,996
is scary.

441
00:25:32,654 --> 00:25:34,835
- Did you feel it?
- Yeah, I felt it.

442
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:37,414
I always feel it.

443
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,496
Sorry.

444
00:25:45,987 --> 00:25:47,001
What are you doing?

445
00:25:49,434 --> 00:25:50,434
I don't know.

446
00:25:51,094 --> 00:25:52,513
I don't know what I'm doing, Lyla.

447
00:25:52,663 --> 00:25:54,713
I guess I feel closer to God
if I'm with you.

448
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:58,509
You feel closer to God
when you're with me?

449
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:00,115
I'm sorry.

450
00:26:01,816 --> 00:26:03,848
Did you think that line
was gonna work on me?

451
00:26:05,142 --> 00:26:06,142
It's not a line.

452
00:26:06,404 --> 00:26:07,476
Get out.

453
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:09,875
Go!

454
00:26:21,676 --> 00:26:23,247
The team is screwed.

455
00:26:23,397 --> 00:26:25,369
It's screwed. There's no leadership.

456
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,951
And it's all because of McGregor.

457
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:31,521
There's something wrong with that guy.
He's mean. I think he's evil.

458
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:34,120
You're just pissed off
'cause he kicked you off the field

459
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,108
and took the barbecue
out of the dealership?

460
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,475
I hate his guts,
but that's not the reason.

461
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,575
Well, just out of curiosity,

462
00:26:41,576 --> 00:26:43,929
what is the reason
that I am here right now?

463
00:26:44,591 --> 00:26:45,873
What if I told you

464
00:26:48,397 --> 00:26:50,262
that I could make him go away

465
00:26:50,451 --> 00:26:52,106
and you could have your job back?

466
00:26:52,256 --> 00:26:53,806
I'd say you're crazy.

467
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:55,622
I'd say you're crazy and I got a job.

468
00:26:55,911 --> 00:27:00,055
I'm not gonna get rid of the guy
unless I know that you will come back.

469
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:01,470
What are you, crazy?

470
00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:04,142
You got anything else?
'Cause I'm getting ready to scoot.

471
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:05,646
- I got something...
- Go ahead.

472
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,374
- I got something.
- Throw it at me.

473
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:10,325
I've seen Tami, I've seen Julie.

474
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:14,793
Tami's trying to be so brave
and so strong without her husband here.

475
00:27:15,738 --> 00:27:17,297
And I see how sad she is.

476
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:18,896
I see Julie walking around

477
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:20,495
in things she shouldn't be wearing,

478
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:23,013
hanging out with kids
she shouldn't be hanging out with.

479
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:26,521
And you know that little baby Gracie
misses her daddy, you know it.

480
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:28,065
First year of her life

481
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:29,725
she never sees her daddy.

482
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:32,361
Your family needs you.

483
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:33,898
They Miss you.

484
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:36,148
And I know you miss your family.

485
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:39,063
So I want you to think
about this for one minute.

486
00:27:39,732 --> 00:27:41,882
If you could just go back in time

487
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:44,907
and make the TMU job go away,

488
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:47,944
and be the coach of the Panthers again,

489
00:27:48,094 --> 00:27:49,094
would you do it?

490
00:27:56,222 --> 00:27:57,976
Jules, this is your mother.

491
00:27:58,126 --> 00:27:59,428
It's past 2:00 in the morning,

492
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:02,328
and you had best call me
as fast as you can.

493
00:28:03,604 --> 00:28:07,206
I don't wanna beat a dead horse, but
let's go over it again. Vampires, real.

494
00:28:07,356 --> 00:28:08,993
- Moon isn't real.
- The moon isn't?

495
00:28:09,143 --> 00:28:10,399
No, the landing wasn't real.

496
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:11,803
No, the moon isn't real, Dylan.

497
00:28:11,953 --> 00:28:13,497
Dinosaur in the congo.

498
00:28:13,647 --> 00:28:15,067
One world government

499
00:28:15,217 --> 00:28:17,815
and Al Gore is the commissar
of the whole thing.

500
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,669
Or the one where Al Gore is a robot.

501
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:21,944
So is your mother.

502
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,035
Ipods have a mind of their own

503
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:27,887
and they will actually take us all over

504
00:28:28,037 --> 00:28:29,686
in a short amount of weeks.

505
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:32,523
- Hyperbolic... Time savers.
- Nanotechnology.

506
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:34,373
Nanotechnology. Good one!

507
00:28:35,189 --> 00:28:37,590
And then there's the whole
global warming issue

508
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,253
which is some big giant
diabolical illusion

509
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:41,588
created by the EPA

510
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,557
who are out there strangling polar bears

511
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:45,257
with their bare hands.

512
00:28:45,705 --> 00:28:47,555
Ooh, strangling polar bears!

513
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,760
Nice.

514
00:29:12,498 --> 00:29:13,787
Get in the house right now!

515
00:29:16,106 --> 00:29:18,273
Get in the house right now, Julie!

516
00:29:18,596 --> 00:29:20,344
- You should go...
- I'm not going in.

517
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:21,795
Take me somewhere.

518
00:29:22,224 --> 00:29:24,529
I can't take you anywhere.
That's kidnapping.

519
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,966
I don't care. Take me somewhere.

520
00:29:26,763 --> 00:29:27,951
Get in there right now!

521
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:28,969
I'm not going in.

522
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,184
I'm not going in! What's wrong with you?

523
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:35,395
- Get out!
- Have you totally lost it?

524
00:29:35,545 --> 00:29:36,936
I'm not getting out!

525
00:29:37,087 --> 00:29:38,937
What the hell are you doing?

526
00:29:40,382 --> 00:29:42,202
I am your mother, all right?

527
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:43,841
And you have not grown up yet!

528
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,486
And you are not rid of me yet.

529
00:29:45,847 --> 00:29:47,151
Go to hell!

530
00:29:53,101 --> 00:29:54,113
You got rid of me

531
00:29:54,263 --> 00:29:56,163
when you had Gracie and dad left!

532
00:29:57,373 --> 00:29:58,381
You know what?

533
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:00,225
You need to learn to live with that.

534
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,370
Hi, welcome to Applebee's.
What can I get for you?

535
00:30:14,965 --> 00:30:17,315
I'm gonna have the quesadilla burger

536
00:30:18,224 --> 00:30:19,224
and an iced tea.

537
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,462
- All right.
- So tell me something.

538
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,426
Are you and my son dating?

539
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:26,879
I... I, um...

540
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:32,061
Well, I... I don't know actually.

541
00:30:32,211 --> 00:30:33,367
'Cause I have to tell you,

542
00:30:34,503 --> 00:30:36,161
uh, I really don't get it.

543
00:30:36,605 --> 00:30:38,511
I mean, no disrespect intended.

544
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:40,211
But, uh, as a parent,

545
00:30:41,011 --> 00:30:42,517
I just don't understand it.

546
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:44,620
I mean, you could date pretty much

547
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,220
anyone you want to.

548
00:30:46,418 --> 00:30:48,215
What do you want with my kid Landry?

549
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,832
Landry... He's, um...

550
00:30:55,636 --> 00:30:56,932
He's wonderful guy.

551
00:30:57,736 --> 00:30:59,186
He's smart and kind.

552
00:31:00,353 --> 00:31:01,353
And he's caring.

553
00:31:02,098 --> 00:31:04,848
He's funny and he's really nice
to be around.

554
00:31:07,557 --> 00:31:10,076
But you should know that,
being his father and all.

555
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:11,280
I appreciate that.

556
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:13,582
You want that burger
medium or well-done?

557
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,159
Medium's fine.

558
00:31:18,674 --> 00:31:19,674
Thank you.

559
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,217
<i>Friday night at last.
Friday night at last.</i>

560
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:24,626
<i>Thank God almighty.</i>

561
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:25,961
<i>It's Friday night at last.</i>

562
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:29,067
<i>A whole new season, a new coach.</i>

563
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:32,017
<i>And maybe a whole new era
for Panther football.</i>

564
00:31:33,522 --> 00:31:35,412
<i>This team has been
to the top of the mountain.</i>

565
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:37,930
<i>And we all know the higher the mountain,</i>

566
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,389
<i>the harder the fall.</i>

567
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,728
<i>Let's look for coach McGregor to give
the ball to his big bright shining star,</i>

568
00:31:43,463 --> 00:31:45,113
<i>Brian "Smash" Williams.</i>

569
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,601
<i>Coach McGregor has made it clear</i>

570
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:49,972
<i>that Smash Williams will
be getting busy tonight.</i>

571
00:31:50,664 --> 00:31:52,109
Bring on the Smash.

572
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:53,405
Bring on the Smash.

573
00:31:53,722 --> 00:31:55,468
He's pretty, he's fast.

574
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:58,068
Keep that going! Keep that going, baby!

575
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:06,512
<i>One thing's for sure,</i>

576
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:08,845
<i>coach McGregor should
be starting his regime</i>

577
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,050
<i>with a victory tonight.</i>

578
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,802
<i>Even though there're rumblings
of dissension in the locker room,</i>

579
00:32:12,952 --> 00:32:15,503
<i>hopefully it won't make its way
onto the field.</i>

580
00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:17,759
<i>It's a big high bomber.</i>

581
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:20,065
<i>The rivals take it deep
in their own end zone.</i>

582
00:32:20,277 --> 00:32:21,361
<i>He's out the five.</i>

583
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:23,352
<i>He breaks right...
Oh, great move inside!</i>

584
00:32:23,614 --> 00:32:25,563
<i>He comes to the edge</i>
<i>of the 40, the 50...</i>

585
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:26,865
<i>He's crossing midfield!</i>

586
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:28,635
<i>Oh, my, and down he goes</i>

587
00:32:28,785 --> 00:32:30,025
<i>at the Panther 40!</i>

588
00:32:30,771 --> 00:32:31,771
<i>Mercy me, folks.</i>

589
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:33,828
<i>Expectations are sky-high</i>

590
00:32:33,979 --> 00:32:35,036
<i>here in Dillon.</i>

591
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,448
<i>And if McGregor expects to walk</i>

592
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,825
<i>in the boots of the great Eric Taylor,</i>

593
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:40,744
<i>he better get a hold of this game quick.</i>

594
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:42,913
<i>'cause these Rattlers have come to play.</i>

595
00:32:44,055 --> 00:32:45,055
Black... 53!

596
00:32:46,637 --> 00:32:47,437
Hike!

597
00:32:48,464 --> 00:32:49,918
<i>Pitch to williams up the middle.</i>

598
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,672
<i>Oh, williams is just...</i>

599
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:53,966
<i>The Panthers are on their way.</i>

600
00:32:54,228 --> 00:32:56,718
Hey coach, I think we got
to freeze those linebackers.

601
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,661
Maybe they'll play
next to the tight end.

602
00:32:58,783 --> 00:33:00,191
Not right now, okay! Not right now!

603
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:02,190
Right now just let me coach, all right?

604
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:03,463
Come on out!

605
00:33:04,992 --> 00:33:06,412
<i>Saracen opens left,</i>

606
00:33:06,562 --> 00:33:08,822
<i>pitches to Smash...
Oh no, it's on the carpet!</i>

607
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,034
<i>Williams picks it up.</i>

608
00:33:10,143 --> 00:33:11,408
<i>He's got nowhere to go.</i>

609
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:13,773
<i>Second and 19.</i>

610
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,693
No! Come on, now!

611
00:33:15,843 --> 00:33:16,784
Hut!

612
00:33:16,983 --> 00:33:19,041
<i>Saracen goes left!
He's got Williams in flat.</i>

613
00:33:20,697 --> 00:33:21,709
<i>Oh, interception!</i>

614
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:23,161
<i>Smash takes him down. Oh my!</i>

615
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,913
What the hell was that?

616
00:33:26,063 --> 00:33:27,110
What the hell was that?

617
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,412
I lost it, all right?

618
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:29,715
Put the ball in my hands!

619
00:33:29,865 --> 00:33:32,421
- It got away from me.
- Just put the ball in my hands, Matty!

620
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:36,582
You guys make it work!
I want to see you work out there.

621
00:33:36,732 --> 00:33:38,810
Come on, get your head
back in the game, baby.

622
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,138
It'll be there.

623
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:42,565
- Come on, man, we can do this.
- I'm right here.

624
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:44,808
Let's go ahead and do something then!

625
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:46,283
Come on, D!

626
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:47,797
Next time we get the ball,

627
00:33:47,947 --> 00:33:49,818
I think it's time
to go against the grain.

628
00:33:49,968 --> 00:33:51,507
Play action to a wide-receiver...

629
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:54,380
We got a situation right now.
And we're on C, all right?

630
00:33:54,444 --> 00:33:55,444
I understand that.

631
00:33:55,706 --> 00:33:57,351
I don't have time to take advice

632
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:59,050
from the team mascot, all right?

633
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,301
I'm a little busy.

634
00:34:00,451 --> 00:34:01,451
Come on now!

635
00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:03,409
I'm talking to you, 50 Joe!

636
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,611
50 Joe, come on! It's on you!

637
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:07,942
<i>Late in the fourth quarter,</i>
<i>Gridlocked at zeros,</i>

638
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:09,547
<i>the Panther blow out did not happen.</i>

639
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:11,385
<i>And now it's gut check time.</i>

640
00:34:13,305 --> 00:34:14,386
<i>Saracen opens left.</i>

641
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:15,847
<i>Oh, it'a a busted play.</i>

642
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,521
No!

643
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:20,593
<i>Down goes Saracen.</i>

644
00:34:23,817 --> 00:34:25,557
<i>McGregor looks very unhappy.</i>

645
00:34:26,377 --> 00:34:28,644
<i>He's pulling Smash Williams
over to the sideline.</i>

646
00:34:29,162 --> 00:34:31,582
<i>Looks like he's giving Smash the play.</i>

647
00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:32,732
<i>Here we go.</i>

648
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,320
What's the play?

649
00:34:34,286 --> 00:34:35,359
190-24 arrow.

650
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,690
<i>Panthers in shotgun.</i>

651
00:34:45,287 --> 00:34:46,870
<i>Oh, it's a direct snap to williams.</i>

652
00:34:49,384 --> 00:34:50,751
<i>Powers up the middle.</i>

653
00:34:53,294 --> 00:34:54,294
<i>He breaks the tacklew.</i>

654
00:34:55,505 --> 00:34:56,505
<i>Touchdown!</i>

655
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:59,611
<i>Smash Williams has carried
this team on his back</i>

656
00:34:59,771 --> 00:35:02,269
<i>and he has brought home
the "w" for Dillon.</i>

657
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:04,646
<i>You know, I think coach McGregor</i>

658
00:35:04,796 --> 00:35:06,826
<i>might've made
a big statement right there.</i>

659
00:35:06,976 --> 00:35:09,336
<i>Saracen was out of the play completely.</i>

660
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:10,732
<i>Used him as a decoy.</i>

661
00:35:10,882 --> 00:35:13,146
<i>Looks like he just rewired his offense.</i>

662
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
What's up!

663
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,112
Aw, what's up!

664
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:18,274
What's up!

665
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:22,361
<i>Smash Williams
is the Dillon Panther offense.</i>

666
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:23,942
Next time, Matty.

667
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:25,959
You gonna get yours next time.

668
00:35:40,852 --> 00:35:42,579
Get off me! Get off of me!

669
00:35:43,443 --> 00:35:45,429
You want some? You can get it!

670
00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:47,848
You want some? Come on!

671
00:35:48,406 --> 00:35:49,856
Lost your mind, man!

672
00:35:50,185 --> 00:35:51,685
What's wrong with you?

673
00:35:54,741 --> 00:35:56,106
Get your hands off me!

674
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:59,016
What's wrong with y'all!

675
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:01,267
Take him inside.

676
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,719
- Hi.
- Hi.

677
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:22,149
Don't trip over the laundry.

678
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,360
Did you see the game tonight?

679
00:36:34,014 --> 00:36:36,104
Did you hear what happened
at the game tonight?

680
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:43,277
I hit Julie last night.

681
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,980
Right across the face. I slapped her.

682
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:59,718
I think I'm completely losing it.

683
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:04,867
I don't know what's happening
with our family.

684
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:06,971
All right.

685
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:28,480
You could've knocked, Six.

686
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:30,236
I came here to tell you something.

687
00:37:30,635 --> 00:37:32,721
It's the only reason I'm here.
And to put an end

688
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:35,391
to this so-called friendship
that we got.

689
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,551
I quit the team tonight.

690
00:37:36,843 --> 00:37:38,530
I didn't want you
to think for one second

691
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,086
it had anything to do with you
telling me I suck as a coach

692
00:37:41,348 --> 00:37:43,078
'cause "A", I don't care what you think.

693
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:44,736
And "B", I don't suck.

694
00:37:45,245 --> 00:37:46,795
I'm an awesome coach.

695
00:37:46,993 --> 00:37:47,997
Just with McGregor around

696
00:37:48,147 --> 00:37:50,076
there's not a whole hell
of a lot for me to do.

697
00:37:50,245 --> 00:37:52,504
That's good, 'cause I got
more important things to do.

698
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:53,757
I'm going to Mexico.

699
00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:54,924
I'm gonna have surgery.

700
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,116
I'll probably be walking
next time you see me.

701
00:37:57,266 --> 00:38:00,819
and the first thing I'm gonna do is
walk over here so I could kick your ass.

702
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:03,441
'Cause you are the worst
and stupidest friend

703
00:38:03,703 --> 00:38:05,777
that a guy could ever have
in this world.

704
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:08,893
Pretty much hate your guts right now.
I'm so disgusted in you.

705
00:38:09,222 --> 00:38:10,240
I'm disappointed.

706
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:16,044
Mexico, huh?

707
00:38:26,308 --> 00:38:27,308
Hi!

708
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,818
Jeez, what are you... You okay?

709
00:38:29,968 --> 00:38:31,518
Yeah, no... I'm good.

710
00:38:34,783 --> 00:38:35,838
- Well...
- You okay?

711
00:38:35,988 --> 00:38:37,479
Yeah, no... I just...

712
00:38:42,951 --> 00:38:45,264
- Tyra, look... We don't have...
- You know what?

713
00:38:46,348 --> 00:38:47,998
Just... Just be quiet.

714
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:58,127
No one's ever cared for me so much.

715
00:39:11,347 --> 00:39:12,347
Here.

716
00:39:12,848 --> 00:39:13,818
No.

717
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:15,836
- Put it away.
- We're going to Mexico.

718
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,854
- What do you mean, put it away?
- We're still in Texas, idiot.

719
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:21,216
We got a map?

720
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:22,708
Yes, I have a map.

721
00:39:23,283 --> 00:39:25,231
Well, what are you waiting for?
Let's go.

722
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,037
Hi.

723
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:41,235
There's some food on the stove.

724
00:39:41,385 --> 00:39:42,540
I'm not really hungry.

725
00:39:42,943 --> 00:39:44,242
You look like hell.

726
00:39:44,392 --> 00:39:45,392
Thanks.

727
00:39:48,045 --> 00:39:50,495
I think I did something to my shoulder.

728
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,906
Sit down. Let me look at it.

729
00:39:53,107 --> 00:39:54,427
It's not that bad.

730
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:55,956
Sit down.

731
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,454
- You sure you know...
- Yeah. Sit down!

732
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:01,267
'Cause, you know,
you're not a nurse yet.

733
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:03,061
- Shut up.
- You're still in sch...

734
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,630
Turn.

735
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,430
- Here?
- Yeah.

736
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,590
Here?

737
00:40:07,843 --> 00:40:08,843
- Here.
- Yeah.

738
00:40:13,154 --> 00:40:14,154
Better?

739
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:16,819
Yeah, a little bit.

740
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:38,202
What... What is that?

741
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,950
A song my mom sang
to us when we got hurt.

742
00:40:42,361 --> 00:40:45,061
It's hard to translate
because it's nonsense.

743
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:47,263
Something about a frog

744
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:49,567
and a butt and a saint.

745
00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:52,278
Seriously.

746
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,319
That's funny.

747
00:40:54,072 --> 00:40:55,283
Point of it is, however,

748
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:57,673
that if things are not good today,

749
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,031
they will be better tomorrow.

750
00:41:03,084 --> 00:41:04,634
Things will be better.

751
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:28,695
Yes!

752
00:41:36,802 --> 00:41:38,452
We gonna rock and roll?

753
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:45,767
I sure as hell hope I don't regret this.

754
00:41:46,566 --> 00:41:47,566
No way.

755
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:49,171
Let's go in.

756
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:52,375
You got a drink?

757
00:41:52,525 --> 00:41:53,525
Yes, I do.

758
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,064
Yes, I do.
