1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,909
Hey, Buddy!

2
00:00:01,425 --> 00:00:02,065
Oh! God!

3
00:00:02,385 --> 00:00:03,583
Lyin' son of a bitch!

4
00:00:03,686 --> 00:00:04,997
I think you need
to worry about your family.

5
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:06,019
Pam will forgive me.

6
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,115
I was taking some medication
for a while

7
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:09,767
and now I'm off of it.

8
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,349
I feel better
than I've ever felt.

9
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:14,104
Waverly?

10
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:16,530
I'd like to talk to you
about your academic future.

11
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:17,941
What am I,
your next project?

12
00:00:18,113 --> 00:00:19,068
Absolutely.

13
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:22,129
The athletic director over
at TMU called this afternoon

14
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:23,601
to talk about the future.

15
00:00:23,728 --> 00:00:26,740
You have been invited
to training camp in Austin.

16
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:27,620
No way!

17
00:00:27,676 --> 00:00:29,561
What is that?
You have a tattoo?

18
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:31,451
I'm, uh, Suzy.
I did the tattoo.

19
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:32,500
I'm his fiancée.

20
00:00:32,678 --> 00:00:33,413
I'm Bo Miller.

21
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:34,800
I'm your new
next-door neighbor.

22
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:35,941
He's a funny kid.

23
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:37,692
I'm sure you've got
your hands full.

24
00:00:37,925 --> 00:00:39,900
Your rain gutter's
falling off, huh?

25
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:40,560
Yeah.

26
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:43,051
That's on my long list
of things to do.

27
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:45,140
- I love you.
- I love you too.

28
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,503
TMU made the offer.

29
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:49,750
Three bedroom.

30
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,553
- Charming, turn-of-the-century.
- Turn of what century?

31
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,920
Ooh.
Original floors.

32
00:00:56,328 --> 00:00:57,931
- It needs a little work.
- Sounds like a money pit.

33
00:00:57,978 --> 00:00:58,812
I think that sounds
like fun.

34
00:00:58,925 --> 00:00:59,812
If we're doing this,

35
00:00:59,818 --> 00:01:01,040
we're gonna have to plan
a trip to Austin soon.

36
00:01:01,065 --> 00:01:01,950
We're gonna have
to get a broker.

37
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:03,471
We're gonna have to put
our house on the market.

38
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:04,871
I need to look for a job.

39
00:01:05,445 --> 00:01:06,461
Hey, honey.
How are you doing?

40
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:08,762
Who's looking for a job?

41
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:13,483
We're moving again,
aren't we?

42
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:16,533
Honey, your father
was offered

43
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:18,182
an amazing job

44
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:20,160
at TMU in Austin.

45
00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:21,981
Well, that's good, that's
good. Because guess what.

46
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:22,902
I'm not going.

47
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:24,432
I'm really--
I'm not going.

48
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:25,611
But have fun in Austin.

49
00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:26,801
This is really important. You
can't mention this to anyone,

50
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:28,322
especially Matt Saracen.
Do you understand me?

51
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:28,691
Sure.

52
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:31,040
I'll just tell him I'll be
living by myself from now on.

53
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:33,161
Honey...listen.

54
00:01:33,198 --> 00:01:34,220
Hey, don't walk out
the door.

55
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:35,423
Hey, I need you
to try on your dress

56
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,663
for the father-daughter dance.

57
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,510
The one that
I will not be attending?

58
00:01:38,638 --> 00:01:40,422
Come back here right now, girl!

59
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:41,562
What are you doing?

60
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:43,470
Go, go!

61
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:45,301
Yes!

62
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,111
Good job, Street!
Good job, good job!

63
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:50,073
Hey, Street.
Nice job, baby!

64
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:53,740
Somebody's gotta show me
something.

65
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:00,541
That's what
I'm talking about, baby.

66
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,461
Somebody show me something,
please.

67
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:03,420
Come on, Herc!

68
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:09,423
Nice job, Street.

69
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:11,283
Nice job, golden boy.

70
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:12,060
Thanks, Coach.

71
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:13,301
What are you sitting
around for?

72
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:14,651
What do you think
we're gonna do, make out?

73
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:15,981
No, Coach.
No, Coach.

74
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:18,543
Does anybody wanna go
to Beijing?

75
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:19,900
Anybody at all?

76
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:21,202
Let's go, boys.
Let's go.

77
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:27,061
You looked great out there, son.

78
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:28,583
Thank you.

79
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:30,023
You seemed to have
the whole package

80
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:30,970
working for you today.

81
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,801
You were passing
and catching, and...

82
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:35,241
handling the chair like
I've never seen you do it before.

83
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,352
Very impressive.

84
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:37,820
Thank you so much.
I, I--

85
00:02:37,877 --> 00:02:40,030
You guys have really helped me
over the past couple of weeks.

86
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:41,283
I don't know how
to say thank you.

87
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:42,982
It's just been--
It's just been amazing.

88
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:43,991
I've really enjoyed it.

89
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:46,732
You don't have to thank us, son.
That's our job.

90
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:49,181
It's also our job
to tell you that...

91
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:51,442
we're not gonna be taking you
to Beijing this time.

92
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:54,122
Come see me
in four years.

00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:01,250
Jason!

98
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:02,523
- Hi.
- Hi, Suzy.

99
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:03,771
I heard.

100
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:04,942
I'm so sorry.

101
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:06,632
Sorry.

102
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,223
There he is!

103
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:10,101
What's crackin', man?

104
00:04:10,645 --> 00:04:12,012
Hey, rub some dirt on it.

105
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:12,791
Walk it off.

106
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:14,652
Thanks for the sympathy.

107
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:16,273
Whoa-ho-ho!

108
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:17,313
Depressing guy.

109
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:19,082
I'm trying
to get my groove on here.

110
00:04:19,436 --> 00:04:21,433
Look, you did great.

111
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:23,932
Coach Gumbie loves you!

112
00:04:24,085 --> 00:04:24,892
All right?

113
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:26,432
What's the big deal?

114
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:27,873
The big deal is
I was the best athlete

115
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:29,060
out there on that floor

116
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:30,210
over these past couple of weeks.

117
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,632
You know it, I know it,

118
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:32,723
Coach Gumbie knows it.

119
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:35,043
But he don't love me that much.
I'm not one of his boys.

120
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:36,400
He's got relationships
with you.

121
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:38,521
No way he's gonna
pass you guys up for me.

122
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:39,922
Wow!

123
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:41,770
You have a truly

124
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:43,782
spectacular ego.
You know that?

125
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:44,550
Herc, shut up!

126
00:04:44,678 --> 00:04:46,211
Listen to me here.
All right, stud?

127
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:47,010
You're good.

128
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:50,071
You may have
the best raw skills out there.

129
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:51,872
But hold off
on the conspiracy theories.

130
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:53,040
You ain't on the team

131
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:55,093
because you're not comfortable
in a chair yet.

132
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:57,193
And that's gonna take years.

133
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,262
I really needed this.

134
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:06,050
Look.

135
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:08,250
I know you did.

136
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,261
We all did.

137
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,212
It's the championship, QB.

138
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:16,222
Not therapy.

139
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:23,451
You know,
Herc's right.

140
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:26,181
I was a complete ass
earlier.

141
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:27,751
So was he!

142
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:29,051
Yeah, but that's just Herc.

143
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:31,620
It's not me though,
and I'm sorry.

144
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:33,061
I'm just a little bit, uh--

145
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,768
Yeah, disappointed?

146
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:36,469
Yeah.

147
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,780
That's putting it lightly.

148
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:40,170
I'm sorry.

149
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:42,830
It's okay.
I'll get over it.

150
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,723
You know the sad thing
is that he's my ride home.

151
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:48,390
So for the next week,
I just get to sit up here

152
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:50,153
while he scrimmages
and parties.

153
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:51,162
That sucks.

154
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:52,103
Yeah.

155
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:53,780
Just a little bit.

156
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:56,780
Um...

157
00:05:57,868 --> 00:05:59,183
listen. There's this

158
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:00,950
refrigerator

159
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:03,090
that I've been needing
to drop off

160
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:04,733
in, uh, Barton

161
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:05,820
near my sister's place.

162
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:07,513
- Oh, Barton.
- Yeah, it's right by Dillon.

163
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:10,693
So I could give you a ride.

164
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,371
Yeah.

165
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:17,593
Oh, I mean,

166
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:19,341
I don't have to if--

167
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:21,521
- No, no, I think, uh--
- If you wanna stay--

168
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:22,771
I think
it's a great idea.

169
00:06:23,126 --> 00:06:24,251
I really do.

170
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,400
I can give you some
gas money or...

171
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:27,753
something.

172
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:30,550
All right.

173
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:38,961
Yeah?

174
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:42,252
Hi.

175
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:44,090
Did you clean
rain gutters?

176
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,720
Yeah, not a big deal.

177
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:47,090
Tim, in the future,
could you please

178
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:48,793
not clean my rain gutters?
Please?

179
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:49,930
Okay?

180
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:50,770
Mm-hmm.

181
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,333
Because if I want
my rain gutters cleaned,

182
00:06:52,435 --> 00:06:53,853
then I'll do it
or I'll call somebody to do it.

183
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:54,883
But I don't need you
to do it.

184
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:56,091
So...great.

185
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,070
Now, I have a one-time,

186
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:00,890
today-only favor
that I have to ask, okay?

187
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:01,962
My work just called

188
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:03,340
and they need me
to work the later shift.

189
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:04,382
And I don't have anybody

190
00:07:04,435 --> 00:07:04,900
to pick up Bo.

191
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:05,631
And they shouldn't do that

192
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,790
because they know
I'm a single mom

193
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:07,551
and I don't have anybody.

194
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,762
- I can't afford to...say no.
- No problem.

195
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:10,890
Really?

196
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:12,090
I'll pick him up.

197
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:13,793
Okay, listen.
I'll give you the key to my house.

198
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:16,003
And, um,
and I'll pay you.

199
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:17,721
I'm not a babysitter.

200
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:19,642
I just explained to you that

201
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:22,002
I don't wanna have
that kind of issue.

202
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:23,340
All right, he gets out

203
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:24,902
of school at 3:00.

204
00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:27,211
Please don't be late.
He has trust issues, all right?

205
00:07:28,606 --> 00:07:29,080
All right.

206
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:30,281
Bye.

207
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,230
Mrs. T.,
you gotta be kidding me.

208
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:34,541
Oh, no, sweetheart.
I'm serious as a heart attack.

209
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:35,581
Tutoring,

210
00:07:35,657 --> 00:07:37,191
Independent Studies,
extra class.

211
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:38,821
Where's my free periods?

212
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:39,953
This is very aggressive.

213
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:40,963
That's the way we do.

214
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:41,813
I have a job.

215
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,351
I know, honey.
You've mentioned that

216
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:44,040
several times.

217
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:45,360
And as I've told you,

218
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:47,641
I would be more than happy
to help you manage your time

219
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:48,323
in the afternoon--

220
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:49,351
You get a nice little kick

221
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:50,723
out of the fact
that you can bust my chops,

222
00:07:50,748 --> 00:07:51,283
don't you?

223
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:52,752
The way I see it is this.

224
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:54,513
I see if you
turn yourself around,

225
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,802
you could get
into junior college,

226
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,603
kick ass there,
and then go transfer

227
00:07:57,655 --> 00:07:59,400
to a full four-year college.

228
00:07:59,677 --> 00:08:00,862
I see all that
for you.

229
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:03,241
That's completely unrealistic,
Mrs. Taylor.

230
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:04,553
Do you understand?

231
00:08:04,587 --> 00:08:05,940
My mom didn't go
to college.

232
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:07,862
My sister barely got
her GED.

233
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:11,322
Nobody in my family has gone
past high school, if that.

234
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:14,491
What, you think I could be
any different?

235
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:15,082
Really?

236
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:16,203
I do.

237
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:18,861
And I think that
you should too.

238
00:08:22,977 --> 00:08:26,920
So basically they diagnosed me
with a bipolar disorder.

239
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:28,462
A bipolar disorder?

240
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:29,880
Yeah.

241
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:33,862
So last year,
when you was in Africa,

242
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:35,821
- I mean, how did that--
- No. I wasn't in Africa.

243
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:38,591
I was...

244
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:41,823
staying by my aunt's place
in Dallas.

245
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,483
They put me in this, like,

246
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:47,813
outreach program
at St. Vincent's Hospital.

247
00:08:48,877 --> 00:08:50,540
So that means--

248
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,992
what does that mean?

249
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:55,693
It just means
I get these mood swings.

250
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:56,903
But they're, like,

251
00:08:58,046 --> 00:08:58,820
extreme.

252
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,202
You know, to, like,
the tenth power.

253
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,991
It could be dangerous
sometimes. I mean,

254
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,071
people get
really depressed,

255
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:09,593
um, even suicidal, and...

256
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:12,300
Wow.

257
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:16,241
If you could see
your terrified face right now--

258
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:17,280
No, no.

259
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,592
I just need time to digest,
that's all.

260
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:28,420
This is gonna be fantastic.

261
00:09:28,597 --> 00:09:30,002
Um, where's that picture--

262
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:32,421
All of us were burying
each other in the sand.

263
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:34,723
Tami and little Buddy, Jr.
and your mom and I.

264
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,701
Those were the good old days,
weren't they?

265
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:42,521
This is gonna be great.

266
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:44,151
Dad, are you sure

267
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:45,531
that this is the right

268
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:47,091
thing?

269
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:48,773
I mean, photo outlining?

270
00:09:48,826 --> 00:09:50,511
Yeah...I do.

271
00:09:50,786 --> 00:09:52,700
Honey,
I saw this on Dr. Phil.

272
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:53,921
And your mom,

273
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:56,702
when she sees this,
she is just gonna melt,

274
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:58,730
especially when she sees that,
you know,

275
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:00,171
you and I did this together

276
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:02,693
- and put this thing together.
- Yeah, I don't--

277
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:04,823
I don't know
if I wanna be taking sides.

278
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:08,741
I--

279
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:11,650
You're not taking sides.

280
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:13,553
Don't you think

281
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:16,252
maybe she deserves
a little more time?

282
00:10:16,577 --> 00:10:17,672
Lyla, I can't.

283
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:19,191
I can't.

284
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:22,440
I can't stay here any longer
by myself in this place.

285
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25,910
I can't live
without my family.

286
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:29,413
Tell you the truth, Lyla,
I, uh,

287
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:32,681
I got no reason to live
without my family.

288
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:36,891
Why'd you do it?

289
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:40,222
Why didn't you think about it,
Dad?

290
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:42,010
Lyla,
your dad's a sinner.

291
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,481
I'm a weak man.

292
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:46,861
But it was one mistake.

293
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,493
I swear, Lyla,

294
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:51,760
I will never ever

295
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:54,840
do anything to hurt
this family again, honey.

296
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:57,381
I swear.

297
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:03,530
Guys, stop!

298
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:04,841
I'm gonna kick your butt!

299
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:06,491
Yeah, whatever!

300
00:11:06,545 --> 00:11:07,902
- Yeah, right.
- Mickey Mouse!

301
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:09,082
Pip-squeak.

302
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:10,350
You gonna cry or something

303
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:11,750
'cause she's not here.

304
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:12,441
Hey!

305
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:15,562
What do you think
you're doing?

306
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:17,421
- We were just playing with him.
- Yeah?

307
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:18,673
You okay?

308
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:20,181
Yeah, I think so.

309
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,302
You were just playing
with him?

310
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:22,601
Four on one.
Double his size.

311
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:23,533
Is that playing
with him?

312
00:11:23,575 --> 00:11:23,950
Yeah.

313
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:25,083
It is, isn't it?

314
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:27,081
If I ever so much see you look

315
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:28,231
at this kid the wrong way

316
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:29,081
I'm gonna find you,

317
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:30,343
I'm gonna punch a hole
in your chest

318
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,290
and rip your heart out.

319
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:32,500
Are we clear?

320
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:33,321
- Yeah.
- You sure?!

321
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:34,752
- Yeah.
- Now get outta here.

322
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:40,252
You okay?

323
00:11:40,726 --> 00:11:41,661
- I think so.
- You sure?

324
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:43,812
I'm sorry I'm late, bro.

325
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:44,803
Are you kidding?

326
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:45,662
That rocked.

327
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:47,273
That happen
all the time?

328
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:48,670
Every day.

329
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:50,150
Yeah.

330
00:11:50,237 --> 00:11:51,540
I can't believe Tim Riggins

331
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:52,910
is picking me up from school!

332
00:11:59,247 --> 00:12:01,202
Fact the matter is
we did think about you.

333
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:05,052
Austin's a--
You know,

334
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:06,733
it's an arty kinda town.
You're arty.

335
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:09,402
It's arty.
It's a good match.

336
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:11,713
And there's a lot of culture
in Austin.

337
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:13,522
There's a lot of dance.
You love dance.

338
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:15,801
There's a hell of a lot
of dance.

339
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:17,513
There's dancing all
over Austin.

340
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:20,090
There's an Austin dance troupe.
Tell her.

341
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:22,151
Tell her about all of it.

342
00:12:22,687 --> 00:12:24,962
There are lots of different
kinds of dancing, honey.

343
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:26,963
and they've got
a beautiful ballet.

344
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:28,942
No, they've got
an excellent ballet there

345
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:29,540
is what they got.

346
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:31,953
They got some
top-notch "ballet-ers."

347
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:37,801
Oh, the look.

348
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:39,060
That's a great look.

349
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:40,770
Fine.
There is no problem.

350
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:42,601
You're done.
That's the way you wanna do it?

351
00:12:42,676 --> 00:12:43,353
That's great.

352
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:46,551
You have nothing
to worry about...

353
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:47,251
here.

354
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:48,261
Trust me.

355
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:49,690
Landry's actually right.

356
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:51,010
No, he's not right.

357
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:53,113
I can't step up
against the Brant line.

358
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:54,882
I'm not even gonna be able
to see over there.

359
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:55,441
You know what, Matt?

360
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:57,763
Worst-case scenario,
you just-- you lose.

361
00:12:58,255 --> 00:12:59,613
All right?
And that's no big deal.

362
00:12:59,787 --> 00:13:01,353
Yeah, it's a big deal
because then

363
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:03,311
this whole town
is gonna murder me.

364
00:13:03,468 --> 00:13:05,031
And then I'm gonna be sitting
on the bench again.

365
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:07,132
I'm gonna start one year,
and then be riding

366
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:08,111
the bench the next year.

367
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:10,200
You will never be
second string again.

368
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:10,970
Okay?

369
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:12,161
Coach loves you.

370
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:13,730
You, you are--

371
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:15,902
you are his little engine
that could,

372
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:16,693
okay?

373
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:17,953
You're his Seabiscuit.

374
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:20,721
Julie, back me up on this.

375
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:22,200
Coach Taylor loves you so much

376
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:24,730
that you will always be QB1
as long as he's here.

377
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:25,922
Right, Julie?

378
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:29,013
Yeah.

379
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:32,952
So now pretty much

380
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:34,360
half the town hates me

381
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:35,690
because I'm suing
the football team.

382
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:37,890
Doesn't that make you wanna
get outta there?

383
00:13:38,045 --> 00:13:38,682
Outta where?

384
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,122
Out of Dillon.

385
00:13:40,246 --> 00:13:40,733
Yeah.

386
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:42,572
Just leave--screw them!

387
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:43,521
Go where?

388
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:46,353
Go where?
I don't know--anywhere.

389
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:48,480
No, I'm engaged.

390
00:13:48,755 --> 00:13:49,900
I can't go anywhere.

391
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:51,431
It's hard for me
to understand

392
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,341
why anybody would want
to be somewhere

393
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:55,410
where they're not wanted.

394
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:56,821
It's home.

395
00:13:58,286 --> 00:13:59,401
Only home I've ever known.

396
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:00,200
It's just...

397
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:03,043
I can't imagine
I'll be going anywhere else

398
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:03,761
anytime soon.

399
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:07,901
How about Stonehenge II?

400
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,262
Stonehenge II?

401
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:10,062
Have you ever heard of it?

402
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:11,560
It's right over here.

403
00:14:11,736 --> 00:14:12,350
Really?

404
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:13,323
Yeah, we'll go.
It'll cheer you up.

405
00:14:16,785 --> 00:14:18,600
Tyra is such a lovely girl.

406
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:19,791
She's a beautiful girl.

407
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:21,011
My concern is that

408
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:23,081
she's
kinda riding on her looks,

409
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:24,480
and not really using
the brain.

410
00:14:24,516 --> 00:14:26,300
And I think
she's got a great brain.

411
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:27,793
And you know...

412
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:30,472
that looks thing
ain't gonna last forever.

413
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:33,441
So I wanna help her
with the other part of it.

414
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:38,263
Yeah, I'm not really clear
why you got me down here.

415
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:39,252
Sorry, I'll tell you.

416
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,401
I, um--

417
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:42,700
I'm thinking that
if we worked together--

418
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:45,343
if you and kinda did sort of
a tag team

419
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:47,640
and went at her
from both sides--

420
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:50,323
we could really let her know
that this is an important,

421
00:14:50,496 --> 00:14:51,591
critical moment

422
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,262
in her academic life.

423
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,591
You know, I think
that would get her working

424
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:58,842
and really create some hope that
she can turn this thing around.

425
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:00,532
Turn around?

426
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:02,892
I think she's doing pretty well.
It's not like she's

427
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:04,341
some kind of criminal
or something.

428
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:05,712
No, no.
Of course not.

429
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:08,820
What I'm saying is that
I see so much potential in her.

430
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:09,702
And I wanna

431
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:11,280
help her reach that.

432
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:13,323
I was gonna--
I was asking you...

433
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:15,452
to help with that.

434
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:18,572
Tyra is at great risk

435
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:20,542
of not graduating
from high school.

436
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:25,543
Oh, my God.

437
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:27,542
You know who I saw
at the dry cleaner?

438
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:28,722
You're not gonna believe this.

439
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:29,323
Who?

440
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,031
Vickie.

441
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:31,871
She must be in love.
I'm telling you.

442
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:33,182
She has put on a few.

443
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:34,961
I mean, I should talk.
I know, but.

444
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:36,170
- Momma?
- I mean--

445
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:39,671
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

446
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,353
You just keep at it, honey.

447
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:42,890
Really proud of you,

448
00:15:42,978 --> 00:15:44,050
my little schoolgirl.

449
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:46,672
But I mean, honestly.

450
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:49,060
I mean,
she's a good-looking girl too.

451
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:50,102
Hi, I'm Buddy Garrity.

452
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:51,172
Most of y'all know me.

453
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:52,180
For those of you who don't,

454
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:53,291
I'll tell you right now

455
00:15:53,357 --> 00:15:54,840
that you will not find
a better deal

456
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:58,022
on sales or service anywhere
in all of west central Texas.

457
00:15:58,398 --> 00:15:59,880
We pride ourselves

458
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:01,970
on three pillars
of prosperity:

459
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:02,942
Honesty

460
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:03,910
Loyalty

461
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:04,723
and Trust.

462
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:06,232
Also right now,

463
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:07,861
- I'm gonna throw in--
- Just turn it off.

464
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:09,073
You already know he's a loser.

465
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:11,280
And two Panther
play-off tickets.

466
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,073
Just remember,
deep in the heart of Texas,

467
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:13,991
deep in my heart,

468
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:15,292
I'm your Buddy!

469
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:16,082
What heart?

470
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,600
There's a cold stone in there.

471
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:19,132
There's a stone
in his heart.

472
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,603
You know what?
I've got a great idea.

473
00:16:21,787 --> 00:16:22,833
Let's go

474
00:16:23,017 --> 00:16:24,500
pick up your sister
at the club...

475
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,022
and go get our nails done
at the salon.

476
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:29,600
I can't do that.
I got tons of homework.

477
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:31,073
I got an exam
in a couple weeks.

478
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:32,600
Well, I've got
that severance money

479
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:33,872
from that sleazeball.

480
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:34,692
I think we should just

481
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:36,120
go spend it all,
don't you? Come on.

482
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:37,332
Pedicure.

483
00:16:37,616 --> 00:16:38,623
Think about your toes.

484
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:42,143
It's amazing, huh?

485
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:44,691
Yeah.

486
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,940
There's no words
to describe it.

487
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,460
Words are not enough.

488
00:16:55,518 --> 00:16:56,940
So how'd you and Lyla
get engaged?

489
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:58,383
Uh,

490
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:00,353
we called a meeting.

491
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:01,682
You called a meeting?

492
00:17:01,795 --> 00:17:02,953
Yeah, we sat down

493
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,450
and we came to a decision.

494
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:05,852
We thought
it was a good idea.

495
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,511
You were fighting.

496
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:10,020
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

497
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:12,110
What was it about?

498
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,730
Uh, she slept
with my best friend.

499
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:20,323
I'd propose.

500
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:23,510
Yeah.

501
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:26,073
I guess I was just...

502
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:27,910
grasping at straws,

503
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,460
I had lost everything else.

504
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:31,270
Thought if I did it,
I wouldn't lose her too.

505
00:17:34,097 --> 00:17:34,931
I hear ya.

506
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,541
Why are you so easy
to talk to?

507
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:43,300
I just

508
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,702
start saying things I don't
say to anybody else to you.

509
00:17:47,306 --> 00:17:48,991
What do you mean?
You're not like this all the time?

510
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:51,410
Never.

511
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:13,892
Come on.

512
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:16,830
Honey,
are you watching?

513
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,533
'Cause it's fun to dance
with your father.

514
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:19,801
He's a good dancer.

515
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:22,521
And you know what?

516
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:24,170
If you happen
to find yourself

517
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:25,792
with a dancer
who's not so good,

518
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:27,421
you just take lead.

519
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:29,861
And I find, basically,

520
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:31,151
if you just lead with your hips,

521
00:18:31,248 --> 00:18:32,213
the rest'll follow you.

522
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:33,962
You don't need to lead
too close to the hips.

523
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:35,850
Well, you know what I mean.
That's just--

524
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:36,983
As a girl,

525
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:38,101
that's generally what--

526
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:39,713
Come on, get up here.
You try.

527
00:18:40,228 --> 00:18:41,081
- It's fun.
- Come on.

528
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,443
I'm not going
to the dance.

529
00:18:42,698 --> 00:18:43,843
All right, fine. You don't
wanna go to the dance,

530
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:45,413
you don't have to go to the dance.
I've got things  to do.

531
00:18:45,577 --> 00:18:46,021
Well, good.

532
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:46,983
Then I'm excused.

533
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:49,570
No, y'all are going
to the father-daughter dance!

534
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:51,043
I'm gonna pull out my camera.

535
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,361
I'm gonna take a picture
of you both.

536
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:54,060
You're gonna look real happy,

537
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:55,580
and I'm gonna cherish it
for the rest of my life.

538
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:57,781
So y'all stop being a pain
in the ass

539
00:18:57,868 --> 00:18:59,541
and make me happy
for once!

540
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:05,631
Hey, Tyra.
How are you?

541
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,290
Here for the old
tutoring session.

542
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:08,120
Oh, great.

543
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,282
Good, good.

544
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:10,792
Left, right.

545
00:19:11,537 --> 00:19:13,481
Right. Okay.
Now remember.

546
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:15,431
You're in the schoolyard.
Anything goes.

547
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:16,601
That means groin kicks,

548
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:17,981
eye gouges.
Spit in his eye.

549
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:20,132
I don't care.
You do whatever it takes.

550
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:22,073
Okay? Who's it gonna be?

551
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:22,712
Me!

552
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:23,493
Exactly.

553
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:24,720
All right. You ready?

554
00:19:25,316 --> 00:19:25,761
Okay.

555
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:26,911
Again.
Remember--

556
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:28,472
accurate.
Let's go.

557
00:19:29,817 --> 00:19:31,350
Left.
Right.

558
00:19:32,095 --> 00:19:34,191
Right.
Nice.  Left.

559
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:37,810
- Hey.
- There it is.

560
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:39,512
So what's going on here?

561
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:42,570
Tim Riggins is teaching me
how to kick some serious ass.

562
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:43,560
Great.

563
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:45,093
How you doing?

564
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:47,320
Will you run in
and get Momma a soda

565
00:19:47,347 --> 00:19:49,003
with one of those delicious
limes you put in it?

566
00:19:49,265 --> 00:19:49,740
Okay.

567
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:51,461
Thank you.

568
00:19:51,577 --> 00:19:52,582
Bo, don't forget.

569
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:54,831
- Who's it gonna be?
- Me!

570
00:19:55,658 --> 00:19:57,451
What the hell are you doing?

571
00:19:58,378 --> 00:19:59,593
What do you mean
what am I doing?

572
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:01,130
Are you teaching him
to fight?

573
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:02,442
Maybe.

574
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,453
Why you do that?
I'm a pacifist.

575
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:05,470
I'll tell you why.

576
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:07,800
Remember when I went
to pick him up at school?

577
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:08,760
Yeah.

578
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,942
Well, there was about four kids
ready to kick his ass.

579
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:12,500
Four guy--
Are you kidding me?

580
00:20:12,506 --> 00:20:13,100
Where?

581
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,020
- At school.
- At the school?

582
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:15,190
Where was the school monitor?

583
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:17,060
Well, that's the thing.
Maybe I was a bit late.

584
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:17,931
You were late!

585
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:19,451
Didn't I emphasize to you

586
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:20,622
the importance
of not being late?

587
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,291
Look, the point of the matter
is you can't be there

588
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:24,253
every second of his life
to protect him.

589
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:26,732
Okay? He's gotta learn
to protect himself.

590
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:27,851
I think

591
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:30,001
if you teach him
to ignore the bully,

592
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:31,021
the bully'll go away.

593
00:20:31,036 --> 00:20:31,963
You know what?
No offense,

594
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:34,510
but if you ignore a bully, he's
just gonna kick your ass even more.

595
00:20:34,695 --> 00:20:35,350
How do you know?

596
00:20:35,376 --> 00:20:36,823
Were you bullied
in the fourth grade?

597
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:37,450
No.

598
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:39,170
I was the bully.

599
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:41,312
Mm-hmm and why does that
not surprise me?

600
00:20:41,435 --> 00:20:43,171
Look.
I like the kid.

601
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,551
May be a bit awkward and weird,
but he's a good kid, you know?

602
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,660
You being a pacifist is fine.

603
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,601
But him in the fourth grade
as a pacifist,

604
00:20:50,886 --> 00:20:52,221
all that means is
a punching bag.

605
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:55,390
I just want him to be able
to defend himself.

606
00:20:55,477 --> 00:20:56,152
Here you go, Mom.

607
00:20:56,397 --> 00:20:57,180
Hey.

608
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:57,880
There he is.

609
00:20:57,976 --> 00:20:59,983
Thank you.
That is perfect.

610
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:02,712
All right,
well...

611
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,191
finish up...

612
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:05,851
with your, uh...

613
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:07,493
lesson.

614
00:21:08,257 --> 00:21:08,873
Will do.

615
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:13,312
You ready for round two?

616
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,072
Ready!

617
00:21:14,596 --> 00:21:15,611
You know, we're gonna watch

618
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:16,583
Back to the Future...

619
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,350
for the thousandth time...

620
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:20,312
if you wanna watch it
with us tonight.

621
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:22,063
- Sure.
- Yes.

622
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:23,691
All right.

623
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,123
All right.

624
00:21:25,857 --> 00:21:27,273
- Yes!
- Yes.

625
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:27,872
Tyra?

626
00:21:28,338 --> 00:21:30,601
I just want you to know
that you're about to experience

627
00:21:30,646 --> 00:21:31,742
award-winning chili.

628
00:21:32,115 --> 00:21:33,011
Oh, yes.

629
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:34,520
It's award-winning chili.

630
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:35,830
It is award-winning.

631
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:37,320
It won an award
at Dillon Days.

632
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:38,621
It did not win an aw--

633
00:21:38,686 --> 00:21:40,260
It won the booby prize.

634
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:41,490
It didn't win the booby prize.

635
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:42,661
It wasn't the booby prize.

636
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,771
- The Sympathy Prize.
- It was the best first-timer.

637
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:45,702
The Sympathy Prize!

638
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:48,341
Do you like your chili spicy,
lady?

639
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:50,112
- I like spice.
- You like it spicy?

640
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:51,022
- Sure.
- I'm gonna get you some

641
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:52,002
spicy chili a--

642
00:21:52,515 --> 00:21:53,971
- Hey, Miss Collette. How are you doing?
- I knocked. I guess nobody heard,

643
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:56,020
- I guess.
- That doorbell's been broken for years.

644
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:57,722
People just come in all the time.
How are you?

645
00:21:57,756 --> 00:21:58,102
I'm fine.

646
00:21:58,148 --> 00:22:00,161
You know Julie.
That's my husband.

647
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,033
That's Eric.

648
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:02,170
- Nice to meet you.
- You know Julie.

649
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,550
- Sure. Hi, Julie.
- Hey.

650
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:05,181
I'm just about to serve out
some award-winning chili.

651
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:05,991
It's the best chili
you'll ever have.

652
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:07,952
No, that sounds nice.
I can't.

653
00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:10,023
We can't.
We've gotta go,

654
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:10,841
but thank you.

655
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,322
Of course we can stay, Mom.

656
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:14,362
We can't. I've actually
made dinner at home.

657
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:16,101
I cook three meals a day
for my kids

658
00:22:16,138 --> 00:22:17,472
just like regular people.

659
00:22:17,476 --> 00:22:18,300
So we gotta go.

660
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:20,652
Come on.

661
00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:21,482
Get your stuff.

662
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:22,602
Okay.

663
00:22:22,806 --> 00:22:23,372
Thank you.

664
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:25,861
What do you think,

665
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:27,811
they're gonna feed us chili,
then hold us hostage?

666
00:22:27,908 --> 00:22:30,283
You know...What are you doing
in there with those people?

667
00:22:30,507 --> 00:22:31,241
What are you doing?

668
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,612
Learning something,
maybe.

669
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:34,532
Oh, well,

670
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:35,591
let me tell you something.

671
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:38,250
All these ideas she has for you

672
00:22:38,305 --> 00:22:38,960
about going to college--

673
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:39,923
Do you have any idea

674
00:22:39,997 --> 00:22:42,602
how expensive Texas Tech is
per semester?

675
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,100
You are not going
to college, honey.

676
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,291
You're not going
to Texas Tech

677
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,481
because we can't afford it.

678
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:48,173
So all these ideas
she has

679
00:22:48,226 --> 00:22:49,573
about you going
to college--

680
00:22:49,717 --> 00:22:50,930
She's filling your head up
with stuff

681
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:52,613
that you cannot live out.

682
00:22:52,908 --> 00:22:54,000
That is not nice,

683
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:55,091
in my opinion...

684
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:57,240
to fill your head
like that.

685
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:31,762
Oh, no, I got it.

686
00:23:51,156 --> 00:23:52,632
I don't even know
how to thank you

687
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:53,782
for everything
you've done.

688
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:54,620
No worries.

689
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:57,121
- He's sound asleep.
- You're so--

690
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:03,640
What are you doing?!

691
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:04,903
Um, I'm sorry.

692
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:05,950
What are you doing?

693
00:24:06,017 --> 00:24:07,732
- I misread the situation.
- You're a kid.

694
00:24:08,035 --> 00:24:08,650
You're right.

695
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:09,740
Go home.

696
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:11,450
- Tim, you need to go home.
- Yes, ma'am.

697
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:13,190
Oh, my God!

698
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:14,971
Oh, my God.

699
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,560
Come in!

700
00:24:33,546 --> 00:24:34,503
Where've you been?

701
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:36,493
I been calling you
for two days.

702
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:38,641
I came by to ask your parents
what was going on.

703
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:39,942
I didn't make the team.

704
00:24:41,198 --> 00:24:42,142
That's what's going on.

705
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:46,443
I'm sorry.

706
00:24:49,206 --> 00:24:50,711
What are you doing
with your trophies?

707
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:52,651
Can't look at 'em anymore.
You can't look

708
00:24:53,297 --> 00:24:54,791
You can't look
at them anymore?

709
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:55,343
No.

710
00:24:57,425 --> 00:24:58,580
Why haven't you called?

711
00:24:59,525 --> 00:25:00,922
Do you know
how worried I was?

712
00:25:00,988 --> 00:25:02,513
I'm home,
I'm safe, I'm here.

713
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:04,001
Nothing to worry about,
okay?

714
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:06,523
That's it?

715
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,452
How did you get home?

716
00:25:10,488 --> 00:25:11,620
Isn't Herc still
in Austin?

717
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:12,542
I got a ride.

718
00:25:14,837 --> 00:25:15,501
From who?

719
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:17,662
Suzy, actually.
The, uh,

720
00:25:18,407 --> 00:25:19,392
tattoo artist.

721
00:25:19,676 --> 00:25:20,280
Yeah,

722
00:25:20,615 --> 00:25:21,261
I remember.

723
00:25:21,446 --> 00:25:23,121
She had a refrigerator
in the back of her truck

724
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:24,513
she had to drop off
in Barton, so--

725
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:25,380
Sounds good.

726
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:27,591
Sounds like a win-win.

727
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:29,013
Nothing happened.

728
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:29,941
Happen?

729
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,411
- What could happen?
- Nothing.

730
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:33,791
It was just a ride.

731
00:25:34,477 --> 00:25:35,852
A ride from
a really cute girl

732
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:36,911
who gave you a tattoo

733
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:38,353
and is obviously into you

734
00:25:38,356 --> 00:25:40,021
and you must obviously
be into her.

735
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:41,493
Or else you wouldn't feel
so guilty

736
00:25:41,495 --> 00:25:43,002
as to tell me
that nothing happened.

737
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,950
Things have been tough
on both of us lately, all right?

738
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:46,373
A little confusing.

739
00:25:46,506 --> 00:25:47,720
What's that supposed
to mean?

740
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:48,880
I'm just saying that--

741
00:25:48,936 --> 00:25:50,032
Just because I had an affair

742
00:25:50,056 --> 00:25:51,193
that it's okay for you.

743
00:25:51,488 --> 00:25:52,633
Because it's not, Jason.

744
00:25:53,225 --> 00:25:53,940
It's not.

745
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,031
Lyla,
I didn't have an affair.

746
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:02,202
Let's just be really,
really honest

747
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:03,672
with each other
right now, Jason.

748
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:08,280
Do you wanna be engaged
to me?

749
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:14,220
Do you?

750
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:17,451
I don't know.

751
00:26:28,676 --> 00:26:29,461
I got it.

752
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:37,913
Hi, Pammy.

753
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:40,163
I want you to leave

754
00:26:40,226 --> 00:26:40,993
right now.

755
00:26:41,297 --> 00:26:42,703
Pam, please,
please, please!

756
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:44,671
Pam!
Be calm, okay?

757
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:45,470
- What do you want, Buddy?
- Let's just be calm.

758
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:46,140
What do you want?

759
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:49,141
I have something really special
that I'd like to present to you.

760
00:26:50,557 --> 00:26:51,271
What's this?

761
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:53,231
This is the Garrity
family album.

762
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:55,690
All the good times.

763
00:26:56,495 --> 00:26:57,190
Look at this.

764
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,080
Remember these?

765
00:26:59,198 --> 00:27:01,371
I wasn't so bad
when I was young, was I?

766
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:02,411
Lyla...

767
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:04,980
helped me put it together.

768
00:27:06,448 --> 00:27:07,513
I need you
to listen to me

769
00:27:07,555 --> 00:27:10,353
when I tell you I don't want you
coming over here again.

770
00:27:10,436 --> 00:27:11,970
You have done enough.

771
00:27:12,115 --> 00:27:13,962
I have been embarrassed
in front of

772
00:27:13,998 --> 00:27:15,921
this entire town.
Okay?

773
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:17,291
- Pam, look.
- No!

774
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:19,651
You have made a laughingstock
out of this family

775
00:27:19,735 --> 00:27:22,261
to the point where I have
considered leaving my home.

776
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,571
You take your damn memories,
Buddy,

777
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:25,431
and you get out.

778
00:27:25,467 --> 00:27:26,632
Because right now,
I am just

779
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,410
trying
to hold this family together.

780
00:27:28,456 --> 00:27:30,550
- So please leave!
- Pam, I've always loved--

781
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:33,620
Mom.

782
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:35,933
Lyla, I do not want you
taking his side again.

783
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:36,733
I'm not taking sides.

784
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:37,781
Yes, you are, Lyla.

785
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:38,663
And it hurts.

786
00:27:38,788 --> 00:27:40,752
I didn't, Mom.
He made one mistake.

787
00:27:40,877 --> 00:27:42,471
Doesn't he deserve
a second chance?

788
00:27:42,498 --> 00:27:44,003
I mean,
you can at least talk to him.

789
00:27:44,156 --> 00:27:45,071
- Please!
- No.

790
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:47,252
- One mistake, remember?
- You don't know what he is.

791
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,920
He made one mistake!

792
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:50,130
He is a liar!

793
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:51,483
He is my father!

794
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:54,061
He has been unfaithful to me
for our entire marriage.

795
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:55,412
It isn't just Angela!

796
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:56,741
You don't think
I know about Ruth,

797
00:27:56,865 --> 00:27:58,242
your last secretary,
and why she left?!

798
00:27:58,337 --> 00:27:59,530
What are you talking about?

799
00:27:59,536 --> 00:28:00,973
And I am sorry that you have
to hear this.

800
00:28:01,017 --> 00:28:03,650
I'm sorry your own daughter
has to hear me say this.

801
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,480
- Mom!
- You bastard!

802
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:08,010
- Look what you've done to us!
- It's not true, Lyla.

803
00:28:08,637 --> 00:28:09,630
I am sorry.

804
00:28:09,825 --> 00:28:10,912
Pam, please.

805
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:11,632
Sorry.

806
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:13,612
Lyla?

807
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:16,991
- Let Daddy in, honey.
- Leave!

808
00:28:28,738 --> 00:28:30,511
I know she's never really
liked Dillon.

809
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:31,780
I mean, she never has,

810
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:34,273
but you'd think she'd like Austin.
I know she'd like Austin.

811
00:28:34,578 --> 00:28:36,152
I know, sweetie.
I agree with you.

812
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:37,661
Which one of these
should I wear?

813
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,083
Oh, the blue.

814
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:40,951
Oh, you're gonna look like

815
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:43,942
super dapper dad in that blue.

816
00:28:46,297 --> 00:28:47,282
Can you help me
with that?

817
00:28:48,676 --> 00:28:50,800
Tighter than a drum
like always.

818
00:28:50,838 --> 00:28:51,830
Oh, it feels good.

819
00:28:55,378 --> 00:28:56,130
You know what?

820
00:28:58,355 --> 00:29:00,243
I don't think it has anything
to do with Dillon.

821
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:02,711
I think it has to do
with me, babe. It's me.

822
00:29:02,787 --> 00:29:04,022
No, I don't think it's you.

823
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:05,122
- It is me.
- I don't think it's you.

824
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:07,102
I don't think it's Dillon.
I don't think it's Austin.

825
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:08,170
What is it then?

826
00:29:09,506 --> 00:29:11,243
I think our little girl's
in love.

827
00:29:13,265 --> 00:29:14,213
I know it.

828
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:20,272
- Hey.
- Woooow.

829
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:21,531
You look really nice.

830
00:29:22,787 --> 00:29:24,092
I'm only going
for one song.

831
00:29:25,147 --> 00:29:26,263
And then I'm going home.

832
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,092
All right. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

833
00:29:30,456 --> 00:29:31,323
I'm taking your picture.

834
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:35,582
Smile.

835
00:29:42,986 --> 00:29:43,871
Can't sell that to you.

836
00:29:44,508 --> 00:29:45,960
You're not gonna sell it to me
'cause I'm crippled?

837
00:29:46,138 --> 00:29:47,442
No, I'm not gonna
sell it to you

838
00:29:47,517 --> 00:29:48,433
because you're 17.

839
00:29:49,946 --> 00:29:50,810
Come on, Ant.

840
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:52,271
If I was still playing--

841
00:29:53,115 --> 00:29:53,811
Jason,

842
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:55,001
I can't sell it to you.

843
00:29:55,956 --> 00:29:56,760
Try down the street.

844
00:29:57,036 --> 00:29:57,843
I already did.

845
00:29:58,706 --> 00:30:00,240
You drinking alone,
Six?

846
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:03,771
You got an I.D., sir?

847
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:05,680
You bet.

848
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:15,911
Appreciate your business,
Sergeant Riggins.

849
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:21,742
Don't have too much fun.

850
00:30:25,017 --> 00:30:25,531
Yeah.

851
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:26,722
Have a great night.

852
00:30:28,187 --> 00:30:29,603
All you wear is Panther gear.

853
00:30:29,738 --> 00:30:31,782
You got Panther T-shirts,
you got Panther sweatshirts.

854
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:33,532
I think you forgot
something.

855
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:34,553
You didn't have
to do that, man.

856
00:30:35,206 --> 00:30:36,592
It's, like, quilted,
you know?

857
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,113
Oh, you--oh!
Oh.

858
00:30:39,336 --> 00:30:41,060
Street!
Hey, Street!

859
00:30:41,797 --> 00:30:42,533
Hey, Street!

860
00:30:42,618 --> 00:30:43,522
How you doing, Smash?

861
00:30:43,577 --> 00:30:45,261
What's going on, baby?

862
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:46,131
What it do?

863
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:47,440
Hey, you wanna
come out with us?

864
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:48,892
No, I don't, I don't--

865
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:50,061
Hey, come on.
You should come with us.

866
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:50,662
Yeah, man.

867
00:30:50,728 --> 00:30:52,273
Uh, I--oh!

868
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:54,360
Come on, man. Look,
we'll put your chair in the trunk.

869
00:30:56,745 --> 00:30:58,643
So what do you mean
she's bipolar?

870
00:30:58,888 --> 00:31:00,010
It means she crazy.

871
00:31:00,348 --> 00:31:02,132
Look, Matt. It just means
that she got issues,

872
00:31:02,498 --> 00:31:02,933
you know,

873
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:04,373
just like everybody else
in this town.

874
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:07,802
- How you handling it?
- Taking it like a man, Matty.

875
00:31:08,587 --> 00:31:09,143
You know.

876
00:31:10,028 --> 00:31:11,742
Avoiding the calls,
ducking out,

877
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:12,730
hiding in the bushes.

878
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:16,623
Ladies and gentlemen!

879
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:19,202
I present to you,

880
00:31:19,395 --> 00:31:21,210
you, you...

881
00:31:21,636 --> 00:31:24,502
the great and noble men

882
00:31:24,738 --> 00:31:26,640
of Dillon Panther football.

883
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:28,830
Thank you!
Come on baby!

884
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,501
- Cheers, gentlemen.
- Thank you,

885
00:31:30,675 --> 00:31:31,161
thank you!

886
00:31:31,207 --> 00:31:32,141
Here he come, baby.

887
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:33,692
Oh, don't miss a step now.

888
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:35,213
Come on down, baby!

889
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:36,630
Ladies and gentlemen,

890
00:31:37,308 --> 00:31:39,822
Mr. Timmy Riggins!

891
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:41,800
No, no, Rig.
Seriously.

892
00:31:41,876 --> 00:31:43,723
I remember Spivey said
he catches anyone messing

893
00:31:43,766 --> 00:31:46,080
around out here,
they're gonna lose game time.

894
00:31:46,128 --> 00:31:47,791
You see what I been
putting up with all season?

895
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:49,193
Come on, Saracen.
What are they gonna do, huh?

896
00:31:49,378 --> 00:31:50,912
Bench you, start me?

897
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:52,411
Look at Street, folks.

898
00:31:52,597 --> 00:31:53,563
He's on a tear.

899
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,030
Seriously, look,

900
00:31:55,097 --> 00:31:57,112
I got a lotta
crap going on right now,

901
00:31:57,145 --> 00:31:59,511
and I don't need
another problem, okay?

902
00:31:59,957 --> 00:32:01,123
You got troubles, Matty?

903
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,672
What you got, QB1?

904
00:32:02,747 --> 00:32:05,391
Saracen's got a little something
on his mind, fellas.

905
00:32:05,438 --> 00:32:07,503
Oh, you got troubles, Matty?
Come on, talk to the Smash.

906
00:32:07,555 --> 00:32:08,320
I'll help you out.

907
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:10,310
I'm just saying.
Never mind.

908
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:12,493
Look, you wanna see
troubles, look at me.

909
00:32:12,956 --> 00:32:14,243
Me and crazy Wavey.

910
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:16,180
We comparing
girl problems now?

911
00:32:16,675 --> 00:32:18,571
I just tried to make out
with my next-door neighbor

912
00:32:18,596 --> 00:32:20,281
who's at least in her
mid-thirties.

913
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:23,150
Pretty much got put
through the wall for that one.

914
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:24,970
So I think I win.

915
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:25,673
No.

916
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,022
Chair says I win.

917
00:32:29,788 --> 00:32:30,760
Every time.

918
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,352
He, he got that.

919
00:32:34,127 --> 00:32:34,960
Six wins.

920
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:39,122
All right, so maybe my problems
aren't as big as y'all's, but

921
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:42,543
look. I'm just not gonna be able
to take this team any further.

922
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:44,180
I mean, Brant's line is huge.

923
00:32:44,608 --> 00:32:46,501
I mean, I helped get us
to the semi-finals--that's it.

924
00:32:46,518 --> 00:32:48,573
I'm gonna let
this whole town down.

925
00:32:49,156 --> 00:32:51,422
Their defensive end could
probably beat me in the 40.

926
00:32:51,448 --> 00:32:52,973
I don't understand
how I can help.

927
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:55,222
I'd be doing better off
on the bench.

928
00:32:55,837 --> 00:32:56,280
Saracen.

929
00:32:56,995 --> 00:32:57,940
You wanna play big,

930
00:32:58,547 --> 00:32:59,502
you think big, all right?

931
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:01,823
I'm gonna show you how.

932
00:33:04,335 --> 00:33:05,113
On the ball!

933
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:06,883
Come on, Saracen.
You got some work to do.

934
00:33:07,205 --> 00:33:08,182
Line it up, boys!

935
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:10,083
Stay on your toes, Matty.
Stay on your toes.

936
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:11,260
High, let it go!

937
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:12,771
Beautiful!

938
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:15,382
Tops of your toes!
Ball high, ball high! Go!

939
00:33:15,855 --> 00:33:17,632
Stay tall, stay tall.
Pump!

940
00:33:17,986 --> 00:33:18,580
Go!

941
00:33:19,655 --> 00:33:20,302
Nice pump.

942
00:33:21,106 --> 00:33:21,783
Nice!

943
00:33:22,055 --> 00:33:22,950
Whoo!

944
00:33:23,816 --> 00:33:25,231
18-yard, deep out,
okay?

945
00:33:25,698 --> 00:33:26,730
I can't hit that.

946
00:33:26,846 --> 00:33:27,871
He can't, he can't.

947
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:30,230
Half the players in college
can't even hit that route.

948
00:33:30,237 --> 00:33:31,081
Well, you can hit it.

949
00:33:31,186 --> 00:33:33,301
It's just an automatic six
for the other team.

950
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:34,291
Coach doesn't even have it
in the playbook.

951
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:35,361
Look at me and listen me.

952
00:33:35,895 --> 00:33:36,842
When you're doing your drop,

953
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:38,261
you look off
the weak side safety.

954
00:33:38,678 --> 00:33:39,772
That means
you keep your head left.

955
00:33:40,225 --> 00:33:40,720
Okay?

956
00:33:41,176 --> 00:33:42,471
As soon as Riggins
makes his break,

957
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:43,953
you need to open your body up

958
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:45,781
and you let the ball go.
On the break,

959
00:33:45,906 --> 00:33:46,731
high and outside.

960
00:33:46,785 --> 00:33:48,402
Any corner in this league's
gonna break on that,

961
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:49,722
think he's got
a sure interception.

962
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:52,061
But he doesn't because you're
putting the ball high and outside,

963
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,490
where only your man can get it.

964
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:54,681
You hit the slants,

965
00:33:54,845 --> 00:33:55,801
you hit the posts,

966
00:33:55,927 --> 00:33:56,683
they'll respect you.

967
00:33:57,145 --> 00:33:58,223
You hit this pattern,

968
00:33:58,985 --> 00:33:59,790
they will fear you.

969
00:34:00,198 --> 00:34:01,240
Let me see you run it.

970
00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:02,963
Get on the line!

971
00:34:04,315 --> 00:34:05,652
You stay on the tops
of your toes.

972
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:06,582
Set!

973
00:34:06,737 --> 00:34:07,820
- Hit!
- That's right.

974
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:08,753
That's right.

975
00:34:08,928 --> 00:34:10,272
Flick him off.
Flick him off.

976
00:34:10,557 --> 00:34:11,491
Here comes the break.

977
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:12,530
High and outside!

978
00:34:12,896 --> 00:34:14,432
High and outside!
High and outside!

979
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:16,932
Whoo!

980
00:34:17,027 --> 00:34:17,780
There it is.

981
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:18,973
I just hit it.

982
00:34:19,236 --> 00:34:19,923
Yes, you did.

983
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:33,072
So aren't we gonna go in?

984
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:35,270
Mm-mm.

985
00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:39,551
I wanna talk to you
about something.

986
00:34:40,428 --> 00:34:41,612
About you and Matt.

987
00:34:42,097 --> 00:34:43,953
Dad, I don't think--

988
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:45,421
Just hang on a second.
Let me finish, please.

989
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:48,413
I know you two
are very close.

990
00:34:49,507 --> 00:34:52,190
And I know that it's not
easy on you, leaving this town.

991
00:34:54,206 --> 00:34:57,460
And I apologize to you for
being insensitive about that.

992
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:58,540
I am sorry.

993
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:01,383
Did Mom tell you
to say that?

994
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:02,571
Nope, this is all mine.

995
00:35:04,098 --> 00:35:07,131
I also wanna say
that you are 15 years old.

996
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:10,871
And you are not gonna dictate
where this family's gonna live.

997
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:14,592
But you are also
15 years old.

998
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:17,772
And you also deserve
the respect,

999
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,811
and you deserve to have
your opinion heard

1000
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:24,080
by both your mother
and myself.

1001
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:26,582
Do you really wanna know
my opinion?

1002
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:28,952
I do.

1003
00:35:32,935 --> 00:35:34,841
My opinion is that

1004
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:37,192
when you told me we
were gonna move to Dillon,

1005
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,110
I seriously wanted
to vomit.

1006
00:35:41,985 --> 00:35:43,690
And my opinion
when we got here

1007
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,630
was that every fear
I had about moving...

1008
00:35:49,418 --> 00:35:50,200
came true.

1009
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:51,912
And then...

1010
00:35:54,896 --> 00:35:55,960
it changed.

1011
00:35:57,717 --> 00:35:59,233
And I was actually happy.

1012
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:05,710
I've been moving around
my entire life.

1013
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:07,363
And...

1014
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:10,832
for the first time,

1015
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:14,580
it just felt
like I was at home.

1016
00:36:16,965 --> 00:36:19,562
And I know going
to Austin

1017
00:36:19,617 --> 00:36:22,942
and being some college
football coach is your dream.

1018
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:26,351
But I have dreams too.

1019
00:36:28,878 --> 00:36:30,410
And they're coming true
right here.

1020
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:34,212
I hear you.

1021
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:41,270
So we should just go in
and get this over with.

1022
00:36:43,605 --> 00:36:44,263
All right.

1023
00:36:54,768 --> 00:36:55,762
I love you.

1024
00:36:57,985 --> 00:36:59,550
So honey,
just get anything you want.

1025
00:36:59,578 --> 00:37:01,801
Like I said, it's on me,
so just get anything.

1026
00:37:02,065 --> 00:37:02,980
I think I'm gonna get a big,

1027
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:05,142
fat margarita
and some ribs, I think,

1028
00:37:05,175 --> 00:37:06,671
if somebody would just
come over here--

1029
00:37:06,717 --> 00:37:07,993
What the hell is the matter
with you?!

1030
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:09,500
Then I won't get ribs.

1031
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:10,431
No, no!

1032
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:12,640
I'm talking about us.
I'm talking about me.

1033
00:37:12,956 --> 00:37:14,391
The way that you acted
at the Taylor's,

1034
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:16,291
embarrassing me like that,
what you said to me in the car.

1035
00:37:16,345 --> 00:37:17,420
What is going on
with you?

1036
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:19,511
I don't want to talk about
this right now. I just--

1037
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:20,451
Well, I do.

1038
00:37:21,428 --> 00:37:23,530
I wanna get outta here.
I wanna get outta here.

1039
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,810
I can't sit here
with these fathers and daughters

1040
00:37:25,857 --> 00:37:27,770
with their little flower things.
I can't do it!

1041
00:37:27,947 --> 00:37:29,352
Honey, let's just go.

1042
00:37:29,676 --> 00:37:30,220
Let go!

1043
00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:31,382
I'm serious.

1044
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm just saying.
I just don't wanna feel like

1045
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:37,991
you feel like
you need to be

1046
00:37:37,997 --> 00:37:39,603
- something that you're not.
- Well, I don't!

1047
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:41,202
I don't feel that way!

1048
00:37:41,397 --> 00:37:42,800
Mom, listen!

1049
00:37:43,366 --> 00:37:44,331
Listen to me.

1050
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:47,372
I wanna try this,
okay?

1051
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:50,420
I wanna break the mold.

1052
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:51,342
The Collette mold.

1053
00:37:51,385 --> 00:37:52,731
I wanna go to college.

1054
00:37:53,128 --> 00:37:54,671
I wanna have this life

1055
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:56,373
and I think I can.

1056
00:37:59,245 --> 00:37:59,790
But I...

1057
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:02,803
I can't do any of it
without you.

1058
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,803
And that one goes out to
all the fathers and daughters

1059
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,193
at Dillon High School
tonight.

1060
00:38:28,846 --> 00:38:29,451
Mom!

1061
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:31,222
Uh, excuse me, please.

1062
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,083
Momma, what--

1063
00:38:32,116 --> 00:38:33,232
I need your tickets.

1064
00:38:33,498 --> 00:38:35,462
Mom, what are we doing here?

1065
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:37,761
What do you think
we're doing here?

1066
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:38,671
Well, I don't know!

1067
00:38:38,706 --> 00:38:41,343
Look, all right? I just wanna
tell you something, all right?

1068
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:44,223
I just want you to know
something which is that

1069
00:38:44,317 --> 00:38:46,381
I love you
more than anything

1070
00:38:46,415 --> 00:38:48,060
in this whole world

1071
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:49,790
and I know I'm messy.

1072
00:38:49,907 --> 00:38:50,611
But you know,

1073
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:51,920
I'm gonna do my best

1074
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:53,432
to do everything

1075
00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:54,642
that I can for you--

1076
00:38:54,756 --> 00:38:56,203
everything that I can.

1077
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:57,212
Okay?

1078
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:00,020
I promise.

1079
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:24,630
That is so brokeback, man.

1080
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:33,633
Friends?

1081
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:37,010
Yeah.

1082
00:40:39,357 --> 00:40:40,103
Always.

1083
00:40:43,768 --> 00:40:44,730
Texas forever.

1084
00:40:46,265 --> 00:40:47,710
Texas forever, man.

1085
00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:11,712
Where's Bo?

1086
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,170
He's at piano practice.

1087
00:41:23,366 --> 00:41:24,282
I, uh...

1088
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:28,092
I just wanna apologize
for the other night.

1089
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:30,233
I'm sorry.

1090
00:41:35,106 --> 00:41:35,950
All right.

1091
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,332
Bo can never know.

1092
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:55,741
Okay?

1093
00:41:56,435 --> 00:41:57,333
Never.

1094
00:42:02,858 --> 00:42:03,403
Yeah.

1095
00:42:04,306 --> 00:42:06,892
No, I thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

1096
00:42:07,465 --> 00:42:08,213
All right.
You too.

1097
00:42:08,957 --> 00:42:09,372
Bye.

1098
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,430
What'd you tell the people
at TMU?

1099
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:27,030
I said that
I needed some time to decide.

1100
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:31,762
My family needed
some time.
