1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:02,602
................

2
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:06,537
He flings him into the ropes,

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:09,073
and, oh, a devastating clothesline.

4
00:00:09,157 --> 00:00:11,425
........

5
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:12,992
Hey, Timmy.

6
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:14,193
Your dad's here.

7
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:16,028
Do I have to go ?

8
00:00:17,262 --> 00:00:18,492
What's up, buddy ?

9
00:00:18,527 --> 00:00:20,492
Ready to hang with your old man ?

10
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,893
What do you expect, Mick ?

11
00:00:22,927 --> 00:00:24,477
You blow him off
every other weekend.

12
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:26,540
What do you expect when you
bad-mouth me the way you do ?

13
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:28,530
Oh, you think I'm the reason
you two have problems ?

14
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:30,308
"Bring your dad to school day",

15
00:00:30,343 --> 00:00:31,319
He didn't even bother asking you

16
00:00:31,353 --> 00:00:33,282
'cause he knew you wouldn't show.

17
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:35,202
Is that true, Timmy ?

18
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:44,155
<i>"Livin' on a prayer"
by Bon Jovi.</i>

19
00:00:45,944 --> 00:00:48,120
Machine ! Machine ! Machine !

20
00:00:50,163 --> 00:00:52,639
You know, I would've came to
your school if you'd told me about it.

21
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:53,649
It's no big deal.

22
00:00:53,683 --> 00:00:56,364
Already had another
dockworker there anyway.

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,748
You give Ma the money you owe her ?

24
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:03,528
What are you gonna do,
break my thumbs or something ?

25
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:06,107
I'll take care of it.

26
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:12,935
Look at your Machine now !

27
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:15,681
Looks like he broke down.

28
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:18,054
You want more ?

29
00:01:18,488 --> 00:01:20,328
You want blood ?!

30
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:28,357
Garbage ! Garbage ! Garbage !

31
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,100
Look at that.

32
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:32,806
Can bend his arm and everything.

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,276
These are pretty cool dolls, huh?

34
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:35,546
They're wrestlers.

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,592
Like to see them
unload a cargo ship.

36
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:43,303
Mom says dockworkers are dirty.

37
00:01:43,338 --> 00:01:44,306
And wrestlers ain't?

38
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:46,343
Wrestlers are the coolest,

39
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:48,483
strongest guys on the planet.

40
00:01:50,992 --> 00:01:52,261
What, so you'd like me better

41
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:55,404
if I throw on some tights,
go prancing around a ring?

42
00:01:56,238 --> 00:01:58,412
Shut up, Dad. They're cool.

43
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,396
Machine ! Machine !

44
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:21,200
The new WIC heavyweight champion...

45
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:22,638
Machine ! Machine !

46
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:26,377
Mick "The Machine" Malone !

47
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,859
.44 Magnum.

48
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:13,199
Traded in during an anonymous
Guns for Groceries program.

49
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:15,303
It's... a cannon.

50
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:17,106
A lot of groceries for this thing.

51
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,609
Ballistics got a hit.

52
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:21,980
The gun killed a Mick Malone,
June of '86.

53
00:03:22,014 --> 00:03:23,384
A dockworker.

54
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:24,720
Killed at the pier.

55
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:26,756
Yeah, Mick had a reputation
for busting kneecaps

56
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,427
as low-level muscle for
the Longshoreman's Union.

57
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:31,164
Dangerous moonlighting.

58
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:33,434
Figure Mick's death was related.
But keep reading.

59
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:37,407
Mick was also a wrestler
for the WIC, indie circuit.

60
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:39,376
That where Humpty Dumpty
comes in ?

61
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:41,414
Bear Jacobs.

62
00:03:41,548 --> 00:03:43,351
Gun's registered in his name.

63
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:44,653
We pulled him from a match.

64
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:47,024
You mean he doesn't dress
like that all the time ?

65
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,862
Waitin' forever.

66
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,199
80 buck purse I missed out
on tonight.

67
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,268
Well, you got bigger
concerns, Bear.

68
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:57,874
You found my baby !

69
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:58,975
Where was she ?

70
00:03:59,008 --> 00:03:59,712
You're pretty excited

71
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:01,215
to own a gun with a body on it.

72
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,551
A body ?
Hell you talkin' about ?

73
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:05,487
Mick "Machine" Malone.

74
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:07,257
In the WIC together.

75
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,592
I didn't kill Mick.

76
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:10,728
Only wrestled him
a couple of times.

77
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,396
Crowd loved him.

78
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,631
Then how do you explain

79
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:16,498
this whole you owning
the gun situation ?

80
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:18,533
I ain't had her

81
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:21,367
since March of '86.

82
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:24,636
And I know exactly where she went.

83
00:04:31,876 --> 00:04:33,576
You report the gun stolen, Bear ?

84
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:36,044
Wanted to find the son
of a bitch myself.

85
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:38,645
Guy was a jobber
to the mid-carders.

86
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,513
Hired to be heat every night ?

87
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,449
Jumped around the circuits.

88
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:45,218
Only got work 'cause he
could do a Commie accent.

89
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,286
Cold War saved his ass.

90
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,356
- Who was this guy ?
- Red Scare.

91
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,625
Don't know his real name.

92
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,560
Remember where you were
when Mick got killed ?

93
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,294
Twenty-some years ago ?

94
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,529
Where were you ?

95
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,797
It's not my gun that killed a guy.

96
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,466
June 16, 1986.

97
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,702
Probably at the Traffic Light.

98
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:08,337
Dated a waitress there. Sapphire.

99
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:09,272
Well, Bear,

100
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:11,173
your new ring is going
to be a holding cell

101
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,808
till she vouches for you.

102
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:15,676
Might want to call for
some extra clothes.

103
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:17,078
Gets chilly downstairs.

104
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:18,879
Hey, when I get out,

105
00:05:19,113 --> 00:05:21,247
you gonna give me my gun back ?

106
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,050
Yeah, I'll have it gift wrapped
for you.

107
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:30,319
Cold Case
Season 7 Episode 16

108
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:54,751
One fall

109
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:06,586
Mick "The Machine" Malone.

110
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:07,954
Twenty-eight.

111
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:10,723
Murdered June 16, 1986.

112
00:06:10,757 --> 00:06:12,358
Baby-face of the WIC.

113
00:06:12,392 --> 00:06:14,226
- Baby-face ?
- Good guy.

114
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,762
Would've headlined against other
heels as the fan favorite.

115
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:18,963
Lil apparently was

116
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:20,797
a Hulkamaniac back in the day.

117
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:22,799
You like that nonsense ?

118
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:25,468
Oh, it distracted me for a
few hours every Saturday.

119
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:28,605
Assigned talked to some
wrestlers back in '86,

120
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,773
and Lance Kotrola, WIC's promoter.

121
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:33,375
Well, Mick's last match was
ten days before he was killed,

122
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:35,277
against "Sweet" Sil Tavern.

123
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:37,880
Well, Mick had a nine-year-old son,
Tim,

124
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,581
with ex-wife, Rachel.

125
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,549
Night Mick was murdered,
she was with Tim at the hospital.

126
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:44,918
Did a midnight shift
at the local diner.

127
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:45,985
I'll reach out to the son,

128
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:47,219
see what he knows.

129
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:48,554
Let's pay Lance a visit, too.

130
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:50,456
Might know who the Red Scare was.

131
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,091
Hey, uh, either of you heard
from Vera ?

132
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:56,460
Think he's tracking down
Bear's alibi.

133
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:58,295
Yeah.

134
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:03,902
Supposed to have
breakfast with him,

135
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:05,937
but the dude never showed.

136
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:07,973
Left him a couple messages myself.

137
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:09,875
He's probably just
hungover somewhere.

138
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:11,410
You know what's going on
with him ?

139
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:13,745
Whatever it is,
he's keeping it to himself.

140
00:07:28,294 --> 00:07:29,593
You were at the hospital

141
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:31,060
the night your dad died ?

142
00:07:31,094 --> 00:07:33,661
Broke my arm playing football.

143
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:35,895
Got a cast, nothing big.

144
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:38,430
Your dad ever mention a wrestler
named Red Scare ?

145
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:39,998
Red Scare ?

146
00:07:40,032 --> 00:07:41,499
Nah.

147
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:44,835
I thought he got killed 'cause
of something he did down here.

148
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,738
We're just looking into
a wrestling connection.

149
00:07:47,972 --> 00:07:50,407
Wrestling brought us closer.

150
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:52,609
Brought us all closer.

151
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,213
Look what I got for you, buddy.

152
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:01,950
Bill "The Thrill" !

153
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:03,751
Awesome !

154
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:06,821
Yeah, don't look now, but someday
that's gonna be a Mick Malone doll.

155
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:08,321
I mean, wrestler.

156
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,891
Yeah, you wish, Dad.

157
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,626
Oh, I wish ?

158
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,598
Where did you learn that move ?

159
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,266
I've been getting in
the ring a little bit.

160
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,867
Going to this wrestling school.

161
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,035
No way !

162
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:25,803
That's the coolest
thing I've ever heard.

163
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:27,637
It's the coolest thing
I've ever done.

164
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:29,372
But you're still unloading cargo ?

165
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:31,708
Yeah, I mean, I'm not going
to quit my job.

166
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:33,976
You know, maybe someday,
right, buddy ?

167
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:35,211
Yeah.

168
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:37,479
I can't tell who's the adult
between the two of you.

169
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:40,649
Look, wrestling's honest work.

170
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:42,784
It beats debt collecting.

171
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:44,318
That's not saying much.

172
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:46,686
What happens if you get hurt
in the ring ?

173
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:47,954
Nah, it's fine.

174
00:08:47,989 --> 00:08:49,722
It's all for show.

175
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:50,957
Nobody really gets hurt.

176
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:52,391
Anyways, here.

177
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:54,093
It's...

178
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:55,594
it's from my first match.

179
00:08:55,628 --> 00:08:57,129
It's not much.
I'm just a jobber now.

180
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,130
But...

181
00:08:58,164 --> 00:08:59,798
I'll get more
if I stick with it.

182
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:03,235
Okay.

183
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:05,103
Great.

184
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:07,506
Still need a ring name, though.

185
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,141
I was thinking maybe you could
come up with something, Timmy.

186
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,709
Yeah, something cool, you know.

187
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:14,244
Like...

188
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:15,612
"The Machine."

189
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:16,912
The Machine ?

190
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:19,113
Like you're unstoppable.

191
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:22,016
Like you grind people up
and drill 'em into the mat.

192
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,552
See, now that's the coolest
thing I've ever heard.

193
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:26,454
You ready to hang
with your old man ?

194
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:28,222
Totally. Let's go.

195
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:32,926
That was probably the happiest
time from when I was a kid.

196
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,428
My dad coming back
in my life like that.

197
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:38,063
You know any of the wrestlers
your dad hung out with ?

198
00:09:38,097 --> 00:09:41,165
No. Mom never let me go
to any of his matches.

199
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:45,333
But I got every bootleg tape
I can find with him on it.

200
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,904
- Mind if I take a look at those ?
- Be my guest.

201
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,139
You know, I'm pretty sure the
only reason he got in the ring

202
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:55,212
was... because of me.

203
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:01,283
Quite an operation, Lance.

204
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,753
That chair you're in-- ten grand.

205
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:08,190
Yeah, you know, the WWE,
they had these

206
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:11,093
perfect polished little matches
back in the '80s.

207
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:13,262
And I said screw
that with two words :

208
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:15,498
- garbage wrestling.
- I guess bloodlust

209
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,600
is where it's at, even if it's fake.

210
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:19,501
Well, my matches may
be predetermined,

211
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,303
but they're far from fake.

212
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:24,306
Athletes have to have pretty
big brass ones to rep the WIC.

213
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,007
Guys like Mick Malone ?

214
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,741
Is that what this is all about ?

215
00:10:27,776 --> 00:10:29,942
Well, Mick stopped wrestling
ten days before he died,

216
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:32,143
after his match with Sil Tavern.

217
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:33,378
Why was he off the card ?

218
00:10:33,412 --> 00:10:34,612
"Kayfabe".

219
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:36,079
You know, keeping up appearances

220
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:37,381
outside of the ring.

221
00:10:37,415 --> 00:10:38,415
Acting.

222
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:41,418
More time off to build hype
for a feud.

223
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:44,588
Sil and Mick have any real
beef behind the scenes ?

224
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:47,324
Please. Someone in the family
does well, we all do well.

225
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:48,825
Red Scare part of that family ?

226
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:49,825
Are you kidding ?

227
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,294
I fired that crackhead
over 20 years ago.

228
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:53,896
He got a real name ?

229
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,331
Nate Beecher.

230
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:57,232
What was the deal
with him and Mick ?

231
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:59,634
Well, they were both jobbers,
trying to move up the ranks,

232
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:03,102
but Mick was a natural
at what mattered most...

233
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:07,771
Not only am I the champion,

234
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:12,140
but I also have the greatest title
of them all :

235
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:15,242
The Sweet One.

236
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,510
Men are honored

237
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,211
to lose to Sil Tavern.

238
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,746
Then they can run
to their girlfriends

239
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,580
and tell them they were just beaten

240
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,648
by the prettiest there ever was.

241
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:28,917
Oh, and ladies,

242
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:32,490
if you notice, this face...

243
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:35,261
not a scratch on it.

244
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:36,895
Cut.

245
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,363
Superb.

246
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:41,666
Okay, who's next ?

247
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,002
You, Red Scare,
let's see what you got.

248
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,474
I Red Scare.

249
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,743
My dropkicks like missiles
from Gorbachev.

250
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:55,545
Cut. Lame.

251
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:58,847
Anybody with some freakin'
personality here, please.

252
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:06,816
Well, let me tell you something, Lance.

253
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:11,755
When the big boss man in the
sky created The Machine,

254
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:13,690
he gave me one job :

255
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:17,158
crushing punks like sissy Sil Tavern.

256
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:20,862
And until you're in that driller slam,

257
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:23,598
and you hear that one...

258
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:25,866
two, three,

259
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,335
I'll be putting in overtime.

260
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:30,869
So get ready all you
gearheads out there,

261
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:32,003
'cause The Machine

262
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:35,072
is going to work !

263
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,408
What do you think,
you're better than me ?

264
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:45,809
<i>"Round and Round" by Ratt.</i>

265
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:49,718
Mick had headliner
written all over him.

266
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:54,289
Red Scare : just a jealous loser
that I kicked to the curb.

267
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:55,789
- Know where he is now ?
- Last I heard

268
00:12:55,824 --> 00:12:57,624
that 'mo was mastering the fine art

269
00:12:57,658 --> 00:13:00,225
of cot wrestling
with his cell mate.

270
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:05,696
Must have sucked being the
Detroit Lions of wrestling.

271
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,131
Huh, Red Scare ?

272
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:09,500
I was a good wrestler.

273
00:13:09,534 --> 00:13:12,469
No one did the Russian like me.

274
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:14,438
Too bad you couldn't
be as good a criminal.

275
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:15,839
Rap sheet a mile long.

276
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:17,274
Always getting pinched.

277
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:19,042
You steal that ?

278
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:21,743
Doesn't look familiar.

279
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:24,512
- That's not what Bear says.
- I don't know a Bear.

280
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:27,081
How about a Machine ?

281
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:29,316
You know Mick Malone ?

282
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,318
Nope.

283
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,587
Then you must have hit
your head pretty good

284
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:35,922
when he slammed you to the
ground like a rag doll.

285
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:39,325
What's your point with all this ?

286
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,028
We'll go slow,

287
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,029
so try to keep up.

288
00:13:43,263 --> 00:13:46,732
This .44 is the gun
that killed Mick.

289
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:50,034
If you don't talk,
slap the gun theft on you,

290
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:52,537
you got another seven years.

291
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:54,305
Even more for Mick's murder.

292
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:01,746
Well, hypothetically,
if I'd taken Bear's gun,

293
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,181
imagine it had some worth,

294
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:05,916
so I wouldn't have kept
it more than a few weeks.

295
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:07,586
Hypothetically,

296
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:09,587
what might you have done with it ?

297
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,987
Traded it for some stuff.

298
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:12,187
What kind of stuff ?

299
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:14,956
Well, steroids, hypothetically.

300
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,825
And I'd have sent it to this guy,
Sil Tavern,

301
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:19,126
known for the good juice.

302
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,394
Sent ?

303
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:21,795
Like, in the mail ?

304
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:23,563
Might have been in
Tampa at the time.

305
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,668
All right, you sent a gun

306
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:28,469
through the mail ?

307
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,704
Hypothetically.

308
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,142
But I made him sign for it.

309
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:36,910
I ain't stupid.

310
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:38,545
Bottom line...

311
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,014
I didn't have that gun, Sil did.

312
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,700
Ooh, that's a good one.

313
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,270
Thanks. I appreciate it, guys.

314
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,105
"Sweet" Sil Tavern.

315
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,772
I saw you wrestle when I was a kid.

316
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:15,340
Yeah, well, this is just temporary.
I'll be back in the ring soon.

317
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,575
All right, pic,
two for ten, both of you.

318
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:18,942
Maybe later.

319
00:15:20,944 --> 00:15:23,178
You ever own a .44 Magnum ?

320
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,747
I used to work security,

321
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:26,715
but I never needed
a piece like that.

322
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:30,117
Well, took us forever
to find this stupid tracking slip

323
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:31,452
and now you're going to lie ?

324
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:35,021
It's a .44 Magnum.
Sent from Nate Beecher.

325
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:36,990
It's the gun that
killed Mick Malone.

326
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:38,158
Mick Malone.

327
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:39,926
We were good friends.

328
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,195
The more we beat each other up,
the closer we got.

329
00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:46,832
Rivalry ever spill outside the ring ?

330
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:49,800
No way.
We had a great thing going.

331
00:15:49,835 --> 00:15:50,868
You know, Lance worked it all out.

332
00:15:50,902 --> 00:15:52,902
We were the perfect
baby-face/heel combination.

333
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:54,270
So what about the gun ?

334
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:56,873
I got it from Nate,
but I sold it right after.

335
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,074
To who ?

336
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:00,542
Well, to Mick actually.

337
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:04,777
So you just happened to sell it
to the dead guy ?

338
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:06,013
Yeah.

339
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:08,847
I didn't need it.
I gave him a deal on it.

340
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:12,149
Mick said something about
doing side jobs,

341
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,750
extra cash,

342
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:15,117
- like that.
- Debt collecting ?

343
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:16,184
Maybe.

344
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:18,152
Indies don't pay much.

345
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,053
Mick was just trying to
take care of his son.

346
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:22,157
Did whatever it
took for his family.

347
00:16:22,392 --> 00:16:24,762
<i>"Play Dirty" by Poison.</i>

348
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,332
It's our first garbage match

349
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,733
so we're gonna need to sell it, okay ?

350
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:29,569
Sil is going to get a
club with barbed wire

351
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:30,771
out from under the ring.

352
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:32,106
Barbed wire ?

353
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:33,542
Okay, Mick,
you wince with every shot.

354
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,645
You're in pain.

355
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,448
But the moment you duck,
the tides are turned.

356
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:37,985
You hit Sil and he drops the club.

357
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:40,354
I don't see what we need
all this garbage stuff for.

358
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:42,055
I'm tired of people
saying we're fake.

359
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,058
Okay, they want real,
we'll give 'em real.

360
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:46,760
We'll blow the WWF out
of the freakin' water.

361
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:49,396
I told my kid I'd bring
him to the match tonight.

362
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:51,232
Watch his old man win the belt.

363
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:52,233
So ?

364
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:54,902
So I don't want my kid see me
all cut up with barbed wire.

365
00:16:55,136 --> 00:16:57,838
Well, I guess you'll bring him
to a different match, won't you ?

366
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:02,510
Look, don't tell me
what to do with my kid.

367
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:04,946
- You want to wrestle or not ?
- Hey, hey, guys.

368
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:07,015
We're cool.

369
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:10,552
Lance, you know,
I was talking about
the TV deal.

370
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:12,553
This feud will get it.

371
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:15,587
And, Mick, your kid, right ?

372
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:17,956
Do some garbage.

373
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,391
This works out,
you can quit the docks.

374
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:22,227
Get him whatever he wants.

375
00:17:24,196 --> 00:17:25,430
Fine.

376
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:28,533
All right. All right.

377
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,401
Take that adrenaline
into the ring, huh?

378
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:36,605
Just...

379
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,141
with the club, hit me in the
back instead of the face.

380
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:41,909
Yeah, yeah, man, no problem.

381
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:49,615
I get what Mick was going through,

382
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:51,014
trying to be a good dad.

383
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:52,781
I got a son, too.

384
00:17:53,514 --> 00:17:55,313
I'd do anything for him.

385
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:57,772
Mick and Lance butt heads often ?

386
00:17:57,907 --> 00:17:59,404
Don't see why they would have.

387
00:17:59,638 --> 00:18:01,636
We all got our TV
deal right after that,

388
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:03,171
and everybody was happy.

389
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:05,306
Do you remember where you
were when Mick got shot ?

390
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,009
Yeah. Um...
I was out with the boys.

391
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,210
We had a card that night.

392
00:18:09,243 --> 00:18:10,710
You got any names ?

393
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:12,512
I'm sure I could drum 'em up.

394
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:14,614
Well, you're gonna have to
come with us till you do.

395
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:16,048
Look,

396
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,917
could it not be here
in front of the fans ?

397
00:18:19,151 --> 00:18:21,019
Only got a few minutes left.

398
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:24,121
Sorry, Sil. Let's go.

399
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:26,257
Oh, come on.

400
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:30,027
Talked to Sapphire
from the Traffic Light.

401
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:32,428
Broke up with Bear in '82.

402
00:18:32,462 --> 00:18:33,929
Well, the guy was
only four years off.

403
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:35,798
Ain't the only thing
he was off about.

404
00:18:35,832 --> 00:18:38,465
Turns out, he and Mick
collected debts together

405
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:39,999
for the Longshoremen.

406
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:42,035
Any info on that traveling gun ?

407
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,937
I found who donated it
to Guns for Groceries

408
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:46,439
off surveillance at
the grocery store.

409
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:47,873
Jordan Pope.

410
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:50,141
Lived in Alaska
through June of '86.

411
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:51,609
He couldn't be our doer then.

412
00:18:51,643 --> 00:18:54,944
Said he found the gun in
Juniata Park, fall of '86,

413
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:56,845
a few months after the murder.

414
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,224
You okay, Belen ?

415
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:12,258
What's wrong ?

416
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:13,794
I saw him.

417
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:18,065
Have a seat.

418
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,503
The scum who assaulted you ?

419
00:19:24,737 --> 00:19:25,937
Where ?

420
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:30,342
He was mowing a lawn
in my neighborhood.

421
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:26,533
I called the police.

422
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:29,836
They're already here.

423
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:41,819
Morning.

424
00:21:46,823 --> 00:21:48,858
What happened, Scotty ?

425
00:21:51,461 --> 00:21:52,696
I had to...

426
00:21:52,997 --> 00:21:54,197
make an arrest.

427
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,866
Guy put up a little resistance.

428
00:21:57,201 --> 00:21:58,768
Everything on the up-and-up ?

429
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:00,537
Oh, yeah.

430
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:02,072
Yeah, no worries.

431
00:22:02,106 --> 00:22:03,640
Go get checked out, cleaned up

432
00:22:03,674 --> 00:22:05,274
and we'll talk about it later on.

433
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:06,442
Sure thing.

434
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:07,709
Now, Scotty.

435
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:22,753
Hey. You okay ?

436
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:24,955
You should see the other guy.

437
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:28,391
This have to do with, um... ?

438
00:22:29,392 --> 00:22:30,592
You get him ?

439
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:31,993
Yeah.

440
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,333
You forgot to mention

441
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:39,334
that you and Mick worked together--

442
00:22:39,368 --> 00:22:40,802
muscle for the union.

443
00:22:40,836 --> 00:22:42,570
Makes me look bad.

444
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,639
Well, not as bad as your
alibi going south, Bear.

445
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:48,642
Sapphire dumped you way before '86.

446
00:22:48,676 --> 00:22:49,909
What difference does it make ?

447
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:52,311
Didn't you find the Red Scare ?

448
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:54,146
It was your gun.

449
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:56,649
You and Mick collecting debts.

450
00:22:57,383 --> 00:22:58,918
Where did it go wrong ?

451
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:02,154
The night Mick was killed...

452
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:07,925
Check Spank-Me Escorts.

453
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,860
Okay.

454
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:12,129
Mick looked out for me.

455
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:13,564
Got me the job wrestling.

456
00:23:13,598 --> 00:23:14,566
But...

457
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:17,467
his troubles went beyond the mat.

458
00:23:19,168 --> 00:23:20,769
I told you what happened.

459
00:23:20,803 --> 00:23:23,071
What kind of a person does that ?
You bastard !

460
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:24,272
Why, because I want Timmy

461
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:26,074
to see his dad good at something ?

462
00:23:26,108 --> 00:23:28,675
- Last time you'll see him at all.
- No, no.

463
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,244
- You're not taking him away from me.
- We'll see about that.

464
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:33,479
Timmy...

465
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:36,247
Timmy, I'm fine, okay ?

466
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:37,214
I'm fine, buddy.

467
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,282
Hey, it's all pretend.

468
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,416
I'll see you soon.

469
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,751
Okay ? I'll see you soon.

470
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:43,218
Rachel...

471
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,026
What was the fight about ?

472
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,294
No idea.

473
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:55,896
But if Mick's ex thought
he'd give up his kid,

474
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,564
she had another thing coming.

475
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,200
Just spent an exhilarating time

476
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:02,668
down at family court.

477
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:04,637
Yeah, you bond with
the city workers ?

478
00:24:04,672 --> 00:24:08,440
Rachel filed for sole custody
four days before Mick's murder.

479
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:12,076
Said Mick hung around
some unsavory folk.

480
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,111
Wrestlers or dockworkers ?

481
00:24:14,145 --> 00:24:15,311
She also claims

482
00:24:15,346 --> 00:24:18,080
Mick abandoned Tim in a
warehouse in Baltimore

483
00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:19,881
the night of his last match.

484
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:21,382
All right, let's get her in here.

485
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:23,684
- Miller's picking her up now.
- Yeah, Tim, too.

486
00:24:23,718 --> 00:24:26,085
See what was going
on in that family.

487
00:24:32,623 --> 00:24:34,357
Hey, Valens around ?

488
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,292
Um, no.

489
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:37,659
I'm his partner.

490
00:24:37,694 --> 00:24:39,594
You're from Central, right ?

491
00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:40,963
Yeah. Detective Pierson.

492
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:43,037
Saw you did the search warrant

493
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:45,006
after Scotty made that
arrest last night.

494
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,840
Yeah, my case initially.

495
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:48,775
Guess Detective Valens had a beat,

496
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:51,077
went to the scumbag's place,
nobody answered.

497
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:52,544
But, you know,

498
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:55,047
the door was already ajar.

499
00:24:55,081 --> 00:24:57,582
He heard some noises,
went in to investigate

500
00:24:57,617 --> 00:24:59,217
and found the ID's.

501
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:02,319
Yeah, yeah, that's what I figured.

502
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:06,389
What went wrong, Rachel ?

503
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:09,258
We had Tim young.

504
00:25:09,293 --> 00:25:10,727
Drifted apart.

505
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,161
Mick violent with you guys ?

506
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:13,462
No.

507
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:15,230
He just had no clue

508
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,733
what being a real father was.

509
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,501
- What do you mean ?
- Well,

510
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:19,969
his father was up in Graterford.

511
00:25:20,004 --> 00:25:21,804
I guess he realized

512
00:25:21,838 --> 00:25:24,172
that he was heading down
the same path with Tim,

513
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,708
not really being a father.

514
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:28,142
Tried to turn it around.

515
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:30,676
That's not what you thought
when you filed for sole custody.

516
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:32,111
You said

517
00:25:33,146 --> 00:25:36,415
that he got Tim out of school,
took him to Baltimore,

518
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,783
then left him there.

519
00:25:37,817 --> 00:25:39,984
It took me two hours

520
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:42,053
to drive up there and get him.

521
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:44,721
I found him in a warehouse.

522
00:25:44,956 --> 00:25:46,423
All by himself.

523
00:25:47,457 --> 00:25:48,658
Mick tell you what happened ?

524
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:51,928
He said he got hurt in the match.

525
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:54,931
But unless you're dead...

526
00:25:54,965 --> 00:25:56,966
It's no excuse, right ?

527
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,469
That's a lot of time and money

528
00:25:59,503 --> 00:26:02,171
to get sole custody.

529
00:26:03,205 --> 00:26:05,508
Enough to make you want to take
matters into your own hands ?

530
00:26:05,642 --> 00:26:07,343
I was working the
night Mick was killed.

531
00:26:07,477 --> 00:26:09,044
- Check it out.
- I did.

532
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,979
You took a two-hour break.

533
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:13,081
Right around the
time Mick was shot.

534
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:15,717
I snuck off to see my son.

535
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:19,354
He was in the hospital.

536
00:26:19,388 --> 00:26:20,388
For a broken arm.

537
00:26:21,223 --> 00:26:23,959
Broken arm ?
Who told you that ?

538
00:26:23,993 --> 00:26:26,962
He was in a coma for five days.

539
00:26:26,996 --> 00:26:28,430
A coma ?

540
00:26:29,364 --> 00:26:30,599
Why ?

541
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:32,667
Look, Ma had nothing
to do with it, okay ?

542
00:26:32,701 --> 00:26:34,902
You see her tell your dad
to stay away from you ?

543
00:26:34,936 --> 00:26:36,804
So people argue, you know ?

544
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:38,072
So what ?

545
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:40,241
It's not exactly the image
you painted earlier.

546
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:43,010
You never said she
filed for sole custody.

547
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:45,445
Sole custody ?

548
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,846
I didn't know that.

549
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,948
What happened when he left
you alone in that warehouse ?

550
00:26:51,682 --> 00:26:55,152
Look, I was just trying to wrap
my head around it all, okay ?

551
00:26:55,186 --> 00:26:56,286
Around what ?

552
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,855
My dad told me it was all fake.

553
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:04,357
<i>"Rock You Like a Hurricane"
by Scorpions.</i>

554
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:16,270
Machine! Machine!

555
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:18,905
Machine! Machine! Machine!

556
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,684
Machine! Machine!

557
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,230
He's going for the belt.

558
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:54,434
If he gets there,
he retains the title.

559
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:04,743
Machine! Machine!
Machine! Machine!

560
00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:27,296
The new WIC champion...

561
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,031
"Sweet" Sil Tavern !

562
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,425
Dad...

563
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:07,060
Dad !

564
00:29:08,361 --> 00:29:09,760
Yeah...

565
00:29:10,294 --> 00:29:12,691
I thought he was dead.

566
00:29:13,026 --> 00:29:15,724
Then I saw him at the docks,

567
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,658
and he said he was okay.

568
00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:20,761
It was all just pretend.

569
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:22,863
I-I tried to tell him that...

570
00:29:23,997 --> 00:29:26,866
sometimes people get hurt.

571
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,636
We got in an argument about it.

572
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,871
When ?

573
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:34,572
After seeing Mick at the docks.

574
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,241
The night Tim went to the hospital ?

575
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,508
Yeah.

576
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,543
He couldn't understand

577
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:43,079
why his father would tell him
something that wasn't true.

578
00:29:43,813 --> 00:29:45,381
And he, um,

579
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:47,183
he went to his room and...

580
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:51,986
Then I heard it...

581
00:29:54,088 --> 00:29:56,489
...footsteps on the roof.

582
00:29:57,424 --> 00:29:58,590
Timmy ?

583
00:29:58,825 --> 00:30:00,359
Tim!

584
00:30:05,196 --> 00:30:06,631
I...

585
00:30:09,066 --> 00:30:11,433
I shouldn't have fought so
hard to keep them apart,

586
00:30:11,468 --> 00:30:12,935
you know ?

587
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:16,337
I mean, maybe if...

588
00:30:16,671 --> 00:30:19,406
if Mick could have
talked to him, you know ?

589
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:22,842
He just...

590
00:30:24,376 --> 00:30:27,011
He wanted to be like his dad.

591
00:30:30,381 --> 00:30:32,814
Found the video from
Mick's last match.

592
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:39,253
If Mick knew that stunt was coming,

593
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:41,254
would he have brought
his kid to that match ?

594
00:30:41,288 --> 00:30:44,557
He spent 12 hours in the E.
R. after that fall.

595
00:30:44,691 --> 00:30:46,626
"Acute axial compression."

596
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,462
It's when the vertebrae
mash together, right ?

597
00:30:49,497 --> 00:30:50,997
Could have been paralyzed for life.

598
00:30:51,031 --> 00:30:52,498
Now check this out.

599
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:54,233
Right after the match...

600
00:30:56,403 --> 00:30:58,203
<i>Get that out of my face.</i>

601
00:31:00,572 --> 00:31:02,772
<i>I ain't gonna tell you again.</i>

602
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,307
Oh. It's a .44 Magnum.

603
00:31:04,441 --> 00:31:07,243
Sold it to Mick, my ass.
Sil had it the whole time.

604
00:31:07,478 --> 00:31:09,245
Let's get him out from holding.

605
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,746
Lance, too.

606
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,913
He forgot to mention

607
00:31:11,948 --> 00:31:15,183
his star wrestler
nearly broke his neck.

608
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:17,752
Scotty.

609
00:31:27,327 --> 00:31:29,995
Pierson found this
under the radiator.

610
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:39,872
He didn't want it to get
mixed up in the reports.

611
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:44,977
Anything you need on this,
Scotty, whatever it is...

612
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:47,278
you got it.

613
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:51,350
Thanks, Lil.

614
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:02,388
Out with the boys

615
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:04,589
when Mick died, hmm ?

616
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,657
The names you gave us...

617
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,360
Well, one's in Japan and
the rest are all dead.

618
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,462
In our business, if you make it to 50,

619
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:12,663
you're a survivor.

620
00:32:12,696 --> 00:32:15,632
Well, Mick didn't make it to 30.
When did you sell him that .44 again ?

621
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:17,133
A couple months before he died.

622
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:21,736
<i>Get that out of my face.</i>

623
00:32:24,939 --> 00:32:26,706
<i>I ain't gonna tell you again.</i>

624
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,074
Match was from ten days
before Mick was killed.

625
00:32:29,108 --> 00:32:31,175
Right after you threw
him off a scaffold.

626
00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:33,110
I must have sold it to
him later than I thought.

627
00:32:33,144 --> 00:32:34,211
Don't lie to me, Sil.

628
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:37,113
If Mick's gone, you stay champion.

629
00:32:37,147 --> 00:32:39,915
I didn't kill him.

630
00:32:39,949 --> 00:32:42,416
You got no problem throwing him
on his head from 20 feet up.

631
00:32:42,451 --> 00:32:44,517
Your idea to go off script ?

632
00:32:44,552 --> 00:32:46,186
- No.
- Lance's ?

633
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,520
- No. I mean...
- You mean what ?

634
00:32:47,555 --> 00:32:48,722
I didn't go off script.

635
00:32:48,957 --> 00:32:50,292
So Mick brings his kid

636
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:52,961
to the one match that
he's supposed to lose ?

637
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:54,830
That was an accident.

638
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:57,399
We got Lance in the next room.

639
00:32:59,534 --> 00:33:01,470
Any bets he'll throw
you under the bus ?

640
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:04,672
What do I care if Sil's
in the other room ?

641
00:33:04,706 --> 00:33:06,940
This has nothing to do with me.

642
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:09,176
God, you're wasting your time here.

643
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,311
Trust me, there's a
lot I'd rather do

644
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:13,247
than talk to you, ass-clown.

645
00:33:13,482 --> 00:33:15,182
Ass-clown ?

646
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:16,686
Who in this room

647
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:19,887
owns a multimillion-dollar empire ?

648
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:22,622
Raise that hand again
you'll lower a stub.

649
00:33:23,057 --> 00:33:24,157
FYI...

650
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:27,026
the WIC attorney's been notified,
for Sil as well.

651
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,727
We'll let you know when he call.

652
00:33:28,728 --> 00:33:31,262
Why do you need a lawyer ?
You have something to hide ?

653
00:33:31,296 --> 00:33:32,665
Its my right, Detective.

654
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:36,299
Saw a tape of Mick flying
through that table.

655
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:39,201
- It a cool stunt.
- Yeah, first of many.

656
00:33:39,236 --> 00:33:40,837
You get your TV deal
after that match ?

657
00:33:40,871 --> 00:33:42,372
I sure did.

658
00:33:42,406 --> 00:33:44,739
So really, everything you got

659
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:46,140
is because of Sil.

660
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:47,141
Excuse me ?

661
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:49,343
Sil was a genius.

662
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:50,678
It was his idea, right ?

663
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:52,279
Throwing Mick off that scaffold ?

664
00:33:52,313 --> 00:33:55,581
Ideas don't happen unless
they come from my brain.

665
00:33:55,615 --> 00:33:57,151
I am the WIC.

666
00:33:57,185 --> 00:34:00,854
You seem like a leech
promoter to me.

667
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:03,857
Every move, every grunt,
every punch in that ring--

668
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:04,692
that's me.

669
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:07,129
I create everything.

670
00:34:07,897 --> 00:34:09,697
Including Mick's fall ?

671
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:15,636
Something funny ?

672
00:34:15,671 --> 00:34:17,471
I can't believe I
almost fell for that.

673
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:19,005
The good cop, bad cop.

674
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,207
You two ought to be
tag team partners.

675
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:23,208
Mick must have been real pissed

676
00:34:23,243 --> 00:34:25,613
about that fall you created.

677
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:28,115
He come talk to you after
he could walk again ?

678
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:30,985
I think I'm just going
to wait for my lawyer.

679
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:32,687
Is that okay with you ?

680
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,190
Lawyer for the WIC.

681
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:40,528
You can't rep Lance and Sil.
Pick one.

682
00:34:40,562 --> 00:34:41,929
Lance.

683
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:43,831
How do I know you're a lawyer ?

684
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:45,433
You could be anybody.

685
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:48,535
Doing some digging on Sil.

686
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:49,902
Anything I could find.

687
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:51,136
No felonies, but...

688
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,402
a fender bender.

689
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:54,036
20 minutes after Mick's murder.

690
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,370
Check out the location.

691
00:34:55,404 --> 00:34:56,837
Wyoming Avenue.

692
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:59,139
That's right near Juniata Park.

693
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:01,638
That's, what, about ten
minutes from the docks ?

694
00:35:01,672 --> 00:35:03,472
Sil had a passenger with him.

695
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:05,406
Guess who ?

696
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,141
They were together

697
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:09,309
the night Mick was murdered ?

698
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:10,977
So who pulled the trigger ?

699
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:12,710
Lawyers are on their way.

700
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,678
Got about ten minutes
to figure it out.

701
00:35:15,212 --> 00:35:17,280
You ever been to Juniata Park, Sil ?

702
00:35:19,014 --> 00:35:20,849
It's not a...
not a trick question.

703
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:22,951
It's just that you were
in an accident out there

704
00:35:22,985 --> 00:35:24,552
the night that Mick was killed.

705
00:35:25,186 --> 00:35:26,719
Why were you with Lance ?

706
00:35:27,687 --> 00:35:29,186
Mick was your friend.

707
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:31,818
You're both single parents

708
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:35,288
doing whatever it took to
take care of your kids.

709
00:35:35,422 --> 00:35:38,022
We had a lot in common.

710
00:35:38,057 --> 00:35:39,924
Yeah, that's strange,
'cause that isn't what Adam said.

711
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:41,825
Your son.

712
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:44,059
Yeah, I tracked him down.

713
00:35:44,093 --> 00:35:45,826
You haven't seen him
in a while, huh ?

714
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:48,028
I see him when I can.

715
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,696
Every 15 years ?

716
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,598
You must not try very hard.
I mean, he's right here in Philly.

717
00:35:52,632 --> 00:35:54,499
I'd do anything for my son.

718
00:35:55,234 --> 00:35:56,969
Except stick around.

719
00:35:57,603 --> 00:36:01,076
See, you preach about family,

720
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:06,046
but it's Mick who was the one
who was trying to be a good dad.

721
00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:12,084
Don't you think his son deserves
to know what happened to him ?

722
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:17,856
I went to see Mick that night.

723
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,057
Where ? At the docks ?

724
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:22,326
I heard what happened
to his kid.

725
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:25,061
I went to the hospital.

726
00:36:25,664 --> 00:36:26,797
With Lance ?

727
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:27,900
No.

728
00:36:29,001 --> 00:36:30,001
 Alone.

729
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:32,302
I told him that

730
00:36:32,336 --> 00:36:35,204
I was sorry for the match...

731
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:37,273
for hurting him.

732
00:36:37,307 --> 00:36:38,907
But that Lance was going

733
00:36:38,942 --> 00:36:41,176
to promote the hell
out of the rematch.

734
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:43,178
We'd both get rich, you know ?

735
00:36:43,213 --> 00:36:46,581
So, you leave the hospital
and Mick's still alive ?

736
00:36:46,615 --> 00:36:48,950
Then you hook up with Lance...

737
00:36:48,984 --> 00:36:50,585
he's dead.

738
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:52,453
Lance gave me my career.

739
00:36:52,487 --> 00:36:54,188
Without Lance I'd be nothing.

740
00:36:54,222 --> 00:36:56,423
You're living off of
ten dollar autographs.

741
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:58,792
He's going to get me
back in the ring soon.

742
00:36:59,526 --> 00:37:02,729
I'm only one match away
from being on top again.

743
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:07,567
When are you going to wake up
from the spell of that guy, Sil ?

744
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,503
Lawyer call yet ?

745
00:37:10,537 --> 00:37:11,604
Not yet.

746
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,639
In the meantime,
thought you could tell us

747
00:37:13,673 --> 00:37:16,008
what you were doing in
Sil's car in Juniata Park

748
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:17,475
the night Mick was killed.

749
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,678
I'm sure my attorney
would love to do it.

750
00:37:19,912 --> 00:37:22,079
Why don't you go fetch
him for me, ese.

751
00:37:24,816 --> 00:37:26,751
Good cop, get out.

752
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:29,087
Wait, wait, where you going ?

753
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:31,156
See if your lawyer called.

754
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,757
Whoa, wait a minute !

755
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,626
Look, I didn't mean all that.

756
00:37:36,831 --> 00:37:39,362
Brought an associate
to represent Sil.

757
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:41,059
Got it.

758
00:37:41,794 --> 00:37:43,390
They're both in the lobby.

759
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:45,654
Now ?

760
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:50,983
Pinstripe suits, red tie.

761
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:52,815
Okay, got it.

762
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,414
Um, just sit tight,

763
00:37:55,448 --> 00:37:58,982
and let me see if I can get
somebody to go down and get you.

764
00:38:02,852 --> 00:38:05,286
- Somebody get me out of here !
- Any more comments, tough guy ?

765
00:38:05,321 --> 00:38:07,020
Cat got your tongue ?

766
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:10,521
................

767
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:17,028
You know, I'm gonna
get a soda. Want one ?

768
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,730
Yeah.

769
00:38:20,566 --> 00:38:21,899
Hey, Lance.

770
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,702
- Let's take a walk.
- Okay.

771
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:30,705
That guy is loco.

772
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:33,874
Tell me about it.
It's that Latin temper.

773
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:35,508
Yeah, yeah.

774
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,623
So it looks like he beat you to it.

775
00:38:51,657 --> 00:38:53,725
"Sil came and picked me up.

776
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:56,027
He told me he shot
Mick by the docks."

777
00:38:56,762 --> 00:38:58,797
That's Lance's signature, right ?

778
00:39:01,603 --> 00:39:03,272
But that's a lie.

779
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:05,207
Then what's the truth, Sil ?

780
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:08,576
Okay, Sil, get up.

781
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:10,045
No. No.

782
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,348
I talked to the D.A.

783
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,015
Your car, your gun.

784
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,084
Take a jury 20 minutes
to convict you.

785
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:16,419
It was Lance.

786
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:19,056
Lance told me that Mick
had agreed

787
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,057
to do the stunt.

788
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,424
But he didn't.

789
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:23,526
Mick said if Lance wanted him

790
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,329
to get back in the ring,
he could come tell him himself.

791
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:27,463
You tell Lance that ?

792
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,101
I told him...

793
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:33,842
...that Mick wanted
to be with his kid.

794
00:39:36,576 --> 00:39:38,478
His son was in a coma.

795
00:39:39,112 --> 00:39:40,713
But Lance didn't care.

796
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:43,882
And you went along
with whatever Lance said.

797
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:45,417
We all did.

798
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:47,552
Except for Mick.

799
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,490
That's what pissed
Lance off the most.

800
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,026
Next time I tell you
to do something,

801
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,561
you better damn well do it.

802
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,195
Can't do anything
without you telling me.

803
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,365
You know why ?
'Cause that's how I want it.

804
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:07,402
Now where's that gun ?

805
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:29,787
What the hell is your problem ?

806
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,724
I finally bring my kid to a match,

807
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:38,025
and you throw me through a table ?

808
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:39,860
Last I checked, I make the rules.

809
00:40:39,894 --> 00:40:41,060
Not for me.

810
00:40:41,095 --> 00:40:42,561
I'm done dancing to your tune.

811
00:40:42,596 --> 00:40:45,063
Okay, okay, you're pissed
that your kid saw you lose.

812
00:40:45,098 --> 00:40:47,064
Fine. Okay,
bring him to the next one.

813
00:40:47,098 --> 00:40:48,432
It'll be the best
match he's ever seen.

814
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:49,966
You will be the champion for
the next two years.

815
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:50,967
No, thanks.

816
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:52,935
You leave when I ring the bell.
You got that?

817
00:40:54,637 --> 00:40:56,804
We just got the TV deal, okay ?

818
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:59,339
Do you know how much money
we are going to make on the next match ?

819
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,573
Clean the crap out of your ears.

820
00:41:01,608 --> 00:41:02,907
I'm done !

821
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:05,109
Just can't handle it, is that it ?

822
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:06,676
You'd rather be out here

823
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:08,411
unloading cargo and busting thumbs ?

824
00:41:08,645 --> 00:41:10,279
No more debt collecting.

825
00:41:10,413 --> 00:41:11,913
All aboveboard now.

826
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:14,081
Oh, well, I'm sure
your kid's real proud

827
00:41:14,115 --> 00:41:17,083
to have a punk loser for a dad.

828
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:20,818
See what it feels like
every night in the ring.

829
00:41:52,642 --> 00:41:56,717
<i>"Wanted Dead or Alive"
