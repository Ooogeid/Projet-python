1
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,300
I'd like an application
for club membership.

2
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,865
2432 to despatch..

3
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,000
requires immediate medical
assistance for a female victim

4
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:23,865
Gun shot wound to the head

5
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,100
And at the intersection
of 50 college...

6
00:01:27,135 --> 00:01:27,900
Hurry.

7
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,365
Ms. Rush? Lilly?

8
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
Is there someone we should contact?

9
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,900
you under the weather, lil?

10
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,300
I was up late.

11
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Paperwork.

12
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,200
why are we here?

13
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,300
The me wants us to take
a look at a jane doe.

14
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,265
They just find the body?

15
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,000
A guest of st. Michael's hospital.

16
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:38,765
18 years on the city dime.

17
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
Well, how's that
make her a homicide?

18
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:41,700
She died last night.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,300
Back in '89, she got caught
on the wrong side of town,

20
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:45,565
the wrong end of a gun.

21
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,900
Me says death's a result of
the bullet wound to her head.

22
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,265
Meaning jane doe's
our jurisdiction.

23
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,400
Original theory is she's a
transient, some kind of altercation.

24
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,765
Anything new?

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,365
Just a mysterious admirer.

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Leaves a care package every month.

27
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:01,400
Champagne, caviar,
godiva chocolate.

28
00:03:01,435 --> 00:03:02,765
Some care package.

29
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,365
Yeah, not that jane doe noticed.

30
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Been in one of those persistent
vegetative states since the shooting.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,500
Trapped inside her own mind.

32
00:03:09,535 --> 00:03:11,500
Damn. What a way to go.

33
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,200
Counselor thomas. They let you
across the street in daylight?

34
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:16,365
Prepping testimony.

35
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,300
Some of these medical
types need coddling.

36
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,000
And they send you?

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,565
That's funny.

38
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,800
And with that
ringing endorsement...

39
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,500
don't be so sensitive.

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,100
I should go.

41
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm glad to see
you back on the job.

42
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:33,100
Thanks.

43
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,200
Lieutenant.

44
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:36,500
Detective.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And ithought the cold war was over.

46
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,900
What a you talking about?

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,100
Only thing you didn't
do was pull her pigtails.

48
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:46,100
Ah.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll meet you inside.

50
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:48,800
Hmm?

51
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,900
This woman suffered a cerebral
hemorrhage, resulting in a massive stroke.

52
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,800
Bullet fragments dormant in the
brain accelerated the process.

53
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,300
You saying almost 20 years dying
in a hospital bed is accelerated?

54
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:16,100
I'm saying the bullet
killed your victim.

55
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,500
Just took some time doing it.

56
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:18,700
Yeah, this we knew.

57
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,200
Got something else?

58
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,500
As I was saying before you decided
to honor us with your presence,

59
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,000
I believe I do.

60
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,300
What are we looking at?

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,100
Saline breast implants.

62
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,065
Circa 1989.

63
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,265
Uncommon back then?

64
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,500
Well, most of the industry
still used silicone.

65
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:37,700
This was rare.

66
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,100
So, these things expensive?

67
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah.

68
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,900
Must have spent about
ten grand on these.

69
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,500
A lot of money to
spend on yourself.

70
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:47,800
Woman was no transient.

71
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,800
Means someone out there
should be missing her.

72
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,600
That or they're glad
she's finally dead.

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,965
jane doe, mid-30s,

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,600
found in the
badlands, shot in the face.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,065
Well, cops back then
figured she was homeless.

76
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,800
Thinking now, rich girl
gets robbed for her cartier.

77
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:40,865
Puts up a fight.

78
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,800
Ballistics can't get much
on the bullet fragments.

79
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:43,965
Probably a nine-millimeter.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,965
Hmm. Well, that narrows it down.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
Only witness seems to
be the victim herself.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,400
Leaves us with one
photo to identify her.

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,700
And half her face is gone.

84
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,000
Well, that's where
18 years helps us.

85
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,000
Computer-generated renderings of what
jane doe looked like before she was shot.

86
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:03,200
We're circulating them to missing
persons bureaus across the country.

87
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,300
Pretty lady.

88
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,000
Got something.

89
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,365
Serial number on the saline

90
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,600
pouches traced back to
a dr. Jeremy fincher.

91
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,465
Plastic surgeon out of
cherry hill, new jersey.

92
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,600
Oh, bring him in. Let's see
what the doctor remembers.

93
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,100
This is margot chambers.

94
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:23,200
From the club.

95
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,700
We used to mingle on the 19th hole.

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,900
19th hole.

97
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
That in cherry hill?

98
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,500
It's anywhere my friends
johnny and walker reside.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,765
Gotcha.

100
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,300
Margot came to the club,

101
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:36,567
I don't know,

102
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:37,800
winter of '89.

103
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,100
Left six months later.

104
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,400
You two close?

105
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,665
I wouldn't call it that.

106
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,700
She came in for
breast augmentation.

107
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,000
I thought it was strange.

108
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,100
Why is that?

109
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,000
Margot had a classic beauty
most women would have envied.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She was...

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,450
she was exquisite, really. Hmm.

112
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:58,492
Sounds like you were fond of her.

113
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:00,465
I didn't see the need for the work,

114
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,900
but margot had a way
of convincing people.

115
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Any idea why she was so insistent?

116
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:06,200
She didn't say.

117
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,565
But a couple weeks
after the procedure,

118
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,700
I realized she was competing
in a different league.

119
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,500
And country club women play dirty.

120
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,400
You're staring at
my breasts, jeremy.

121
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:34,200
Just admiring the craftsmanship.

122
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:35,617
Yes, you do good work.

123
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:36,965
You made it easy, margot.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,100
I feel ashamed to even
accept money for it.

125
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,165
That's okay.

126
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,600
I don't intend to pay.

127
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,265
hi, margot.

128
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't "hi, margot"
me, you little hussy.

129
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,665
Excuse me.

130
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,600
Your husband aware you're a
full-service operation, dear?

131
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:12,500
Ms. Chambers, I think
you've had too much to drink.

132
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,265
What's she do for you that I don't?

133
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,750
Huh? What's this
two-piece whore got on me?

134
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:19,200
Listen, I think there's
a misunderstanding.

135
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:21,117
Damn straight there is, sweetheart.

136
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:23,000
You're messing with
private property.

137
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

138
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:26,567
Come closer.

139
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:27,665
I'll be clearer.

140
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,100
Listen, margot, you need to stop.

141
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:30,500
You're making a fool of yourself.

142
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:31,965
How can you do this?

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,500
We have something, spencer.

144
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,100
It's over, and you...

145
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,900
let go of me this
instant, or I'll...

146
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,700
what?

147
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,100
What, you'll get me fired?

148
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,900
you've got far more
than a job to lose.

149
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,600
You push me, margot,

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,300
I'll push back.

151
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,665
needless to say,

152
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,500
the pool boy was gone
after that incident.

153
00:08:58,535 --> 00:08:59,965
But margot disappeared, too.

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I
- I always assumed she went to aspen, the hamptons.

155
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:06,600
What about spencer's
hot squeeze, melissa?

156
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
She still around?

157
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,465
Mel? Mel's a fixture.

158
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,600
Her husband practically
owns the club.

159
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,600
Did her mouth last year.

160
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Frown lines.

161
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,500
This won't take long, will it?

162
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,000
Tee time's in 15.

163
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,600
It's about spencer mason.

164
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,600
Young guy worked here
about 18 years ago,

165
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:31,900
cabana boy

166
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,265
Can't pin him down.

167
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,700
Yeah, might be involved in the
shooting of margot chambers.

168
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:36,800
You knew her.

169
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes, but I have no memory of him.

170
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,600
Well, that's kind of funny 'cause
we did a little background on you.

171
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,000
Pulled credit card
records from 1989.

172
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,050
There's a lot of charges:

173
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,500
Marriot, ritz, hilton...

174
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,100
those are hotels, right?

175
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,300
Spencer and I were involved.

176
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,300
A tryst with the pool boy.

177
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,065
More than a tryst.

178
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,000
He was my ticket
away from this place.

179
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,100
Talk about margot and spencer.

180
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,750
He said that dragon lady
had him by the throat.

181
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:06,000
She was blackmailing him
to continue seeing her.

182
00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:07,165
How'd she manage that?

183
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,500
Said if he didn't keep her happy,

184
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:09,900
she'd accuse him of rape.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,400
Turn him in to the cops.

186
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, hell hath no fury.

187
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:15,500
Spencer needed to get away.

188
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,300
He was in trouble.

189
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,500
I was going to save him.

190
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,700
spencer?

191
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,950
Spencer?

192
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:36,700
Shh.

193
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,200
Were you followed?

194
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:39,065
No.

195
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,400
Margot's been
watching my every move.

196
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:41,700
Are you sure you weren't followed?

197
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:42,600
I was careful.

198
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,900
Did you bring the money?

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,500
the dream's almost ours.

200
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,800
You and me, white, jamaican sands...

201
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,900
we're gonna be so happy.

202
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,900
she's here. I thought
you said you were careful.

203
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,200
I was. I...

204
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
what do we do?

205
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,900
I'll take the car, lose
her on the expressway,

206
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:13,865
come back for you.

207
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,765
What'll I do without you?

208
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,200
Baby, there's no telling what
she might do if she sees you.

209
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,265
Hide here.

210
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,400
I'll come back for you.

211
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
hold onto this.

212
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
and be careful.

213
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,600
That's my heart.

214
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,300
I hid in that place for hours.

215
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,500
He took my car, $50, 000 cash.

216
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,800
Played me like the fool I was.

217
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Ever report it?

218
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,900
Told my husband I had
a gambling problem.

219
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,700
Went into therapy for a few months.

220
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,700
Moved on with my life.

221
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,400
Now, if there isn't
anything else...

222
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,600
no. You can go.

223
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,300
This guy's a pro.

224
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,400
Plays the two rich broads
off against each other,

225
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:11,400
comes out clean.

226
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,900
Not so clean,

227
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,400
if margot caught up with
him a few weeks later.

228
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,000
They mix it up.

229
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,900
And he took more than her money.

230
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,600
You turned me in
to iad, didn't you?

231
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,600
Your charm never ceases to amaze.

232
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,000
Not even denying it?

233
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,565
Unbelievable.

234
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,200
I got asked a question.

235
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:38,267
Answered honestly.

236
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:39,265
Try it sometime.

237
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,500
Where I come from, we
got an issue with someone,

238
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:42,265
we tell 'em.

239
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,465
Where I come from,

240
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
we don't tolerate screwups.

241
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:46,465
What's your problem?

242
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,400
I could ask you the same thing.

243
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,800
You're pissed I never made a move?

244
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,900
Come on, scotty.

245
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,700
Figured you were smarter than that.

246
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,600
Oh, yeah, you got me
all figured out, huh?

247
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,700
You are nothing if not predictable.

248
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
See that coming?

249
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,000
Go ahead.

250
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,800
Destroy everything.

251
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,065
It's what you're good at.

252
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,600
You got no idea
what I'm capable of.

253
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:16,700
Is that right?

254
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,665
Got a hit off the photo

255
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,100
we're circulating on
margot chambers, boss.

256
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:36,467
Someone step forward?

257
00:13:36,502 --> 00:13:38,501
Well, you could say that.

258
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:40,500
Margot chambers is also

259
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:41,700
margot chandler,

260
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,300
margot keller...

261
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,300
margot kentworth?

262
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,500
Each name comes with its
own social security number,

263
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:52,865
birth certificate
and criminal record.

264
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,300
She has outstanding
warrants in four states:

265
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,900
Fraud, check-kiting,
grand theft...

266
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:00,500
margot's no rich victim.

267
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,950
She's a con artist.

268
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:03,100
Just like spencer.

269
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
In fact...

270
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,200
they were a team.

271
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,600
Well, margot and spencer
had quite a partnership.

272
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:23,500
They spent years
crisscrossing the country

273
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:25,300
running their various scams.

274
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,100
The flop, the flat joint,

275
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:29,100
the sawbuck switch.

276
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,800
You got some kind of secret
past we don't know about, nick?

277
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,700
Just his old uncle vernon.

278
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,465
He knew some things.

279
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,700
Yeah, unfortunately, all
the wrong things.

280
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,700
Well, by the time margot and
spencer ended up back east,

281
00:14:42,735 --> 00:14:44,900
they had their country
club scam going strong.

282
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,300
Spencer roped in the
lonely rich girls,

283
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:48,365
margot scared them.

284
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,500
And they walked away
with a pile of cash.

285
00:14:50,535 --> 00:14:51,600
So what got between them?

286
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,700
Maybe spencer got tired of
doing all the heavy lifting.

287
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,265
Must've been exhausting,

288
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,500
pulling the knock-and-tickle
on all those trophy wives.

289
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,500
Or she was jealous.
Older woman, younger man.

290
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:02,800
Afraid she couldn't
keep his interest.

291
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,065
So how do we find a guy

292
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,465
who changes his name more
often than his underwear?

293
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,300
Figure he's the one who slipped
in and out of margot's hospital.

294
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,900
Left gifts every
month for 18 years.

295
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:13,500
That's some guilty conscience.

296
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,300
Like maybe he'd want to pay
his last respects at her grave.

297
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,500
So we plant an obit.

298
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
"Margot chambers, "

299
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:21,800
blah, blah, blah...

300
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,000
"being buried at
oak pines cemetery. "

301
00:15:24,035 --> 00:15:24,865
Stake it out.

302
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,700
No, not me. Got court.

303
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,700
When?

304
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,800
Whenever the stakeout is.

305
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,765
"Plant an obit, "

306
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,200
she says, "stake it out. "

307
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,200
Yeah.

308
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,600
Day and a half of my
life I'm not getting back.

309
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,500
'Cause I'm so stimulated
sitting next to you?

310
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,600
What in the hell is
the sawbuck switch?

311
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,400
Uh, you got a $20 bill?

312
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,700
You want to see the trick or not?

313
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,465
so I go into a busy tavern

314
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,700
and I order a beer waving this 20.

315
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,800
You pour my suds,

316
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,700
and give me change for the 20

317
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,700
instead of the ten
I actually gave you.

318
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,700
Got a car coming.

319
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,700
Spencer mason?

320
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
He's rabbiting.

321
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's tough.

322
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,100
Losing someone close.

323
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,300
I'm certain wherever she is,

324
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,300
she's glad you came.

325
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,000
Don't be too sure.

326
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,500
My husband.

327
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
Sometimes I feel responsible.

328
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,400
You know?

329
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,900
You like older men, detective?

330
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,700
'Cause your husband died in 1942.

331
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,000
Nice trick with the decoy.

332
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
Well, if I knew they'd
send a cop looks like you,

333
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,100
I wouldn't have bothered.

334
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,800
Gonna make this
hard on us, spencer?

335
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,300
Wouldn't dream of it.

336
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,900
You've been lucky a
long time, spencer.

337
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,465
18 years, not one arrest.

338
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,100
It's not luck that's
kept me out of trouble.

339
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,500
I'm out of the game.

340
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,600
Just like any working man.

341
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Fake social.

342
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,400
Half a dozen aliases.

343
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:38,800
Which name's real?

344
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,665
You gonna turn me in to the feds?

345
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,900
We're not interested
in your scams, spencer.

346
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:46,300
We're murder police.

347
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,800
You think I shot margot.

348
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,600
I've been in and out of that
hospital a thousand times.

349
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:56,200
If I wanted margot dead,
I could've done it easy.

350
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,100
Fbi's just a phone
call away, spencer.

351
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,800
They'd be real excited to meet you.

352
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,000
All right, wait.

353
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,400
After we took the
redhead in cherry hill,

354
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,900
I wanted out.

355
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,100
I was sick of the game.

356
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,200
But then we got to philly and...

357
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,900
it started again.

358
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,300
Got a dream.

359
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,900
Little white shack in jamaica.

360
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,300
Right on the beach.

361
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,000
It's not much,

362
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,600
but I'd kill or die
to have you there.

363
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,165
You're overselling.

364
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,800
Too specific in the beginning,

365
00:19:35,835 --> 00:19:36,965
too grand at the end.

366
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,400
You want to entice the girl.

367
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,400
What the hell are you looking at?

368
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,600
You know why you like her?

369
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,800
She looks like me.

370
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,300
Trailer park version, anyway.

371
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:50,465
I'm sick of this.

372
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,000
The same bit, the same girl,

373
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:53,400
the same crappy motel.

374
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,200
I'm tired.

375
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,500
You tired of this, too?

376
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,600
Margie, I know you're there!

377
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:03,765
Who is it, the cops?

378
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,600
Just get in the bathroom now.

379
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,800
open the damn door now!

380
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,065
Where is he?

381
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,165
It's been a while, lenny.

382
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,665
What brings you to the big city?

383
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,200
I know that little
turd's here somewhere.

384
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:20,100
Don't take another step.

385
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,265
You gonna do me like you did hank?

386
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,400
I didn't put that gun
in your brother's mouth.

387
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:25,700
Might as well have, margie.

388
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:26,865
It's "margot" now.

389
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,600
You took every penny hank had.

390
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,065
You took his pride.

391
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,750
He had fun while it lasted.

392
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:34,400
He was my baby brother, margie.

393
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:35,467
I told you

394
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:36,500
it's "margot. "

395
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,400
Now get the hell out of my room.

396
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,500
You made a mistake.

397
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,200
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

398
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,300
'Cause I sure as hell
am going to make you pay.

399
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,300
it was the first time I
saw what we did to people.

400
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,900
After their lives fell apart.

401
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,900
I got out after that.

402
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,200
I took my split from cherry hill,

403
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,200
went to florida the next day.

404
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,700
And margot?

405
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,100
Well, when I left,
she was running scared.

406
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,600
Was planning a quick exit.

407
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,300
Not quick enough.

408
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,200
You buyin' this line?

409
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,165
Story holds.

410
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Henry delpy out of blossburg, pa

411
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:31,017
reported a margie kentworth

412
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:32,800
taking everything he owned

413
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:34,065
back in the mid
- '70s.

414
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,000
Guy ended up eating his gun.

415
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,300
The brother lenny goes after her

416
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:39,800
thinking eye for an eye?

417
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
check him out.

418
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,500
Well, what about prince charming?

419
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,200
I'll cut him loose.

420
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,600
But put a plainclothes unit
on him, see what he does.

421
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,300
margie finally got
in over her head.

422
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,965
You mean, margot.

423
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,700
She could've called
herself the queen of sheba.

424
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:10,500
It wasn't going to
change who she was:

425
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,900
Trailer-park trash, like all of us.

426
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,965
Are you saying she came from here?

427
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Oh, yeah. Two rows
back, as a matter of fact.

428
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,700
Though, by the age
of ten, you could see,

429
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:19,800
she meant to get out.

430
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:20,917
Ambitious?

431
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:22,000
Motivated.

432
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,600
Mom beat the crap
out of her daily...

433
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,100
yeah, margie would watch
the old movies to escape.

434
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:27,900
What was the one?

435
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,100
Audrey hepburn and humphrey bogart.

436
00:22:30,135 --> 00:22:31,900
Uh.. sabrina, yeah.

437
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,400
Poor girl makes good.

438
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,465
Like margot.

439
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,200
Yeah, margie watched
it over and over.

440
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,200
Started believing she deserved
more than a welfare husband

441
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:41,600
or a canned chili dinner.

442
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:42,565
Sad story.

443
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,565
Oh, no. She got what she deserved.

444
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,800
Well, not the attitude I'd be going
for if I was trying to look innocent.

445
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,300
I
- I wasn't out to kill her.

446
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,300
I was going to turn
her in to the cops.

447
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:52,965
Uh-huh.

448
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,100
This old hick from the boonies
had a few tricks up his own sleeve.

449
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,300
Planted a bug in her room.

450
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,100
lenny...

451
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,500
you're a man after my own heart.

452
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
what's that?

453
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,000
You've never had pop rocks before?

454
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,265
Okay.

455
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,700
Pour some in your mouth.

456
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,300
funny, right?

457
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,800
Now drink some soda.

458
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,400
where'd you come from?

459
00:23:42,435 --> 00:23:43,400
Nowhere.

460
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Born on the run, lived
that way ever since.

461
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,200
15 states in 18 years.

462
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,800
How about you?

463
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,900
Five miles down the interstate.

464
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,700
Where I was born, raised...

465
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,500
probably where I'll die.

466
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,700
Sounds like paradise.

467
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,000
um... sorry.

468
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,800
Um, I'll just go.

469
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,400
Leave the towels.

470
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,965
No time to be doing the maid.

471
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,300
I mean, honestly, what's the angle?

472
00:24:34,335 --> 00:24:35,665
The angle, margot,

473
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,865
is none of your business.

474
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,600
Everything's my business right now.

475
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:39,465
We're in trouble.

476
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
And while you were
servicing the help,

477
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:43,600
I was working our exit strategy.

478
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,365
Life insurance?

479
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,900
Three million dollars' worth.

480
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,000
All I got to do is sign over
the beneficiary card to you.

481
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:51,900
I die.

482
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,500
We're rich.

483
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,400
You kind of really need
a body to make this work.

484
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
Insurance companies won't
take your word on it.

485
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,700
That maid of yours, kylie-

486
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,500
she really does a crap job.

487
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,500
No way.

488
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,100
She's off-limits.

489
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:10,165
She looks like me.

490
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,700
With a little
work, the right clothes,

491
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:13,165
we could pass as twins.

492
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,500
I've never asked you for anything,

493
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,900
not once, but I'm asking now.

494
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,000
We don't have the time.

495
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
And she already trusts you.

496
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,800
It's perfect.

497
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,865
I won't do it.

498
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,300
You don't have a choice.

499
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,550
Your other option is run,

500
00:25:30,585 --> 00:25:32,365
for the rest of your life.

501
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,950
Because lenny's just the first.

502
00:25:33,985 --> 00:25:35,500
There's more out there, guaranteed.

503
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,500
We reached the end
of the line, baby.

504
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,700
But with this,

505
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,300
not only do we disappear,

506
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,500
we do it rich.

507
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,900
Then you can buy any
kind of normal you want.

508
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,600
So by the time I got the
tape to anyone who'd listen,

509
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,265
margie and the kid had disappeared,

510
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,800
and I mean vanished off
the face of this earth.

511
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
So margot was going
to fake her own death

512
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:06,200
using the boyfriend's new girl?

513
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,100
Boyfriend?

514
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,000
Is that what you guys think?

515
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,800
Spencer wasn't margie's boyfriend.

516
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,300
He was her son.

517
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,365
But this is messed up.

518
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,100
Must've had the
kid when she was 14.

519
00:26:27,135 --> 00:26:28,800
Put him to work
before he could talk.

520
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,100
Conspiracy, fraud, murder.

521
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,400
Hallmarks of any
mother-son relationship.

522
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,600
Got it.

523
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,500
I found the insurance policy.

524
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,965
"Three million dollars,

525
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,300
taken out on margot mckinney.

526
00:26:40,335 --> 00:26:41,717
Payable to...

527
00:26:41,752 --> 00:26:43,065
linus larrabee. "

528
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,500
Expired three years ago.

529
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,465
Woman takes a bullet to the skull,

530
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,800
manages to hold on three years
after her insurance expires.

531
00:26:49,835 --> 00:26:51,465
What I call resolve.

532
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,565
Now, who's linus larrabee?

533
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,500
Figure spencer can shed some light.

534
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
'Cause he's been so
forthright up to now?

535
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,965
Doesn't matter.

536
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,665
Spencer ducked his
tail an hour ago.

537
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,600
Lost in a crowd of tourists
by independence park.

538
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:05,565
That slick son of a bitch.

539
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,800
On the other hand, we've
got a lead on kylie kramer,

540
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,200
the motel maid.

541
00:27:09,235 --> 00:27:09,965
Not dead?

542
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,065
Very much alive.

543
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,600
She's got a history, too.

544
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,250
Juvenile record.

545
00:27:14,285 --> 00:27:15,500
So it's sealed.

546
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,800
Not anymore.

547
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,600
Kylie's father went down

548
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:19,765
for rape when she was nine.

549
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,700
Put her in bad with
men from the start.

550
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,100
This girl's no joke.

551
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,000
Stalking charges, battery.

552
00:27:27,035 --> 00:27:27,800
Agg assault?

553
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,000
Knifed a guy who
was two-timing her.

554
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,600
Maybe kylie gets wind of
margot's plan to do her in...

555
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:35,300
does margot first.

556
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,400
Spencer was good. You know?

557
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,400
Better than them
other slugs out there.

558
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,500
Kind of guy you want
to hang on to, huh?

559
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,200
Believe me, girl, I
tried, with everything I got.

560
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,800
Mother issues, right?

561
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,200
Same story, different book.

562
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,000
If it's not a wife, it's a mom.

563
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,600
Margot was a bitch on wheels.

564
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,200
Bitch that deserved to die?

565
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,000
That's not me saying it.

566
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,900
I heard you were
handy with a blade,

567
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,800
push comes to shove.

568
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,900
Troubled youth is
what they call it.

569
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,300
But that's the past.

570
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,900
Like to believe you, kylie.

571
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:20,365
The only problem is

572
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,100
margot was looking to take
you out of the picture.

573
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,317
You still being here,

574
00:28:24,352 --> 00:28:25,500
and her being dead...

575
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,700
brings up questions.

576
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,500
Well, maybe I have some answers.

577
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,700
I told you, margot.
I don't want it.

578
00:28:35,735 --> 00:28:38,200
Of course you do. It's godiva.

579
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,600
It's got sauce inside.

580
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:45,365
Not sauce, cherry cordial.

581
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,500
It's not a thousand-dollar napkin.

582
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:48,765
Margot, she's an adult.

583
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,900
Well, all evidence to the contrary.

584
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,300
Now, let's see if we've
made any improvement.

585
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
What the hell is this?

586
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,000
I think you look great.

587
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,900
I look like you.

588
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,900
But that's what spencer likes, dear.

589
00:29:07,935 --> 00:29:10,100
No. I liked her the way she was.

590
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,665
Oh, don't frown, kylie.

591
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,500
Show off those pearly
whites we fixed for you.

592
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,600
The bill's paid.

593
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,065
By whom?

594
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,365
A red-headed woman.

595
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
She left this, said
it belongs to him.

596
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,500
How'd she find us?

597
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,465
We've got to complete this tonight.

598
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,900
We can'T. We don't
got a choice, spencer.

599
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,000
Complete what?

600
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,900
should've seen the
looks on their faces.

601
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,400
Like they just got
goosed or something.

602
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,400
What happened after that?

603
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,700
I go to spencer's room
that night and he is gone.

604
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:49,900
I mean, not a trace.

605
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:50,900
Margot, too...

606
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,700
along with my last
chance at something real.

607
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,100
Take it from me, girl...

608
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,000
you dodged a bullet.

609
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,000
rush.

610
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,000
Your boss made a mistake.

611
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,980
Should've put you on my tail.

612
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,750
Where are you, spencer?

613
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,270
Haven't guessed my real name yet?

614
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,120
I'm not playing games.

615
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,320
Go to the beginning,

616
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:14,870
figure it out.

617
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,020
When you do, I'll be waiting.

618
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,380
You lied to us, melissa.

619
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,550
You weren't over
spencer, far from it.

620
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,000
You were following him.

621
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,970
Looking to settle the score.

622
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,050
That's not true.

623
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,340
A witness places you at
a philadelphia hair salon

624
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,910
with margot same day
she took a bullet.

625
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,410
Got a registered
nine-millimeter beretta,

626
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,500
belongs to your husband.

627
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,170
They took from you, melissa.

628
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,650
Played you like a cheap piano.

629
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,680
He nearly destroyed my marriage.

630
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,220
I don't doubt it.

631
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,500
Trying to explain
away all that cash.

632
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,980
It wasn't the money.

633
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,500
It was the humiliation.

634
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,180
They were laughing at me.

635
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,260
You couldn't let that stand.

636
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,780
I tracked him down.

637
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,970
Took weeks.

638
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,350
Calling every damn country club

639
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,230
in new jersey, new
york, pennsylvania.

640
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,210
And that's when you
decided to kill them.

641
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,820
I watched them at the motel.

642
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,570
Waited for dark.

643
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,340
For my moment...

644
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,170
I saw a woman going
into spencer's room.

645
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,230
At first, I thought it was margot,

646
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,490
but it wasn'T.

647
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,130
oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god.

648
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,750
I don't know what the hell
happened and I don't want to know.

649
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,600
I left.

650
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,650
Tried to forget I was ever there.

651
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,480
So kylie and spencer
double-crossed margot.

652
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,380
They fake her
murder, make it look real.

653
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,690
Why?

654
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:37,080
They needed her to sign the
beficiary card on the insurance.

655
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:43,870
That means margot the master
grifter got beat at her own game.

656
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,930
I did what you said.

657
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,600
I went to the beginning.

658
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,030
Blossburg.

659
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,920
Not much consensus on margot,

660
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:16,270
except everyone remembers
she loved those old movies...

661
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,460
especially sabrina.

662
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,220
Yeah, must have seen
it a thousand times.

663
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,820
It's a good one.

664
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,740
What was humphrey
bogart's name in it again?

665
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,010
Uh...

666
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,180
linus...

667
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,920
larrabee.

668
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,630
linus larrabee.

669
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,960
The same name's on
the hotel registry.

670
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,590
Also, the beneficiary on
margot's insurance policy.

671
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,460
Your birth name, right?

672
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,320
Yeah, margot thought
it sounded fancy.

673
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,740
It didn't do me any
favors on the playground.

674
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,930
I know what it's like.

675
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,370
Having a difficult mother.

676
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,030
Took you out on the road early, huh?

677
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,360
Put me to work at six.

678
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,660
Well, that kind of life,

679
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,610
anyone could understand your anger.

680
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,970
Playing the sympathy card.

681
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,250
Is that your game, lilly?

682
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,520
You wanted me to find you here.

683
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,430
Why?

684
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,790
I'd never hurt margot.

685
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,100
I took care of her all those years.

686
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,800
Because she was your mother.

687
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,590
She was the only one who knew me.

688
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,280
No one will ever love
me the way she did.

689
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,250
Then why'd you kill her?

690
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,430
You're a con man.

691
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,480
Probably lie with your last breath.

692
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,240
But I need you to be honest.

693
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,910
Not for me.

694
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,390
For margot.

695
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,930
For your mother.

696
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,170
I just wanted to be normal.

697
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,830
Stand up, baby. You're going
to get blood everywhere.

698
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,960
Come on. Move.

699
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,360
got to go now, baby.

700
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,390
Everything's going to be okay.

701
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,420
I'll make sure of it.

702
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,640
You have to sign the
beneficiary card over to me.

703
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,560
You earned it tonight, kid.

704
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,760
Guess I did.

705
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,120
We'll dump the body,

706
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,750
get rid of the car.

707
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,880
I got the bus tickets, too.

708
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,350
Blanks?

709
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,000
I didn't think you had it in you.

710
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,650
Honestly, I didn't
see it coming at all.

711
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,010
Work of art, darling.

712
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,200
And who knew you had a brain?

713
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,800
Spencer, do it already.

714
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,070
Put the gunwn, dolinus.

715
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,460
She's not worth it.

716
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,520
Shut up, margot.

717
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,080
I did it all for you
because I love you.

718
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,240
You're the only one who matters.

719
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,240
Don't listen to her, spencer.

720
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,330
The day you were born,

721
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,140
I swore you'd have a better life.

722
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,200
You're my only
reason to live, linus.

723
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,290
You're my son.

724
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,050
I can'T.

725
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,410
And I'm your mother.

726
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,640
You're a monster.

727
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,240
mama?

728
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,690
Mama?

729
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,930
Say something.

730
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,210
Please.

731
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,870
I'm sorry, mama.

732
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,440
I'm so sorry.

733
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,950
I wanted so bad to
have my own life,

734
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,450
to be free of her.

735
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,840
Now after all these years,

736
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,050
you are.

737
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:10,040
And I'm so...

738
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,930
lost without her.

739
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,600
It was his idea...

740
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,410
the whole thing.

741
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,310
Take her down and get the money.

742
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,630
But I never had a chance
with that woman in his life.

743
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,560
He was what she made him.

744
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
She was his mother.

745
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,330
We were supposed to be free after.

746
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,930
but spencer just sat
there, staring at her.

747
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:51,160
So you did everything.

748
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:51,980
Cleaned the room,

749
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,790
dumped the body, the car.

750
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,890
All he had to do
was come and get me.

751
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,930
He never showed.

752
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,290
Three days I waited...

753
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,450
and then I heard the
news on the radio.

754
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,270
That bitch was still alive.

755
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,080
I've been waiting.

756
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,980
Where were you?

757
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,190
Spencer.

758
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:49,160
It's time to go before
somebody sees us here.

759
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,590
I did this for you, you know?

760
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,130
For our dreams.

761
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,270
Remember?

762
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,120
We're free now.

763
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:05,190
We can go anywhere we want.

764
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,090
Please don't make me go alone.

765
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,200
I can't leave her.

766
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,140
She's my mother.
