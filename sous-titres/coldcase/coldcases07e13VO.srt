00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:02,817
................

2
00:00:04,818 --> 00:00:06,218
........

3
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:07,819
Lines got to be strong, you see ?

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,620
No time to think.

5
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:11,221
Just let it happen.

6
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:14,186
Paint's like your blood,

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,654
Telling the whole world you've been up here.

8
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:22,728
You all right, little man ?

9
00:00:24,363 --> 00:00:25,397
Leon !

10
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:27,466
Come on, man.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,234
I can't move, carlos.

12
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:30,735
Just got to stop looking down.

13
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:34,038
Look up. Look, you can do it.

14
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:35,940
Come on. I got you.

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,276
There you go.

16
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:41,646
When it's darkest, men see stars.

17
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:43,982
When it's darkest, men see stars.

18
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:45,584
Ain't no stars, Leon.

19
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:47,986
Not in my universe anyway.

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,121
No stars ?

21
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:50,255
What do you mean ?

22
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:51,857
Ma kicked me out.

23
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:53,658
I tell you that ?

24
00:00:53,693 --> 00:00:56,094
Like I don't even exist.

25
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,436
<i>"You dropped a bomb on me"
by The Gap Band.</i>

26
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,738
Ain't nobody bombing like Blaze.

27
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:09,908
Take a picture.

28
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:22,320
By the time I'm done,

29
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:24,890
The whole city's gonna know
my name.

30
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:10,068
What, are you taking a trip ?

31
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,805
No. A friend bought a condo
in Boca.

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,740
Thinking of investing myself.

33
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:17,576
Oh. Looks quiet.

34
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,878
It's probably a good place to write.

35
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:21,413
What's that supposed to mean ?

36
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:25,183
Didn't Hemingway live in Florida ?

37
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:28,887
I need to talk to someone
about my son's murder.

38
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:30,956
Well, I'm detective lilly rush.

39
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,524
My partner, scotty valens.

40
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:34,159
What was your son's name ?

41
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:35,794
Carlos Espinosa.

42
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:38,129
Killed October 11, 1982.

43
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,531
Someone sprayed paint
In his mouth

44
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:42,501
till he suffocated.

45
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:45,403
I put his things in storage.

46
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:49,374
Last week, motel where
I work in cut my hours.

47
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:51,843
Can't afford the storage anymore ?

48
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,181
Like most, can't afford
much of anything.

49
00:02:57,717 --> 00:03:01,419
When I was cleaning it out,
I found this in his backpack.

50
00:03:04,624 --> 00:03:06,124
Yeah, seen these back in narc.

51
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:07,926
It's a graffiti writer's black book.

52
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,961
It's why I needed to talk to you.

53
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:14,332
I told the police back then my
son was nothing but a huffer.

54
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:15,834
He was sniffing paint?

55
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:18,603
Well, I'd catch him huddled up
with a paper bag and paint cans,

56
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:20,272
stealing money out of my purse...

57
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:21,740
He never talked about graffiti ?

58
00:03:21,774 --> 00:03:23,241
We hardly saw each other.

59
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:25,110
I had to work three jobs

60
00:03:25,144 --> 00:03:26,778
just to keep a roof over our heads.

61
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:27,979
You thought he was an addict.

62
00:03:28,014 --> 00:03:30,415
So I kicked him out.

63
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:32,085
But he was an artist...

64
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:33,886
wasn't he ?

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,454
You ever see Carlos
after he left the house ?

66
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,125
He'd sneak in after I left for work,
raid the fridge.

67
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,861
Left his backpack once.

68
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:45,630
Next day, they told me he was dead.

69
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:48,166
Look at this one.

70
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,002
It was October 11, 1982.

71
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:53,071
That's the day carlos died, right?

72
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:55,607
T-u-r ?

73
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:57,809
It looks like part of a bigger piece,

74
00:03:57,843 --> 00:04:00,211
but there's no other pictures.

75
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:01,713
You know where this photo
was taken ?

76
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:02,881
I wish.

77
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:04,349
Like to see it myself.

78
00:04:04,383 --> 00:04:06,350
You know who Carlos
was hanging out with ?

79
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:08,019
Other taggers, friends ?

80
00:04:08,054 --> 00:04:10,488
No idea.

81
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:14,025
Mistake I made,
kicking him out of the house.

82
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,527
Lil.

83
00:04:18,698 --> 00:04:20,198
Something here.

84
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:22,801
Carlos bombed over someone else's work.

85
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:25,503
"nrke."

86
00:04:25,838 --> 00:04:27,405
Anarchy ?

87
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:30,408
Some kind of insult ?

88
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:32,344
That's a declaration of war.

89
00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:34,312
Hard-core punks in that world ?

90
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:36,715
No way they're letting him get away with it.

91
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:39,217
Well, maybe nrke got even,

92
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,519
Dropped a bomb on Carlos.

93
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:51,926
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

94
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:14,092
Bombers

95
00:05:19,993 --> 00:05:21,727
Carlos Espinosa.

96
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:23,162
16 years old.

97
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:24,396
Body was found in an alley

98
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:27,900
in kensington on October 11, 1982.

99
00:05:27,934 --> 00:05:30,069
Autopsy report indicates a skull fracture.

100
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:31,337
M.E. found chips of paint

101
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:33,472
in the gash on Carlos's head.

102
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,674
Cause of death was asphyxiation.

103
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,209
Someone bashed his head against the wall

104
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:39,645
before that paint was
forced down his throat.

105
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,780
Assigned figured another
huffer jumped Carlos,

106
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:44,115
used his own can of paint
against him.

107
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,685
Murder weapon found under
some debris... couldn't lift a print.

108
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,022
Well, see if you can trace the can,
locate the retailer.

109
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:52,658
Victim had three healed broken ribs

110
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:54,093
at the time of his death.

111
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:55,527
Well, mom kicked him out,

112
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:57,129
and Carlos was living on the streets.

113
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:59,665
Lot of ways for a kid
to get hurt out there.

114
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,533
Any idea where he racked his supplies ?

115
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:04,003
Well, mom said she found
receipts in his jean pockets--

116
00:06:04,037 --> 00:06:05,871
Uh, small stuff like gum.

117
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:07,239
That's an old trick.

118
00:06:07,274 --> 00:06:09,074
Pay for something cheap,
so no one's suspicious,

119
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:10,209
then shoplift the paint.

120
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:12,578
Well, the receipts were from a...

121
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:14,346
Harold's hardware.

122
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:17,916
I'll show them a photo,
see if maybe someone remembers Carlos.

123
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:20,219
Had a steady hand. Clean lines.

124
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:21,720
Looked into nrke.

125
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:23,155
The crew was notorious

126
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:25,090
in the '80s for violent street justice.

127
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,859
So, Carlos was killed in their hood ?

128
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:28,627
Yeah, two blocks from their clubhouse.

129
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:29,962
Well, we're going to need names.

130
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:32,931
I'm meeting with the head of the
graffiti removal commission,

131
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:34,366
Uh, Don Bardwill.

132
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:36,068
Been on the scene three decades.

133
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:39,838
Says he knew nrke up close and personal.

134
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:44,410
Curtis, hey.

135
00:06:45,544 --> 00:06:46,612
Uh, I was wondering...

136
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:47,846
Yeah ?

137
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:50,849
How you and your ex
agreed on custody.

138
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:52,918
That's what you were wondering ?

139
00:06:53,452 --> 00:06:55,253
Well, I wouldn't say that me

140
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:56,422
and the soul crusher agreed on anything.

141
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:58,757
So, you petitioned for visitation ?

142
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:01,260
Wait. What's going on, Kat ?

143
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:03,629
Jarrod sent me a letter.

144
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:06,064
He got married, moved back to Philly.

145
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:07,032
He wants veronica

146
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,401
to stay with him two weekends
a month.

147
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:11,236
What are my options ?

148
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,271
Well, you could play hardball,

149
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:14,139
force him to file a custody complaint.

150
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:15,541
Would veronica have to testify ?

151
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:17,443
Strong possibility.

152
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:19,277
What else ?

153
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:20,512
I don't know. Sit down with the guy.

154
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:22,014
There's probably a way to work it out.

155
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:24,016
How do you work it out with an ex-banger

156
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,184
who wants custody of your kid ?

157
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:26,652
I could come.

158
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:28,554
Uh, not as a lawyer.

159
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:30,189
You know, just as your boyfriend.

160
00:07:30,223 --> 00:07:31,657
Yeah, okay.

161
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:33,425
Yeah. But...

162
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:36,762
Never said you were my boyfriend.

163
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:40,766
I'll see you...

164
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,834
later.

165
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:43,202
Lil.

166
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:44,837
Oh, hey, lover boy.

167
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:46,305
We need to talk.

168
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,474
- So talk.
- In private.

169
00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:50,943
Got something to show you.

170
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:52,811
So...

171
00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:55,214
Uh... Here, give me a hand, will you ?

172
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:57,250
We're looking for a, um...

173
00:07:57,784 --> 00:08:00,919
Private criminal complaint.

174
00:08:00,954 --> 00:08:03,321
Filed by moe kitchener.

175
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:04,089
That's it.

176
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:07,059
Against one Lillian Rush.

177
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:08,860
Let's see.

178
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:10,562
You put a boot on his car.

179
00:08:10,597 --> 00:08:12,297
Harassed his loan officer.

180
00:08:12,332 --> 00:08:14,366
Gave him a night in the
drunk tank with... Tico ?

181
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:15,735
Yeah.

182
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:16,736
He forget anything ?

183
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,370
It's not the first
complaint he's ever filed.

184
00:08:18,405 --> 00:08:21,074
Yeah, but this one's from the
DA's office,

185
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:22,175
Lil, not IAB.

186
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,376
These guys can prosecute you for a crime.

187
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:26,779
Thanks. Got it.

188
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:30,917
I don't know what's going
on with you, but...

189
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:32,851
This could cost you your career.

190
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,587
You done talking yet ?

191
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:37,790
Hey, you're on your own.

192
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:40,259
Always have been.

193
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:45,330
Called me the graffiti
gestapo back in the day.

194
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:46,498
Colorful name.

195
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,400
Cruised around in my mercury monarch

196
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:51,036
with a gallon of paint, removers.

197
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,473
People say these kids
are vandals, crooks.

198
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:56,041
Wonder why.

199
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:57,478
Just neglected kids

200
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,279
trying to show the world
they exist.

201
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:01,413
Painting murals gives them an outlet.

202
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:03,148
Beautifies the city in the process.

203
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:04,783
Yeah, you got that list we asked for ?

204
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:06,218
Nrke, right ?

205
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:07,686
It's here somewhere.

206
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,958
Turbo 102.

207
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:15,694
- This look like the same tag ?
- Judging by the way

208
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:17,696
The T's slanted,
I'd say it's him all right.

209
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,665
- Who is he ?
- Good question.

210
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:21,633
Guy's been bombing the city
almost three decades.

211
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:22,835
Are you saying he

212
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:24,002
still hits places today ?

213
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:26,772
Most bombers leave churches
and cemeteries alone.

214
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:29,741
Turbo's got no respect
for anything or anyone.

215
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:31,877
Do you know
where this photo was taken ?

216
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:35,080
Too small to make out any landmarks.

217
00:09:35,114 --> 00:09:36,181
Where'd you get it ?

218
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:38,851
Kid we're looking into, Carlos Espinosa.

219
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:40,285
This was his black book.

220
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,753
Went by Blaze.

221
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:43,622
Oh, I know that tag.

222
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:45,557
You didn't mention Blaze

223
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:46,859
on the phone.

224
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:48,861
Is that why you asked about NRKE ?

225
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:50,562
Why, is there a connect ?

226
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:53,665
Blaze was new on the scene.

227
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,269
Nrke taught him a serious lesson.

228
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:07,914
<i>"We want the airwaves"
by The Ramones.</i>

229
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:11,283
What the hell you doing, hermano ?

230
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:14,920
Just trying to get my name
on the map.

231
00:10:14,954 --> 00:10:16,989
You got to dis to get noticed.

232
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:20,192
Nobody bombs here without going through me.

233
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:22,295
This is nrke's wall.

234
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:24,596
Fool, I am nrke.

235
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:27,232
This is pretty.

236
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:29,301
It's better than what was up there. Yeah.

237
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:30,869
Who is this kid ?

238
00:10:31,603 --> 00:10:33,305
You think you got style ?

239
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,341
This is my block. I'm the king.

240
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,409
You'd better get somebody
else to do your writing, man.

241
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:40,280
You're cocky for somebody who's
about to get his ass beat.

242
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:52,691
Turn him over.

243
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:57,763
I catch you capping my spot again,

244
00:10:57,797 --> 00:10:59,665
I'm gonna feed you this can.

245
00:11:04,304 --> 00:11:06,171
Hey, get out of here, narc,
or you're next.

246
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:15,080
It's what happens when you leave
a bunch of kids on their own.

247
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:16,515
You call the cops ?

248
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,450
Drove straight to a pay phone.

249
00:11:18,484 --> 00:11:20,586
By the time they got
there everyone was gone--

250
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,020
Including blaze.

251
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:24,022
Explains the broken ribs.

252
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:25,624
What about the thug ?

253
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:28,661
Head of nrke ?
Called himself tut.

254
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:31,697
One thing I know :

255
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:34,866
Nobody disrespected the king.

256
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,755
Philly's finest looking for
a new paint job ?

257
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,625
Shop's a step up from tagging with nrke.

258
00:12:01,228 --> 00:12:02,962
Nrke.

259
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:04,664
Haven't heard that name in a while.

260
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:05,931
Understand you were the king.

261
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:07,366
Took it pretty serious.

262
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:08,801
Thought I was bombing the system,

263
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:10,269
leaving my mark.

264
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:13,306
Just a bunch of hoodlums
running on the streets.

265
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,875
Investigating the murder
of Carlos Espinosa.

266
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:19,111
Went by the tag of blaze back in '82.

267
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:22,915
Not a bad throw up.
Probably would've messed him up

268
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:24,651
Real good if I would've caught him.

269
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,219
Got a witness says you
were doing exactly that.

270
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:28,921
"Gonna feed you this can."

271
00:12:28,955 --> 00:12:30,556
Sound familiar ?

272
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,491
Look, uh, back in the day,

273
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:35,594
thought the only thing you had
in this world was your name,

274
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,962
Your reputation.

275
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:38,431
Well, toy like Carlos disses you,

276
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:40,533
you gotta show him you mean
business, right ?

277
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:43,068
But the boy came around a few weeks later,

278
00:12:43,102 --> 00:12:44,403
tail between his legs,

279
00:12:44,437 --> 00:12:47,907
and the king granted him a pardon.

280
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:50,743
Believe this ?

281
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:53,079
Fool's stupider than I thought.

282
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:55,715
- I want to go.
- Come on, Leon.

283
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:58,983
- You got my back, right ?
- Yeah man.

284
00:12:59,217 --> 00:13:02,819
<i>"Let it whip" by Dazz Band.</i>

285
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:05,758
Bring us a punching bag, hombre ?

286
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:07,693
It's cool, Leon. I got this.

287
00:13:09,196 --> 00:13:10,531
Drank too much,

288
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:13,032
disrespected you
and your whole crew.

289
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:17,436
Hell, everybody knows the
king's tearing it up all over.

290
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:21,273
I got a peace offering.

291
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:30,249
Next time, bring better beer.

292
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:34,387
Come here.

293
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:37,390
I saw your tag up on the
Alleghany Water tower.

294
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:39,392
Going higher next time.

295
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:41,360
You got a lot of sack, climbing up there.

296
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:44,263
Fall off a roof, go to heaven.

297
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:46,232
Highest spot of all.

298
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:50,002
Say, man, toy like you needs a crew.

299
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:51,336
A place to crash.

300
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:53,205
Throw slo-mo here some scraps.

301
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,207
You all planning any pieces ?
Burners ?

302
00:13:55,242 --> 00:13:56,909
Come on, man, this is nrke.

303
00:13:57,243 --> 00:13:58,844
All-out destruction, man.

304
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,414
You know what I'm saying ?

305
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:02,882
You want pretty pieces,

306
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,918
you going to yourself a
graffiti coloring book.

307
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:07,853
All right.

308
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:10,990
- Let me think about it.
- What's there to think about ?

309
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:14,193
Nrke reigns supreme,
nobody comes close.

310
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:15,795
Can we go now ?

311
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:18,197
Yeah, man. Just-just give me a minute.

312
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:25,838
Be careful, man.

313
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:27,640
That chick's dangerous.

314
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:34,113
Hey. I'm Carlos.

315
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:39,218
Not anymore.

316
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,356
Now...

317
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,593
...You're mine.

318
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:50,028
"Talon" ?

319
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:58,804
Thought he was gonna join the crew,
make me look good.

320
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:02,007
- And he turned you down ?
- Can you believe it ?

321
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:04,544
Thought I was giving him
the keys to the castle.

322
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:06,811
Now, who was the kid with Carlos ?

323
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:10,216
- Never knew his name.
- What about the girl ?

324
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,151
Uh... Gina something.

325
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:14,487
Always writing with that nasty orange.

326
00:15:14,521 --> 00:15:15,688
She part of your crew ?

327
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:16,922
She wanted to be.

328
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,391
Told her she had a sloppy
hand with no style.

329
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:22,127
You know how she got her tag, Talon ?

330
00:15:22,762 --> 00:15:25,164
Heard she clawed out
some guy's eyes.

331
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:27,800
Tried to warn Carlos,
but once she got it in you,

332
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:30,002
she ain't never letting go.

333
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,408
Yeah ?

334
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,878
Carlos's last piece.

335
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,493
ID put it under a complex magnifier.

336
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:43,537
Get anything ?

337
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:45,472
The wall has oval-shaped bricks.

338
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:48,554
There's one place in town
with those bricks : the sewer system.

339
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:50,742
Tagger's mo is to get his name up
where everyone can see it.

340
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:52,917
Why go underground ?

341
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,452
The last piece he ever drew.

342
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,162
Chance it could shed some light.

343
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,739
Lot of sewers, boss.

344
00:15:57,864 --> 00:15:59,474
Distribute a flyer with Carlos's photo

345
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,386
and a polaroid of his last piece.

346
00:16:01,511 --> 00:16:03,628
Pwd workers, homeless shelters.

347
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,829
Maybe we get lucky.

348
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:07,182
I tracked down the owner
of harold's.

349
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:09,859
Said Carlos was seeing
one of his employees.

350
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,493
Gina Lopresi.

351
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:14,587
Yeah, fired her once he realized
she was stealing all the spray paint.

352
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:16,140
You show her photo to "king tut" ?

353
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:18,884
Id'd her as Talon.
Will's tracking her down now.

354
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:19,936
Talon, huh ?

355
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,856
Well, it's time we stick
our claws in her.

356
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:32,134
So, you, um...

357
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,543
moved from Detroit ?

358
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:36,885
Last month.
Yeah, finally got settled.

359
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:38,013
Unpacked the last box.

360
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,564
And got the girls enrolled in school.

361
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,540
I have two daughters,
Connie and Cassie.

362
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,452
We got a place with a bedroom
for Veronica, too.

363
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:45,185
Painted it her favorite

364
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,021
Color. Purple.

365
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:47,422
Lavender, baby.

366
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:48,923
Right, lavender.

367
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,046
'Cause apparently there's a difference.

368
00:16:55,953 --> 00:16:56,865
Sorry.

369
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,657
I gotta go.

370
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,837
- Dame.
- Ah, gracias.

371
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,743
Your mother, she gets
more beautiful every day.

372
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:20,254
He does that to get out
of doing the dishes.

373
00:17:20,946 --> 00:17:23,185
Think I don't know
your tricks, viejo ?

374
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:28,787
How's your knee, ma ?

375
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:31,590
Doctor said it's fine.

376
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:36,104
So, you going to grace us
with your presence on Sunday ?

377
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:38,197
I'm making arroz con gandules.

378
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:41,498
Hey. Pierson.

379
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,212
<i>Got another purse snatching
outside the dayley's market.</i>

380
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:46,838
<i>Same MO. Older hispanic lady.</i>

381
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,740
<i>Taking her statement now.</i>

382
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:51,977
Uh... Hold her till I get there.

383
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:52,978
<i>Got it.</i>

384
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:57,200
I'm sorry, ma, I gotta...

385
00:17:57,489 --> 00:17:59,118
take this. It's work.

386
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,254
It's always work with you, Scotty.

387
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,176
When you gonna slow down ?

388
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:06,359
Sunday.

389
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:08,093
Arroz con gandules.

390
00:18:16,968 --> 00:18:18,263
Gina Lopresi ?

391
00:18:19,785 --> 00:18:21,473
Sorry, we're closed.

392
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:22,474
Philly P.D.

393
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:26,349
What can I do for you ?

394
00:18:28,088 --> 00:18:30,558
Nice stuff for a girl from the streets.

395
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,285
Graffiti vandal turned boutique owner.

396
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:35,367
Graffiti taught me skills.

397
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:39,200
How to market my name,
resilience, respect.

398
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:40,793
What's this about ?

399
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:42,320
Know where this was taken ?

400
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:46,666
Never seen it before.

401
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:48,777
Ever go to the sewer to tag ?

402
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:50,194
Why would I do that ?

403
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,739
To hang with your boyfriend,
Carlos Espinosa.

404
00:18:54,643 --> 00:18:56,151
Carlos wasn't my boyfriend.

405
00:18:56,576 --> 00:18:57,923
You stealing all that paint

406
00:18:58,048 --> 00:19:00,179
from Harold's hardware
just for yourself ?

407
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,591
I did a lot of crazy things
when I was a teenager.

408
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:05,784
Racking paint for a boy I liked
was just one of 'em.

409
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:07,462
Crazy is a good way to put it.

410
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,148
Arrested three times for vandalism.
One for agg. assault.

411
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,790
The assault was self-defense.

412
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,225
Not the way the judge saw it.

413
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,260
My stepfather used to beat me.

414
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:17,129
One day he got the idea
to toss me out

415
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:18,540
a third-floor window.

416
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:20,732
Clawed his eyes out to stop him.

417
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:25,113
Fluorescent orange is still
your signature color.

418
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:27,194
I like orange.

419
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:28,908
Is that a crime ?

420
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:30,052
No.

421
00:19:30,828 --> 00:19:32,294
But this is...

422
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:38,369
Heard he was killed.

423
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,521
I didn't know it was like this.

424
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,125
Carlos thought no one could touch him.

425
00:19:47,527 --> 00:19:48,793
He was wrong.

426
00:19:49,912 --> 00:19:51,429
Come here, I want to show something.

427
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:56,925
Blaze and Talon.

428
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,694
It looks alive.

429
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,708
I've never seen anything like it.

430
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:04,877
Your name should be up high.

431
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:10,702
I see you.

432
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,051
Yeah, who told you to look ?

433
00:20:13,632 --> 00:20:16,204
Why don't you just write your
last name up there, too, Leon ?

434
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,299
Use the name I gave you.

435
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:19,424
Turbo.

436
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:21,660
The fastest tagger in town.

437
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:26,261
<i>"Rapture" by Blondie.</i>

438
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,301
So, what's with you and speed bump ?

439
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,403
Don't say things like that, all right ?

440
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,605
He might start believing it.

441
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,816
Sorry.

442
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:38,586
He's got a raw deal, that's all.

443
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:41,690
Pretty decent of you,
letting him tag along.

444
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:44,459
Everybody needs someone, right ?

445
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,660
Get down ! Get down !

446
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:47,494
- What's wrong ?
- Got some cop after me.

447
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,997
He always knows where I'm at.
I don't know how.

448
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,902
He chased me down an
alley with a flashlight,

449
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:56,217
said he was gonna bash my head in.

450
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:57,972
- What for ?
- I don't know. Guy's obsessed.

451
00:20:58,097 --> 00:20:59,932
He's always buffing out my tags.

452
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:02,434
I catch you, you're dead, Blaze !

453
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,169
That-that's him ! Run !

454
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,812
Carlos was different.

455
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,722
Always taking care of other people.

456
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:16,064
This the guy who was chasing Carlos ?

457
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:18,443
Could be.

458
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,686
Carlos's friend, Leon...

459
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:22,597
You're saying he was Turbo ?

460
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:24,451
That's what Carlos called him.

461
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:27,159
Said he found him in an alley,
eating out of the trash.

462
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,703
Where can we find him ?

463
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:30,997
Six feet under. He fell off a roof

464
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:32,831
a week before Carlos died.

465
00:21:36,518 --> 00:21:37,518
Thank you.

466
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:40,544
We'll be in touch.

467
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:44,124
So, if Turbo's dead,

468
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:46,879
Who's using the tag Turbo 102 ?

469
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:50,015
I bet Don Bardwill knows.

470
00:21:57,356 --> 00:21:58,356
Hi.

471
00:21:58,391 --> 00:21:59,858
Detective valens.

472
00:22:00,592 --> 00:22:02,594
Thanks for waiting, belen.

473
00:22:03,028 --> 00:22:05,797
Your case is similar to
another case I'm working.

474
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:07,399
Yeah, I already told

475
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:08,800
That other young man everything.

476
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:11,103
Sorry to put you through this again.

477
00:22:11,137 --> 00:22:13,872
Can you tell me what happened,
por favor ?

478
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:17,376
Hoodlum came out of nowhere,
pushed me down.

479
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,745
Ran off with my pocketbook.

480
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:21,713
You get hurt ?

481
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:24,182
Scratched my knee.

482
00:22:24,617 --> 00:22:26,218
I'm fine.

483
00:22:26,252 --> 00:22:27,786
Did you get a look at the guy ?

484
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,555
My eyes aren't so good anymore.

485
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:33,525
What was he, white,
black, latino ?

486
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:36,828
All my groceries are in the trunk.

487
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:39,630
My ice cream's melting.

488
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:42,034
Help me get this guy
off the street.

489
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:43,869
Stop him from doing this again.

490
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:45,003
I have to go.

491
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:46,508
Belen...

492
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:50,109
there are other women
he's done this to.

493
00:22:50,143 --> 00:22:52,311
Women like you.

494
00:22:54,147 --> 00:22:56,448
You've spoken to them ?

495
00:22:57,482 --> 00:22:58,483
I...

496
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:04,423
I know...

497
00:23:04,757 --> 00:23:06,992
What he did to you.

498
00:23:16,535 --> 00:23:19,604
I wasn't strong enough to stop him.

499
00:23:25,177 --> 00:23:26,478
I tried to scream,

500
00:23:26,512 --> 00:23:30,649
But he put his hand over my mouth.

501
00:23:32,485 --> 00:23:34,953
He... put his hand
over your mouth ?

502
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:41,393
My husband is the only
man I've ever been with.

503
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:49,101
He told me to stop looking at him.

504
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:53,171
That was the only thing he said to me.

505
00:24:13,157 --> 00:24:14,659
You... you saw him ?

506
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:17,596
Oh, yes.

507
00:24:24,937 --> 00:24:26,905
Things we gotta do...

508
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,341
Get a nurse to see you...

509
00:24:30,476 --> 00:24:32,077
I don't know, no.

510
00:24:32,111 --> 00:24:34,546
Look, anyone that cares for you...

511
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,148
They're gonna understand...

512
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:38,984
It wasn't your fault.

513
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:41,053
I shouldn't have been there.

514
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:42,988
It wasn't your fault.

515
00:24:43,522 --> 00:24:46,224
You hear me, Belen ?

516
00:24:52,831 --> 00:24:54,633
I have to go.

517
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:59,804
My ice cream's melting.

518
00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:15,605
"Graffiti gestapo."

519
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,240
You get that nickname

520
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:19,875
For getting physical
with bombers like Carlos ?

521
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,743
'Course not.

522
00:25:20,778 --> 00:25:24,313
I was trying to clean up the streets,
not take on gangs.

523
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:25,881
Clean up the streets.

524
00:25:26,116 --> 00:25:28,083
That include chasing kids
with your flashlight ?

525
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:29,318
Threatening to beat them ?

526
00:25:29,352 --> 00:25:31,086
Might have tried to scare some punks.

527
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:32,188
You ask me,

528
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:33,923
degenerates had it coming.

529
00:25:33,957 --> 00:25:35,958
Someone's got to step up

530
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,860
and do something about it.
Right ?

531
00:25:37,895 --> 00:25:39,962
I was taking back our city.

532
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:43,232
What, by stalking Carlos ?
Hunting him down ?

533
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:45,334
Hey now,
I never stalked anyone.

534
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:47,770
So how'd you always know
where he was at ?

535
00:25:48,705 --> 00:25:51,507
I got calls when kids were bombing.

536
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:53,209
Told me where to go.

537
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,710
Always the same voice.

538
00:25:54,744 --> 00:25:57,546
You saying someone
was ratting out bombers ?

539
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,416
Don't know who it was.
Didn't care.

540
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:02,451
Made my job easier.

541
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:05,087
What about Leon ?
Chasing these kids around town.

542
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:06,755
You finally catch one ?

543
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:08,223
Don't know any Leon.

544
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:10,026
Oh, Carlos's little friend.

545
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,095
Took a nosedive 13 stories off a roof

546
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:14,296
a week before Carlos was murdered.

547
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,799
Sorry to hear that, but like I said,

548
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:19,001
don't know anyone named Leon.

549
00:26:19,335 --> 00:26:21,570
Want to tell me why your name's
on his accident report, then ?

550
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:24,540
Says here that you were
a witness to his death.

551
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:26,509
The date's October 2.

552
00:26:26,643 --> 00:26:28,711
Ten-two.

553
00:26:28,745 --> 00:26:29,946
One-oh-two.

554
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,580
Sound familiar ?

555
00:26:31,615 --> 00:26:34,884
Give you a clue.
Leon's nickname was Turbo.

556
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:36,819
One-oh-two-- the day he died.

557
00:26:36,953 --> 00:26:39,521
Now, you got photos of his
tags all over your office.

558
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,757
You know every single place that he hit.

559
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:42,892
So tell us.

560
00:26:42,926 --> 00:26:44,627
Who's Turbo, Don ?

561
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:47,029
I don't know.

562
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,802
I just wanted them to stop.

563
00:26:52,836 --> 00:26:55,538
I didn't think it would go that far.

564
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:00,576
When it's darkest, men see stars.

565
00:27:00,611 --> 00:27:02,145
When it's darkest, men see stars.

566
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:03,479
Don't be scared, Turbo.

567
00:27:04,613 --> 00:27:06,882
This spot's gonna make the angels weep.

568
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:11,620
I want to see stars, Carlos.

569
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,756
- You want stars ?
- Yeah.

570
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,291
You got stars.

571
00:27:15,325 --> 00:27:17,326
Let me see that first.

572
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,229
Emerson ?
Now who's that ?

573
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,365
You said there weren't any stars.

574
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:25,068
That's what you said.
Remember ?

575
00:27:25,302 --> 00:27:27,403
Did say that, but I was wrong.

576
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:29,038
All right.

577
00:27:29,872 --> 00:27:31,174
Check this out.

578
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,575
Freeze, you maggots !

579
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,911
Oh, somebody narced us out !
Come on ! Come on !

580
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,612
Come on ! Let's go ! Come on, killer.

581
00:27:36,646 --> 00:27:38,047
Come on, let's go !

582
00:27:45,788 --> 00:27:47,189
Come on, Turbo !

583
00:27:48,158 --> 00:27:49,325
You can do it !

584
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,494
Get you, you little bastard !

585
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,301
- Help ! Carlos !
- I got you, man.

586
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:01,570
- Carlos ! Help ! Carlos.
- I got you, man. I got you.

587
00:28:07,244 --> 00:28:08,544
Get out of here !

588
00:28:08,578 --> 00:28:10,646
I'll tell them it was just me.

589
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,914
Go before the cops come !

590
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:14,917
Go !

591
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:24,060
Night...

592
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:26,195
changed my life.

593
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:30,766
Can't fix what happened.

594
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:35,271
But I've tried to do some good.

595
00:28:38,406 --> 00:28:41,143
If Carlos was alive today,
I'm sure...

596
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:44,680
He'd be doing exactly
what I'm doing...

597
00:28:45,614 --> 00:28:47,583
Giving these kids some hope.

598
00:28:51,654 --> 00:28:53,489
What the hell was that, Kat ?

599
00:28:54,223 --> 00:28:55,625
I'm trying to help you out here.

600
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:57,159
I'm-I'm sorry.

601
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,061
I... I couldn't take it.

602
00:28:59,096 --> 00:29:00,796
Well, that much I got.

603
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:03,732
Look, if jarrod wants to see veronica,

604
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:06,535
He's gonna have to go to court.

605
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:08,170
Okay, I'm-I'm gonna have to warn you.

606
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,039
His-his lawyer's gonna present a guy

607
00:29:10,073 --> 00:29:12,040
who's been clean for five years.

608
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:15,043
I leave you alone at the table,
and now you're defending him ?

609
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:18,614
I'm just saying how it's
gonna look in court.

610
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:23,786
Look, judges try to give parents
contact with their children.

611
00:29:25,488 --> 00:29:27,189
No, this is different, Curtis.

612
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,591
He's an ex-banger.

613
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:31,027
You're not.

614
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,462
He's still her father.

615
00:29:33,496 --> 00:29:36,298
Not everyone deserves
a second chance.

616
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:42,805
I'm sorry you feel that way.

617
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:44,540
In my book,

618
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,976
Guy should be able to see his own kid.

619
00:30:33,022 --> 00:30:34,590
Ma'am ?

620
00:30:36,326 --> 00:30:38,227
- There a problem, lady ?
- No.

621
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:39,694
Got to move the car.

622
00:30:57,547 --> 00:31:00,816
Tracked the orange paint can
that Carlos was killed with.

623
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:03,585
Manufacturer sold it to harold's hardware.

624
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:05,154
Store where Gina worked.

625
00:31:05,188 --> 00:31:06,756
Excuse me.

626
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,057
I'm Eddie Clark.

627
00:31:08,091 --> 00:31:09,558
Work at the Fairhill soup kitchen.

628
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:11,526
Saw one of your posters.

629
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:12,962
I know this boy.

630
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,064
Was there when he painted
this piece.

631
00:31:15,098 --> 00:31:17,266
Don't hardly do it justice, though.

632
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,180
Beautiful, ain't it ?

633
00:31:32,315 --> 00:31:34,116
Just like I told you.

634
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,922
Spent a lot of time down here back then.

635
00:31:46,963 --> 00:31:47,996
Man, where...

636
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,532
Where did you learn how to do that ?

637
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,837
The streets.

638
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:58,273
Must be some damn angels on
the street you come from,

639
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:00,609
'cause I ain't never seen nothing like that.

640
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,579
Got us an artist in the sewer.

641
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,015
Ain't an artist.

642
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:09,852
You tell that to them.

643
00:32:11,486 --> 00:32:12,587
What you... ?

644
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,990
What you call it ?

645
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:18,627
When it's darkest,

646
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:20,296
Men see stars.

647
00:32:21,931 --> 00:32:23,765
That's what my friend always wanted.

648
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,801
You got a gift, brother.

649
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,237
A real gift.

650
00:32:30,973 --> 00:32:32,874
You could do something with that.

651
00:32:37,513 --> 00:32:39,014
What are they doing ?

652
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:42,084
Maybe they want to see stars, too.

653
00:32:51,494 --> 00:32:53,496
Still come down from time to time

654
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,264
to look at those stars.

655
00:32:55,698 --> 00:32:58,233
Remind myself how far I've come.

656
00:33:02,303 --> 00:33:03,605
You recognize those stars

657
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,041
- From gina's clothing line ?
- Yeah.

658
00:33:06,175 --> 00:33:09,244
Our famous designer said
she'd never seen this mural.

659
00:33:11,013 --> 00:33:12,214
"Dead on site.

660
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:14,083
Talon."

661
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,618
What kind of girlfriend
leaves a message like that?

662
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:23,525
Recognize this, Gina ?

663
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,461
So I capped his burner.

664
00:33:25,495 --> 00:33:26,795
Doesn't mean I hurt him.

665
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,931
You want to read that for us?

666
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:32,534
"dead on site."

667
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:34,536
It was just an empty threat.

668
00:33:34,571 --> 00:33:36,205
You two have an argument?

669
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:37,439
Almost 30 years ago ?

670
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,441
You can't expect me to
remember ancient history.

671
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,210
You've been pawning carlos' stars off

672
00:33:41,244 --> 00:33:42,745
as your own for nearly that long.

673
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,314
He wasn't the type to care if
somebody was biting his work.

674
00:33:45,348 --> 00:33:47,316
Orange paint can that killed carlos

675
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,685
was sold at harold's hardware.

676
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:52,421
It's not like you think.

677
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:54,757
I was all alone.

678
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:57,960
I needed his help...
but he wouldn't do it.

679
00:34:01,631 --> 00:34:04,533
Carlos, there you are.

680
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:06,468
Gina.

681
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:08,103
I've been looking for you.

682
00:34:08,138 --> 00:34:10,105
A junkie jumped me in the park.

683
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,907
Hey. I needed someone to watch my back.

684
00:34:11,941 --> 00:34:13,809
I couldn't find you.

685
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,880
<i>"Only you" by Yazoo.</i>

686
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:23,385
Leon died.

687
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,454
He fell.

688
00:34:28,258 --> 00:34:30,793
It's my fault
He was up there in the first place.

689
00:34:33,963 --> 00:34:36,698
The streets aren't safe.

690
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:37,933
That's why we need a crew.

691
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:41,003
Look.

692
00:34:42,806 --> 00:34:44,773
It's the most I ever racked from harold.

693
00:34:44,808 --> 00:34:46,475
Now we've got something to offer nrke.

694
00:34:46,509 --> 00:34:48,343
What do you want with those thugs ?

695
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,379
They've got a clubhouse,

696
00:34:50,413 --> 00:34:52,714
A place to stay at night.

697
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:55,717
Think they'll let you in their crew ?

698
00:34:55,752 --> 00:34:58,654
They will if you take me.

699
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,889
Tut said you can join them.

700
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:02,357
You don't get it.

701
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,562
They're bombing 'cause they're punks.

702
00:35:07,097 --> 00:35:08,697
I'm done with that.

703
00:35:09,631 --> 00:35:12,635
All right, I don't care
about getting my name up.

704
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,736
I want to do something.

705
00:35:17,707 --> 00:35:19,708
Help people.

706
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,076
In the sewer ?

707
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:22,811
Nobody's going to see
your work down here.

708
00:35:22,846 --> 00:35:25,214
They already have.

709
00:35:26,683 --> 00:35:29,818
Look, I want to do
something with this, Gina.

710
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:31,720
You could, too, if you'd just...

711
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,889
Bombers are getting clipped left and right.

712
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:34,890
Nrke is the only crew

713
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,493
Whose tags don't get taken down.

714
00:35:42,465 --> 00:35:44,266
You're right.

715
00:35:44,501 --> 00:35:46,435
Their tags never get buffed.

716
00:35:48,071 --> 00:35:50,072
Ever.

717
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,907
Get away.

718
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:54,443
I got to go do something.

719
00:35:54,477 --> 00:35:55,611
- No, no...
- Just wait right here.

720
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:56,545
Please don't leave me.

721
00:35:58,148 --> 00:35:59,447
I'll be back, I promise.

722
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,788
He never came back.

723
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:10,393
I was so mad, I slashed his mural.

724
00:36:11,027 --> 00:36:15,931
I heard the next day on the streets,
he'd been killed.

725
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,233
You said he took your paint ?

726
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:22,371
Five cannons of my signature orange.

727
00:36:23,106 --> 00:36:25,641
Know where he went ?

728
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:27,376
No.

729
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,912
He was right, though.

730
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:31,847
There's more to life than just bombing.

731
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:33,148
<i>Question is:</i>

732
00:36:33,183 --> 00:36:34,550
Where did he go with that paint?

733
00:36:34,584 --> 00:36:37,219
Yeah, only the one can
found at the crime scene.

734
00:36:37,253 --> 00:36:38,487
Wasn't any graffiti

735
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:39,488
In that alley.

736
00:36:39,522 --> 00:36:41,323
Look.

737
00:36:41,357 --> 00:36:44,659
The wall behind carlos's
body is completely bare.

738
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:46,028
It seem odd to you

739
00:36:46,062 --> 00:36:48,864
a whitewashed wall in nrke territory ?

740
00:36:48,898 --> 00:36:50,866
Would have been hit a hundred times.

741
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,068
That wall's got a story to tell.

742
00:36:53,102 --> 00:36:56,171
Let's peel back the layers.

743
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:11,253
*******

744
00:37:12,254 --> 00:37:14,623
Your liquor store, your gym,

745
00:37:14,657 --> 00:37:18,927
Your el stop, your dear mother's church.

746
00:37:18,962 --> 00:37:21,430
Playing a game-- this is your life ?

747
00:37:21,464 --> 00:37:22,965
Cops must be bored.

748
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:24,866
Sit up.

749
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:25,934
Listen to the lady.

750
00:37:26,169 --> 00:37:28,604
Above your liquor store,
Turbo 102.

751
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:31,373
On your gym marquee,
Turbo 102.

752
00:37:31,407 --> 00:37:35,043
On the church door, turbo 102.

753
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:36,311
That your tag ?

754
00:37:36,346 --> 00:37:37,646
Tut is my scribe.

755
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,747
Yeah, in the '80s.

756
00:37:38,781 --> 00:37:39,948
Then the mayor cracked down,

757
00:37:39,983 --> 00:37:40,817
you needed a new tag,

758
00:37:40,818 --> 00:37:42,318
one nobody could connect to you.

759
00:37:42,351 --> 00:37:44,419
That... That all you got, huh ?

760
00:37:44,454 --> 00:37:47,322
Random coincidence in my hood ?

761
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:49,259
Matched the paint samples
from turbo 102 with auto paint

762
00:37:49,293 --> 00:37:51,393
In your body shop.

763
00:37:51,427 --> 00:37:52,594
It's expensive, but...

764
00:37:52,629 --> 00:37:54,329
You get it wholesale, right ?

765
00:37:55,198 --> 00:37:58,467
You got me, I'm, I'm turbo 102.

766
00:38:01,003 --> 00:38:03,337
You stink like a rat.

767
00:38:03,372 --> 00:38:04,772
Who you calling a rat, man ?
I'm the king.

768
00:38:04,806 --> 00:38:06,708
Yeah, king snitch.

769
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:09,944
Made anonymous calls about
Carlos and his friend Leon.

770
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:11,012
I ain't no rat, man.

771
00:38:11,046 --> 00:38:13,982
Lowest life-form there is,
except for pigs.

772
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,122
Got something else you want to say, hmm ?

773
00:38:20,156 --> 00:38:22,124
Come on in, Don.

774
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:26,461
A snitch used to call him every day.

775
00:38:26,496 --> 00:38:27,496
Always the same voice.

776
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,664
Now he loves to talk.

777
00:38:28,698 --> 00:38:30,032
Go ahead, say something.

778
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:31,500
Say something !

779
00:38:31,534 --> 00:38:33,335
Son of a bitch,
you're a dead man, man !

780
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:35,871
That's him.

781
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:39,841
Sit your ass down. That's police brutality,

782
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,177
Man ! No, brutality is what they do
to snitches in the badlands.

783
00:38:42,211 --> 00:38:44,946
Other bombers found out,
you'd have been a walking corpse.

784
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:46,248
Carlos was about to share

785
00:38:46,482 --> 00:38:48,016
Your dirty secret with
the whole neighborhood.

786
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:50,052
You had to shut him up.

787
00:38:50,086 --> 00:38:51,453
Look, I tried to give that fool an out.

788
00:38:51,488 --> 00:38:52,521
- But he wouldn't take it.
- Little punk

789
00:38:52,555 --> 00:38:53,556
thought he was better
than me ! Yeah, thought

790
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,224
He could ruin your rep. Spent years

791
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:56,626
Getting up, building my name.

792
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,493
Yeah, you said a name was
the only thing you had in this world.

793
00:38:58,528 --> 00:39:00,429
Reason I took his.

794
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,164
Bitch thought he could
get me killed, thought

795
00:39:02,198 --> 00:39:03,532
He could be king.

796
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:09,504
There's only one king.

797
00:39:11,874 --> 00:39:14,042
what the hell you doing ?

798
00:39:14,877 --> 00:39:17,012
Been waiting for you to get here.

799
00:39:17,046 --> 00:39:19,781
Yeah, my boys been telling
me you been putting up lies.

800
00:39:19,915 --> 00:39:21,550
I'm here to take 'em down.

801
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:24,854
Your boys combing the streets
so you can rat us taggers out?

802
00:39:25,788 --> 00:39:27,423
"Turbo 102."

803
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:29,024
That's your new name ?

804
00:39:29,058 --> 00:39:30,726
I kind of like it.

805
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,061
That's my boy you got
killed with your snitching.

806
00:39:33,096 --> 00:39:35,864
Turbo 102.

807
00:39:35,898 --> 00:39:38,333
It's my tag now, bitch.

808
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:40,402
Don't even touch it.

809
00:39:40,436 --> 00:39:42,704
Leave it alone, man.

810
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:43,939
Said I'm gonna take it down.

811
00:39:43,973 --> 00:39:45,273
That's what I'm gonna do.

812
00:39:45,308 --> 00:39:46,508
I'll take it down myself

813
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:48,944
If you lay off other bombers.

814
00:39:48,978 --> 00:39:50,912
You giving me orders ?

815
00:39:50,947 --> 00:39:52,047
I'm the king !

816
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:55,751
It ain't about staying up.

817
00:39:55,785 --> 00:39:58,854
We can do more, change things around here--

818
00:39:58,888 --> 00:40:01,256
Everyone dying on the streets.

819
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,326
You high or something?

820
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,161
I said take it down.

821
00:40:08,397 --> 00:40:11,466
What's the life expectancy
for a snitch ?

822
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:14,102
Take it down.

823
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:16,204
You might as well not even exist.

824
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,473
Take... It... Down!

825
00:40:20,008 --> 00:40:21,710
Guess that's the only way
you're going to stay king

826
00:40:21,744 --> 00:40:24,112
'cause it sure as hell ain't
your skills doing the trick.

827
00:41:06,093 --> 00:41:10,093
