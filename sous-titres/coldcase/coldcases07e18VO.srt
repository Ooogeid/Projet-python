1
00:00:00,072 --> 00:00:02,772
La Philly Team présente...

2
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:06,673
........

3
00:00:08,873 --> 00:00:12,875
<i>"Just What I Needed"
by The Cars.</i>

4
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:19,357
Oh, come on, Barry.

5
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:20,692
I want to hear the movie.

6
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:21,959
I don't see anybody else watching.

7
00:00:21,994 --> 00:00:23,861
It's James Dean.

8
00:00:31,737 --> 00:00:32,970
Peach schnapps ?

9
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:34,405
That's your big move, Barry ?

10
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,107
I thought you liked peach schnapps.

11
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:38,209
Oh, who told you that ?
Shane Bannif ?

12
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:38,977
No.

13
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:40,646
Next time you see Shane,

14
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:42,747
ask him what happened
at Devil's Pool.

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,282
- He took you there ?
- Pumped me full

16
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:47,051
of peach schnapps,
said he wanted to jump the ledge.

17
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:48,653
- No way.
- Way.

18
00:00:48,687 --> 00:00:52,590
I jump, but Shane has some
last-minute shrinkage.

19
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:54,692
End of our big date.

20
00:00:56,628 --> 00:00:57,895
I'll take one of these.

21
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:02,466
Bottoms up.

22
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,484
Feels like we're being watched.

23
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,720
You want to go in the back ?

24
00:01:27,492 --> 00:01:29,260
Can you put the top up ?

25
00:01:29,894 --> 00:01:32,130
Yeah. Just don't move.

26
00:01:38,803 --> 00:01:40,938
Damn it. It's stuck.

27
00:01:41,072 --> 00:01:42,406
Well, unstick it.

28
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,247
You look...

29
00:01:50,582 --> 00:01:51,615
beautiful...

30
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:57,688
Help !

31
00:01:58,122 --> 00:01:59,556
Somebody help him !

32
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:14,004
Well, you look great, Diane.

33
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:16,641
Ah, capoeira, crunches,
six rounds at the heavy bag.

34
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:18,175
I never give an inch.

35
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:21,345
- Boss.
- Lil, I'd like you

36
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,147
to meet a friend of mine,
Diane Yates.

37
00:02:23,182 --> 00:02:24,148
Agent Yates, FBI.

38
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:26,484
This the one you
told me about, John ?

39
00:02:28,218 --> 00:02:29,720
Uh... something I can help
you with ?

40
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:31,055
Maybe.

41
00:02:31,089 --> 00:02:33,124
Diane got her start in the PPD.

42
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,792
18th District.

43
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:36,293
Wild West back then.

44
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:37,628
She blazed a trail for women.

45
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:38,930
Oh, that's a bunch of bull, Johnn

46
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:40,731
I got tired of being
groped by the boys club

47
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:42,800
and then being passed
up for promotion.

48
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:44,468
Ah, it's more
complicated than that.

49
00:02:44,503 --> 00:02:46,270
What, you want to compare
detective test scores ?

50
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:47,871
No.

51
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:49,573
They spot you ten points
for having a Y chromosome.

52
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:51,275
Well, it's not too long ago.

53
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,545
At least the Bureau was a
little bit more enlightened.

54
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,381
You back for memories or...

55
00:02:55,582 --> 00:02:56,982
coffee ?

56
00:02:57,715 --> 00:02:59,717
A case you worked on a while ago.

57
00:02:59,751 --> 00:03:00,785
The fresh job.

58
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,053
Mel Shaver.

59
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:04,021
Shot dead walking his dog.

60
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:05,923
Elmwood Park.
Suspected robbery,

61
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,891
went cold with no witnesses.

62
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:09,260
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.

63
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:11,762
- What's the FBI's interest in the job ?
- Classified.

64
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:13,565
Listen, I had a rough one
last night,

65
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,700
I need a fistful of Ibuprofen
or something stronger.

66
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:22,406
"Classified." Give me a break.

67
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,308
Well, just download
her on the case, Lil.

68
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:25,910
Maybe she can help us solve it.

69
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:29,947
Got some Ibuprofen in my desk.

70
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:33,284
Anything stronger ?

71
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:34,886
Mel Shaver, 43-year-old.

72
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,355
Tax lawyer, shot on November 6,

73
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:38,589
in Elmwood Park.

74
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,691
Recover any ballistics evidence ?

75
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:41,792
Through and through.

76
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:44,294
Gold Rolex, a wallet missing.

77
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,397
Got a string of
holdups in the area.

78
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:47,298
What else ?

79
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:49,199
Wife says he didn't
have any enemies.

80
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,201
- Solid citizen.
- What about habits ?

81
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:53,171
Crack or stripping his bark
in the woods ?

82
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:54,338
Nothing turned up.

83
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:56,440
Nothing turned up,
or you didn't ask ?

84
00:03:57,074 --> 00:03:58,242
I worked the case.

85
00:03:58,276 --> 00:03:59,843
There was nothing to go on.

86
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:03,981
It's a Percocet,
left over from an accident.

87
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:06,317
Shame not to finish a prescription.

88
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:08,052
I didn't need them.

89
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:12,523
Major Maurice Kitchener
got the end he deserved.

90
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:17,027
Run my name through
the Fed database ?

91
00:04:17,061 --> 00:04:18,762
Wouldn't exactly

92
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:20,398
describe you as a solid
citizen, Detective.

93
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:21,966
Though you lean that way.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,368
- I do my best.
- Of course you do.

95
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:26,136
What's this ?

96
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,539
It's a wooded area,
adjacent to the kill spot.

97
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:31,242
No, no, no. Here.

98
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,811
I need these blown up.

99
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:35,112
Get a high-res scan.

100
00:04:35,147 --> 00:04:36,480
This is Philadelphia.

101
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:39,750
We got one lab tech,
one copy machine and a two-week wait.

102
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:41,385
That's for a hot case.

103
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,853
I'll do it, then.

104
00:04:42,888 --> 00:04:45,423
So, is this the extent
of your investigation ?

105
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:47,224
Unless the FBI has
some new information.

106
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:48,459
No.

107
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:50,961
We're counting on you
having missed something.

108
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:53,263
Doubt it. Case is cold.

109
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,399
Start by re-interviewing the wife.

110
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:57,201
And do you need
approval from Daddy,

111
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:59,036
or can we just work this case ?

112
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,106
How exactly do you know Stillman ?

113
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,776
Johnny always gave me a
fair shake coming up.

114
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:07,545
All things considered.

115
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,013
Considering what ?

116
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:10,848
I broke up his marriage.

117
00:05:12,284 --> 00:05:22,253
Cold Case
Season 7 Episode 18

118
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:43,092
The last drive-in (Part 1)

119
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:56,628
Hey.

120
00:05:58,062 --> 00:05:59,496
Hey.

121
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:03,233
- You want a piece of me ?
- Nah.

122
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:05,536
Just came to see
how you were doing.

123
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,408
Well, five hours a day I get
to talk about my feelings.

124
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:13,544
Can't sleep 'cause my
roommate's up every five minutes

125
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,779
washing the germs off his hands,

126
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:18,249
and lecturing me
about palm oils in my diet.

127
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:19,450
Highlight of the day

128
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:22,186
is taking on my fellow
detectives in ping-pong,

129
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:24,255
but other than that
things are looking up.

130
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:25,890
How's the Jell-O ?

131
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:27,391
Not bad.

132
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:29,193
Mac and cheese sucks.

133
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:32,330
Look.

134
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:34,265
Portable DVD player.

135
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:36,801
Thank you.

136
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:39,136
"The Honeymooners."

137
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:40,838
"The Godfather One."

138
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:41,906
Two.

139
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,708
"Midnight Run."

140
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:47,044
"The Cutting Edge" ?

141
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,013
It's a guilty pleasure.

142
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:50,514
Mine, too.

143
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:51,682
Between us.

144
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,289
D.A., uh, reopened
the Billingsley case.

145
00:07:01,193 --> 00:07:03,461
Fat lot of good that does Joe Don.

146
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,464
Come on.

147
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,367
All right.

148
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:11,401
Has there been a break
in the case ?

149
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:13,371
It's a routine reinvestigation.

150
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:15,273
Why is the FBI interested?

151
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:17,575
Quite a collection.

152
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:19,810
My husband bought those for me.

153
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:20,911
Cute.

154
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:22,514
What kind of man was your husband ?

155
00:07:22,548 --> 00:07:24,482
I know what you're asking.

156
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:25,583
We had a good marriage.

157
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:27,351
What, because he bought you
these ?

158
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:30,188
And he was very thoughtful.

159
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:31,722
Sounds like.

160
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,359
I'm sorry. I don't see

161
00:07:35,393 --> 00:07:36,561
what this has to
do with his murder ?

162
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:39,397
If you could just tell us
what happened that night.

163
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:42,233
Mel took our dog for a walk

164
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:44,935
and was killed by a stranger.

165
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,237
One minute

166
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:47,706
you're planning a trip to
the Galapagos

167
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,908
and the next you're shopping
funerary urns.

168
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:53,177
Did he ever live or
work in Upper Darby ?

169
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:57,415
- Not that I know of.
- Anywhere in Delaware County ?

170
00:07:58,249 --> 00:07:59,383
He was a homebody.

171
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:01,052
Meaning what ? You'd just sit around

172
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:04,355
sipping Sleepytime Tea
and watching "60 Minutes" ?

173
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:06,824
Mel worked.

174
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:08,559
He watched the Phillies.

175
00:08:08,593 --> 00:08:10,494
He took walks.

176
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:12,065
Our big excitement was...

177
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:13,866
dinner and a movie.

178
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:15,966
Did he ever mention the
Darby View Drive-In ?

179
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:17,435
Drive-In ?

180
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,273
This is going to help solve
my husband's murder ?

181
00:08:21,307 --> 00:08:22,907
Oh, just answer the question.

182
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:24,975
I think I want you to leave.

183
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,910
Interesting interrogation technique.

184
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:30,181
You're a hand-holder.
It works sometimes.

185
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:32,249
- That woman lost her husband.
- I got that.

186
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:34,485
As well as he liked the
Phillies and walks in the park.

187
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,287
It's a tragic loss, to be sure.

188
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:37,655
Well, she might've
given us something.

189
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:39,990
I'm looking for connections,
not Facebook friends.

190
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:41,559
She didn't know who
killed her husband,

191
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:43,694
and I needed to know that.

192
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,531
Boss said these belong to you.

193
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,233
Diane Yates.

194
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:51,302
Scotty Valens.

195
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:52,770
You two partners ?

196
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:57,141
What type of name is that, Valens ?

197
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:59,043
Italian ? Mexican ?

198
00:08:59,077 --> 00:09:00,612
Cuban, Puerto Rican.

199
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:02,446
As in Valenzuela.

200
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:04,248
It's a shame to shorten that.

201
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:06,650
I dated a Latino once.

202
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:08,853
All talk, no follow through.

203
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:11,255
You're dating the wrong Latinos.

204
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,657
Well, I guess so.

205
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:15,960
How about you put those pretty
brown eyes of yours to good use ?

206
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:17,695
And don't worry, I don't bite.

207
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:19,263
Anymore.

208
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:26,070
I got grass, trees,

209
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:28,140
rocks, park bench.

210
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,910
Mmm, there's something here.

211
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,700
Could be a homeless squat.

212
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,910
I don't recall an
interview in the file.

213
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,870
They must've split
when they saw the cops.

214
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,790
Yeah, but it'd be nice to
know if he saw something.

215
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,350
I'll call patrol.
Talk to the beat cop.

216
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,120
I miss a spot shaving ?

217
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,780
Just looking.

218
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,680
Thinking you'd fit right in
at the Bureau.

219
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,380
You fill out a suit nicely,

220
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,750
and I'm sure you're
good at sucking up.

221
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,780
- Minority doesn't hurt.
- Yeah.

222
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,460
I'll get right on that.

223
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,060
So, what's the Bureau want
with this case, anyway ?

224
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,690
What's it like working
with the bleach queen ?

225
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,070
Well, Lil and I make a good team.

226
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,120
Oh, I bet.

227
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,590
It's not like that.

228
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,060
You're not her type ?

229
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,980
Thanks.

230
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,490
Guy we're looking for
is Carl Guidry.

231
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,600
The bum in the park.

232
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,870
Patrol picked him up last week

233
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:27,671
for a visit to the psych ward.

234
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,940
At St. Paul's.

235
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,930
You remember this place, Carl ?

236
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,360
Yes.

237
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,400
You stay there sometimes?

238
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,890
Under my tree.

239
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,700
Well, a man was shot
and killed there last November.

240
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,160
And we think you
might've seen it happen.

241
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,530
No,I did not.

242
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,860
It was right here by the path.

243
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,770
He was walking a dog.

244
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,860
No, ma'am.

245
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,860
Final answer.

246
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,100
Carl ?

247
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,280
We know everything, Carl.

248
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,420
Everything inside
that head of yours.

249
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,110
Even that girl.

250
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,480
You have a problem with people
reading your thoughts ?

251
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,410
I want it to stop.

252
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,440
I can help you with that.

253
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,470
First, you have to help us.

254
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,370
Take that.

255
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,270
It'll keep the intruders out.

256
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,980
Is that better ?

257
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,670
I think so.

258
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,180
It must be working.

259
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,580
Can I have another ?

260
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,150
After you tell us
about the shooting.

261
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,880
Okay.

262
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,510
I was right-right there.

263
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,930
You leave when you saw the police ?

264
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,930
I didn't want no trouble.

265
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,340
The man in the green jacket,
Carl...

266
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:07,841
what was he doing to the body ?

267
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,930
Taking that gold watch.

268
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:11,980
I suppose.

269
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,110
How'd you know about
that watch, Carl?

270
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,520
Did you take the watch, Carl ?

271
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,730
I took a few things.

272
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,330
There goes robbery as a motive.

273
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:30,655
But the shooter checked the body.

274
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,791
Making sure there was no bullet
left behind.

275
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:36,026
Get something off the homeless guy ?

276
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:37,294
Saw the shooter.

277
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:38,829
That's good.

278
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:41,098
So,

279
00:12:41,132 --> 00:12:43,300
Yates and Stillman had a thing.

280
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:45,302
A thing, thing ?

281
00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:46,937
It was what she said.

282
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:48,606
Yeah, broke up his marriage.

283
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:51,409
The bigger issue is,

284
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:53,410
Cougar Town won't let
me in on what the Fed''

285
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:54,878
interest in this case is.

286
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:57,748
Might have a connect to
Darby in Delaware County.

287
00:12:57,782 --> 00:13:00,184
Yeah, I'll dig around,
see what I can find.

288
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:01,952
Diane,

289
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:03,120
I want you to meet another member

290
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:05,089
- of my team, Kat Miller.
- Can I talk to you ?

291
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,092
Nice to meet you, too.

292
00:13:08,126 --> 00:13:10,761
- You promised to keep me in the loop.
- I will.

293
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:13,130
But first I need Rush to walk
me through the crime scene.

294
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:19,536
Shaver enters the park
approximately 9:30.

295
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:23,774
I figure he keeps
to the lighted path.

296
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,746
The killer waited in the bushes
till he rounds the corner.

297
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,081
Confronts Shaver, and maybe
something happens with the dog,

298
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:32,983
or Shaver resists.

299
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:38,656
Shot came from over there.

300
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,626
With a handgun ?

301
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,294
It's got to be 100 yards.

302
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:45,462
He used a rifle.

303
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:48,165
Not a lot of thugs using long guns.

304
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:51,502
Shaver enters the shooting lane

305
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:52,903
illuminated by the street lamp.

306
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:56,040
It's a perfect shot.

307
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:57,875
It puts the trajectory...

308
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:04,282
...here.

309
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:08,652
You gonna tell me what's going on ?

310
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:11,488
We got to get this
back to ballistics.

311
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:12,957
Look, I don't give a crap

312
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,126
how far back you and Stillman go.

313
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,694
Want to keep shining me on,
go ahead.

314
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:18,395
I'll call my own friend
in the Bureau.

315
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,064
I'm your friend in the Bureau.

316
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,668
We have a serial killer, a sniper.

317
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:26,336
Are there other cases
to back this up ?

318
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:29,740
'Cause I don't recall
other unsolveds with a rifle.

319
00:14:29,774 --> 00:14:32,009
Last one was 27 years ago,

320
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:34,678
and it looks like he came out
of retirement.

321
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:44,771
- Where's Yates ?
- Down at ballistics.

322
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:46,238
Found this.

323
00:14:47,473 --> 00:14:50,243
- Darby View Drive-In, 1980.
- Shooting never solved.

324
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:52,879
Only evidence was a rifle bullet
recovered from the victim...

325
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:54,313
25.06.

326
00:14:54,348 --> 00:14:57,850
Well, Yates thinks the Shaver murder
is the work of a serial sniper.

327
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:02,221
Might have heard if a sniper was picking
off folks in our backyard.

328
00:15:02,255 --> 00:15:03,690
And they sent one agent ?

329
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,391
Feds come two to a box.

330
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:07,393
Well, I figure,
boss vouches for her,

331
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:08,628
she must be good.

332
00:15:08,862 --> 00:15:12,799
What if the task force blows in
and starts barking orders ?

333
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:17,737
Hey.

334
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:19,138
Hey.

335
00:15:19,672 --> 00:15:21,040
Kicked me early.

336
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:24,944
Got those files from the
Billingsley case for you.

337
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:27,013
Just coffee, Fay.

338
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:30,215
Trying to help the family out,
you know ?

339
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,483
You talk to the warden ?

340
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:34,087
They investigated
Joe Don's shanking.

341
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:36,622
It turns out, he cut the chow line,

342
00:15:36,657 --> 00:15:38,057
the gang took offense.

343
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:41,026
Well, that's on me.

344
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:44,496
No, you can't keep beating
yourself up about this, Nick.

345
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:46,332
No, I can't look the
other way, either.

346
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:48,368
Well, do the work,
get your head right.

347
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:50,769
What's that supposed to mean ?

348
00:15:51,204 --> 00:15:52,605
Well, it means,
it's gonna be a while

349
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,074
before you're cleared
back to active duty.

350
00:15:56,108 --> 00:15:57,443
I'm good to go.

351
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,514
Worked with a guy in Vice.

352
00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:03,849
He had a meltdown,
his wife left him.

353
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:05,351
Substance abuse.

354
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:07,853
Brass had him take a powder.

355
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:09,821
Yeah ?

356
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:12,424
Well, he was chomping at the bit
to get back on the line.

357
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:15,328
He got cleared,
comes back all smiles.

358
00:16:15,962 --> 00:16:18,831
Two weeks later, I found
him dead in his squad car.

359
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:24,270
I'm not that guy.

360
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,941
Take as much time
as you need, Nick.

361
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:32,678
We'll be here for you
when you're ready.

362
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,752
You got to fluff half
the boys in the lab

363
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:41,487
to get a report back around here.

364
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:43,155
Come back a 25.06 ?

365
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:46,993
Same bullet that
killed Barry Jensen

366
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:48,561
at the Darby View Drive-In.

367
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:50,430
Nice.

368
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:53,633
Yes.

369
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,302
Preliminary ballistics
makes it a match.

370
00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:57,804
Well, the same shooter then ?

371
00:16:57,838 --> 00:16:58,905
You think ?

372
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:03,242
You know, if you want my help,
you need to tell me what's going on.

373
00:17:05,044 --> 00:17:06,545
How about we get a drink ?

374
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,380
If you're 12-stepping,

375
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:10,750
you can sip diet soda
and silently judge me.

376
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:15,454
I can attribute five shootings
to our guy.

377
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:16,922
Victims linked ?

378
00:17:16,957 --> 00:17:18,191
If only.

379
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:20,159
Kid on his way to college,

380
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:23,563
bus driver, secretary, roofer,

381
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:25,598
and now the tax attorney.

382
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:27,600
And the first one at the drive-in.

383
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:30,736
Three more after that, and then,
nothing for 27 years.

384
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,972
I thought he was dead or in prison.

385
00:17:33,306 --> 00:17:35,475
Then the Shaver shooting pops.

386
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:37,910
Same MO : a single
shot to the chest.

387
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:39,912
No bullet left behind.

388
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:42,381
You've been hunting
this guy for 30 years ?

389
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,550
Oh, I must have chased
down a dozen cases

390
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:45,852
I thought fit the pattern.

391
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:48,554
- Calling in the task force ?
- Nope.

392
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:51,757
First homicide was right
around the corner here.

393
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:53,392
Frank's Coffee Shop.

394
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:56,796
Double murder : waitress, manager.

395
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,098
First on the scene ?

396
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:01,299
Took initial statements,

397
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:03,636
and right away I liked
the busboy for it.

398
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,171
And then the detectives show up.

399
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:07,640
Oh. Yeah, didn't see
it the same way.

400
00:18:07,674 --> 00:18:08,774
No. I try telling 'em,

401
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:12,044
but they liked the
ex-con grill cook.

402
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:14,146
The lead laughed in my face.

403
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,183
Told me to shut my trap and
secure his crime scene.

404
00:18:17,317 --> 00:18:19,452
Oh, I remember a few
of those myself.

405
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:21,687
Well, last thing we need
is some Fed profiler

406
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:23,956
telling us what kind of
underwear our shooter favors,

407
00:18:23,991 --> 00:18:25,691
or that he had mommy issues.

408
00:18:28,061 --> 00:18:30,096
Another round.

409
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,731
One for him.

410
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:38,738
Amstel Light at the end of the bar
is kind of cute.

411
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:43,042
You seeing anyone ?

412
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:44,243
Was.

413
00:18:44,277 --> 00:18:45,578
Another cop ?

414
00:18:45,912 --> 00:18:47,046
Yeah.

415
00:18:49,182 --> 00:18:51,650
You're looking for the real thing.

416
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:52,885
Good luck.

417
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,220
Only took me 30 years,

418
00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:56,188
but I stopped believing
in that nonsense

419
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:58,257
when I figured out what men want.

420
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,225
What's that ?

421
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:01,894
A girlfriend, not a wife.

422
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:14,706
All right, Philly P.D.

423
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:17,709
will work jointly with
Agent Yates and the FBI.

424
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:19,111
Got five shootings.

425
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:22,147
The first in 1980,
the last five months ago.

426
00:19:22,182 --> 00:19:24,183
Agent Yates will run
the rest for you.

427
00:19:24,217 --> 00:19:26,251
With the exception of
the first shooting,

428
00:19:26,286 --> 00:19:27,987
the killer chose
isolated targets,

429
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:29,888
minimizing his exposure.

430
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:31,390
This guy is patient, smart,

431
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:32,692
and careful.

432
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:34,560
Safe to assume military service.

433
00:19:34,595 --> 00:19:37,196
Four victims either lived,
worked or had ties

434
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,364
to Delaware County.

435
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:39,733
First victim, Barry Jensen,

436
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:41,334
shot at a drive-in, 1980.

437
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:42,835
- Any witnesses ?
- No.

438
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:44,937
I've already done the legwork on that.
There's nothing there.

439
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:45,972
Felicity Andrews, secretary.

440
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:49,675
Shot in her car in
New Jersey in 1981.

441
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:52,077
Assigned theorized a
carjacking gone wrong.

442
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:54,714
Preston Schmall, part-time roofer,
shot in the Poconos

443
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:56,349
while camping, 1982.

444
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:58,751
Next was Fred Norris,
a bus driver,

445
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:00,920
shot in '83 near the bus grounds.

446
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:02,422
And now Shaver,
the tax attorney,

447
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:04,256
shot just five months ago.

448
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,224
Any casing recovered ?

449
00:20:05,258 --> 00:20:07,727
No, but we have the bullet
that killed Shaver.

450
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:09,528
Matches the first victim, 1980.

451
00:20:09,563 --> 00:20:11,130
All right, re-interview
family, friends,

452
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:12,398
any folks at those scenes.

453
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:13,966
See if something was missing.

454
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:17,336
Interview the bus driver.

455
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,739
Oh. You want me to
interview the bus driver ?

456
00:20:20,774 --> 00:20:22,108
Well, you can relate culturally.

457
00:20:22,142 --> 00:20:24,143
Just right on the surface, huh ?

458
00:20:24,277 --> 00:20:25,511
You got a problem with that,

459
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:28,280
report me to Reverend Al
after we find this guy.

460
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:31,217
Why are y'all coming
around now on Fred ?

461
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:32,652
Reopening his murder.

462
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:34,253
Well, it's about time.

463
00:20:34,387 --> 00:20:35,855
You two friends?

464
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:37,690
Played tonk every Friday night.

465
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:39,958
Didn't have any family.

466
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:42,028
Just the regulars on his route.

467
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:44,429
What happened that night, Calvin ?

468
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:47,366
Well, I was getting
ready for my next shift.

469
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:50,302
Catching some z's
on the bus, and...

470
00:20:51,537 --> 00:20:53,505
and that's when I...
that's when I heard it.

471
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:20,133
Freddie ?

472
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:23,235
- Hey, what are you doing ?
- Get help !

473
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:24,904
He's been shot !

474
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:28,641
I thought it was one
of Freddie's jokes.

475
00:21:28,775 --> 00:21:30,576
We were always pranking each other.

476
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,378
This other guy... black? White?

477
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:35,114
White. When I came back

478
00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:36,782
from making the phone call,
he was gone.

479
00:21:36,816 --> 00:21:38,650
Anything you remember about him ?

480
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:41,387
Green Army jacket.

481
00:21:42,621 --> 00:21:44,556
Just never made any sense to me.

482
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:47,725
Felicity was going
to get her radiology degree.

483
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,162
And you worked together before she took
the job at the high school ?

484
00:21:50,197 --> 00:21:51,764
At Philly Savings and Loan.

485
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:54,133
- Secretaries ?
- Executive assistants.

486
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:57,002
Just a nicer way
of saying the same thing.

487
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:58,470
We covered for the loan officers

488
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:00,405
making promises they couldn't keep.

489
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,941
Were there a lot of angry folks
back then ?

490
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:04,243
Oh, you bet.

491
00:22:04,277 --> 00:22:06,878
Spent most of the time answering phones,
getting yelled at.

492
00:22:07,113 --> 00:22:09,181
Felicity get in the
middle of something ?

493
00:22:09,216 --> 00:22:11,617
I remember this one
guy who kept calling,

494
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:14,018
but that was years
before she was murdered.

495
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:15,054
You got a name ?

496
00:22:15,388 --> 00:22:16,488
Just a nickname.

497
00:22:17,123 --> 00:22:18,790
Mr. 6.83.

498
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:21,961
A rate the manager
promised him but couldn't deliver.

499
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:28,901
Wanna get lunch ?

500
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:30,736
They have a new salad
bar at Maxwell's.

501
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,275
Felicity, aren't you
going to answer it ?

502
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:39,111
I can't. It's him, I just know it.

503
00:22:39,145 --> 00:22:40,712
Mr. 6.83 ?

504
00:22:40,747 --> 00:22:42,014
He called three times
this morning, and I think

505
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:44,883
he followed me into the
parking lot the other day.

506
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,253
Philly Savings and Loan.

507
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:49,888
<i>I want answers.</i>

508
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:51,891
<i>You promised me that rate.</i>

509
00:22:51,925 --> 00:22:53,058
And I want a new Cadillac

510
00:22:53,093 --> 00:22:55,294
and a boyfriend that looks
like Robert Redford.

511
00:22:55,328 --> 00:22:56,095
Nance !

512
00:22:56,129 --> 00:22:57,229
<i>Where is she ?</i>

513
00:22:57,264 --> 00:22:58,964
<i>The blonde that keeps lying to me,</i>

514
00:22:58,998 --> 00:23:00,866
<i>saying that my loan's
gonna go through ?</i>

515
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,568
Would you like to
speak to a manager?

516
00:23:02,602 --> 00:23:04,336
<i>You're all liars.</i>

517
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,071
Drop dead, creep !

518
00:23:07,572 --> 00:23:10,572
<i>"Strange way" by Firewall.</i>

519
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:16,248
It got so bad, she finally quit.

520
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:17,650
Good thing, 'cause the bank

521
00:23:17,684 --> 00:23:19,118
went belly up a year later.

522
00:23:19,152 --> 00:23:20,386
Did she know this guy's name?

523
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,854
I don't remember.

524
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:25,457
Like I said, there were
a lot of angry people

525
00:23:25,492 --> 00:23:26,959
with the recession and all.

526
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:31,864
So, you were there
when Preston was shot ?

527
00:23:33,498 --> 00:23:35,034
Not exactly.

528
00:23:35,768 --> 00:23:38,537
You told police that you
were on the trail with him.

529
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:42,575
I wasn't with him
at the time.

530
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:44,543
- Did you see the shooter ?
- No.

531
00:23:44,578 --> 00:23:47,413
The police said it was a
stray bullet from a poacher.

532
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:49,548
So, you went hiking
but just not together ?

533
00:23:51,284 --> 00:23:53,752
We weren't exactly getting along.

534
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:57,456
We went camping
hoping to reconnect.

535
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,824
A little late.

536
00:23:58,858 --> 00:24:01,760
You filed for separation a
week before he was killed.

537
00:24:03,663 --> 00:24:05,030
Did you tell him?

538
00:24:07,234 --> 00:24:09,969
We argued, he ran into the woods.

539
00:24:10,003 --> 00:24:11,670
That's the last time I saw him.

540
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:14,073
Why lie about being there
when he was shot?

541
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:18,277
It was like that police officer knew.

542
00:24:18,311 --> 00:24:19,345
Knew what?

543
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:21,447
That it was my fault somehow.

544
00:24:21,481 --> 00:24:23,415
It felt like I'd been set free.

545
00:24:23,449 --> 00:24:26,352
I know that sounds terrible,
but it's the truth.

546
00:24:26,786 --> 00:24:28,320
A happy accident.

547
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:31,095
It's funny, I hadn't thought
about Preston in years.

548
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:34,308
And then, last month, I ran into
a sister and she told me that...

549
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,101
One of his gambling buddies

550
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:38,202
had been shut upstate New York.

551
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:39,221
Shot and killed ?

552
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:40,262
No,

553
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:41,563
he survived.

554
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:44,475
You don't think
there's a connection, do you ?

555
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:47,444
- Can you give us a name ?
- Tim Hudson.

556
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:51,548
He'd hire Preston to
help him repo cars.

557
00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:54,784
Bus driver saw the
killer at the scene.

558
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:55,952
Checking for a bullet ?

559
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:57,888
Trying to,
until he was interrupted.

560
00:24:57,922 --> 00:24:59,322
What about the secretary ?

561
00:24:59,357 --> 00:25:01,858
A disgruntled bank customer
might've been stalking her.

562
00:25:01,893 --> 00:25:03,293
Pull the loan records
from that period, Scotty,

563
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,327
match them against

564
00:25:04,362 --> 00:25:06,162
military servers,
people in the system.

565
00:25:06,197 --> 00:25:07,798
Well, we got something.

566
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:09,900
Found a survivor, Tim Hudson.

567
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:12,369
Worked as a repo man
with victim number three.

568
00:25:12,403 --> 00:25:14,037
Preston Schmall.

569
00:25:14,071 --> 00:25:15,672
Wounded in a drug-related shooting.

570
00:25:18,675 --> 00:25:21,044
Remember how I said I'd
keep you in the loop ?

571
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:23,880
You know, I'm cutting you
a lot of slack, Diane,

572
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:25,749
on account of our history.

573
00:25:25,783 --> 00:25:27,217
This guy's out there,
John, I know it.

574
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:30,020
I'm gonna protect my people
if it turns into a turf war.

575
00:25:30,054 --> 00:25:31,388
It's not going to.

576
00:25:31,422 --> 00:25:33,690
Besides, Rush doesn't
need any protecting.

577
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:35,258
I just want that out there.

578
00:25:35,392 --> 00:25:37,961
Let's put away the badges, huh ?

579
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,063
Sorry.

580
00:25:41,532 --> 00:25:45,101
Always did take you three
drinks to loosen up.

581
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,104
How's your mother ?

582
00:25:49,974 --> 00:25:52,042
She can't remember my name.

583
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,811
She spends her days
listening to the radio

584
00:25:56,345 --> 00:25:58,181
and humming to herself.

585
00:25:58,215 --> 00:25:59,649
Well, it happens.

586
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:01,718
When that day comes,
shoot me dead.

587
00:26:01,752 --> 00:26:04,020
Here's to knowing when to fold.

588
00:26:08,593 --> 00:26:10,927
It's been a long time, John.

589
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,464
Too long.

590
00:26:15,566 --> 00:26:17,367
No hard feelings.

591
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:20,770
I wasn't a boy.
We both knew the game.

592
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:23,306
I wasn't the one married.

593
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,811
Ah, it would've ended, anyway.

594
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:34,684
Another one ?

595
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:35,852
I better not.

596
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,488
I don't wanna regret
anything in the morning.

597
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:42,592
I won't if you won't.

598
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:48,299
You know what ?

599
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:51,234
I'm toast.

600
00:26:51,668 --> 00:26:53,136
Why don't you give me a ride home ?

601
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,406
I...

602
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:56,707
I'll call you a cab

603
00:26:59,276 --> 00:27:01,611
Grab your keys and take me home.

604
00:27:02,146 --> 00:27:05,582
Or I'll get one of these
other young bucks to do it.

605
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:32,158
Remember Preston ?

606
00:27:33,992 --> 00:27:35,428
Hard guy to forget.

607
00:27:36,762 --> 00:27:37,995
What'd he do ?

608
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,597
He was shot and killed in '82.

609
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:43,134
Must've rubbed the
wrong person the wrong way.

610
00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:46,103
Preston wasn't half as charming
as he thought he was.

611
00:27:46,237 --> 00:27:49,273
A little odd that Preston
gets shot and killed

612
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:52,510
and then a year later,
you get shot ?

613
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,412
Police said it was
probably a stickup.

614
00:27:54,446 --> 00:27:55,480
Probably ?

615
00:27:56,214 --> 00:27:58,215
Ah, I had to take
their word for it.

616
00:27:58,249 --> 00:27:59,517
Why is that ?

617
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:02,418
Fifth of Old Crow,
half a dozen beeners,

618
00:28:02,553 --> 00:28:04,255
a little herb to even it all out.

619
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:06,390
One minute I'm sailing,
the next minute

620
00:28:06,424 --> 00:28:07,691
I'm waking up in the hospital

621
00:28:07,726 --> 00:28:09,627
and they're telling me
I'll never walk again.

622
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:11,896
You don't remember anything ?

623
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:14,131
I got whole years missing, lady.

624
00:28:14,665 --> 00:28:17,168
Cops said I was in a bad
hood trying to score.

625
00:28:17,402 --> 00:28:19,070
Sounds good to me.

626
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:23,074
It's like the hand of God just
came down and gave me a crack.

627
00:28:23,108 --> 00:28:24,609
Just changed your ways, huh ?

628
00:28:24,643 --> 00:28:26,811
Been clean and sober ever since.

629
00:28:26,845 --> 00:28:29,113
Of course I, uh, can't walk.

630
00:28:29,148 --> 00:28:31,349
But that is a small price to pay

631
00:28:31,383 --> 00:28:33,551
for getting me off
the road I was on.

632
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:37,522
You and Preston work
for a repo company ?

633
00:28:37,556 --> 00:28:39,123
Hmm, just me.

634
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:40,792
Recession was good for business.

635
00:28:40,826 --> 00:28:43,494
I had so much work,
I'd toss Preston a couple of bucks

636
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:44,729
now and then to give me a hand,

637
00:28:44,763 --> 00:28:46,697
especially if I was
in a bad neighborhood.

638
00:28:46,732 --> 00:28:48,065
Why is that ?

639
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,801
People don't exactly invite
you in for milk and cookies

640
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:51,002
when you're taking their car

641
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:53,104
or their color TV.

642
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:55,273
You guys ever get into
it with a customer?

643
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:57,442
Oh, from time to time.

644
00:28:57,476 --> 00:28:59,544
Mostly words. Well, maybe a vet

645
00:28:59,578 --> 00:29:02,046
or, you know,
a guy in the military.

646
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,614
One guy I remember.

647
00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:06,784
Intense son of a bitch.

648
00:29:09,785 --> 00:29:13,785
<i>"Even the losers" by Tom Petty.</i>

649
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:23,667
Come on, man.

650
00:29:33,578 --> 00:29:35,546
Hey! What the hell do
you think you're doing?!

651
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,548
You're behind six
months on your payments.

652
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,783
Just doing our jobs, man.

653
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:40,351
Oh, what, take things
that don't belong to you?!

654
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:41,852
The car belongs to the bank now.

655
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:44,322
Come on, man, I need that
car to get to my job.

656
00:29:44,356 --> 00:29:45,590
Here's an idea.

657
00:29:45,624 --> 00:29:46,957
Get a bus pass.

658
00:29:48,092 --> 00:29:49,360
I was gonna pay.

659
00:29:49,594 --> 00:29:51,629
Come on, I can't afford
to lose this job, guys.

660
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,397
Unless you can pay
the delinquent amount

661
00:29:53,432 --> 00:29:56,400
in full right now...

662
00:29:57,436 --> 00:29:59,871
Times are tough, boudreaux.

663
00:29:59,905 --> 00:30:01,172
Knock it off, Preston.

664
00:30:02,274 --> 00:30:03,474
Hey, you serve ?

665
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:04,909
Yeah, what about it ?

666
00:30:05,243 --> 00:30:07,311
First Division, Bravo Company.

667
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:10,014
So, we're supposed to give
you the Semper Fi break ?

668
00:30:10,148 --> 00:30:11,215
Can't do that.

669
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:12,783
Look, I come back empty-handed,

670
00:30:12,818 --> 00:30:14,485
guess what? I lose my job.

671
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,053
Come on, I'm trying real hard

672
00:30:16,087 --> 00:30:17,321
here, man. Try harder.

673
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:19,890
Back off ! Stop it !

674
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:21,391
Hey, hey, stop !

675
00:30:21,426 --> 00:30:22,761
Stop ! Hey !

676
00:30:25,097 --> 00:30:27,598
Someday somebody's gonna take
something from you, pal.

677
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:29,299
Something real important.

678
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:30,801
And you're gonna remember me

679
00:30:30,836 --> 00:30:32,970
- when that happens.
- Go back inside.

680
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:34,739
You wait.

681
00:30:34,773 --> 00:30:37,308
You're gonna get yours, boudreaux.

682
00:30:43,082 --> 00:30:44,749
Marines don't make idle threats.

683
00:30:44,783 --> 00:30:45,983
They take action.

684
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:47,552
He was pretty steamed,

685
00:30:47,586 --> 00:30:49,954
but, uh, this was years
before I got shot.

686
00:30:49,988 --> 00:30:52,123
- You remember a name ?
- Just the car.

687
00:30:52,157 --> 00:30:54,091
Ford Torino.

688
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:57,361
Must've been '76 or so.

689
00:30:58,562 --> 00:30:59,762
Boss...

690
00:31:00,031 --> 00:31:01,732
Boss, pulled repo company records.

691
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:03,934
A dozen cars match
Hudson's description.

692
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:05,703
We cross-referenced
the names with Philly

693
00:31:05,737 --> 00:31:07,238
Savings and Loans records,
got a hit.

694
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:10,174
Bill Shepard, ex-Marine,
served in Vietnam.

695
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:12,577
Well, he knows his
way around a gun.

696
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:14,245
Owned the Darby View Drive-In.

697
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,513
Tried to get a loan.

698
00:31:15,547 --> 00:31:16,647
Connected to every victim

699
00:31:16,715 --> 00:31:18,215
except the bus driver
and Mel Shaver.

700
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,951
Shepard went off the
grid in the '80's.

701
00:31:19,985 --> 00:31:22,453
No credit card statements,
zero bank activity.

702
00:31:22,487 --> 00:31:24,489
Yates ran the name
through the FBI database

703
00:31:24,523 --> 00:31:25,590
and got a hit.

704
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:28,125
Lifetime subscriber to The
Long Rifle Review.

705
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:29,393
That a crime?

706
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:31,962
Post-Oklahoma City,
gets you on a watch list.

707
00:31:31,997 --> 00:31:34,765
Searching tax records trying
to track down an address.

708
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,335
Rush located his son, Paul Shepard.

709
00:31:39,504 --> 00:31:40,671
A month overdue.

710
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:43,140
And it's my fault I
gotta charge late fees.

711
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:45,576
Agent Yates.
This is Detective Rush.

712
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:47,612
Looking for your father,
Bill Shepard.

713
00:31:47,646 --> 00:31:48,980
Well, that makes two of us.

714
00:31:49,015 --> 00:31:50,815
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

715
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:52,783
What's this about ?

716
00:31:52,818 --> 00:31:56,020
Your father's a suspect in a
series of unsolved shootings.

717
00:31:56,154 --> 00:31:57,355
What ?

718
00:31:57,389 --> 00:31:58,890
He in contact with you ?

719
00:31:58,924 --> 00:32:00,658
He ran off and left
me when I was 14.

720
00:32:00,692 --> 00:32:03,294
Had to go live with my aunt
and uncle in New Jersey.

721
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,663
- Just took off ?
- Lost everything.

722
00:32:05,697 --> 00:32:07,198
A drive-in ?

723
00:32:07,232 --> 00:32:10,401
Yeah, pretty good business
back in the '70's.

724
00:32:10,435 --> 00:32:12,536
Then they started
opening multiplexes.

725
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,772
- He try to hold on ?
- For a while.

726
00:32:14,806 --> 00:32:16,040
He loved that place.

727
00:32:16,074 --> 00:32:18,943
He used to love watching
people watch movies.

728
00:32:18,977 --> 00:32:20,945
It looks like you caught the bug.

729
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:22,679
Well, it was hard not to.

730
00:32:23,614 --> 00:32:26,384
You know, my father was
his own worst enemy.

731
00:32:26,418 --> 00:32:27,852
He should've sold the place.

732
00:32:27,886 --> 00:32:29,520
Instead, the bank took it.

733
00:32:29,554 --> 00:32:31,288
So, what did he do after
he lost the drive-in ?

734
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:34,091
He started drinking.

735
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:37,228
I still remember the day
the dad I knew was gone.

736
00:32:37,562 --> 00:32:41,564
<i>"Kid" by The Pretenders.</i>

737
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,044
How you folks doing today ?

738
00:32:53,078 --> 00:32:54,211
Going to the park.

739
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:55,913
Nice day for it. SHEPHARD: Yeah.

740
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,618
You need a little more.

741
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:06,824
Come on, you know me.

742
00:33:06,858 --> 00:33:08,126
NORRIS: Sorry.

743
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,727
Full fare required for rides.

744
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:10,861
Those are the rules.

745
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:18,869
can anyone spot me 50 cents ?

746
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,574
Come on, man.

747
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,642
Don't embarrass me
in front of my boy.

748
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:26,977
- It's okay. We can walk.
- No, it's not okay, son.

749
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:29,680
I've got my other
passengers to take care of.

750
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:31,549
I'm sorry, sir.

751
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:32,850
There's nothing I can do for you.

752
00:33:32,884 --> 00:33:34,718
You're going to throw
me off the bus ?

753
00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:36,587
I need you to step out.

754
00:33:39,324 --> 00:33:42,560
Look, you can get a free
bus pass at the shelter.

755
00:33:55,172 --> 00:33:57,074
A month later he said
he was going up north

756
00:33:57,108 --> 00:33:58,909
to look for a job at a mill.

757
00:33:58,943 --> 00:34:00,544
That the last you saw of him ?

758
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:03,848
He was never mean
or anything like that.

759
00:34:03,882 --> 00:34:05,083
Just...

760
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:06,584
broken.

761
00:34:06,818 --> 00:34:08,519
That the number six bus ?

762
00:34:08,553 --> 00:34:09,753
I think so.

763
00:34:10,587 --> 00:34:12,490
He used to take it all the time.

764
00:34:12,824 --> 00:34:16,060
Well, that driver was
shot a couple years later.

765
00:34:16,694 --> 00:34:19,196
So, back then,
you think that my father...?

766
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:20,998
We think he's still out there.

767
00:34:21,832 --> 00:34:23,102
We'll put a tap on your phones,

768
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,503
in case he tries to reach you.

769
00:34:24,536 --> 00:34:26,070
Excuse me.

770
00:34:26,104 --> 00:34:28,973
You know, I-I haven't seen or
heard from him in 30 years.

771
00:34:29,007 --> 00:34:30,641
Anyplace he might've gone to?

772
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:35,112
I-I spent half my life trying
to forget what happened.

773
00:34:37,582 --> 00:34:40,384
Traced his V.A. checks to a P. O. box
in Mount Pocono.

774
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:42,619
The clerk there's pulling
up a home address.

775
00:34:42,954 --> 00:34:44,088
Let's go.

776
00:34:45,724 --> 00:34:47,424
The guy we're looking for is Walt.

777
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:49,359
Postal clerk for 40 years.

778
00:34:49,393 --> 00:34:51,529
Bill Shephard still rents a box?

779
00:34:51,563 --> 00:34:54,498
Yeah, all rentals have
physical addresses on file.

780
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:57,835
Clerk said he just needed
to locate the records.

781
00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:00,838
A good place to hide out from
the world and plot your revenge.

782
00:35:07,044 --> 00:35:08,245
Walt ?

783
00:35:08,747 --> 00:35:10,380
FBI. We spoke on the phone.

784
00:35:10,415 --> 00:35:11,982
Pretty lady...

785
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:13,817
Get him.

786
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:16,053
I got you covered.

787
00:35:19,423 --> 00:35:21,192
Let's get him out of there.

788
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:25,596
- You got him ?
- Yeah.

789
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:29,199
We need backup now !

790
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:31,936
Hold on. Hold on !

791
00:35:38,442 --> 00:35:41,176
We got an eyewitness
saw a black Chevy van

792
00:35:41,211 --> 00:35:42,945
speeding away after the shooting.

793
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,446
What about the postal clerk ?

794
00:35:44,481 --> 00:35:45,781
Critical.

795
00:35:46,515 --> 00:35:49,351
Ugh, here come
the FBI stormtroopers.

796
00:35:56,859 --> 00:35:59,495
Hey, John, I'll keep
you out of this.

797
00:35:59,529 --> 00:36:00,662
Keep me out of what?

798
00:36:00,697 --> 00:36:02,664
I wasn't exactly cleared
to work this case.

799
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:04,334
What ?

800
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:07,002
Hey, Ryan.

801
00:36:07,036 --> 00:36:08,303
How's your mother ?

802
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:10,772
Forgot how charming
you could be, Ryan.

803
00:36:10,807 --> 00:36:14,276
And I forgot how reckless you could be,
Special Agent Yates.

804
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,578
Told her section boss she
was on her way to Philly

805
00:36:16,613 --> 00:36:18,147
to look after her sick mother.

806
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:19,548
I know, I stepped in it.

807
00:36:19,582 --> 00:36:20,916
Now, is that an apology ?

808
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,985
I'm sorry for being
right about this guy.

809
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,520
I can see that.

810
00:36:24,554 --> 00:36:27,623
Now, I'm sure the family
of the postal clerk will understand.

811
00:36:27,757 --> 00:36:29,458
John Stillman, Philly PD.

812
00:36:29,492 --> 00:36:31,493
Ryan Cavanaugh.
Special Agent in charge.

813
00:36:31,828 --> 00:36:33,795
Detective Lily Rush.

814
00:36:35,398 --> 00:36:38,367
Agent Yates had no authority
to investigate this case.

815
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:41,003
You had full knowledge
of my interest in this case.

816
00:36:41,037 --> 00:36:42,738
Over here, Yates.

817
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:47,042
You breached protocol,

818
00:36:47,077 --> 00:36:49,278
misled a major metropolitan
police department.

819
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:50,579
Do you rehearse this, Ryan?

820
00:36:50,614 --> 00:36:51,814
A man is in critical condition

821
00:36:51,848 --> 00:36:54,083
who was in the presence
of an FBI agent

822
00:36:54,117 --> 00:36:55,551
and a police detective.

823
00:36:55,585 --> 00:36:57,186
That's a page one screw up, Yates.

824
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,720
You want to hang me out
to dry ? Do it.

825
00:36:58,755 --> 00:37:01,190
But you're going to need them
if you want to catch this guy.

826
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:03,392
We've already coordinated
with the state police.

827
00:37:03,426 --> 00:37:04,893
Yeah, SWAT teams are on their way.

828
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:06,261
Philly PD can assist,

829
00:37:06,296 --> 00:37:08,964
provided everything goes
through our command.

830
00:37:08,998 --> 00:37:10,666
I need to debrief you.

831
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,667
Now.

832
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:14,670
Could've told me the truth, Diane.

833
00:37:19,576 --> 00:37:20,676
I'll liaison with the Feds--

834
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,177
make sure we don't
get pushed aside.

835
00:37:22,212 --> 00:37:23,912
We'll head to the hospital,
wait for the clerk.

836
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:25,814
Still in surgery, last I heard.

837
00:37:25,848 --> 00:37:27,049
Well, guy must have known something

838
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,584
our killer didn't want
anybody else to find.

839
00:37:28,618 --> 00:37:30,252
Well, if he pulls through,
we'll question him.

840
00:37:30,886 --> 00:37:32,120
Get him to I.D. Bill Shephard.

841
00:37:32,155 --> 00:37:33,488
What he looks like now.

842
00:37:40,129 --> 00:37:41,296
<i>At what point did you decide</i>

843
00:37:41,331 --> 00:37:43,131
<i>you could just run your
own investigation, Yates ?</i>

844
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,833
<i>That day in your office, Ryan.</i>

845
00:37:44,867 --> 00:37:46,568
<i>When you were too busy
to hear my evidence.</i>

846
00:37:46,603 --> 00:37:48,971
<i>What is it with you and this case ?</i>

847
00:37:50,372 --> 00:37:51,406
Detective.

848
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:53,208
Agent.

849
00:37:54,243 --> 00:37:55,944
Might want to use the sink.

850
00:37:56,713 --> 00:37:58,547
Got blood on your hands.

851
00:37:58,581 --> 00:37:59,481
Thanks.

852
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:13,528
- Lieutenant Stillman.
- Yeah ?

853
00:38:13,563 --> 00:38:14,930
We got a location on
the suspect's van.

854
00:38:14,964 --> 00:38:15,964
You're welcome to ride along.

855
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:17,466
Let's go.

856
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,501
Honey, you can flash all
the badges you want at me.

857
00:38:19,569 --> 00:38:21,637
CIA, NSA, FBI.

858
00:38:21,671 --> 00:38:22,938
The answer's no.

859
00:38:22,972 --> 00:38:25,207
Important to speak to him
the minute he gets out of surgery.

860
00:38:25,242 --> 00:38:27,242
Man lost a lot of blood.
He's flatlined once already.

861
00:38:27,277 --> 00:38:28,377
Have a seat,

862
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:31,246
you read a Redbook and you
wait your turn.

863
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,834
Still got that blood on
your hand, Detective.

864
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,803
Uh, I was on my way when I realized

865
00:38:54,837 --> 00:38:56,772
I have Agent Yates' cell phone.

866
00:38:57,706 --> 00:38:59,207
Must've grabbed it
in the commotion.

867
00:38:59,242 --> 00:39:02,144
Detective... do you mind ?

868
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:04,513
Sorry.

869
00:39:04,547 --> 00:39:06,048
Sure.

870
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:08,450
Thank you.

871
00:39:10,051 --> 00:39:11,351
********

872
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,555
I want to get back to the
part where you decide

873
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:15,524
to misrepresent the Bureau's
interest in this case.

874
00:39:15,558 --> 00:39:17,259
Lieutenant Stillman
and I are friends.

875
00:39:17,294 --> 00:39:18,994
I bet you are.

876
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:22,999
- Problem, Yates ?
- I got to hit the head. Oh.

877
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,233
Men's room is down that way.

878
00:39:28,938 --> 00:39:30,606
What's going on ?

879
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,841
Found this in the clerk's truck.

880
00:39:36,012 --> 00:39:37,946
I'm driving.

881
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:56,932
Are you family ?

882
00:39:57,366 --> 00:39:58,633
Niece.

883
00:39:59,502 --> 00:40:00,569
Is he going to make it ?

884
00:40:00,603 --> 00:40:03,004
Best to say good-bye now.
He's conscious, but...

885
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,639
- Walt ? Is this him ?
- What the hell ?

886
00:40:04,674 --> 00:40:05,540
Bill Shephard.

887
00:40:05,575 --> 00:40:07,175
Is this the man with the P.O. box ?

888
00:40:08,945 --> 00:40:10,679
Crash cart!

889
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,084
Come out of the vehicle,

890
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,519
with your hands up.

891
00:40:17,553 --> 00:40:18,887
We have you surrounded.

892
00:40:19,655 --> 00:40:21,723
Give this guy a wakeup call.

893
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:26,228
I got no movement.

894
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:27,763
Stand by.

895
00:40:27,797 --> 00:40:29,264
Go !

896
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,471
Clear !

897
00:40:37,006 --> 00:40:38,039
Clear.

898
00:40:38,975 --> 00:40:40,909
<i>Got no movement.</i>

899
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:43,078
<i>Negative contact.</i>

900
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:51,987
This is it.

901
00:40:52,021 --> 00:40:53,555
Can't believe we missed it.

902
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:55,290
We didn't.

903
00:40:55,324 --> 00:40:57,125
I meant the FBI.

904
00:41:06,135 --> 00:41:07,636
Clear right.

905
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,238

906
00:41:11,073 --> 00:41:13,208
Looks like he's been here.

907
00:41:23,286 --> 00:41:24,386
Here.

908
00:41:25,788 --> 00:41:27,456
25.06.

909
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,423
Got to call this in.

910
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:30,692
No. In a minute.

911
00:41:43,105 --> 00:41:45,807
It's been a long time since
anyone's been down here.

912
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:47,475
- You okay ?
- Yeah.

913
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:51,751
You smell that ?

914
00:41:56,752 --> 00:41:58,320
Another victim.

915
00:42:02,457 --> 00:42:04,493
Exit wound.

916
00:42:04,527 --> 00:42:06,561
It looks self-inflicted.

917
00:42:06,795 --> 00:42:08,230
Hand me that light.

918
00:42:15,804 --> 00:42:17,205
Anything ?

919
00:42:17,773 --> 00:42:19,508
William Shephard.

920
00:42:22,245 --> 00:42:24,079
What the hell ?

921
00:42:33,623 --> 00:42:36,458
<i>"Let's Ride Into the
Sunset Together" playing.</i>

922
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:40,928
Something the matter ?

923
00:42:41,563 --> 00:42:43,465
I need to borrow your truck.

924
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,933
I don't understand.

925
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:47,168
Uh, is there something
I can help you with ?

926
00:42:51,072 --> 00:42:53,872
