2
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:04,139
Daddy, I know you don't want me
to do this.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,930
I just want you to know,
I'm not going to let you down.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,710
Kate Butler... parents reported
her missing three years ago.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,680
Pennsylvania Military Institute.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,590
I knew the cadets hated her.

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:14,710
Rhianna ?

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,610
That's what they called Ryan
after Kate smoked him.

9
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,680
Look,it wasn't... the students
that Kate Butler had to worry about.

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,170
Cadet Gardner here
will show you to Moe.

11
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,890
He's my operations officer.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,350
Look, I'd be lying to you to say

13
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:26,651
that there wasn't resentment
among some of the cadets.

14
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,720
- Lawrence !
- Yes, Major.

15
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,670
Come on, Scotty. Pick up.

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,840

21
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,330
And what day is it ?

22
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,570
Saturday.

23
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,170
Any blurred vision, nausea ?

24
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,390
No.

25
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,290
No signs of hypothermia, but you
took a pretty good shot to the head.

26
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,590
Might have a concussion.

27
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:53,991
Going to need to run a couple of tests...
CT scan, for one...

28
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,290
- and we'll follow that up with...
- How long is that going to take ?

29
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,280
The tech will be down in a couple
of minutes to bring you upstairs...

30
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,810
if they're not too backed up.

31
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,640
Either way,you're going to need to
take it easy for a while,Detective,

32
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,760
and...

33
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,240
Hey, where you going, Lil ?

34
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,770
The doc released you already ?

35
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,750
Oh, did all the tests and
came back fine.

36
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,540
They haven't even dredged your
squad car out of Neshaminy Creek yet.

37
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,700
Did CSU find anything at the scene ?

38
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,720
Skid marks from the vehicle
that ran you off the road.

39
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,410
Will, Nick and Kat are searching
PMI's campus

40
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:25,611
for a car with body damage.

41
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,060
Lil !

42
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,520
It was Cadet Lawrence Gardner,
boss.

43
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,190
He wrote that sword hate mail,

44
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:31,691
attacked Kate Butler
in the shower.

45
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,700
- He wanted her gone.
- Whoa, slow down, Lil.

46
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,400
No, I'm fine. I'm telling you.

47
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,840
We know where Lawrence
is now ?

48
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,680
Scotty went to PMI this morning
to pick him up.

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,370
He wasn't in his room,
anywhere on campus.

50
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,450
We have broadcasts all over
the region looking for him now.

51
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,660
Got to be the same guy
that ran me off the road.

52
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,880
Now, let me drive you home.
At least get a change of clothes.

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Got everything I need in my locker.

54
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,090
Hey, guys.

55
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,310
Lil.

56
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,770
- Hey, how you doing ?
- I'm fine.

57
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,880
You'd do anything to get out of
that bucket of bolts, wouldn't you ?

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,030
What do you got ?

59
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,190
Picked up Lawrence's files
when I was up there.

60
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,430
Reason he's still a senior :
he took six months off

61
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:10,131
two weeks after Kate disappeared.

62
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,510
Mom said he had mono.

63
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,310
The oldest excuse in the book.

64
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,530
What about Keith Henderson,
black cadet who said he was on tours ?

65
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,510
Yeah,checked the tours
and confinements lists.

66
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,700
Kid was on it.

67
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:22,001
The swipe card says
he never left campus.

68
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,750
Doesn't add up.
Barracks sign-out log says

69
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:25,651
he left the dorm same time Kate did.

70
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,700
That's 'cause the log was copied.

71
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,340
Found it last night in the diner.

72
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,370
November 15, '05,
the night Kate disappeared.

73
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,210
Check this one out : November 1.

74
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,600
Names, signatures, times.
Everything's the same.

75
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,010
Same damn sign-out log.
Only the date's be changed.

76
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,640
Made it look like
Kate didn't come back.

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,110
The truth is, she never even left.

78
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,040
So, who doctored these logs ?

79
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,790
Lilly.

80
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,860
Today's not the day.

81
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,240
Only place I know where to find you.

82
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,210
You get the letter I sent ?

83
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,520
You can't fix everything
with a damned letter, Dad.

84
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,570
You at least read it ?

85
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,880
Lilly ?

86
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,670
Your turn, pook.

87
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,220
I know.

88
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,770
Lilly...

89
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:34,071
I have to go do some things.

90
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,240
It means that I...

91
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:40,941
I may have to be gone a while.

92
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,620
Where are you going ?

93
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,970
Don't know yet.

94
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,050
With Mommy ?

95
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,770
No, no, I don't... I don't think so.
Probably not.

96
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,710
Who's going to sleep by her ?

97
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:03,820
Well, sometimes mommies and daddies,
they don't sleep by each other.

98
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,900
Which way can I move
my knight ?

99
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,490
L-move,two and one.

100
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,910
But if you take my pawn,
I'll take your knight with my rook.

101
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,420
Or you could do that.

102
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,410
You really are a smart kid.

103
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,830
Lilly.

104
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,670
What's the matter ?

105
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,900
- Are you okay ?
- I got to get back.

106
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,990
Celeste.

107
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,600
My wife's name.

108
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,370
Been married 22 years.

109
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,620
We have a daughter, Maggie,
and a son, Finn.

110
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,610
They want to meet you.

111
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,310
Lil.

112
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,050
John Stillman.

113
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,170
Paul Cooper.

114
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,070
I didn't mean to interrupt.

115
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,080
You're not.

116
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,810
I got to go.

117
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,170
We found the car that
ran you off the road.

118
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,980
It's on the PMI campus.

119
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,680
Passenger-side mirror is busted.

120
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,050
Dent, front right side.

121
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,020
Paint transfer from another car.
CSU tech took a sample.

122
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,360
Looks like yours.

123
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,390
Said the treads looked good
for the skid marks at the scene.

124
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,920
Is it the car that hit you ?

125
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,150
All I saw were the headlights.

126
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,370
Glad you're okay.

127
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,870
Thanks.

128
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,020
PMI staffer said
it's a campus car.

129
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:47,221
Tow squad's on its way.

130
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,450
Belongs to the school ?

131
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,150
We just got to find out who had
access and where the keys are.

132
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,100
Time to shut this campus down.

133
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,140
Trap a rat in his hole.

134
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,460
DEFCON One in effect, Detectives.

135
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,420
Front gate is closed.Every door
with a handle or hinge,locked down.

136
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,040
Who are the campus cars for ?

137
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,160
We make them available to
administrators who may need them.

138
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,610
What about students ?

139
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,200
- Only senior aides.
- Lawrence Gardner.

140
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,080
He a senior aide ?

141
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,471
Assaulting and killing Kate Butler,
running a cop off the road.

142
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,220
Those are some serious accusations
you're making.

143
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:21,121
Suburban with the damage.

144
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,890
Was Lawrence using it ?

145
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,730
He was picking up a football
recruit at the airport yesterday.

146
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,260
Still has the keys.

147
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,680
Lawrence have access to the
barracks sign-out logs in '05 ?

148
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,530
Lawrence's always done his best
to serve the school.

149
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,770
Just answer the question.

150
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,480
He was Echo Company clerk.

151
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,330
Why did Lawrence take a six-month
leave of absence, December '05 ?

152
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,630
Wasn't mono, was it, Moe ?

153
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,790
Fatigue.

154
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,750
"Fatigue." You saying the kid
had some kind of breakdown ?

155
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,750
Looking back...

156
00:08:57,951 --> 00:08:59,651
a few days before
she disappeared,

157
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,100
it all starts to make sense.

158
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,790
Fight till you drop.

159
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,570
You go down, you die.

160
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,420
Someone will take care
of your girl. Understood ?

161
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,420
Sir, yes, sir !

162
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,280
Now, which one of you chuckleheads thinks
he can take Cadet Lawrence,

163
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:19,381
best pugil stick in Echo Company ?

164
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,000
No one wants to man up ?

165
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,210
I'd like a shot, sir.

166
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,660
Cadet Butler... you a man ?

167
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,480
No, sir. But I'd like a shot, sir.

168
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,850
Think you're special, Butler ?

169
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,550
Is that how you see yourself,
special as a snowflake ?

170
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,670
Sir, I'm no snowflake, sir.

171
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,730
Step up, Maxipad.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

172
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,970
Lawrence, take no prisoners.

173
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,580
Yes, sir.

174
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,120
Hit him, Kate...
that's right.

175
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,690
Come on ! Come on, Lawrence.

176
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,300
Don't let a girl kick your ass.

177
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,330
Come on, Lawrence...
don't let her get you.

178
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,100
Knock that bitch down !

179
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,050
Get up, Kate... come on !

180
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,440
Take her down, Lawrence.

181
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,240
Don't you ever come near me again.

182
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,841
<i>"Alive" by Pearl Jam.</i>

183
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,550
Girl was tougher than I thought.

184
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,260
Saying she was out for revenge ?

185
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,860
Didn't know about the
assault at the time.

186
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,980
Well, Lawrence didn't walk out
the front gate.

187
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,980
He's got to be holed up
somewhere on campus.

188
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,190
There's only one room in
the barracks with a lock.

189
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,580
Where's the key to Kate's room ?

190
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:53,681
........

191
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,370
Police ! Open up.

192
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,860
Get him down.

193
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,110
Forget it... he's gone.

194
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,870
Key to the room.

195
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,970
And keys to the Suburban.

196
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,130
Son of a bitch.

197
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,640
Look at the rope.

198
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,290
Standard slipknot.

199
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,590
It's on the right side.

200
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,550
How did he tie it himself ?

201
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,400
Lawrence was left-handed.

202
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,050
Knot should be on the other side.

203
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,680
Rope's up under the chin.
Like he was lifted up.

204
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
Did it himself, it would've dug
into his Adam's apple.

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,230
Marks on the back of the neck.

206
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
This kid didn't kill himself.

207
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,570
Someone did it for him.

208
00:12:27,469 --> 00:12:28,669
Face front.

209
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,770
Lilly ?

210
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,360
You all right ?

211
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,110
Number three.

212
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,900
You sure ?

213
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,510
Yes.

214
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,390
It was him.

215
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,100
Number three, John.

216
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,640
You're a brave girl, Lilly Rush.

217
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,250
Who are you ?

218
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,640
John Stillman.

219
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,970
Detective Stillman's the one
who caught the man that hurt you.

220
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,600
My mother said it was too late.

221
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,940
Long as you ask the right questions,
never too late.

222
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,730
Lil ?

223
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,400
Sure you're okay ?

224
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,930
- Tired, that's all.
- I asked around.

225
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,920
Lawrence spent his share of time
in the chapel. Religious type.

226
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,610
Explains all that biblical hate mail.

227
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,990
Hiding her nakedness
from the sight of God.

228
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,560
Going to talk to the chaplain. See if
he confided in him about anything.

229
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,330
Campus lockdown came
a little too late.

230
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,230
Coroner thinks Lawrence might've
been killed some time last night.

231
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,240
Get back to your duties.

232
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,770
All hail the commandant.

233
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,130
Detective Rush. I've just informed
Cadet Gardner's family.

234
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,930
Second homicide in four years.

235
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,620
You got a PR disaster on your hands.

236
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,040
I was told this was a suicide.

237
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,870
Lawrence was dead
before he was hung.

238
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,190
Someone must've found out
we were looking at him.

239
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,840
- This happened last night ?
- That mean something you ?

240
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,060
Hank Butler came to see me.

241
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,090
He had been drinking.

242
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,310
You son of a bitch.

243
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,460
My daughter's gone.
Kate is gone.

244
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,280
- Hank, sit down.
- You were in charge, Lou.

245
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,380
I tried talking to her,
but she was her father's daughter.

246
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,030
She kept her own counsel.

247
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,150
Talk to her about what ?

248
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,240
A racking. May have gone too far.

249
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,180
Why didn't you call me ?

250
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,690
You said no special treatment.

251
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:42,291
<i>"Man of the Hour" by Pearl Jam.</i>

252
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,540
What happened ?

253
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,290
Couple of weeks before she disappeared,
I think she may have been assaulted.

254
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,820
I want the name of every
cadre in Echo Company.

255
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,730
Now.

256
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,970
Hank and I were knobs together.
We graduated the same year.

257
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,290
And you gave him those names ?

258
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,110
He would've found out anyway.

259
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,310
Lawrence Gardner on that list ?

260
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,940
What time did he leave your office ?

261
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,280
Little after midnight.

262
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,520
I assumed he went
straight home, but now...

263
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,550
Forgot this last time you were here.

264
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,670
I heard about a guy,
lost his PMI ring at boot camp.

265
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,620
Ten year anniversary,

266
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:36,621
his wife had a replacement made
to the exact specs.

267
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,010
Cadet number inside,
and whole nine.

268
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,260
- Charlotte told you about that ?
- You used to love that school.

269
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,530
- It's hard to remember.
- How about last night ?

270
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,930
- Remember that, Hank ?
- Yeah, I do.

271
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,810
Had a date with a bottle.

272
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,510
Was a terrible date.
Just what I wanted.

273
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,390
The date go down at PMI ?

274
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,610
Sallyport guard saw your car
leaving campus at 3:00 a.m.

275
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,920
About the time Cadet
Lawrence Gardner was killed.

276
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,430
Eye for an eye, Hank ?

277
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,960
I didn't hurt anyone.

278
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,400
You find that son of a bitch
before we did ?

279
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,590
I know what I said.

280
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,050
But I saw the chapel.

281
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,340
- The chapel, Hank ?
- Yeah.

282
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,830
And I asked God's forgiveness

283
00:16:17,831 --> 00:16:20,131
for what happened
last time I was there.

<i>"Nothingman" by Pearl Jam</i>

285
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,690
Attention to orders.

286
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,290
As First Sergeant, Echo Company,
I'd like to present

287
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,170
the PMI Distinction Medal to
a fourth class cadet

288
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:32,971
who has shown outstanding merit.

289
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,840
Cadet Butler, front and center.

290
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,780
Sir.

291
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,870
Cadet Butler, you have displayed
outstanding qualities

292
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,771
in both academics
and physical training.

293
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,750
Thank you, sir.

294
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,750
Do you have anything to say ?

295
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,770
Yes, I do, sir.

296
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,550
Stand at ease.

297
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,990

we esteem too lightly.

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,820
I didn't understand why
First Sergeant Addison

300
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,921
was quoting Thomas Paine
our first day here.

301
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,570
But I do now.

302
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:18,366
We might not fighting the
american revolution like he was,

303
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,590
but we're still fighting.

304
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,430
Fighting for the strength
to keep at it,

305
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:25,531
fighting for the respect
of our company,

306
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,780
and for the pride of our families.

307
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,670
I hope to earn them all someday.

308
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,420
Echo Company, atten-hut !

309
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,420
I remember the first day
she was born.

310
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,200
Those tiny little hands,
they had such a tight grip,

311
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:56,501
like she'd never let go.

312
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,130
Three hours is long time
to spend in a chapel.

313
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,740
Sure you didn't go anywhere
else that night, Hank ?

314
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,370
I didn't go looking for those cadets.

315
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,020
I left the list that Murillo
gave me on his secretary's desk.

316
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,400
Going to be checking with her on that.

317
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,900
Was the last chance I had
to tell her how proud I was.

318
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,700
And I walked away.

319
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,080
Got the Bucks County Coroner's
report on Cadet Lawrence Gardner.

320
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,980
Cause of death, manual strangulation.

321
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,810
And no scrapings under his
nails,no bruises or cuts.

322
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,870
Kid didn't put up a fight.

323
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,100
Or it happened so fast,
he didn't have time to wake up.

324
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,230
Chaplain said Lawrence
helped out with the services.

325
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,060
He was running a spiritual retreat
the night Kate was killed.

326
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,400
Off campus the whole weekend.
So, he couldn't have killed her.

327
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,870
Well, find out who else
had access to that Suburban.

328
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,080
If Lawrence wasn't driving it,
I want to know who was.

329
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,360
CSU found something
in Kate's quarters

330
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:52,561
where Lawrence's body
was found.

331
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,320
A letter to Kate.

332
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,190
Found it rolled up inside
the metal bar in her closet.

333
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,270
"Three good reasons
we should be together.

334
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,240
one : They'll never find out.

335
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,630
" "Two: None couldove you as much as Io.

336
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,940
Three: can't live thout you."

337
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,660
- "J.F.A."
-  "J.F.A".

338
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,560
- James Addison ?
- James Frederick Addison.

339
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,730
Commandant asked him
to keep an eye on Kate.

340
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,730
Gives a whole new meaning to
"shine detail".

341
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,130
Kate decides to call it off.

342
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,820
But he won't let her go.

343
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,100
Puts her in a footlocker instead.

344
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,490
Got Romeo in the box.
You ready ?

345
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,960
Be right there.

346
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,550
Son !Congratulations !

347
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,940
Your mother and I are so proud of you.

348
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,160
Hey, Lil, you coming or what ?

349
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,160
You see my dad come by
here a few minutes ago ?

350
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,530
No. No.
Is everything all right ?

351
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,310
Yeah. Yeah.

352
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,510
Just trying to tie up
some loose ends, Lieutenant.

353
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,480
What you told us about Kate
being attacked in the showers.

354
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,790
- I told you everything I ow.
- Right, on shine detail.

355
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,580
She ever mention being romantically
involved with another cadet?

356
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,090
No. She wasn't.

357
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,510
Well, you seem pretty sure about that.

358
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,650
She wouldn't risk violating
the non-fraternization policy.

359
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,260
Would you ?

360
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,240
I don't know what you mean.

361
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,840
Found this love letter in her room.

362
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,680
It's your handwriting, Don Juan.

363
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,790
You didn't just watch out for
Cadet Butler. You took advantage of her.

364
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,920
Senior cadet is a position of power.

365
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,680
She couldn't get rid
of you if she wanted to.

366
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,150
She wasn't getting rid of me.

367
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:09,251
You knew about the assault,
that Lawrence was unstable.

368
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,940
Told us about the barracks
sign-out log,

369
00:21:10,941 --> 00:21:12,741
the list of guards with sabers.

370
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,360
You knew Lawrence would
look good for her murder.

371
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,970
You string him up, case closed,
right, we all go home ?

372
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,190
Beautiful job.

373
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,820
You just put the knot
on the wrong damn side.

374
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,550
I don't get it. I thought
Lawrence killed himself.

375
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,650
Lawrence didn't kill himself, James.
Just like Kate didn't run away.

376
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,180
Give us three good reasons we
shouldn't lock your lying ass up.

377
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,670
All right, so I liked her.

378
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,830
And when she didn't like you back ?

379
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,170
What did you do then,James?

380
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,300
I wrote her that letter.

381
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,180
She doesn't give you the
answer you're looking for.

382
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,250
Try and convince her otherwise,
she says no...

383
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,880
No ! She felt the same way.

384
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,370
I know she did.

385
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,550
<i>"Given to Fly" by Pearl Jam.</i>

386
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,940
Cadet Butler ?

387
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,060
There's a million good reasons
we should be together,James.

388
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,690
But I can't.

389
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,240
Not until after Recognition Day.

390
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,810
What's gonna change then?

391
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,130
Won't be a knob anymore.

392
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,250
They won't treat you any different,
Kate. Trust me.

393
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,510
The hell with them.I'm
not doing this for them.

394
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,790
You're doing it 'cause of your old man.

395
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,730
Growing up,

396
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,340
my dad talked about this place
like the Earth revolved around it.

397
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,200
But now, I'm doing it for me.

398
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,320
And the harder they push,
the harder I fight back.

399
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,070
That's the way you want to go about it,
it's gonna be a long four years.

400
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,650
- I won that medal legit.
- Lots of guys won medals, Kate.

401
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,530
Just 'cause you can hack it
doesn't mean they'll accept you.

402
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,970
I can't make them like me.

403
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,740
They think you're some tight-ass grinder,
a barracks rat.

404
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,620
You never go out, you never
even let them get to know you.

405
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,350
You don't think I want that ?

406
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,730
I've never been invited.

407
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,810
I'm inviting you now.

408
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,180
You said it yourself.
They hate me.

409
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,480
Well, then, let them see
the other side of you.

410
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,500
The side that I see.

411
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,170
Don't just prove to them
that you can hack it.

412
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,960
Prove to them that you belong.

413
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,890
I thought she was gonna come
out that night and meet me.

414
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,050
That maybe things could
change for Kate at the school.

415
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,320
But she never showed up ?

416
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,630
I didn't blame her.
I mean, the guys were tough.

417
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,230
But no barracks rat ever
makes it through PMI.

418
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,720
Barracks rat ?

419
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:48,621
Guys who hole up in the dorms
all weekend.

420
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,820
Too stressful a place.
You... you got to blow off some steam.

421
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,350
There's no way you can make it
through that school without friends.

422
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,960
Excuse me.

423
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,890
You all right ?

424
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,870
Freezing.
Who turned off the heat ?

425
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:11,371
Cutbacks. Dropped the thermostat.

426
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,780
Do me favor.

427
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,650
Check the sign-out logs
for all of Kate's knob year.

428
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,120
Find the barracks rats, cadets
who never left on the weekends.

429
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,260
Ma'am ?

430
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,220
You wanted to see me,
Lieutenant ?

431
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,330
I see you made the pinch
on that carjacking, Rush.

432
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,900
Yes, Lieutenant. Had a lucky day.

433
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,100
You create your luck by hard work.

434
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,900
Well, if I was paying
more attention,

435
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,101
I might have caught the guy
before he got out onto the highway.

436
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,770
You did well on the
detective's test, too.

437
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,840
Looks like you'll make it next week.

438
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,130
Thank you,sir.Figure I'll
probably end up in East.

439
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,690
I have a few guys set to
retire next couple of years.

440
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:44,080
I could use somebody with your
instincts and determination.

441
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,090
Homicide ?

442
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,740
You interested ?

443
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,860
Of course, sir.

444
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,930
Well, learn your job at East,
do it right.

445
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,710
I'll keep an eye out,
and we'll talk when the time comes.

446
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,480
I'll be ready,sir.

447
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,240
Good,because you'll be
the first female homicide detective

448
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:00,841
in the Philly Police Department.

449
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,040
You're gonna need a thick skin.

450
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,200
I can handle myself.

451
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,750
I knew that a long time ago.

452
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,640
There was a letter sitting
on my desk. You see it ?

453
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,570
Nope. But I did check out the
barrack's sign-out log from '05.

454
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,480
- All of them?
- Hup two.

455
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:41,020
There's only one cadet who never left
the barracks on a weekend

456
00:26:41,021 --> 00:26:42,621
his entire knob year.

457
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,860
Ryan Stewart.

458
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,820
Never even went home
for the holidays.

459
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,890
You should check out
his transcript.

460
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,320
Those marks-- it's a wonder they
let him stay at the school at all.

461
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,850
Rhianna had a lot of issues.

462
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,890
You know, being soft, dull and friendless
is no way to go through college.

463
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,660
Cadet Ryan Stewart, Philly PD.

464
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,820
Go away!

465
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,550
There's something blocking it.

466
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,930
Open the door, you little pissant.

467
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,630
- Just leave me alone !
- Relax, Ryan. Just want to talk.

468
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,860
No. There's nothing to talk about.
I can't take this anymore.

469
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,470
Take what anymore ?

470
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,390
What you did to Kate ?

471
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,810
Look, I'm sick of lying.

472
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,650
We can help.

473
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,300
Come on, Ryan. We can help you.

474
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,080
Nobody's gonna help me.

475
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,950
Look, I can't go to jail.
Nobody's gonna bail me out.

476
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,950
Bad shape.Bad shape.

477
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,200
Gun !

478
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,980
You come any closer, I swear
to God, I'm gonna shoot.

479
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,660
You don't have to worry about that.I'm
gonna blow your brains out for you.

480
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,000
Get your ass on the ground !

481
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,960
It was me. I did it, 

482
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:00,161
I'm sorry.

483
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,130
All right, you ready ?

484
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,640
Talk about that night.

485
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,680
It was just me in the barracks.

486
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,880
That Saturday night ?
November 15, 2005 ?

487
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,890
Every Saturday night.

488
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,010
You know, it was just me.

489
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,560
Kate was there, too ?

490
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,000
The only other cadet around.

491
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,000
And even with all the crap
that she took, she was a girl.

492
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,240
And they still liked her
better than me.

493
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,220
<i>"Release" by Pearl Jam.</i>

494
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,770
Ryan ? What are you doing here ?

495
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,690
Oh,it's... it's calculus.

496
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,980
This new chapter is killing me.

497
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,780
I heard you are a good tutor, so...

498
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:52,981
I haven't even looked at it yet.

499
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,240
Oh,I just figured you'd probably
be holed up studying, too, so...

500
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,170
You're not going out ?

501
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,670
No.

502
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,780
What's new ? I guess we
have that in common, huh ?

503
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,170
Why don't you take my notes ?

504
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,650
Okay, cool.

505
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,990
So, what are you...?

506
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,910
What's up ? Are you just...?
Are you just going to bed ?

507
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,660
Look, Ryan, I got to get ready.

508
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,440
Where you going ?

509
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,710
Meeting some of the guys.

510
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,130
You're kidding.

511
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,540
Who ?

512
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,660
Echo Company ?

513
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,020
They-They invited you out?

514
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,620
- You should come, too.
- No.

515
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,900
I get it. They'd... they'd ther
just hang out with a chick than me.

516
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,180
- Come on, Ryan.
- Oh, no, no.

517
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,770
Oh, you mean, Rhianna, right ?

518
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,080
Worthless tub of goo ?

519
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,340
Don't say that. You got to show
them you can hang with them.

520
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,030
No. You probably just think
that I'll wash out anyway, right ?

521
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,920
Is that what... ?
That's what you think, right ?

522
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,100
No. I didn't say that.

523
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,790
No. You think that. Right ?

524
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,800
They all think it.

525
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,900
You-you know that the guys
above us...

526
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,600
they all say that they're the last
true class of PMI because of you.

527
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,060
- Not 'cause of me.
- You have ruined everything.

528
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,690
Graduating from here
used to mean something.

529
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,130
- Ryan, just take the notes.
- No, I don't want the notes.

530
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,930
Damn it, Ryan.

531
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,120
And I just kept waiting
for her to stand up...

532
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,710
...but she didn't.

533
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,810
How did you get rid of the body ?

534
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,500
What ?

535
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,350
You were a freshman.
You didn't have a car.

536
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,220
So how did you get rid
of the body ?

537
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,600
Somebody helped him.

538
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,440
Lawrence ?

539
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,740
Kid doesn't have it in him to
pull off a premeditated murder.

540
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,000
And why confess to one murder,
but not two ?

541
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,920
The Suburban from PMI
that hit you

542
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:25,921
was ticketed five times
in the past four years.

543
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,100
95 South, 76 West
and Ridge Avenue.

544
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,110
On the way to Roxborough.

545
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,880
Same driver used the car every time.

546
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,510
Army.

547
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:40,450
Rangers, right ?Got to be a tough
son of a bitch to wear that beret.

548
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,650
Came back to PMI in
'87 as a PT instructor.

549
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,700
You're an institution.

550
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,210
Part of the long blue line.

551
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,350
Fourth generation... sir.

552
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,060
Been looking over Ryan
Stewart's transcript.

553
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,750
Uh, academic...  probation twice.

554
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,480
Poor to failing marks in...

555
00:32:06,781 --> 00:32:07,781
...PT.

556
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,250
Ma'am ?

557
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,980
The kid was a non-hacker.

558
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,450
Hardly PMI material.

559
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,730
Hindsight is always 20/20.

560
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,070
Yeah, but you promoted
that chucklehead.

561
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,310
Got your sigture on his evaluations.

562
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,220
"Cadet Stewart shows promise."

563
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,120
You saying I gave him a pass,
Detective ?

564
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,930
That what it sounds like to you ?

565
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,950
Took another look at
those campus car records.

566
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:36,530
Every Sunday morning, it was you
who checked out one of those cars.

567
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,410
I take my mother to mass
on Sundays.

568
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,030
A diligent son.

569
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,790
Well,it turns out you're
a creature of habit.

570
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,080
You got three speeding tickets,
two on the 76,

571
00:32:44,081 --> 00:32:45,481
and another on Ridge Avenue.

572
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,740
Same car.

573
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,050
I like to be on time.

574
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,490
See,Ridge Ave off 76 goes
right through Roxborough.

575
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,230
And the cemetery where Kate
Butler's body was buried.

576
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,370
Now you're saying I had
something to do

577
00:32:56,371 --> 00:32:57,971
with Cadet Butler's murder ?

578
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,580
Told you,
Lawrence drove that car.

579
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,820
Lawrence was just the
clerk who knew too much.

580
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,900
Knew about the doctored
sign-out logs from the barracks.

581
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,590
Lawrence Gardner was unstable.

582
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,490
What you wanted us to think when you
stuffed the car keys in his pocket.

583
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,510
Teach you that in
hand-to-hand combat training,

584
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:13,411
how to kill a man in his sleep,
string him up ?

585
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,200
Pretty fanciful.

586
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,770
Yeah.

587
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,830
Same way you panicked when
my partner got too close.

588
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,230
Ran her off the road
in that same car.

589
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,370
What happened between
Cadets Stewart and Butler

590
00:33:29,371 --> 00:33:31,371
was tragic and shameful,

591
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,420
but if you're looking
to spread the blame,

592
00:33:33,421 --> 00:33:35,221
I suggest you start
with the courts.

593
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,520
The courts...

594
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,650
killed Kate Butler ?

595
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,300
Do you know how many congressmen
have graduated from PMI ?

596
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,660
Twelve. Six senators,
eight four-star generals.

597
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:50,930
Those courts ordered us to
change the way we do things here.

598
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,570
Now here we are.

599
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,940
Stuck installing women's
latrines and tampon dispensers.

600
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:00,270
There are over 60 women's
colleges in this country.

601
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,290
Do you see any men banging
down the doors trying to get in ?

602
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,950
The value of a separate
education

603
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:08,851
is that it is separate !

604
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,050
Sound bitter, Moe.

605
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,400
Because of this catastrophic
experiment,

606
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:16,201
an army of lawyers and press

607
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,710
stand ready to shut down
the institution I love,

608
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:24,730
the one thing I share with
my father and his before him.

609
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:30,420
Excuse me if I forgot to shed a
tear for Hank Butler's daughter.

610
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,640
That why you buried her ?

611
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,190
Think I'll take one
of those lawyers now.

612
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,040
Long night ?

613
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,350
Can't piece it together.

614
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,530
The story.

615
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,770
What you always told me.

616
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,720
Ask the right questions
till the story makes sense.

617
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,410
So what's the right question ?

618
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,070
You remember the honor code,
Ryan ?

619
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,540
"A cadet shall not lie, cheat, or steal,
nor tolerate those who do."

620
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,760
- He.
- What ?

621
00:35:42,761 --> 00:35:44,661
"Nor shall
he tolerate those who do."

622
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,620
That's right, by and for men,

623
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:51,021
the way it's always been,
the way Moe wants it to stay.

624
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,720
See, Moe believed in me.

625
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,580
Still worried he'll think less of you ?

626
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,390
That you're not a man if
you don't take the rap ?

627
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,120
Not PMI material ?

628
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,290
The school has a tradition.

629
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,550
It has a code.

630
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,710
That's what he'd have you believe.

631
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:10,160
But if the honor code
is the backbone of PMI...

632
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,050
why did he ask you to lie ?

633
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,290
Lawrence Gardner didn't
kill himself, did he ?

634
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,240
No,he didn't,Ryan.

635
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,790
I went to tell him what I did wrong.

636
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,600
I didn't know what else to do.

637
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,580
<i>"Immortality" by Pearl Jam.</i>

638
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,690
You'd better have
a hell of a good reason

639
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:38,391
for bothering me
on a Saturday night,boy.

640
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,550
I hurt her, sir.

641
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,510
Get in here.

642
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,740
Get a hold of yourself, cadet.
Who did you hurt ?

643
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,510
Cadet Butler,sir.

644
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,200
I hit her and she didn't get up.

645
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,290
Where is she ?

646
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,930
In her room.
She's not breathing, sir.

647
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,110
What do you mean
she's not breathing ?

648
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,470
I didn't mean it,sir.

649
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,730
Who else knows ?

650
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,700
Came straight to you, sir.

651
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,460
You want to graduate from
this institution, don't you, son ?

652
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,870
More than anything, sir.

653
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,440
Be a PMI man just like
your father ?

654
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,450
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Good.

655
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,200
Go get a footlocker out of storage.

656
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,870
This did not happen,
not on this campus.

657
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,150
Do you understand me, son ?!

658
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,230
Loud and clear, sir.

659
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,460
As you were.

660
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,860
Sir, yes, sir.

661
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,420
Got you,Moe.

662
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,810
That so ?

663
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,550
You sent Ryan for that footlocker,

664
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:08,951
made Cadet Butler's body disappear,
and you framed Lawrence for the job.

665
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,800
What,now you going to tell
me that kid is really dead?

666
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:20,370
I just... I just know he didn't do it.

667
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,580
That's all that matters.

668
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,820
Stories.

669
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:29,630
You're just telling yourself stories.

670
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,990
Even tried to take out a cop.

671
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,710
You ?

672
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:38,611
Busier than a one-legged man
in an ass-kicking competition, Moe.

673
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,750
You can only keep the flood
back for so long, Detective.

674
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:49,050
The flood ?

675
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,310
Pretty soon it's going
to pull you down...

676
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:54,111
for good.

677
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,780
You put that girl in a box !

678
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,840
I put you there, too, sweetheart.

679
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,850
No. No, I got out.

680
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,970
I got you !

681
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,780
Not from where I'm sitting.

682
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,410
What the hell is going on ?!

683
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,770
<i>Long as you ask the right
questions, never too late.</i>

684
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,080
It's okay, Lil.
It's going to be okay.

685
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,710
We're going to get this guy,
all right, we'll get him.

686
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,050
EMT said she kept going on
about the barracks sign-out log.

687
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,280
Just located the car
that ran her off the road.

688
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,520
On campus.

689
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:55,150
<i>Dear Lilly, there are two sides
to every story,</i>

690
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:59,451
<i>neither of which I think
you'll find satisfactory.</i>

691
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,940
<i>Suffice it to say, there is no way I could
have stayed with your mother and survived.</i>

692
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,710
<i>In that sense,
you're already stronger than me.</i>

693
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,790
<i>"Black" by Pearl Jam.</i>

694
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,770
<i>I was a lousy father.</i>

695
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,520
<i>When I got sober enough to
figure out how much I missed,</i>

696
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,310
<i>it was too late

<i>Much to my regret,</i>

699
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,790
<i>I'll always be the dad
who bought you a bike,</i>

700
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,300
<i>but never taught you
how to ride it.</i>

701
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:40,530
* Spread out before me
As her body once did *

702
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,650
<i>There were a few moments</i>

703
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,480
<i>I tried to reconnect along the way.</i>

704
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:54,050
<i>But you were on your own
path by then, your own woman.</i>

705
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,410
<i>And you turned out great, kid.</i>

{\a6}* Now the air I tasted and
breathed Has taken a turn Ooh,*

708
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:17,770
* and all I Taught her was Everything...*

709
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,460
<i>I've missed so much of your life.</i>

710
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,200
<i>For that, I am sorry.</i>

711
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,400
<i>Not only to you,</i>

712
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:29,401
<i>but for depriving myself for
all those times you needed a father,</i>

713
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,620
<i>somebody to protect you.</i>

714
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:38,700
* And now my bitter hands
Cradle broken glass *

715
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,610
<i>When you showed up that day at
the park all these years later,</i>

716
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,890
<i>my heart about jumped out
of my chest.</i>

717
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,750
<i>I thought maybe you came
to judge me</i>

718
00:42:46,751 --> 00:42:47,951
<i>till I realized</i>

719
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:51,010
<i>I'm the only parent you got left.</i>

720
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,610
<i>Like it or not,
you only get one father.</i>

721
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:58,380
* Gone bad Turned my world
to black *

722
00:42:58,381 --> 00:43:01,481
* Tattooed all I see *

723
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:08,190
* All that I am All I'll be...*

724
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,150
<i>Just know, if there's ever another moment
in your life when you need me,</i>

725
00:43:21,451 --> 00:43:23,751
<i>I'll be there.</i>
