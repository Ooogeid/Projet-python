1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,800
"Our lives begin to end

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,600
the day we become silent
about things that matter."

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,100
These words of
Martin Luther King Jr.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,100
hold special import today,
as our own lives begin;

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,200
as we go forth,
past these ivory towers,

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,900
into a city and a world
rife with poverty, with war,

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,700
and with injustice.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,600
Be brave, be fearless...

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,800
...and most importantly,
be compassionate.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,300
Congratulations,
Class of 1982...

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,800
...we are officially graduated.

12
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,600
Ms. Rush... Lily...
Ms. Rush... Lily...

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,300
Lily, Lily...

14
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,200
We're losing her.

15
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,900
Another late night?

16
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,800
Too many margarita

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,500
Gin kills me.

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,100
Gin? You mean tequila.

19
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,700
I don't make 'em,
I just drink 'em.

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
Trouble sleeping, huh?

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,100
No, not at all.

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,100
You're here early.

23
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,800
Anything to get
out of PPD.

24
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,200
Jeffries biting
everyone's head off?

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,900
I won't even step foot
into Stillman's office.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600
When's the boss back?

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,700
Two more weeks.
Counting the days.

28
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,100
And minutes.
So, what's up?

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,000
Kid buried here--
a Mike Delaney.

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,900
College type,
shot back in '82.

31
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,800
Someone vandalized
his grave.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,100
The 25th anniversary
of his death coming up.

33
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,400
University's doing some kind
of memorial service for him?

34
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,400
Big man on campus,
back in the day.

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,100
College police, homicide-- both
turned the place inside out.

36
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,800
Got nothing--
no suspects, no motives.

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,200
Hmm-- straight-A student,
varsity jock...

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
president of the local
"Meals On Wheels" chapter...

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Making the rest of us look like lazy-ass
good-for-nothings.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,900
Had a reputation
as a womanizer.

41
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,600
A real Casanova.

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,400
Every girl on
campus wanted him,

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,100
every guy wanted
to be him.

44
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,900
But who'd want
to kill him?

45
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,500
Maybe her.

49
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,700
original theory ???

50
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,300
University's in the middle of
one of Philly's poorest hoods.

51
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,800
Lots of tension between
the students and the locals.

52
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,300
Well, no one heard
the altercation, gunfire.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
???   Graduation night,
everyone's loaded.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,800
Security guard found Mike's
body the next morning,

55
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,200
middle of the quad.

56
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,900
There was a
nine-millimeter

57
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,200
recovered three blocks
from the crime scene...

58
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
matched our victim's ballistics.

59
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,900
No prints.

60
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,000
The serial number was filled
off, making it untraceable.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,600
No National Ballistics
Database back then.

62
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,300
Might be able to
sniff it out now.

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,700
Let's run it.

64
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,600
Sure, Boss.

65
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,600
We're also looking into the
cemetery surveillance footage

66
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,500
from this morning-- maybe
our tagger got caught on tape.

67
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,700
The trajectory of the bullet
indicates the doer

68
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,400
was anywhere from five-two
to five-four.

69
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,800
Well, if the doer's a
vigilante rape victim,

70
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,600
height could
point to a woman.

71
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,200
Might've found our tagger.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,500
Police report filed back in '82
at West Detectives.

73
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,600
Alleged rape naming
Michael Delaney as the doer.

74
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,300
- Who's the victim?
- Name's left blank.

75
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,700
The assigned officer
was a Maggie Lafferty.

76
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,000
"Locked and Loaded"
Lafferty.

77
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,700
Instructor at the
Academy range.

78
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,600
Was a real ball-buster.

79
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Want us to have a talk?

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,700
Do you really need me
to tell you what to do?

81
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,900
Just checking... Boss.

82
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,800
Don't call me Boss.

83
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,400
I'm out of here at 5:00 today,
so no dilly-dallying.

84
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,300
You a 5:00 p.m. man now?
That Toni's doing?

85
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Ah, figured I'd set a good
example for Andre.

86
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,000
Sit-down family dinners.

87
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,700
What?

88
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,100
Know what I'm getting you
for Christmas--

89
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,200
tickets to the ballet.

90
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,100
Ballet?!

91
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,900
Yep. <i>The Nutcracker.</i>

92
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,600
Is that the pit bull?

93
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,400
Maggie Lafferty?

94
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,400
Philly P.D.

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,800
Would've never guessed,
cheap suit and all.

96
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,300
You worked Sex Crimes at West
in '82, right, Maggie?

97
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,900
On the line, too.
So what?

98
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,300
You handle this job?

99
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,900
I remember the kid, sure.

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,400
Said a Michael Delaney
raped her?

101
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,400
Yep.

102
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,500
Nothing I could do.

103
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,900
I thought you were
Sex Crimes.

104
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,400
A joke, back in the day.

105
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,300
I had a desk, a phone,
that's it.

106
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,600
Nobody cared.

107
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,900
Not that you'd remember.

108
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,100
You, maybe.

109
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,400
So you sent her away.
Nice.

110
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,800
My lieutenant said
rape victims

111
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
were gals that just regretted it
the next morning.

112
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,600
My hands were tied.

113
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,800
Real door prize,
your lieutenant.

114
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,600
Men-- can't live with 'em,
can't kill 'em off.

115
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,900
Drop the battle axe.
Talk about the girl.

116
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,300
Name was, uh... Tess...
Tessie something or other.

117
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,500
Scholarship kid from Kensington,

118
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,400
working a job in
the school cafeteria,

119
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,300
raising her kid brother,
parents dead.

120
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,400
How'd she run into Delaney?

121
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,200
Knew the ass-clown from school.

122
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,700
Real charmer, that guy.

123
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,500
Gave her a paper rose
before he tore her up.

124
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,800
So this Tessie comes in...

125
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,300
And boy, was she a wreck.

126
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,500
Don't you think it'd be wise
to leave your kid brother home?

127
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,600
I told Jimmy I got robbed,
that's why we're here.

128
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
He's scared to stay home alone.

129
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,400
So you, uh,
knew your attacker?

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,600
We went out
two nights ago.

131
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,100
So you dated this guy?

132
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,300
We didn't date.

133
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,900
We went out. Once.

134
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,200
And, uh, where'd
the rape occur?

135
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,800
In... in my apartment.

136
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,400
He dropped me off
after dinner;

137
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,600
he said
he had to use the bathroom,

138
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,400
Any witnesses
to what transpired?

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,200
My brother was asleep
in the next room.

140
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,700
Maybe I should've screamed,
woke him up,

141
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,500
so he could've witnessed it.

142
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Look, you want to press charges,
I can do that.

143
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,800
But this is how
it's gonna play out.

144
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,800
How much did you
have to drink?

145
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,100
What were you wearing?

146
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Why'd you
bring him home?

147
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,500
I already told you.

148
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,900
Do you bring guys up
to your place a lot?

149
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,500
Are you sexually
promiscuous?

150
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,500
Get the picture?

151
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
And after that,
he'll still walk.

152
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,100
I've seen it time and again.

153
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,000
What if he comes back?

154
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,500
What am I supposed to do?

155
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,900
If he breaks in,
you can report it.

156
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,900
Otherwise, lock your doors.

157
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,100
Right.

158
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm sorry; I really am.

159
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,300
Just give me a second.

160
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,400
When he was done,
you know what he said?

161
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,300
"You're prettier
when you smile."

162
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,500
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,200
Yeah... me, too.

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,500
Didn't even have a name
for date rape back then.

165
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,600
Rape shield laws are
supposed to protect victims

166
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,100
from being crucified
on the stand.

167
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,200
Game was different if
you knew your attacker.

168
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
No one saw 'em
as real victims.

169
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,100
So Mike rapes this girl,

170
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,300
gets off scot-free.

171
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
That's justice.

172
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,500
That was the law.

173
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,400
Tessie Bartram.

174
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,000
Philly Homicide.

175
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Homicide?!

176
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,700
Where were you
this morning?

177
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,000
Here. Home.

178
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Getting ready for work.
Why?

179
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,000
Got anyone
to verify that?

180
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,800
No. I live alone.

181
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,100
What is this about?

182
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,600
Does the name
Mike Delaney

183
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,900
ring any bells?

184
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Of course.

185
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,500
He went to my school.

186
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,300
The grave was vandalized
this morning.

187
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,000
- Know anything about that?
- Absolutely not.

188
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,900
Well, we know
what he did to you.

189
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,200
Look, I'm late
for an appointment.

190
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,000
No one believed you, so you
pretended it never happened.

191
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,900
But it did.

192
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,500
I don't know what
you're talking about.

193
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,000
I think you do.

194
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
- What do you want from me?
- The truth.

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,200
25 years later-- you're kind of
late to the party.

196
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,400
Understandable,
you wanting revenge.

197
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,500
So, in other words,
did I kill that bastard?

198
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,100
Did you?

199
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,500
Graduation day I was home
with my brother, so, no.

200
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,000
You didn't go
to your own graduation?

201
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,700
I dropped out
after it happened

202
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,200
and I never set foot
on that damn campus again.

203
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,100
You grew up in Kensington.

204
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,900
Must've felt lucky
to be at that school.

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,900
I felt even luckier when
"the" Mike Delaney liked me.

206
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,200
Hey!

207
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Hi.

208
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,300
Here's the deal:

209
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,700
I'm just gonna say it, so don't
think I'm a dope or whatever.

210
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay...

211
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,700
Every night, I see
you sitting here,

212
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
not messing around
like the rest of us,

213
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
or killing time
till the bars open,

214
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,300
and I'm thinking this
girl's different.

215
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,500
- Special.
- Yeah, right.

216
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,300
Just hear me out, okay?

217
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,800
Because every night, I'm like:
"Go over there right now,

218
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,200
say the perfect thing..."

219
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,100
But I know
whatever it is,

220
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,200
she'll just think it's some
dumb pick-up in a library.

221
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,500
Not yet, I don't.

222
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,000
You think
I should give it a shot?

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Go for it.

224
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,300
I'm gonna do it then.

225
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,200
Okay? You ready?
Here it comes.

226
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,600
Would you have dinner with me?

227
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,300
I bought his crap,
hook, line and sinker.

228
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,100
You were young, he was good.

229
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,000
I had nightmares about it
for months afterward.

230
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,300
I would wake up terrified

231
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,400
thinking he was
in my room.

232
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,400
Thought I was
going crazy.

233
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,700
Must have been awful.

234
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,300
And that's why
you dropped out?

235
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,100
I got a job

236
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,200
and I put my brother
through college.

237
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,700
At least one
of us graduated.

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,400
If that's it, can I go?

239
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,400
Yeah.

240
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,100
If you find who killed him...

241
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
give 'em a medal.

242
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,900
Guys like Delaney make it hell
for the rest of us.

243
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,800
Your point?

244
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,000
My point is, sometimes women say
no when they don't mean it

245
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,400
'cause if they didn't,
they'd be thought of, you know...

246
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,200
Hos?

247
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,900
Digging that ditch deeper.

248
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,900
I would never call a woman
a ho.

249
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,700
All I'm saying is
what's a guy to do,

250
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,500
back off at
the first no?

251
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,900
Human race would go extinct.

252
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,200
No means no.

253
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,300
How many ways you need that
spelled out?

254
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,600
The name of the game
is pursuit.

255
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,400
You run, I chase.

256
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,200
You ain't chasing me
anywhere.

257
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,600
We follow up
on Tess' alibi or what?

258
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,800
It checked out.
Doesn't mean the brother isn't lying.

259
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,500
'Cause "no" means "yes."

260
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,000
Enough, both of you.

261
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,000
I think I found
something--

262
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,500
Mike's yearbook.

263
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Mike gave Tessie a rose
when they met, we know that.

264
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,800
There are more roses,
more girls.

265
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,500
There must be
ten women there.

266
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,400
Could be other victims or maybe
women he was zeroing in on.

267
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,300
Saying we got a serial rapist?

268
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,900
Saying we got a new pool
of targets.

269
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,500
And any one of them could
have killed him.

270
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Are these the other women
from Mike's yearbook?

271
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,900
Yeah. Picked 'em all up
at the library.

272
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,100
Same BS
with the paper rose.

273
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,200
One of the girls we couldn't
bring in-- Shaina McNulty.

274
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,300
She lawyer up?

275
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,400
Nah, she put
a bullet in her head

276
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,200
a few months
before Mike was killed.

277
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,300
She was 18.

278
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,000
Rush and Miller
are doing the interviews.

279
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,900
Figured female cops
should talk to them.

280
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,500
Meanwhile,
us jerk male cops

281
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,000
got the security footage
from the cemetery.

282
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,800
Only visitor yesterday
morning, only one

283
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,400
who could have vandalized
Mike's grave.

284
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,900
Can't make heads
or tails.

285
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,400
I'll show it
to the groundskeeper.

286
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,000
The girls' yearbook
photos, too.

287
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,700
Might jog his memory.

288
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,700
So why do we even
care about this job?

289
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,500
The guy got what
was coming

290
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
to him, in my book--
community service murder.

291
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,000
Damn right.

292
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,100
'Cause we're murder cops.

293
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,800
Go do your jobs.

294
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,100
Mike didn't rape me.
That's ridiculous.

295
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,900
You dated him, though.

296
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,300
Once.
We had nothing in common.

297
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,800
We went our separate ways.

298
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,900
End of story.

299
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,400
Did you have sex with him?

300
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,400
That's really none
of your business.

301
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,200
Did you say no?

302
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,500
Well, that's what you're
supposed to say, right?

303
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,300
Can't be too easy.

304
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,300
Is that what you think,
you were easy?

305
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,900
I'd had too much to drink.

306
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,200
So it's your fault what he did?

307
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,300
Maybe it was.

308
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Maybe I shouldn't have
brought him up to my room.

309
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,300
I think I had too much wine.

310
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,400
Me, too.

311
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,700
Um, I'm still
a virgin, Mike.

312
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,800
Me, too.

313
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,900
Seriously, I,
I don't want to.

314
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,800
What are you doing?!
What'd you think was gonna happen?!

315
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,200
No... no... Please don't! No!
Please...!

316
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,400
I was sending
mixed signals, I guess.

317
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,200
No, you were
pretty damn clear.

318
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,100
What does it matter now?

319
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,100
Did you kill him, Melinda?

320
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,200
I wasn't raped, okay?

321
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,100
I wasn't some victim.

322
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,200
In college,
I was on top of the world.

323
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,000
Head of my sorority, dating
24-7, big-time party girl.

324
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,600
And then you met Mike.

325
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,400
After two dates, I was planning
our wedding in my head.

326
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,100
Pathetic, huh?

327
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
You liked him.

328
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,100
He said I was different,
special.

329
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,400
Right.

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,300
You ever tell anyone
what he did?

331
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,800
The morning after it happened,
I tried to tell my best friend.

332
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,500
Oh, my God.

333
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,000
You guys totally did it.

334
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,600
I don't want
to talk about it.

335
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,700
Tore this off you.

336
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,000
Mike's a total animal.

337
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,400
Give it back, Lisa.
Come on!

338
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,700
What's wrong, Kar?

339
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,400
He raped me.

340
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,200
What?

341
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,600
We were kissing,
and then... he changed.

342
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,300
Come on, Kar.

343
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,200
A guy like Mike doesn't need
to rape anyone.

344
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,700
I mean,

345
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,200
you wanted to do it
with him, right?

346
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,900
Yeah... right.

347
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,800
Let's just hope he calls.

348
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
I just always wondered
why he did it.

349
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,100
I liked him, you know?

350
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,200
He didn't have to force me.

351
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,000
Where were you
the night he was shot?

352
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,100
Oh, please, I didn't kill him.

353
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,300
I didn't even
press charges.

354
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,100
- Why not?
- I was the party girl, okay?

355
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,300
I knew what everybody
would say.

356
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,900
I didn't want to be raped
all over again.

357
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,500
A lot of anger keeping
your secret bottled up.

358
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,500
Anger?

359
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,900
You wouldn't know
the half of it.

360
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,200
A guy like Mike deserved
what he got.

361
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,800
Damn right he did.

362
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,300
Maybe you got even.

363
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,100
I wanted to, believe me.

364
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
Saw him on campus

365
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,600
everywhere weeks after.

366
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Always with that damn smile.

367
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,000
Hey, pretty lady.

368
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,900
Screw you.
Get away from me.

369
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,600
I know.
You're mad I haven't called.

370
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,700
You son of a bitch.

371
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,800
You know damn well what
happened! I said no!

372
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,900
But you didn't mean it...
did you?

373
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,300
Hey!

374
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,200
I told the dean
and he promised to look into it.

375
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,300
Next thing you know,

376
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,100
Mike's giving
a valedictorian speech.

377
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,300
Hmm. And you knew
he'd never pay.

378
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,600
The 25th anniversary
of his death-- boo-hoo.

379
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,700
You were the one who wrote
"rapist" on his grave,

380
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,100
weren't you, Regie?

381
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,200
I got pregnant after.

382
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,400
I took care of it on my own.

383
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,400
Never told a soul.

384
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,200
So, yeah, I did.

385
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,600
Fine me.

386
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,400
The world had to know
what he did to you...

387
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,900
to the others.

388
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,200
Others?

389
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,000
How many were there?

390
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,100
Did you kill him, Regie?

391
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,500
No, but I'm glad
somebody stopped him...

392
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,900
since you people never did.

393
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Can I come in?

394
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,200
What the hell
you want?

395
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
The rape victim who offed herself,
Shaina McNulty?

396
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,500
Found something.
Turns out she used

397
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,200
her dad's nine-mill
to do the deed.

398
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,000
Same make and model
that killed Mike.

399
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,700
So maybe dad found out
about the rape?

400
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,800
Figured that's why his little
girl killed herself.

401
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,400
Went looking for justice.

402
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
Dirty Harry style.

403
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,500
You owned a nine-millimeter
Smith & Wesson

404
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,600
back in '82, Mr. McNulty.

405
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,000
Same kind of gun that
killed Mike Delaney.

406
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,200
And my little girl.

407
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,000
Can't blame you

408
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,300
for offing that bastard.
I would have, too.

409
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,200
No way he's getting away
with it.

410
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,100
I didn't believe her.

411
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,100
Shaina told you what happened
with Mike?

412
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
And I told her that nice girls

413
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
don't bring boys
up to their rooms.

414
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,900
That's... what I said.

415
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,500
Hard knowing
the right thing to say.

416
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,000
Shaina shut down
right before my eyes.

417
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,700
Stopped eating,
holed up in that

418
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,000
damn dorm room.

419
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,400
I thought it was a phase.

420
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,700
She'd grow out of it.

421
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,700
Then I got the call.

422
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,200
Where is Shaina?

423
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Shaina!

424
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,100
Mr. McNulty, sir,
you can't go in there.

425
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,600
Where is she?!

426
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,600
Why didn't anyone try
and stop her?

427
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,800
Why didn't you help
my little girl?

428
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm sorry.

429
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,300
I'm so sorry.

430
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,800
If I had just believed her

431
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,500
maybe Shaina would
still be here.

432
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,700
Mr. McNulty, you sure you saw that female cop
in her dorm room?

433
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,100
I never forgot her face.

434
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,500
Like she'd seen a ghost.

435
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
She had a book,
one of Shaina's.

436
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,400
Her diary.

437
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,800
Can we take a look at it?

438
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,300
I think they kept it,
the cops.

439
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,800
Had to pack up her
room and her stuff.

440
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,700
They didn't even
clean up the blood.

441
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,400
We'll give you a minute,
Mr. McNulty.

442
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,600
Didn't stop Mike when
she had the chance.

443
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,500
So maybe she takes
the law into her own hands.

444
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,000
Don't call her Locked 'n
Loaded Lafferty for nothing.

445
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,400
???

446
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,400
Turns out it matched
a nine mil

447
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,900
used in an '81 North
Philly robbery.

448
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,800
Same year you were
working Evidence.

449
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,000
Gun disappeared
shortly after.

450
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,400
You gotta be kidding.

451
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,500
Yeah.

452
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,900
We're a barrel
of laughs here.

453
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,500
Save the smartass remarks
for the civilians.

454
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,500
'Cause you're a cop.
Right side of the law.

455
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,700
You want to take
me in, girlfriend,

456
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,600
go for it--
I'm calling my F.O.P. lawyer.

457
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,100
So you found Shaina
McNulty's diary.

458
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,900
Realized Mike
raped her, too.

459
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,000
Your fault, that kid

460
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,800
eating her gun-- you
could have stopped him.

461
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,300
I went to the DA, right?

462
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,700
Told him I had two vics and
a serial rapist on my hands.

463
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,700
He said I had no witnesses,
no evidence, no case.

464
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,100
So you took care of business.
Your own way.

465
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,800
Our job is to protect
the victims.

466
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,700
Sometimes you gotta bend
the rules.

467
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,300
More than bend
the rules.

468
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,300
You went off the
reservation, Lafferty.

469
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,600
Damn right I did.

470
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,000
Nothing was gonna stop that guy

471
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,600
except a Smith and Wesson.

472
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
So you tracked him down.
Took him out.

473
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
No.

474
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,300
But I did what I had to do.

475
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,000
<i>So I was thinking</i>

476
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,600
we'd treat ourselves
to a flick tonight.

477
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,800
We got movie
money, Tessie?

478
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,500
Hey, don't worry about it, okay?

479
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,300
You're 12, geez,
think about girls or something.

480
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,900
Tessie?

481
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,500
That, uh, robbery...

482
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,300
think we might have
found your wallet.

483
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,800
Put the ice cream away, Jimmy,
before it melts.

484
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
I'll wait
for you, Tess.

485
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,100
Go up, already.

486
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,800
I'll be there
in a minute, okay?

487
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,900
Okay.

488
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,200
Been, uh, thinking
about what you said.

489
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,700
Him coming back.

490
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,400
Got the right
to defend yourself.

491
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,900
Yeah, I remember.
Lock my doors.

492
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,100
Other ways to do it.

493
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,400
Know what I mean?

494
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,100
He comes at you, it's
called imminent danger.

495
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,100
The DA'll never
charge you.

496
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,700
You're telling me...

497
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,300
to kill him.

498
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,000
That would be, uh,
unethical of me as a cop.

499
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,100
Just informing you of
your rights is all.

500
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,800
Mail's piling up.

501
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,000
Might want to
check your box.

502
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,600
You gave her the gun
that killed Mike Delaney.

503
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,700
Get off the high
and mighty, will you?

504
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,600
System wasn't gonna protect
victims like her, I had to.

505
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,500
By telling her how
to commit a felony.

506
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,400
'82 was a long, long time ago.

507
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,700
My memory's
kind of fuzzy.

508
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,600
Well, we'll subpoena you.
Put you on the stand.

509
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,500
You try to take
that kid down,

510
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,500
you'll get nothing from me.

511
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,700
Saying you're
gonna lie in court?

512
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,300
Saying I don't
remember squat,

513
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,300
so don't hold your breath,
Goldilocks.

514
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,900
You want to question Tessie,
I need to be present.

515
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,700
And you are?

516
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,800
My brother.
Also my lawyer.

517
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,600
Fine.

518
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,700
Have a seat.

519
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,300
We know Sergeant Lafferty
gave your client a gun.

520
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,900
Same one that was used in
the murder of Mike Delaney.

521
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,800
And this witness is willing
to testify to that?

522
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,400
I didn't think so.

523
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,900
I know what it's like.
The nightmares.

524
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,900
Making you relive what happened,
over and over.

525
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,300
Is that a question
or a monologue?

526
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,900
And until you tell someone
what really happened,

527
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,700
the nightmares won't stop.

528
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,400
Believe me, Tessie.

529
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
I know.

530
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,200
He used me...

531
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,900
like a...

532
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,600
toilet.

533
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,500
You don't have
to talk to her.

534
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,800
And every time
he smiled at me,

535
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,800
I was right back on
that kitchen floor,

536
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,700
and...

537
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,500
his smell...

538
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,500
My client's done talking.

539
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
- No, no, we're not done here.
- Oh yeah, we are.

540
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,300
Yeah, you killed him,
didn't you, Tessie?

541
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,100
-  Oh, I wanted to.
- Tessie, shut up.

542
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,500
Nightmares won't stop,
till you tell me what you did.

543
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,200
Tell me.

544
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
We're done here.

545
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,400
Justifiable homicide,
you ask me.

546
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,000
I hear that.
Loud and clear.

547
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,300
Moot point.
Struck out on this one.

548
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,000
Nice try, Lil.

549
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,400
Yeah. Way to go, Lil.

550
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,300
It's not our jobs
to decide

551
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,300
which murders we
like or don't like.

552
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,600
Nah, our job

553
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,200
is to put away some kid
for doing the right thing.

554
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,700
So we let every vigilante walk?
That what you're saying?

555
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,300
Saying, maybe let this one.

556
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,300
Well, I need
to talk to her again.

557
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,700
Not gonna happen.
She's lawyered up.

558
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,600
What is it with you
and this case?

559
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,800
Why do you even care
about that scumbag?

560
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,200
It's not about him.

561
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,100
Then what?

562
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,000
'Cause I can't figure out
why you're wasting our time.

563
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,100
There's got to be a way
to talk to her, right, Boss?

564
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,400
Go home, Lil.

565
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,600
All of you. Please.

566
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
Quite a spread
you got here, John.

567
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,500
Hey.
Wasn't expecting you.

568
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,400
hey.

569
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,400
So how's it going
back at the ranch?

570
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,400
Say we take her out,
hit the high seas,

571
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,000
come back next year.

572
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,600
That bad, huh?

573
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,000
Well, chasing our
tails on this one.

574
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,000
Doer's gonna walk.
Rush won't let it go.

575
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,400
Well, she's got
good instincts, Will.

576
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,500
Let her follow them.

577
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,800
Sometimes being the boss means
staying out of their way.

578
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,700
I'm done playing
peacemaker.

579
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,100
I'm not cut out for it.

580
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,900
We need you back, John.

581
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,800
I got 31 years
on the job, Will.

582
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,100
Maybe it's time to have a life.

583
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,600
Ah, sunstroke
talking there.

584
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,300
I think I've lost
my taste for it.

585
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,300
The politics,
or the job?

586
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,900
There a difference?

587
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,700
Doing some reading?

588
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,000
Shaina's diary.

589
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,300
A few months before she
killed herself, this entry:

590
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,500
"I know I'm not alone

591
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,800
"in my pain.

592
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,500
"There are others
who wrote on The Wall.

593
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,800
He won't get away
with what he did."

594
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,100
Shaina knew about
the other girls?

595
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,600
Sounds like it.

596
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,100
So what's this "wall"
they wrote on?

597
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,700
Place on campus
where they could

598
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,600
leave messages.

599
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,800
Well, we know he picked up
his victims at the library.

600
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,900
Maybe there?

601
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,300
No internet chat rooms
back in '82.

602
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,400
A bulletin board maybe?

603
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,600
Some place girls could
communicate... privately..

604
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,000
Like a bathroom stall?

605
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,800
Old school chat room.

606
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,300
For men and women both.

607
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,000
Worth following up?

608
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,700
Do it.

609
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,200
You coming, Will?

610
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,400
Glad you asked.

611
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,100
I always wondered what
you ladies had in here.

612
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,200
Everything you got.

613
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,100
Not quite.

614
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,100
Think they'd clean
up this stuff,

615
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,500
time to time.

616
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Got it.

617
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
"MD." Michael Delaney.

618
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,300
"I told my dad and he said
it was my fault."

619
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,600
- Shaina.
- There's more.

620
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,400
Other girls.

621
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,700
"I told the Dean..."

622
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,100
<i>...and nothing happened.</i>

623
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,900
"I told the cops..."

624
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,500
<i>...and nothing happened.</i>

625
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,200
<i>He raped me, too.</i>

626
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,600
<i>I told my roommate,</i>
<i>and she said I asked for it.</i>

627
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,100
Karin wrote that.

628
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,700
"He raped me too and
I never told anyone..."

629
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,500
<i>He raped me, too,</i>
<i>and I never told anyone</i>

630
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,300
<i>'cause it was my fault.</i>

631
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
They lied.

632
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,400
They knew about each other.

633
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,500
And they made a plan.

634
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,300
To kill him.

635
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,600
Got Karin and Melinda here, too.

636
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,300
One of them's
gonna break.

637
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,200
You want to make a deal,
now's the time.

638
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,100
I didn't kill
Mike Delaney.

639
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,200
You did it together.

640
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,800
With Tessie, too.
We know that.

641
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,900
That is ridiculous.

642
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,000
Writing on the wall
says different, Regie.

643
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,700
Remember now?

644
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,000
<i>I told you.</i>

645
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,400
I wasn't raped.

646
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,600
Your handwriting gonna
match the wall, Melinda?

647
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,300
That was just...
stupid writing.

648
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,600
It didn't mean
anything.

649
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Sure it did.

650
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,400
Then Shaina
killed herself.

651
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,800
You had to make him pay.

652
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,600
I never even met her.

653
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,300
"No matter how much I try,
I just want it to end.

654
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,800
"I hope you won't
be mad at me.

655
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,900
I'm just not
as strong as you."

656
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,200
Shaina's last entry
in her diary.

657
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,800
It was dedicated
to you.

658
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,600
"The women on The Wall."

659
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,800
She was barely 18.

660
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,100
A kid.

661
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It isn't fair
what he did to her.

662
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,600
What he did to all of you.

663
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,800
<i>So you made a plan together.</i>

664
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,400
Waited on the quad
till nightfall.

665
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,300
Please, stop this.

666
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,300
And then you
saw him-- alone.

667
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,300
Coming from a party?

668
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,300
Or maybe another girl's room?

669
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,600
No one was going to stop him.

670
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,600
Except us.

671
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,400
He had that stupid smile
on his face.

672
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,700
Always that damn smile.

673
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,900
But then he saw us.

674
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,800
And he knew.

675
00:34:59,400 --> 00:34:59,700
It was...

676
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,300
...payback time.

677
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,200
Say what you did to us.

678
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,400
- What is this?
- You can't pretend

679
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,500
it didn't happen--
what you did

680
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,600
to all of us.

681
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,900
Why? Why'd you do it?

682
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,100
I didn't do anything.

683
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,500
You raped us.

684
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,600
Right. You're crazy.

685
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,500
Say it.

686
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,700
I don't have to listen to this.

687
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,700
Say it.

688
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

689
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,400
Say it.

690
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,500
Tessie, what are
you doing? Huh?

691
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,200
Say it, you son of a bitch.

692
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,800
Say what you did?

693
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,200
Say it!

694
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
He wet his pants.

695
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,400
That little piece of crap
wet his own pants.

696
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,000
How does it feel, huh?

697
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,800
- Kill him.
- Oh, my God, Tessie, don't.

698
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
- Please...
- Kill him, Tessie, now, do it.

699
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,900
Okay, okay, okay.

700
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Okay, I did it.

701
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,700
Say it!

702
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,900
I raped you.

703
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,300
Okay?

704
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,100
I'm so sorry.

705
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,100
I'm sorry, please...
please don't shoot me.

706
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,300
Please...

707
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,300
I can't.

708
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,800
What? Kill him
now, Tessie, do it!

709
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
I won't do it.

710
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,900
- I won't become him.
- Let's go home.

711
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,200
Please, Tessie.

712
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Let's go home.

713
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,800
Then we left him there.

714
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,800
We went back

715
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,200
to my dorm room and stayed
there until dawn.

716
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,000
And that's when we heard.
He was dead.

717
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,000
I was glad.

718
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,700
Thought it would make us better.

719
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,500
But it didn't.

720
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,100
You were together until
the next morning?

721
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,900
All of you?
Even Tessie?

722
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,400
No one left that room
until we got the news.

723
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,500
Then why'd Tessie's
brother lie?

724
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,000
Said she was with
him that night.

725
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,400
'Cause he was her alibi.

726
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,100
And she was his.

727
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,000
My client isn't saying
another word.

728
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,800
This isn't about
your client.

729
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
Trajectory of the bullet
indicates the shooter

730
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,400
was five-four, five-two,
average sized female.

731
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,100
Or a 12-year-old boy.

732
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,700
Real protective,
weren't you, Jimmy?

733
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,700
Parents were dead...

734
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,700
Making you the
man of the family.

735
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,600
You people are pathetic...

736
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,000
Tessie, don't
talk to them.

737
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,200
Kids know more
than we think.

738
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,000
Hear things,
see things.

739
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,700
Bottle it all up inside.

740
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,500
But it's killing you.

741
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,300
He was just a kid.

742
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,800
This is ridiculous.

743
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,700
Tell them, Jimmy.
You were home, right?

744
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,600
Right?

745
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Jimmy?

746
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,000
I saw him.

747
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,400
Leave the apartment.

748
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,200
I saw... everything.

749
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,000
Okay, I killed him.
I did it. Arrest me.

750
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,200
He wasn't sorry.

751
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,200
On the quad.

752
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,600
I followed you that night.

753
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,900
I was supposed
to protect you...

754
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,700
Jimmy, shut up!

755
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,700
I am confessing, okay?
I killed that animal.

756
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,600
No, you didn't.

757
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,700
Jimmy, don't do this.

758
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,000
I picked up the gun...

759
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,900
Stupid bitches...

760
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,800
whores...

761
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,300
Then what happened?

762
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,700
I had to protect you, Tess.

763
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,800
Please don't do
this to him.

764
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,700
He was just a little boy.

765
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,700
Don't do this to us,
not again.

766
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,800
You picked up the gun
because you were scared.

767
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,500
You thought you
were in danger.

768
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,400
Imminent danger,
didn't you, Jimmy?

769
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,300
Is she doing what I
think she's doing?

770
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,300
Didn't you...

771
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,200
I'm not hearing it. You?

772
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,600
Tell them yes, Jimmy.

773
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,100
You picked up the gun

774
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,600
because you thought
you were in danger.

775
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,600
Jimmy, do it
for me, please.

776
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,400
Just tell them the truth.

777
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,100
Tessie's little brother?

778
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
Jimmy, right?

779
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,600
She told me about you.

780
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,300
Come on, bud,
give me the gun.

781
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:13,700
So what you're saying
then is he came at you, right?

782
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,000
Grown man coming
at a 12-year-old boy,

783
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,300
who knows what he'd do?

784
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,400
Threat to your life.

785
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,300
Say yes, Jimmy. Please.

786
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,100
I know what you did to her.
To Tessie.

787
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,400
You got it all wrong, buddy.

788
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,300
No, she said no.

789
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,000
They all say that.

790
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,300
But they don't mean it.

791
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,200
You'll see one day.

792
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,200
I was there.
I heard everything.

793
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,200
Between you and me, kid?

794
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,200
Your sister was one
hell of a lay...

795
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,400
Shut up!

796
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,100
Then he moved in
for you, right?

797
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,900
Left you no choice.

798
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,200
You know the law.

799
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,600
You won't go away
for defending yourself.

800
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,200
Because you had to shoot,
didn't you, Jimmy?

801
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,500
You're all I got left.

802
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,400
Tell them.

803
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,400
I couldn't let him hurt you
ever again...

804
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,900
* You saw me standing
by the wall *

805
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,600
* Corner of a main street *

806
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:15,000
* And the lights are flashing
on your windowsill *

807
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,600
* Take a chance *

808
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:23,600
* Like all dreamers can't
find another way *

809
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,900
* You don't have
to dream at all *

810
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:32,000
* Just live a day *

811
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
* Don't say a prayer
for me now *

812
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,900
* Save it till
the morning after *

813
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:45,400
* No, don't say a prayer
for me now *

814
00:42:45,400 --> 00:43:02,400
* Save it till
the morning after *

815
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:10,800
* Save it
till the morning after *

816
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:19,300
* Save it till
the morning after *

817
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:28,400
* Save it
till the morning after *

818
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,200
* Do-do-do-do-do *

819
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,500
* Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do *

820
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:46,800
* Save a prayer
till the morning after *

821
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:55,200
* Save a prayer till
the morning after... *

822
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:08,200
