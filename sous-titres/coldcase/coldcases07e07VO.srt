00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,510
Hey, Meesha ?

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,770
Donalyn ? Can't wait to
show you your new room.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,420
Kenny painted it himself.
Right, Kenny ?

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,750
Hey, Meesha, you're going
to love your new school.

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,490
It has a swimming pool.

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,130
Yes !

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,200
We don't know how to swim.

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,170
Well, you can learn.

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,250
- Right, Meesha ?
- Yes, Mrs. Watson.

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,160
You don't have to call us
Mr. and Mrs. Watson anymore.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,670
We're family now.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,930
You can call us Alice, Kenneth.
Mom and Dad.

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,690
We already got a mom and dad.

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,760
We're gonna set some rules.

18
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,550
Curfew's 7:00 on school nights,
8:00 on weekends.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,520
Those streetlights cut on,
y'all in the house.

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,480
Hey, Meesha, look over there.

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,200
Donalyn, roll up your window.

22
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,640
("P.S.K. What Does it
Mean?" by Schoolly D playing)

23
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,830
Donalyn, do you hear me ?

24
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,020
I don't want you hangin'
on that corner.

25
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,540
My 11-year-old daughter
died last week.

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,570
Brain aneurysm.

27
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,130
Sorry about your loss.

28
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,630
That girl they found in the landfill
back in '91...

29
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,231
Donalyn Sullivan.

30
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,300
Yeah.

31
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,900
I tell you what I did...

32
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:51,901
I get to go to my daughter's funeral ?

33
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,770
Depends on what you got.

34
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,600
I found her dead in the basement
of my club.

35
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,940
- When was this ?
- November 18th.

36
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,700
The morning after my
27th birthday party.

37
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,430
We were having some plumbing done.

38
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,690
Might have got hit
with one of them pipes.

39
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,390
Might've ?

40
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,080
What'd you do with her body ?

41
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,290
I wrapped it in this zebra rug I had.

42
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,370
Put her in the dumpster
behind Checkers on 29th.

43
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,600
So you find a dead girl
in your club,

44
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:27,701
you toss her body in a dumpster
instead of calling the cops ?

45
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,300
I ran with the 26th Street Villains.

46
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,150
If they'd caught me talking to some
cops, I would have been six deep.

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,410
What's a 14-year-old girl
doing there in the first place ?

48
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,710
Wild night. Could have snuck in.

49
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,300
Now I know what her parents
must have felt...

50
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:46,101
losing a child.

51
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,330
I want to do what's right.

52
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,430
18 years too late.

53
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,710
Funeral home's holding
my daughter's body.

54
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,030
My wife is waiting for me.

55
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,950
You said it was your
birthday party, right ?

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,910
I'm gonna need names.

57
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,590
Club was abandoned in '97.

58
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,970
The city's got ownership now.

59
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,340
Hmm, your tax dollars at work.

60
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,600
The M.E.'s office confirmed
Donalyn was hit with an object.

61
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,910
About one-inch round.

62
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,250
Found a permit for a plumbing
overhaul back in '91.

63
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:29,151
Replaced lead pipes
with galvanized.

64
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,440
Detectives.

65
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:32,941
Let's ???? at the pipe.

66
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:40,742
Let's cut that section out.

67
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,850
Perfectly good murder weapon.

68
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,550
I'm guessing Sticky didn't
have a permit for that.

Read between the lines

72
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:24,891
Donalyn Sullivan.
14-year-old foster kid.

73
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:26,531
Biological parents both dead.

74
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,140
She and her little sister Meesha

75
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:31,341
moved in with Kenneth and Alice Watson
April '91.

76
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,090
Fourth foster family in five years.

77
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,950
Seven months later,
she's dead in a landfill.

78
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,300
Assigned searched for predators.
No recent rapes

79
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:39,501
or regular pervs.

80
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,570
Foster dad alibied out.

81
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,830
In Baltimore with a friend
the night Donalyn went missing.

82
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,750
Foster mom was at home
with the younger sister.

83
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,240
Donalyn sneaks out,
goes to Sticky's party.

84
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,590
Next morning, foster mom
files a missing persons.

85
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,990
It's three weeks before her
body's discovered at the dump.

86
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,130
Hey, look who's back from the dead.

87
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,010
Would of had a to-do
with some notice.

88
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,400
I thought I'd be hanging with
the zombies till retirement.

89
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,900
Still don't know how you did it, boss.

90
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,720
Still got some juice upstairs, I guess.
Glad to have you back, Kat.

91
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,380
M.E.'s report.

92
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,460
Piping in Sticky's basement

93
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:12,761
fits the thread pattern
on Donalyn's skull.

94
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,020
Blood type's a match, too.

95
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,550
Two items found on the victim.

96
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,760
Picture of her biological
mother and a busted audio tape.

97
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,370
I'll take it to the sound hounds.
See if they can work their magic.

98
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,060
Let's bring in the foster parents
and the sister,

99
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:25,361
see if Sticky's club jogs
their memories.

100
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,630
You got it, boss.

101
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,290
Hey, Nick.

102
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,740
Still waiting on that
doctor's report from you.

103
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,290
- Thought that was more of an optional thing.
- Only if you opt to wear the badge.

104
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,690
I haven't seen a doctor since 1980.

105
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,190
I don't even have one.

106
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,660
Then find one.

107
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,410
I don't believe it. I...

108
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:52,611
Donalyn wasn't the type of girl
to go clubbin'.

109
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,530
More of a homebody ?

110
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,220
Just wasn't all that social.

111
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,460
She spent most of her
time watching her sister.

112
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,020
Got a guest list from
Sticky's club that night.

113
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,000
Recognize any names ?

114
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,320
Friends of Donalyn's, maybe ?

115
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,980
If she had friends, I...
I didn't know any of them.

116
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,730
Told the girls to stay away
from those kids on 26th.

117
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,030
You mean the kids at school ?

118
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,150
These kids couldn't spell "school".

119
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,960
Told cops back in '91

120
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:21,161
you were in Baltimore
night Donalyn disappeared.

121
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,840
With my pal, James McDonald.
Fishing.

122
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,940
You still got his number ?

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,280
- Somewhere.
- When'd you come back home ?

124
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,730
As soon as Alice called,
said Donalyn was missing.

125
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,870
- She ever run away before?
- Not that I know of.

126
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,700
But Donalyn was a teenager.
Had a mind of her own.

127
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,150
She give Alice trouble ?

128
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,650
Told Alice those girls didn't need
sympathy. They needed discipline.

129
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,510
You ever discipline them, Kenneth ?

130
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,240
Alice got mad if I raised my voice.

131
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,410
Didn't let me smoke anymore.
Had all kind of rules.

132
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,680
How was your relationship
with Donalyn ?

133
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,450
I was gone a lot for work.

134
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,620
Did what I could when I was around.

135
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,020
I took her to see Phantom of
the Opera in New York once.

136
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,820
She liked that.

137
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,110
You and Alice divorced in '92 ?

138
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,910
Losing a child like that...

139
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:08,411
it just ripped us apart.

140
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,070
So Ken being away, two foster
kids, it must have been rough.

141
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,960
Life of a trucker's wife.

142
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,770
Might as well have been a single mother.

143
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,170
You and Donalyn get along?

144
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,660
Tried to create a family for her.

145
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,450
Girl was mad at the world.

146
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,710
Her mother was a addict.
Died of AIDS.

147
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,120
No father.

148
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,710
A tough life for a kid.

149
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,600
I was a first-time foster mom.

150
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,010
Thought I could change the world.

151
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,970
But what they say is true.

152
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,260
It's harder with the older ones.

153
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:42,261
<i>"Ladies first"
by Queen Latifah.</i>

154
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,850
Meesh, I'm Queen Latifah.

155
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,000
No, don't stop.

156
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,700
- What does she want ?
- Come on, you guys, keep going.

157
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,550
I got homework.

158
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:12,250
Hey,Donalyn,what do you say
tomorrow we have a girls' day?

159
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,360
Maybe... we could go shopping,
get our nails done ?

160
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,970
Whatever you want.

161
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,060
Please, Donalyn ?

162
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,830
What do you say ?

163
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,160
Give me a chance ?

164
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,290
Maybe ?

165
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,870
I'll do it for the drama queen.

166
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,660
Okay.

167
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,130
I took what I could get.

168
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,370
So Donalyn was close
with her younger sister ?

169
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,280
- Best friends.
- Is that Meesha ?

170
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,040
Yes.

171
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,280
Convinced DHS to let her live
with me after Donalyn died.

172
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,340
Adopted her in '95.

173
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,650
She's a doctor at Children's now.

174
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,470
You're reopening my sister's case ?

175
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,030
After all this time ?
I don't understand.

176
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,290
Got a new lead.

177
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,191
You ever hear of
Sticky's on 26th ?

178
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,880
Club was owned
by Virgil "Sticky" Jones.

179
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,270
Yeah.

180
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,480
She'd sneak up there whenever she could.

181
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,040
Is that where she was killed ?

182
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,040
I thought she ran away.

183
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,080
You recognize any of these names ?

184
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,700
How'd she get out of the house ?

185
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,240
Just went out the back door.

186
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,810
You ever tell your parents
about Donalyn's night life ?

187
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,720
I wanted a family, Donalyn didn't.

188
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,480
After she left,

189
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:39,481
after I thought she left,
all I had was my mother.

190
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,660
What about Kenneth ?

191
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,420
Never saw him after they divorced.

192
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,940
He was never much around,
anyway.

193
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,370
Wait... Zen.

194
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,780
I remember him.

195
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,390
Friend of Donalyn's ?

196
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,020
I wouldn't go that far.

197
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,880
We met him the first
week in the neighborhood.

198
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,080
He messed with the wrong new girl.

199
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,660
Let the crowd get hype,
then I'm about to strike him

200
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,920
And watch me give him dap
with a fist full of lightnin'

201
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,930
So cool off,
you don't want it with me

202
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,670
"'Cause I freeze up suckaz
when I cold get busy,"

203
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,090
"especially you, man, your style's
a disgrace, you got a messed-up fade"

204
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,080
"and your chain's a fake.
And look at her,"

205
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,640
"she ain't fresh at all,
she got dirty shoes"

206
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,910
"and her clothes are small.
I'm the black Balboa"

207
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,450
"and I'm trained to brawl."

208
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,751
"The only trainin' she got
is a trainin' bra."

209
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,990
"You got a mouth full of rubbish
I'm-a take out the trash"

210
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:46,491
"Here's a penny for my thoughts,
"'Cause you prob'ly could use the cash

211
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,920
"You a broke-lookin' player,
a faker, a straight fool. "

212
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,040
"Word on the street is
that you got a little issue."

213
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,710
You funny, right ?

214
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,030
This is my street, bitch.

215
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,100
26... we never forget.

216
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,560
I see you again...
gonna earn my bones.

217
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,470
Come on, Meesh.

218
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,130
I always thought she was fearless,

219
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:33,331
but she was just a little girl.

220
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,200
Zen was a 26th Street Villain ?

221
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,390
Heard he shot a guy for his Jordans.

222
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,940
Happen to know his real name ?

223
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,270
Yeah.

224
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:42,971
I think Zeb Edwards.

225
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,400
Thanks, Meesha.

226
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,250
You'll let me know if
you find anything, right ?

227
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,440
All right.

228
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,710
So, Zeb and Sticky were 26ers.

229
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:01,411
Maybe Zeb ran into Donalyn
at the birthday party.

230
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,690
Got back at her over that
"little issue" of his.

231
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,520
Zen ?

232
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,610
- Just Zeb now.
- Zeb Edwards :

233
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,680
popped in '92 for ag assault,
'93 criminal conspiracy,

234
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:25,381
94 possession with intent.

235
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,930
People say this and that.

236
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,930
But 26ers never forget...

237
00:13:29,331 --> 00:13:31,231
what you told Donalyn Sullivan

238
00:13:31,232 --> 00:13:33,132
after she outspit you on 26th.

239
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,010
Come on. I changed.

240
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,160
Look,I'm a family man now.

241
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,490
Were you at Sticky's
birthday party in '91 ?

242
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,440
Nah, it wasn't me.

243
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,650
Why were you
on the guest list, Zen ?

244
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,770
Start talkin' straight,
or I take out the bracelets.

245
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,600
What you wanna know?

246
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,180
The night Donalyn was killed,
you two still beefin' ?

247
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,920
- Nah, me and Sugar Dawn, we was friends
by then. / - Sugar Dawn ?

248
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,360
Yeah,it's the name I gave her.

249
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,450
What kind of friendship you have
with a 14-year-old girl ?

250
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,030
Nah, it wasn't like that.

251
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:04,131
I was her manager.

252
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,950
Yeah, turned her into
a bona fide MC.

253
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,190
Back then, you either was a
talent or you found the talent.

254
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,440
All right, look, you wanna do this,
you gotta look the part, all right ?

255
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,970
Here, put this... Damn !

256
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,050
Not like I'm gonna hit you.

257
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,580
I can do it myself.

258
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,410
All right, where the earrings
and the ring I got you ?

259
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,510
You gotta put 'em on.

260
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,890
Put your rings on.

261
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:36,891
<i>"Act Like You Know"
by MC Lyte.</i>

262
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,990
Put the hat on.

263
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,630
Cool ?

264
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,680
Ah, now there she go.
That's Sugar Dawn.

265
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,500
Zen, get the little girl
outta here.

266
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,480
Yo, she's dope, man.
She got mad skills.

267
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,450
Hey, you was on 26th
and Sergeant

268
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:13,551
first day me and my sister
moved over there.

269
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,970
Yo, Sugar Dawn,

270
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:17,771
go ahead and spit
that 16 real quick.

271
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,660
"Fly Philly diva,
sicker than emphysema"

272
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:26,661
"Make you follow
the leader in my Jetta"

273
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,240
"four-seater Guys love Sugar 'cause
you know they want to meet her"

274
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,630
"Girls want to join her 'cause they
know they can't beat her."

275
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,620
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

276
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,270
Yo, I'm tellin' you, man, she's
gonna be the next Antoinette.

277
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,820
She just another girl on
26th thinks she can rap.

278
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,230
"I said it once, I'm-a say it again"

279
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:45,731
"I'm like Nikki Giovanni"

280
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,120
"when I pick up the pen"

281
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:49,421
"So, Go Tell It on the Mountain"

282
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,730
"I'll take it back to the Motherland now
And I don't need a black medallion..."

283
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,980
I know I can rap.

284
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,850
All right, you can stay.

285
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,030
Man, the only reason why y'all lovin'
her is 'cause she's still in diapers.

286
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,980
She a baby MC.

287
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,550
I mean, she look like me, y'all got
her rappin' like me,

288
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:19,451
but she ain't me.

289
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,650
Oh, I don't know. I think
she got you there, Big Soph.

290
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,350
Who, her ?

291
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,450
- Man, get your finger out my face.
- I know that's not what just happened !

292
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,610
I know you didn't just
disrespect me like that !

293
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,300
You know, you getter watch
your back !

294
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,970
Don't let me catch your ass
on 26th, 'cause I got you !

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,650
I should've protected Sugar Dawn more.

296
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,430
Big Soph was crazy.

297
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,840
She at Sticky's party that night ?

298
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,710
Yeah, she got a big recording
contract.

299
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,010
Sugar Dawn was supposed
to spit for a contract, too,

300
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,411
but she never showed.

301
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,470
Yeah. Yeah, it was the night
the Phillies ended the game

302
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:58,771
on that triple play.

303
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,470
You remember who was
workin' the parking lot ?

304
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,820
Last name Parker ?

305
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,340
Emil Parker ?

306
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,360
He'll be back Saturday ?

307
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,700
All right, thanks.

308
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:17,118
So, any luck with the
foster father's alibi ?

309
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,764
Number Ken gave us
for James McDonald

310
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:21,165
was disconnected back in '97.

311
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,090
Ran down the forwarding number.
There's no answer.

312
00:17:24,955 --> 00:17:26,130
Uh, where's mine ?

313
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,615
I thought you gave up the cow.

314
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:34,200
I'm gone a couple weeks and
all of a sudden I'm vegetarian ?

315
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,434
A/V department was able to save
part of Donalyn's audiotape.

316
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,595
Listen.

317
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:43,596
<i>Different foster homes but
don't none of them care</i>

318
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,375
<i>And I hate to see my sister cry,
'cause that ain't fair </i>

319
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,605
<i>She's too young to understand
how we ended up here</i>

320
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,830
<i>So I promise that'll change
every single new year.</i>

321
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,100
A/V's trying to rescue
the rest of the tape.

322
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,425
And I've been harassing
DHS to open Donalyn's file.

323
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,425
Know a gal over there.
I'll,uh,reach out.

324
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,565
Pretty heavy lyrics
for a 14-year-old.

325
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,420
Veronica's around Donalyn's age.

326
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,335
I can't imagine her
going through any of this.

327
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,421
Thanks, Scotty.

328
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,485
We got the big guns.

329
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,570
The lieutenant and the lady detective.

330
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,855
Deserve special treatment, being the
voice of Philly Hip-Hop on Radio 99.

331
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,271
And I'm on in 45.

332
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,945
Looks like you're gonna
miss drive time, Big Soph.

333
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,445
Police harassin' another person
of color's no big surprise.

334
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,872
Ah, a couple of Philly cops
don't scare you.

335
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,025
Especially since you're so good
with a razor blade.

336
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,869
Served three years at Muncy
for assault.

337
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,525
Bitch had it comin'.

338
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,831
You call me in for somethin'
that happened a hundred years ago ?

339
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,335
Remember Donalyn Sullivan ?

340
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,552
Maybe you know her
as Sugar Dawn ?

341
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,295
Yeah, I remember Sugar Dawn.

342
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,705
Yeah, me... me and Baby MC,
we was cool.

343
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,072
- You ever threaten her ?
- She was a kid.

344
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:00,473
Didn't tell her to watch her back ?

345
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,185
Heat of the moment,maybe.

346
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,945
You got signed with Killadelphia
Entertainment in '91.

347
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,070
Did.

348
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:10,857
What's your point ?

349
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,610
You got your big break
at Sticky's on 26th.

350
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,205
At his birthday party. So ?

351
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,685
Same night and place
Sugar Dawn was murdered.

352
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,145
See where we're going now ?

353
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,785
Like I said, I didn't see her.

354
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,245
Donalyn was there to
audition that night,too.

355
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,765
She's dead, you're famous.
Do the math.

356
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,585
Look, Sugar Dawn was on 26th with the big
dogs, but she was still wet behind the ears.

357
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,560
I tried to help !

358
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,670
<i>"Bad as a Mutha"
by Queen Latifah.</i>

359
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,210
Oh, you like rap music ?

360
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,141
Hey, man...

361
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,383
Yo, Baby MC, come here.

362
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,660
For real, come here. I ain't
gonna do nothin', all right ?

363
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,238
How much you sellin'
your tapes for ?

364
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,895
A Hamilton.

365
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,354
You buggin', right ?

366
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,375
Zen didn't tell me how much.

367
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,145
All right, check this.

368
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,255
Look at homeboy over there
in the fake Karl Kani's.

369
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,575
You ask him for ten,
he gonna shut you down.

370
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,874
That's a five-dolla' brotha'.

371
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,234
So you only charge people
what you think they'll pay, see ?

372
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,993
And another thing,
you want to take all this off.

373
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:19,105
All what off ?

374
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,234
All that jewelry, unless you trying to get jacked
out here trying to look like Big Soph and all.

375
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,670
Come on.

376
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,850
You still in diapers, so make it work.

377
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,080
Never ask more than $15, all right ?

378
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,894
Go do it.

379
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:43,195
Go on. Go ahead.

380
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,577
Hey, man, you like hip-hop ?

381
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,750
Told you !

382
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:04,012
Where's my money ?

383
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,215
- What money ?
- From your studio time.

384
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,130
- Zen said he'd front it.
- Well, he didn't.

385
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,360
Huxtable, she's just a kid.

386
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,019
Is anybody talking to you ?

387
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,352
Got $20.

388
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,277
I could page Zen and see
if he can bring some more.

389
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,749
No, we're gonna find him
together.

390
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,410
Get in the damn car!

391
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,830
Huxtable was serious about his paper.

392
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,490
That was the last time
I saw Sugar Dawn.

393
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,095
When was that ?

394
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,136
Two days before Sticky's party.

395
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,773
That thing we talked about.

396
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,020
Happy anniversary.

397
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,815
Some guys bring flowers.

398
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,879
A dozen roses ain't got
nothing on six hollow points.

399
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,213
You know I already got a piece.

400
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:24,490
Yeah, but yours comes with
too many questions attached.

401
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,978
Still... think I could take it back ?
Get some diamond studs ?

402
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,370
Real ones ?

403
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,715
No refunds, no exchanges.

404
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,940
- Also, completely untraceable.
- Seriously, Eddie.

405
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:42,278
Look, you asked me what I'd do in
your situation. A guy like that ?

406
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,447
Well... Just be careful.

407
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,875
You been under too long.

408
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,371
Maybe things start
looking kind of cloudy, huh ?

409
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,415
Couldn't be clearer
from where I'm standing.

410
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,035
Scum out there wants you dead.

411
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,335
- I'm just evening the odds.
- Look, I told you before.

412
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,800
I don't need protecting.

413
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,385
Well, the beauty of a thing like this ?

414
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,070
You can put it away.
Forget about it.

415
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,645
Unless the time comes when you need it.

416
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,560
- Then you decide where you stand.
- I already know where I stand.

417
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:19,238
I'm just looking out, okay ?

418
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:23,860
Diamonds, huh ?

419
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:28,626
Wait.

420
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,826
Let me think about it.

421
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:33,988
Okay ?

422
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,102
Huxtable, huh ?

423
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:56,684
Whatever happened to good old street
names like Chicken Legs and Fat Head ?

424
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,034
Who's asking ?

425
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,175
What can I do for you, detectives ?

426
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,235
Mortuary playlist his idea or yours ?

427
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,527
Keeps the mind active.

428
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:11,199
Family business here is a long way away from
that one-bedroom music studio you used to run.

429
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,713
I'm still in the scene.
I find underground talent.

430
00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:15,370
Post their songs on my blog.

431
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,155
You know a Donalyn Sullivan ?

432
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,403
Sure. She was a friend of mine.

433
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,711
Remember her taking a ride
in your Cherokee ?

434
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:24,112
November '91 ? Just you and her ?

435
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:26,375
- What are you getting at ?
- Is that a yes ?

436
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:27,575
Look, she was a little girl.

437
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,204
Got an eyewitness, saw you throw
that little girl in your Cherokee,

438
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:31,705
take off down Broad Street.

439
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,956
Okay, the whole neighborhood knew
my family owned this mortuary.

440
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:37,515
They knew I had money.
Had to show them I was hard.

441
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,315
Jack and Jill kid looking
for some street cred.

442
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,860
l had to play the game.
We both did.

443
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,170
What were you doing at Broad Street ?
You know it's dangerous this time of night.

444
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,450
What do you care where I'm at ?

445
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,490
Everybody's not out to take
something from you, little sister.

446
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,180
Well you want your money,
so there. That's all I got.

447
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,910
Zen shouldn't have you out there.

448
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,850
- I can take care of myself.
- I got something for you.

449
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,030
Back seat.

450
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,640
James Baldwin.
"Go Tell It on the Mountain".

451
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,520
- I already read it.
- I don't doubt it.

452
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,170
I knew you were different.

453
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,570
Don't need Zen turning you
into one of Big Soph's clones.

454
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,980
- Shoot, she ain't got nothing on me.
- Your single sucks.

455
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,300
Did you write it ?

456
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,130
- Zen.
- That figures. It's trivial.

457
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,640
Trivial sells.

458
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,610
How many tapes you sold today ?

459
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,060
You got more inside you.
Spit about something real.

460
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:33,761
Not some cliche ghetto
nursery rhyme.

461
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,660
Oh, like you, college boy ?

462
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,680
Fronting like your mommy and daddy ain't
paying for your apartment on Chestnut.

463
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,740
But I don't have what you got.

464
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,680
You're more than just
another MC, Donalyn.

465
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,460
Everybody's got dreams.
Don't mean nothin'.

466
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,260
The difference is, you got talent.

467
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,140
And you're smart.

468
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,270
How old are you ?

469
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,130
14 and a half.

470
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,090
And a half.

471
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,560
What's that mean ?

472
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,570
Maybe you should just be 14.

473
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,960
- Let the half take care of itself.
- Yeah.

474
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,080
- Yeah.
- Maybe.

475
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,450
Hey,can you pull over at
that pay phone for a minute ?

476
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,650
Yeah. Um...

477
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,530
I guess I got through to her.
Cost her her life, though.

478
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,240
Who'd Donalyn call ?

479
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,760
Zen. She fired him right there.

480
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,450
How'd he take that ?

481
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,930
He was a 26er.

482
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,400
So, how do you think he took it ?

483
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,480
My father and I prepared her
for burial.

484
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,660
I hardly recognized her.

485
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,970
Said you turned Sugar
Dawn into a bona fide MC.

486
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,880
Before me, she was just
another girl roasting on 26th.

487
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,560
But Sugar Dawn was looking
to change her image.

488
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,780
But she never told me.

489
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,540
But she wanted to rap about
more than cars and jewelry.

490
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,020
She'd rap about a dog if I told her.

491
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,960
- Sugar Dawn dropped you,Zen.
- Please.

492
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,340
I put her on the map.

493
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,040
Well, the neighborhood map.

494
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,570
But she wanted more.

495
00:27:10,571 --> 00:27:12,671
14 and she already outgrew you.

496
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,070
A 26er like you wasn't
just gonna take that.

497
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,000
Told you,

498
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,001
I had nothing to do
with what happened to Sugar Dawn.

499
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,150
Y'all just be wanting to have
the brothers all gripped up.

500
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,770
You'll be gripping 20 years
in Graterford,

501
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:25,171
you don't drop that attitude
and come clean.

502
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,460
She fired me,all right?

503
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,160
But that lasted about half a second.

504
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,310
We on 1050 A.M.!

505
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,100
I know it's only a indie station,
but it's something.

506
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,320
Skills of an MC boss...

507
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,830
Go,go,go,go,go,go... Yo,we on the radio!

508
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,570
All right,so look. Sticky's birthday
party is tomorrow night, right ?

509
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,870
Everybody's gonna be there.

510
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,250
Now one of Sticky's boys promised me
a one-on-one

511
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:03,851
with Killadelphia Entertainment.

512
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,400
You do "Goin' Off".

513
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,730
I don't want to do "Goin' Off".

514
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,170
What you talking about ?
That's your single.

515
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,160
I'm saying I want to do
one of my own songs, Zen.

516
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,080
- Spit about something real.
- Aw, you playin', D, right ?

517
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,760
- Come on, man, you're killing me.
- I'm serious.

518
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,230
What, you on some old Negro spiritual
now from Huxtable ?

519
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,870
Man, people don't dance to that.

520
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,400
Maybe I just want them to listen.

521
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,340
What do you know about life ?

522
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,750
Nothing.

523
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,280
"The room was pitch black
when the chandelier fell"

524
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:50,990
"The first time he reached out, I remember
it well Whispered lies in my ear,"

525
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,510
"'cause he told me he cared"

526
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:56,311
"I saw a different kind of Phantom
In the way that he stared."

527
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,420
What Phantom ?

528
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,220
"Still my face can't reveal
what I'm feeling inside"

529
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:09,770
But you can see it if you look into my eyes
Read between the lines.

530
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,250
What are you talking about, D ?

531
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,030
I do my song or I'm out.

532
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,680
That's what I'm talking about.

533
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,510
Girl blew me away with that song.

534
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,440
Do you know who she was talking about ?

535
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,750
Only heard the first verse.

536
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,280
Next night at Sticky's party,
I waited for her backstage.

537
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,380
- She never showed.
- Anyone verify that ?

538
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,110
I got some names.

539
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,540
She was like a little sister to me,man.

540
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,790
If I'd have known
she was in trouble,

541
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:59,791
I would have done anything
to protect her.

542
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,930
You need to do what you need to do.
I'm going to put you on blast, okay ?

543
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:14,800
I...I wasn't expecting you.

544
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,740
I got to work late.

545
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,340
Just wanted to drop by.

546
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,300
Everything copacetic ?

547
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,420
Sit down.

548
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,200
We about to have "the talk"?

549
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,680
Uh, this thing that you
did the other night.

550
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,260
The gift I gave you ?

551
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,860
- You didn't have to.
- No. I wanted to.

552
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,580
I'm saying, I like you either way.

553
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,840
I don't need any grand gestures.

554
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,060
Okay.

555
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,690
Whatever my problems are,
they're mine.

556
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,830
I hear what you're saying.

557
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,540
You want me to back off.

558
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:00,170
I just need some room to maneuver.

559
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,440
If that's what you want,
that's what you get.

560
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,210
Thank you.

561
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:22,700
- Now,that thing... from the other night...
- Yeah,I threw it in the Schuylkill.

562
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,440
Well, no harm, no foul.

563
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:30,210
- Got to do it the right way.
- Just got to do it my way.

564
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,510
Just got off the horn
with James McDonald,

565
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:50,711
foster dad's alibi.

566
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,990
Finally grew a conscience,
admitted that Kenny Watson's lying.

567
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,280
- He wasn't fishing in '91.
- So, where was he ?

568
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,360
He was with his girlfriend
Lisa Jackson up in D.C.

569
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,400
Met her when she was 15.

570
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,930
A/V finally salvaged the
rest of Donalyn's tape.

571
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,990
Got the other verses to her song.

572
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,480
She called Ken the "Phantom".

573
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,350
Guess he'd turned his eye on her.

574
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,080
"He sees it, too,
now he's telling me to run away."

575
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,880
"But I got Babygirl with me.
Where we gonna stay ?"

576
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,850
Alibi's not the only thing
Kenneth lied about.

577
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,150
Mr. Watson ?

578
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,900
Detectives ?

579
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,660
Need to ask you some questions.

580
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,630
Let me take the chains off.

581
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,480
- Mr. Watson ?
- You got to open that door right now.

582
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,410
Perv knew we were on to him, boss.

583
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,060
- Ate his gun before we could get him.
- Took the easy way out.

584
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,500
Should've killed himself in '91.
Saved us the hassle.

585
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,470
Any proof he was molesting Donalyn ?

586
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,470
Jailbait magazines all over the place.

587
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,480
Donalyn rapped about a
Phantom on her audio tape.

588
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,630
Think she was talking about Kenneth.

589
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,140
Guy was a predator.
Killed her to cover it up.

590
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,320
We're gonna need more than that.
Let's bring in Alice.

591
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,830
Pick up Meesha,too.Find out what
was really going on in that house.

592
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,880
These are Donalyn's DHS records.

593
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,600
Says she lived with a family called
the Martins for a month, but not you ?

594
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,110
It was the only time we were separated.

595
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,950
She hated it there.

596
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,210
Not the whole story, Meesha.

597
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,510
Another girl reported
she was abused there.

598
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,700
Said Donalyn was,too.

599
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,880
She never told me.

600
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,000
She never told anyone.

601
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,010
She ever talk about a "Phantom" ?

602
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,830
Something she made up
to scare me.

603
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,840
"Lock your doors so the Phantom
doesn't come."

604
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:57,741
You know, kid stuff.

605
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:02,060
Ken took Donalyn to see
"Phantom of the Opera", though.

606
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,660
Right ?

607
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,220
What are you telling me ?

608
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,120
Not me, your sister.

609
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,470
<i>But lately it's been getting
harder just to pretend<i>

610
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,510
<i>'Cause once again I see
the Phantom when I see him </i>

611
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,350
<i>He sees it, too,
now he's telling me to run away</i>

612
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:25,151
<i>But I got Babygirl with me,
where we gonna stay ?</i>

613
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,900
I remember that song...

614
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,570
- I wasn't tryin' to hurt you.
- Of course you were.

615
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,940
<i>He sees it, too,
now he's telling me to run away</i>

616
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:42,041
<i>But I got Babygirl with me,
where we gonna stay ?</i>

617
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,140
What's that supposed to mean, huh ?

618
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,600
Look at me, Donalyn.

619
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,870
After all we've done for you.

620
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,950
Man, he wants me outta here.

621
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,910
He told me to beat it before
something bad happened.

622
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,880
- He didn't say that.
- I've seen that look before. I know what comes next.

623
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,900
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Think I'm some kinda little kid?

624
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,940
You're 14.

625
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,970
You don't know what I've been through.

626
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:12,120
And I'm not about to let it happen
again to me or my little sister.

627
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,210
Let what happen again ?

628
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,710
You say you love us, right ?

629
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,880
Donalyn, please.

630
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm trying here.

631
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,460
Kenny's trying.

632
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,920
Meesha's trying.
Everybody's trying but you.

633
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,221
Oh, God.

634
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,400
- Where are you going ?
- I'm outta here.

635
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,320
Donalyn, wait ! Don't go !

636
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,710
All this time... 

637
00:35:54,911 --> 00:35:57,711
I thought
Donalyn abandoned me.

638
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,360
She was just trying to save me.

639
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,920
You see Donalyn after that ?

640
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,210
No.

641
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,510
That was the last time
I saw my big sister.

642
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,180
What about Alice ?

643
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,700
She said she stayed home
all night with you. That true ?

644
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,660
You divorced in '92.

645
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,270
Irreconcilable differences.

646
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:32,940
I'll bet it was a challenge when you
found out about Kenneth'stendencies.

647
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,320
There's no reconciling those,  right ?

648
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,510
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

649
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,680
You're protecting him ? Even now ?

650
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,940
Kenny was a decent man.
Hard worker, a good provider.

651
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,330
No, he was a predator.

652
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,490
He knew we had his number.
There's a reason he offed himself.

653
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,640
That's between him and God.

654
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,470
He can't hurt you anymore, Alice.

655
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,160
Can't hurt you or the girls.

656
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,070
Tell us what happened.

657
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,290
You'll feel better, I promise.

658
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,470
He followed her to the club.

659
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,440
To Sticky's ?

660
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,940
I told him what she said.

661
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,970
About taking Meesha away.

662
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:25,190
He was supposed to talk
some sense into her.

663
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,560
But she wouldn't listen ?

664
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,670
No.

665
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,420
Said he hit her over
the head with a pipe.

666
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,260
He told me he killed her.

667
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,430
It's a gripping story... Alice.

668
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,280
What ?

669
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,520
He couldn't have been at the
club 'cause he was in Maryland.

670
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,540
Lookit.

671
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:00,641
Had a room at the Bethesda Inn
with his 17-year-old girlfriend.

672
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,250
Sevente... ?

673
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,570
No. No, he-he came back home.

674
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,080
He went after her. He told me.

675
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,450
The only person who'd know
Donalyn was beat with a pipe

676
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:13,351
was the one did the beatin'...

677
00:38:13,952 --> 00:38:15,452
that's you.

678
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:23,070
It's over, Alice.

679
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,130
She was gonna take Meesha away.

680
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,020
I couldn't let them go.

681
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,410
You took Kenneth's side.

682
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,700
No. No, God help me, no.
I kicked Kenneth out.

683
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,460
I wasn't...

684
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:43,861
I wasn't going to let him
near Meesha !

685
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:51,220
Please... tell Meesha I'm sorry.

687
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,280
Hey, Donalyn...

688
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,700
What are you doing here ?

689
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,140
We need to talk.

690
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,970
Come on.

691
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,970
I know you're angry, Donalyn,

692
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:37,071
but you can't just keep running

693
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:38,972
and dragging this little girl
behind you.

694
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,730
I've been taking care
of Meesha all her life.

695
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,490
Families talk.

696
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,480
They stick it out.

697
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,940
Well, we ain't your family.

698
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,710
But you could be.

699
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,410
You said it yourself,
nothing happened.

700
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,810
We're leaving tomorrow.

701
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,740
Please, don't do this to Meesha.

702
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,020
Meesha ?

703
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,950
All you talk about is Meesha !

704
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,360
You don't care nothing about me !

705
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,050
Who do you think
I'm talking about now ?

706
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:09,900
You, Donalyn. Don't you want
to be happy ?

707
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,710
Hey, I'm not gonna pretend no more.

708
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,950
I'm going out there tonight.
I'm gonna get me a contract.

709
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,210
Then you're never gonna see us again.

710
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,250
You can't sing that song !
I won't let you take her away !

711
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,920
You're just a child !

712
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,160
Old enough to call our social worker.

713
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,450
Tell her everything ! Then
you'll never get any more kids !

714
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,250
Shut your mouth !
I won't let you do that !

715
00:40:32,251 --> 00:40:33,551
You're not taking her !

716
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,440
Oh, no ! Donalyn ?

717
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,480
Oh, God !

718
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,620
No ! Oh,no ! I'm sorry !

719
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:50,821
Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

720
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,380
Donalyn ?

721
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,840

Big Soph,</i>

voice of Philly Hip-Hop Radio 99 FM.

723
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,260
Gonna take you back to the '90s.

724
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,640
Yeah, you know how we do it.

725
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,410
Authentic hip-hop.

726
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,800
Gonna play you a new joint
by former street MC,

727
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,101
Donalyn Sullivan,
murdered back in '91.

728
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,460
It's called "Read Between the Lines".

729
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,690
Shout out to 26th and Sergeant.

730
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,230
She's one of our own.

731
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,250
This one's for us.
