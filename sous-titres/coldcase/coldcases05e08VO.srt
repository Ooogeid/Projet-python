1
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,500
Ma-Two, can I go to Record City?

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,400
What for?

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,000
To buy some
more of that

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,600
hippity-hop mess?

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,300
They got this new CD
I want.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,800
Dinner's almost ready.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,200
And you're spending
too much time

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,900
listenin' to that nonsense
as it is.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,900
It ain't nonsense.

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,800
And I already ate.
On my way home from school.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,700
Good, then you can keep me
company.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,600
- I eat with you every day.
- That's a blessing,

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,700
not a curse.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,700
My home cooking
and good company...

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,700
Something to be envied.
Yeah, I know.

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,900
If you want to go somewhere,

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,900
why don't you go down
to the church youth center

18
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,500
and try to make some friends?

19
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,600
Nobody ever says nothin'
to me there.

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,600
Take them headphones off
and maybe they will

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,300
next time.

22
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,100
You gotta learn how
to speak up, baby.

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,800
You really not gonna
let me go?

24
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,200
But we're talkin'
about my future, Ma-Two.

25
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,900
If I start my own label,
I can get you a phat crib.

26
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,600
Give you the kind of life
you deserve.

27
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,200
Go set the table, Shemar.

28
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,500
Storage company called
this morning, Lil.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,200
Management got a complaint
about a foul odor,

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,200
strange leak
in one of the units.

31
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,300
Freezer shorted.
Started leaking fluids.

32
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,000
Unis found this inside.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,700
Shemar Reynolds.
12 years old.

34
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,000
Missing since August.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Last seen on his way home
from school.

36
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,400
Family's probably still hoping
for a safe return.

37
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,400
Don't they always.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,500
ID'd him pretty fast.

39
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,100
Kid's earring helped.

40
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,100
We matched it
to Missing Persons.

41
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,000
Slashing his face

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,400
- wasn't enough?
- Took off his finger.

43
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,700
- A souvenir maybe?
- Takes a lot

44
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,300
of rage to do that to a kid.

45
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,800
Doer soundproofed this place.

46
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,500
- Muffled the noise.
- Lieutenant.

47
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,000
Tracking the name on the unit.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,100
Rented to a Theo Gamble.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,900
What is it?

50
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,300
Three other storage units
in North Philly were rented

51
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,700
under that same name.

52
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,600
We got a serial.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,900
He killed four kids
that we know of.

57
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,100
Victim number one.

58
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Damont Henderson.

59
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,900
- Age 12.
- Last seen at Northland Mall.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,200
October '99.

61
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,900
Next, Kendrick Malone.

62
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,900
Nine years old.

63
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,200
Left his house to meet friends.

64
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,600
July 2001.

65
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,800
Never seen again.

66
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,300
Number three:
Marcus Hollister.

67
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,600
- 14.
- He went missing

68
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
from his block,

69
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
March 27, 2003.

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,900
And Shemar Reynolds.

71
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,100
The most recent,
12 years old.

72
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,800
Disappeared three months ago.

73
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,000
And Missing
Persons

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
never raised
an eyebrow.

75
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,400
- Great.
- Cause of death:

76
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,800
he slit their throats.

77
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,200
Slashed their faces.

78
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,500
Personal--
doing that.

79
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,800
So maybe he knew them.

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,200
All different ages,
different parts of North Philly.

81
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,400
Nothing in common.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,900
They all come
from tough neighborhoods.

83
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,300
No way our guy
just waltzed in there.

84
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,700
Had to be familiar.

85
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Took off their left
index fingers.

86
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,400
Postmortem.

87
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
'Cause not just
any finger would do

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,400
for this crackjob.

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,200
The victims sustained
shin splints,

90
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,600
abrasions under
their feet.

91
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
They were alive.

92
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,800
Their stomachs were empty.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
Initial stages
of starvation.

94
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,900
No signs
of sexual assault.

95
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,200
Meaning he didn't kill them
right away.

96
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,300
So what was he doing

97
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,200
with them?

98
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,300
We got a print

99
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,600
off the lock on the freezer
in Shemar's unit.

100
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,500
Running it now.

101
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,600
All the other units
were wiped clean. Every inch.

102
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,300
The bodies, too.
Not one hair or fiber on 'em.

103
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,200
Takes a lot of discipline, care,
not leave a trace like that.

104
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,600
What about

105
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
the name on the units?

106
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,500
- Theo Gamble.
- Ran it through DMV.

107
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,800
Guy doesn't exist.

108
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,700
Great.

109
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,500
Families are here.

110
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,100
Lil, you
and Scotty talk

111
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,800
to the storage
managers.

112
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,600
Yeah.

113
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,500
The rest of us talk to them?

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,500
Before the media catches hold,

115
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,400
plasters it all over the news.

116
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Yeah.

117
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,400
Waiting ain't gonna make it
any easier.

118
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,300
You and Damont were at the mall
when he went missing?

119
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,100
He didn't want to be seen
with his moms anymore.

120
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,500
So he went off
on his own.

121
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,200
Do you know
where exactly?

122
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,700
I waited for him
at the usual spot.

123
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,900
Damont never showed.

124
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
I spoke to detectives.

125
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,800
Over the years.

126
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,700
Didn't nobody mention to me

127
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,900
that there were other boys
missing.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,900
Why?

129
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,200
They had to know

130
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,100
that monster was out there.
Didn't they?

131
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,800
Says here your son
Marcus got caught up

132
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,200
- with a gang.
- My son had his troubles,

133
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,800
but he wasn't
no banger.

134
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,500
The night he
went missing

135
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,400
he told you he was
going to the store?

136
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,700
To get what?

137
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,300
Popsicles.

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,200
Boys and Girls Club was
hosting a science fair.

139
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,400
Marcus needed sticks

140
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,800
for a bridge he was building.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
- Could he have stopped somewhere else?
- No.

142
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,500
Marcus knew I'd worry

143
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,900
and he was anxious
to get that bridge done.

144
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,300
I asked this one cop

145
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,000
about putting out one of them,
uh..

146
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,200
what'd ya call it?

147
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
- Amber Alerts.
- Told me no.

148
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,600
Said Marcus probably ran away.

149
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,400
Runaway, banger.

150
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
All code for one thing.

151
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,800
"We don't give a damn."

152
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
Mall security found
my son's jacket

153
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,900
near the food court.

154
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,600
It's his favorite.

155
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,800
Damont had that toy

156
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,500
in his pocket.

157
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,800
Someone give
it to him?

158
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,800
I think he bought it.

159
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:18,900
From one

160
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,300
of the toy stores?

161
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,500
I don't know.

162
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
He was sweet on this girl
at school.

163
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,500
His first crush.

164
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,300
It was probably for her.

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,500
Sounds like a nice kid.

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I told him...

167
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,100
I told him he'd have plenty
of time to worry about girls

168
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,600
when he got older.

169
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,500
Some folks on the block
helped look for Marcus.

170
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,300
Found this in a garbage can.

171
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,000
Marcus had it
with him that day?

172
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,900
Yeah.

173
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,600
Looks like it's been picked
through.

174
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,300
Nothin' much
in it.

175
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Just some magazines,
tickets.

176
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,700
Kids get these at carnivals
or those kiddie pizza places.

177
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,500
No carnivals
in our neighborhood.

178
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,900
And Marcus
would never go

179
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,600
anywhere like that
without tellin' me.

180
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,500
Shemar disappeared
three months ago!

181
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,900
And now you care.

182
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,600
Now you wanna ask me questions
about my grandson.

183
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,200
- Now that he's dead.
- The more information

184
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,700
- we have...
- I came down to Missing Persons

185
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,000
every single day.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,300
And all I got was
some nonsense

187
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,400
about how kids run off

188
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,700
with their friends
to get high.

189
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,300
"Oh, he'll come home,"
they said.

190
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,500
I'm sure that's what they
believed at the time.

191
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,100
If you people

192
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,000
had given a damn

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,600
about just one of those boys
that disappeared,

194
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,400
my grandson
would still be alive.

195
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
Now, wouldn't he?

196
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,600
<i>Yeah,</i>

197
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,400
Theo Gamble.

198
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,000
Rented that unit
in my facility

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
starting back in '03.

200
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
Pretty memorable
this guy?

201
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,800
Paid in cash.

202
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,300
One year up front.

203
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,800
That don't happen
every day.

204
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,900
What'd he look like?

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,100
He was black.

206
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,200
Mid-30s maybe.

207
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Look, I run
the kind of place

208
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,800
where you don't pay too much mind,
you know what I mean?

209
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,000
Was he a big guy?
Average size, what?

210
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,600
Anything'll help.

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,300
All I remember is
he was kinda touched.

212
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,200
As in crazy?

213
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
He got all bent out of shape
over nothing...

214
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,000
Aw, man.

215
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,900
They always lose.

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,600
It's a good thing
I don't gamble, huh?

217
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,500
All right, unit 3079.

218
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,300
It's at the end.

219
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,200
You, you promised me
unit 1925.

220
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,400
They're both the same size.

221
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,600
Who cares about the damn number?

222
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,100
You promised me
that number!

223
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,800
1925.

224
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,200
Take it. It's yours.

225
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,600
Most folks want a unit
that's convenient,

226
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,400
at the end of the row
or something.

227
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,100
But he cared
about the number.

228
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,100
You're damn right he did.

229
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,800
Like I said, touched.

230
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,700
Look, we're going to need you
to talk with a sketch artist.

231
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,200
I told you I didn't see nothing

232
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,300
'cept those ratty gloves.

233
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,400
Rush.

234
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,200
Got a hit on the print
off Shemar's unit.

235
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Whose is it?

236
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,800
Akon Dupree.

237
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,300
Multiple assault
charges.

238
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,700
Weapon of choice:
a knife.

239
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,800
Get down! Get down!

240
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,900
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

241
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,000
What the hell?

242
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,500
What the hell
is this, man?

243
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,900
There a reason
for all the fanfare, dawg?

244
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,300
Four dead kids
reason enough?

245
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,300
I don't know jack
about no dead kids.

246
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,900
Well, we found one in a storage house
not too far from here.

247
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,600
Heard it on the news.

248
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,400
So what? Ain't got
nothin' to do with me.

249
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
I been in rehab.
You can ask 'em yourself.

250
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,000
You might want to explain
what your fingerprint's

251
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,200
doing on that lock.

252
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,700
What? Hold up.

253
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
I went in there to steal stuff.
That's it, all right?

254
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,300
Tell it to your lawyer.

255
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,800
Oh, ease up, dawg.
Maybe we could work out

256
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,100
a trade or something.

257
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,100
Oh, I don't think so, dawg.

258
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,600
Listen, I got this video camera.

259
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,200
I lifted it
from the storage unit last week.

260
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,800
And trust me,

261
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,900
there's something on it
you're gonna want to see.

262
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,100
Explains the tape
on the floor.

263
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,500
He's making the kid
stand there.

264
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
Check out the date stamp.

265
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,700
August 27, 2007.

266
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,600
Four days
after Shemar disappeared.

267
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,600
Fast-forward.

268
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,600
Made them stand there
hours on end.

269
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,100
Explains the
shin splints,

270
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
the bruising.

271
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,000
Same thing happened
to him as a kid?

272
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,400
You know,
he's reliving it maybe?

273
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,700
Making others
go through the pain.

274
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,500
Sick bastard,
do that to some kid.

275
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,400
Made 'em stand
until they couldn't anymore.

276
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,400
Wait.

277
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Take it back.

278
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,200
Think the kid said something.

279
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,700
Defector Three.

280
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,000
Defector Three.

281
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,100
What the hell is Defector Three?

282
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,000
Some kind of code?

283
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,400
Kid hasn't eaten
in four days.

284
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,500
Could be rambling.

285
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,600
Nonsense.

286
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,100
Or a cry for help.

287
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,900
To who?

288
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,700
Only one who's going to see it
is the doer.

289
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,600
Nah, he's at the end
of his rope.

290
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He's desperate.

291
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,000
- Yeah. So?
- Nothin' to lose.

292
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,000
Hoping someone else

293
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,100
gets this tape
besides the doer.

294
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,900
Could be
he's leaving us a message.

295
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,700
You been up all
night with Nick,

296
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,000
trying to figure out the numbers
on the storage units.

297
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,700
Why he's fixated on 'em.

298
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,800
Tried military code,
Morse Code.

299
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,100
No luck.

300
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,300
It can't be the killing

301
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,900
our doer's getting off on.

302
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,100
Yeah? Why's that?

303
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,200
Murder's not on the tape.

304
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,900
It's not what excites him.

305
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,300
The standing does.

306
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,200
Akon's story
checked out.

307
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,500
He was in rehab when two
of the victims disappeared.

308
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,900
Look at his eyes.

309
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
He knows.

310
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Knows what?

311
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,500
He's going
to die alone.

312
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Loneliest thing
in the world, that.

313
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,200
Defector Three.

314
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Figured it out.

315
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,600
It's an
arcade game.

316
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,300
Uh, why did Shemar leave
a message about some game?

317
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,700
That's where
he met his killer.

318
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,100
Toy's made exclusively for
those FunFare Grabber games.

319
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,000
Right.
The game with the big claw thing.

320
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
See 'em at carnivals.

321
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,800
And arcades.

322
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,900
Ditto with the tickets.

323
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,800
There's an arcade
on Shemar's

324
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,000
road home
from school.

325
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,000
Also in the Northland Mall
where Damont disappeared.

326
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
And two blocks
from Marcus's apartment.

327
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,700
All of them

328
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,500
had one of those
Defector Three games.

329
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,400
Arcade. Perfect place
to troll for kids.

330
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,600
Let's canvas 'em.

331
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,200
Station some unis there, too.

332
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,900
Someone might have seen
our doer.

333
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,900
No suspicious dudes
getting past me.

334
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,900
I got zero tolerance
when it comes to safety.

335
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,300
Take it seriously.

336
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,800
Got to. This is
the only place

337
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
where a kid from around here
can be a kid.

338
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,300
You remember seeing
Shemar Reynolds here?

339
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,500
Few months back?

340
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,900
Sure.

341
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,400
High scorer.

342
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,400
Always had an audience, too.

343
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,800
Any of 'em stand out?

344
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,700
New kid.

345
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,000
14, 15 maybe.

346
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,900
Never seen him before.

347
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,900
Watched your boy Shemar
like a hawk.

348
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,700
Right over there.

349
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,600
This kid and Shemar
exchange words?

350
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
You could say that.

351
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,800
He eventually got his nerve up
to play homeboy.

352
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,100
Ah, don't try
that roundhouse kick!

353
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,800
- Yeah, boy!
- Ah!

354
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You got lucky.

355
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,500
Somebody had to fall in the pit.

356
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,900
I'm just glad it wasn't me.

357
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,400
Uh, you talk now, but ain't
nobody ever beat me at home.

358
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,800
Nobody, and
I only play

359
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,000
the best.

360
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,100
Chumps, all of 'em.

361
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,900
Oh, well, let's see
how long you can stand.

362
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,700
What's up?

363
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,600
Let's go.

364
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,300
My grams gets all panicked
when I don't show on time.

365
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,000
It's just a few blocks down.

366
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,600
Uh, if you're scared,

367
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,200
just say so.

368
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,000
You crazy?

369
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Five bucks says you're about
to get another whoopin'.

370
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,300
This kid have a name?

371
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,000
But they both made the board.

372
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
The board? What's that?

373
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,500
High score screen.

374
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,200
Players' names get put on.

375
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,000
The new kid--
he was #2.

376
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
"Theseus."

377
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,000
Never saw Shemar
and that kid again after that.

378
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,600
<i>Checked out all</i>
<i>the Defector Three games</i>

379
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
at the arcades our victims
went missing from.

380
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Name Theseus shows up
on every one of them.

381
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,800
- All our victims played him.
- Yeah.

382
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,200
Kids were pros
at that game.

383
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,500
Nobody topped their scores
for years.

384
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,400
Storage unit was rented
by an adult,

385
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,900
so the kid must be a lure.

386
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,800
Got to admit.

387
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,500
It's smart--
our doer using a kid as bait.

388
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,600
So what's the significance
of this game he plays?

389
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,800
Defector Three?

390
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,500
It was a typical

391
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,700
RPG.

392
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,100
Players force their opponents
into The Pit.

393
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
RPG?

394
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,000
Uh, role-playing game.

395
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
Toni's kid plays 'em.

396
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,400
Nothing special about this one.

397
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,100
Standard fight
to the death stuff.

398
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,500
He's picking that game
for a reason.

399
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,800
If it has a significance,
I'm not seeing it.

400
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,200
The moniker fits, though,
with the lure part, at least.

401
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,000
Well, how so?

402
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600
Looked up the name
Theseus.

403
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,800
It's from Greek
mythology.

404
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,100
Theseus is a young man
who's sent by his father

405
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,900
to do to bad guys
what they did to others.

406
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,500
It's a father
and son thing.

407
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,400
Kid's doing his father's bidding?
Twisted.

408
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,800
Well, some might believe
his dad's righting a wrong.

409
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,300
So the son
finds a victim,

410
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,500
he convinces them
to come and play video games.

411
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,100
Dad takes over from there.

412
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,200
The name Theseus
showed up on a game

413
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,600
in an arcade
in Brewerytown.

414
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,900
There's another victim
out there?

415
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,100
Nope. This opponent's
alive.

416
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,700
Corey Middleton, 11.

417
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,100
Well, bring him in for a talk.
Maybe he can give us an ID.

418
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,900
Any luck with
those storage numbers?

419
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,900
Working on it.

420
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,200
You know,
Toni's kid, Andre,

421
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,400
ain't much older
than these kids.

422
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,600
I used to go to the arcade
when I was little.

423
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,300
You played against
someone named Theseus.

424
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,000
You remember anything
about him?

425
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,100
What he looked like?

426
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,300
He had a PlayStation.

427
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,200
Wanted me to come over
and check it out.

428
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,500
And did you, Corey?

429
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,700
Did you go to his house?

430
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,000
You can tell the truth.

431
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,500
You won't get in trouble.

432
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,200
Is Theseus the guy
that hurt those boys

433
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,900
they're talking about on TV?

434
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,700
We don't know.

435
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,400
That's why we need your help.

436
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,900
I just wanted to play the game.

437
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,100
After this, you
come to my spot,

438
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,100
hit up my PlayStation.

439
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,500
Which games you got?

440
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
All of 'em,
but the dopest

441
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,200
stick to the basics.

442
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,500
- Old school.
- Word.

443
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,000
Just like
when we were little kids, right?

444
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,200
- Look out! Look out!
- About time for your secret sidearm.

445
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,600
How'd you know
about my move?

446
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,800
Been watching you.
Long time.

447
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,400
Watching me play? For real?

448
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,700
Got to.

449
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,100
I don't play
just anybody.

450
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,100
Only those who know
how to dominate.

451
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,300
Wait till you see me
on the PlayStation.

452
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
No, man! Come on.
Get up. Get up. Get up!

453
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,800
No!

454
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,000
I thought you were a winner, man.

455
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,200
I usually am.

456
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,000
Not today you ain't.
You lost.

457
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
You wasted my time.

458
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,100
He got real mad.

459
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,800
Are you sure the kid

460
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,300
you were playing
was wearing ripped gloves?

461
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,100
Yeah.

462
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,800
Like those ones
you use at baseball practice.

463
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,000
Same gloves the guy at
the storage facility described.

464
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,000
The ones the doer was wearing.

465
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,600
He was pretending, though.

466
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
- That guy.
- What do you mean?

467
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,500
Pretending?

468
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,400
He had gray hair on his face
like you.

469
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,800
Gray hair?

470
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,300
Our doer isn't using a kid
as a lure.

471
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,000
Got unis stationed at arcades,
malls, rec centers.

472
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,200
Any place
with video games.

473
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,500
Community knows
we're looking for a guy

474
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,400
that passes himself off
as a kid.

475
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,700
Meaning size ain't
one of his strong points.

476
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,800
That's why he has to lure them
with the video games.

477
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,600
Talk to the families again.

478
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,100
- Ask them if a kid was hanging around the victims.
- Hey, boss.

479
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,600
These families
want answers.

480
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,400
- We keep coming back with more questions.
- Well, we know Theseus

481
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,100
played video games
as a kid.

482
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,900
Yeah, 'cause of that
"when we were little kids" slip

483
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,000
he made with Corey.

484
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,200
Maybe Defector Three
was one of them.

485
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
That game didn't
come out till '99.

486
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,900
Got to be a reason
he chooses kids

487
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,500
- who play that game.
- Not just any kids either.

488
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,800
- Winners.
- It's all about

489
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,300
domination with this guy.

490
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,200
Maybe he's putting them
in their place.

491
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,800
Could be what those
storage units are about.

492
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,800
He's creating his own Pit.

493
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,400
I figured it out.

494
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,700
The numbers on the units.

495
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,800
The numbers he rented,
insisted on...

496
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,200
I'm thinking they had to be
some complicated code.

497
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,800
It isn't.

498
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,700
It's simple arithmetic.

499
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,900
They all add up to 17.

500
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
"Stick to the basics."

501
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,700
Like he told Corey.

502
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,200
He's latching onto these names,
numbers and places

503
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,000
- like he's trying to make sense of something.
- What though?

504
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,800
And what's the significance
of 17?

505
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,100
Theseus is all about
righting the wrongs.

506
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,400
17's probably a place
from his past.

507
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,000
Where things
went bad.

508
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,700
Building, room number,
street address.

509
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
Like I said...

510
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,300
nothing but questions.

511
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,600
<i>You're full of them now.</i>

512
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,500
Shame you wasn't around
when it might've helped.

513
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,900
Ms. Johnson,

514
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,800
did Shemar make any new friends

515
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,300
before he disappeared?

516
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,600
Come to his funeral
and you'll find out.

517
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,000
We need your help to stop

518
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
this guy before
he hurts someone else's son.

519
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,600
Shemar was shy.

520
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,300
Kept to himself.

521
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,400
Been like that
since his mama left.

522
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,600
No friends at all?

523
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,900
Certainly none
that came around here.

524
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,400
What about at the arcade?

525
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,400
Yeah, Shemar met a boy there

526
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,100
a couple of weeks
before he disappeared.

527
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,400
A Theseus, maybe, or Theo?

528
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,500
Yeah, a strange sort of name.

529
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,300
He put all kinds of notions
in my grandson's head.

530
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,800
Forgetting something?

531
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Ma-Two, can I ask yo
a question?

532
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,700
Of course, baby.

533
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,800
What would happen to me
if you died?

534
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,300
You listening to one
of those hippity-dippity

535
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,100
shoot-'em-up songs again?

536
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,000
I told you all that violence
and murder ain't good.

537
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,100
This song ain't like that.

538
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,300
Yeah, sure, it ain't.

539
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,800
It's about the stuff
you talk about.

540
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,100
Like hope,

541
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,600
survival.

542
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You'd like it.

543
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,600
Thinking about your mom?

544
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,300
Nah.

545
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,200
You miss her, don't ya?

546
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
I was only three when she left.

547
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,400
The only one I remember
being there is you.

548
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,800
So why the long face?

549
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,200
This kid I met at the arcade

550
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,500
said that boys with no family like him

551
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,200
get sent to this hard place
that they never get out of ever.

552
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,300
??? It's called "The Pit."

553
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,800
And if you die,
then I'm going to go there, too.

554
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,700
Shemar, baby...

555
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,700
I ain't going nowhere.

556
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,100
But what if you did?

557
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,000
Your mama left,
don't mean I will.

558
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,300
I will always be here
to protect you.

559
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,800
I promise.

560
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,400
Let's say our prayers.

561
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,700
Theseus didn't have a family?

562
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Shemar said
he didn't have nobody.

563
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,400
I didn't keep my promise
to him, now, did I?

564
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,700
You went to the police every day,
asking about Shemar.

565
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,500
You tried.

566
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,200
Shemar started calling me "mama"

567
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,700
after my daughter Belinda left.

568
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,100
You were all he had.

569
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,900
They say, "It takes a village."

570
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,900
But Belinda was always
gonna be Shemar's mama.

571
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,200
I never wanted
to take that from her.

572
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,500
I was just second in line.

573
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,400
That's why he calls you
"Ma-Two."

574
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,400
Thank you for your time,
Ms. Johnson.

575
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,800
Find him.

576
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,900
The man that did this
to those babies.

577
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,900
Make him pay, you hear?

578
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,800
Theseus warned Shemar
about losing family

579
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,300
'cause he didn't have one.

580
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,700
Could've come
from an orphanage,

581
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,700
foster home,
juvenile facility.

582
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,900
A lot of foster care facilities

583
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,000
were breeding grounds
for delinquents.

584
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,400
But there was one in
North Philly, notoriously bad.

585
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,300
It was called Prichard House,
but the residents

586
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,900
had a different
name for it.

587
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,900
The Pit.

588
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,900
That's why Defector Three.

589
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,100
He was stuck in "The Pit" once.
Now, he's killing kids

590
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,000
who were able
to put him there again.

591
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,400
Gets better.

592
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,500
Prichard got written up
for everything

593
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,000
from professional misconduct
to health hazards.

594
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,700
But in '86,
six kids were treated

595
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,500
repeatedly for posterior tibial
syndrome,

596
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,300
also known as shin splints.

597
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,600
Same injuries as our victims.

598
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,700
Patients were treated
by a Dr. Ben Breslyn.

599
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,000
Is he still practicing?

600
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,800
At a clinic in Chestnut Hill.

601
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,700
The Pit, yes.

602
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,200
I treated the kids there

603
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,500
and at seven other facilities
around the city.

604
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,200
Back in '86, six kids came in
with these foot injuries:

605
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,700
bruising, shin splints.

606
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,400
Detective, that was
over 20 years ago.

607
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,400
You don't really expect me
to remember it, do you?

608
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,900
Six kids? 12 visits in two weeks
with the same injuries?

609
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,900
Yeah, I do.

610
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,800
Look, I was fresh
out of medical school

611
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,500
and hell-bent on
making a difference.

612
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,600
Then it would seem like
the kind of thing you'd notice.

613
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,800
You're trained not to.

614
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,900
Just get them in and out
as quickly as possible.

615
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,100
- And I'd been warned.
- About what?

616
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,500
They told us these kids
would do anything for attention.

617
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,900
So you thought
they were faking it?

618
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,600
No one wanted them
and they knew it.

619
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,700
They didn't have anything
to lose by telling

620
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,000
a few tall tales.

621
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,500
Still you didn't think it was ???

622
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,100
I might have if I had more
than five minutes with them.

623
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,400
So you were too busy.

624
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
There was one kid.

625
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,800
Couldn't have been more
than nine or ten,

626
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,900
but that look in his eye.

627
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,500
It always stuck with me.

628
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,400
How'd this happen, Malik?

629
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,700
A lot of you boys coming in
with these same injuries.

630
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,700
You guys goofin' around
jumping off the stairs?

631
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,800
Don't want to tell me?

632
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,300
Fine.

633
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,700
Give this to your counselor.

634
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,100
It'll help the pain.

635
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,900
He made us stand
in the square.

636
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,200
- Like that.
- Who?

637
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,800
Mr. Grimes.

638
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,200
Grimes, the counselor?

639
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Must've been standing there
an awfully long time.

640
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,100
A few days.

641
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,800
Days?

642
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,600
He says when one of us
does something bad,

643
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,500
we all got to pay the price.

644
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,800
Send the next kid in, all right?

645
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,900
Don't forget to give that prescription
to your counselor.

646
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,600
So Grimes was the counselor

647
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,100
to all the boys
with those injuries?

648
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,700
Yes, night counselor.

649
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,300
Former resident, too.

650
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,400
A lot of them came
back to work there.

651
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,500
- Any idea where he is now?
- He left in '91.

652
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,400
Bounced around to a few other
facilities till about '99.

653
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,500
That's the last I heard of him.

654
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,300
'99, that's when
the killing started.

655
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,500
I'm sorry I didn't do more.

656
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,700
Thanks for your time.

657
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,600
Yeah, boss, what is it?

658
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,800
My brother was standing
right here

659
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,900
- the whole time and now he's gone.
- ???

660
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
I'll call your sergeant.

661
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,500
Tyrell Hobbs,
11 years old.

662
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,100
Sister went around
the corner to use the ATM.

663
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,000
When she came back,
Tyrell was gone.

664
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,200
How'd the hell this happen?

665
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,100
We got all the arcades,
everything covered.

666
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,900
Why is he snatching kids
from a pizza joint?

667
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,400
Because we missed
one, Scotty.

668
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
He knows we're onto him.

669
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Must've seen the unis when
he was trolling the arcades.

670
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,900
So he finds the one game
we weren't watching.

671
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,900
- Luck of the devil.
- He knows time's running out.

672
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,300
Probably got a
mission to complete.

673
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,100
-  And he's succeeding.
- Maybe not, boss.

674
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,700
We got a hit
on a storage unit

675
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,600
near the pizzeria
where Tyrell went missing.

676
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,700
Unit numbers adds up to 17.

677
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,700
Guy with ripped gloves

678
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,700
paid cash upfront
a few days ago.

679
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,300
Didn't go by Theo Gamble.

680
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,100
Fits the description
of our doer.

681
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,500
We got to get down there pronto.

682
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Shemar held on for days.

683
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,000
Tyrell may not
have that long.

684
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We got the counselor.

685
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,100
He's in Interview.

686
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,800
No way you're
pinning the murders

687
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,900
of those North Philly
boys on me.

688
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,300
You had a nice long run.

689
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Eight years.

690
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,000
Doesn't take a genius
to beat a murder rap,

691
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,200
if cops aren't looking.

692
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,900
Oh, you think it's funny?

693
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,800
Little boys with their faces
sliced open.

694
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,900
You cops act all concerned now
that you got some bad press.

695
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,900
Need to lock
somebody up quick.

696
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,700
And any old brother will do.

697
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,500
- The jig is up, Grimes.
- You got nothing

698
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,700
connecting me to those murders
and you know it.

699
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,400
We found your storage unit.

700
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,100
We need to open up unit 359 now.

701
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,400
<i>I don't know nothing</i>
<i>about no storage unit.</i>

702
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,800
What about The Pit?

703
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,400
You should know
a lot about that.

704
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,800
The foster care home?

705
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,800
That place
shut down in '95.

706
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,200
That's where you first tried out
your techniques.

707
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,600
Making kids stand
for hours on end

708
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,000
till they couldn't anymore.

709
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,300
Maybe I used some tactics
that weren't popular.

710
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,400
Popular?

711
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,600
That's an understatement,
Grimes.

712
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,900
There were 34
of those Billy Badasses

713
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,200
and only one of me.

714
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,400
I did what I had
to keep them in line.

715
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,500
You hated those boys,
didn't you?

716
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,100
Taught them all
a lesson.

717
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,300
<i>I didn't hate them.</i>

718
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,000
<i>I disciplined them.</i>

719
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Your brand of discipline
was torture.

720
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,100
We talked
to Dr. Breslyn.

721
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,600
He didn't leave me a choice.

722
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,600
Who?

723
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,800
Malik.

724
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,700
I was at my wit's end with him.

725
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,500
He was your first.

726
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,900
I made him stand in the square.

727
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,000
<i>The others, too.</i>

728
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,100
But the runt
just wouldn't learn.

729
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,100
You gotta be real tired
of standing here, huh, Malik?

730
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,400
If you learned to sit still,

731
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,500
you wouldn't be breaking
things all the time.

732
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,100
I told you what I'd do
if it happened again,

733
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,300
didn't I?

734
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,300
Now all the boys
in your ward

735
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,600
have to suffer.

736
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,900
Because when one person
does something wrong,

737
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,600
we all got to pay!

738
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Not you.

739
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,600
Was I talking to you?

740
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,700
Was I talking to you?

741
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,700
Now, if you boys want this
to be your last night

742
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,900
of standing here like this ...

743
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,900
you need to make sure
Malik learns his lesson.

744
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,300
Clear?

745
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,800
Malik learned.

746
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,400
He didn't get
in trouble again.

747
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,900
What did they do
to him?

748
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,300
What did they do to Malik?

749
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,100
They cut off his finger.

750
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,400
The boys in
that bathroom

751
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,100
were different ages,
just like our victims.

752
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,000
How many boys were in there
with Malik?

753
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,500
Five.

754
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,700
Tyrell's the fifth victim.

755
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,200
It's endgame.

756
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,500
What was the room number
on that bathroom?

757
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,800
How you know it had a number?

758
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
What was the number?

759
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,700
17.

760
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,300
Don't come near me.

761
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,300
Hmm.

762
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,800
Drop the guns...

763
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,700
now.

764
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,500
Only if you let Tyrell go.

765
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,000
I know why you're here, Malik.

766
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,200
What happened,
in this room, to you.

767
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,300
I know.

768
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,700
You got no idea about this room.

769
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,100
About me.

770
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,800
Right.

771
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,200
You're just
some psycho

772
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,600
on a power trip.

773
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,000
You ain't better than that.

774
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,300
Oh, you think you know?

775
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,300
A loser...

776
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,400
who takes it out
on little kids,

777
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,700
big man like you.

778
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,400
I am not.

779
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,200
No.

780
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,400
Now you call the shots.

781
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,300
You searched
for those five boys,

782
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
all winners,

783
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,800
who demeaned you for months,

784
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,300
years.

785
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,700
Before, you were powerless
to stop them, but...

786
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,500
not now.

787
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,900
Not ever again.

788
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,500
Everybody stood in the square

789
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,600
because I... said so.

790
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,200
Because you're Theseus.

791
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,800
Righting the wrongs

792
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,800
of things done
to you in here.

793
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,100
I was the smallest,

794
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,500
the weakest,
but they didn't care.

795
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,800
They took everything from you.

796
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,800
And now...

797
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,000
I take everything

798
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,500
from them.

799
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,900
Now if you boys want this

800
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,700
to be the last night
of standing here like this...

801
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,200
you need to make sure
Malik learns his lesson.

802
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Clear?

803
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,000
<i>They were laughing.</i>

804
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,900
<i>Yet Theseus knew</i>
<i>his day would come.</i>

805
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,600
<i>That fed him.</i>

806
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,800
<i>It was his source of strength.</i>

807
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,500
<i>It gave purpose</i>
<i>to his miserable life.</i>

808
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,300
<i>Made him invincible.</i>

809
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,600
<i>Immortal.</i>

810
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,900
<i>God.</i>

811
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,800
<i>He found them, one by one.</i>

812
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,300
<i>And he did exactly</i>
<i>what they had done to him.</i>

813
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,500
Those boys wronged you.

814
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,400
They have to pay.

815
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,700
'Cause you kill
the strong,

816
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,500
the ones that
tormented you

817
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
in this room.

818
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,900
Don't come near me!

819
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,600
You're the strong one,
not him.

820
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,200
Look.

821
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,600
Look, Malik.

822
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,400
Tyrell's just a boy.

823
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,200
Like you were.

824
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
You hear that?

825
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,700
It's over.

826
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,100
Put the knife down, Malik.

827
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,900
Do you know what happened
to Theseus in the end?

828
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,000
Malik... don't!

829
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,600
He rose out of the pit...

830
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,900
a hero.

831
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:51,400
He did what no else could,
and they cheered him on.

832
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,300
Welcomed him...

833
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,300
home.

834
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,100
Put it down.

835
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,800
It's not over.

836
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,900
KJ52: If you're hurtin',

837
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,300
you're strugglin',
feel like you can't make it,

838
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,500
this song's for you, you, you.

839
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:47,300
* <i>Yes, you're gonna make it</i> *

840
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,500
* <i>Don't you worry about a thing</i>
<i>that's happened in your life</i> *

841
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,700
* <i>You're gonna make it</i> *

842
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,000
* <i>Yes, you're gonna make it</i> *

843
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,000
* <i>Don't you worry about a thing,</i>
<i>it's gonna be all right</i> *

844
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,100
* Hey, yo, you may feel like
you're just starting over *

845
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,700
* Mistakes from your past
that just want to hold ya *

846
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,100
* Down to the ground,
it's all on your shoulder *

847
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,700
* You'll never make it now,
that's what they told ya *

848
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,300
* You start to figure out
who really cares for ya *

849
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,700
* When no one's around,
no one is there for ya *

850
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,200
* When I was down and out,
and life was getting colder *

851
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,900
* See I found out
that's when God showed up *

852
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,300
* You try to make it right,
they make it hard for ya *

853
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,900
* But God will take a life
even if it's broke up *

854
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,400
* And give you strength to fight
whatever's coming towards ya *

855
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,900
* And don't forget that I'm
always praying for ya and *

856
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,200
* <i>You're gonna make it</i> *

857
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,000
* <i>Yes, you're gonna make it</i> *

858
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
* <i>Don't you worry about a thing</i>
<i>that's happened in your life</i> *

859
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,200
* <i>You're gonna make it</i> *

860
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,000
* <i>Yes, you're gonna make it</i> *

861
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,900
* <i>Don't you worry about a thing,</i>
<i>it's gonna be all right</i> *

862
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,700
* Hey, yo, it's not fair all the
things that just had to happen *

863
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,100
* Some days you wake up, feel
like you've been abandoned *

864
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,700
* Life didn't shape up
in the way that you planned it *

865
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,800
* The life you live is not
the one that you imagined *

866
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,700
* I know they laugh
and pick on you *

867
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,300
* I know you've had a lot
of junk that you gone through *

868
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,600
* But I know who would never,
ever wrong you *

869
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,500
* Never quit on you
and help you get on through *

870
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,800
* When you fell,
he's the one who caught you *

871
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,600
* With every single tear, man,
see, he saw you *

872
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,000
* He was right there
every time he called you *

873
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,500
* And I'll be praying for you
gonna get on through *

874
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,600
* <i>You're gonna make it</i> *

875
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,500
* <i>Yes, you're gonna make it</i> *

876
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,500
* <i>Don't you worry about a thing</i>
<i>that's happened in your life</i> *

877
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,700
* <i>You're gonna make it</i> *

878
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,500
* <i>Yes, you're gonna make it</i> *

879
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,600
* <i>Don't you worry about a thing,</i>
<i>it's gonna be all right</i> *

880
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,200
* You try to pray,
but you feel too ashamed to *

881
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,800
* 'Cause those around you,
they just wanna blame you *

882
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,300
* But don't listen now
just to what they say, dude *

883
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,700
* God loves you,
he never hates you *

884
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,100
* It's gonna be all right *
* <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i> *

885
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,100
* Don't you worry,
you're gonna make it... *
