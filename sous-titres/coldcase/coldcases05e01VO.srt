1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,000
???

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,400
??

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,100
<i>The daughter survived
a bullet to the head.</i>

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,400
I remember.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,600
Who is he?
You're not gonna
take her from me.???

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,400
Hey!
I'll kill all of you.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,200
(gunshot)
Hey!

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,400
You're coming, too.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,800
<i>RUSH:
I'm going.</i>

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,600
You' die.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,000
Shoot me! Do it now!

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,800
the following story is fictional and does
notdepict any actual person or event

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,100
Pop says we're
not supposed to go

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,700
past Mrs. Mortenson's house.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,100
Who cares what
your pop says?

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,500
No, serious.
He'll blow a gasket

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,600
if we go to
the pool again.

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,700
So what are
we gonna do?

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,900
Hang out here in Snoozerville?

20
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,500
He said a kid

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,400
just got beat up
really bad in Fishtown.

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,000
Jackie's gonngo
wee-wee in his diaper.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,600
Scaredy cat.
Shut up, man.
I ain't scared.

24
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,699
So what are you
waiting for, wusses?

25
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,900
All right.
To the pool.

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,600
Fishtown teenagers
Dylan Noakes and Teddy Nimmo

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
were convicted today
in the brutal deaths

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
of three local fifth-grade boys.

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,200
Nimmo was the only one
to confess to the crime,

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,199
calling it a "thrill kill."

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Look who bothered
coming to work.

32
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,600
Hey.
Hey.

33
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,900
Hey...

34
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,900
You okay?

35
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,200
Oh, yeah, they...
they just took

36
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,600
the stitches out.
Ah.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,400
It's nothing. I'm fine.

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,100
You look good, Lil.
You do.

39
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,300
The city's going
all-out, huh?
Yeah.

40
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,600
Take a bullet, think
they'd give you more

41
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,000
than a Mickey Mouse band-aid.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,800
Didn't stop them from siccing
IAD on our asses.

43
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,800
JEFFRIES:
Protocol--
said he's got

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,500
to dot the "I's,"

45
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,700
cross the "T's,"

46
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,200
prove it was
a good shooting.

47
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,900
So, uh, you ready

48
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,800
to jump back in
the saddle here or what?

49
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,600
VERA:
?? Nervous Nellies.

50
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,200
Need a refill.

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,100
Second that.

52
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,000
Uh, get you anything, Lil?

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,400
No, no, I'm good.
Thanks.

54
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,000
WOMAN:
Are you detectives?

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,100
You need something?

56
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,800
You people killed my son.

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
Teddy.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,400
Teddy Nimmo.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,500
Welcome back, Lil.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,400
I heard about that job.

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,300
Your son and
his buddy

62
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,200
did a triple
back in '93, '94.

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,000
VALENS:
We put him away,

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
lady, we didn't kill him.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,300
Might as well have.

66
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,600
Teddy hung himself.

67
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,700
They gave me his stuff
from the cell.

68
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,300
I found this letter.

69
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,400
"I tape their eyes shut

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
"so they stay in
e dark forever.

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,900
"Just like me.

72
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,600
Stop me. I am the monster."

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,800
Must have been
the real killer

74
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,700
that sent
him that letter

75
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,100
when they first locked him up.

76
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,700
Should've given it
to his lawyer.

77
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,900
Yeah? Teddy tried.

78
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,300
Again and again.

79
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,900
I just talked
to that jackass.

80
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,900
He never listened.

81
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,300
Maybe 'cause your
son wrotit.
Ain't possible.

82
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Believe me.

83
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,100
We're not gonna
just take your word.

84
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,600
My boy, uh, he couldn't write.

85
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
He could
barely read.

86
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
They said he was a monster

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,200
because  was used
to smile at the trial.

88
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,700
That's what Teddy does
when he's scared.

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
He smiles.

90
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
My son, he woul't hurt a soul.

91
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
We'll look into it, Mrs. Nimmo.

92
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,000
No, you won't.

93
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,000
We're just Fishtown
trash, right?

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,400
People like us...

95
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,700
'we don't matter.

96
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,300
???

97
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,700
Cops never released
that detail to the public,

98
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,400
doer taping the dead
kids' eyes shut.

99
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, he had
an accomplice, right?

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,200
Maybe that guy wrote it.

101
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,700
Well, then who mailed it?

102
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,500
Postmark's from Philly.

103
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
His buddy's doing life
up in Graterford.

104
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,200
Could be worth another look.

105
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,000
Could be
a wild-goose chase.

106
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,900
And ito'cled.

107
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,900
Well, if the killer's
still out there...

108
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,200
it's not.

109
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,600
http://www.ragbear.com

110
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,600
VALENS:
The victims were last
seen on their bikes

111
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,200
outside the Raymes
residence.

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,300
Bodies found a day later.

113
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,700
RU:
Ran into the doers
at the abandoned pool.

114
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
Dylan and Teddy's
"hangout."

115
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,100
Our cause of death,
blunt force trauma.

116
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,200
Multiple blows
to the skull, the face.

117
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,900
Murder weapon never found.

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,400
Criminal psychologist
said the scene

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,700
"reflected the frenzied,
explosive rage

120
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,400
of a severely disturbed
and abused child."

121
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,900
Or two of them.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,300
Teddy, raised by a crackhead
single mom.

123
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,300
Dylan, bumped around the foster
care system since age five.

124
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,700
History of abuse,

125
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,500
petty crime,
setting fires.

126
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,000
On the stand, Dylan called
himself a "nihilist."

127
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,700
No beliefs,
no loyalties,

128
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,900
no purpose in life
but destruction.

129
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,100
I didn't know you
worked this job.

130
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,000
No, I didn't.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,600
This kind of massacre,
everyone knew about it,

132
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,400
wanted answers, blood.

133
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,400
Glad to have you back.

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,600
Good to be back, boss.

135
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,600
Start counseling yet?

136
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,400
Not yet. I... will.

137
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,200
Joe Connelly

138
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,400
was the assigned
back in '94.

139
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,800
Thinking we'd have a
talk with Dylan, too.

140
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,400
Teddy confessed.

141
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
witness at the boys'
school overheard them

142
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,200
bragging about the murders,
what's there to talk about?

143
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,500
The letter,
who sent it?

144
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,900
Question Documents has it.

145
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,000
Maybe they give us
some answers.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,800
Joe Connelly was a good cop.

147
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,700
Job's closed.

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,300
You got any open jobs
for me, boss?

149
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,300
Counseling's
not optional here, Rush.

150
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,000
Get that done first.

151
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,900
Yeah.

152
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,000
I will.

153
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,100
Gotta put in
my shrink hours

154
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,900
after that shooting.

155
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
Make sure I'm not nuts.

156
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,200
Gotta be to come back
to this job.

157
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,800
You know, I, um,

158
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,300
I never got
to say, uh,

159
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
thanks.

160
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,300
For what you did.

161
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
I told that
IAD jerk

162
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,100
what a hero you were.

163
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
As long as you don't
make me do it again.

164
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,400
Okay.

165
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,100
Take a ride up to Graterford?

166
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,600
Wasting our time.

167
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,900
Got nothing but, right?

168
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,900
So you coming?

169
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,300
Found this in your, uh,
buddy's belongings, Dylan.

170
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,400
Nice try.

171
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,100
I didn't write that drivel.

172
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,500
Barely looked at it.

173
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,400
Would you prefer

174
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,600
a handwriting sample?

175
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,200
Save us all this
face-to-face?

176
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Heard about what
happened to Teddy yet?

177
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,100
Oh, shocking people...
that get you off?

178
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,900
You sure
you want to know

179
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,400
what gets me off, lady?

180
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,500
We're out.
Forget this ass clown.

181
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Locked in a dark
room for hours,

182
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,700
your letter
writer.

183
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,100
Little boy blue.

184
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,900
Boo-hoo.

185
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,800
You ever locked in
a dark room, Dylan?

186
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,300
I am now.
All those
halfway homes,

187
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,700
mean foster
mommies.

188
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,900
Yomust hate the world.

189
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,800
Killing those boys yr payback?

190
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,700
Sure.

191
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,300
I'm the fire-breathing dragon
from Happily Ever After Land.

192
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,600
Nice tat.

193
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,000
I just got it.

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,100
You want one?

195
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,800
You didn't answer
the question.

196
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,000
You'll believe
what you want.

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,100
The truth's
irrelevant.

198
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,800
Truth being you're a murdering
son of a bitch.

199
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Truth being
we were 17 and stupid.

200
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,500
We still believed.

201
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,800
Believed what?
That they wouldn't

202
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,400
put you away for a crime
you didn't commit.

203
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,300
Here they come.
Here they ar

204
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,500
How could they
give us life, Dyl?

205
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,800
We didn't do anything.

206
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,900
Where's my mom?

207
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,600
Mom?
(clamoring)

208
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,700
Mom?

209
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,900
MAN:
You let my son die!

210
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,000
I hope they kill
you in prison!
Jack!

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,700
WOMAN:
I want my son back!

212
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,400
Let's give them
what they want then.

213
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,400
Land of the free,
home of the brave.

214
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,400
Guilty for...
being a freak.

215
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,000
Welcome to the U.S. of A.

216
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,200
You're breaking me
up here, homes.

217
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,900
<i>Stay a little
longer, guapo.</i>

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,500
I'll break you in for real.

219
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
You promise?

220
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,700
I'm done here.

221
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,700
Attitude like that
helped put you here
in the first place.

222
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,300
Being poor is
what put us away.

223
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,900
Not to mention
your buddy's confession.

224
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,300
He was a kid, okay?
Mama's boy.

225
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,600
No match
for that cop.

226
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,200
<i>You saying Connelly
forced Teddy to lie?</i>

227
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,000
Cop forcing a false confesssion?

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No... that never happens.

229
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
MAN:
That letter is pure B.S.

230
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,100
Dylan's a con artist.

231
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,100
imo sociopath.

232
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,900
Got a IQ of 190.

233
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,900
He's playing you.

234
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,600
JEFFRIES:
Well, maybe he is.

235
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,600
Just doing due diligence, Joe.

236
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,500
You saying I blew the job?

237
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
I'm just saying
I'm doing mine.

238
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,400
CONNELLY:
Takes a while, beating
a person to death.

239
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,900
VERA:
The kind of job
that gets to you.

240
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,700
Cost me my marriage.

241
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,600
I hear that.

242
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,600
We searched all night,
and then I found them.

243
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,300
It rained the night before
they were killed.

244
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,900
??  Pool sck
with mud...

245
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,300
Think of anything else,
you know where to find us.

246
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,000
Appreciate your time, Joe.

247
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,000
The night I go to arrest
that punk, Dylan,

248
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,000
you know
what he says?

249
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,000
What's that?

250
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,400
"Think I'll be on
the news tonight?"

251
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,800
Now you tell me
they didn't do it.

252
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,700
The guy did his job.

253
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,800
What the hell
are we doing?

254
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,300
Spinning our wheels.

255
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,500
RUSH:
Dylan's handwriting

256
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,100
wasn't a match to the letter.

257
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,900
Ain't what you
call exact science.

258
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,100
Could have faked it.

259
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,400
Could've got some

260
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,800
prison groupie to write it.

261
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,900
The kid's a genius, right?

262
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,800
No forensics

263
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
connecting him to that
kind of crime scene?

264
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,900
Come on. And what happened
to the murder weapon?

265
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,900
They dumped it.

266
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,600
Bodies were left where
they're sure to be found,

267
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
sure to be connected
to Dylan and Teddy,

268
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,400
so why hide
the weapon?

269
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,800
You're reaching, Lil.

270
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,100
And you're reaching
for my kung pao chicken.

271
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,700
It's family style. So what?

272
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,100
Do I look like your family?

273
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,700
Connelly said there was a storm
the night before the murders.

274
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,900
Mud all over the scene, right?

275
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,600
VERA:
Yeah, so what?

276
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,500
And the kids supposedly rode
their bikes to the pool.

277
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,500
So why no mud
in their wheels?

278
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,300
MILLER:
Squeaky clean,
every one of them.

279
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,400
When Connelly was tracking mud
all over the damn place.

280
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Pool wasn't the death scene,
just the dump site.

281
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,200
Somebody carried the boys the,
and their bikes.

282
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,500
??

283
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,400
Thought I told you
this job was closed.

284
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,500
RUSH:
Well, the kids weren't
murdered at the pool.

285
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,200
So?

286
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,900
How'd Dylan and Teddy
tranort the bodies?

287
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,000
Didn't own a car,
didn't even have licenses.

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,600
They could've stolen
a car to get them.

289
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,400
No vehicle thefts reported
in the vicinity of the pool.

290
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,800
Well, could've carried
them there at night.

291
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
No one would have
seen them.

292
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,400
Okay, sure, so why
go to all that trouble

293
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,000
of putting bodiein the one
spot connected to you?

294
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,900
You're saying
the dump site
was a setup?

295
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,800
Well, bodies were supposed
to be found,

296
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,800
pinned on the bad kids
who hung there 24/7.

297
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,100
So where were
they killed?

298
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,900
That's what we got
to find out.

299
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,700
You talk to any
of the parents yet?

300
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,100
Probably knew
their kids' haunts.

301
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,700
Sean's folks left
the state years ago.

302
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Moved to Oregon.

303
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,500
We reached out
to George's family.

304
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,300
Got shut down.

305
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,100
That's understandable.

306
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,800
Job's closed.

307
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,400
Why dig up the worst
memory of your life?

308
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,200
Jack's parents are
still in Fairmont.

309
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,600
His mom was the last to see.

310
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,500
Jeffries and Miller
are having a talk.

311
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,200
All right, Scotty, you're
the assigned on this one.

312
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, sure.

313
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,600
ut those
monsters awa

314
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,800
and you want
to let them go.

315
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,100
That's not what we're
doing, Mr. Raymes.

316
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,400
We wanted to ask
about some other places

317
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
Jack and his friends
might have played.

318
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:25,800
Why?

319
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,000
We think your so
and his friends

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,500
were killed elsewhere,
moved to the pool.

321
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,600
Moved?

322
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,400
Oh, my God.

323
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,000
Is this really necessary?

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,400
We just barely got
our lives back together.

325
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,100
I'm not really sure
that my wife can go
through this again.

326
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,600
I've noticed a lot of empty
factories in the neighborhood.

327
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
Did any of the boys
play there?

328
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
No. I told Jack

329
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,200
to stay away from those places.

330
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,600
Boys will be boys.

331
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,800
Not Jack, he was a good kid.

332
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,500
He always minded

333
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,200
his mom and me, and he
would never've done

334
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,700
anything without telling us.

335
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,300
Got anything to add,
Mrs. Raymes?

336
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
I should have stopped him
from going?

337
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,700
JEFFRIES:
Going where?

338
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
Off the block that day.

339
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,300
JACK:
To the pool!

340
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,600
Jack, where do you think
you're going?

341
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Nowhere.

342
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,300
Get over here,
mister.

343
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,400
I'm working
the late shift tonight,

344
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,000
so the last thing I need
is you running all over town.

345
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,600
Oh, Jack, not again
with the wipeouts.

346
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,900
Taking that bike away if
you can't be more careful.

347
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,200
I am careful, Mom.

348
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,800
You've been to that
pool again, haven't you?

349
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,000
We can do wheelies
and cool stuff there.

350
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,900
And Sean and George
will go home if we have

351
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,500
to say in Snoozerville.

352
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,900
And I'll be all alone!

353
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Look, you can go past
Mrs. Mortensen's

354
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,700
if you promise
to stay away from the pool.

355
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,100
Really, Mom?
Go on,

356
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,200
get out of here before
I change my mind.

357
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,100
You might want to zip up

358
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,500
your backpack
before your buddies

359
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,900
see Lil' Duke.

360
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,900
Why are you carrying
him around anyway?

361
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,900
'Cause Lil' Duke keeps
the dragon away.

362
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,100
The dragon?

363
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,900
I thought he'd be safe.

364
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,800
I never should have
let him off the block.

365
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,900
Jack mentioned something
about a dragon?

366
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,700
I didn't think
anything of it.

367
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,400
Kids' imaginations
and all.

368
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,900
Jack had that
stuffed imal

369
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,200
the day he died?

370
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Police said they never found it.

371
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,100
Maybe you will?
It was his
favorite toy

372
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,200
when he was a little kid.

373
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,000
He slept with it curled
up in a little ball.

374
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,500
He said it, uh, "kept
the monsters away."

375
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,000
I mean, not that
he'd ever admit it.

376
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,800
He was just a
little boy, okay?

377
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
<i>He was the victim.</i>

378
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,100
Not them.

379
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,500
The dron.

380
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,700
Those boys were
scared of you.

381
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,900
Do you mind?

382
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,400
This ball and chain kind
of makes it hard to converse.

383
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,600
You push them off their
bikes at the pool?

384
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,100
Bruise them?

385
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,400
I scared them.

386
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,400
I never touched them.

387
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,300
Never came up
in the first investigation,

388
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,100
you bullying them.
If I had told,
it'd give

389
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,900
Connelly more rope
to hang me with.

390
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,400
You know tha

391
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,700
??? stuffed toy after you
killed him, Dylan?

392
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,000
?? Three little boys died.

393
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,600
Someone's got to pay.

394
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,900
Like the trash from the wrong
side of the tracks.

395
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,700
So, the whole neighborhood lies?

396
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Just the ones
that matter.

397
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,800
The cop,
the wannabe cheerleader.

398
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,400
The star witness who heard you
take credit for the murders?

399
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,900
Come on.

400
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,200
Oh, u mean
the attention whore?

401
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
Year before the trial,
she's running around school

402
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,100
saying that she's got
terminal cancer, right?

403
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,000
And your lawyer
never brought this up?

404
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,400
I guess it slipped his mind.

405
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,600
'Cause you'reothing but trash.

406
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,400
Did you kill
those boys, Dylan?

407
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,500
"Evil Triumphs."

408
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,600
You wrote that.

409
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
"When good men do nothing."

410
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,000
That's the quote.

411
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,500
"Evil triumphs

412
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,100
when good men do nothing."

413
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,500
Edmund Burke.

414
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,400
Guess you're
not familiar.

415
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,400
We'll check out
that witness.

416
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,900
But if this is
some kind of con...

417
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,600
Spent half my life in here.

418
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,800
I'm probably gonna die
in here, too.

419
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,700
I'm all out of cons.

420
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,300
I didn't kill those boys.

421
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,770
In court,you testified Dylan said,quote,

422
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,150
"We killed those brats,

423
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,180
bashed their heads in. It was fun"

424
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,570
That was a long time ago.

425
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,330
Why does it matter now

426
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,990
He said you made it up.

427
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,820
And you believe that weirdo?

428
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,920
I found this in the court records,too.

429
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,530
Restraining order you filed against your homeroom teacher.

430
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,710
Claimed he was stalking you.

431
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,380
What is this? Stalking,

432
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,400
cancer... I mean, lp me out here,Heidi,

433
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,920
'cause from where I'm sitting

434
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,950
you got a real problem with fact and fiction.

435
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,400
Everyone said they did it, even our pncipal.

436
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,800
Oh,so they must've,right?

437
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,660
Dylan and Teddy poured pig's blood

438
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,900
in assembly to protest

439
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,230
the Rwandan genocide or whatever it was called,okay?

440
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,210
They were freaks.

441
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,880
("Drain You" by Nirvana playing) Guess what I heard?

442
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,290
When they found those little boys,

443
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,190
their heads were like smushed pumpkins.

444
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,470
Oh,my God,freak alert,12:00.

445
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,430
I thought you'd be dead

446
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,230
from cancer by now,Heidi.

447
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,690
Um,do I even know you?

448
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,960
From second grade, remember?

449
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,260
I popped you under the jungle gym.

450
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,120
<i>I bet you killed those kids.</i>

451
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,610
Maybe we bash your head in,bitch.

452
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,800
So,Dylan never actually said,

453
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,380
"We killed those brats,

454
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,750
bashed their heads in"?

455
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,620
Teddy confessed to that cop,right?

456
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,390
What else do you want?

457
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,930
Homegirl basically made it up.

458
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,240
No one questioned her story.

459
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,150
Someone had to pay.

460
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,180
Why not the Fishtown freaks?

461
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,320
House of cards coming down.

462
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,350
We go back to Connelly? And say what

463
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,590
That your case sucked?

464
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,390
How about "it's looking like a cover-up"?

465
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,320
Checked out abandoned factories in Fairmont.

466
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,170
Complaint came in the night of the murders.

467
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,730
Six-foot-five homeless man,

468
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,000
Caucasian,spotted in empty lot

469
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,070
at the corner of Fifth and Allen.

470
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,130
That's five blocks from the pool.

471
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,060
And get this:

472
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,810
the guy was agitated, freaked out,

473
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:03,920
and covered in blood.

474
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,030
Unis pick him up?

475
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,890
No,complaint gets lost in the system.

476
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,760
By the time it surfaces the next morning,

477
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,750
our homeless man's long gone.

478
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,460
Unbelievable. Gets better.

479
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,790
Questioned Documents found what looks like a partial number

480
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,060
in the upp right hand corner.

481
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,690
Same kind of number evidence control uses

482
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,620
in our investigations.

483
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,890
You're saying the letter was mailed to Teddy

484
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,390
from inside homicide?

485
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,410
????

486
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,580
Vera's canvassing shelters, soup kitchens in the area

487
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,390
for a six-foot-five male.

488
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,110
Needle in a haystack.

489
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,440
Worth checking with the cops on homeless shuttle,

490
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,490
see if they picked up

491
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,980
any Jolly Green Giants on their sweeps.

492
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,520
What about the letter?

493
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,140
Well,evidence custodian back in '94 was a uni

494
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,620
name of Jade Diaz.

495
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,840
Only one who could've signed it out.

496
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,800
Funny thing is,she transferred out of evidence control

497
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,420
two weeks before the trial.

498
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,820
You having a talk?

499
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,170
Miller is.

500
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,770
You realize this is a cop's career?

501
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,410
A cover-up,too.

502
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,600
Maybe.

503
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,480
That's a big maybe.

504
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,520
Step lightly.

505
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,580
Always do,boss.

506
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,700
You don't think she's ready to be back.

507
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,200
Doer had to write it.

508
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,390
Public never knew he taped up their eyes.

509
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,640
Seen lots of evidence over the years.

510
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,440
I don't recall that letter.

511
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,820
Sorry.

512
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,730
Oh.

513
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,300
Well,according to your log,

514
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,740
letter came in after Teddy's confession.

515
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,000
Connelly must've seen it.

516
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,310
But he had his doers, so he buries it.

517
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,660
I'm due at roll call in 20. Want to speed this up?

518
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,430
But you know

519
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,360
the letter exists

520
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,020
and you got access.

521
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,110
So you mailed it to Teddy.

522
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,870
You like being a cop?

523
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,630
The job?

524
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:00,850
Yeah.

525
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,610
Me,too.

526
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,270
Teddy hung himself.

527
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,340
Two days ago.

528
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,270
Oh... I thought you knew.

529
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,970
Just turned 30 years old.

530
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,740
What a waste.

531
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,950
Wonder how he felt... when he got that letter?

532
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,590
Knowing you believed in him.

533
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,320
Only one in the world who did.

534
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,910
Connelly interviewed the kid.

535
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,370
Twelve hours

536
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,700
Had me set up the tape for the confession.

537
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,980
Tape?

538
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,840
There was never a taped confession at the trial.

539
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,520
You don't say.

540
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,160
We know about the ta, Connelly.

541
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,230
One that never made it to court.

542
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,310
Don't you have open jobs to work?

543
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,480
Bad guys to catch?

544
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,220
Six-foot-five homeless guy,bloody,

545
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,200
agitated,five blocks from the pool.

546
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,200
He b enough for you?

547
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,390
You saying I'm out of line?

548
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,330
Pot calling the kettle black,bro.

549
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,840
Excuse me?

550
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,790
IAD's got it hard for you,

551
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,100
and everyone knows it.

552
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,920
That was a good shooting... bro.

553
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,820
Someone's gonna take a fall.

554
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,630
And from what I hear...

555
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,750
you're their butt boy.

556
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,920
Oh,yeah? l right, talk about the tape.

557
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,580
You got no idea the kind of pressure we were under.

558
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,240
Kid killers out there... must've been tough.

559
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,220
They did it,

560
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,780
but the little bastards won't own up.

561
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,680
So what do you do? Let them walk?

562
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,260
RUSH: Not a chance.

563
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,840
So you brought in Teddy, the weak one.

564
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,100
Crying about how he's innocent,

565
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,670
how he wants his rights.

566
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,850
Where were those dead kids' rights

567
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,060
when they were being aten to death?

568
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,300
They didn't have any rights.

569
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,680
I already told you, we didn't do nothing.

570
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,030
You saw those kids at the pool, though,didn't you?

571
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,880
No. Not that day,we didn't.

572
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,140
And you got mad at them 'cause they called you freaks,

573
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:31,930
weirdoes. (laughs)

574
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,330
Didn't they? No. Just you do that.

575
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,670
You hit them over and over

576
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,560
till they stopped moving.

577
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,010
Just say it,

578
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,770
and you can go home.

579
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,230
And this nightmare is over.

580
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,860
Don't you want to go home,Teddy?

581
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,700
(crying): Yeah.

582
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,970
Then just say it.

583
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,660
We saw them at the pool.

584
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,300
Then what happened?

585
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,630
We stabbed them.

586
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,160
You hit them, you mean,right?

587
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,220
Thrill kill.

588
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,300
Yeah... okay.

589
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,690
We hit them.

590
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:48,050
Over and over until they stopped moving.

591
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:52,050
I want my mom.

592
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,880
I want to go home.

593
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:03,130
You got no right to judge me.

594
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,040
Those boys did it.

595
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,060
You sure about that... Connelly?

596
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,220
Absolutely.

597
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,710
Then why'd you bury the tape?

598
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,020
<i>VERA: My snitch swears</i>

599
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,960
he saw Big Foot here a couple hours ago.

600
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:26,550
Your snitch's a money- grubbing pain in the ass.

601
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:32,240
<i>Yo! You seen a six-foot-five homeless guy here,mamacitas?</i>

602
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,840
I can just take you in for loitering.

603
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,490
Been to every shelter, soup kitchen in the city.

604
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,440
We're not gonna find him.

605
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,160
Well,it's time to shut down Hooker Mart.

606
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,330
No pay or play till you give me Sasquatch,ladies.

607
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,790
JEFFRIES (chuckling): It's a fool's errand.

608
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,520
They're not gonna talk to you.

609
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,580
Look...

610
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,240
you fly,I'll buy.

611
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,940
Get me a couple of cold ones.

612
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,060
You want to find someone?

613
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,400
All you had to do was ask the right way,

614
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,000
big boy.

615
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,950
Where'd you get the dog, big man?

616
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
We found it in your cart.

617
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,270
From the Devil.

618
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,430
You mean from the little boy,in the pool.

619
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,840
How'd you know about that?

620
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,850
'Cause he's God,jackass.

621
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,970
That's right.

622
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,350
I see everything.

623
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,590
I saw what you did to those little boys.

624
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,960
I didn't mean to. Prove it.

625
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,570
Tell me what happened.

626
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,340
It was him...

627
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,630
the Devil.

628
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,150
He made me do it.

629
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,320
All the evil in the world in those eyes.

630
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,520
He ran...

631
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,420
he dropped it.

632
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,740
I took it... to show the world...

633
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,840
what he did to those children.

634
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,680
Looks like we got played.

635
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,830
By the Devil himself.

636
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,720
Put his cuffs on.

637
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,090
DYLAN: What? Do it.

638
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,690
(gans) You're pretty good.

639
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,310
You had me going there. This how you get your kicks?

640
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,610
Hey,I didn't lie to you...

641
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,860
You were at the pool, standing over the bodies.

642
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,470
We got a witness.

643
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,570
You wouldn't understand.

644
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,780
You're right. I got no idea what it's like

645
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,670
to look into three little kids' eyes and beat them to death.

646
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,710
Yeah,well,neither do I...

647
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,010
You were standing over their bodies!

648
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,470
You were holding Jack's bloody t in your hand!

649
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,660
You want to believe I did it?! Then fine!

650
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,510
Okay,I did it! I killed them!

651
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,480
You're a monster...

652
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,310
You've got no idea what that means.

653
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,570
Why'd you tape their eyes shut?

654
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,480
I thought I knew

655
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,150
how cruel and ugly the world was.

656
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,760
I was wrong.

657
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,740
They were just kids.

658
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,410
You know?

659
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,710
We all were.

660
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,430
Sometimes I dream that,um...

661
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,940
they're still alive.

662
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,460
And we all get to start over again.

663
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:34,610
You saw Jack curled up with that stuffed dog?

664
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,590
Are you sure?

665
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,520
Like he was asleep.

666
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,740
It was keeping him safe.

667
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,560
Stooping pretty low bringing me in like this.

668
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,110
Well,found your son's stuffed dog,Henry.

669
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,150
Lil' Duke.

670
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,420
It was left with him.

671
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,150
Your son was,uh,

672
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,800
afraid at nights.

673
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,760
And your wife worked the graveyard shift.

674
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,180
What's your point?

675
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,920
Leaving him home alone with you.

676
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,840
Night he died.

677
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,330
You people are unbelievable.

678
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,580
Those bruises Jack had.

679
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,150
Dylan didn't give them to him,did he?

680
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,830
I loved him.

681
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,910
Ask anyone-- ask my wife.

682
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,500
She's here.

683
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,290
Look...

684
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,430
you got the animals who murdered my child.

685
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,340
Now,why don't you

686
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,850
just leave well enough alone?

687
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,570
Doesn't work like that.

688
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,100
Hey,got to step out.

689
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,690
Why are you doing this to us?

690
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,460
I think you know why,Tanya.

691
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,540
We lost our son.

692
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,010
We're the victims here.

693
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,870
You have no right.

694
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,850
(chuckles lightly) What's it like?

695
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,980
Cooking his meals, sleeping in the same bed,

696
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,750
making love...

697
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,760
with the man who killed your child?

698
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,890
How dare you?

699
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,570
My husband is a good man, decent,

700
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,600
kind.

701
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:51,070
It's so much easier to believe monsters do these things...

702
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,530
not men.

703
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,590
I don't have to listen

704
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,280
to this garbage.

705
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:58,160
We found Jack's stuffed imal.

706
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,420
Lil' Duke.

707
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,670
It was in the pool.

708
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,950
He was holding it,

709
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,680
just like he did at night when he was sleeping.

710
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,240
I... I don't understand.

711
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,180
Whoever hurt him

712
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:16,460
loved him,too.

713
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,860
I have to find my husband.

714
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:25,890
If Jack was alive today... he'd be 24.

715
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,820
A man.

716
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,430
Able to protect himself.

717
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,150
But he couldn't back then.

718
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,520
He was just a little boy.

719
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,700
Please,stop this.

720
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,730
But you can protect him,Tanya.

721
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,360
(retching) You can help him now.

722
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,200
What'd you see,Tanya?

723
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,310
(weakly): I don't know what I saw.

724
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,870
You tried to forget,

725
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,750
but you can't.

726
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:58,770
It was the day we buried our son...

727
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,960
that I saw...

728
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,220
Honey.

729
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,240
You found that.

730
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,980
I've been looking everywhere for that thing.

731
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,760
You must have dropped it.

732
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,910
I miss him,honey.

733
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,970
I miss him,too.

734
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,530
He has flashlights in every room,you see.

735
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,750
Why?

736
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:19,370
Henry's always been terrified of the dark.

737
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,570
He sleeps with the lights on.

738
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,960
<i>STILLMAN: You wanted to get caught.</i>

739
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,510
You were screaming to get caught.

740
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,580
But no one listened.

741
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,540
They already had Dylan and Teddy,the perfect scapegoats.

742
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,090
But what gets you in the end is the people you love.

743
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:37,420
Like what happened to you as a boy.

744
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,000
I'm not following.

745
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,610
Who locked you in a...

746
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,080
dark room,Henry?

747
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,200
Your wife isn't protecting you anymore.

748
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,320
Enough with the act.

749
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,720
I want a lawyer.

750
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,610
I'm not talking to you.

751
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,910
Fine.

752
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:10,080
Maybe you should spend some time alone then.

753
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,720
In the dark.

754
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,170
No.

755
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,890
locIf youk me

756
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,310
in here,I'll kill you!

757
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,780
I will kill you!

758
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,890
You hear me?!

759
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,930
Sit down,Henry.

760
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,450
Sit down.

761
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,940
Don't leave me in here.

762
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,010
Please,

763
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,700
don't leave me in here.

764
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,820
STILLMAN: You promised yourself

765
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,470
you would never let it happen again.

766
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,340
No one would ever put you in the dark.

767
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,850
Or they would pay.

768
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,260
And that's why you taped their eyes shut.

769
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,570
Make them pay forever.

770
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,630
He was...

771
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,150
he was a bad boy,that Jack.

772
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,180
Sneang o

773
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,820
So many...

774
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,810
so many

775
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,710
dirty d things in the dark... waiting for you.

776
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,000
I told him to play inside with the others.

777
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,290
Where it was safe.

778
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,250
(sobbing): Nowhere is safe.

779
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:29,500
It's darkness everywhere.

780
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,190
Inside the house, inside the basement.

781
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,270
de..Insi

782
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,960
inside of me.

783
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,880
<i>Jack!</i>

784
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:44,970
How many times I got to tell you to put those damn bikes away?

785
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,640
hi (wmpering): Don't.

786
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,230
No.

787
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,630
Please,Daddy.

788
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,420
Don't leave mee.

789
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,940
No,not the dark!

790
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,890
(childre) atPlngease 't!

791
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,700
He needs some help.

792
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,200
(mockingly): Daddy.

793
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,800
What a weirdo.

794
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,280
Daddy?

795
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:51,960
