2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,500
how much is that doggie in the window? 

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,400
Arf, arf!

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,600
The one with the waggly tail 

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,600
how much is that doggie in the window...? 

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,600
Dimples and cherry cheeks,

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,100
cherry cheeks, cherry cheeks 

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,500
get behind my counter
and sell some makeup, honey.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,200
At ease, soldier.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,600
How'd it go in there, son?

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,300
Great. We made our own record.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,000
When she's ready, 
pop her on the jukebox.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,100
I know your mom will want to hear it.

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,100
Will do, dad.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,400
... Captured by the sweetest angel face 

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,400
with dimples and cherry cheeks, cherry cheeks... 

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,900
baby, why are you so secretive 
about your songs?

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,200
'Cause what if you don't like 'em?

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,300
Impossible.

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,900
you all done there, sugar?

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,500
Looks like I am, lemon drop.

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,400
You're such a spaz!

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,600
All right, luke.

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Cut it out.

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,400
Face it, jp: 
Your cousin's a fream.

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,800
So is his outcast fream girlfriend.

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,100
Stick it up your wazoo,

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,300
frankenstein.

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,100
Wow, 

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,300
classy lady, bingo.

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,100
They can drop dead twice, bingo, 

32
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,600
'cause you're my star, 
and all we need is love.

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,000
And music.

34
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,500
never got a chance to ask.

35
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,700
How did round two go with iad?

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,900
Don't know. 

37
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,200
Bad.

38
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,600
So what happened?

39
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,200
Someone snitched about burrell.

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,300
You're kidding me.
Who?

41
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,800
Could have been anyone who knew.

42
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,800
Scotty, come on.
You don't think it was one of us?

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Pick a stick.

44
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,600
What's it today?

45
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,900
Crackpot in the witness room.

46
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,400
Says he saw a murder 54 years ago.

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,700
Drawing straws.

48
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,500
How about we just do our job?

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What's with him?

50
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,600
You saying you witnessed a murder?

51
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,300
Kinda. I mean,

52
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,300
Sorta.

53
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,500
Which is it, lloyd?

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,100
I saw blood...

55
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,200
lots of it 
back in 1953.

56
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
Blood isn't a murder.

57
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,000
I know what I saw.

58
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,700
You going to write this down or what?

59
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,700
Go on.

60
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,000
Late one night,

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
my parents are throwing pans at each other.

62
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,700
I snuck out to practice pop flies.

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,200
My ball gets away from me,

64
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,700
so I chase it down the alley
behind valentine's five and dime.

65
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,900
The wallet belonged to bingo zohar.

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,300
I heard my parents talking a few days later 
about him being shot behind some... 

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,600
... blues club in point breeze.

68
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,300
And where was this five-and-dime
you found the wallet at?

69
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,900
Germantown.
My old neighborhood.

70
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,400
That's clear across philly 
from point breeze.

71
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,900
It was all white in '53.

72
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,700
That'S... what I'm saying.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,700
You never told your parents
what you saw?

74
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,100
Shouldn't have been out,
you know?

75
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,900
Then... just got easier not to believe my eyes,

76
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,800
pretend it was A... 

77
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,500
... dream or something.

78
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,900
Sounds like this memory ain't exactly crystal.

79
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,300
Yeah, well, maybe, uh...

80
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,700
this will help.

81
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,000
Hung onto it...

82
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,500
54 years.

83
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,000
Why come forward now?

84
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,500
My eyes.

85
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,200
I'm losing 'em.

86
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,900
Doc says a few more years 
I'll be blind.

87
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,500
Guess I thought I tell what I saw might...

88
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,800
set things right.

89
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,900
Can't fix your eyes, but...

90
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,100
we'll try to set things right.

93
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,300
Bingo zohar, 19 years old.

94
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,000
Shot and killed behind red hot mama's blues club,

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
corner of 20th and south.

96
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,500
Rounded up the usual suspects-- 
all black.

97
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,000
Never could pin it on anyone.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,900
Cops never found the bullet 
that cleared bingo's chest.

99
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,200
Makes sense if it's only the dump site.

100
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,700
Strange substance on bingo's sleeve.

101
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,700
Cops back then couldn't id it.

102
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,300
If he was murdered in the five-and-dime...

103
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,500
changes the suspect list.

104
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,700
He'd recently moved from brandywine-- 
old farm town.

105
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,000
Parents died in a car accident.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,200
He was living with the valentine family.

107
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,200
Uncle ed...

108
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,000
aunt julianna,

109
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,600
cousin jp.

110
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,900
Who's the girl?

111
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,900
Girlfriend.

112
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,700
Uh... miranda allison.

113
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,900
Recording booth behind the family.

114
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,300
Typical of the old five-and-dimes.

115
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,800
Doer dumping the body on the other side of town

116
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,600
gets the spotlight off himself.

117
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Maybe he did it on the way home.

118
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,700
Arthur brown, aka "aces,"

119
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,400
worked the night shift with bingo 
at the five-and-dime.

120
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,700
Oh, lived at 22nd and south.

121
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,300
Two blocks from the dump site.

122
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
If we're lucky, 
evidence still has bingo's shirt.

123
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,900
Send it to the lab, 
maybe they can id that substance.

124
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,400
Meanwhile, have a talk with aces?

125
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,200
Let's have a look around the old five-and-dime,

126
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
see if we can't find that bullet.

127
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
you're kidding, right?

128
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,000
Afraid not.

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,800
It's been 27 years since this holistic health store 
was valentine's five and dime.

130
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,000
That so?

131
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,000
Kind of out of the realm of possibility 
that you'll find some 50-year-old bullet.

132
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,200
Could have got lodged in a wall or a floorboard?

133
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,500
So what...

134
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,900
you think you're digging up my floors or walls?

135
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,900
It's not out of the realm of possibility.

136
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,800
These are fresh walls.

137
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,500
I just had them painted.

138
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,400
And my floors are malaysian bamboo.

139
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,000
So maybe you should look somewhere else 
for your phantom bullet.

140
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,400
Did you find anything during that remodel?

141
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Like a bullet?

142
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,500
Uh... 

143
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,200
no.

144
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,800
'Cause if I find out you tampered with evidence,

145
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,100
I'll stick you in the slammer with guys 
who ain't familiar with buddhist teachings.

146
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,200
You do, 

147
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,000
and karma will be all over your ass, pal.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,200
Oh, I'll be all over your ass, pal...

149
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,800
with a warrant.

150
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,900
Goji berry? 

151
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,200
They make you happy.

152
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,600
You eat enough,

153
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,500
you never stop smiling.

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,500
This place looks great.

155
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,100
Just like the stories I used to hear growing up.

156
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,300
Yeah, people tend to embellish the past.

157
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,300
Red hot mama's was a dive, 
but a fun one.

158
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,200
When I came into some money,

159
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,200
I decided to make reopening it my pet project.

160
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,300
Well, there's a blues resurgence--

161
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,400
kids hearing it for the first time.

162
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,100
You wouldn't believe what these kids 
will pay for a drink.

163
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,200
Six dollars.

164
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,100
Nine.

165
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,500
Bingo zohar?

166
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,700
You know him or what?

167
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,000
I remember bingo.

168
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,300
Cat was one of a kind.

169
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,400
Shot down back of this alley.

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,600
See, we think he was killed 
at valentine's five and dime,

171
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
where you two worked the night shift together.

172
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,700
I wasn't working that night with bingo,

173
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,300
if that's what you're implying.

174
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,700
I ain't implying it.

175
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,700
I'm saying it.

176
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,400
I quit valentine's the week before.

177
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Got tired of cleaning up after white folk,

178
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,800
getting treated like dirt.

179
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,200
Bingo treat you that way, too?

180
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,300
He treated me with respect.

181
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,900
Kid was way ahead of his time 
in more ways than one.

182
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,400
now just because you're pretty 

183
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,100
and you think you're mighty wise 

184
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,600
you told me that you loved me 

185
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,700
then you rolled those big brown eyes 

186
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,900
when I saw you last week... 

187
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
uh...
 your eyes were turning black 

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,900
I apologize, sir.

189
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,100
I figured after hours, mr. Valentine's 
"no negro music" rule don't apply.

190
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,700
Won't play it again.

191
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,000
This is wynonie harris, right?

192
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,100
- You know wynonie harris?
- Yeah.

193
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,100
I saw him play in a chicken shack
back on brandywine creek, where I'm from.

194
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,500
Heard about your folks.

195
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,900
Sorry.

196
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,500
I used to sing this song for my mama.

197
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,100
The only thing that'd make her smile.

198
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,200
My daddy was a drunk, see,

199
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,000
confused her for his punching bag.

200
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,100
I think it made her feel a little better 
hearing other people carrying it around-- 
their pain.

201
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,200
Let mama know she wasn't alone.

202
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,500
Yeah.

203
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,100
I think I know how she felt now.

204
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,900
So, you're telling me your uncle
lets you listen to this music?

205
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,800
Come on.

206
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
the night he found my stash 
of louis jordan records,

207
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,700
- smashed every one.
- Mm.

208
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,600
Said he wouldn't have this corrupting 
devil music in his house.

209
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,100
Mm-hmm. 
Now that sound like old man valentine.

210
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,000
hey, you ever see when wynonie 
shakes his leg like this?

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,500
Yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah.

212
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
And then...

213
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,100
he does...

214
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,400
that spin.

215
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,200
ha!

216
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,500
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me 

217
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,100
I could tell

218
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,800
you've been on a spree 

219
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,100
hey, you got some pipes.

220
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,600
Yeah, it's my thing... 

221
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,500
-... singing.
- Hmm.

222
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,300
Just not in front of other people usually.

223
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,200
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes 

224
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,500
hey, you ever try this one?
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes 

225
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,300
got to be good friends,
the two of us,

226
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,400
listening to that music late at night.

227
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,600
Kid was real decent.

228
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,400
But Mr. Valentine had a problem 
with bingo listening to that music?

229
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,600
Old man feared it was the beginning of the end.

230
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,500
First black music,

231
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,600
then blacks sitting at his lunch counter.

232
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,100
Saying he would have hurt bingo over it?

233
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,000
What mr. Valentine said was law,

234
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,900
and he had the temper to back it up, too.

235
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,000
But bingo couldn't hide his love 
of rock 'n' roll from no one.

236
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,300
Understand your husband,
ed valentine,

237
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,000
passed away a few years ago.

238
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,300
It'll be 12 years this christmas.
God rest his soul.

239
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,500
He was a good man?

240
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,600
Oh, yes. 

241
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,900
Ed was an officer in world war ii.

242
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,600
We were happily married, 60 years.

243
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,200
Where was your husband 
the night bingo was killed?

244
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,500
Asleep in his bed.

245
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,400
Right next to mine, of course.

246
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,800
Well, bingo was like a son to us.

247
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,100
We understand your husband didn't approve 
of the rock 'n' roll music bingo listened to.

248
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
No, he certainly did not.

249
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,400
Sounds like neither did you.

250
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,800
Well, the stuff was distasteful.

251
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,300
Ed said all negro music was.

252
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,200
No offense, dear.

253
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,700
None taken.

254
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,900
We were a generation that made it 
through the depression, the war.

255
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,500
We wanted stability, common decency.

256
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,900
And "negro" music wasn't that.

257
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,600
Well, ed said it made the kids go wild.

258
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,000
And, believe you me, it did.

259
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,900
you're gonna be radioactive out there.

260
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:12,400
I wanna sing something real, 
with teeth-- not the usual fake-o, happy land stuff.

261
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,700
...Shed his grace on thee.. 

262
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,100
doesn't matter what your song is, baby.

263
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,100
Just matters that you're singing it.

264
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,500
 ...With brotherhood... 

265
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,700
everyone'll see what I see.

266
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,800
That I'm a fream.

267
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
That you're the razz's berries.

268
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,400
 ...Sea! 

269
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,500
jp and the wishing stars.

270
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,800
I know someone's mother is proud.

271
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,000
now please welcome to the stage 

272
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,300
bingo zohar performing 
"jeanie with the light brown hair."

273
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:10,100
I dream of jeanie with the light brown hair... 

274
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,200
boo! Hiss!

275
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,700
Wake me when the snoozefest is over!

276
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,900
hold back the door and 

277
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,200
stop all the clocks 

278
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,900
I just got the news that my baby wants to rock 

279
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,300
all she wants to do is rock 

280
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,600
all she wants to do is rock 

281
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,000
all she wants to do is rock 

282
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,800
rock 'n' roll all night long 

283
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,300
my baby don't go for fancy clothes 

284
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,400
high-class dinner and picture shows 

285
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,000
all she wants to do is stay at home 

286
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and huckle buck with daddy all night long 

287
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,800
all she wants to do is rock 

288
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,100
all she wants to do is rock 

289
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,400
all she wants to do is rock 

290
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,400
 rock 'n' roll all night long... 

291
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,000
miranda, stop him.

292
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,500
Stop your boyfriend from doing...

293
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,400
whatever it is he's doing.

294
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,000
He's not mine anymore.

295
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,100
Just look at him.

296
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,100
All she wants to do is rock... 

297
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,200
bingo drove the girls wild
with those swiveling hips of his.

298
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,500
Disgraceful.

299
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,900
Kind of like elvis. 

300
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Hot.

301
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,700
So miranda was pushed aside?

302
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,400
Something you want to share, mrs. Valentine?

303
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Shortly after bingo's death,

304
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,400
miranda's mother caught her 
playing russian roulette with a loaded handgun.

305
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,800
Sent her to the state mental ward-- 
poor thing.

306
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Sounds like the "poor thing" 
was off her rocker.

307
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,400
early 50s, white kidsinging black music--

308
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,900
reminds me of elvis.

309
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,300
I hate to admit it.

310
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,900
I broke up with my junior high sweetheart

311
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,500
because she joined the elvis fan club.

312
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,300
No.

313
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,900
Trini rene. 
Back in the late '50s,

314
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,800
the girls were either elvis girls...
or pat boone girls, I remember.

315
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,200
I told trini my family wouldn't approve 
of me going out with an elvis girl.

316
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,000
I guess I was a square.

317
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,100
No, man, 
you were a cube.

318
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,300
My family hated elvis too...

319
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,800
especially the ones who thought 
he ripped off black music.

320
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,500
He certainly was a polarizing figure.

321
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,500
Have to be to make history.

322
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,500
I got the results back on the shirt.

323
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
From bingo's sleeve?

324
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,600
Can't believe evidence still had it 
after all these years.

325
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,100
Yeah, pretty dependable,

326
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,100
guys in that unit.

327
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,700
Nitrocellulose.

328
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,500
Used primarily as a car finish back in the day.

329
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Could be from the car that dumped bingo.

330
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,900
Making it a long shot.

331
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,200
Lot of cars used it.

332
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,100
It's back to square one.

333
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
You have a conversation 
with the jealous girlfriend?

334
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,900
I'm on it.

335
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,800
Have vera go with you.

336
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
No, I got it covered.

337
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,500
What the hell is his problem?

338
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,000
Where were you that night
your boyfriend was shot, Miranda?

339
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Bingo and I went to the drive-in.

340
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,300
We saw the band wagon with fred astaire.

341
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,100
Uh, he dropped me off early.

342
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,900
How early?

343
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,800
About... 10:00 P.M.

344
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,500
That was the last time I saw him.

345
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,100
The next morning,
I received the phone call.

346
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,400
He was dead.

347
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,800
I understand you were locked up in the nuthouse.

348
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,100
Suicide attempt.

349
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,300
18 and your boyfriend is murdered?

350
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,900
I would say that that warrants depression.

351
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,500
Where'd the gun come from?

352
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,300
My mother kept a gun in her bedside table,

353
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,800
next to her pills.

354
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,100
And I bet,

355
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,300
you're going tell me 
you don't have it anymore.

356
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,400
I didn't kill bingo.

357
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,400
He was my first love,

358
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,500
the purest of all my romances.

359
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,800
Well, till you saw him on stage,

360
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,600
turning the other girls on,

361
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,200
and you got pushed to the back row.

362
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,100
It wasn't the girls bingo loved.

363
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,800
It was the music.

364
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah, right.

365
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,700
Bingo never betrayed me.

366
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,300
He shared his limelight.

367
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,800
ooh, hoo-ooh... 

368
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,900
bingo, play that song you showed me for my girl.

369
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,800
She let me polish her headlights.

370
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,400
easy on the word- painting, luke.

371
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,200
Got a lady present.

372
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,700
Looky here, girls,
I'm telling you now... 

373
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,600
Hey, how do you get your hair like that, bingo?

374
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,400
Miranda's the one with the style. 

375
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,200
Ask her.

376
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,700
Need to grow it out,

377
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,700
but it ain't gonna hide that frankenstein 
head of yours.

378
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,200
Ha, ha.

379
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,400
What about you, jp?

380
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,600
Gonna grow your hair out, too?

381
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,000
No. No, high and tight is right for me.

382
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,300
You sound like your dad. 

383
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,500
Yeah, well, imagine what my dad would say 
if I came home looking like you.

384
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,900
Who cares what he'd say?

385
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,500
Don't be a square, jp.

386
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,500
Bingo, 

387
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,800
someone saw that bandstand scout
at your last show.

388
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,200
We hear those rumors after our shows, too.

389
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,700
Nothing ever comes of it.

390
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,500
Maybe we should add some rock 'n' roll beats 
to our line-up.

391
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,100
Maybe dance like bingo, instead of 
all this sidestepping stuff.

392
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,600
Jp & the wishing stars will not be gyrating 
their privates on stage 

393
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,100
like a bunch of natives.

394
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,800
It might serve you to get some practice 
gyrating your privates.

395
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,000
jp! Come on!

396
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,200
It was just a joke.

397
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,500
Hey, come back!

398
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,000
The music was changing.

399
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,900
So were the times.

400
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,200
And, uh, mr. King of the quartet 
was left in the dust.

401
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,700
And you should hear the music 
my granddaughter listens to:

402
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,100
Uh, "milkshake" this and "booty" that.

403
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,600
She made me a playlist 

404
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,400
and I learned to appreciate it.

405
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,500
Like you learned to appreciate bingo's music?

406
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,700
It took me a while. I guess I was a stick 
in the mud back then.

407
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,200
Where were you the night bingo was killed?

408
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,500
At wishing star practice.

409
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,400
Like clockwork saturday nights.

410
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,000
You and the wishing stars ever 
incorporate bingo's style into your act?

411
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We did. 

412
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,600
As a matter of fact, we picked up some of his moves 
and played one of his songs, too.

413
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,300
Yeah? Which one?

414
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,600
I can't remember the name,

415
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,600
but the chorus was something like, uh,

416
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,400
I'll take my chance, 'cause the truth be told
 you only get one dance. 

417
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,100
It sounds meaningful.

418
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,100
I liked that one.

419
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
Not too racy.

420
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,100
Well, it wasn't always the lyrics that were racy.

421
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,000
It was the, the beat that unnerved people.

422
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,100
The beat?

423
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,500
Things were different back then.

424
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,700
Neighborhoods were segregated,
even the music,

425
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,300
and the beat was considered an african-american... 
thing.

426
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,600
So bingo bringing that sort of "thing" 
into your world had repercussions.

427
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,700
Oh, sure.

428
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,500
And some people took the heat more than others.

429
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,600
Dad, can we watch bandstand?

430
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,700
No one wants to watch kids dance.

431
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,900
That show is going to get yanked.

432
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,100
We're going to watch milton berle 
like we always do.

433
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,900
Uncle ed, you haven't received 
a telegram for me, have you?

434
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,400
Hoping to hear from bandstand, actually.

435
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,500
They don't play your kind of music.

436
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,800
nothing for you, bingo.

437
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,400
But jp here was accepted at princeton.

438
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,800
Go show him the letter, son.

439
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,100
Didn't go to college myself.

440
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,100
Jp, first one in the family...

441
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,100
I noticed that you and bingo are pinned.

442
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,800
Oh, it's just for fun--

443
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,300
ironic, actually.

444
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,200
Ironic?

445
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:21,100
Oh, well, it's our anti-commitment to never plan 
for the future for the rest of our lives.

446
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,200
If you don't plan for a future, 

447
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,600
what will you live on?

448
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,200
Love and music.

449
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,900
miranda, I'm sure your mother 
has explained this to you,

450
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,200
but your husband's livelihood will be 
your livelihood.

451
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,100
I guess I thought I'd get my own job or something.

452
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Oh. 

453
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,100
As a teacher or a nurse?

454
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,400
Miranda, dear,

455
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,800
I suggest you secure a future for yourself

456
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,800
before the bloom is off the rose.

457
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,100
You don't want to end up a penniless old maid, now, 
do you?

458
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,400
Since jp is going away to college,

459
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,400
I'll need someone to take over the store someday, 

460
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,100
so i am promoting you to counter manager, bingo.

461
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,600
uh, thank you, sir, 

462
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,400
but I...

463
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,800
I was really hoping to focus on my music.

464
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Can we afford to give promotions right now, ed?

465
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,700
Mother, don't you worry your pretty little head 
about money.

466
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,700
I fired aces anyhow. 

467
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Aces?

468
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,900
But he's your best worker.

469
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,300
That job is the only thing that's keeping his family 
out of the poorhouse.

470
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,400
Well, he should've thought about that 
before he left that devil music on the jukebox.

471
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,000
Oh, no, sir,
I left that record on.

472
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,400
No need to cover for him, son.

473
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,100
Kid's a bad apple.

474
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,300
Now he's gone.

475
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,700
So aces didn't quit.

476
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,900
He was fired.

477
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,900
Bingo was determined to find him.

478
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
He wanted to make it up to him somehow.

479
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,400
When was this?

480
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,300
A few days before he was killed.

481
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,600
Aces worked five solid years for mr. Valentine.

482
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,300
Gets fired 'cause of bingo.

483
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,400
Maybe he catches up with him at the five-and-dime, 
gets even?

484
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,500
So why make the distinction of quitting...

485
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,800
Wake up, miller.

486
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,800
The guy's covering his motive.

487
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
...Unless he's covering his motive.

488
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,900
You want to let me finish?

489
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
Scotty.

490
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,000
We need to talk.

491
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,600
so go ahead. Air it out now.

492
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,700
'Cause if I got to watch you stomping around here 
like some bullheaded jackass one more minute, 

493
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,000
somebody's gonna lose some teeth.

494
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,300
Ain't gonna be the only one, brother.

495
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,600
You really think one of us 
ratted you out to iad?

496
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,500
You tell me.

497
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,100
Who do you think you're talking to, scotty?

498
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,000
You know us better than that.

499
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,500
Then who was it, hmm,

500
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,900
told that iad jerk about burrell?

501
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,400
Get real, man.

502
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,600
You think we're the only ones who knew?

503
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,600
People talk, but you start turning on the people 
that's got your back...

504
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,200
it ain't your job they're coming after now, 
is it, will?

505
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,100
They're out to get me, man.

506
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Using this burrell thing as an excuse 
to hang me on the shoot.

507
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,300
Iad's on a fishing expedition.

508
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
That's what they do.

509
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,100
Nah.

510
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,200
This guy won't let it go.

511
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,000
They want my badge.

512
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,600
Boss'll never let that happen.

513
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,300
And you got to know, 
none of us would ever help them.

514
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,000
I don't get it, will.

515
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,100
It was a good shoot.

516
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,200
Well, you did the right thing.

517
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,000
Then why are they coming after me?

518
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,600
I don't know.

519
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,200
But you got to hang tough, 
circle the wagons.

520
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,000
And stop acting like such a jackass.

521
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,700
yeah.

522
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,500
all right, then, 

523
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,300
maybe I should scream or something, 

524
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,900
so they don't think we're in here hugging.

525
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,400
Yeah, make it sound good.

526
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,300
Scotty, look!

527
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,700
No cop in their right mind 
plays along with iad!

528
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,200
They don't like us.

529
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,700
We don't like them!

530
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,300
what's going on?

531
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,200
Scotty and will.

532
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,600
Having a talk.

533
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,200
About time.

534
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,300
Found aces' social security records.

535
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,300
Checks out.

536
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,300
He was fired a week before bingo's murder.

537
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,600
Picked up a part-time job
finishing cars at an auto repair.

538
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,300
Using nitrocellulose.

539
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,800
It's the same substance found on bingo's sleeve 
the night he was killed.

540
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,100
Hm, looks like bingo found aces after all.

541
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,100
... with bingo the night he was murdered.

542
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,000
Found nitrocellulose on bingo's sleeve.

543
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,300
From your job working on cars.

544
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
Turns out you didn't quit the five-and-dime.

545
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,500
You were fired.

546
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:36,500
I lose everything 'cause some white kid forgets 
to take a record off the juke,

547
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:43,100
while mr. Valentine spends his night 
pawing the makeup girl behind his office door?

548
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,100
World ain't just.

549
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,400
So you got even.

550
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,900
You could say that.

551
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,700
I saw bingo that night,

552
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,200
standing about where you are now.

553
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,500
Why lie about it, aces?

554
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,000
Why do you think?!

555
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,500
Grew up black, didn't you?

556
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,000
Maybe it was different for you,

557
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,900
but for my generation,

558
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,900
the color lines weren't drawn exactly fair.

559
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,300
Talk about that night.

560
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,400
Treated the kid bad. 

561
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,900
Stomped on his dream...

562
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,000
you ain't nothin' but a hound dog 

563
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,700
been snoopin' 'round my door 

564
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,700
you ain't nothin' but a hound dog 

565
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,400
been snoopin' 'round my door 

566
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,500
you can wag your tail 

567
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,600
but I ain't gonna feed you no more 

568
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,300
you told me you were high-class 

569
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,500
but I could see through that... 

570
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,800
you're a hard man to find.

571
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,700
...But I could see through that... 

572
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,700
it ain't right what my uncle did.

573
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,400
He's trying to give me a promotion.

574
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,900
I told him I wouldn't take it.

575
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,100
Man, you really don't get it,

576
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,000
- do you?
- What?

577
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,800
We do not live in the same world.

578
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,900
This is two towns.

579
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,100
Rules ain't the same in both.

580
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,000
You think it's hep to dress like a colored man,

581
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,700
sing like a colored man?

582
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,200
That make you cool?

583
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,800
But you don't suffer the consequences 
of a colored man.

584
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,700
Do you?

585
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,400
No. I don'T.

586
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,600
That ain't right.

587
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,500
Hey, but this music...

588
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,100
it's the only thing that speaks to me.

589
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,500
You don't even know what it means.

590
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,100
You don't think I know about loss?

591
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,400
About wanting the pain to go away, but it won't?

592
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
About living when you think you can't go on.

593
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,100
I'd be lost without my music.

594
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,400
Then sing it like you mean it.

595
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,800
Make it your own.

596
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,400
How do I do that?

597
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,000
Ain't you always, uh,

598
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,700
scribbling something down? Your songs?

599
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,400
Not ready to share that yet.

600
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,100
Then get out of my face.

601
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,500
Bingo!

602
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,800
Mrs. Valentine told me you turned down the promotion.

603
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,700
How could you?!

604
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,900
Miranda?!What are you doing here?

605
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,500
What about our future?!

606
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,700
You have to take it!

607
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,000
You have to tell mr. Valentine you will right now.

608
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,200
Bingo: Keep it down.

609
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,100
What has gotten into you?

610
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,300
Don't tell me to keep it down!

611
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,600
Let's talk out back.

612
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,700
so miranda came here the night bingo was murdered?

613
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,300
Brought her out back to talk.

614
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,200
Same place his body was dumped.

615
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Valens: "Bingo and I went "to the drive-in.

616
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
"Saw the band wagon with fred astaire.

617
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,800
He dropped me off early."

618
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,600
But you saw him later that night.

619
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,200
Behind red hot mama'S.

620
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
That wasn't me.

621
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,000
You panicked.

622
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,400
Demanded bingo take that promotion.

623
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,700
Secure his future.

624
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,700
And yours.

625
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,300
So what happened to living on love and music,miranda?

626
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,900
I lost faith in myself.

627
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,000
In us.

628
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,800
There were no opportunities for me then.

629
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,500
I was terrified I'd be dependent

630
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,700
on a broke musician the rest of my life.

631
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,200
Mrs. Valentine got to you.

632
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,700
The times got to me.

633
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,700
I didn't want to end up like my mother.

634
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,500
Nobody does.

635
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,800
And so...

636
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,900
I told bingo

637
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,300
he had to give up everything that he was.

638
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,600
I'm sorry.

639
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,400
I'm sorry, bingo,

640
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,100
but mrs. Valentine is right.

641
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,700
I can't be a nurse.

642
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,300
Blood makes me queasy.

643
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,600
And I'm not gonna be a teacher.

644
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,600
Why not?

645
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,200
Kids think I'm weird.

646
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,400
We'll make it on my music.

647
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,200
No.

648
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,600
I have to hurry before my rose is off the bloom.

649
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,400
I think your rose is just fine.

650
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,000
you love me, right, bingo?

651
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,600
Of course I do.

652
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,300
Then we should get married.

653
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,900
Settle down.

654
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,100
Buy a house, a car,start a savings account.

655
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,900
You'll need a job--a steady paycheck.

656
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,200
No.We don't need any of that.

657
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,300
We've got love and music,

658
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,400
the only things that are real anyhow.

659
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,100
Huh, you remember?

660
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,400
Bingo,if that telegram

661
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,900
from bandstand were coming,

662
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,800
it would have made it already.

663
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,300
It's time to grow up.

664
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,500
You need to be realistic about the limitations of your talent.

665
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,200
You're just not...

666
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,600
that talented.

667
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,400
But we can be happy together.

668
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,500
Settled.

669
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,400
Safe.

670
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,800
Right, bingo?

671
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,600
I'll talk to my uncle.

672
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,100
He's probably still at the store.

673
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,100
I love you, Bingo

674
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,100
It was a lie, of course.

675
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,800
Bingo was tremendously talented.

676
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,400
But talent ain't the same as security.

677
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Mmm.

678
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,400
And the next morning bingo was dead.

679
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
Turns out....

680
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
security doesn't exist.

681
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:12,900
what's up?

682
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,500
Warrant came through on the old five-and-dime.

683
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,600
Feel like fishing for a bullet?

684
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,200
What do we got?

685
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,600
Did some more digging on nitrocellulose.

686
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,400
Turns out it was used for making records.

687
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,300
the old recording booth in the five-and-dime.

688
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,800
You know,if bingo was recording when he got shot,

689
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,700
he could have fallen back into the record.

690
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,800
????

691
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,000
Looks like karma's on our side today.

692
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,000
.40 or .45.

693
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,500
Wasn't common back in the '50s.

694
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,200
Street thugs were using .38 revolvers then.

695
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,100
But my father had a .45--

696
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,300
world war ii military issue.

697
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,100
He an officer like uncle ed?

698
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,300
War hero, too.

699
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,500
Know ed worked nights at the five-and-dime.

700
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,700
Getting made over by the makeup girl.

701
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,700
If bingo caught him,

702
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,200
it could've turned ugly.

703
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,300
??? at home with you

704
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,400
No the night of bingo's murder.

705
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,900
He was at the five-and-dime,wasn't he?

706
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm not sure.

707
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,100
Frankly, it was so long ago.

708
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,300
Spent a lot of nights at the store, old ed.

709
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,800
And not by his lonesome, either.

710
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,800
I used to tell myself that

711
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,000
she was for his urges.

712
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,700
I was the one he truly loved.

713
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,800
Now you know I'm a fool.

714
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,200
We found a bullet.

715
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Matches the type of gun mr. Valentine used in the war.

716
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,500
Ed was a philanderer, but he...

717
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,500
he-he never would've hurt his own nephew's own blood.

718
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,900
His own blood caught him with his pants down.

719
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,000
Could've ruined his marriage,his reputation.

720
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,500
Isn't it time to stop protecting your husband?

721
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,900
Ed wasn't with me that night.

722
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,100
But he wasn't at the store,either.

723
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,200
oh, sorry to scare you.

724
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,000
Oh, no, you didn't scare me.

725
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm just, um, uh, looking for uncle ed.

726
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,300
Oh, he's at the store, dear.

727
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,800
No, ma'am.I just came from there,

728
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,700
and, uh, he...

729
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,400
it's one thing when he's doing it behind closed doors,

730
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,900
but to go out with her...

731
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,500
someone could see.

732
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,000
My marriage just one big stinking lie,

733
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,600
and I am a fool to believe otherwise.

734
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,800
But it isn't foolish to believe.

735
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,100
If only I had gone to college,

736
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,200
I could've done something with my life.

737
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,400
I dropped out for him.

738
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,900
To start a family.

739
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,100
A home.

740
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,200
Well, maybe it isn't too late.

741
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,600
It is for me.

742
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,600
but I was good at it.

743
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,200
I loved it, you know.

744
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,600
Nobody should keep you from doing what you love.

745
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,400
There's something I need to show you.

746
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,400
that's from bandstand.

747
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,100
They saw you perform, bingo, and they liked you.

748
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,300
A lot.

749
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,000
They want a record to play for their producers...

750
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,200
by tomorrow morning.

751
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,300
Well, you'd better hurry.

752
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,300
Oh...

753
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,200
use the recording booth at the store.

754
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
But I don't know what to sing.

755
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,500
Well, you must have something.

756
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,200
I have an original, actually,

757
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,400
been puzzling together.

758
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Not ready, though.

759
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Can't get the chorus right.

760
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,400
Let-let's hear it.

761
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,800
Uh...

762
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,600
I'll take my chance 

763
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,500
'cause truth be told  you only get one

764
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
life to live. 

765
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,000
I... it just doesn't work. 

766
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,100
Chance--you can't rhyme chance with chance.

767
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,200
Dance.

768
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
You only get one dance.

769
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,400
That's it.

770
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That's great.

771
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,000
I'll take my chance 

772
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,500
'cause truth be told you only get one dance. 

773
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
what if I'm no good?

774
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,100
What if you are?

775
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,100
No one should stop you from doing what you love, bingo.

776
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,100
Ed came in a few minutes later...

777
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,300
reeking of cheap perfume and whiskey.

778
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,400
And you never left him.

779
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,100
I should've.

780
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,400
But then bingo...

781
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,300
I stayed.

782
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,000
Arranged the funeral.

783
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,500
Kept up appearances.

784
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,200
It was easier.

785
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,600
That chorus--

786
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,700
...you ever tell anyone about it?

787
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
No. Why?

788
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,900
"I'll take my chance 

789
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,500
"'cause truth be told

790
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,300
you only get one dance."

791
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,700
You weren't at wishing star practice, jp.

792
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,400
You were at home.

793
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,400
You must be confused.

794
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,800
We talked to your old pals.

795
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,200
They kicked you out.

796
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,200
Wanted to play rock 'n' roll.

797
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
Not you, though.

798
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,000
You heard your mother confess

799
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,900
she was trapped in a loveless marriage,

800
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,900
and that your father was a philanderer.

801
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,600
Before bingo came along,

802
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,900
everything made sense.

803
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,900
You father was a great war hero,

804
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,500
your mother the doting housewife.

805
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,400
And you--

806
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,300
the golden boy everyone wanted to be.

807
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,200
But bingo had that new style--

808
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
that cool,new sound.

809
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,800
And everyone in your life started changing because of him.

810
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,500
No. Bingo was a fream.

811
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,800
He didn't have the power to change people.

812
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,600
But he did.

813
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,100
That's why you had to get rid of him.

814
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,700
Restore your world to its rightful place.

815
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,200
Do you really think that I could shoot my own cousin?

816
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,100
No.

817
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,300
You didn't need to...

818
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,900
but it happened.

819
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,700
I just wanted him... to leave.

820
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,300
I wanted my life back the way it was.

821
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,100
So you took your father's gun

822
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,400
to scare him off.

823
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,100
But he wouldn't listen, would he?

824
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,000
I...

825
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,100
just...

826
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,200
wanted him...

827
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
gone.

828
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,200
I'm taking my chance  'cause truth be told,

829
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,500
you only get one dance 

830
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,200
gee, jp, you scared me half to death.

831
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,800
We have to leave now.

832
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,700
What?

833
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,200
I'm taking you back to brandywine,

834
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,400
where you belong.

835
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,200
What's wrong with you?

836
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,800
I heard the lies that you made my mother say.

837
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,100
I'm about the only one not lying.

838
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,500
Everything was perfect

839
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,800
until you came.

840
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Perfect?

841
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,500
What's so perfect about a smart woman

842
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,500
like your mom baking cookies

843
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,200
instead of following her dream?

844
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,800
Or a guy like aces getting fired

845
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
just 'cause he's colored?

846
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,700
Shut up!

847
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,700
You don't know anything.

848
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,500
What's perfect about miranda out of her gourd

849
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,700
'cause she's scared she's nothing without a man.

850
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,700
It's a twisted world, jp.

851
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,500
It ain't all puppy dogs and holding hands.

852
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,300
Open your eyes.

853
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,400
I was happy.

854
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,900
Everyone was happy.

855
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,000
My family was happy.

856
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,500
And I'm going to make sure they're happy again.

857
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,300
I know times are changing and for the good.

858
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,500
And I'm seeing to it

859
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,800
the only way I know how.

860
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,800
Not if I can help it.

861
