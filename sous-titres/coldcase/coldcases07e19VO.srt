<i>Previously on Cold Case:</i>

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,900
Lil, I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine, Diane Yates.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,900
Agent Yates. FBI.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,400
<i>Shaver enters the sh (gunshot) ne...</i>

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,800
We have a serial killer.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
<i>Last one was 27 years ago.</i>

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,600
Your father's a suspect in a series of unsolved shootings.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,800
Here come the FBI storm troopers.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,800
Anything ?

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,900
William Shepard.

11
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,600
What the hell ?

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,500
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,800
October 12.1978

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,200
Keep it steady.

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,300
Don't think. Just...

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,200
trust your hands.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
There you go.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,400
That's it.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,200
That's a decent Adams.

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,000
See if you catch any fish with it first

21
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,201
before you go celebrating too much.

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,500
I mean, that's the problem in life.

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,800
Pride.

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,000
People think they can't help it.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,100
But man has a choice...

26
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,400
And that's where
he's different from an animal.

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,200
That's right.

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,300
It's from East of Eden.

29
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,300
Only showed it 20 times.

30
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,800
Yeah.

31
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,500
At the drive-in.

32
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Well, I guess you're right,

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,400
but it doesn't make it any less true,
take it from me.

34
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,700
They got a Dirty Harry double bill
playing in town.

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,900
Maybe we could go.

36
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,300
Sure.

37
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,200
We'll see.

38
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,400
Why don't you go grab us
some firewood.

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,500
Paul.

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,400
You're a good kid.

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,400
<i>"Snake song" by Townes Van Zandt.</i>

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,100
Dad ?

43
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,100
Dad ?

44
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,800
Dad ?

45
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,800
Dad !

46
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,600
We have no sign of the shooter
from the post office,

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,000
but we found his van abandoned
at an old campground.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,500
Cause of death looks like
a single bullet.

49
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,600
Exit wound through
the top of the skull.

50
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,700
Suicide.

51
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,900
Bill Shepard.

52
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,400
Killed four people,
then himself back in 1983.

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,000
We got a different take, John.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,100
Yates ?

55
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
You got me, G-Man.

56
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,700
You're suspended pending an OPR.

57
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:06,901
That coming from you or HQ ?

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,300
Even if I wanted to protect you,

59
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:10,201
I couldn't once those shots were fired.

60
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,300
And you're about a hundred miles
out of your jurisdiction.

61
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,300
And you'd be about 500 miles
away from this cabin without her.

62
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,000
No thanks to you playing keep-away.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,400
Well, such a crack investigator,

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,500
figured you'd find it on your own.

65
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Always this insubordinate, Lieutenant ?

66
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,600
- Not to me. Can we get on with this ?
- Absolutely.

67
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,500
Ryan, when you're done
putting 'em on the table,

68
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:29,301
come and see what we've got.

69
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,300
So ME estimates

70
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,800
Bill Shepard offed himself about 30 years ago.

71
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,000
But all that time someone's been paying
property tax

72
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:40,201
on this cabin using
a local checking account.

73
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,200
Even after Shepard died,
paid up every year.

74
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,100
So there's checks from the late '70s, early '80s.

75
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,500
The signatures are different.

76
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,000
They changed somewhere around
the fall of 1978.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,100
From this... to this.

78
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,100
Bill Shepard dropped off the face
of the earth in 1978,

79
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,800
but our first body dropped
in 1980.

80
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,900
So Shepard's dead before
the first murders ?

81
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,500
Means someone else did the killing.

82
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah. Bill's son, Paul Shepard.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,500
Yeah, the bag from his video store.

84
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,600
Half-empty box of 25-aught-six cartridges.

85
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,000
Same as our sniper's ammo.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,700
Paul claimed that his father ran off,

87
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,600
but he's been coming up here.

88
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,100
Makes him what, 16,
when the first murder occurred ?

89
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,500
Awful young for a serial killer.

90
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,100
Old enough to pull a trigger.

91
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,100
Scotty, tell me you found Paul Shepard.

92
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,300
No, but I sure as hell know
where he's been.

93

Cold Case
Saison 7 Épisode 19

94
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Transcript VO : www.ragbear.com

95
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,500
The bullet - Part 2

96
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,300
Theodore Kutler,
26-year-old grad student.

97
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,600
Took a bullet coming out of his
apartment couple hours ago.

98
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,400
Witnesses ?

99
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,800
Well, several people heard the shot,

100
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,000
and one witness saw a muzzle
flash from that building.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,300
There was a shell casing
found on the roof.

102
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,500
Getting sloppy.

103
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,400
He's on a spree.

104
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
I'll take that.

105
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Last I heard, Ninth and Cherry
was still Philadelphia proper.

106
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,900
Well, if you want to get that evidence
processed this year,

107
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,100
we're gonna have to send it
to my lab.

108
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,800
Unless, of course, you don't trust me.

109
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,200
Scotty, work the scene, huh ?

110
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Not looking for a jurisdiction war.

111
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,200
It's only a matter of time
before the media finds out

112
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,500
we have an active serial killer
on a rampage.

113
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,800
Well, what do you propose ?

114
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,200
Joint task force.
Your guys and mine.

115
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,700
Hey, look, no one's up
to speed like Rush.

116
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,200
She runs point on this.

117
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,500
Fair enough. But we prosecute.

118
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,500
Yates, too.

119
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,300
- It's her case.
- No deal.

120
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,400
Yates has already booked a one-way ticket
to the Anchorage field office.

121
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600
Cavanaugh ?

122
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,900
Change of plans.

123
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,700
Rush and I have field command
with your oversight.

124
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,000
According to who ?

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,400
Well, you, actually.

126
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,500
Just got off the phone
with the SAC.

127
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,400
Let him know your plans
to pursue the case, and he signed off.

128
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,100
Even you don't have the balls, Yates.

129
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, call him yourself, Ryan,
if you don't believe me.

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,700
'Course you're gonna have
to explain how I went off

131
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,600
the reservation for a week,

132
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:08,901
opened this case solo,

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,500
while you sat
in your corner office clueless.

134
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,900
Don't pout, Ryan.

135
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,500
It causes frown lines.

136
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,600
Bad news is she likes you.

137
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,300
Or maybe she just cares
about the job.

138
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,700
You've known her, what,

139
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:29,501
three days ?

140
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Yates talks a good game,

141
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,901
but she's reckless.

142
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,200
Being told that before our victim
was a grad student,

143
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,600
he was the manager
at the Long View Video store.

144
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,100
That was Paul Shepard's place.

145
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,600
Anything different about Paul lately ?

146
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,400
He seem aggravated, depressed ?

147
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,600
No. No more than usual.

148
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,900
You-You guys need, like,
a warrant to be here ?

149
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,000
'Cause I'm in charge.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
When was the last time you saw Paul ?

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,400
Uh, yesterday ?

152
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,300
No, no. Day before.

153
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,500
Uh, no. Thursday.

154
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,200
It was...

155
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,700
It was Thursday.

156
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,400
What are you doing on that thing ?

157
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, totally Tweeting all this.

158
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,100
Dude.

159
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,700
Hey, Brian,
focus.

160
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
Tell us about your relationship
with Paul.

161
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,300
All right, Theo was the manager;
Paul was the owner.

162
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
Little more detail.

163
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,100
Like why Theo didn't work here anymore.

164
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,800
He quit ? Get fired ?

165
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,900
Oh, oh, definitely fired.

166
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,400
What the hell happened, Theo ?

167
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,500
- We were robbed.
- Yeah, I can see that.

168
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,200
They wrecked the place.

169
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,300
But the windows aren't broken.

170
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,100
The locks are untouched.

171
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,900
The alarm didn't go off.

172
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,600
You see where I'm going
with this, Theo ?

173
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,700
I was kind of out of it last night.

174
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,000
My girlfriend and I were fighting, and...

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,300
I went over there.

176
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
Might have neglected to...

177
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,200
You might have neglected ?

178
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,400
Do you understand what this means, Theo?

179
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,200
The insurance won't pay
if the alarm wasn't on.

180
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,900
Maybe I could chip in.

181
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,200
It's-It's not just the money.

182
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,300
I mean, look at this stuff.

183
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,100
It's-It's irreplaceable.

184
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,400
I mean, do you... do you have any

185
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
idea how long it took me
to fix this place up ?

186
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,600
<i>"Pity and fear"
by Death Cab For Cutie.</i>

187
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,100
You know what ?

188
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,600
Just-Just get the hell out of here!

189
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,600
Yeah, those repairs cost, like, a ton.

190
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,900
Paul had to close the other stores

191
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,700
just to make up the difference.

192
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,400
You know, it's not like the vid biz
is a growth industry.

193
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,300
We're gonna need access
to your safe,

194
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:06,701
any financials you have here.

195
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,400
All right, in the office.

196
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,300
Um, I-I got...

197
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,100
tardiness issues.

198
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,700
You think Paul's gunning for me, too ?

199
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,100
You might want to stop
Tweeting about it.

200
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,300
Where is your husband right now,
Mrs. Shepard ?

201
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,400
I don't know.

202
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,801
When was the last time
you saw him ?

203
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,600
Uh, yesterday morning.

204
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,000
Is that normal ?

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,900
Disappearing for a day and a half ?

206
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,200
What's going on ?

207
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,300
We're just looking to talk to Paul.

208
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,400
If it was just to talk,
then the FBI wouldn't be here.

209
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,300
Well, that's right, Mrs. Shepard.

210
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,300
The fact is, we think your husband

211
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:50,101
may have been involved
in a shooting.

212
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,700
He own a rifle you know of ?

213
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,400
You think he shot someone ?

214
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Claire, I understand how difficult
this is for you,

215
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,200
but Paul's out there right now,

216
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,000
and no matter what he did
or didn't do,

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,700
the best thing for everyone

218
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,801
is to bring him back safely.

219
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:06,602
He's, uh...

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,400
He's been under a lot of pressure lately

221
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,900
with the video stores.

222
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,500
There a place that he goes
to when he's feeling

223
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,300
stressed or under pressure ,

224
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:17,401
other than the cabin ?

225
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,900
What cabin ?

226
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,200
The cabin your husband owns
in Mount Pocono.

227
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,300
Which is where we found this.

228
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,600
That's Bill Shepard,

229
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,800
Paul's father.

230
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,300
His father ? Uh...

231
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,600
He ever talk about him ?

232
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,700
Oh, my God.

233
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,500
He ever tell you
how his father died ?

234
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
No.

235
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,400
I found out on my own...

236
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,700
<i>"It's a bad man's world"
by Jenny Lewis.</i>

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,799
What the hell are you doing ?

238
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,399
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,200
I was just looking for stamps.

240
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,799
You told me your father walked out on you.

241
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,199
This is a suicide note.

242
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,700
What's the difference ?

243
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,699
Gone is gone.

244
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,799
How did it happen ?

245
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,299
He shot himself.

246
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,899
Nothing I could do.

247
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,200
You ?

248
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,199
Paul...

249
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,000
You were the one who found him ?

250
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,899
You should have just asked me
for the damn stamps.

251
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,399
I'm sorry.

252
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,700
That must have been so hard.

253
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,499
It's something I will never do to you.

254
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,499
You understand me ?

255
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,499
I will never leave you...

256
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,600
or the family we're making.

257
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,199
Well, what if we can't make a family ?

258
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,799
We've been trying for two years.

259
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,499
Then we keep trying.

260
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,199
It's so expensive.

261
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,899
Come on.

262
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,600
You let me worry about that, okay ?

263
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,699
He never liked to talk
about his family.

264
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,100
That part of him was...

265
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:25,701
closed off.

266
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,700
You really have no idea
who your husband is, do you ?

267
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,499
"I can't do this anymore.

268
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,799
I am nothing.

269
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,299
Less than nothing.

270
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,099
This world is full of people willing

271
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,599
to kick you when you're down,

272
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,499
like the secretary too blind
to realize she works for thieves;

273
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,700
like the repo men, devoid
of common human decency.

274
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,200
Like the judgmental bus driver
who offered nothing but pity.

275
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,199
And finally, to my son Paul,

276
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,999
I'm sorry, but I'm too wea
to take you with me.

277
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,399
I tried to make something special,

278
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,099
but nobody seems to care.
Nobody ever will."

279
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,299
Suicide note written
by Bill Shepard in 1978.

280
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,599
We believe his son Paul

281
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,799
used this note
as a blueprint for revenge.

282
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,099
Barry Jensen, Felicity Andrews,
Preston Schmall, Fred Norris--

283
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,599
killed between 1980 and '83.

284
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,399
Mel Shaver, Walt Granville,

285
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,699
Theo Kutler; cut down within
the last five months.

286
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,699
He's not haphazard.
Not in it for the thrill.

287
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,999
Shepard has an objective.

288
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,499
There was a pattern to his first killings.

289
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,199
Figure out the pattern today,

290
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,600
maybe we catch him
before he kills again.

291
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,199
We were able to remotely clone
Paul Shepard's cell phone.

292
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,699
Anything he hears or says,
we pick it up.

293
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,099
Got this five minutes ago.

294
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,499
<i>Hey, it's Paul.</i>

295
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,499
<i>I was hoping you guys were around.</i>

296
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,899
<i>I wanted to drop by.</i>

297
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,899
<i>Tonight's lasagna night, right ?</i>

298
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,699
<i>Anyway, I'll try again later.</i>

299
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,499
Number belongs to Charles and Rita Gleason

300
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,699
of Morristown, New Jersey.

301
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,399
Shepard's aunt and uncle.
Raised him after his father died.

302
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,699
Turned off his phone after that,

303
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,100
but we were able to pick up
a GPS signal.

304
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,699
Right outside the Gleasons' house.

305
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,499
There's no sign of Paul Shepard.

306
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,099
Aunt and uncle were at a neighbor's.

307
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,799
Came back, their car was missing.

308
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,699
He took their car ?

309
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,300
So how'd he get here ?

310
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Clear.

311
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,999
What do you got ?

312
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,899
ID on that dead truck driver,
Ned Cotner.

313
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,799
Reported missing last night.

314
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,299
Up near Paul Shepard's cabin.

315
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,699
Shepard must have carjacked him.

316
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,139
Left the truck and the body at his aunt
and uncle's place,

317
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,140
took their car.

318
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,199
May have a line on the next victim.

319
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,799
Now, most of Paul Shepard's
original

320
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,999
were mentioned in his father's
suicide note.

321
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,299
Bill Shepard killed himself
when he was 45.

322
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:07,999
Paul Shepard

323
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,599
turned 45 in October
last year.

324
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,899
Well, children of suicides dread
reaching the age

325
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,000
of their parent's death.

326
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,699
Paul got revenge on the people
he blamed for his father's failure.

327
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,099
Well, now he's getting revenge
on the people he blames for his own.

328
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,999
Felicity Andrews, killed in 1981.

329
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,399
She neglected to file loan paperwork.

330
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,799
Bill Shepard blamed her for losing
his drive-in

331
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,500
when he defaulted.

332
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,399
Theo Kutler forgot to lock up
Paul's video store,

333
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,799
resulting in a break-in.

334
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,899
The loss crippled his business.

335
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,699
Then there's Preston Schmall,
repo man,

336
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,799
shot in '82.

337
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,899
Took his dad's car,

338
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,799
disabling his ability to go to work.

339
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,899
According to witnesses,

340
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,799
Paul's father begged Schmall
to give him another week.

341
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,799
Even suggesting they shared
a brotherhood...

342
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,199
both former marines.

343
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,599
Been looking through
Paul's correspondence.

344
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,399
Found a dozen letters from
his accountant, Kenneth Hoag.

345
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,599
"Paul, you have to face facts.

346
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,999
The IRS will not go away.

347
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,199
I won't be able to stop them
from taking your store."

348
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,099
You think this accountant
is a matchup for the repo man ?

349
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,899
Guy's not just Paul's accountant.

350
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,599
They went to college together.

351
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,299
Fraternity brothers.

352
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,900
Well, let's pick him up
before Paul picks him off.

353
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,599
Is Paul in some kind of danger ?

354
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,199
He may be, Mrs. Gleason.

355
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,699
That's why we need your help.

356
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,499
Any idea why he came here ?

357
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,599
He's my nephew.

358
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,099
I practically raised him.

359
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,399
He doesn't need a reason.

360
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,999
When's the last time you saw him ?

361
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,799
Uh, not since Thanksgiving.

362
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,299
Did something happen
on Thanksgiving ?

363
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,399
What does that have to do
with a dead body out there ?

364
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,099
Just trying to find your nephew.

365
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,999
Well, nothing happened
at Thanksgiving,

366
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,899
and obviously, I-I don't know

367
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,799
where Paul is. Clearly,

368
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,799
you don't either.

369
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,599
Has Paul had any trouble recently ?

370
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,299
Paul doesn't get in trouble.

371
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,599
Don't you find it strange
that he took your car,

372
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,199
and he left a truck
with a corpse in it ?

373
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,299
Well, you're suggesting he had
something to do with the dead body.

374
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,099
Yup, that's what I'm suggesting.

375
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,799
That's ridiculous.

376
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,799
You said that you practically
raised him.

377
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,799
How did he end up living here ?

378
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,899
Oh, my sister Martha died
when he was very young.

379
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,899
And then his father left.

380
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,199
We were all he had.

381
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,099
Poor boy.

382
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,300
You don't know what he was like
when he first came here.

383
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,300
Paul ?

384
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,399
Darling, are you all right ?

385
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,300
It's East of Eden, Aunt Rita.

386
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,099
James Dean,

387
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,599
Raymond Massey.

388
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,799
Directed by Elia Kazan.

389
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,299
You've seen it before ?

390
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,099
Dozens of times.

391
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,099
My dad showed it every year.

392
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,899
That's nice, dear,
but you're not eating.

393
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,400
You must be hungry.

394
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,199
You don't have to wait to be served.

395
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,699
You're family.

396
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,600
One of us, okay ?

397
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,499
He was so forlorn.

398
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,499
A glass half-empty

399
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,799
kind of kid for a long time.

400
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,199
But he adapted ?

401
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,299
He was a good student.

402
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,299
Got a job after school,
volunteered at the church.

403
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,399
And you weren't curious where
he'd disappear to all those weekends ?

404
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,099
Oh, he went camping a lot.

405
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,699
No. No, not camping.

406
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,899
No. See, while you were here
baking pies, Aunt Rita,

407
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
he was out there dropping bodies.

408
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,399
Yates, Yates... You think

409
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,599
Paul killed someone ?

410
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,599
Ma'am, we just want to talk to him.

411
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,599
So if you could tell us...

412
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,099
- He couldn't even hurt a fly.
- Felicity Andrews.

413
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,499
Preston Schmall, Fred Norris.

414
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,399
Barry Jensen, and that's just
on your watch.

415
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,199
- It's a lie.
- No, it's not a lie.

416
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,399
You look at Barry.
You see that blood ?

417
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,499
Now, you tell me
who's living the lie, sister.

418
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,000
Yates.

419
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,699
Mr. Hoag, I'm Lieutenant Stillman.

420
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,399
We need to talk about Paul Shepard.

421
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,799
Yeah, I'll tell you what I told
your detective.

422
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,099
I don't discuss my clients.

423
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,399
I understand, but this is urgent.

424
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,899
I don't care if it's a matter
of national security.

425
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,399
I won't talk without my lawyer.

426
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,099
And don't try to scare me
with some federal BS.

427
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,299
I eat the IRS for breakfast.

428
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,299
Sir, we believe Paul Shepard
is a serial killer,

429
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,599
and you're his next target.

430
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,000
But if you want to take your chances
out there, be my guest.

431
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,000
Must have been hard,

432
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,700
having Paul move in with you.

433
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,500
This 14-year-old
stranger comes to your house.

434
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,000
You got your own son to consider.

435
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,900
We made do.

436
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,700
Smooth sailing from the word go ?

437
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Well, between you and me,

438
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,000
the kid was always half queer.

439
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,100
Rita's blood, not mine.

440
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,400
Queer how ?

441
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,100
Well, never into sports.

442
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,500
Not a lot of friends.

443
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,400
He'd sit and watch movies on the TV,

444
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,200
disappear for days.

445
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,300
Sounds sketchy.

446
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,400
Well, he outgrew it, though.

447
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,300
He turned his obsession
with movies into a living.

448
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,500
And he always looked out
for my son Tom.

449
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,400
They were tight for a long time.

450
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,600
They were tight ?

451
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,300
Always said you don't do business with family.

452
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,500
I've had some setbacks, Tom.

453
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,200
Cash flow. You know how it is.

454
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
You said that last month, month before.

455
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,500
So I want to know when, Paul.

456
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,100
I have partners,

457
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,200
and they won't wait anymore.

458
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,800
So, what ?

459
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,000
You're gonna kick me out ?

460
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,700
It's me, Tom.

461
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,700
I used to baby-sit you,
take you to the movies.

462
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
We're family.

463
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,600
I got my own family
to consider, Paul.

464
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,400
Rosie's pregnant.

465
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,800
Again ?

466
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,190
It's good news, right ?

467
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,760
Yeah. Of course.

468
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,440
I'm sorry. Congratulations.

469
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,890
I'll,um...

470
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,810
I'll find another way out of this.

471
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,470
I'm sorry, Paul.

472
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,290
Yeah. I know you will.

473
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,810
You still own that first store of yours.

474
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,200
Got to be worth something.

475
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,840
I don't know what hurt him worse:

476
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,700
losing the stores or

477
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:21,401
finding out Tom was having
another kid.

478
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,340
You know where your son is now ?

479
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,260
Oh,he was supposed to come
by this afternoon, sunday dinner.

480
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,110
Uh,he should be here now.

481
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,530
Excuse us.

482
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,390
Thank you.

483
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,850
Tom Gleason ?!

484
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,410
Philadelphia Police.

485
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,700
We're coming in, Mr. Gleason.

486
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,840
<i>Tom Gleason dead.</i>

487
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,600
We're going to have to go.

488
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,230
Well, is that about Paul ?

489
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,510
Did you find him?

490
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,770
We'll be in touch.

491
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,310
You'll look out for him, right ?

492
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,540
I don't want to see him get hurt.

493
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,150
Yeah, we'll take care of him,

494
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,890
just like he took care of Barry,

495
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,980
just like he took care
of your son,too.

496
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,370
Tom ?

497
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,020
What do you mean ?

498
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,240
What happened ?

499
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,510
Sweet Paul just put a bullet
between his eyes.

500
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,530
No.

501
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,850
What the hell was that about ?

502
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,720
You'll be all right.

503
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,760
Come on. Let's go inside.

504
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,290
Who's Barry ?

505
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,660
One of our victims.

506
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
No,

507
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:52,461
he's more than that.

508
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,580
Oh, you're so freaking smart ?

509
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,530
You call him Barry; all the others

510
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,210
you call by their last names.

511
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,500
You keep calling him Barry.

512
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,740
- Like you know him.
- I don't need to explain myself.

513
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,740
Yeah, well, I'm done unless you do.

514
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,760
I'm not going down on your sinking ship
till you tell me what's going on.

515
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,420
Look, I was there.

516
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,240
I was 18 years old.

517
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,150
His body just fell into my lap.

518
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,940
Oh, my God !

519
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,410
One day you're a kid
at the movies and...

520
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,080
And then you're not.

521
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,590
Still keeps me up at night.

522
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,790
I mean, why ?

523
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,270
- Why Barry ?
- Well,why not me ?

524
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,570
Why not anybody else there
that night ?

525
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,870
And now he's killing again.

526
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,400
And I am so close.

527
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,410
I'm going to find out
why he murdered Barry...

528
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,820
And I'm gonna pull a bullet in him.

529
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,810
Paul Shepard is out there. Okay.

530
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,630
With a high-powered rifle,
waiting for us to release you.

531
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,460
Hoag's either too stupid to talk
or he's hiding something.

532
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,720
Now,you won't cooperate,

533
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,780
we can't keep you.

534
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,200
He's a dead man walking,
don't even know it.

535
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,920
If I'm so important, you won't let me
out of your sight.

536
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,390
Why protect him ?

537
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,060
Huh, some 

538
00:24:31,361 --> 00:24:32,661
fraternal code,

539
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,960
secret handshake crap ?

540
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,020
I'm just going to wait for my attorney
if it's all the same with you.

541
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,940
Well, it's your funeral, pal.

542
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,370
Come on. Let's go.

543
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,670
Sit down, Kenneth.

544
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,270
Ryan Cavanaugh,

545
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,310
FBI.

546
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,720
I understand you're reluctant
to cooperate.

547
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,120
Protecting your client.

548
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,080
I respect that,but I'm not here
to talk about Paul Shepard.

549
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,340
I'm here to talk about you.

550
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,800
I know everything about you,Kenneth.

551
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,260
Took me no more than an hour
to download your entire life.

552
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,380
You don't scare me.

553
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,160
Those Web sites you frequent ?

554
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,150
You're one sick pup, Kenny.

555
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,710
And then there's the hooker
in Atlantic City five years ago.

556
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,820
Used your company credit card.

557
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,790
Not to mention the inside
trading in the '90s.

558
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,610
That's illegal.

559
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,370
Maybe,

560
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,770
but when your wife and your clients find out,

561
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,970
who's really going to care ?

562
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,810
Tell us about Paul Shepard

563
00:25:25,811 --> 00:25:28,111
and we'll keep this to ourselves.

564
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,270
Absolutely.

565
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,280
We went to school together,

566
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,960
like, a hundred years ago, okay ?

567
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,500
I've been trying to dig
him out of a hole.

568
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,370
He'd been hemorrhaging cash;
he didn't file his tax returns.

569
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,630
Problems with the IRS ?

570
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:42,831
I told him declare bankruptcy,

571
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,590
but he said he was starting a family

572
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,430
and he didn't want to lose his house.

573
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,300
So you tried to help him out.

574
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,210
I felt bad for the guy.

575
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,400
Hooked him up
with an associate of mine,

576
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,430
someone interested in buying
the store...

577
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,980
the guy named Mel Shaver

578
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,439
You know...

579
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,260
You know,when I was a kid,
movies were everything,

580
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,970
more than entertainment.

581
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,500
They were like an escape.

582
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,540
I wanted to share that vision,
and that's The Long View.

583
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:14,520
For 15 years we've been
the premier video store in Philadelphia.

584
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,470
I'd like to think that we're more than
just a business.

585
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,260
We're a beacon for the community,
a refuge.

586
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,840
I can see it's working great.

587
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Yeah, it's been a rough year.

588
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,220
But we've seen tough times before.

589
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,860
We've always bounced back.

590
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,680
People love movies.

591
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,530
There's nothing you offer

592
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,510
I can't get better and cheaper on the Web.

593
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,460
Bottom line :

594
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,930
I want the space,

595
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,331
and I'll take the inventory
and sell it off.

596
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,470
You know, you're wrong
about my business.

597
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,350
People want face-to-face interaction.

598
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,790
They appreciate what we do.

599
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,160
Paul,you seem like a nice guy,
but let's be honest :

600
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,760
nobody cares about that crap.

601
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,410
Not anymore.

602
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,450
<i>"Start a war" by The National.</i>

603
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,660
Now, he said "Nobody cares" ?

604
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,100
Yeah, I thought it was kind of harsh.

605
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,690
You don't hit a guy when he's down.

606
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,230
That's the same words

607
00:27:14,231 --> 00:27:16,331
Bill Shepard's suicide note
ended with.

608
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,330
Why he shot Mel Shaver.

609
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,070
Echoing Paul's father.

610
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,640
Paul ever talk to Shaver again ?

611
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,450
- Why don't you ask Shaver ?
-  Well, he's

612
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,950
a little dead right now.

613
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,230
Yeah.

614
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,260
Paul needed to sell.

615
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,640
He didn't have a choice.

616
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,710
Bled the business dry.

617
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,950
He was writing checks 20 grand at a time.

618
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,600
Company called Lifespring.

619
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,080
You know what that was ?

620
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,420
Fertility clinic.

621
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,980
He couldn't afford the treatments

622
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,540
so he used company money.

623
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,720
Look, Paul was ducking me
when it got bad, okay ?

624
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,910
I had to track him down at this coffee place.

625
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,530
He would sit there all day
at this computer.

626
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,090
Coffee joint got a name?

627
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,330
Alfonso's.

628
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,100
It's just up the block from his video store.

629
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,040
He...

630
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,270
Manager says Paul was a fixture
at Alfonso's.

631
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,980
He was there this morning.

632
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,250
A public computer,

633
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,480
a perfect place to profile
his victims.

634
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,460
Let's see what we got.

635
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,310
Looks like he cleared the browser.

636
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,000
Cleared maybe, erased no.

637
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,170
Credit report, background check,

638
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,640
and a Facebook page for...

639
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,330
Juanita Renaldo.

640
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,510
- His next victim ?
- According to Facebook,

641
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,930
she works at Lifespring Fertility.

642
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,760
- You got a number for her ?
- Yeah.

643
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,920
Juanita Renaldo ?

644
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,490
My name's Detective Rush,
Philadelphia Police.

645
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,240
I need to know where she is now.

646
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,990
Map and train schedule.

647
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,410
Today ?

648
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,480
All right,thank you.

649
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,460
Juanita Renaldo has been out of town--

650
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,980
yoga retreat, comes back today.

651
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,670
On a train into 30th Street Station.

652
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,710
There she is.

653
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,910
We've got her. Bring the van around.

654
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,290
Juanita Renaldo, 

655
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:26,691
you need to come with us now.

656
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,710
What's going on ?

657
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,650
- We don't have time to explain.
- We got to move.

658
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,110
I don't understand.

659
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,830
Oh! You understand now ?

660
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,340
He's heading to the subway.

661
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,470
Got him.

662
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,580
Cavanaugh.

663
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,230
You move a muscle

664
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,010
and I'll blow your frigging head off.

665
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,140
I don't get it.

666
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,720
Who'd want to kill me ?

667
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,980
You recognize the name
Claire Shepard ?

668
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,350
She's been a patient at the clinic
for a couple years.

669
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,010
Her husband Paul.

670
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,520
Oh, God, this guy ?

671
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,460
Did something happen between you ?

672
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,120
I was just trying to help him.

673
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,500
I'm sorry. This is declined,too.

674
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,870
Well, it must be some sort of mistake.

675
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,380
I'm sure it is.

676
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,970
Well, could you maybe try splitting it

677
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,260
across a couple of these ?

678
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,180
I-I can't do that,sir.

679
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,630
Please,y-you have to help me.

680
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,340
My wife and I have been coming here for months.

681
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,050
We've tried and tried.

682
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,990
Don't turn us away.

683
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,670
Dr. Shandir sponsors
these experimental trials.

684
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,540
It's an option if you can't afford
the cycle.

685
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:57,641
I can afford it.

686
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,870
I've been affording it.
It just hasn't worked !

687
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,250
Please don't raise your voice to me.

688
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,040
I'm just trying to help.

689
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,900
Is there a problem, Paul ?

690
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,490
No, no, no, sweetheart.

691
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,990
There's no problem.

692
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,470
Right ?

693
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,850
Sir, just take the card and go h he.

694
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,650
Come on, sweetie.

695
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,040
A lot of people come through
that clinic.

696
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,440
It was sad.

697
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,010
Guy really wanted a child.

698
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,000
What about the experimental trial ?

699
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,690
Supposed to start last month.

700
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,030
He calls up and cancels just before.

701
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,160
I told him he couldn't get
back in the program

702
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,650
if he changed his mind.

703
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,820
Did he threaten you ?

704
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,720
No.

705
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,440
Just said it didn't matter.

706
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,450
Nobody cared anyway.

707
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,580
So Juanita was supposed
to be target #4,

708
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,330
just like Fred Norris,

709
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,890
who pitied his father.

710
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,170
But he failed.

711
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,110
Juanita's in protective custody.

712
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,990
So what's his next move ?

713
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,260
Take himself out, just like Dad.

714
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,170
What's Bill say to his son
in that note ?

715
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,450
"To my son Paul,

716
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,780
I'm sorry I'm too weak
to take you with me."

717
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,920
I keep thinking about what Claire said,

718
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,410
that Paul would never leave her behind.

719
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,840
All he ever wanted was a family.

720
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,810
He was willing to give up his business
if it meant having a child.

721
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,790
But he cancels his appointments
at the fertility clinic.

722
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,090
"Nobody cares."

723
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,100
Yeah, he's done.

724
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,350
He's gonna take himself out
and take Claire with him.

725
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,290
No answer at Claire's house.

726
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,970
Agent's not responding either.

727
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,250
Paul is already there.

728
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,600
Officer down.

729
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,550
Shots fired.

730
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,680
<i>I think you can understand me,
though.</i>

731
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,570
<i>I think, behind your eyes,
you're...</i>

732
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,760
<i>you're just as alert as ever...</i>

733
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,840
They're going to say things that aren't fair.

734
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,590
Blow them out of proportion.

735
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,430
But you know me.

736
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,800
You've always known me.

737
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,370
So, why do you want to work here ?

738
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,860
The hours are long.
We don't pay very well.

739
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,120
The boss is a stickler.

740
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,540
I like movies.

741
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,080
Who doesn't ?

742
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,020
I get lost in movies.

743
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,220
It's like...

744
00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:58,121
dreaming while you're awake.

745
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,160
I don't know. I just wanted
to be closer to it.

746
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,310
I get that.

747
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,940
<i>East of Eden.</i>

748
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,940
Oh, yeah.

749
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,830
- You like it ?
- Yeah.

750
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,690
Not bad for a melodrama.

751
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,930
Well, it's a little more
than a melodrama.

752
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,080
That's debatable.

753
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,190
Not really.

754
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,680
I mean, it's Steinbeck.

755
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,710
Okay, smart man.

756
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,410
Convince me.

757
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,860
<i>"Crash into me"
par Dave Matthews Band.</i>

758
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,150
What you said about the movies,
about living in a dream,

759
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:42,130
that's how you've made me feel all these years.

760
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:43,770
Paul,

761
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,320
- please...
- Shh.

762
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,210
<i>Excuse me, Mr. Trask...</i>

763
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,530
This part's great.

764
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,670
<i>for daring to speak to you
this way, but...</i>

765
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,670
It's awful not to be loved.

766
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,540
"It's the worst thing in the world.

767
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,040
"It makes you mean and violent

768
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,020
and cruel."

769
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,420
<i>And that's the way Cal
has always felt...</i>

770
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,300
We're in the middle of something here.

771
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,620
Put the gun down.

772
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,480
You know that's not going to happen.

773
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,970
How you doing, Claire ?

774
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,750
You hanging in there ?

775
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,640
Yeah.

776
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,770
You hear that, Paul ?

777
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,970
You're terrifying your wife.

778
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,940
Why don't you be a good husband
and let her go ?

779
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,710
It'll be over soon.

780
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,130
Is that the master plan ?

781
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,970
Eat a bullet, just like your father ?

782
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,440
My father built something,

783
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,660
and it was ripped from his hands.

784
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:27,820
I just tried to correct

785
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,130
the mistakes of the past.

786
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,310
- Murdering all those people...
- Tying up his loose ends,

787
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,860
balancing the books.

788
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,330
But it didn't matter.

789
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,760
Your father's not a touchstone, Paul.

790
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,800
He was bad in business,
and he blamed everyone else.

791
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,230
He could have tried again.

792
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,520
He could have made an effort--
for his son.

793
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,380
You think I don't know that ?

794
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,890
The man shot himself 30 yards
from me.

795
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,160
You see his note ?

796
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,020
It said : "Nobody cares."

797
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,810
But I cared.

798
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,110
Why couldn't he see that ?

799
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,390
Like...

800
00:36:04,091 --> 00:36:05,891
like I didn't even matter.

801
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,100
I mean, every step of the way,

802
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,510
I just tried to build something
that would last.

803
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,890
He had the drive-in,

804
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,760
so you got the video stores
to prove him wrong.

805
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,830
But it ends the same.

806
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,040
Easy, now, Paul...

807
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,630
45 years old, and I'm every inch
the failure he was.

808
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,800
You're wrong.

809
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,090
You've got something he never had.

810
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,950
You've got a real family.

811
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,670
You've got a beautiful wife

812
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,660
sitting there right next to you.

813
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,430
You've got a child.

814
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,340
Juanita from the fertility clinic...

815
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,480
that's what she told us.

816
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,780
Claire here is pregnant.

817
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,170
How ?

818
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,920
Experimental treatments.

819
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,910
You canceled the appointment...

820
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,220
Claire went anyway.

821
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,850
Claire ?

822
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:57,851
I...

823
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,510
I just really wanted
to make you happy.

824
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,700
You should have told me.

825
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,710
I was waiting until I knew it was for sure.

826
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,640
"Man has a choice, and it's...

827
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,680
the choice is what makes him a man."

828
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,950
That's right.

829
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,810
All right.

830
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,290
Sending Claire up !

831
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,070
He's secure.

832
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,110
I don't care.

833
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,390
What are you doing ?

834
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,600
I want to know why.

835
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,990
Why did Barry Jensen have to die ?

836
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,580
Why do you care ?

837
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,900
I'm the one who was with him.

838
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,760
Oh, yeah.

839
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,270
I remember you.

840
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,780
Your phone number, right ?

841
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,040
Well,if you didn't care about
that guy before I shot him,

842
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,070
- why do you care now ?
- We were kids.

843
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,920
He didn't deserve it. Now,
I want an answer : why ?

844
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,220
Take it from me.

845
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,490
Answers...

846
00:38:50,691 --> 00:38:51,891
they're overrated.

847
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,850
- I want an answer !
- Diane, don't do this.

848
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,190
- He's not worth it.
- Don't you get high and mighty with me.

849
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,100
Roles reversed,you'd do the same.

850
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,090
What do you prove by shooting him?

851
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,140
He's got nothing to lose.

852
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,410
Except my child, right ?

853
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:02,960
Nothing to lose

854
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,460
except my unborn child.

855
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,950
Claire isn't pregnant.

856
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,360
It's a lie.

857
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,210
- Go ahead. Shoot me.
- You pull that trigger,

858
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,300
- and you're doing him a favor.
That's all you'll accomplish. / - Shoot.

859
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,920
I've waited 30 years to find out

860
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:25,221
why that kid died in my lap.

861
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,200
Now,you're going to tell me,

862
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,590
and in exchange for that,

863
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,460
I'm going to give you what you want:

864
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,100
end your miserable life.
Is that a deal ?

865
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,250
- Diane, we are not...
- This is happening,Detective,

866
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,480
whether you like it or not.

867
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,630
I had to prove him wrong.

868
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,270
Barry? My father.

869
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,350
Said he was nothing when he died.

870
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,530
Less than nothing.

871
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,860
But to me,

872
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,930
he was everything.

873
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,150
Barry didn't know your father.

874
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,260
He wasn't paying attention to the movie.

875
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,150
Just wanted to get inside your pants.

876
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,360
Would have been fine any other day.

877
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,890
But they were playing "East of Eden"
that night.

878
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,810
And your boyfriend...

879
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,800
just didn't get it.

880
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,780
Man,I'm telling you,she's good to go.

881
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,230
I got the peach schnapps,couple ludes.

882
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,070
Tonight's the night.

883
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:18,960
Excuse me.

884
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,610
Just need a small popcorn.

885
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,970
Easy, little man.

886
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,480
Anyway, she's waiting for me.

887
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,630
- Come on. Movie's about to start.
- Dude, so what ?

888
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,600
It's "East of Eden".

889
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,480
It's a classic.

890
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,940
Yeah, if you say so.

891
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,980
They've played it every year since this theater opened.

892
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,080
Kid, look around you.

893
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,990
No one's here to see the movie.

894
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,870
You need to see a movie,go to the cineplex.

895
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,400
Nobody here cares.

896
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,170
Nobody cares.
