00:00:05,321 --> 00:00:07,987
********

00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,524
<i>"Light my fire" by The Doors.</i>

4
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:27,181
Step right up !

5
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:29,182
Step right up,
boys and girls of all ages

6
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:32,883
for the final act
of our big top extravaganza !

7
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:39,144
Let's hear it one more time

8
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:41,743
for Zelda, Queen of Knives !

9
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:45,647
And now, City of Brotherly Love,

10
00:00:45,818 --> 00:00:48,518
birthplace of the American circus,

11
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:50,522
let me introduce to you

12
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:54,057
our headliner,
the Human Butterfly,

13
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:58,028
Mia Romanov and her
magical metamorphosis !

14
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:00,412
Well, boss, you wanted to see me ?

15
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:02,047
Sit down.

16
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:11,089
Moe kitchener.

17
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:13,824
- What about him ?
- He got shot last night,

18
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:15,660
outside a bar over in Roxborough.

19
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:19,364
- You're serious ?
- Large caliber slug,

20
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:20,632
Back of the head.

21
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:25,237
So... he's dead ?

22
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,205
Where were you last night, Lil ?

23
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:30,074
Home. I was finishing up
a report.

24
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,543
You're going to need
someone to confirm that.

25
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,647
Who the investigating detective ?

26
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,649
Doherty wants the state
police to handle it.

27
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,622
They're gonna want to talk to you.

28
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,506
You all right ?

29
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,275
I don't know.

30
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,442
Listen, I told the boss

31
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:06,378
if anyone wants to know,
you were home when I

32
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:07,879
dropped off that file last night.

33
00:03:07,913 --> 00:03:08,947
- The file...?
- Yeah.

34
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,615
Rodriguez file, '06.

35
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,351
No way you could've been across town
when Moe caught one

36
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:15,686
outside that bar.

37
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,089
Yeah.

38
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:19,690
Thanks.

39
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,862
Listen, I got a lady
waiting on a case.

40
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:25,296
I'll handle it.

41
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,932
I want to...

42
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:28,833
keep working.

43
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:36,942
Detectives Valens. Rush.

44
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:38,510
You got something on an old

45
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:40,111
Homicide, Miss Deluca ?

46
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:41,379
Mia Romanov.

47
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:43,614
An aerialist for the
Jones brothers circus.

48
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:44,683
The circus ?

49
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:46,718
Her death was ruled
an accidental fall

50
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:48,019
in 1971.

51
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:49,454
You're saying it wasn't ?

52
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:50,722
Mia did a silk act where

53
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:53,424
she came out of a cocoon
high above the rafters.

54
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,260
I knew something was wrong
the moment she came out.

55
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,064
This a bad time ?

56
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:01,466
What ?

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,570
No.

58
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:05,471
You were there
the night of her fall ?

59
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,339
My mother worked
at Jones brothers circus.

60
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:09,040
She was a fortune-teller.

61
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:10,542
I'm a psychic.

62
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:13,544
Always felt Mia's "accident"
was anything but.

63
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:15,880
Then just tell us
who you "feel" killed her,

64
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:17,782
and we'll clear this up
by lunchtime.

65
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:20,318
Doesn't work that way.

66
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:21,886
Yeah, it never does.

67
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:24,489
Always wondered how
Mia could've fallen.

68
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:26,891
And then I found
these at an exhibit,

69
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:28,159
"Death under the big top."

70
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:30,294
Photographs of various tragic falls,

71
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:31,795
including Mia's.

72
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:34,363
You can see how the other performers
braced for impact.

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,234
- Mia didn't.
- Fell head first.

74
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:38,570
Arms limp, hands at her side.

75
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:40,005
Might've been unconscious.

76
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:41,206
Or already dead.

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,908
You think that her fall
was some kind of cover-up ?

78
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:45,710
Mia grew up in the circus.

79
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,245
Had the agility of a cat.

80
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,680
Something wasn't right.

81
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:49,781
I felt it.

82
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:51,549
Yeah, we got that.

83
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,451
We'll be in touch, Isabel.

84
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:57,288
Your mother
will be fine.

85
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:01,327
You...

86
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:03,428
I'm not so sure.

87
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:13,237
Cold Case
Season 7 Episode

88
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:38,634
Metamorphosis

89
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:43,468
Mia Romanov, 18.

90
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:46,672
Died in St. Mary's fairgrounds
in '71, ruled accidental.

91
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:47,873
More like inevitable.

92
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:49,842
Flying through the air
on nothing but silk ?

93
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:51,444
Not much here by the
way of statements.

94
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:53,745
Well, getting circus
folk to talk isn't easy.

95
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,881
Finally got warrants,
you're looking at an empty lot.

96
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:57,849
Assigned spoke to a few
audience members.

97
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:00,353
Said Mia looked fine
giving her pre-act bow.

98
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:02,055
So whatever happened to her,
happened backstage.

99
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:04,523
It's got the stink of
sabotage all over it.

100
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:06,458
A/v blew up the
picture of Mia's fall.

101
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,561
ME said the shadow around
her nose and mouth

102
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:10,462
- could be blood.
- Before impact.

103
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:13,131
Autopsy report : Broken neck,
shattered skull...

104
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,366
Thought to have been
caused by the fall,

105
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:17,069
but hands and wrists only
suffered minor damage.

106
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:18,470
She didn't brace for impact.

107
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,072
Survival instinct never kicked in.

108
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:21,574
Run all the performers for priors,

109
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:23,642
anything else we can
dig up on this big top.

110
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:26,712
Mia was legally adopted
by Sheldon Burgess,

111
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:28,480
aka Cleo the clown.

112
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:29,514
Never gave a statement.

113
00:06:29,549 --> 00:06:31,416
Got an address over
in Point Breeze.

114
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,985
Well, go talk to this clown.

115
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:44,763
Mr. Burgess ?

116
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:46,865
Welcome to Cleo's fun house.

117
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:48,033
What can I do for you ?

118
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,069
Homicide. We're looking

119
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:52,137
into the death of Mia Romanov.

120
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:53,973
Mia ?

121
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:56,642
All these years later ?

122
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:59,010
What can you tell us about her fall ?

123
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,713
She was trying a new stunt.

124
00:07:03,016 --> 00:07:04,450
It's the worst night of my life.

125
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:07,686
How come you didn't give
a statement, Mr. Burgess ?

126
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,656
I climbed deep into
a bottle that night.

127
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,157
Stayed there for a long time after.

128
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:14,760
It never crossed your mind that
maybe it wasn't an accident ?

129
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:16,395
Silks weren't cut or frayed.

130
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,864
Thought the moment
got the best of her.

131
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:21,600
So who was in charge of
sending up her cocoon ?

132
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:23,135
Gaucho, day players,
in and out.

133
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,271
But Mia did her own rigging.

134
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:28,374
She was stubborn, like her father.

135
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:29,542
Her father ?

136
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:34,180
The Romanovs have been
kicking the sawdust

137
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:36,515
For five generations.

138
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:40,486
They were royalty
amongst us kinkers.

139
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,054
And mia was like her folks:

140
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:45,023
More comfortable in the
air than on terra firma.

141
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:48,059
How does a clown in
a traveling circus

142
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,428
adopt a little girl ?

143
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:50,996
I was her godfather.

144
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,899
Her parents willed her to me,
but the circus raised her.

145
00:07:54,134 --> 00:07:56,770
Jones brothers was
a one-ring mud show,

146
00:07:56,771 --> 00:07:57,871
but we were family.

147
00:07:57,904 --> 00:08:00,072
- Anyone backstage with her ?
- The act before hers,

148
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:02,475
Zelda "the queen of knives" panay.

149
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,976
Zelda and Mia get on all right ?

150
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:07,580
Oh, sure. Long as zelda
was the headliner.

151
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:11,350
What the hell was that tonight ?

152
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:14,019
Williamsport ?
Used to pack 'em to the stingers.

153
00:08:14,054 --> 00:08:15,989
Now, we're lucky to be making horse feed
out there.

154
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,190
You still getting paid, Cleo ?

155
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:19,224
This dog and pony
show is dying, Biggie.

156
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:21,894
- We need an aerial act.
- Can't afford one.

157
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:23,730
Unless you got one
in that wig of yours.

158
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:25,631
No way a knife-thrower
can carry the big top.

159
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:27,132
- Excuse me ?
- No offense, zelda.

160
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:28,134
- I've been...
- Stop it.

161
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:30,603
Everybody, please, just...

162
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:34,740
I ca... I can give
us an aerial act.

163
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:36,375
Mia, I didn't mean you should...

164
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,376
I can fly.

165
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,744
It's in my blood.

166
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:40,646
She's a baby.

167
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,347
Well, what do we got to lose?

168
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:44,383
Even a baby can see we're dying.

169
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,888
I'll talk to management.

170
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:50,523
Start putting it together, kid.

171
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:54,760
- I don't know, Mia.
- It's going to be fine, cleo.

172
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:03,202
Accidents happen.

173
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,108
Zelda P-A-N-A-Y...

174
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:11,610
Was the headliner prior to Mia ?

175
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:13,612
Yeah, ever since the
last aerial act walked.

176
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:15,647
I didn't want Mia up there.

177
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:18,384
Hate to think I put
a target on her.

178
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:21,286
Sounds like zelda wasn't
ready to put her knives away.

179
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,059
- Thanks for coming in.
- Well, if I'd known

180
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:28,360
you were so handsome,

181
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:31,563
I would've sprinted
all the way from Atlantic City.

182
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:34,298
I don't mean to be rude,

183
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:36,400
but can we get going on this,

184
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:38,637
because... I got a show, at 6:00.

185
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:40,439
- Still performing ?
- Yeah, well, it's mostly

186
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:42,474
blue plate dinners for seniors.

187
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:45,678
But they remember me from
the Ed Sullivan Show.

188
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:48,079
How did you and Mia
romanov get along ?

189
00:09:48,514 --> 00:09:50,115
Mia Romanov ?

190
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:53,285
Fine.

191
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:54,787
I took her under my wing.

192
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:56,488
She was like my sister.

193
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:58,657
You always throw daggers
at family ?

194
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,693
Darling...

195
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:04,462
even a lady loses
her cool sometimes,

196
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:07,800
Which accounts for three
out of four of my divorces.

197
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:10,335
Foolish. Jealous.

198
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:12,103
Jealous enough to get rid of her ?

199
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:13,472
What do you mean ?

200
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:15,341
She fell.

201
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:17,542
I was there.

202
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:19,745
With her backstage before her act.

203
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:21,580
Your "sister" ends up dead

204
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:23,582
And you get to keep your spotlight.

205
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:25,417
Now, I got my pride.

206
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:27,920
But I'm not stupid.

207
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,088
We needed mia's act to work.

208
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:33,258
It was all over, for all of us.

209
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:39,598
<i>"Waiting for the sun"
by The Doors.</i>

210
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,134
- Where's the trapeze bar ?
- Forget the trapeze.

211
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:46,371
Biggie, we need something new.
We need dramatic.

212
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:47,339
You'll never be ready in a week

213
00:10:47,374 --> 00:10:48,607
Trying to get a new act together.

214
00:10:48,642 --> 00:10:50,009
Just do what your folks taught you.

215
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:51,610
I need a theme.

216
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:53,078
To tell a story.

217
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:55,381
- I need some time.
- You're not a clown anymore.

218
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:58,149
It's not about stories.
It's about wowing them.

219
00:10:58,184 --> 00:10:59,785
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.
There's something

220
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:01,720
Groovy with the silks-
the freedom it gives me...

221
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:02,821
People don't want groovy.

222
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:04,356
They want tradition.

223
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,592
For their kids to see
and feel what they did.

224
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:08,294
Maybe we can start a new one.

225
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:10,696
You know, we can capture
their imagination. Great.

226
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,731
Then imagine there's no
circus when we get shut down

227
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:15,467
waiting for you to get
your act together.

228
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:17,001
Now this is all on me ?

229
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:19,471
You asked for a shot, kid,
and I gave it to you.

230
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:21,140
Convinced management
to roll the dice.

231
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:24,043
- Don't hang me out to dry.
- No, I'll do the silk act.

232
00:11:24,077 --> 00:11:25,644
I'll use a mechanic if I have to.
The advance men

233
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,746
have been pumping your
act as death-defying.

234
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:29,214
- But I...
- But nothing !

235
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:32,318
I took a flyer on you.

236
00:11:32,352 --> 00:11:35,721
You'd better not make a fool of me.

237
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:45,431
Mia was way ahead of the curve.

238
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:48,967
She was cirque du
soleil before they were.

239
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:51,904
Now everybody's got a silk act.

240
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:53,639
What about David and Goliath ?

241
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:55,908
Ringmaster Biggie Jones
and his goon,

242
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:58,710
Lester "Gargantuan" Smith.

243
00:11:59,812 --> 00:12:01,380
Biggie pushed us hard.

244
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:04,483
Maybe pushed Mia too hard.

245
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:07,919
That's probably why he
pulled up stakes so fast

246
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:09,387
and left town that night.

247
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,159
You see Biggie backstage
with Mia before her fall ?

248
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:16,428
Biggie always checked
on the featured acts

249
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:18,597
before they went on.

250
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:22,801
Have information that you called in

251
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,470
the 10-37 last week.

252
00:12:24,505 --> 00:12:27,172
DUI check on Mr. Kitchener ?

253
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:28,707
That's right.

254
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:30,709
Outside the same bar
that he was murdered ?

255
00:12:30,743 --> 00:12:33,912
- The suspect was inebriated.
- Suspect was awaiting trial.

256
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:36,248
And what were you doing
observing him in the first place ?

257
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:37,983
It was a continuing investigation.

258
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:40,452
He had already filed a
complaint against you.

259
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:42,088
Which was completely bogus,

260
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:43,289
same as this.

261
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:45,991
Were you outside that bar
last night, detective ?

262
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:49,695
No.

263
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:52,898
You testified Moe kitchener
tried to kill you.

264
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:54,633
You believe that.

265
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,568
So does the commonwealth.

266
00:12:57,603 --> 00:12:59,238
Maybe you should talk to the da.

267
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:02,507
Said you were home last night
between the hours of 9:25

268
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:03,809
And 10:10?

269
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:05,143
That's right.

270
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:07,212
Anyone who can confirm that ?

271
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:10,882
My partner, Scotty Valens.

272
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:13,151
He came by,
dropped off some paperwork

273
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:14,619
on a case I was reviewing.

274
00:13:14,654 --> 00:13:16,088
What case ?

275
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:18,624
Cesar Rodriguez.

276
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:20,693
The file's on my desk.

277
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:29,101
Bunch of gink squad bs.

278
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:32,370
I need you to surrender

279
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:33,705
- Your service weapon.
- What ?

280
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:38,410
Until this thing blows over,
you're on restricted duty.

281
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:51,124
Mia Romanov.

282
00:13:51,558 --> 00:13:53,393
A real tragedy, that one.

283
00:13:53,427 --> 00:13:55,061
Understand you checked on your acts

284
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:56,863
- before they hit the stage.
- So how'd she look

285
00:13:56,897 --> 00:13:58,831
- before going out ?
- Ready to fly.

286
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:00,667
- Girl was good to go.
- You're saying

287
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:01,901
She looked good, Biggie,

288
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:03,836
- Ready to fly ?
- You whizzing

289
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:06,172
on the wrong hydrant there,
kemosabe.

290
00:14:06,206 --> 00:14:08,508
I needed that girl.

291
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:11,578
Without her act I lost my main
moneymaker,

292
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:12,979
lost the midway.

293
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:14,480
Lost that,

294
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:16,882
Lost the circus.

295
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:18,651
Then why the cover-up ?

296
00:14:18,686 --> 00:14:20,987
You pulled up stakes
before sunup, hit the road.

297
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:22,822
Now, hold your horses.

298
00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:25,692
We had a long haul the
next day to Allentown.

299
00:14:25,726 --> 00:14:26,859
The show must go on, huh?

300
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:29,262
Well, we was feeding
a lot of people.

301
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:32,131
My family survived the ten-in-one

302
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,067
to turn around and own this circus.

303
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:35,301
Ten-in-ones ?

304
00:14:36,203 --> 00:14:38,504
Ten freaks in one tent.

305
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:41,040
It was humiliating.

306
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:45,244
For three generations we fought
off larger predatory circuses.

307
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,446
Ringling.

308
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,047
And you banked everything on Mia,

309
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:49,382
but she crossed you up.

310
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,416
We were family.

311
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:51,851
Wouldn't sell.

312
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:55,054
Loyal. We circled the tents
around Mia.

313
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:57,523
But Mia stepped out of line,
made her own act, didn't she ?

314
00:14:57,558 --> 00:14:59,225
She make a fool out of you, Biggie ?

315
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:00,893
Wrong.

316
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:02,996
I was on board with her act.

317
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,099
Hell, I had to be;
times was desperate.

318
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:08,134
I helped her set
the whole thing up.

319
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:15,341
You heard of knocking ?

320
00:15:15,376 --> 00:15:17,110
Peace offering.

321
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:18,244
Thought about what you said--

322
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:20,146
Wanting a story for your act.

323
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,280
How about this ?

324
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:24,584
Silk worm goes up into her cocoon

325
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:27,920
To emerge as the human butterfly.

326
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:31,390
Call it the metamorphosis.

327
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:34,660
<i>"Love her madly" by The Doors.</i>

328
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:37,797
I don't know what to say.

329
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:39,369
Biggie, that's...

330
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,370
perfect.

331
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:42,971
So are you, kid.

332
00:15:43,003 --> 00:15:45,371
We're all behind you here.
You're the best we got.

333
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:46,705
I'll be ready for philly.

334
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,641
And no mechanic or safety harness.

335
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:50,843
Knock 'em dead, kid.

336
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:54,414
I got an act, lester.

337
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:56,115
I'm the human butterfly.

338
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:05,925
Management had

339
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,761
Them tack spitters wallpaper
the town with that bill.

340
00:16:08,796 --> 00:16:10,797
She was our homegrown star.

341
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:12,098
And who was management ?

342
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:15,101
J.B. Ricketts investment.

343
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:18,104
Bunch of suits out of Florida,

344
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:19,906
helped us through the lean years.

345
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,007
Got a number ?

346
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:23,109
No, ma'am,

347
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:25,645
that was a long time ago.

348
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,979
What about this Paul Bunyan ?

349
00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:29,115
- He have a thing for Mia ?
- Gargantuan ?

350
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:32,185
I don't think he was wired
that way.

351
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:34,989
His feelings were simple,

352
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,790
childlike.

353
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:38,825
With big boy plumbing.
That's reassuring.

354
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:41,527
- Some kind of condition ?
- Cerebral gigantism.

355
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:45,098
Made him huge.

356
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:48,034
Also made him about as sharp
as a bowling ball.

357
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:50,103
So what beanstalk is he up
right now ?

358
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:51,571
I haven't seen him in years.

359
00:16:51,605 --> 00:16:52,538
He's probably dead.

360
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:54,107
Giants don't last too long.

361
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:56,509
Heart can't take it.

362
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,377
Excuse me,

363
00:16:58,511 --> 00:17:01,481
I'd like to talk
to a detective Rush.

364
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:10,257
Mr. Butler.

365
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:12,725
What can I do for you ?

366
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,761
I want to make a statement.

367
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:20,466
Would you like a lawyer
present, Mr. Butler ?

368
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,834
I would not.

369
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:24,037
I recommend you get one, Hank.

370
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:25,972
All you've been through.

371
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:31,444
My wife doesn't eat anymore.

372
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:34,714
She doesn't sleep.

373
00:17:35,082 --> 00:17:36,983
She just cries.

374
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:41,521
Do you want to tell us
what happened, Hank ?

375
00:17:48,028 --> 00:17:51,397
When I saw him at the
courthouse, I knew.

376
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:54,333
Moe Kitchener ?

377
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:56,769
Ten, 20 years... didn't matter.

378
00:17:57,905 --> 00:17:59,805
It wouldn't go away.

379
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,874
I couldn't go on

380
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:03,910
thinking that that
smug son of a bitch

381
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:05,545
was walking the earth.

382
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,251
Someone had to put that dog down.

383
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:29,468
Hank.

384
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:33,072
- Listen, Hank, I didn't kill your daughter.
- Shut up.

385
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:35,541
You buried her in a box.

386
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:37,343
You'd have let me twist forever.

387
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:41,414
Sorry, Hank. It wasn't personal.

388
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:47,220
I'm sorry, too.

389
00:18:52,326 --> 00:18:54,127
I went home.

390
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:03,002
I thought I'd feel better.

391
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:07,106
Katie's gone.

392
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,147
Nothing's ever going
to change that.

393
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:31,631
What do you want ?

394
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:34,600
What do you want ?

395
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:35,935
Leave me alone. You hear me ?!

396
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:37,903
I seen you standing here.

397
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:41,407
I'm a cop.

398
00:19:47,414 --> 00:19:48,981
I'm sorry.

399
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:50,082
Police.

400
00:19:50,117 --> 00:19:51,417
I didn't know !

401
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:52,752
I didn't know !

402
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:54,787
I didn't know !

403
00:20:03,597 --> 00:20:06,499
People paint on my wall,

404
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:09,769
break my windows...

405
00:20:09,803 --> 00:20:11,904
I thought you was one of 'em.

406
00:20:11,938 --> 00:20:13,372
Gonna hurt me.

407
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:16,275
You thought I was gonna hurt you, Gargantua ?

408
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,677
Lot of performers at Jones brothers

409
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:19,111
had priors, Lester.

410
00:20:19,146 --> 00:20:20,946
You're the only one with
a history of violence.

411
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:22,848
In and out of institutions
as a kid.

412
00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:26,151
Beat a grown man within an inch
of his life at the age of 13.

413
00:20:27,454 --> 00:20:29,855
He attacked me,

414
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,591
'cause I was big.

415
00:20:32,626 --> 00:20:34,160
What about Mia Romanov ?

416
00:20:37,463 --> 00:20:39,265
Yeah, you...
remember her, right ?

417
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,668
Yes. Mia.

418
00:20:42,903 --> 00:20:44,670
You liked her ?

419
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:45,938
Pretty. Soft.

420
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:47,807
She smelled nice.

421
00:20:49,142 --> 00:20:51,043
She just wasn't into the whole
beauty and the beast thing.

422
00:20:51,078 --> 00:20:53,512
So you squeezed her too hard,

423
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:54,913
like you did to me.

424
00:20:54,915 --> 00:20:56,482
No !

425
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:58,651
Mia was special.

426
00:20:58,685 --> 00:21:01,654
- "special" ?
- Friend.

427
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:03,622
She was my friend.

428
00:21:03,657 --> 00:21:06,390
I could never hurt her.

429
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:08,894
Well, someone did
hHurt your friend, Lester.

430
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:10,529
Someone backstage.

431
00:21:10,564 --> 00:21:12,531
And then they dropped
her from the ceiling.

432
00:21:20,674 --> 00:21:21,807
There was this

433
00:21:21,842 --> 00:21:23,809
gaucho.

434
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:29,448
<i>"Wild child" by The Doors.</i>

435
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:32,818
Hey.

436
00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:35,388
- Eddie, right ?
- That's right, darlin'.

437
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:36,589
I haven't checked my rig yet.

438
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:38,524
It's looking fine to me.

439
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:39,625
Get rid of that Karabiner

440
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:40,893
and mount it on a swivel.

441
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:42,061
Karabiner's twice

442
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:43,396
as strong as a swivel.

443
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,097
What do I look like,
some first of may ?

444
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:47,533
That swivel's going to let
me get out over the audience.

445
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,001
Now, lose the Karabiner.

446
00:21:49,903 --> 00:21:51,203
Looks like you're

447
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:52,805
calling the shots
around here, huh, kid?

448
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,341
How long you been doing this, Eddie ?

449
00:21:54,342 --> 00:21:55,242
Ten years experience.

450
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:58,077
Rigged every big rock and roll
show from Vancouver to Miami.

451
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:00,045
Then you should know a performer
needs to check their rig

452
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,580
before it's flown.

453
00:22:03,183 --> 00:22:04,650
How old are you, sweet cheeks ?

454
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:07,086
- Old enough.
Are you hopped up, Eddie ?

455
00:22:08,888 --> 00:22:11,458
I'm the one
50 feet in the air.

456
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:14,693
You gonna be on that junk, you can
stay away from me and my rig.

457
00:22:16,363 --> 00:22:18,230
I want you out of my tent. Now !

458
00:22:18,365 --> 00:22:20,433
Get out. Or I'll
have you dragged out.

459
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:23,068
All right, look.
Easy, big fella, easy.

460
00:22:23,103 --> 00:22:25,004
All right, I dig it.

461
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:26,605
If that's what the
little lady wants.

462
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:34,079
Now that would hurt.

463
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:42,354
Eddie wasn't one of us.

464
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:44,990
Not circus folk.

465
00:22:47,727 --> 00:22:50,396
He poisoned her.

466
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,431
You mean with drugs ?

467
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:53,966
Was he selling to the crew ?

468
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,534
This rigger,

469
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:57,770
He responsible for putting
mia's cocoon in the air?

470
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,707
Till she kicked him
out of the big top.

471
00:23:05,345 --> 00:23:09,515
They made him shovel
after the elephants.

472
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:11,784
Eddie left

473
00:23:11,818 --> 00:23:15,821
after Mia...

474
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:18,324
fell.

475
00:23:29,002 --> 00:23:30,202
I went to Jones.

476
00:23:30,237 --> 00:23:31,904
The bartender said
you took Nick home.

477
00:23:31,938 --> 00:23:34,206
Yeah. He was plastered
by the time I got there.

478
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:35,374
Something's up with him.

479
00:23:35,408 --> 00:23:36,709
Lot of that going around.

480
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:39,512
Still thirsty ?

481
00:23:41,414 --> 00:23:44,049
I heard about your dance
with Gargantuan.

482
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:47,453
Had him right where I wanted him.

483
00:23:47,487 --> 00:23:49,488
Yeah.

484
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:51,490
You ring him up for assault ?

485
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:53,859
Guy belongs in the
puzzle house, not county.

486
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:56,128
Punks were harassing him.

487
00:23:56,162 --> 00:23:58,197
Tagged "freak" on his building.

488
00:23:58,231 --> 00:23:59,665
Cruel world.

489
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,633
I filed three separate
police reports.

490
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:04,804
He was just
protecting himself.

491
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,277
- I'm sorry I wasn't there.
- Almost...

492
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:13,579
Lit him up, Lil.

493
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:15,814
Wanted to.

494
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:17,085
Thanks for...

495
00:24:17,986 --> 00:24:19,386
having my back.

496
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:20,786
With Moe.

497
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,288
The alibi.

498
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:24,523
Partners, right ?

499
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:27,026
Yeah.

500
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:33,732
I still can't believe it.

501
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,868
What hank did. Just beat you to it.

502
00:24:35,902 --> 00:24:38,103
So what does that make me ?

503
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:40,773
Human.

504
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:43,809
- Protect and serve, right ?
- The innocent.

505
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:45,778
Lil.

506
00:24:47,013 --> 00:24:49,281
Need more Hanks out there.

507
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:52,117
The guy deserves a medal.

508
00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:53,686
You believe that ?

509
00:24:56,356 --> 00:24:57,990
Yeah.

510
00:24:58,224 --> 00:25:00,159
Yeah, I believe that.

511
00:25:01,294 --> 00:25:04,830
Just be glad someone else did it.

512
00:25:04,864 --> 00:25:06,999
That he's gone.

513
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:13,472
The fortune-teller said
something about your mom.

514
00:25:13,506 --> 00:25:14,975
She okay ?

515
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:18,411
Time comes, Lil...

516
00:25:19,346 --> 00:25:22,014
I might need you to
have my back, too.

517
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,484
Partners, right ?

518
00:25:42,053 --> 00:25:43,487
- Thought I was invisible.
- So did we,

519
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:45,089
till we found your name

520
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,690
in a Jones brothers payroll.

521
00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:47,991
Quite a healthy rap sheet
you got there, Eddie.

522
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:50,460
Mama always said I had a
little bit of the devil in me.

523
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:52,562
Sure she's real proud: Drugs,

524
00:25:52,597 --> 00:25:54,498
cons, kiting checks...

525
00:25:54,532 --> 00:25:57,000
Youthful indiscretions, detectives.

526
00:25:57,234 --> 00:25:58,502
Made a few mistakes.

527
00:25:58,536 --> 00:26:01,638
Is she one of those indiscretions ?

528
00:26:01,672 --> 00:26:03,807
You might say that.

529
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:06,243
But she was far from a mistake.

530
00:26:06,277 --> 00:26:07,577
Destroying Mia's rig,

531
00:26:07,612 --> 00:26:08,745
Threatening her in front of
witnesses...

532
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:10,213
- those aren't mistakes ?
- Wait a second.

533
00:26:10,248 --> 00:26:11,515
I didn't even work the big top.

534
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:12,782
I know. She had you kicked out.

535
00:26:12,817 --> 00:26:14,984
Had you shoveling pachyderm pies.

536
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:17,220
Cost you money,
not to mention your pride.

537
00:26:17,255 --> 00:26:18,321
About to narc you out.

538
00:26:18,356 --> 00:26:20,156
But you weren't looking
to do jail time,

539
00:26:20,191 --> 00:26:21,892
- so you did her instead.
- You got me.

540
00:26:21,926 --> 00:26:23,593
Guilty as charged.

541
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:26,563
If you call love a crime.

542
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:27,764
Love ?

543
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,733
Anyone could see that that girl

544
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:31,601
was a bud about to bloom.

545
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:32,602
All she needed was

546
00:26:32,637 --> 00:26:33,803
a double dose of Eddie.

547
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:35,772
I might just hit you on principle.

548
00:26:35,806 --> 00:26:38,174
Seem to have that effect on women.

549
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:40,210
The other side of desire.

550
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:44,347
That young lady
was bursting with it.

551
00:26:48,652 --> 00:26:52,692
<i>"Riders on the storm"
by The Doors.</i>

552
00:26:57,895 --> 00:26:59,896
Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday.

553
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,565
I've been shoveling
crap my whole life.

554
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:05,402
So don't lose
any sleep over me, okay ?

555
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:08,471
I'm just under a lot of pressure

556
00:27:08,505 --> 00:27:11,675
and I could've handled it better.

557
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,711
I heard about your folks.

558
00:27:16,414 --> 00:27:18,315
It takes a lot of guts
doing what you're doing.

559
00:27:19,684 --> 00:27:21,585
Well, I don't really
know what else to do.

560
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:24,621
I mean... family needs me.

561
00:27:24,655 --> 00:27:27,090
I guess you had to grow up
a little fast around here.

562
00:27:27,124 --> 00:27:30,827
So maybe, you and I aren't
so different after all.

563
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:33,530
Sounds like you've been around
quite a bit. What about you ?

564
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:36,266
I never heard of a circus
that didn't travel.

565
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,967
I've been to a bunch of places,

566
00:27:38,002 --> 00:27:39,970
but I never get to leave the lot.

567
00:27:40,004 --> 00:27:41,572
Never ?

568
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:44,741
Once.

569
00:27:45,176 --> 00:27:46,576
When I was a little girl,

570
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:48,912
my mom took me down
to bourbon street.

571
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:50,547
New Orleans.

572
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:53,183
There was one of
those jazz funerals.

573
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:56,487
Something eerie about it, but...

574
00:27:57,921 --> 00:27:59,522
It was beautiful.

575
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:11,134
We should go out tonight.

576
00:28:12,503 --> 00:28:14,938
I'm not sure cleo would like that.

577
00:28:15,572 --> 00:28:18,975
Not all adventures are out there.

578
00:29:11,195 --> 00:29:12,896
You should come with me.

579
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:16,834
Where ?

580
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:20,303
Anywhere but this
stick and rag show.

581
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,407
You're 18.

582
00:29:24,442 --> 00:29:26,543
- You can do anything you want.
- Mia !

583
00:29:26,577 --> 00:29:28,044
Giving it up to some gaucho !

584
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,412
Have you lost your mind ?!

585
00:29:29,447 --> 00:29:30,547
- Come on !
- No !

586
00:29:30,581 --> 00:29:32,215
- Get out. Come with me !
- Wait...

587
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:34,250
Cleo ! No !

588
00:29:34,285 --> 00:29:35,919
Come on !

589
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:43,326
I felt bad for Mia.

590
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,760
If you ask me, there was something

591
00:29:44,795 --> 00:29:46,796
weird was going on
between those two.

592
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,933
You know, she was 18 and they
were still sharing a boxcar.

593
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:51,167
- Sketchy.
- Sketchier

594
00:29:51,202 --> 00:29:53,369
- than an alcoholic clown ?
- Next day,

595
00:29:53,404 --> 00:29:55,071
She had a busted lip,

596
00:29:55,406 --> 00:29:57,107
Compliments of Cleo.

597
00:29:57,741 --> 00:29:59,943
You painted a pretty
picture of mia, cleo.

598
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:03,379
But, uh, but she wasn't
such an angel, now, was she ?

599
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:06,549
Droppin' acid, doing riggers...

600
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:07,650
Then there's you.

601
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:09,385
Me ?! What the hell's
that supposed to mean ?

602
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,321
Keeping tight quarters
with a teenage girl

603
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:13,523
All those years...
Used to having her

604
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:15,425
- by your side.
- What are you saying ?

605
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:17,227
Take a seat.

606
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:21,064
I slept on the floor.

607
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,334
I would never, ever do

608
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:25,468
what you're suggesting.

609
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:27,437
Mia was my daughter.
She was not blood.

610
00:30:27,471 --> 00:30:29,038
Was to me !

611
00:30:29,073 --> 00:30:30,907
Maybe I was strict
and overprotective,

612
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:32,976
but that place was
swarming with snakes.

613
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,077
Like Eddie Armstrong ?

614
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:36,412
Damn straight.

615
00:30:36,447 --> 00:30:39,749
Combed the lot,
found her tripping with that...

616
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:41,684
fink trying to get in her pants.

617
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:42,886
I just snapped.

618
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,988
Oh, busted her lip trying
to show her who's boss.

619
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:46,224
No !

620
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:48,225
Never laid a hand on her.

621
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,760
She was so out of it, kept falling.

622
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:53,462
I watched her all
night till she finally

623
00:30:53,497 --> 00:30:55,231
- Came down.
- Always there to catch her, huh ?

624
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,335
Not always.

625
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,938
But I tried.

626
00:31:01,972 --> 00:31:03,573
But you couldn't let go.

627
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:04,841
And all you had was her

628
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,442
and that bottle.

629
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:07,644
She was becoming a woman.

630
00:31:07,678 --> 00:31:08,812
You were losing her.

631
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:10,346
Holding her back so much that...

632
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:12,282
You were suffocating her.

633
00:31:12,316 --> 00:31:13,249
No, you're wrong.

634
00:31:13,284 --> 00:31:15,652
Loved her so much,
I wanted her to go.

635
00:31:15,686 --> 00:31:18,688
She needed to get
away from that place.

636
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,291
From me.

637
00:31:25,662 --> 00:31:29,731
<i>"Moonlight drive" by The Doors.</i>

638
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,653
<i>For Mia Romanov and her amazing</i>

639
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:57,854
<i>metamorphosis !</i>

640
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:01,590
You were...

641
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,826
beautiful !

642
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,361
You looked just like
your mother up there.

643
00:33:06,196 --> 00:33:07,929
- You liked it ?
- I've seen the future,

644
00:33:07,964 --> 00:33:09,165
and you're it, kiddo.

645
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:10,700
Your act is too good for this top.

646
00:33:10,734 --> 00:33:13,336
What are you talking about?
This is exactly what we need.

647
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,738
You heard the crowd. This will save us.
This place is dying.

648
00:33:15,773 --> 00:33:17,273
You don't need to die with it.

649
00:33:17,907 --> 00:33:19,309
But this is my family.

650
00:33:19,343 --> 00:33:21,044
Cleo, I'm not going anywhere.

651
00:33:21,078 --> 00:33:22,648
You know how...

652
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:25,349
when a circus elephant is born,

653
00:33:25,382 --> 00:33:28,551
the bull handler will
secure it with a thin rope

654
00:33:28,585 --> 00:33:30,753
Tied to a skinny
stick in the ground?

655
00:33:30,788 --> 00:33:32,789
Sure, and when that
elephant grows up,

656
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:36,893
that rope and skinny stick
can still make him stay put.

657
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:41,464
That stick can't hold you anymore.

658
00:33:41,498 --> 00:33:43,666
Are you calling me an elephant?

659
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:53,443
I wish she'd listened to me,
but it was already too late.

660
00:33:53,577 --> 00:33:54,911
She fell the next night.

661
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:56,980
Buried her in the Romanov family plot.

662
00:33:57,714 --> 00:34:00,449
A few days later, I was back
on the sawdust in Allentown.

663
00:34:00,684 --> 00:34:02,218
A few days?

664
00:34:02,652 --> 00:34:04,554
Thought the circus
Was due in allentown

665
00:34:04,588 --> 00:34:06,122
The night after the accident?

666
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:07,357
Don't know who told you that.

667
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:09,292
No, we had a week between stops.

668
00:34:09,826 --> 00:34:11,661
Got the route card to prove it.

669
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:18,970
Losing track of all
your lies, Biggie.

670
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:21,172
Told us you were due
in Allentown

671
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:23,140
when you had a week between gigs.

672
00:34:23,175 --> 00:34:26,977
We had to wildcat it out of
there after Mia's nosedive.

673
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:29,046
Especially since you had a
murder scene to tear down.

674
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:31,882
Come on, who's going
to take their kiddies

675
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:34,084
to see us after a fall like that ?

676
00:34:34,118 --> 00:34:35,619
Thought with a little
extra time,

677
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:37,455
we could drum up some business
in Allentown.

678
00:34:40,158 --> 00:34:41,125
I know what it looks like,

679
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,727
- but it was a business decision.
- You weren't the only one

680
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:44,962
Making business decisions.

681
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:47,131
Found out Ringling
Brothers wanted Mia.

682
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:50,233
Ringling-- they tried
to poach everyone.

683
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:52,736
After everything your
family had done for her.

684
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,271
Raising Mia as one of their own.

685
00:34:54,306 --> 00:34:56,239
Knew if you lost her,
it was all over.

686
00:34:56,274 --> 00:34:57,574
But Mia wouldn't fall in line.

687
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:00,043
Left a little man with a
big temper holding the bag.

688
00:35:00,077 --> 00:35:01,345
And when it's all said and done,

689
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,981
Mia ends up eating sawdust.

690
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:05,216
Come on, you guys.

691
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:08,786
Do I look like I could hurt anyone ?

692
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,354
Spoke to Biggie, Lester.

693
00:35:11,688 --> 00:35:13,456
Remember him ?

694
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,458
Yes. Biggie.

695
00:35:15,493 --> 00:35:18,494
Well, he says you killed Mia.

696
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:19,997
Me ?

697
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:21,465
Biggie couldn't have killed Mia.

698
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,100
Couldn't have lifted her
up into that cocoon.

699
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:28,304
I'm thinking he
forced you to do it, Lester.

700
00:35:28,338 --> 00:35:31,207
Like he always forced you.

701
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:33,544
You don't have to be scared
of Biggie anymore.

702
00:35:33,578 --> 00:35:35,212
He can't hurt you.

703
00:35:35,547 --> 00:35:37,047
No, you got it wrong !

704
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:39,783
You put yourself
At the scene, Biggie.

705
00:35:40,217 --> 00:35:41,584
Said she was "good to go."

706
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:44,221
Mia was dead. You got Lester
to stuff her into silks just

707
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:46,124
- to cover it up.
- I'd done

708
00:35:46,126 --> 00:35:47,695
some things I had to do.

709
00:35:48,696 --> 00:35:51,496
But I did not kill Mia.

710
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:56,667

00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:09,846
- What are you doing here ?
- This makes no sense.

It says we've sold 800 tickets.

00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,719
Scram.

721
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:18,956
Listen, sweetheart,

722
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,825
to make sure that
the show can go on,

723
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:23,661
- I've had to be a little creative.
- We're not affiliated

724
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:26,296
with any charity, but you're selling
tickets in their name.

725
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:28,165
Where were these kids
in the stands ?

726
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,133
It's a write-off to
local businesses.

727
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:32,135
It's one thing to rip
people off on the midway,

728
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,072
But you're going to use my act
to scam

729
00:36:34,073 --> 00:36:36,240
- charities for orphans ?
- What do you care ?

730
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:38,775
You'll be flying under
the ringling top soon.

731
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:40,644
What ?

732
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,946
That's right. I know all about it.

733
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:46,650
I can't believe you, Biggie.

734
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:50,420
I was going to tell them "no.
" but now?

735
00:37:01,098 --> 00:37:02,966
Once I told management,

736
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:04,801
it was out of my hands.

737
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:05,802
Management, huh ?

738
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:07,604
Controlled the whole thing.

739
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,439
And just who was
this management ?

740
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:13,310
- Bunch of suits out of florida.
- You see, that's a crock.

741
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,312
The SEC has no record

742
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:17,280
of J.B. Ricketts investments.

743
00:37:17,315 --> 00:37:18,649
But Wikipedia does.

744
00:37:19,283 --> 00:37:20,851
J.B. Ricketts founded

745
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:22,486
the American circus.

746
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,088
Died in 1799.

747
00:37:25,923 --> 00:37:27,323
There was no management.

748
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:29,159
It was you. No.

749
00:37:30,495 --> 00:37:32,629
If it were just that simple.

750
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:36,533
You were diagnosed with

751
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:40,003
is it cerebral gigantism ?

752
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:41,738
It's a pretty rare disorder.

753
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,374
Often accompanied with diminished

754
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:45,876
Mental capacity.

755
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,611
The d.A.'s willing to
cut a deal for you.

756
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:49,246
We don't want to
send you to county,

757
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,447
so you tell us what happened

758
00:37:50,481 --> 00:37:51,982
and we'll make sure you go

759
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:53,350
to a comfortable medical facility.

760
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:55,585
Oh, yeah, they'll get
you squared away.

761
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,122
In a year or two, you're a
handyman in Reading again.

762
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:03,460
Help us put biggie away for good.

763
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,907
Biggie was a... a monster.

764
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:18,709
He...

765
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:20,213
he...

766
00:38:21,214 --> 00:38:23,314
he made me.

767
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,018
This lifeline,

768
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:29,419
Those meds--

769
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:30,954
Pretty expensive. I didn't know

770
00:38:30,988 --> 00:38:32,522
The circus had such great benefits.

771
00:38:32,557 --> 00:38:34,524
So, we decided to check.

772
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:35,759
Turns out they don't.

773
00:38:35,993 --> 00:38:38,295
Your medicine is paid for
by a private company.

774
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:39,830
Same company pays your rent.

775
00:38:40,798 --> 00:38:42,999
- You don't get it, do you ?
- No, I get it.

776
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:45,402
And you're going to prison,
and there's no ppo in the pokie.

777
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:48,071
A guy like you won't
last six months.

778
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:51,341
Last time, big.

779
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,642
Who was management ?

780
00:38:58,649 --> 00:39:01,118
"he made me."

781
00:39:01,252 --> 00:39:03,286
Man, I hope we got that on video.

782
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:05,288
Submit it to the academy.

783
00:39:05,322 --> 00:39:07,991
See, the thing is,
people with cerebral gigantism,

784
00:39:08,025 --> 00:39:09,893
Although usually
bigger as children,

785
00:39:09,927 --> 00:39:12,195
Are often in the normal
height range as adults.

786
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,830
Far from normal, gargantuan.

787
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:16,032
That country doctor
misdiagnosed you.

788
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:17,968
You don't have cerebral gigantism.

789
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:18,902
You're just big.

790
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:20,070
No, but you ain't no dummy.

791
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:22,072
See, I wanted to talk to your boss.

792
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:23,440
Went to the city tax assessors

793
00:39:23,474 --> 00:39:25,342
To see who owns that
building you maintain.

794
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:26,977
Found out, it's you. You own it.

795
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:28,812
Along with half a dozen others.

796
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:30,046
Big top, incorporated.

797
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:32,149
Same company that pays
Biggie's bill.

798
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:34,184
You were management.

799
00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:37,687
Me ?

800
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:41,424
Biggie's confession.

801
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:43,059
I'd give it to you in picture form,

802
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:46,062
But we know you weren't
hit with the idiot stick.

803
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:49,299
In fact, you're a millionaire.

804
00:39:51,835 --> 00:39:54,037
Now, Biggie told us
how his circus was dying

805
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:56,472
Till you took it over.
You weren't his puppet.

806
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:58,208
He was yours.

807
00:40:05,015 --> 00:40:08,485
Seen that fear in your eyes
all my life.

808
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,688
But when those cake eaters
would step into ten-in-one...

809
00:40:11,722 --> 00:40:13,089
looking at me.

810
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:14,591
Laughing.

811
00:40:16,025 --> 00:40:17,360
Pointing.

812
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:19,362
They thought I was on exhibit.

813
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:23,133
But I was studying them.

814
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:24,901
So you concocted

815
00:40:24,935 --> 00:40:27,838
A scam to get back at them.
Steal their money.

816
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:28,972
Prove you were smarter.

817
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:32,042
No. It was about
preserving our family.

818
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:33,310
Our livelihoods.

819
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:36,646
The one place where no one
would treat me like a freak.

820
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:38,515
But Mia busted you on your scam.

821
00:40:38,649 --> 00:40:40,149
Wouldn't take part.

822
00:40:40,484 --> 00:40:43,453
We could've moved on.
Gone back to the family we were.

823
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:46,389
I couldn't just... sit by

824
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:48,625
And have her tear us apart.

825
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:54,798
Wanted to wish you
a good show, kid.

826
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:58,969
But Mia, what you saw,

827
00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:02,005
Those phone calls,
will never happen again, mia.

828
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,707
We'll sell out with your act

829
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:06,176
and some old-fashioned bally.

830
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,844
Family again.

831
00:41:07,878 --> 00:41:10,280
No blood, no foul.

832
00:41:10,814 --> 00:41:12,549
You expect me to trust you ?

833
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:14,684
- You're a con.
- Mia, listen...

834
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,086
You know what a con man
hates most ?

835
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,387
People knowing the truth.

836
00:41:19,056 --> 00:41:21,691
Look, there's no need
to get the cops involved.

837
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:23,793
I'm a kinker. No cops.
After the show,

838
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:25,428
I'm telling the family the truth.

839
00:41:26,263 --> 00:41:28,598
Mia! Don't be a fool.

840
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:30,900
Let them make their
own decisions, Biggie.

841
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:32,869
I've already made mine.

842
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:35,104
Now, I gotta fly.

843
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:53,191
<i>"People are strange" by The Doors.</i>
