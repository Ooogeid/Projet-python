<i>Wow, stewardesses, Stuart.</i>

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,220
Should be in London
by 9:00, Ally.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,710
In time for a late supper.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,220
Can you believe it, Helen ?

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,690
We're jet-setters.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,340
Cheese steaks for lunch,

10
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:31,741
Shepherd's Pie for dinner.

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,100
Big Ben, here we come.

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,700
Are you a real, live stewardess ?

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,120
Living and breathing.

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,280
Can I take a picture with you ?

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,040
My best friend Sally won't believe it.

16
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,830
Give me the camera.
I'll take it.

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,760
Smile, Ally.

18
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,740
Wow, thanks.

19
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,100
Is it true you get to fly
on airplanes every day

20
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:50,601
and meet lots of people and
go to Tokyo and California ?

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,860
All those things and more.

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,380
It's the best job in the world.

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,670
Thanks.

What've you got, boss ?

27
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,630
Place used to be the Republican Hotel.

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,750
Been vacant since '72.

29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,410
A lot of work going on upstairs.

30
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,390
Developer just bought it,
turning it to condos.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,030
Renovation crew found
human remains...

32
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,570
intact hip bone.

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,570
CSU's thinking female.

34
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,160
Dumped in the old incinerator.

35
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,040
Hotels used to burn their garbage.

36
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,890
What better place for a body ?

37
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,210
Detective.

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,170
Pin from an airline.

00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,890

Global World Airlines.

41
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,360
Hasn't been around
since the early '60s.

42
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,410
Got ourselves a pilot ?

43
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,930
Pilots were only male back then.
More likely a stewardess.

44
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,290
It was layover at the hotel,
maybe some kind of tryst ?

45
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,010
And someone clipped her wings.

Wings

49
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,510
Ally Thurston, 21-year-old,
stewardess.

50
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,780
Think they're called
flight attendants, John.

51
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,580
Not in 1960, they weren't.

52
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,520
When servers were waitresses.

53
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,360
The good old days.

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,970
Ally was reported
missing November 18,1960,

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,940
by roommate Helen McCormick,
another stewardess based in Philly.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,160
They saw each other
in the crew lounge at 11 a.m.

57
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:22,061
Ally had flown in from Dallas,

58
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,300
was signing out
after another flight.

59
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,050
Well, they were supposed to
go out together that night.

60
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,050
And Helen got home,
Ally never showed.

61
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,730
She called the police the next morning.

62
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,030
Assigned searched her room, found an
itinerary for a flight to Spain...

63
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,220
Philly to Madrid,
American Flight 289,

64
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:37,921
November 18 at 12:30 p.m.

65
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,820
Decided she was off jet-setting.

66
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,610
Search ended then and there.

67
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,490
Global World flew international.

68
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,000
Why buy a ticket on another airline

69
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,480
when you can fly your own
for free ?

70
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,230
Someone else buys her
the ticket ?

71
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,470
Any guys in the picture ?

72
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,450
None in here.
But the swinging '60s,

73
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:53,351
stews would've had
plenty of suitors.

74
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,530
Family ?

75
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,400
Parents : Lew and Debra Thurston
in Glassboro, New Jersey.

76
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,110
Gotta cross the bridge.

77
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,550
I'll take the drive.

78
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,500
Get a DNA swab from the
family to ID her remains.

79
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,020
Guy converting the condos

80
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:14,221
is using the old hotel guest books
to decorate the lobby.

81
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,770
Said I'd give them
back when we were done.

82
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,970
Got everything from '52 till
the place went belly-up in '73.

83
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,170
Man, travel ain't what it used to be.

84
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,750
How would you know ?

85
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,380
Ain't left Philly since I known you.

86
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,960
Six weeks' vacation time built up, Will.

87
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,010
Use it or lose it.

88
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,240
As a matter of fact, considering
a little trip to the Balkan Riviera.

89
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,320
Is that a planet from Star Trek ?

90
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,130
- Croatia.
- Croatia.

91
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,350
With the wars ?

92
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,030
It's a hot destination
these days.

93
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,120
Top ten beaches in the world.

94
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,760
Keep up, son.

95
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,660
Let you know in a couple days,
Mr.Thurston.

96
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,820
Guess you're used to this...
people dying.

97
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,500
Anything you can tell me about
the last time you saw Ally ?

98
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,820
We were a lot alike,
my daughter and me.

99
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,920
Both passionate.
Both stubborn as an ox.

100
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,260
Trouble getting along ?

101
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,560
Wondered if she joined
the airline

102
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:14,361
just to get away from me.

103
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,030
No, I'm sure there were
other reasons.

104
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,660
Once she put her mind
to something, look out.

105
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,000
She was, she was always
my little girl.

106
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,420
Just...

107
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,070
different with fathers
and daughters, you know ?

108
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,640
You... you talk to her
after she left ?

109
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,410
She said she'd call, but...

110
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,240
Any boyfriends you knew about ?

111
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,340
Just Bert, from high school.

112
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,700
Bert Walters.

113
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,020
Not a fan ?

114
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,480
Kid couldn't let her out of his sight.

115
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,310
She was too good for him,and he knew it.

116
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,240
Thanks for your time.

117
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,550
I may not look like
the adventurous type,

118
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,690
but Ally got her travel bug
from me.

119
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:02,691
How's that ?

120
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,080
Served in the infantry
in World War II,

121
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:06,981
helped liberate Paris.

122
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,030
Brought back an Eiffel
Tower trinket for her.

123
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,720
Told her we'd collect one for
every monument in the world.

124
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,420
Never happened.

125
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,410
Yeah ?

126
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,580
Who the hell is this ?

127
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,380
What ?

128
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,920
Some joker called me
a punk ass bitch.

129
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,630
How do you know ?

130
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,770
Dr.McCormick ?

131
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,540
Yes.

132
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,050
Sorry I'm late.

133
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,740
My patient delivered twins.

134
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,520
A long way from stewardessing.

135
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,040
Well, I never intended
that to be a career.

136
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,310
You said there was a case
I could help you with ?

137
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,370
Yeah. We want to talk to
you about Ally Thurston.

138
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,280
You were her roommate.

139
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,050
Ally ?

140
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,070
You found her ?

141
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,150
The two of you were close ?

142
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,700
From the moment we started
stewardess training.

143
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,280
Was she in Spain like they said ?

144
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,500
Philly.

145
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,240
Two of you ever go to
the Republican Hotel ?

146
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,610
Lobby bar, maybe ?

147
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,830
We never went there, no.

148
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,310
I told the police
she didn't run off.

149
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,830
They'd already made up
their minds about her.

150
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,040
All those ads making
stewardesses out to be sexpots.

151
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:00,595
Last time you saw her,
November, 11 a.m.

152
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:02,731
she was upset about anything ?

153
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,460
Ally wasn't the type to get upset.

154
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,990
If something was bothering her,
she'd fix it...

155
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,360
move on.

156
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,000
Small-town moxie.

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,500
Any idea who might've
invited her to Spain ?

158
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,440
A boyfriend ?

159
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,920
Yes. I told them
from the beginning.

160
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,270
It wasn't the guys

161
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:20,071
she was meeting in the air
who were the problem.

162
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,050
Are you Helen McCormick ?

163
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,830
Oh, you must be Ally Thurston,
my new roommate.

164
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,070
Hope you don't mind snoring.

165
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,800
So, where are you from ?

166
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,660
Recruited straight from
the University of Colorado.

167
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,970
How about you ?

168
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,720
Glassboro, New Jersey.

169
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,560
Population: boring.

170
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,250
Small-town girl, huh ?

171
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,660
It was either nurse,
schoolteacher or librarian

172
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,270
till I saw the GWA
recruitment ad in the paper.

173
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,650
Good morning, ladies !
Good morning !

174
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,980
I'm Gloria Flagstone.

175
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,310
And you, my dears,
are the elite of the elite.

176
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,870
Only three out of a hundred girls
is chosen to be a GWA stewardess.

177
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,740
You had a better chance of
getting into Harvard this year.

178
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,280
Now, it can be a glamorous life,
but you'll work hard.

179
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,850
You'll travel the world

180
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:07,551
and maybe even meet Mr.Right.

181
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,480
You'll start today with your weigh-ins,

182
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,681
then you'll receive your girdles
and your uniforms.

183
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,470
Weigh-ins ?

184
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,000
Is she pulling our leg ?

185
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,620
I haven't eaten in two days.

186
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,310
The weight they assigned me at my
interview is not an easy target.

187
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,800
Ally ! Ally !

188
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,570
Hey ! Ally !  Ally !  Ally !

189
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,620
Let's get out of here,
Ally-Cat !

190
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,440
Pack your stuff,
I'm taking you home !

191
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,790
Ally !

192
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,170
I'll be back, Ally !

193
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,370
You'll see!

194
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,970
You can't get rid of me
that easy !

195
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:41,471
<i>"Too marvelous for words"
by Franck Sinatra.</i>

196
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,300
Fellow was determined
to keep her grounded.

197
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,820
He thought they were going
to marry after high school.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,090
He ever come back ?

199
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,650
Stood across the street,

200
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:53,451
staring up at the dorm room
every night.

201
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,680
He was obsessed with her.

202
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,960
How did Ally feel about it ?

203
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,460
God knows why,
but she felt bad about it.

204
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,990
She said that she'd tried to
let him down gently,but that...

205
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,220
he had a mean streak.

206
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,140
Couldn't let it go.

207
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,390
Ally ?

208
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,680
Yeah, wow, blast from the past.

209
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,270
We had a thing in high school.

210
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,400
How'd you feel about her leaving
town to become a stewardess?

211
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,910
Out of sight, out of mind,
know what I mean ?

212
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,400
So how do you explain stalking
her at the training school ?

213
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,740
Sobbing like a little baby.

214
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,400
Sounds like you cared a lot, Bert.

215
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,430
So I went by her school a few times.

216
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,650
Doesn't mean I hurt her.

217
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,840
Saying your name isn't going to show up
when we check her flight logs ?

218
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,980
You can wait while we check them.

219
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,370
- Be a few hours.
- A few days.

220
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,920
Wait.

221
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,690
Ally was, like, everything to me.

222
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,300
What'd you do to her, Bert ?

223
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,380
I saved my money,
bought a ticket.

224
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,230
I thought she was the one.

225
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,410
But it was like she was slipping
through my fingers, and there was...

226
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,010
nothing I could do about it.

227
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,980
Appetizers ?

228
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,340
Would you like a drink ?

229
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,550
Cigarettes ?

230
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,980
Cigarettes ?

231
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,760
Martini ?

232
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,080
I feel like I'm running
a marathon.

233
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,160
Well, at least you won't have
to worry about your weight.

234
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,000
Think Gloria could pitch in
a little ?

235
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,000
...the Prince and the Princess
lived happily ever after,"

236
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,420
"for this is how such
things ought to be."

237
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,660
She says the books calm the kids down.

238
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,950
I think she likes the
story more than they do.

239
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,270
Got it.

240
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,320
Thanks.

241
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,680
That would have caused a commotion.

242
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,450
Well, right place, right time,
I guess.

243
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,400
Dean London, First Officer.

244
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,820
Ally Thurston,
low girl on the totem pole.

245
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,390
Static electricity.

246
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,440
Airplanes.

247
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,900
Airplanes. Right.

248
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,580
Well, see you around, Ally.

249
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,820
See ya, First Officer London.

250
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,320
It'll be smooth sailing tonight,
huh, cricket ?

251
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,280
Easy, cookie, got to make sure
you're wearing your regulation girdle.

252
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,220
Which bunny's gonna bring me
my coffee tonight,

253
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:27,621
one of the new recruits ?

254
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,460
I'll be taking care of you,
Captain Hughes.

255
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,960
Coffee is the only drink
you'll be getting.

256
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,830
Thanks, doll.

257
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,000
First flight ?

258
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,510
Is it that obvious ?

259
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,650
Harvey Dwight.

260
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,340
"Brilliant Import/Exports".

261
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,450
In Madrid, Spain ?

262
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,700
Call me when you need
a vacation.

263
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,080
I'll take you there sometime.

264
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,470
Champagne and caviar
all the way.

265
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,271
<i>"I've got the world on a string"
by Franck Sinatra.</i>

266
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,150
I couldn't take it anymore.

267
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,560
Watching Ally get hit
on by those la-di-da's.

268
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,990
You sure this Harvey Dwight said
he was taking her to Madrid ?

269
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,160
I'm sure.

270
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,840
That's how I knew I'd lost her.

271
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,970
I couldn't find Madrid on a map.

272
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,510
Boss, got the 411

273
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,211
on this Harvey Dwight
and Brilliant Import/Exports.

274
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,720
Company based in Madrid
like he said ?

275
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,600
Guy's had multiple real estate
holdings there since '58.

276
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,020
And he's a convicted gem smuggler.

277
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,350
Busted in '63,
served six years at Club Fed.

278
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,190
Gem wholesaler
out of New York today.

279
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,680
Used stewardesses
to help him smuggle ?

280
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,620
Connie Thunder and Lois Murphy,
both with GWA.

281
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,690
Convicted and served
from '63 to '65.

282
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,040
Well, call NYPD...
let's get him in here.

283
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,060
Connie Thunder.

284
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,120
Lois Murphy.

285
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,950
Sounds like you read
my trial transcripts.

286
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,900
'63's a long time ago.

287
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,910
You get Ally Thurston involved
in your racket, too, Harvey ?

288
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,040
There's a big difference
between smuggling stones

289
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:09,541
and having the stones
to murder a girl.

290
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,010
She working for you ?

291
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,570
She was just another fish
I was trying to hook.

292
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,950
Fish ?

293
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,800
You mean, another mule.

294
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,510
I tried to reel her in

295
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:22,411
with the expense-paid vacation,
but, uh...

296
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,470
she could read people
even better than I could.

297
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,740
Harvey Dwight !

298
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,950
I know what you're up to,
and I'm not going with you to Spain

299
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:38,551
today, tomorrow or ever !

300
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,770
But, Ally, with your brains
and my beauty...

301
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,740
We could get into a
whole lot of trouble.

302
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,020
Republican Hotel,
fast as you can.

303
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,450
Don't know why
she was going there.

304
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,070
But it was the only time
I'd seen her upset

305
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,871
in the five months I knew her.

306
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,440
We should believe you didn't
follow her to the hotel ?

307
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,620
Because I flew to Madrid
without her.

308
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,260
I left Philly a half hour after
she got in the cab.

309
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,420
This was November 18
you saw her ?

310
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,640
12:00 noon.

311
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,240
Looked at Republican guest books
with November 18 in mind.

312
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,540
Room 109.

313
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,820
Housekeeping notes next
to it the next morning.

314
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,330
Replace missing linens
and broken telephone.

315
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,560
Could be our crime scene.

316
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,690
Guy murders her in his room,
wraps her in the sheets,

317
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:31,191
carries her to the basement.

318
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,340
Broken phone.

319
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,890
Yeah, 1960 models
weighed half a ton.

320
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,460
Enough to bludgeon
someone to death.

321
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,680
Who's the room registered to ?

322
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,900
T.C. Bromley, regular at the joint.

323
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,670
Stayed there once a month
for ten years

324
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:42,971
until November 18.

325
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,350
Then he never comes back.

326
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,200
Right.

327
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,660
Checked the name against
GWA employee lists.

328
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,170
No matches, no record.

329
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,040
See if you can find
former hotel employees...

330
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,341
maybe someone remembers him.

331
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,220
If they're still alive.

332
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,440
Croatia for a vacation, huh ?

333
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,160
It's a beautiful country.

334
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,710
What, Beirut was booked ?

335
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,440
You were Ally's supervisor
back then ?

336
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:24,020
We used to carve
Chateaubriand to order.

337
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,260
Offer martinis, shaken or stirred.

338
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,550
Any idea why she would've been going
to the Republican Hotel

339
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:31,951
the day she disappeared ?

340
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,000
No.

341
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,710
Ally was based in Philly.

342
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,540
She had an apartment in town.

343
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,730
What about airline employees
from out of town ?

344
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,680
They would've stayed
at the Airport Hotel.

345
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:44,081
They got a discount and
a lively social scene.

346
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,000
Ally into partying,
living the stewardess life ?

347
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,790
No more than any of us were.

348
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,410
It was a glamorous life
being a stewardess.

349
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,650
We were like...

350
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,090
movie stars.

351
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,220
Ever hear her mention
the name T.C.Bromley ?

352
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,170
No, I don't recognize the name.

353
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,140
Well, what about boyfriends ?

354
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,410
Well, if you're looking for a man who
wanted to get Ally into a hotel room,

355
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,370
look no further
than Dean London.

356
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,390
Acapulco mexico

357
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,350
Ready for your drink,
Miss Rogers ?

358
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,250
Thought you'd never ask,
Mr.Astaire.

359
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,410
What do you got,
a .38 special in here ?

360
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,270
No.

361
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,180
It's the Empire State Building.

362
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,510
Picked it up in New York this
morning for my collection.

363
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,160
Collection of souvenirs...
cute, kiddo.

364
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,980
It's more than that.

365
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,260
My father got me the Eiffel Tower
when I was five.

366
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,710
I'm gonna get every one.

367
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,950
Well, you've got the right job
to do it.

368
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,790
And if I make captain, I might
be the man to take you there.

369
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,540
If you don't make captain,
the earth will stop spinning.

370
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,150
That's the only thing
you think about.

371
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,820
Not the only thing.

372
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,820
Peggy was my favorite
instructor at the Charm Farm.

373
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,260
Today's her birthday ?

374
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,720
Her going away.

375
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,080
She hit the age ceiling.

376
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,110
Peggy's 32 ?

377
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,530
But she's still a knockout.

378
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,090
Knockout or not,
airline's canning her.

379
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,160
Doesn't seem very fair.

380
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,380
Don't you worry
your pretty little head.

381
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,950
Most girls find husbands
and leave before then anyway.

382
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,670
How about you, old gal,
you gonna age out soon ?

383
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,580
I'm 26 years old,
Captain Hughes.

384
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,320
Why, do I look like
an old bag to you ?

385
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,270
You're anything but, Gloria.

386
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,140
Back then, pilots thought that

387
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:43,441
stewardesses were there just
to make them happy.

388
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,660
This Captain Hughes
sounds pretty frisky.

389
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,120
Yeah, he was a flirt, all right.

390
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,320
But he was married.

391
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,430
Dean had his sights set on Ally ?

392
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,420
Like he was bringing
a bird in for landing.

393
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,970
Ally was a great gal.

394
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,590
We dated a month, maybe two.

395
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,670
We'd split up by the time
she disappeared.

396
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,170
When was that ?

397
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,150
October, November.

398
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,450
I don't remember.

399
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,650
You stay at the Republican Hotel
during your layovers in Philly ?

400
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,640
No. Why ?

401
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,010
Do you remember where you were
the night Ally disappeared ?

402
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,990
Yeah, uh, Miami.

403
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,750
Breakers Hotel.

404
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,200
You can check it.

405
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,520
Cops never questioned you
when she went missing ?

406
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,780
There was no reason to.

407
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,570
Said she flew off into the
sunset with some Don Juan.

408
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,240
So, why'd you two break up
anyway ?

409
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,420
Different flights, different cities.

410
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,930
I don't know where you're
going with this, but it was 1960.

411
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,570
I was single, flying
707's in a fancy uniform.

412
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,070
You saying Ally was just a fling ?

413
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,900
I'm saying she had spunk.

414
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,810
And I admired that spunk.

415
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,480
Not all men found it charming.

416
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,640
Your coffee, Captain Hues.

417
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,170
Oh, thanks, cricket.

418
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,020
Hey, listen, we got ourselves
a little emergency up here.

419
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,560
Oxygen tank went haywire,
isn't pumping O2 into the cabin.

420
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,740
Unless we want 200 people
taking a snooze back there,

421
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,730
I'm gonna need your help
going to manual procedure.

422
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,000
Absolutely, Captain.

423
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,930
You see that button right there ?

424
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,150
I need you to push it
every half hour,

425
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:19,651
hold it down for 15 seconds.

426
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,300
Go ahead, give it a try.

427
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,500
You-you can let go now.

428
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,710
Come back in half an hour.

429
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,420
We'll do it again.

430
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,460
Oh, hey, uh, Irish up my coffee
for me, will you, kid ?

431
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,440
Yes, sir.

432
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,540
I'll need to go to manual
procedure again, Captain.

433
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,640
Get off of me !

434
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,930
Oh, you're a real tiger,
aren't you ?

435
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,020
Come on, Rowland, you had a few...
leave her alone.

436
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,400
I'll decide when I've had enough.

437
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,100
I should've knocked him
on his ass.

438
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,480
But he was your boss.

439
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,640
I needed the bastard's
recommendation.

440
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,230
She was the first girl
to turn him down.

441
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,630
At least that's what he told me.

442
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,100
They have any trouble after that ?

443
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,490
I don't know... but the same week
Ally disappeared,

444
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,270
Rowland left GWA
for South Ocean A.

445
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,520
Struck you as odd ?

446
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,030
Well, back then most pilots

447
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,031
stayed with the same airlines
their whole lives.

448
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,450
He puts in 15 years

449
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:46,551
and then leaves six months
before his pension is vested ?

450
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,880
Your move, Cooper.

451
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,640
Chess always was
your favorite game.

452
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,450
Lilly ?

453
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,190
Hi, Dad.

454
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,410
So here you are...

455
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,490
all grown up.

456
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,030
Right.

457
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,110
Don't know where to start.

458
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,580
You married ?

459
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,510
No.

460
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,480
Work for the city ?

461
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,260
Cop.

462
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,850
I'm a homicide detective.

463
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,470
Homicide.

464
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,700
Was that you outside my house ?

465
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,190
Yes.

466
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,880
So you know about...

467
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,430
Your family.

468
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,350
It's been a long time.

469
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,270
Tell you the truth, I never thought
I'd see you again.

470
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,810
Sent you a bunch of letters
a while back.

471
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,420
Yeah, I got them.

472
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,060
I still have them.

473
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,650
Thought maybe your mother had
decided not to give them to you.

474
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,500
I...

475
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,130
I got 'em.

476
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,370
I never heard back from you.

477
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,530
I was 15.

478
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,800
Not a baby.

479
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,460
You could have tried again.

480
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,820
You blame me for that.

481
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,240
That the reason you drop
out of thin air like this ?

482
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,760
To point fingers ?

483
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,510
Look...

484
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:16,511
I am so glad you're here.

485
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,840
Okay ?

486
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,740
Okay.

487
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,340
How's you're mother doing ?

488
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,650
Yeah, she's fine.

489
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,940
I got to go.

490
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,970
Lilly ?

491
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm here every week, you know.

492
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,150
Rowland Hughes, Detective Valens.

493
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,060
Airline pilot in the '60s, huh ?

494
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,800
Hand in my badge any day
to have wings back then.

495
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,090
Women you must of had
just dropping at your feet.

496
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,280
Times we won't see repeated,

497
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,450
Detective Valens.

498
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,120
Coffee?

499
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,930
Thanks, sweetheart.

500
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,670
Anyway, couple things
I got to clear up here.

501
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,950
Ally Thurston,
stew I called you about.

502
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,910
Two of you get along okay ?

503
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,220
Sure, we got along great.

504
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,550
There's something here about her
pouring whiskey on you

505
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:41,251
while you're flying a 707 ?

506
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,520
Where'd you hear that ?

507
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,600
Just give me something
for the boss.

508
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,940
I mean, you were a pilot.

509
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,110
Who'd she think she was, right ?

510
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,720
She was wound tight,
that's for sure.

511
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,530
Is that why you left GWA
for, uh, South Ocean Air ?

512
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,870
'Cause she turned you down ?

513
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,240
You think I cared about
some uppity stew ? Come on.

514
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,580
So why'd you leave ?

515
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,830
Let's just say I'd already worked my
way through the "Girls Next Door" at GWA.

516
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,550
South Ocean hired the sexpots.

517
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,910
It was time for greener pastures.

518
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,400
Right.

519
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,420
Ever take any back to
the Republican Hotel ?

520
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,050
The Republican.

521
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,200
No, not that I remember.

522
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,910
Look,Rowland.

523
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,620
I'm trying to help you.

524
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,140
Your name's in here.

525
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,710
Twice.

526
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,690
You got a room three months
before she disappeared,

527
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:35,391
another a year before that.

528
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,130
The Republican,yeah,now I remember.

529
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,870
Stayed there when
I didn't want

530
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:42,871
everyone at the Airport Hotel
knowing my business.

531
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,560
I was a married man.

532
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,090
You leave GWA the same
week she disappears.

533
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,590
You lie about staying at
the place we found her.

534
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:54,430
My first flight for South Ocean was
a overnighter to Fiji,

535
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:56,731
November 17.

536
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,910
I was out of the
country the whole month.

537
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,820
That all you got ?

538
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,360
If you really want to know
who that girl had trouble with,

539
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:05,161
talk to the women in her life.

540
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,270
Why's that ?

541
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,770
You put a bunch of 'em in
an aluminum tube, hormones raging,

542
00:27:09,771 --> 00:27:11,171
the claws come out.

543
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:16,372
..............

544
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,210
Swedish Royal Palace.

545
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,150
Wait till Dean sees this one.

546
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,180
I'm sorry. I've got to
get back to our room.

547
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,740
- But we just set out.
- I'm under the weather.

548
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,940
Why don't you go
sight-seeing without me ?

549
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,610
You've been so tired.

550
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,950
Helen, are you... ?

551
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,190
That's great news.

552
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,470
The medical student from
your flight to Detroit...

553
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,060
James.

554
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,640
Well, you're in love with him,
right ?

555
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,780
Are you going to get married ?

556
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,520
He can't support me yet.

557
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,960
And if the airline finds
out that I'm pregnant...

558
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,250
So that's why you bid
this flight to Sweden.

559
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,680
To take care of it ?

560
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,000
Don't be so dramatic,Ally.

561
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,120
People do it all the time.

562
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,870
You should be able to keep your job
and your kid if that's what you want.

563
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,320
Well, I don't have
that choice, do I ?

564
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,790
What Rowland did to me...
to all the girls,

565
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,300
the airline canning Peggy,
the corner they've backed you into...

566
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,500
it's not fair.

567
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,380
You going to take on
Global World Airlines, Ally ?

568
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,730
Well, some of the stews
have been talking.

569
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,050
We're going to start our own union.

570
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,350
We're gonna get out from
under the pilots' thumbs.

571
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,470
When they find out
about this...

572
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,100
Are you crazy ?

573
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,870
I am not telling anyone about this.

574
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,020
And neither are you. Got it ?

575
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,120
The airline had a policy
against pregnancy ?

576
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,340
Pregnancy, marriage, being fat.

577
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,240
Fares were regulated.

578
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,140
The only way they could
compete was 

579
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,341
with the stews they had.

580
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:52,260
Girls Next Door at GWA,
Girls Gone Wild at South Ocean.

581
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,170
One thing they had in common ?

582
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,220
Being available.

583
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,790
The good ol' days.

584
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,450
So what's this about the
stews looking to unionize ?

585
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,290
We'd already let 'em into the
Airline Pilots Association.

586
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,960
We were taking care of them.

587
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,200
Suddenly we didn't have
their best interests in mind.

588
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,380
You ask me,

589
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:15,381
they're nothing
but waitresses in the sky.

590
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,130
Looked for Republican Hotel
employees,

591
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,050
the maid that cleaned the
room the next day-- all dead.

592
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,330
Found another T.C. Bromley off Google.

593
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,810
One-hit wonder author from 1882.

594
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,640
That makes our doer, what, 130 ?

595
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,660
Photos from the Baker-Feldman case.

596
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,250
You came all the way upstairs
for that ?

597
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,120
My legs were falling asleep at my desk.

598
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,370
It's a lucky desk.

599
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,830
You got plans this weekend ?

600
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,400
Not anymore.

601
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,790
Pick me up tomorrow night
at 8:00-- Midvale Hotel.

602
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,120
Landlord's fumigating
my apartment.

603
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,870
The room's on him.

604
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,660
He going to be there, too ?

605
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,590
Don't be late.

606
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,510
What ever happened with
you and your fiance, Helen ?

607
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,910
My fianc...

608
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,320
The medical student from
Detroit you were dating ?

609
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,020
James...

610
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,900
We were never engaged.

611
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,360
Why'd it end ?

612
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,970
Ally tell him about
your trip to Stockholm ?

613
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,350
No.

614
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,730
It ended when I told him I
couldn't have children anymore.

615
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,430
Reason I became a doctor...

616
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,000
So what happened to me
wouldn't happen to other women.

617
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,490
Ally nursed me through
the botched procedure.

618
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,300
She never told a soul.

619
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,550
I'm sorry.

620
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,700
I would've died without her.

621
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,810
Instead...

622
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,620
What happened, Helen ?

623
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,600
When she saw
what happened to me,

624
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:09,501
she said she couldn't sit back
and watch anymore.

625
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,280
Ally had guts.

626
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,150
But people with guts make enemies.

627
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,800
How are you feeling ?

628
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,320
Are you okay ?

629
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,760
Thank you...

630
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,330
for being my friend.

631
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,660
I'm going to take care of you,
do you hear me ?

632
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:36,300
This is your first flight back,
and I want you to take it easy.

633
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,110
I'll get the service started.

634
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,400
Hey, I need you to make sure
tonight's flight is extra smooth.

635
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,810
Helen isn't feeling very well.

636
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,720
What the hell's wrong
with you, Ally ?

637
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,580
What do you mean ?

638
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,240
You didn't really go to
airline personnel, did you ?

639
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,790
Yes. I had a few things
to discuss with them.

640
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,530
Don't you understand
how that looks for me ?

641
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,230
I'm up for my promotion.

642
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,920
What does your promotion have to
do with unfair work conditions ?

643
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,920
They're saying if
I can't control you,

644
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,021
how can I control a 707
with 200 passengers ?

645
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,040
This has nothing to do
with your career,Dean.

646
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,460
People are getting hurt.

647
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,450
Besides, they told me
to take a hike.

648
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,700
They don't care what
we have to say anyway.

649
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,850
Good.

650
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,680
So this is over ?

651
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,910
No.

652
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,610
It's just starting.

653
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,820
No fair play at GWA ?

654
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,850
If you walk out there wearing
that thing, then this is war.

655
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,430
Then war it is.

656
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,870
That was two weeks
before she disappeared.

657
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,910
I always wondered if
he'd gone after her.

658
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,550
Saying Ally was some kind
of feminist ?

659
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,360
Feminists didn't even exist
in 1960.

660
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,660
No, she just believed in fair play.

661
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,260
What happened to Dean's
career after she disappeared ?

662
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,970
A week later, the airline
made the announcement.

663
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,750
He got his promotion.

664
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,220
Yeah.

665
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,880
And Ally got dead.

666
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,190
What is this ? I told t you I was
in Miami that week.

667
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,850
Yeah, we heard that story before.

668
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,580
Along with that song and dance

669
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:24,381
you threw us about
some other bad pilot.

670
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,010
Acting like you were some
patron saint of stewardesses.

671
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,540
- I didn't say that.
- No, you said "this is war".

672
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,760
Right, Dean ?

673
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,720
To Ally.

674
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,990
Woman threatened your
precious promotion.

675
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,830
I was mad. People say stupid
things when they're mad.

676
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,140
Do stupid things, too.

677
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,290
Especially in hotels.

678
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,870
Take things too far.

679
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,500
Ally was a thorn in your side.

680
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,170
Causing you a lot of problems.

681
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,620
You're right.

682
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,830
Problem was, I loved her.

683
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,940
Two lumps.

684
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,630
How you like it, right ?

685
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,870
I have good news.

686
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,540
You grew a conscience ?

687
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,110
They're promoting me to captain.

688
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,970
Be official in two weeks.

689
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,780
Congratulations.

690
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,640
You got everything you wanted.

691
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,000
Not everything.

692
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,530
"Kingdom Afar" ?

693
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,600
You want me to read this
to you ?

694
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,510
Just skip to the part where the prince
and the princess live happily ever after.

695
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,200
Dean...

696
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,280
So ?

697
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,240
Will you ?

698
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,120
No.

699
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,350
I thought that...

700
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,380
You know that I do.

701
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,110
Then say yes.

702
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,260
You're so worked up over
all this union stuff,

703
00:35:08,261 --> 00:35:09,861
the way stews are treated...

704
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,090
I'm offering you a way out.

705
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,990
Pilots are allowed to be
married and have families.

706
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,360
Pilots are allowed
to be older than 32.

707
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,100
Pilots can even flick girls'
girdles

708
00:35:23,101 --> 00:35:24,801
and still keep their jobs.

709
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,870
I'll marry you when the
same is true for stews.

710
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,750
All these years I thought it
was an excuse not to marry me.

711
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,490
That she'd run off with someone else.

712
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,080
You ever see her again
after that ?

713
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
No. I flew to Miami
the next morning.

714
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,870
Spent a week holed up
in my room

715
00:35:43,871 --> 00:35:45,871
with three months' salary
worth of gin.

716
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,080
When I got back, she was gone.

717
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,600
Still buy those monuments
she collected wherever I go.

718
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,470
The book you taped the
ring inside... "Kingdom Afar" ?

719
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,480
It's a fairy tale stews used read
to kids when they were cranky.

720
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,610
Why ?

721
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,420
Written by my new favorite author.

722
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,880
Tracked down the head
of personnel at GWA.

723
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,340
Ally rallied every girl

724
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:11,341
Rowland Hughes ever laid
his hands on.

725
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,630
Threatened to go public unless
the airline got rid of him.

726
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,790
Airline buckled day before
Ally disappeared...

727
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:17,791
November 17, 1960.

728
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,460
Rowland left GWA because
Ally got him fired ?

729
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,860
That type of thing was
unheard of back then,

730
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,090
but Ally knew how much
the press liked stews.

731
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,890
Gives Rowland motive to spare.

732
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,920
Problem is, his alibi checks out.

733
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,610
He was out of the country
November 17th till the 30th.

734
00:36:31,811 --> 00:36:34,211
There's someone else who
has best interests in Rowland career ?

735
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,380
Yup.

736
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,140
And I know who it was.

737
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,200
"Kingdom Afar".

738
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,930
By T.C. Bromley...

739
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,290
our regular at the Republican Hotel. "

740
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,050
"The Prince and the Princess
lived happily ever after..."

741
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,070
"for this is how such things
ought to be."

742
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,830
" Kingdom Afar.

743
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,440
You familiar with it, Gloria ?

744
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,130
What does a children's book
have to do with anything ?

745
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,650
T.C. Bromley... the author ?

746
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,330
Same name as someone

747
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:10,031
who stayed at the Republican Hotel
once a month for ten years.

748
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,790
Distinctive T's and B's...

749
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

750
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,460
I've never stayed at the Republican.

751
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,930
C'mon, Gloria. Got your old files.

752
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,740
Compared your handwriting
with T.C. Bromley's.

753
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,460
It's a perfect match.

754
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,460
There has to be some mistake.

755
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,280
Who were you meeting at the
hotel all those years, Gloria ?

756
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,840
There's no ring on your finger.

757
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,970
Whoever it was never
made you an honest woman.

758
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,180
A lady never tells.

759
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,960
Lady ?

760
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,140
You mean "the other woman" ?

761
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,180
You used an alias 'cause
Rowland Hughes was married.

762
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,800
Rowland Hughes ?

763
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,700
- The pilot ?
- His name's right here.

764
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:53,950
Only paid for the room twice,
two times he signed in.

765
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,170
Real prize, that guy.

766
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,500
You know, I-I talked to him, Gloria.

767
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,470
Gotta say, he must've been
a handsome man.

768
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,470
The pilot on your first flight...

769
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,790
Guy like him...
you never had a chance.

770
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,590
Your first and only.

771
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,410
Prince and princesses...

772
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,340
pilots and stews...

773
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:17,450
1960... that's not a huge leap.

774
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:25,420
"Through darkness and light,
the princess held out hope..."

775
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,220
"like all good princesses should."

776
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,070
You were waiting for
your prince to come,

777
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:43,040
but Rowland Hughes wasn't
prince material,was he?

778
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:47,500
He... just needed a little more time.

779
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,370
To leave his wife ?

780
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,230
Married men don't leave
their wives.

781
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,930
Ever.

782
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,540
I've been there, Gloria.

783
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,320
Gave up six of the
best years of my life.

784
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,270
It was time you didn't have.

785
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,730
Checked your birth records.

786
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,980
Weren't 26 like you said.

787
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,060
You were almost 32,
about to hit that age ceiling.

788
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,920
Then Rowland comes to the hotel.

789
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,340
Tells you he's leaving the airline...

790
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,510
And bam,what little
time you had is gone.

791
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,100
Not only were you losing your job...

792
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,810
You were losing your man.

793
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,310
Thanks to Ally and
her small-town moxie.

794
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,940
She didn't understand.

795
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,350
I'm...

796
00:39:28,251 --> 00:39:30,851
All those terrible things
she was saying about him...

797
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,860
Once Ally put her mind
to something, look out.

798
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,660
But she didn't know him
like I knew him.

799
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:42,290
What kind of a gentleman
he could be.

800
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,700
He took advantage of you, Gloria.

801
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,460
No.

802
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,160
He loved me.

803
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,270
I was his princess...

804
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,510
And she was taking him away.

805
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,930
The purser gave me your letter
when I was leaving the airport.

806
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,260
Yes, thank you for meeting me.

807
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,650
"You're grounded until we talk ?"

808
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,180
Why would you ground me, Gloria ?

809
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,040
Because...

810
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,060
you're spreading lies.

811
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,450
Whatever you told the airline to get
Captain Hughes fired,

812
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,051
I want you to take it back.

813
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,800
But why would you care ?

814
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,770
There's the phone.

815
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,970
If you want to fly again,
you'll tell them the truth.

816
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,710
Captain Hughes is
a perfect gentleman.

817
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,890
Gloria...

818
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,280
are you involved with him ?

819
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,960
Please mind your own business,
Miss Thurston.

820
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,730
But you deserve better.

821
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,860
He's married.

822
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,100
- And the things he's done...
- He's leaving because of you !

823
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,830
No, he was fired,
because he's a menace.

824
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,520
You're only doing this so
Dean can get his pilot seat !

825
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,600
I'm doing this for the stews.

826
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,160
So he'll stop touching them,

827
00:40:56,161 --> 00:40:57,961
stop following them to their rooms
like a wolf...

828
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,030
You watch your mouth !

829
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,190
You just can't see him for who
he is because he's using you.

830
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,220
This is your fault !

831
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,330
You're taking him from me !

832
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,380
He's never going to leave
his wife, Gloria.

833
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,960
He's only waiting for you
to age out.

834
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,390
Take it back !

835
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,000
Now !

836
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,910
No, I can't do that.

837
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,950
We've come too far.

838

<i>"Someone to watch over me"
