00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,616
Cold case

2
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:07,217
****************

3
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:15,218
<i>"Feel the Pain"
by Dinosaur, Jr.</i>

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,221
Pretty cool.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,631
Super skater.

6
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:45,222
He got any special powers ?

7
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:47,164
He can defenitely go invisible.

8
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:49,695
- How 'bout flying ?
- Only on his board.

9
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:52,831
Without the board he's normal,
like us.

10
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,679
How long they been at it ?

11
00:00:58,471 --> 00:00:59,901
Just started.

12
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:02,460
I got out like you said.
Followed the rules.

13
00:01:02,517 --> 00:01:04,352
Always the same with you.

14
00:01:04,353 --> 00:01:05,410
Yeah ?!

15
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:11,481
What the hell you looking at ?

16
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:13,264
Baby, please.

17
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:16,640
You got something
you wanna say to me, boy ?

18
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,411
Oh, want another piece of me ?
Come on.

19
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,817
Baby, come back
inside, okay ?

20
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:28,657
I thought so.

21
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,255
Get in the damn house.

22
00:01:37,928 --> 00:01:39,958
Remember the rules, okay ?

23
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:25,130
It's getting like
south beach in here.

24
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,955
Ac busted again?

25
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,762
Cost-cutting measure.

26
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:29,791
City wants us
to make do with fans.

27
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,892
I need you to field
this one for me.

28
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:33,873
Something wrong, boss ?

29
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,461
Besides spending
the rest of my morning

30
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:37,294
filling out budget reports?

31
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:40,048
- This a grounder or a mystery ?
- M.E.'s office

32
00:02:40,148 --> 00:02:41,828
kicked him to us.
Thinks he has info

33
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,777
on a John Doe murder
in Brewerytown in '95.

34
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:51,550
Lilly Rush.

35
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,658
My partner, scotty valens.

36
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:55,427
Hi. Mick simpson.

37
00:02:55,462 --> 00:02:56,720
Told you got
information

38
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,022
on a john doe murder.

39
00:02:58,122 --> 00:03:00,696
My brother, Nash.
Ran away spring of '95.

40
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:02,191
I never heard
from him again.

41
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:04,164
Ran away from where?

42
00:03:04,222 --> 00:03:05,787
Gloucester city, new jersey.

43
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,129
Things at home were, uh...

44
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:09,362
Tough ?

45
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:11,554
Checked with the coroner,

46
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:15,230
said you had a white
male listed back then

47
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:16,658
about the same age
as my brother.

48
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,655
What makes you think
it's your brother ?

49
00:03:18,863 --> 00:03:21,263
My mother just got sent
to court-ordered detox

50
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:22,261
and then jail.

51
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:24,860
Cleaning out the house to put it
on the market and we found this.

52
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,608
Gonna need to connect
the dots for us, Mick.

53
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,085
Well, my brother sent this
from Philly.

54
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:32,973
It's postmarked
the second week of june.

55
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:34,048
There's no note in the box ?

56
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:36,641
Just the skateboard.
Must've been for my birthday.

57
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:38,890
Your mom neglected
to give it to you ?

58
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,256
Probably figured I'd use it
to run away, like Nash did.

59
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,765
It's not him ?

60
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,206
Pretty extensive decomp.

61
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:48,129
We're gonna need
more than a postmark

62
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,930
and an old photo
to reopen the case.

63
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:51,196
Dental or medical records.

64
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,595
I don't have those.

65
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,096
There's nothing else
in the file ?

66
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:56,128
Brown-bag special.

67
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:58,494
Miscellaneous evidence found
at the scene.

68
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:03,491
Well, I'd like to see
whatever it is ?
We don't normally...

69
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:05,464
It's okay.

70
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:09,562
My mother had a string
of loser boyfriends...

71
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:12,863
Not to mention problems
of her own.

72
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,110
That why your brother left ?

73
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:17,523
He was older.

74
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:18,978
It was worse for him.

75
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:22,588
I always thought
he'd come back
and take me away
with him.

76
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:30,732
Recognize anything ?

77
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:36,783
Super skater.

78
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:39,128
Mean something ?

79
00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:42,216
It's from my sketch book.

80
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:48,081
I gave that to him
the day he ran away.

81
00:04:53,362 --> 00:04:55,649
Well, looks like we might've
found your brother.

82
00:04:56,168 --> 00:05:00,179
Cold Case
Season 7 Episode 2

83
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:27,808
Hoodrats

84
00:05:31,863 --> 00:05:34,014
Nash simpson, 17 years old.

85
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:36,528
ME estimates he was killed
the last week of june.

86
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,978
Blunt-force trauma,
head and neck.

87
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:41,548
Body was dumped down
a vent pipe in brewerytown.

88
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:43,405
Wasn't discovered
until july.

89
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:44,830
Filed as a john doe

90
00:05:44,865 --> 00:05:47,621
due to extensive decomp,
lack of evidence.

91
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:49,791
The assigned back in the
day hit a quick dead end--

92
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,912
No id, zero witnesses.

93
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:54,969
Kid jumped by a homeless guy,
or a drug score gone bad ?

94
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:58,089
Tox reports didn't find any
drugs or alcohol in his system.

95
00:05:58,289 --> 00:05:59,557
Brother Mick confirmed Nash

96
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:02,469
ran away from home in march
after one too many bouts

97
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:03,442
with mom's boyfriend.

98
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:05,021
Spoke to mom in lockup

99
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:08,564
over in Jersey, a real peach.
Chelsey simpson.

100
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:10,239
Told her what happened
to Nash,

101
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,344
got crickets.

102
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:12,268
What about the boyfriend ?

103
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:13,768
Croaked Hep-c.

104
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:15,318
Real tragedy.

105
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:17,213
The last contact mick had was
a box

106
00:06:17,313 --> 00:06:20,837
his brother sent from Philly,
postmarked june ninth.

107
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:22,690
The thing's got some heft.

108
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,324
Blunt-force trauma, huh ?

109
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:26,575
Have forensics take
a look at that, Lilly.

110
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:28,328
Got a hit on Nash.

111
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:30,542
Issued a bench warrant
for failure to appear

112
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:32,833
on a summary citation
in the ninth district.

113
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:35,608
City code violation 3261.

114
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:38,336
Skateboarding on city property,
public nuisance.

115
00:06:38,738 --> 00:06:41,462
Arresting officer, Joe Mueller.

116
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:43,086
Nightstick Joe.

117
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:43,811
Know him ?

118
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:45,372
Still on the beat.

119
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:47,636
I'll have him come in.
See what he remembers.

120
00:06:52,693 --> 00:06:53,709
Mijo.

121
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,722
Viejo,what are you doing here ?

122
00:06:58,278 --> 00:06:59,518
- How are ya ?
- Fine.

123
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:02,536
I was in the area,
figured I'd bring these down.

124
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:06,301
Cross-trainers.
Buy one, get the second pair half price.

125
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:08,177
Figured you could use 'em.

126
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,006
Thanks, pops. Uh...

127
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:11,130
You got a minute ?

128
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,002
Yeah, sure.

129
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:15,172
Did you want some
coffee, or... ?

130
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:16,518
No, thank you.

131
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:21,143
Talk to your mother lately ?

132
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:23,060
Yeah, last week. Why ?

133
00:07:23,774 --> 00:07:25,171
Probably nothing.

134
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:28,511
You came all the way down here
to give me a pair of sneakers ?

135
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:29,213
Come on.

136
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:32,289
She's acting funny.

137
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:34,226
Isn't where she says she is.

138
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:36,622
And when I ask, she lies.

139
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,164
She's taking tai chi
in the park.

140
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:41,272
For God's sake,
does that sound like your mother ?

141
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,410
Tai chi ?

142
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,845
Says it relaxes her.

143
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,261
Do you want me
to check on her ?

144
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,219
I don't know.

145
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,018
Maybe call her,

146
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:57,053
but don't tell her
we talked, okay ?

147
00:08:08,118 --> 00:08:10,845
Done all right for yourself, John.
Makes me wish
I'd taken a few tests.

148
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,599
It's never too late, Joe.

149
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:14,445
Are you kidding me ?

150
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,840
They just took away
all my overtime.

151
00:08:16,926 --> 00:08:18,960
Hear there's a big shake-up
going downtown with the brass.

152
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,357
It's above my pay grade.

153
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:21,546
Yeah, mine, too.

154
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:24,403
So what can I do for ya, Johnny ?

155
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:28,260
A citation you wrote for
a Nash Simpson,

156
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,906
march, 1995.

157
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:33,203
Know how many citations
I've written, honey ?

158
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:34,775
It's detective rush.

159
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,141
Ten years on the job.

160
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:38,663
And this kid ended up dead
in Brewerytown.

161
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:39,995
Runaway.

162
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:41,723
City chews up runaways.

163
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:44,275
I remember this kid.

164
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:46,077
One of those Love Park hoodrats.

165
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,843
Cops ! Cops ! Run !

166
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:53,686
I.d., numbnuts !

167
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,212
No skate parks in Jersey ?

168
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:04,681
You got a place to stay ?

169
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:06,650
No.

170
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:08,362
You can't sleep in the park.

171
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:09,309
I know.

172
00:09:09,344 --> 00:09:11,643
- Not supposed to skate here neither.
- Run !

173
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:14,843
Run, run, run !

174
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:20,948
Son of a bitch !

175
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,482
Yeah, my sergeant ripped me
a fresh one

176
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:25,149
over the damage to my vehicle.

177
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:27,787
- Who was the other kid ?
- Cal...

178
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:30,744
Something mexican.
I can look it up,
if you want.

179
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:32,409
- Bad news ?
- Possession,

180
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:34,110
theft, vandalism.

181
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:35,270
I caught up with him.

182
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:37,910
We had a discussion
about the error of his ways,

183
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,642
if you catch my drift.

184
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:44,200
Next week's
better for me.

185
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,390
Right.
Talk to you then.

186
00:09:47,376 --> 00:09:48,642
Your old man ?

187
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:52,144
Yeah. Wants me
to meet the family.

188
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:53,906
Yeah.

189
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,576
The one with the ink.

190
00:09:57,576 --> 00:09:58,949
Cal Acevedo ?

191
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,142
Depends.

192
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:04,877
Nightstick Joe says hello.

193
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,112
Ring a bell ?

194
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:09,413
More like rang mine a few times.
Guy had it out for skaters.

195
00:10:09,437 --> 00:10:12,325
Ever skate in Brewerytown
in an old cement factory ?

196
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:14,881
Nah, nothing to skate there.
Love Park was the spot.

197
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,947
How about Nash Simpson ?

198
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:20,603
Haven't heard that name
in a while.

199
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:22,075
But you guys were buds, right ?

200
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,874
Long time ago, but yeah,
we skated.

201
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:27,843
Nash's body was dumped there
in '95.

202
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:33,543
Always figured
he split town.

203
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:34,742
What made you figure that ?

204
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:36,044
He was always talking
about going to California.

205
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,876
Figured that's just where
he ended up.

206
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,908
- He running from something ?
- Just home.

207
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:41,874
Any idea what Nash was doing
in Brewerytown ?

208
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,275
Looking to score ?

209
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,176
Nah, drugs were my cross,
not his.

210
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:47,743
Skaters can be
pretty harsh, man.

211
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:48,475
Fights ?

212
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,258
Happens.
Nash was from Jersey.

213
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,643
Dudes 'round here didn't want
the park blown out.

214
00:10:52,678 --> 00:10:54,543
But me and Nash had
each other's backs.

215
00:10:56,544 --> 00:10:59,544
<i>"Skull" by Sebadoh.</i>

216
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,941
- Where we gonna crash tonight ?
- Something will turn up.

217
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:06,482
Right now my wheels
are flatspotted.
Need new ones.

218
00:11:06,677 --> 00:11:07,766
Dude, I don't know.

219
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:08,748
Watch.

220
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:15,321
- You bang it, you buy it.
- Yeah, yeah.

221
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:18,545
Whoa! Dude's got vert playing.

222
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,523
Haven't seen that in a while.

223
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:22,622
You know him ?

224
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,862
Yes. Grady Giles.
Calls himself "double g" now.

225
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:27,695
He good ?

226
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,361
Best in philly.

227
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:40,247
- Planning on paying for those ?
- What ?

228
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:49,696
Don't bring your crap
in here again.

229
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:51,394
Stealing from
another skater.

230
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:54,096
- Where's your head at ?
- I was gonna put them back.

231
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:56,055
You can tell that to the cops.

232
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:57,907
Whoa, relax, man.
We paid for it.

233
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:12,246
Bailed me out big time.
That was his last 20 bucks.

234
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:13,388
Who's Batman ?

235
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,000
Old vert dog named Hess,
owned the shop.

236
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,500
Course, he threw me out.

237
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:20,243
- Just you ?
- Yeah, Hess liked Nash.

238
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:23,223
Uh, let him crash in the
basement, had him do odd jobs.

239
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:25,452
- How come you didn't stay there ?
- Did a few times,

240
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:27,700
but the guy was always trying
to take pictures of us.

241
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:28,396
Pictures ?

242
00:12:28,396 --> 00:12:31,212
30-year-old guy taking pictures
of shirtless skaters ?

243
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:32,636
Creepy.

244
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:43,642
Let me guess.

245
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:45,578
You're not looking
for boards.

246
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,861
You see one like this before ?

247
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:48,761
No.

248
00:12:48,796 --> 00:12:51,484
Belonged to Nash Simpson.
Remember him ?

249
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,264
Back when, yeah.

250
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:54,396
Good kid.

251
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:55,683
Let him sleep in the shop.

252
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:58,957
Just for a couple of months.
Let lots of skaters crash here.

253
00:12:58,971 --> 00:13:01,148
In exchange for what ?

254
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:02,350
What's this about ?

255
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,543
Nash was killed back in '95.

256
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:05,956
Body dumped
in Brewerytown.

257
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:08,197
You like young boys
hanging around, huh ?

258
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:09,596
Huh ? No.

259
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:11,544
Wait a minute, who...
Who told you that crap ?

260
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:12,731
Cal Acevedo.

261
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:13,457
No...

262
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:15,332
Said you took
a special interest in Nash.

263
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:17,231
The guy was a junkie, man.

264
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:18,412
Nash go down that path ?

265
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:20,457
- Not that I remember.
- We're trying to figure out

266
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:22,185
your relationship to him.

267
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:25,031
Look, man, Philly was blowing up

268
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:26,179
'cause of my shop.

269
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,732
And the connections
I had out west

270
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:31,225
brought attention
to a lot of good skaters.

271
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:33,106
- Nash one of em ?
- Should have been.

272
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:35,500
He did stuff back in '95

273
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:37,301
dudes are still trying today.

274
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,901
<i>"Start Choppin"
by Dinosaur Jr.</i>

275
00:13:52,913 --> 00:13:54,842
You messed up my line, kook.

276
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:55,795
Come on, Grady.

277
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,128
Go back where you came from.

278
00:13:57,944 --> 00:13:59,998
Didn't mean to get in the way
of your... Smith grind.

279
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,099
Smith Grind.

280
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,398
Smith grind ?
More like smith grind,

281
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,608
kickflip out.

282
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,665
Fool's gonna
break his face.

283
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,329
That was for free !

284
00:14:44,364 --> 00:14:45,765
And a broken board,
no doubt !

285
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,429
- You get that ?
- Got it.

286
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:55,429
Come on, man.

287
00:14:56,035 --> 00:14:58,123
See, Grady thought
he was top dog.

288
00:14:58,223 --> 00:15:01,524
Didn't like Nash coming out
of nowhere, showing him up.

289
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,157
Grady big-time now ?

290
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:05,096
Yeah. Big-time sellout.

291
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:08,263
You can buy his board
at Blue Mart.

292
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:10,029
Dude forgot where he came from.

293
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:12,931
Nash steal Grady's girl
like he stole his thunder ?

294
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:15,718
I remember her
coming around the shop,

295
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:17,602
trying to get
Nash's attention.

296
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:19,188
You saying Grady
came after him ?

297
00:15:19,388 --> 00:15:21,548
All I know is
after Nash split,

298
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:24,583
Vonda got right
back in line.

299
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:44,747
We don't want none.

300
00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:46,583
How about some of this ?

301
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:50,885
My bad.

302
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,378
Thought you was Jehovah's.

303
00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:56,004
Investigating
Nash Simpson's murder.

304
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:59,423
Sorry to hear that,
haven't seen that guy in years.

305
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:00,904
Yeah, when was that ?

306
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:02,029
huh ?

307
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,297
Last time you saw him ?

308
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:07,026
Uh, like, way before our
wonderful mayor decided

309
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:08,923
to ban skateboarding
back in '01.

310
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:09,913
Well, what about Brewerytown ?

311
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:10,949
What about it ?

312
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:12,998
It's where Nash's body turned up.

313
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:14,899
News to me.

314
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,666
Well, here's another
headline, hotshot.

315
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:19,351
Heard he was
tapping your girl,
Vonda.

316
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,034
-Trying to ambush me ? / - We're gonna
do a whole lot more than that,

317
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,133
you don't drop the
amnesiac jackass bit

318
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:27,051
and start answering
our questions.

319
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,999
Listen. Dude was good.

320
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:32,366
Considering he was
a kook from Jersey.

321
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:34,525
I tried to throw
his boys a bone.

322
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,900
Fools couldn't get
out of their own way.

323
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:40,364
20 bucks a deck.
You need one of these, bro.

324
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:43,679
Fool went and put
rims on his ride.

325
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,535
Where'd Grady get
all that gear?

326
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:47,302
Accelerator sponsored him.

327
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:53,061
What's up, fellas ? Got two boards
left from my package.

328
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:56,034
Tail's too square.

329
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:58,532
At least I got boards.

330
00:16:58,532 --> 00:17:00,133
It's called,
"being sponsored."

331
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,267
I go pro, I'll be seeing ya.

332
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:05,559
No thanks, man.
We're working on our thing.

333
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,155
Yeah, like,
top secret, right ?

334
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:11,351
Said we already got our own thing.
We don't need to be riding your decks.

335
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:13,778
All right.
Well, good luck to you.

336
00:17:23,814 --> 00:17:25,245
Real big of you,

337
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,346
considering Nash
was getting with your girl.

338
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,512
Come on, man.
She came back.
They always do.

339
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:33,013
- Didn't stick ?
- No, no, no.

340
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,044
Had to kick her to the curb

341
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,346
'cause she couldn't fathom
the level I operate on.

342
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,778
Hey.
Check out the kicks.

343
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:41,644
New colorway we're launching

344
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,546
with the, uh, video
game, energy drink.

345
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:45,180
Whole package.

346
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:47,107
Rad.

347
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:03,410
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right.

348
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:09,694
Something wrong ?

349
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:11,646
Your hair...

350
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:15,413
Your father doesn't like it.

351
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:17,830
- It's different.
- Oh, you, too, now ?

352
00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:19,898
Looks good.

353
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,045
All right.

354
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,396
Enough with the interrogation.

355
00:18:25,431 --> 00:18:27,074
I know he put
you up to this.

356
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,865
What, I can't have lunch
with my own mother ?

357
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:33,199
Now I know you're lying.

358
00:18:34,582 --> 00:18:36,013
He's just worried.

359
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:40,413
The man worries
about everything.

360
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:41,813
I'm fine.

361
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:45,046
Tai chi ?

362
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:51,118
It helps me get centered.

363
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:53,468
Centered ?

364
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:59,144
So, you know this
instructor, or..

365
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,582
You and your father need
to mind your own business.

366
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,080
Do you have any more questions,

367
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,181
or can we order ?

368
00:19:19,513 --> 00:19:21,112
Thanks for coming in, Vonda.

369
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:23,177
You teach photography now ?

370
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:26,846
Uh, photography, digital arts.
Pays the bills.

371
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:28,547
Got an old photo here.

372
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:31,346
Thought you could analyze
this for us.

373
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,944
Nash.

374
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:36,212
What is this about ?

375
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:39,597
Him winding up dead in
Brewerytown back in '95.

376
00:19:39,697 --> 00:19:41,646
- Dead ?
- He was your boyfriend, right ?

377
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,245
We weren't that serious.

378
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,521
When was the last time
you saw Nash ?

379
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,908
End of june, I think.

380
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:51,012
And you thought what, exactly,
when he disappeared ?

381
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:52,611
Stupid.

382
00:19:52,646 --> 00:19:54,413
I let him borrow
my video camera.

383
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:56,145
And I thought he used me.

384
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,680
'cause I-I knew how bad
he needed that money.

385
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:13,013
What's with you
and that logo ?

386
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:15,513
What's with you
and that camera ?

387
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:16,916
I see things.

388
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:18,919
- Like what ?
- I don't know.

389
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,602
Like the way you skate.
Nobody has control like you.

390
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:24,963
That a good thing ?

391
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:28,202
You attack it.

392
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:33,003
I mean, somehow,
you make it look beautiful.

393
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:39,152
I don't really
think about it.

394
00:20:39,392 --> 00:20:40,909
I just do it.

395
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,810
<i>"Leg" by Bettie Serveert.</i>

396
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:51,147
The logo ?

397
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:57,119
My brother made it up.

398
00:20:57,644 --> 00:20:59,184
You have a brother ?

399
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:01,119
He's 13.

400
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:04,586
I haven't seen him
since I split home.

401
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,862
He's so talented.

402
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:09,232
If you miss him so much, why
don't you just go back home ?

403
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,575
Just make things
worse for him.

404
00:21:12,282 --> 00:21:13,756
I got to get him
out of there.

405
00:21:14,454 --> 00:21:16,502
Well, you could have
him live with you.

406
00:21:16,982 --> 00:21:19,211
I sleep on the floor.
I got no money.

407
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,072
Here.

408
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,470
What's this for ?

409
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:34,657
Film a part.

410
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:37,358
Send a "sponsor me"
video to a California company.

411
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,082
I don't know.

412
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:44,084
Nash, it doesn't...

413
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:46,851
Doesn't matter how good you are
if you don't show anyone.

414
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:50,084
I'm working on something.

415
00:21:51,984 --> 00:21:53,367
I want to see.

416
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:54,715
Not ready yet.

417
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,909
But when it is,
you'll be the first.

418
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:01,500
You promise ?

419
00:22:05,084 --> 00:22:06,358
Promise.

420
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,051
The way that he skated,

421
00:22:18,084 --> 00:22:20,646
Nash would have been bigger
than Grady.

422
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:22,582
He wanted to get
his brother to Philly ?

423
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:25,599
He couldn't get custody unless
he had a source of income.

424
00:22:25,634 --> 00:22:27,748
A good video
with a few bangers,

425
00:22:27,783 --> 00:22:29,271
you could really make
a name for yourself.

426
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:30,264
Bangers ?

427
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:31,453
Tricks.

428
00:22:31,803 --> 00:22:36,337
Guys would spend weeks trying
to nail a trick perfectly.

429
00:22:36,372 --> 00:22:37,902
That how Grady made
his name ?

430
00:22:37,937 --> 00:22:40,796
Yeah, I have boxes of tapes
of Grady trying

431
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,277
the most ridiculous tricks
over and over again.

432
00:22:43,377 --> 00:22:46,172
- Any footage of Nash ?
- Maybe.

433
00:22:46,273 --> 00:22:48,473
I haven't watched those
in years.

434
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:50,726
We'd like to take
a look at those.

435
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,735
Scotty, you, uh,

436
00:22:56,185 --> 00:22:58,350
you requisition
a new fax machine ?

437
00:22:58,448 --> 00:23:00,893
- It's broken.
- Yeah. Request denied.

438
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,813
We switching to pigeons ?

439
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,080
Budget cuts. We're gonna
have to make do.

440
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,994
If that's another
expense sheet, lil...

441
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:09,332
Phone records.
Got a call from the skate shop

442
00:23:09,432 --> 00:23:11,614
in Jersey right before
Nash was killed.

443
00:23:11,714 --> 00:23:14,765
And next day, Nash's mom,
Chelsey, and the boyfriend Rafe,

444
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:16,477
took a road trip to Philly.

445
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:17,908
Ran their names, got a hit.

446
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:20,743
Rafe stockton got into a bar
fight in Brewerytown.

447
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:22,260
Rearranged some guy's face.

448
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:24,308
Booked for
disorderly conduct.

449
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:27,076
Simple assault charge
got thrown out.

450
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:30,941
All right, pay mom a visit,

451
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:34,042
see what happened
at the family reunion.

452
00:23:58,543 --> 00:24:00,909
You lied to us, Chelsey.

453
00:24:00,944 --> 00:24:02,289
What about it ?

454
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:03,799
You and Rafe were in Philly

455
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,487
the week
your son was murdered.

456
00:24:08,976 --> 00:24:10,410
Yeah, well, I don't have
to talk to you.

457
00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:12,301
No, you don't.
It's just your kid who's dead.

458
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:14,622
And yet you keep
jerking us around.

459
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:16,970
Keep it up, I'll have the DA
pile on conspiracy,

460
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,044
- and extend your stay.
- Not like I got anything

461
00:24:19,045 --> 00:24:20,545
waiting for me out there.

462
00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:25,663
Well, there's always vodka.

463
00:24:26,794 --> 00:24:28,702
My mom liked hers straight,

464
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,360
you know, in those plastic bottles

465
00:24:31,395 --> 00:24:33,370
that don't break
when you pass out.

466
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:35,554
Gin.

467
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,696
Hey I get it... I mean,

468
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:44,045
my mom was no June Cleaver.

469
00:24:44,228 --> 00:24:46,059
The messed-up thing was...

470
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:49,293
I still loved her.

471
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,635
And in her own way,

472
00:24:52,512 --> 00:24:53,987
she loved me.

473
00:24:55,506 --> 00:24:56,916
What do you want from me ?

474
00:24:57,016 --> 00:24:59,279
I want to know why you went
to Philly.

475
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:04,055
Because I missed my son.

476
00:25:09,356 --> 00:25:10,789
Hey, baby.

477
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,190
Where's Mick ?
Thought you were gonna bring him.

478
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:21,356
I couldn't. Uh...

479
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,421
Rafe is here, isn't he ?

480
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,557
I told him to stay in the car.

481
00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:30,024
You're wrong about him.

482
00:25:30,124 --> 00:25:33,579
Okay, I mean, he's, he's got me
on the straight and narrow.

483
00:25:33,882 --> 00:25:35,342
Is that why you smell like gin ?

484
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:39,536
You ask me to come all this way
so you can judge me ?

485
00:25:42,212 --> 00:25:44,369
I want Mick to come live
with me.

486
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:46,175
What ?

487
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:51,537
You don't know the first thing
about raising a kid like Mick.

488
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:52,914
And you do ?

489
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:55,278
I'm gonna get a place of my own.
I got money.

490
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:56,381
Money from what ?

491
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:57,669
Skating.

492
00:25:57,864 --> 00:25:59,131
Right.

493
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:01,954
Look, I got a sponsor.

494
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:07,513
Hey, baby, how about giving me
some of that money, 'cause... ?

495
00:26:11,427 --> 00:26:13,637
Did you ever give Mick
that board I sent ?

496
00:26:14,215 --> 00:26:15,835
Uh... I will, I will.

497
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,534
That was the last time
I ever saw him.

498
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:31,325
He got money from a sponsor ?

499
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:33,974
Never made any sense to me.

500
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:37,823
I know he was living outta some
skateboard shop.

501
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:43,231
- Guy named Hess ?
- Could be.

502
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:46,357
Not a day goes by

503
00:26:46,392 --> 00:26:50,226
that I don't think about
what I did to those boys.

504
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:55,091
Make it quick, Scotty.

505
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:57,192
They're waiting for me
on the fifth floor.

506
00:26:57,227 --> 00:26:58,558
Something going down ?

507
00:26:58,593 --> 00:27:00,426
I'm not goin'
for the coffee.

508
00:27:00,461 --> 00:27:02,224
Tracked down the
manufacturer

509
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:04,291
on the skateboard
Nash sent his brother.

510
00:27:04,326 --> 00:27:07,441
Board was a protype,
custom-designed by Hess.

511
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:10,434
The first order was
for 200 blanks.

512
00:27:10,534 --> 00:27:11,884
Hess bet big on Nash.

513
00:27:11,984 --> 00:27:13,561
Same guy was singing
the blues about how

514
00:27:13,661 --> 00:27:15,216
big money ruined
the sport.

515
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:18,404
Yeah, but the manufacturer
said Hess canceled the order

516
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:20,495
june 29 and refused
to pay the rest of his bill.

517
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:22,076
Yeah, took him
to small claims court.

518
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:24,275
After that, Hess
claims bankruptcy.

519
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,027
And Nash winds up dead.

520
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,194
So why're you still standing
here telling me about it ?

521
00:27:30,238 --> 00:27:31,704
What's eating the boss ?

522
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:33,135
Doherty just got appointed

523
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,266
to oversee
the detective's bureau.

524
00:27:40,603 --> 00:27:42,475
Wondering if you could
make me one like this.

525
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,102
Capitalize on the sport,

526
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:46,879
but then again it might be
a little late for that.

527
00:27:46,923 --> 00:27:48,214
I get by.

528
00:27:48,362 --> 00:27:50,362
Don't wanna sell out,
is that it ?

529
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:53,062
Seems you were ready
to back in '95.

530
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:54,336
Lot of boards.

531
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,390
More than I could sell.

532
00:27:57,529 --> 00:27:58,794
Nash woulda
helped with that.

533
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:02,225
Seeing as how you'd tapped him
to be a star.

534
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,602
Never happened.

535
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:06,065
Why is that, Hess ?

536
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:09,864
People, people forget.

537
00:28:09,963 --> 00:28:12,762
This is the place
where it all started.

538
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,568
Without my shop,

539
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:18,169
Philly never woulda taken off.

540
00:28:18,904 --> 00:28:20,597
I had a plan, too,

541
00:28:20,696 --> 00:28:23,430
till somebody beat me
to the punch.

542
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,326
Hey, check this out.

543
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:38,267
Just like the one
you sent your brother,

544
00:28:38,845 --> 00:28:41,263
but this one's got
a carbon-fiber ply

545
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:42,721
in between the wood.

546
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,474
Impossible to break, man.

547
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:46,020
Cool.

548
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:50,488
These are high-end blanks, man,
not some chinese crap.

549
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:51,736
It's all coming together.

550
00:28:52,157 --> 00:28:52,949
Really ?

551
00:28:53,256 --> 00:28:55,284
Yeah, man !
And check it,

552
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:57,488
your name's gonna be
on every board.

553
00:28:57,723 --> 00:28:59,002
Gonna do it right,

554
00:28:59,423 --> 00:29:00,935
soon as I get the funds.

555
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,605
That sounds awesome, but, um,

556
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:07,214
i'm-i'm just getting started.

557
00:29:07,249 --> 00:29:09,789
And this is how you do it, man.

558
00:29:09,824 --> 00:29:12,789
I'll be your sponsor.
We'll keep it east coast.

559
00:29:12,824 --> 00:29:13,720
I can't.

560
00:29:13,755 --> 00:29:15,388
Don't tell me you're not ready.

561
00:29:15,423 --> 00:29:17,020
You're better
than everyone in Philly.

562
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:20,953
That's not it.
I already got a sponsor.

563
00:29:23,655 --> 00:29:24,754
What ?

564
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:27,104
Accelerator.

565
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:31,154
Skated a live demo for them.

566
00:29:31,254 --> 00:29:33,071
They're gonna hook me up
with a board.

567
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:36,520
When ?

568
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:38,122
Yesterday.

569
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:40,114
Love Park.

570
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,648
I couldn't wait.

571
00:29:43,555 --> 00:29:46,022
If you needed money, man,
all you had to do was ask.

572
00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:47,622
You can barely make
the rent, Hess.

573
00:29:47,657 --> 00:29:49,487
I didn't wanna.

574
00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:53,288
Look, I'm sorry,
but I gotta take my shot now.

575
00:29:57,857 --> 00:30:00,121
After all I've done for you ?

576
00:30:00,722 --> 00:30:04,722
<i>"Palomine" by Bettie Serveert.</i>

577
00:30:05,757 --> 00:30:07,323
Just get the hell out.

578
00:30:18,056 --> 00:30:21,578
It's a matter of time
before he got snapped up.

579
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,355
Bunch of corporate sharks

580
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:27,756
buying street cred.

581
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,154
Accelerator was
Grady's sponsor.

582
00:30:30,189 --> 00:30:31,955
Made a lot of money
off those kids.

583
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:33,522
You weren't trying
to do the same thing ?

584
00:30:33,557 --> 00:30:35,655
My stuff had integrity.

585
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:36,820
Maybe.

586
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:38,689
But you never saw him again ?

587
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:42,768
Can't say I blame him.

588
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:45,978
I was small-time.

589
00:30:48,855 --> 00:30:50,797
Guess I'll always be.

590
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:56,556
Found some interesting stuff
on these tapes, Vonda.

591
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:58,889
Need you to put it
together for us.

592
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:01,855
You recognize that ?

593
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,676
Grady. A long time ago.

594
00:31:03,776 --> 00:31:04,946
Summer of '95.

595
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:07,869
Time code has him doing this
july 26.

596
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:09,487
Kept doing it
over and over,

597
00:31:09,587 --> 00:31:11,307
but never quite nailed
that banger, though.

598
00:31:11,407 --> 00:31:13,520
Must've been something
he was working on.

599
00:31:14,224 --> 00:31:16,089
Tape was in the box
you gave us.

600
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,454
Some of those
were Grady's.

601
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:20,543
After we broke up, he was too famous
to move his stuff out.

602
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:23,956
What about this ?

603
00:31:23,991 --> 00:31:25,388
Nash.

604
00:31:26,707 --> 00:31:27,586
Same trick.

605
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:30,724
Same place
where we found Nash's body.

606
00:31:31,064 --> 00:31:33,202
Time code has Nash
doing this trick

607
00:31:33,302 --> 00:31:34,858
june 27.

608
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:37,024
Nash did it first ?

609
00:31:37,024 --> 00:31:38,072
And better.

610
00:31:38,256 --> 00:31:40,477
A month before yo-yo Grady
even tried it.

611
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:42,021
Only Nash nailed it.

612
00:31:42,056 --> 00:31:43,810
So Grady stole his trick.

613
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:45,754
But Grady got all
the marbles.

614
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:47,789
Blew up, became
the big man on the scene.

615
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:49,923
Nothing but a thief.

616
00:31:50,264 --> 00:31:51,762
Or a killer.

617
00:32:00,689 --> 00:32:02,221
Tough trick.

618
00:32:03,556 --> 00:32:06,386
Yeah, gotta innovate
and elevate. It's what I do.

619
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,719
Didn't bring you down here
to admire your innovations.

620
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:11,664
Remember where
that was, Grady ?

621
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:15,906
Oh, some warehouse.
That trick was too sketchy.

622
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:19,225
Good thing Vonda held onto it
after you kicked her to the curb.

623
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:21,302
Know what's on this ?

624
00:32:25,058 --> 00:32:27,364
Check it, man.
I look like one of your psychic friends ?

625
00:32:29,956 --> 00:32:32,072
It's bad luck wearing
a hat inside.

626
00:32:32,072 --> 00:32:33,535
It's a tape of Nash

627
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:34,594
in Brewerytown.

628
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:35,414
Yeah ?

629
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:37,282
Yeah, same warehouse.

630
00:32:37,382 --> 00:32:40,622
One month prior to the one
you made
trying that exact same trick.

631
00:32:40,657 --> 00:32:42,155
Not being psychic,
but I'd say

632
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,622
your future's
mandatory ten-year jolt.

633
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:47,616
That's kook, man. You're saying
I killed him over that trick ?

634
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,455
I told you,
it was too sketchy.

635
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,580
He took your girl Vonda.
You stole his trick.

636
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,956
You saw him stick it.
Decided to take it for yourself.

637
00:32:53,991 --> 00:32:55,585
No, no, man.
Wasn't like that.

638
00:32:55,585 --> 00:32:57,403
No, you came out top
dog on the east coast.

639
00:32:57,403 --> 00:33:00,403
Hooked up with a big-time
sponsor, you never looked back.

640
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:02,048
The only way you could
have this tape of Nash

641
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,277
was if you were
there that night.

642
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:06,027
And we got your lying ass,
same location.

643
00:33:08,941 --> 00:33:09,856
Look...

644
00:33:11,894 --> 00:33:13,148
Truth ?

645
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,093
I tried to snake
the trick, all right ?

646
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:19,022
But only off the tape.

647
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:20,723
The tape ? What are
you talking about ?

648
00:33:20,723 --> 00:33:22,881
I was never there
when he hit the trick, man.

649
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:25,793
I wish I was.

650
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:34,912
Damn, how'd he do that ?

651
00:33:35,408 --> 00:33:37,111
It don't matter 'cause he split.

652
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,223
And what are you
showing me this for ?

653
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,365
- You can do it.
- Nah.

654
00:33:42,175 --> 00:33:44,865
- You can just add that double G style.
- Yeah. Why don't you bust it ?

655
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:46,509
Look, you want the tape or not ?

656
00:33:46,772 --> 00:33:48,018
50 bucks.

657
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:54,029
First I got to know
where this is at.
Come on, man.
I need the money.

658
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:59,357
Only got $40.

659
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:01,345
Brewerytown.

660
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,512
A warehouse we found.

661
00:34:03,817 --> 00:34:05,035
It's totally set up.

662
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:08,573
All right. Now, get.

663
00:34:16,374 --> 00:34:17,913
Took me a month.

664
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:21,358
I still couldn't hit
that trick the way he did.

665
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,138
Why didn't you
get rid of the tape ?

666
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:25,655
I couldn't, man.

667
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:28,300
That trick was...

668
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:30,293
Too beautiful.

669
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:33,588
Now, where'd Cal
get the tape ?

670
00:34:33,688 --> 00:34:36,728
Cal was Nash's boy.
I just figured he was there.

671
00:34:44,238 --> 00:34:46,283
Some jurassic technology, huh ?

672
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:48,771
Unless you want to spring
to have the tape analyzed.

673
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:50,655
It's not up to me, Lil.

674
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,670
I heard about Doherty.

675
00:34:54,265 --> 00:34:56,423
Just have to do the
job better with less.

676
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,924
................

677
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:13,674
Have a seat, Cal.

678
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:21,673
What ?

679
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:23,038
Well, innocent
guys don't just

680
00:35:23,409 --> 00:35:24,636
take a seat.

681
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:28,007
Deep down, you knew this
day was coming, Cal.

682
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,838
Lost a lot
of years to drugs.

683
00:35:29,873 --> 00:35:30,936
I made no secret of that.

684
00:35:30,971 --> 00:35:33,005
Probably don't remember some
of the stuff you did to score.

685
00:35:33,176 --> 00:35:36,238
Popped for meth twice.
Five months in county,

686
00:35:36,325 --> 00:35:38,603
caught jacking car stereos.

687
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,537
I told you,
those days are behind me.

688
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:42,569
Yeah, but this ain't.

689
00:35:44,172 --> 00:35:46,063
Want to know
what's on there ?

690
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:50,036
Why don't you tell me ?
It's footage

691
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,704
of your best friend's
last night on earth.

692
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:53,803
June 27.

693
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:55,968
Warehouse in Brewerytown.
Remember that ?

694
00:35:56,283 --> 00:35:57,101
No.

695
00:35:57,336 --> 00:35:58,436
Come on, Cal.

696
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:01,210
That night Nash skated that line ?

697
00:36:01,211 --> 00:36:02,611
Tore it up.

698
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:06,476
Epic stuff. I mean, so good you
sold the tape of it to Grady.

699
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:09,074
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wasn't there.

700
00:36:11,164 --> 00:36:12,312
Well, in that case,

701
00:36:12,313 --> 00:36:14,613
you won't mind
if we get a voice read.

702
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:19,142
- For what ?
- Well, need to match

703
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,343
a voice our techs discovered
on the tape.

704
00:36:24,404 --> 00:36:27,304
Say "Nash" into the mic.

705
00:36:33,938 --> 00:36:36,536
We know
you were there that night.

706
00:36:37,085 --> 00:36:38,607
But what we can't figure

707
00:36:38,608 --> 00:36:40,608
is why you'd sell
the tape to Grady.

708
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:42,538
The only way you'd sell out
a friend like that

709
00:36:42,573 --> 00:36:45,534
was if you knew
he wasn't coming back.

710
00:36:49,594 --> 00:36:50,825
Just say your friend's name.

711
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:53,264
I'm not going to do that.
I want to hear you say it !

712
00:36:53,513 --> 00:36:55,641
You were there.
We know you were there.

713
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,501
Maybe I was.

714
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:01,526
Nash tell you he signed
with Grady's sponsor ?

715
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,199
I heard it from
somebody else.

716
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:05,603
But you and him were gonna do
your own thing. Was that it ?

717
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:07,271
- We were a team.
- But he ditched you,

718
00:37:07,306 --> 00:37:08,872
forgot all about your plans.

719
00:37:08,907 --> 00:37:11,905
I didn't have what he had.
Nobody did.

720
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:13,745
He left you
with nothing.

721
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,617
That why you sold this tape
and the trick to Grady ?

722
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,415
The guy you hated ?

723
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:22,100
You could have hit that trick,
made a name for yourself.

724
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,856
No.

725
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,903
- No what, Cal ?
- I couldn't do it !

726
00:37:26,427 --> 00:37:29,050
Not then. Not after.
Not ever.

727
00:37:33,805 --> 00:37:35,840
And he was leaving me behind.

728
00:37:47,954 --> 00:37:50,097
- Been looking for that.
- Come all the way down here

729
00:37:50,097 --> 00:37:52,141
just to make sure
I didn't sell Vonda's camera ?

730
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,453
What are you doing ?

731
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:55,604
What's it look like ?

732
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:57,306
Working on the trick.

733
00:37:57,841 --> 00:37:59,600
Something else you
want to tell me,

734
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,230
like how you signed
with Accelerator ?

735
00:38:06,644 --> 00:38:08,385
I need the money, Cal.

736
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,732
Going to try and get a place,

737
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:12,033
have my brother
move in with me.

738
00:38:12,132 --> 00:38:14,432
Sure. Why not ?
Big-time now.

739
00:38:14,532 --> 00:38:16,699
Ain't like that, man.
I'll be back.

740
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:25,804
- Your foot's too far back.
- Oh, you think ?

741
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,738
- Just try it.
- I've been trying.

742
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:29,102
You tweakin' ?

743
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:31,500
What's that matter to you ?

744
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,531
Maybe if you stopped with the
junk, you'd be able to nail it.

745
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:35,669
Maybe you should stop
giving me advice, bro.

746
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:43,057
I thought we were going
to work on this thing together.

747
00:38:43,392 --> 00:38:46,137
- We can still do the video.
- Not if you're signed with Accelerator.

748
00:38:46,172 --> 00:38:47,971
Get this trick.
I'll show it to them.

749
00:38:48,004 --> 00:38:49,993
I guarantee
they'll sign you.

750
00:38:50,248 --> 00:38:51,507
Yeah, right.

751
00:38:51,864 --> 00:38:52,945
Yeah.

752
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,809
Right.

753
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:06,117
All right. Let's go.
Just get more speed

754
00:39:06,117 --> 00:39:07,586
and keep your foot back.

755
00:39:10,204 --> 00:39:11,771
Keep your foot back.

756
00:39:16,912 --> 00:39:19,137
Again. Do it again.
Come on, Cal.

757
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,171
Hey, you think it's so easy ?
Here. You try it, big shot.

758
00:39:24,206 --> 00:39:26,068
No. It's yours.

759
00:39:28,038 --> 00:39:29,378
I got to think
of something else.

760
00:39:29,413 --> 00:39:31,343
I'm just tired of
busting my head.

761
00:39:32,224 --> 00:39:34,786
- Come on, Cal.
- No. You don't get it.

762
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,162
I can't do it.

763
00:39:37,204 --> 00:39:37,966
All right ?

764
00:39:38,051 --> 00:39:39,487
I can't.

765
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
