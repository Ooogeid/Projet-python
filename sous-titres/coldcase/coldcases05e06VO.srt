00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,700
June 16, 2002

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,500
twelve-- yeah, that's it, baby.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,800
Feelin' it now. Come on.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,600
Ten, king, queen, minus three...

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,900
man, kid over here mumblin' to hisself like mr. Magoo.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,200
He's my half-brother terrance.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,100
He cool, man.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,700
I thought he was homeless.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,200
Man, forget all that, aight?

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,800
Just hit me.

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,200
ah. Bang, you busted.

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,900
Dang, aight...

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,400
hold up.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,100
Yo, t, man, gimme ten.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
Naw, forget it, man. We out.

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,700
Come on, man. We wanna run with the big dogs,
we gotta bring it.

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,800
You bring it, all right.

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,300
You just keep giving it all away.

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,300
Are you watchin' the game?

20
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,400
I was just on a roll.
I just need to get it back.

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,900
Hey, boy, you wanna ante up
or take your half-ass brother on home?

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,700
twenty. Deal me in.

23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,900
What's up with this fool?

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,800
Naw, he just playin'.

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,100
I said deal me in.

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,700
Yo, t, what you doing?

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,100
It's called doublin' down.
Hit me.

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,200
Man, t, you can't double down on no 17. 
You gonna bust.

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,100
Another ten says I beat every hand here.

30
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,100
it's your money, fool.

31
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,200
I thought I said hit me.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,300
twenty-one.

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,300
What you got?

34
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,300
Damn.

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,500
Damn! 

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,700
Man, that was luck.

37
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,500
Nine times out of ten, 
you would've bust on that same hand, chump.

38
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Nine times out of ten,

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,100
but there's 52 cards in the deck,

40
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,400
and you already burnt 11 out of 12 face cards,

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,900
plus all your tens and aces.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,900
Leaving even odds,
I get a four or lower.

43
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,100
And I thank you for that.

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,100
By the way, name's terrance.

45
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,800
How you like my chump change now?

46
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,900
yo, let me see that.

47
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,800
Boss, guy over there says he's the father 
of a terrance carter.

48
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,400
Teenage gunshot victim,

49
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
back in '02.

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,500
He wants to see if he could get 
his son's personal effects "for keepsake."

51
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,300
Five years after the fact?

52
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,000
Claims he hadn't seen the boy since he was a baby.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,300
On the outs with the mother.

54
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Asked if he could get his son's wallet,

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,000
said he "needed" his social security number.

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,100
Scumbag's trying to commit fraud.

57
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,500
Pull the kid's social.

58
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,200
Already on it.

59
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,300
Sir, I'm afraid we can't release any evidence
or personal effects 

60
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,500
until an investigation's been closed. 
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,400
So how's that investigation going?

62
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,800
Five years now, ain't it?

63
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Bullet was never matched to any other case,

64
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,500
registered gun or otherwise.

65
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
So what, 

66
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
case closed?

67
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,300
There were people on that block who know damn well 
who shot your son, mr. Carter.

68
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,800
Unfortunately, 

69
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,100
none are willing to cooperate with the police.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,400
So that's how it is, now, huh?

71
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,600
Just... 

72
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,200
chalk it up to the neighborhood?

73
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,400
Didn't say that.

74
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,600
So what then?

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,500
It's my son's fault he got shot?
That's it?

76
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,200
Sure there's enough blame to go around.

77
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,500
- What?
- Mr. Carter,

78
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,200
if you know anyone,

79
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,500
anyone who might talk to us,

80
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,200
we'd always appreciate any help.

81
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah, right.

82
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,400
Otherwise, y'all just done looking.

83
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,500
Maybe we should look again.

84
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,700
Starting with the rock that slug 
just crawled out from under.

85
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,200
Turns out terrance carter's social security number's 
still in use.

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,600
Used to open three different charge accounts 
since his death.

87
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
So either he's still alive and kicking...

88
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
or somebody already beat dad to the punch.

???

93
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,700
Oh, yeah, sorry, man.

94
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,100
Just got ...

95
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,900
caught up with this thing.

96
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,400
Blonde or brunette?

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,800
I wish.

98
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Some pain-in-the-ass ada.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let me guess:

100
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,100
The redheaded nutcracker 
with the nice set of pins?

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Nah, 

102
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,300
just some dinosaur prepping an old robbery in west.

103
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,500
Original theory on terrance carter?

104
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,600
Kid caught a random bullet on a rooftop 
in north philly five years ago.

105
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,900
Not so random.

106
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,100
Find all kind of spent shells 
up on those rooftops.

107
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,500
Thugs and bangers going up there
to test out their nines, .22s,
you name it.

108
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,800
So some punk taking target practice drops a kid 
with an unlucky stray.

109
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,700
We know why terrance was up there?

110
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,900
Drugs, guns, escape--

111
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,800
could've been just about anything on that block.

112
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,400
That's 29th street turf--

113
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,000
no evidence of gang affiliation?

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Not really, 

115
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
just this.

116
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,100
Looks like a name and number.

117
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,900
"Sam 678-9235"?

118
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,600
Phone number came back to nothing.

119
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,500
No kid named sam,

120
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,700
witness or suspect.

121
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,400
Statement from the kid's mother was 
less than helpful.

122
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,700
Welfare mom, nowhere dad,

123
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,500
kid had no chance.

124
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,400
No witnesses, no leads, 
no big surprise on that block.

125
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,700
Social security number on terrance carter was 
first used to open an account 
shortly after he died.

126
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Peco?

127
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,100
Philadelphia electric.

128
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,700
Same address given for terrance carter.

129
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,600
Residence of the mother, 
cheryl carter.

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,800
So mom just steals her dead kid's social?

131
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,600
Probably figured he wasn't using it.

132
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,300
Parents like that,

133
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,800
who needs enemies?

134
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,800
Nerve of that man.

135
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,300
Trying to come in and collect on terrance.

136
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,700
When it comes to picking the bones of your dead son,

137
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,200
you got gerald beat.

138
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
Excuse me?

139
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,500
Only took you a week after your son's murder 
to steal his social security number.

140
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,400
Funeral wiped me out.

141
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,800
They cut me off,

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,700
turned off all my utilities.

143
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,900
You collected on the victim's comp fund 
for burial expenses.

144
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,100
Barely covered a pine box.

145
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,000
Terrance's father never chipped in?

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,300
Not a dime.

147
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,000
Not worth a damn as a husband 
or a father.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,200
You don't know how tough it was,

149
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
raising that boy on my own.

150
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,500
Terrance get into trouble?

151
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,000
Boy was nothing but a daydreamer.

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,900
Told him...

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,900
if he wasn't gonna go to school,

154
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
he needed to find a way to earn.

155
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,200
How? He was only 14.

156
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,000
I had two jobs 
when I was his age.

157
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,900
And school...

158
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,000
didn't get me nothing but pregnant.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,100
Legal dropout age is 16.

160
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,800
Oh, you gonna lecture me now?

161
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,500
What was terrance doing up on that roof 
when he got shot?

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,500
Told the police,

163
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,500
he'd started hanging out up there 
with michael.

164
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,300
Michael?

165
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,800
His half-brother.

166
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,300
They grew up on the same block.

167
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,000
But michael's mama, 
she didn't raise him right.

168
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,100
Uh-huh.

169
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,300
What were they doing up there?

170
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,400
Playing the fool, skipping school, 

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,500
trying to duck me.

172
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,700
High or low, t?

173
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,900
High. Face card.

174
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,400
 Next.

175
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,600
Low--

176
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,000
two, three or four.

177
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,100
Come on, man.
I got this cold.

178
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,500
 You hear from dad?

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No. You?

180
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,200
My mama got a letter, from inside.

181
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,900
Asked how big I was.

182
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,600
Said he wanted to catch up.

183
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,200
He said that?

184
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,200
Called me his "main man."

185
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
Please.

186
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,500
He just tryin' to get back with my moms.

187
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,900
He ask about me?

188
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,100
 Yeah. 

189
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,100
Yeah, you know... 

190
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,000
forget it.
Don't matter.

191
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,200
What's up with that bird man anyway?

192
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,400
Got all them locks on his birds.

193
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,100
Crazy fool's got twice as many locks 
on the apartment.

194
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,000
Heard he got a safe full of cash, too.

195
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,200
How them birds always know to come back?

196
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,800
Man, forget the birds.

197
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,100
Focus on the deck.

198
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,700
Naw, man. We done practicing.
I got it.

199
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,200
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

200
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,100
No more small-time.

201
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,900
We gonna hustle a man's game,

202
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,500
roll in with a shot caller.

203
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Now, come on.

204
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,900
Finish the deck, T.

205
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,600
Six cards left in the deck.

206
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,600
A deuce, a pair of eights, a jack, 2 ks.

207
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,300
Damn, man.
We about to get rich.

208
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,500
Or die trying.

209
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,500
Terrance was counting cards?

210
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,200
Some stupid corner hustle,

211
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,500
up to no good.

212
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,500
Only way to make money counting cards 
is playing blackjack.

213
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,400
Takes a real computer upstairs
to bring down the house.

214
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Terrance was real good with numbers.

215
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,900
What do you think he meant by
"roll in with a shot caller," hustling some card game?

216
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't know,

217
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,600
but michael was always trying 
to suck my boy into it.

218
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,500
Just like I told the do-nothing police back then.

219
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,700
That kind of attitude makes you friends.

220
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,500
Didn't matter then to y'all,

221
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,800
just like I know it won't now.

222
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,000
Finish up with that head shrink yet?

223
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,200
What? First the boss, now you?

224
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,100
I just want to know if I'm rollin' with a nut job.

225
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,100
One more session,

226
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,600
I'll be certified.

227
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,500
That our guy?

228
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,100
How'd you get the horse, 
michael?

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Grow up in a war zone,
this how you end up.

230
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,600
Another casualty of the neighborhood,

231
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,500
just like your dead half-brother.

232
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
About time y'all cared.

233
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,700
You with terrance the night he got shot?

234
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,600
I was home.

235
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,900
Only took another year 
for a bullet to catch up to me.

236
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,600
Tryin' to tell these kids 
what happens you run on the streets,

237
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,300
don't get your head on straight. 

238
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,700
Terrance's mother seems to think 
you know who shot him.

239
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,300
Y'all need to consider the source.

240
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,700
She never liked me 'cause of my moms.

241
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,000
So what were you doing up
on that roof with terrance,

242
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,500
talking some big card hustle?

243
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,200
We were just looking for an angle to play.

244
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,800
Stake our claim.

245
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
What kind of angle?

246
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,500
Setting a real good example for these kids.

247
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Keeping your mouth shut about your brother's murder?

248
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,900
Five years now.

249
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,600
That's real brave.

250
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,900
And for what? Hmm?

251
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,700
Lot of good it did you.

252
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
There was only one card game that mattered.

253
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,000
But you ain't hear it from me.

254
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,700
An underground card game?

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,700
Where?

256
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,100
Big fat ray'S.

257
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,300
Knew if I could get t in on that game,

258
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,700
we could do some serious damage.

259
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,700
How? You were just a couple of kids.

260
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,300
So how I got the idea 
to set up the meet with delonte.

261
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,500
Knew if we rolled in with him,

262
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
nobody'd mess with us.

263
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,100
Delonte?

264
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,400
King.

265
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,800
Banging thug.

266
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,100
Shot caller in the 29th street crew.

267
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,500
Turned out delonte had other plans for terrance.

268
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,000
no disrespect, yo.

269
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,900
Just got a proposition for your man， here is all.

270
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,000
Huh.

271
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,300
Michael,

272
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
my half-brother terrance.
Ready to go to work.

273
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,300
Don't need no more corner boys 
slinging for me, man.

274
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,000
Talking about big fat ray's game.

275
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,200
You get us in the door,

276
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,700
we can run the table.

277
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,100
Y'all get half our cut.

278
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,700
I'm good with all kinds of numbers.

279
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,100
Like the code on your door there.

280
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,100
Say what?

281
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,700
Punk must have seen me punch in the code
over my shoulder before,

282
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,700
like they do at them atms.

283
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,400
Hold up, chill.

284
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,000
How'd you get that combo, young'un?

285
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,500
That lock? 
Got about 3,000 combinations.

286
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,100
Take ten minutes to crack it cold,

287
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,900
but your man here made it easy.

288
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,800
Say what?

289
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,800
Ten numbers on the keypad.

290
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,100
But there's two to each button,

291
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,700
so it's really just a five-digit pin.

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,700
So?

293
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
So it cuts it in half,

294
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,900
some 1,600 possible numbers.

295
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,800
And since that 29th street ink gave me 
the first two digits, 

296
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,600
I figure there's only a couple hundred left 

297
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,700
now by looking at the keypad I saw the five/six,

298
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,000
seven/eight buttons were worn down by fingerprints.

299
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Which makes sense, it's a 'sixers town.

300
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,800
So 29-76,

301
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,900
got one number left,

302
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,500
figure I got a one in five shot.

303
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,500
Guess I just guessed right.

304
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,300
How'd you get that last number?

305
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,600
what?

306
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,300
Your shirt, fool.

307
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,100
The number.

308
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
All right, young'un.

309
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,400
Know about the safe 

310
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,800
bolted into a floor.

311
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,100
You got to get in and out, quick.

312
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,600
 Keypad lock or combo,

313
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,500
we can get it done in under ten minutes.

314
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,800
Was I talking to you?

315
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,100
Yeah, we could do it.

316
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,300
Let's line it up.

317
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,300
All right.
Next week, then.

318
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,900
But...

319
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,900
you get caught...

320
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,500
try to cross me?

321
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,600
You don't wanna know me.

322
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,300
Delonte used you for break-ins?

323
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,100
Not me.

324
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,400
Just terrance.

325
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
Couple weeks later, t was dead.

326
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,000
You think delonte took him out.

327
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,200
So terrance could never finger him.

328
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,500
My boy t was special, you know. 

329
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,700
It's like a blessing and a curse around here.

330
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
A curse?

331
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,900
Soon as people find out you got something,

332
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,200
they want a piece of you.

333
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,900
Where's this, uh, delonte now?

334
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,600
He upstate on stick-up he did.

335
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,400
Just know, 

336
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,100
boy like that don't snitch.

337
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,700
And he ain't afraid of doin' no time either.

338
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,600
Even the devil makes deals.

339
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Maybe...

340
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,000
but he always get his in the end.

341
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,400
So, 

342
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,200
off the painkillers yet?

343
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,700
Been off.

344
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,200
Wound's almost healed up.

345
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,500
You haven't been sleeping much.

346
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,200
That obvious, huh?

347
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,100
Any nightmares?

348
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,300
Last session.

349
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,800
Might as well go out with a bang, right?

350
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,300
So to speak.

351
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,500
Um...

352
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,400
the other night... yeah.

353
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,800
???

354
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,400
They were wheeling me into the er,

355
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,900
lights everywhere,

356
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,000
voices.

357
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,200
How'd you feel?

358
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,600
How did I feel?

359
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,700
Um...

360
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,100
scared, 

361
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,300
I guess.

362
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,700
They were badgering me,

363
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,400
asking me questions.

364
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,200
Questions like what?

365
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,700
I-I can't remember.

366
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,200
Try.

367
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,500
"Is there anyone to call?"

368
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,900
"Who do you want us to call?"

369
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,400
Something like that.

370
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,700
Was there?

371
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,600
Was there what?

372
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,900
Anyone to call, lilly?

373
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,700
When you're in a situation like that,

374
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,800
you ask yourself these things, 

375
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,000
take inventory of your life.

376
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,800
What you've done,

377
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,100
whom you've loved.

378
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,300
That's what your nightmare's telling you.

379
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,900
That photo's gotta be what, 15 years old?

380
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,900
Your daughter,

381
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,900
jessica, she's 

382
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,500
not a little girl anymore, is she?

383
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,400
You didn't answer the question.

384
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,900
No prom, 

385
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,500
graduation,
wedding photos...

386
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,000
just wonder why.

387
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,400
You two still even talk anymore?

388
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,200
Maybe not.

389
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,700
That's why you fix other people's problems.

390
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,300
'Cause you can't fix your own?

391
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,400
That's impressive.

392
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,500
Too bad you can't see yourself the way you see me.

393
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,800
Oh, I, uh... 

394
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
my time's up.

395
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,100
The nightmares won't end, lilly.

396
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,100
Until you can do that.

397
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,700
Sit down.

398
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,300
Remember him, delonte?

399
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,900
Another dead clocker off the block?

400
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,800
Terrance carter, five years back. 
Wasn't a clocker,

401
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,600
but he sure was good with numbers.

402
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,300
Kid you thought might be good 
at cracking combinations.

403
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
That code scribbled on his hand 
mean something to you?

404
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,900
I can't help you.

405
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,500
You used him for break-ins.

406
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,000
Did I now?

407
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,200
Who told you that?

408
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,500
No sweat off your back,

409
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,800
take terrance out of the picture after a job.

410
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,000
Leaving no one to flip on you.

411
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,000
Sorry, fellas.

412
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,400
We done playin' footsie?

413
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,800
Co says you're the alpha dog 
on this cell block.

414
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,700
Makes sense,

415
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,600
with half your crew locked up in here.

416
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,700
I get anything I want on the inside.

417
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,500
Really?

418
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,100
Don'tsee nothing about conjugal visitation.

419
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,700
Don't nobody get that.

420
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,800
See my baby mama through the glass 

421
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,900
once a month.

422
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,000
Saying we might be able to pull some string
you play this right.

423
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,300
So pull.

424
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,800
Give us something about the break-ins,

425
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,100
and maybe you get to put your jack in a box.

426
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,000
Glaze that ham with some real honey.

427
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,300
I used that punk once 
for a break-in,

428
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,400
but it didn't work out.

429
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,500
All the more reason to fear him snitching.

430
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,600
Please.

431
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,400
Kid was all brains ...

432
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,800
and no balls.

433
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,100
You ask me, 

434
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,000
wasn't no pot shot took him out, either.

435
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,300
Check in there for the safe.

436
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,100
Go, go.

437
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,000
what you doing?

438
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Where's the safe?

439
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,800
who's there?

440
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,900
What the hell?

441
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,300
???

442
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
you hit the bird man's apartment.

443
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,700
Crazy ol' coot came home blasting.

444
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,100
Was terrance hit?

445
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,200
No, 

446
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,000
just wet his pants.

447
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,700
Didn't grab nothing 
but some stupid notebook.

448
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,700
But the bird man got a good look at his face.

449
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,600
So?

450
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,800
So, kid got shot up on that roof, right?

451
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,600
You're saying it's the bird man?

452
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,200
He always up there.

453
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,100
Figured he caught up to the little man one day.

454
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,800
Took him out.

455
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,400
Had an uncle 
used to race birds.

456
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,600
He's kinda plump for a homing pigeon.

457
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,400
Oscar's a rock pigeon. 

458
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,700
Fell out a nest into the gutter
when he was a baby.

459
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,300
Nursed him back to health.

460
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,800
I need to talk to you about a break-in, augustine.

461
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,800
Your apartment.

462
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,700
Few years back.

463
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,600
Shots fired.

464
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,700
Remember that?

465
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Some punks broke into my place.

466
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,000
Had to protect myself.

467
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,100
Only you never reported it.

468
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,700
911's a joke on this block.

469
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,600
Boys got what was coming to 'em.

470
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Unfortunately, one of 'em got shot.

471
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Right up here on the roof of this building.

472
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
14-year-old terrance carter.

473
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,700
Bullet from a nine.

474
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
We check your apartment,
we gonna find that weapon?

475
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Search away.

476
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,300
I didn't kill that boy.

477
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
The code 

478
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,600
written on his hand...

479
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,200
mean anything to you?

480
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,500
Nope.

481
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,600
But he didn't talk much about his personal life.

482
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,200
You talked to terrance?

483
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,000
When?

484
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,600
Right up here on this roof.

485
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Under much different circumstances.

486
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,800
Sick of you damn kids...

487
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,100
- wait, wait, wait.
- Trying to steal from me again?

488
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,800
I was just trying to bring back 
what belonged to you.

489
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,500
Who did this?

490
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,100
I was just messin' around.

491
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,400
I didn't mean to screw it up.

492
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,300
How'd you do this?

493
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,900
When?

494
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,500
Don't know. Just ...

495
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
get caught up in stuff,

496
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,600
lose track of time.

497
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,000
Sorry.

498
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,900
So that model airplane in your apartment--

499
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,100
that some kind of hobby?

500
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,700
Some kind of career.

501
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,100
You make planes with numbers?

502
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,300
It's called design.

503
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,700
It's all about numbers.

504
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,500
How you learn about all that stuff?

505
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,300
Planes, birds, 

506
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,100
flying.

507
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,900
Try the public library.

508
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,200
Sounds boring.

509
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,500
the more I know about flight,

510
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,800
the less I know.

511
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,200
Gotta have a passion for it.

512
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,100
But you wouldn't know anything about that.

513
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Why's that?

514
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,400
It would require you to use your brain

515
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,300
for something other than 
trying to rip people off.

516
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,200
That one bird in the red cage...

517
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,000
how come he don't ever get out?

518
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,600
Lost his will to fly.

519
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,200
It's a bird, ain't it?

520
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,000
So you're not only a thief,

521
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
you're a know-it-all pain-in-the-ass, too?

522
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
'Sup, t?

523
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,600
Let's go.

524
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,600
Race 'em.

525
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,200
Every thursday from the basketball courts.

526
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Race what?

527
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,500
The babies.

528
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,900
Flight training.

529
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,800
You'd probably think it was boring.

530
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,300
Kid was special.

531
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,400
Raw mathematical ability,
off the charts.

532
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,100
He show up for the races?

533
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,300
And the math and flight lessons.

534
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,000
Tried to challenge him, 

535
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,700
show him there's a world outside this block.

536
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,500
Till the inevitable happened.

537
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,700
What's that?

538
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,100
Some con showed up in his life.

539
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,500
Some con?

540
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,500
Claimed he was his father.

541
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,300
Gerald carter?

542
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,500
Came to see his son?

543
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,200
All I know is,

544
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,000
few days after dad shows up,

545
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,100
I wake up to feed my birds,

546
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,100
and they'd found that boy's body.

547
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,800
Right over there.

548
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:52,700
Have you heard about miralax?

549
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,800
Got a real selective memory, gerald.

550
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,300
Coming in here with that tale-of-woe bs 
about not getting to see your son.

551
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,700
Look, I came back around,
but my ex didn't know.

552
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,700
Court said I owed child support, alimony,

553
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,900
all that nonsense.

554
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,000
Nonsense?

555
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,000
See? 

556
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,300
I knew the boy's mom would flip out
she knew I contacted him.

557
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,000
So, why lie to us, 

558
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,900
unless you had something else to hide?

559
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,500
Me and the law, 
on a need-to-know basis. 

560
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,300
Ain't about to change now.

561
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,300
So, you hadn't seen your son in years.

562
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,400
All of sudden, you pop up in his life.

563
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Couple days later,

564
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
he's dead.

565
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,800
Bad coincidence.

566
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,900
Even worse, you split again.

567
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,100
Didn't even stick around to bury him.

568
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,500
maybe I wasn't the best father...

569
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,000
...but terrance was my blood.

570
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,700
Came back 'cause I had to give it another try.

571
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,100
Four basic forces of physics at work in flight.

572
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,500
Lift versus gravity;

573
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,100
thrust versus drag,

574
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,400
bernoulli's principle...

575
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
if you say so, boss.

576
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,300
I didn't say so.
It's a fact.

577
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,500
Flight is a delicate balance
of math and physics.

578
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,700
The larger the wing...

579
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
the greater the lift.

580
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,800
Wing aspect ratio.

581
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,500
got that.

582
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,100
Really?

583
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,100
where'd you get that?

584
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,500
Public library.

585
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,200
that the formula you used 
to design that plane in your apartment?

586
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,400
I used to be an engineer.

587
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,200
Big firm. Long time ago.

588
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,900
How you end up back here?

589
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,000
well, I wanted to rethink the way we design planes,

590
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,100
but they didn't,

591
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,400
so I left.

592
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,900
Rethink?

593
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,600
Birds have flexible wings.

594
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,000
Took us thousands of years to approximate 
what they just come by naturally.

595
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,300
Go ahead.

596
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,300
Let her rip.

597
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,600
For real?

598
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Go on. 

599
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,300
It's what they're born to do.

600
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,600
there are things which seem incredible 
to most men who've never studied mathematics.

601
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,000
Never thought about birds like that.

602
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,700
"We're all in the gutter,

603
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,500
but some of us are looking at the stars."

604
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,700
Who said that?

605
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,500
Oscar wilde.

606
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,700
Oscar, huh?

607
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,300
Terrence.

608
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,300
dad?

609
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,200
Michael told me i might find you here.

610
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,400
Didn't mention how big you went and got.

611
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,400
I was hoping we could talk a bit.

612
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Maybe catch me up on some things, son.

613
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,400
Keep your eye on the stars, kid.

614
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,500
Come on, baby,

615
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,600
So, baby, you be good.

616
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,600
???

617
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,900
that bird man wasn't his father.

618
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,000
I was.

619
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,400
You had a problem with augustine.

620
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,800
Grown man hanging out with my boy, acting white?

621
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,100
couldn't figure out his angle.

622
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,800
That's no surprise.

623
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,300
You're not that bright.

624
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,700
But your son-- he was special.

625
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,700
Least one of 'em anyway.

626
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,700
So that was your angle.

627
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,100
You figured out what terrance could do

628
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,800
Michael told you he could count cards.

629
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,000
Never heard nothing about that.

630
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Just glad we got to spend some time together.

631
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,000
A couple days later, he winds up dead.

632
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,900
Yeah, 

633
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,700
you're father of the year.

634
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,600
Don't need to justify nothing to y'all.

635
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,400
He was my son.

636
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,400
You're nothing but a lowlife con.

637
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,800
I grew up around shiftless fools like you,

638
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,000
expect something for nothing.

639
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,900
Who you think you are, man?

640
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,500
I'm the guy who goes around 
cleaning up all your mess.

641
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,400
Screwed up families and sons 
you don't even deserve.

642
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
At least my boy understood.

643
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,900
Never forget your people,

644
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,600
where you came from.

645
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,200
What's that supposed to mean?

646
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,100
I wouldn't expect a couple of black cops 
to understand that.

647
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,200
go ahead. Take a swing.

648
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,600
I could use the money.

649
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,800
Just a matter of time 
before we sort this out, gerald.

650
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
terrance went to the library, right?

651
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,800
The number written on his hand.

652
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,000
Could be some sort of reference number.

653
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,600
What, like a book?

654
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,600
I'm not sure if it's dewey decimal,
but ...

655
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,300
it could be a date.

656
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,100
"Six, seven, 89.

657
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,000
Sam."

658
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,700
I'm thinking ...

659
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,000
newspaper, magazine,
some sort of periodical?

660
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
23-five.

661
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,900
Page number?

662
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,500
Terrance looked something up,

663
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
but he wasn't writing any book reports.

664
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,800
Well, it's worth a shot.

665
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,700
Hit the library, dewey.

666
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,200
S-a-m--

667
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,500
 san antonio mercury news.

668
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,800
 That's got to be it, right?

669
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,300
Your call, bro.

670
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,400
Okay, june, '89.

671
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
oh.

672
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,000
that's the reason ...
I did not make it through college.

673
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,100
Yeah, 

674
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,600
college blows, dude.

675
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,100
June 7, 1989, page 23.

676
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,100
Plane crash outside of dallas.

677
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:3
