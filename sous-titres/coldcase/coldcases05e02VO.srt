00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,500
the following story is fictional and does 
not depict any actual person or event

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,500
 now.school policy
allowed me to do so,

3
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:15,973
I would tell you
how these methods

4
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:18,086
of birth control can be used,
and what they do.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,780
But I cannot.

6
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:22,090
I will be fired, so...

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,233
Oh, ain't no thing,
Miss Danbury.

8
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:25,497
Carrie Swett
can tell us.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,267
Ha.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,300
But can't you

11
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:30,816
teach us about
abstinence?

12
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:32,005
That's legal,
right?

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,199
Oh, what do you need
to know

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,391
about it, Quinn?
You live it.

15
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,333
If you refrain from
sexual intercourse,

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,100
a practice known
as abstinence,

17
00:00:39,107 --> 00:00:40,374
you will not
get pregnant.

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,724
And if you feel
you can't abstain,

19
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,600
well, let me give you a hint.

20
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,523
These items
on this sheet here might help.

21
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:48,914
Yeah, Miss Danbury.

22
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,424
Is it true that
oral copulation

23
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,890
isn't sex?

24
00:00:53,084 --> 00:00:54,485
That is so not true.

25
00:00:54,817 --> 00:00:56,753
And President Clinton
is a liar.

26
00:00:57,584 --> 00:00:59,668
It's not
technically.

27
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,666
Yes, I'd like to hear
from an expert.

28
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:03,663
Shut up!
Jerry!

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,033
Okay, well, it's a form
of sexual activity,

30
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,766
yes. Whether or not

31
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:09,106
you consider
it as...

32
00:01:09,172 --> 00:01:11,283
You know what?
I can't talk to you about this.

33
00:01:11,457 --> 00:01:13,256
But it's current
events! Come on.

34
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:15,822
You can't get pregnant
from oral sex, but

35
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:17,662
you can get STDs, so please

36
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:19,465
be careful.
Please.

37
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:21,214
Or you'll end up
like Carrie Swett.

38
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:22,159
Jerry Wood,

39
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:22,905
out!

40
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,204
Now!

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,037
Saved!

42
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:32,922
Kidding, Swett.

45
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:15,327
I did not have sexual relations
with that woman,

46
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,325
Miss Lewinsky.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,963
I never told anybody to lie.

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,632
Not a single time, never.

49
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:24,885
These allegations are false,

50
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:28,217
and I need to go back
to work for the American people.

51
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,192
Thank you.

52
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:35,606
You got here fast.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,634
You, too.

54
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,250
We've been up
all night.

55
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,188
What's your excuse?

56
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,909
Uh, late night
with friends.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,533
You?

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,344
What?

59
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:47,460
I got a life.

60
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,200
Yeah, right.

61
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,503
You see Gordon at the
office this morning?

62
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,810
IAD guy? Thought he was done.

63
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:54,580
Wants Scotty for round two.

64
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:56,414
What's the deal with the van?

65
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,000
Abandoned.

66
00:02:58,257 --> 00:02:59,343
Junkies been using it.

67
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,294
Southeast does a search
for narcotics,

68
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,387
this turns up in the wheel well.

69
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:05,338
Belonged to

70
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:05,964
Carrie Swett.

71
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,700
15-year-old girl,

72
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,643
assaulted and left for dead

73
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:13,000
in Fairmount Park back in '98.

74
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:15,400
Found partially nude.
Blunt force trauma

75
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:16,093
to the head.

76
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,030
That area-- kids
get busy there.

77
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,799
Not that I remember.

78
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,202
That was a theory.

79
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,887
Lovers Lane
turned ugly.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,086
Oh, Carrie had herself
some boyfriends.

81
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,734
Oh, that kind of 15.

82
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:29,553
Hmm. So, who owns the van?

83
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,513
Last and only
registered owner

84
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:33,099
is a Walter Peranski.

85
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:34,730
Custodian
at Carrie's high school.

86
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:37,700
Wow. So, Carrie was pretty much
open for business.

87
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:40,372
Job gives this guy opportunity.

88
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:42,964
Maybe her reputation
gives motive.

89
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:46,371
Think a janitor would know
how to clean up after himself.

91
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:24,782
Carrie Swett, 15,
beat to death in Fairmount Park.

92
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,022
Only child.

93
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,334
Dad's in Ohio,
out of the picture.

94
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:29,073
Mother, Sheila,

95
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,314
tends bar at a
dive in Kensington.

96
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,299
Says Carrie

97
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,485
went out for a soda,
7:00 p.m. May 17.

98
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:35,934
Didn't come back.

99
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:37,373
No murder weapon
at the site.

100
00:04:37,374 --> 00:04:39,687
ME says skull fractures
are irregular,

101
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,934
caused by a heavy rock.

102
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,145
Carrie's shirt's off,

103
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:45,846
but no signs
of a sex crime.

104
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:49,394
Doer couldn't close the deal,
gets embarrassed, lashes out?

105
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,201
Could be

106
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,214
Carrie rebuffed him.

107
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,430
Well, CSU flagged
her footprints.

108
00:04:56,807 --> 00:04:58,987
Oh, she fought, tried to run.

109
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:01,550
Yeah, looks
like it.

110
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:03,983
Carrie's wearing a ring
on her wedding finger.

111
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:07,837
Engraved with the name Timothy

112
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:08,707
and a heart.

113
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:11,010
Who's Timothy?
Never found him.

114
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:12,157
Guys they interviewed

115
00:05:12,164 --> 00:05:14,596
in '98 laughed at the idea
of buying her a ring.

116
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:15,897
They said,"I didn't

117
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,421
take a dime to get
her ready to go."

118
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:18,833
Nice.

119
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:21,725
Someone did care about Carrie
enough to buy her this ring.

120
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:26,132
Maybe. But then,
where's he been all these years?

121
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,259
Boss? You got a sec?

122
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:38,992
I made an appointment
with the shrink.

123
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:40,502
Good.

124
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:41,960
Know you
weren't happy,

125
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:44,205
me not keepin'
it together.

126
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:46,525
Well, it's required.

127
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,635
You're mad I went
in the room with him.

128
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:53,530
Ed.

129
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,521
I shouldn't have let it happen.

130
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:56,881
You were shot.

131
00:05:57,545 --> 00:05:58,608
Nothing you could have done.

132
00:05:58,745 --> 00:06:00,285
It was my house, my guys.

133
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:01,811
It wasn't your fault.

134
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:05,880
It shouldn't have been you, Lil.

135
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:09,188
Let me know when you're
done your counseling.

136
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,000
I swear to God,
this is a mistake.

137
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:21,980
Sit down,
Wally.

138
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,050
I-I never done anything illegal.

139
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,099
What about ditchin' your van?ou
It-it broke down.

140
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,906
I didn't want
to pay for a tow.

141
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,300
Listen, what happened

142
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:33,735
to that girl
is a terrible thing,

143
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:35,194
but it wasn't me!

144
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,567
You know about
Carrie Swett's reputation?

145
00:06:38,444 --> 00:06:40,514
Girl like that puts
it on the glass.

146
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,235
She's asking for it.

147
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:44,560
She had very low self-respect,
I thought.

148
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:46,338
Yeah. She gave it out
to everybody, huh?

149
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,000
Why not you, right, Wally?

150
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:51,040
She was a kid.

151
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,850
Don't be perverted.

152
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,025
How did Carrie Swett's

153
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:57,800
shirt wind up hidden
in your van, huh?

154
00:06:57,807 --> 00:06:59,655
Somebody put it in there.

155
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,440
We look like idiots

156
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:01,074
to you?

157
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:02,674
No.

158
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,071
Maybe...

159
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:08,150
Hmm? Maybe...?
The baseball team,the captain.

160
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,900
I used to let him go in there
with girls, you know.

161
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,376
Frisky business
during the lunch hour.

162
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,000
Slow down.

163
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:13,021
And this one time...

164
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:13,753
Take a breath.

165
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,312
I saw him with Carrie Swett.

166
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,932
One time, I saw him go
into my van with her!

167
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,600
Who was this guy?
He was captain

168
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,404
of the baseball team
back in '98.

169
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,835
Uh... Uh, Jerry Wood.

170
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:25,771
Jerry Wood.

171
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:28,841
And you let himfor gettin' busy?
I didn't think

172
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:30,124
he was killin' anybody!

173
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:32,090
Look, you got to believe me.

174
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:34,130
No. I-I thought
it was heavy petting.

175
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:35,547
That's what I thought.

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,601
We'll look

177
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:38,292
into the guy, Wally.

178
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:40,228
Just don't go thinking

179
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,331
your ass is in the clear.

180
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:42,678
I won't.

181
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,877
You used to get busy with Carrie
Swett back in high school?

182
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:53,517
Yeah. Why?

183
00:07:54,364 --> 00:07:55,713
We're looking
into a theory.

184
00:07:56,354 --> 00:07:57,278
Been talking
to some guys.

185
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,581
And there were
a lot of guys.

186
00:07:59,635 --> 00:08:00,577
Hmm?

187
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:02,307
Yeah. True.

188
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:03,900
We heard she liked it rough.

189
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:06,350
You know, maybe one of
these guys is trying

190
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,480
to give Carrie
what she wants

191
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,045
accidentallydeoes too fars 
could happen.

192
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:11,567
So, how was she,

193
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:13,269
when you two were hitting it,
kinky?

194
00:08:13,824 --> 00:08:15,080
She was pretty boring, actually.

195
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,714
Lots of kissy-kissy, blah, blah.

196
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,857
I tried to mix it up once.

197
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:22,046
yeah?

198
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:22,780
How did that go?

199
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:24,834
About the fourth time
we had done it,

200
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,250
brought her to this van
in the parking lot.

201
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:30,434
We found her shirt
in that van.

202
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:32,887
And when Carrie's
dead body was found,

203
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,800
no shirt.

204
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,042
You get how that's adding up?

205
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:36,824
Whoa.

206
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,996
I didn't kill her.

207
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:39,400
Whatappened
in the van?

208
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,588
It was just a prank.

209
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:48,503
I shouldn't
even be here

210
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:49,867
after what you said
in health class

211
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:51,471
I'm sorry. Don't be mad.

212
00:08:55,045 --> 00:08:57,555
If you like me, why
can't you be nice to me?

213
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,471
'Cause I'm complicated.

214
00:09:01,238 --> 00:09:02,178
Me, too.

215
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:06,353
So, why isn't your shirt off,
pretty girl?

216
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:13,099
Do you care about me at all?

217
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,901
I do. I think you're really
different from other girls.

218
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,503
In a good way?

219
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:19,701
In a beautif way

220
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:38,450
In a beautif way
What was that?

221
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,385
Is that a leopard print bra?
Oh.

222
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,242
We were just kidding! Wait!

223
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,873
She runs away
like a freakin' track star,

224
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,731
so I ditched the shirt.

225
00:10:04,556 --> 00:10:05,848
Romantic guy like you--

226
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,816
you ever call the girl again,
take her

227
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:08,405
into the woods?

228
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,636
The ghThshe ,
I had an away game.

229
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,137
You're a Grade D slice
of jackass, Jer.

230
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:16,307
Better hope
your alibi holds up.

231
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,170
S
The shirt we found had
Carrie's name in it.

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,686
She used to do that, so
I wouldn't borrow her clothes.

233
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,979
Didn't stop me.

234
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:32,991
You see this picture?

235
00:10:36,446 --> 00:10:37,640
Hmm.

236
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:38,790
Pretty girl.

237
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:40,389
Real open-hearted.

238
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:44,603
Sheila, you know
if Carrie was hanging out

239
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:46,146
with anybody
from the baseball team?

240
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,960
Here we go. Carrie and  the boys

241
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,107
She was a pretty girl.

242
00:10:53,124 --> 00:10:54,650
People paid attention.

243
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:56,277
But if you're implying
that what happened to her

244
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,813
in those woods was her fault.

245
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,966
That's not what we're saying.

246
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,416
We just want to know
who she was spending time with.

247
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:02,533
Like I told you guys

248
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:04,445
all along, she was a teenager.

249
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:07,428
She didn't exactly share
the details with her ma.

250
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,898
But I knew something was up.

251
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:12,358
Meaning what?

252
00:11:14,435 --> 00:11:17,578
S
Someone, something
was making her change.

253
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:24,719
I need new clothes.

254
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,187
I'm sick of people
looking at me

255
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,630
all the time.
They look

256
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:29,743
'cause you're adorable.
Not adorable.

257
00:11:30,654 --> 00:11:31,664
S
Sexy.

258
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,216
I'm not the kind of girl
you marry.

259
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:36,691
First off, you're way
too young for marriage--

260
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,629
That's not
what I'm saying.

261
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,533
Mom, don't you get sick
of guys whistling at you

262
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,770
and looking
at your chest?

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You got a woman's body.

264
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:44,170
I don't want it.

265
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,100
Look,

266
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:46,511
just ignore the boys.

267
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,103
And don't let anyone treat you

268
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:49,263
how you don't like.

269
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:51,277
There's Tina.
I gotta go.

270
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,677
Uh, just exactly
what are you guys

271
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:53,744
doing here on
a Saturday?

272
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:54,745
Mom, it'Sthing.

273
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:55,992
We just want to hang out

274
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,067
and I don't haveo tell you

275
00:11:57,073 --> 00:11:58,240
everything!
Sheesh.

276
00:11:58,307 --> 00:12:00,496
I didn't know it was
an FBI secret.

277
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:04,433
I love you, Care-bear!

278
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,347
It kills me that she didn't know
how special she was.

279
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:21,393
Hmm.
So,

280
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,764
Carrie was going to school
on a Saturday.

281
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:28,230
T1
Who was this Tina?

282
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:30,577
Never brought her around.

283
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,046
I don't kno'

284
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,588
Girls were never very nice
to Carrie.

285
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,500
Yeah.

286
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:40,876
Thanks, Sheila.

287
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,228
Every year on
her birthday,

288
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,109
I light candles
and make a wish.

289
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,231
Maybe this year,

290
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,684
you guys'll find
who did it,

291
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,030
and my wish
will come true.

292
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,633
Found her.

293
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,337
Friend Carrie's mom described.

294
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,064
Tina Quinn.

295
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:19,463
Oh, there's your

296
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,665
Timothy.
The guy from Carrie's ring?

297
00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:22,740
He's in the picture?

298
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:24,876
Book from the Bible.

299
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,800
Timothy.

300
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,000
"Flee also youthful lusts;

301
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,201
"but follow
righteousness,

302
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:30,268
"faith, charity,peace,

303
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,167
"with them that call
on the Lord

304
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:33,578
out of a pure heart."

305
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:36,424
Hearts Wait Club.

306
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,150
Tina's
the president.

307
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,825
What's that about?

308
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:40,800
Fleeing

309
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,146
youthful lusts,
apparently.

310
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,880
It's a purity ring.

311
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:45,240
Carrie's ring.

312
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,564
Purity, like...

313
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,330
Like, till I'm married,

314
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,382
this finger belongs to God,
and so does my virginity.

315
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:53,144
Veronica's babysitter
has one.

316
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:56,533
Doesn't stop her from getting
busy on my couch, though.

317
00:13:57,323 --> 00:14:00,000
So, Carrie Swett was meeting
this Tina on Saturdays

318
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:01,730
to go to the chastity club.

319
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:04,522
School prude's trying
to reform the tramp.

320
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,945
Guess there was a guy
in Carrie's life after all.

321
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:09,863
???????????????

322
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,700
I've been talking to everyone.

323
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:18,546
ecing together a
complete picture

324
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:19,846
of the hostage
situation

325
00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:20,816
on May 12th.

326
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:22,100
Right.

327
00:14:23,636 --> 00:14:25,145
Which is what we did last time.

328
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:28,003
So,

329
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,170
you fired your weapon, uh,

330
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,900
let's see--

331
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,647
three times intending
to take out Ed Ruzio.

332
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,196
Oh, I did take him out.

333
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,243
When you fired
your weapon,

334
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,205
what was your
line of sight?

335
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,490
I already told you.

336
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:50,833
I was on the blind side
of a two-way mirror.

337
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,333
Rush and I had a verbal cue.

338
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,595
She could see me,
so that's how I got him.

339
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,944
What was the
verbal cue?

340
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,607
It was "Hey."

341
00:14:58,444 --> 00:14:59,010
"Hey?"

342
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:04,154
And when did you establish
this verbal cue?

343
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,433
It was, uh, that morning.

344
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,770
In her apartment.

345
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:12,000
What were you doing

346
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:13,040
in your partners
apartment?

347
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,523
In the morning?

348
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:16,167
Her mother died.

349
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:18,100
I was checking in on her.

350
00:15:18,104 --> 00:15:20,131
I had time saved up,
don't worry.

351
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,298
Does your Lieutenant know

352
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,766
that you violated the perimeter
established by SWAT

353
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,773
when you came upstairs
the evening

354
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,282
of May 12th?
Yeah.

355
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,485
You do disobey orders often,
Detective Valens?

356
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,367
What are you talking about?
You know, like

357
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,500
when you told Mitch Hathtcay
that his son was molested

358
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,866
and murdered by
Cliff Burrell.

359
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,703
Who told you that?

360
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,300
You sent a murderer
on a vigilante mission

361
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,177
th  early ended in a man
getting thrown off a roof.

362
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,200
S
Is that in my record?

363
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:47,040
Oh, I can't tell you that.

364
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,575
Only supervisors have access
to personnel files.

365
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,326
Have you ever had counseling
for your anger problem?

366
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,516
Screw you.

367
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,500
Go find out

368
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:02,085
who stole the quarters
from the piggy bank.

369
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,730
Carrie Swett.

370
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,789
I think about that all the time.

371
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,505
So tragic.

372
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,616
She was a member
of your virginity club?

373
00:16:30,617 --> 00:16:32,783
Hearts Wait Club.

374
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,317
She came to a few
meetings, sure.

375
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:36,314
How's a girl

376
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:38,374
like Carrie wind up
at your club

377
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:41,305
I asked her in the hall one day.

378
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:43,972
You didn't have to have
your V-card.

379
00:16:44,248 --> 00:16:45,200
That like

380
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,069
Amex?

381
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,120
You could

382
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:48,349
revirginize.

383
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:49,503
Take a vow

384
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,993
and erase the past.

385
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,300
Carrie was really into that.

386
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,800
I can't imagine how hard it is

387
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:57,726
to be a girl right now.

388
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:01,650
???????????????

389
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:04,781
and you see singers and
actresses giving it up for free.

390
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,146
How about us?
Trying to stay strong

391
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,686
when even the President can't.

392
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:10,711
And that's why
we're here.

393
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,661
Because it's easier,

394
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:14,250
I think,

395
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,190
to make a commitment
and stay strong

396
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,881
with other people by your side.

397
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,754
Definitely. Like a diet.

398
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:23,794
Nathan, I don't
know why anyone

399
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,854
isn't talking about
"that woman," Monica Lewinsky.

400
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,967
My father was seduced
by a girl like that,

401
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:31,241
who knew hT1s married.

402
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,167
Why would someone do that?

403
00:17:35,124 --> 00:17:35,888
I know why.

404
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,303
You're lonely..

405
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,723
You want affection.

406
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,400
And you think that after,

407
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:44,458
it'll be
different.

408
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:46,467
They'll like you.

409
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:47,828
And do they?

410
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:51,605
No.

411
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,985
And usually you don't even like
yourself.

412
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,560
God sees you,esand He doesn'

413
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:09,730
S
He forgis the things
that you regret.

414
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,823
diI y.di

415
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,250
I want You can.ver.T1

416
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,450
???????????

417
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,713
Nathan 

418
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:35,143
Nathan O'Doell.

419
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:37,480
 w You

420
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:38,255
We loved him.

421
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,025
He was only 22, but we thought
he was very grown up.

422
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,267
HeS

423
00:18:44,272 --> 00:18:45,073
Yeah.

424
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:47,464
You went to his office,
took your puty oath.

425
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:49,253
After hours?

426
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:52,452
It was you, Nathan and God.

427
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,358
It wasn't weird.

428
00:18:57,543 --> 00:19:00,304
No, nothing weird about that.

429
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,848
Nathan O'Donnell?

430
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,668
Philly PD.

431
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,946
Got a few questions
we'd like to ask.

432
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:29,003
Sure.

433
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:30,735
Carrie Swett.

434
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,079
Oh.

435
00:19:34,316 --> 00:19:35,717
I rememberer, of course.

436
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:37,116
Why don't you come
downtown with us,

437
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:38,217
take us down
Memory Lane?

438
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:39,555
Wait, I, um...

439
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:43,194
She attended a handful of Hearts Wait
Club meetings,

440
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:45,248
but I didn't,
I didn't really know her.

441
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:47,096
So, just a coincidence
you left the school a month

442
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,286
after Carrie was murdered?

443
00:19:48,546 --> 00:19:49,595
No, actually.

444
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:52,490
It was rattling.

445
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,003
Made me ly search

446
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:55,879
ers.

447
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:58,471
come on,let's go

448
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:04,550
too'st,I remember the thing changed in the groop

449
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:06,235
just before she was killed

450
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,532
Changed how?

451
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,599
I-I don't know

452
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,700
if this means anything, but, um,
that last meeting,

453
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,500
the mood was weird,
and Carrie was different.

454
00:20:16,704 --> 00:20:17,566
What do you mean?

455
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,204
I used to
have them

456
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:19,304
share secrets.

457
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:20,840
It was a trust exercise.

458
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:22,200
But, uh,

459
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,125
Carrie stopped trusting us.

460
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,071
Sometimes  like
I don't work out enough.

461
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,405
And I'm gross.

462
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,919
Okay.

463
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,150
I think my parents
are mad

464
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,578
I don't do more
extracurriculars.

465
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:42,253
Um... I don't know.

466
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:45,338
I guess I feel like
nobody knows me truly.

467
00:20:47,437 --> 00:20:48,340
Sometimes

468
00:20:48,771 --> 00:20:50,300
I feel so overwhelmed
with life,

469
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,036
I want to go sleep
and never wake up.

470
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,388
Those are your deep,
dark secrets?

471
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,230
i thought this club was about trust
and being  your true self.

472
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,660
Why aren't you guys
being real?

473
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,833
What about when you have
something in your mind

474
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,126
nd
at you can't share?

475
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,299
God

476
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,930
can lift that weight
off your shoulders.

477
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,825
Write down something

478
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,717
that only God can hear.

479
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,685
are you sure no one's
gonn

480
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:33,484
I 'sure.

481
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:38,711
Noheyou' don't
i'll see you next week

482
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:12,827
Oh, my God.

483
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:16,441
No.

484
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,585
Carrie?

485
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,566
She read that thing,
turned pale as a ghost.

486
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,317
You're saying

487
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,496
she read one of these
kids' secrets.

488
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,400
You still got
that can?

489
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:31,342
?
No, it was, it was years ago.
I threw it away.

490
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,355
Didn't want to see

491
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:32,926
what Carrie read?

492
00:22:34,243 --> 00:22:35,140
No, I...

493
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,786
I guess I was thinking,

494
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,680
"How serious could a teenager's
secret really be?"

495
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:40,862
Well, whatever it was,

496
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:42,667
Carrie was dead
that night.

497
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,440
??????????????

498
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,607
Our Hearts Wait Club kids
are all here, boss.

499
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
One of these do-gooders

500
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:58,945
took out Carrie Swett 'cause
she found out their secret.

501
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,256
Not very Christian
of them.

502
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,224
At the very least,

503
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:04,348
they might have something
on each other,

504
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,147
so remind them
it's not high school anymore.

505
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,388
Put on
the heat,

506
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,833
they'll probably snitch
on each other in a second.

507
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,763
My secret was about
how I felt strange about sex.

508
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,450
I had guilt issues.

509
00:23:31,455 --> 00:23:33,256
Big deal.
I was raised Catholic.

510
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,795
Laurie, we think
someone killed Carrie

511
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:37,531
for a secret she read.

512
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:39,905
We were kids.

513
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,300
That's crazy.
Is it?

514
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,125
You're saying nobody in that
group had something to hide.

515
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,613
There were things
you just didn't talk about...

516
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,377
but Carrie did.

517
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,578
Like what?

518
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,573
Have you spoken
with Phil DiPreta?

519
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,786
You think we should?

520
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,493
No one else thought
it was a secret--

521
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,567
how Phil was--

522
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,428
but he did.

523
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,900
One time,

524
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:07,781
after the first meeting
Carrie came to,

525
00:24:08,457 --> 00:24:10,213
she made a big mistake.

526
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:16,801
Whoo!

527
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,245
Yeah, I'm trying to swear off
guys, too, especially that one.

528
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:37,985
What? Come on.

529
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,100
I know
you're afraid

530
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:42,380
to just tell the club, but
you should just be honest.

531
00:24:43,841 --> 00:24:45,056
I am honest.

532
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,027
I don't know
what you mean.

533
00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:48,488
Sorry, I got to go.

534
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,993
It's okay

535
00:24:49,994 --> 00:24:50,798
to be gay.

536
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,814
What?

537
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,780
Shut up.

538
00:24:52,884 --> 00:24:54,117
Oh, sorry, I...

539
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:55,000
I am not-- 

540
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:56,171
I am not that!

541
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,340
You're just some nobody,
so shut your mouth.

542
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,284
Phil's gay?

543
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,904
No.

544
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,240
Ask him.
He'll tell you

545
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:14,474
it's the biggest
sin there is.

546
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:20,151
You're saying
Carrie was off base.

547
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,595
I am married
with two kids.

548
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,236
What do you think?

549
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,425
So it didn't bother you,
her calling you a gay?

550
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:28,790
Yeah, of course it did.

551
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,444
So maybe you two get into a
fight, it gets out of hand.

552
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,512
No. No way.

553
00:25:33,747 --> 00:25:37,930
Laurie said you were livid, says
you're against all that stuff.

554
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,390
Laurie?

555
00:25:41,513 --> 00:25:43,313
Well, of course Laurie
would tell you to talk to me.

556
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,960
She got
something against you?

557
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:45,729

She had something against Carrie.

558
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,129


559
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:46,933
Her and Manny.

560
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,362
The boyfriend?

561
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,770
Pretended to be Mary
and Joseph, so perfect.

562
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,520
But that's not the case?

563
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,016
And Carrie Swett knew
all about it.

564
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:15,297
Are you okay?

565
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,317
I'm freaked out.

566
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,457
What's wrong?

567
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,349
Did you have a fight
with Manny?

568
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,207
How do you know

569
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,250
if you're pregnant?

570
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,713
You can't be pregnant.

571
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:29,900
You guys don't...

572
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:30,628
No, we do.

573
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,463
I know, I'm a
terrible person.

574
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,903
I say I won't, and then

575
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,466
when we're
together I want to.

576
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,207
No, you just need
to use protection.

577
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,700
He won't talk about it.

578
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,500
After we do it,

579
00:26:45,501 --> 00:26:46,330
he cries.

580
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:48,572
Why?
You guys are in love.

581
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,822
I think you're lucky.

582
00:26:51,366 --> 00:26:52,362
I'm not.

583
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,348
I'm dirty.

584
00:26:57,601 --> 00:26:58,567
What are you guys talking about?

585
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,400
You told her, didn't you?

586
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:03,868
It's okayManny.
Don't...

587
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:07,701
talk to my girlfriend ever again
or I'll make you pay.

588
00:27:23,882 --> 00:27:26,033
So Manny didn't want
anyone to know about them

589
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:27,365
knocking boots?

590
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:31,113
He was the most repressed,
controlled person ever,

591
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,269
and that can poison you

592
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,286
on the inside.

593
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,310
I think.

594
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:52,099
Carrie Swett knew that you
and Laurie were making a mockery

595
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,896
out of the club.

596
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,005
Had a pregnancy scare?

597
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,515
I was ashamed
of that.

598
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:59,730
We were lucky it
was just a scare.

599
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,147
Ashamed enough
to pick Carrie off,

600
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:03,400
let your secret die with her?

601
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,540
Not at all.

602
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,442
I slipped, yes.

603
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:10,036
Sure did... a few times.

604
00:28:10,203 --> 00:28:11,502
I lost my way in high school,

605
00:28:11,503 --> 00:28:13,256
but I found my way back
through God.

606
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:15,850
Seems like
once Carrie showed up,

607
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:18,345
quite a few of you
"lost your way."

608
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:20,910
Anything
you'd like

609
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:22,266
to get off your chest, Manny?

610
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:24,768
I usually try

611
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,470
to stay away
from female drama,

612
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:30,244
but one time after school
I saw something kind of weird.

613
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,043
Carrie!

614
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,180
Don't just run
away from me.

615
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,243
I don't get it.

616
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,664
You made me feel
like I was the bad...

617
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,820
Carrie, come back.

618
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,700
Carrie!

619
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:46,386
You're looking for love
in the wrong place.

620
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:48,000
You're just like me.

621
00:28:48,002 --> 00:28:49,568
I am nothing like you.

622
00:28:49,635 --> 00:28:50,375
It was wrong

623
00:28:50,635 --> 00:28:51,548
and I am telling.

624
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,780
No one will
believe you.

625
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,300
You're just some slut
with a whore for a mother.

626
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,506
After Carrie died,
Tina kind of went funny.

627
00:29:04,603 --> 00:29:06,401
What do you mean?
She walked around,

628
00:29:07,002 --> 00:29:10,335
like, with her hair all dirty
and not talking to anybody.

629
00:29:10,336 --> 00:29:13,002
You don't think she was
just mourning her friend?

630
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:14,406
They weren't friends.

631
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,267
Tina's friends
play by her rules

632
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:18,495
or they don't
play at all.

633
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:20,475
Carrie was done.

634
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:38,500
No.

635
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:42,082
No, I am not a person who yells.

636
00:29:43,143 --> 00:29:44,509
I am not a person who shoves.

637
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,828
That is not me.

638
00:29:45,943 --> 00:29:47,588
Witness saw
you, Tina.

639
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,123
You were looking for
love in the wrong place.

640
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,489
Maybe you didn't
deserve that ring?

641
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:55,522
I was a virgin
until my wedding night.

642
00:29:55,523 --> 00:29:56,770
You cannot slander
my character.

643
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,513
And where'd you say
your hubby was now?

644
00:29:59,515 --> 00:30:00,588
He's in Iraq.

645
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:03,881
Oh, Tina.

646
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:06,688
You just tell yourself lies,
don't you?

647
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:08,432
We got the papers

648
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:09,734
from the courthouse.

649
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,024
He filed for an annulment

650
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,405
three months ago.

651
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,733
He says the
marriage

652
00:30:15,735 --> 00:30:17,048
was never consummated.

653
00:30:17,735 --> 00:30:20,501
Can't let go of that
purity pledge, huh, Tina?

654
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:21,895
That's none of your business.

655
00:30:22,136 --> 00:30:23,672
What happened to you?

656
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,467
Why are you stuck
in time

657
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,490
like the club never ended?

658
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:28,567
Some kind of trauma?

659
00:30:28,573 --> 00:30:32,468
Yeah... actually,
but you guys don't even see it.

660
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,067
I've been having
these...

661
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:38,914
thoughts and dreams
and I'm not sure

662
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,407
if it's the devil
inside of me

663
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:42,979
or if it's God guiding me
or what.

664
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,831
What kind of thoughts?

665
00:30:52,572 --> 00:30:53,719
Sex thoughts.

666
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,005
Okay.

667
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:57,185
That's normal.

668
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,673
About you.

669
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,291
It's not normal.

670
00:31:01,107 --> 00:31:02,174
What's wrong
th me?

671
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:03,606
Hey, hey, heNE

672
00:31:03,673 --> 00:31:05,440
You don't even
have to look at me.

673
00:31:05,506 --> 00:31:08,506
You can turn
around if you want.

674
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,710
Okay?

675
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:11,922
Okay.

676
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:22,989
 one of them,

677
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,327
we were in my house

678
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,724
and I was like...

679
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,524
"Let's go for a swim."

680
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:35,920
In the pool?

681
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,807
And then...

682
00:31:40,763 --> 00:31:41,707
I was like...

683
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,043
"Don't wear your bathing suit,
Nathan, and I won't wear mine."

684
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,706
Uh-huh.

685
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,269
Go on.

686
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,539
So we were both
in the pool...

687
00:31:53,983 --> 00:31:54,756
I...

688
00:31:54,983 --> 00:31:55,916
Sorry, are
you...?

689
00:31:57,881 --> 00:31:58,930
Nathan!

690
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,974
Oh, my God.

691
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,506
What is wrong with you?

692
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,350
Carrie!

693
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,470
Carrie!

694
00:32:08,513 --> 00:32:10,197
Nathan was insanely mad.

695
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,315
Said he'd never be able
to be hired as a minister

696
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:15,547
if she told.

697
00:32:15,613 --> 00:32:18,582
He say anything
after she was killed?

698
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,783
I don't know.

699
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,976
He disbanded the club.

700
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,592
???????????????

701
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,540
trust you as a man of God.

702
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:39,818
You were a snake in the grass.

703
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,330
I was weak.

704
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:42,830
Tina...

705
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,896
kept coming to my
office every week

706
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,550
with these elaborate stories.

707
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,150
Oh, right, so now
Tina's to blame.

708
00:32:50,607 --> 00:32:52,849
No, it was my fault.

709
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,387
Tina was a troubled girl and...

710
00:32:57,474 --> 00:33:00,859
instead of helping her,
I took advantage.

711
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:03,350
Carrie Swett knew
what you were doing

712
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:04,284
and you beat her
to death.

713
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,887
I am to blame
for their corruption,

714
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,924
but I did not lay a hand
on Carrie Swett.

715
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,757
You saying one of
them did? The kids?

716
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,750
I was supposed to be
their guide and I was

717
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:22,756
so lost.

718
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,929
Nathan, if you know
anything about it,

719
00:33:29,996 --> 00:33:31,729
you need to do right by her.

720
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,673
I read it.

721
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,304
The secret Carrie found.

722
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:40,914
When?

723
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,298
The day she disappeared
after the meeting.

724
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,537
I thought maybe Tina had written
something about me, so...

725
00:33:55,935 --> 00:33:56,705
What did it say?

726
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,947
"Carrie is going to die."

727
00:34:05,707 --> 00:34:06,710
Which one wrote it?

728
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:08,622
I don't know.

729
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,822
I kept them hidden away.

730
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,250
God, forgive me.

731
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:35,740
Well, one of you confessed.

732
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,658
"Carrie is
going to die."

733
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,437
You wrote it down.

734
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,667
You wanted God
to take your burden away,

735
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:47,338
but He didn't.

736
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,613
Did He, Phil?

737
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:53,455
I didn't write that.
Phil.

738
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:54,827
Calm down.

739
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,125
You used to be good kids.

740
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,254
Good students,
traditional values.

741
00:35:02,255 --> 00:35:03,663
What happened?

742
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:06,349
Carrie happened.

743
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,250
She came and corrupted you.

744
00:35:08,617 --> 00:35:11,239
Talking to you
about premarital sex,

745
00:35:11,584 --> 00:35:13,050
and you about being gay,

746
00:35:13,116 --> 00:35:15,249
and, well, you.

747
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,363
Everybody knows about you.

748
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,966
No? Oh, you didn't share
with the group?

749
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,333
Carrie saw you and Nathan.

750
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,588
Nathan crossed a line with me,
that is true.

751
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:39,969
And you came back

752
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,128
every week to let him cross it.

753
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,227
Little Miss Virginity,

754
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,680
exposed by the slut.

755
00:35:45,684 --> 00:35:47,016
Right?
Please.

756
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,000
Why is it some

757
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:51,633
great mystery, how some
screwed-up girl died?

758
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:53,118
Didn't just die,

759
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,100
she was stoned to death.

760
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,270
Kind of fitting.

761
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,753
But you know that.

762
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,567
She was a corruptive
influence on all of us.

763
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,465
No, she wasn't.

764
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,760
What we were doing
wasn't corrupt.

765
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,481
True.

766
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,124
It wasn't until
you went into the woods.

767
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,443
See her footprints.

768
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,672
Oh, she ran like hell,
didn't she?

769
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:19,793
Then she stopped
and changed direction here,

770
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,830
here, here and here.

771
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,300
Four times.

772
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,530
Something got in her way.

773
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,651
Something strong
wouldn't let her escape.

774
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,230
One, two, three, four obstacles.

775
00:36:34,547 --> 00:36:36,360
You were all there
in the woods with her.

776
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:39,402
You killed
Carrie Swett together.

777
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,850
You all made Carrie die
for your sins.

778
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:48,360
You have to confess...

779
00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:52,257
...to be forgiven.

780
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,883
I hated her for using that word.

781
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,356
Gay.

782
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,780
So I tricked Carrie into coming
to the woods with me.

783
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,003
I don't want
to be different.

784
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:26,032
I don't want to be alone.

785
00:37:26,616 --> 00:37:27,822
You don't have to be.

786
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:29,340
You can love someone.

787
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,730
You can be who you are.

788
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:42,697
You want to go for a walk?

789
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:47,115
Sure.

790
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:56,950
And then what?

791
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,570
I can't do this.
Manny, don't.

792
00:37:58,973 --> 00:38:00,171
Please stay.

793
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:01,944
I wrote it down.

794
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,276
What we were going to do.

795
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:10,593
I wanted someone to stop us.

796
00:38:15,816 --> 00:38:17,226
I waited for her.

797
00:38:17,783 --> 00:38:18,879
With Tina.

798
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,647
Tina convinced us.

799
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,656
I wanted to get rid
of Carrie, too,

800
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,500
and everything
she reminded me of,

801
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:32,500
but then we were in the
woods and it was real,

802
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:35,500
and I wanted to run,
but my feet wouldn't...

803
00:38:35,507 --> 00:38:36,250
Shut up!

804
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,677
Shut up!

805
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:39,357
What are we going to do
when she gets here?

806
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:40,200
What do we do?

807
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:41,810
We kill her.

808
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,608
We stepped out of the shadows.

809
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:55,797
And I think right away
 he knew.

810
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,854
And then we made
a circle around her.

811
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,107
I don't know
who started yelling,

812
00:39:24,174 --> 00:39:25,873
but we were just
calling her names.

813
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,613
Bitch.
Slut.

814
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,070
Dirty whore!

815
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,860
Please, Phil, help me.

816
00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:36,100
What are you doing?

817
00:39:36,116 --> 00:39:38,450
You have to stop
saying things to me

818
00:39:38,517 --> 00:39:39,603
that are not true!

819
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,000
Laurie.

820
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:44,000
You poisoned us

821
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:45,354
and now God doesn't love us.

822
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,753
You guys...

823
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,647
please!

824
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,474
And then...

825
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,340
I hit her.

826
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,884
You're taking him away from me!

827
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:00,374
We can't.

828
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,077
Deuteronomy.

829
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,750
A whore should be stoned.

830
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,087
"So shalt thou put evil away
among you!"

831
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,377
No!

832
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
Do it!

833
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:26,451
I'm sorry.

834
00:40:26,452 --> 00:40:28,575
I'm... sorry.

835
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,366
You guys, she's still breathing.

836
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,023
Manny, do something.

837
00:40:47,343 --> 00:40:48,530
Manny!
I can't!

838
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,576
I let her die in the woods.

839
00:41:02,578 --> 00:41:04,548
I hit her. I helped kill her,
t was a blur.

840
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,981
I killed her.
I don't know why I did.

841
00:41:07,684 --> 00:41:08,871
I killed Carrie.

842
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,177
I killed Carrie Swett.

843
00:41:15,566 --> 00:41:25,300
