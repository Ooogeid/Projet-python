1
00:00:00,038 --> 00:00:01,700
Previously on cold case :

2
00:00:01,747 --> 00:00:03,540
Celeste.... my wife's name.

3
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:06,065
We have a daughter maggie
and a son finn.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,422
They want
to meet you.

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,577
I don't like you, John.

6
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:11,093
You ever mess with someone
under my command again...

7
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:12,566
What you gonna do, John ?

8
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:16,454
I will beat the ever-
Loving crap out of you.

9
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:17,799
Are you asking me out
on a date ?

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,000
What do you say ?

11
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:21,062
You going to feed me first ?

12
00:00:21,107 --> 00:00:22,156
Got you, Moe.

13
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:24,257
Took another look
at those campus car records.

14
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:26,340
It was you who checked out
one of those cars.

15
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,034
You put that girl
in a box !

16
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,693
I put you there, too,
sweetheart.

17
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:31,658
You panicked
when my partner got too close.

18
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:34,411
Ran her off the road
in that same car.

19
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:41,012
<i>" I got a woman"
by Ray Charles.</i>

20
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,913
................

21
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:07,388
Look at her, Grace.

22
00:01:07,423 --> 00:01:09,451
She's bigger
than all of south Philly.

23
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,430
It's not too late to
change our minds, darcy.

24
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:14,106
You kidding ? Two weeks
sipping wine in france,

25
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,891
a trip back on her last
atlantic crossing ever.

26
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:20,150
This is going to be
the adventure of a lifetime.

27
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:22,275
- Henry ?
- Darcy, wait.

28
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,920
What are you waiting for ?
Go.

29
00:01:28,493 --> 00:01:30,342
Henry, what are you doing here ?

30
00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:32,767
Couldn't just let you go.
Come on, let's talk about this.

31
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:35,552
- We already talked.
- I just thought

32
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:38,048
maybe if you saw this...

33
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:40,568
Even had it engraved, see ?

34
00:01:40,603 --> 00:01:42,221
"D.C. from H.S."

35
00:01:43,923 --> 00:01:46,291
Henry, I-I can't, I...

36
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:49,396
Keep it. You'll come to your senses once
you get this dumb trip out of your system.

37
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:50,690
I've got to go.

38
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:52,152
You've never been
outside of Philly.

39
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:53,947
All of a sudden you're
shipping off to Europe ?

40
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:55,797
- You think you're the queen of England ?
- Good-bye, Henry.

41
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:57,082
Darcy, wait.

42
00:01:58,555 --> 00:02:00,255
I'm done waiting for you.

43
00:02:26,891 --> 00:02:29,162
Did you actually ever see
my client

44
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:30,915
at the wheel of the vehicle

45
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,295
that you claim ran
your car off the bridge

46
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:36,586
on may 6, 2009 ?

47
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:39,892
- No.
- So your accusations are based

48
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,514
solely on circumstantial
evidence.

49
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:44,358
Well, the evidence being
three speeding tickets

50
00:02:44,393 --> 00:02:45,704
for Moe Kitchener on the
school-owned vehicle,

51
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:49,068
neighbors testifying he parked
the suburban at his house every night

52
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:50,733
- except the night he was dumping...
- Your Honor...

53
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:52,449
- ... Kate Butler's body in Germantown.
- Your honor !

54
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:55,198
Paint scrapings and dents
are an exact match

55
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:56,505
to the damage on my car,

56
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,489
not to mention the 12 stitches
on the back of my skull.

57
00:02:58,524 --> 00:02:59,734
Your Honor !

58
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:02,881
The school may have owned
the vehicle on paper,

59
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,997
but it was your client's car,

60
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:06,289
- and everyone knew it.
- Your honor,

61
00:03:06,324 --> 00:03:09,377
move that detective Rush's last two
statements be struck from the record.

62
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:11,712
You opened the door,
counselor.

63
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:19,160
- I do all right ?
- Tore that jackwipe a new one.

64
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:21,200
- Nice job, Lil.
- Should have seen the look

65
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,823
on major Moe's face
when you went off like that.

66
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:25,865
Knocked that smirk
off his ugly mug.

67
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,150
You did good.

68
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:30,756
Well, it'd be better
if we had you up there.

69
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,579
Yeah. I begged the D.A.
to let me have it,

70
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,039
but attempted homicide
on a police officer in bucks county

71
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:38,830
carries more weight
than the Philly charges.

72
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:40,817
What the hell
is he staring at ?

73
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:43,615
20 to life with any luck.

74
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:45,249
Come on.

75
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,352
SS Americana.
They called her "the Big A."

76
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:51,476
Fastest ocean liner ever built.

77
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:54,873
Thing's been rusting away
on the pier long as I can remember.

78
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:56,930
Decommissioned in '66.

79
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:58,025
Before jets took over,

80
00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:00,526
this was the way
to travel to Europe in style.

81
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,834
Styling or not,

82
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,723
couldn't drag me out
on a boat for that long.

83
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:08,461
- Never got your sea legs, Scotty ?
- I'm seasick just thinking about it.

84
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:12,260
New owners are working her over,
trying to refit her for service again.

85
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:13,925
Came across this last night.
Bag of bones in a red dress.

86
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,441
Salvage operations stripped
everything else down to the metal,

87
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:20,537
but this engine room was
sealed off 40 years ago.

88
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:21,980
Navy-built state secret.

89
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:23,966
So nobody gets in or out.

90
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:25,144
Till now.

91
00:04:25,814 --> 00:04:28,014
Take a look at her neck, Lil.

92
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:33,339
"D.C. from H.S."

93
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:36,655
D.C. Matches a passenger
named Darcy Curtis.

94
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,254
It was reported she jumped overboard
during the ship's final crossing.

95
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,358
Missed the water
by a few hundred yards.

96
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:44,161
Big A was known as
"the suicide ship."

97
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:47,176
The jumpers would leave their shoes
on the deck. Nobody really knows why.

98
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:48,384
No shoes here.

99
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,995
Master-at-arms found them
against the "suicide rail"

100
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,329
morning she went missing,
couple hours before they docked.

101
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:56,943
Shoes on the deck, body
stuffed in the engine room.

102
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:00,788
Suicide ship's starting to
look more like a murder ship.

103
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:06,546
<b>COLD CASE</b>

104
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:14,617
<b>Saison 7 Épisode 01</b>

105
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:22,961
<b>Synchro :
Cold Team from Italians sub addicted</b>

106
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:32,794
<b>The crossing</b>

107
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:44,627
M.E. report's back.

108
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:47,411
Dental records confirm
remains are darcy curtis.

109
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:50,362
- Broken neck from the fall.
- It's a remote area of the ship.

110
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,858
Somebody would have to know their
way around pretty good to find it.

111
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:53,936
This the whole file ?

112
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:56,414
Captain's incident report
from the suicide investigation ?

113
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:58,014
Passenger lists, crew reports,

114
00:05:58,015 --> 00:05:59,515
all in private hands now.

115
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:01,639
It's weird leaving
shoes like that.

116
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:04,004
Nice kicks.
Shame to get them wet.

117
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:08,078
Telegram sent from the ship to Darcy's
boyfriend in Fishtown, Henry Speck.

118
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:09,226
"I can't."

119
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:11,163
Can't what ? Swim ?

120
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:13,125
Speck gave a statement,
said he thought it was Darcy

121
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:15,326
saying no to his marriage proposal.

122
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,447
Till he heard she disappeared.
Died in '98.

123
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:21,935
The telegram had a time-stamp.
Sent at 4:04 am.

124
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,659
42 minutes later, she's reported
lost at sea by the master-at-arms.

125
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:27,627
Her traveling companion,
Grace Stearns,

126
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:30,028
confirms she was missing later
that morning.

127
00:06:30,062 --> 00:06:31,668
Id'd her off the shoes.

128
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:33,724
Lil and scotty are
talking to her now.

129
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,014
We knew each other
from when we were kids.

130
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:44,379
Morning Darcy disappeared,
you remember when you last saw her ?

131
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:45,664
Night before.

132
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:48,047
I had gone to bed early.

133
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:51,660
Darcy was more the
life of the party.

134
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,295
But she never came
back to our room.

135
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:57,131
Darcy's boyfriend, Henry Speck,

136
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:01,356
got a telegram morning
she was killed. Says "I can't."

137
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:06,250
It's the only thing he had
to go on all these years.

138
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:08,712
Trying to figure out
why she did it.

139
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:11,571
I guess it's not
a suicide note anymore.

140
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:14,452
- Henry had proposed to her ?
- In a telegram,

141
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:16,049
while we were on the ship.

142
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:18,347
I was so excited for her.

143
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:20,218
My late husband, Chester,

144
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:22,574
he was Henry's cousin.

145
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,916
- But she said no.
- Why's that ?

146
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,172
She meet another guy
on the ship ?

147
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:30,913
There was a man she was after
on that ship.

148
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:33,224
Just not in the way you think.

149
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:38,125
<i>"We don't see eye to eye"
by RAY CHARLES.</i>

150
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:42,328
Since you got that telegram,
you've been nothing but doom and gloom.

151
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:44,094
Darcy, what is it ?

152
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:46,898
I've just been thinking.

153
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:49,801
How beautiful Paris was.

154
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,011
The art, the people
who live there.

155
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:54,145
Everyone with their hand out
waiting for a tip.

156
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,721
I mean, Chester was right.

157
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:57,702
The french
are completely ungrateful.

158
00:07:57,737 --> 00:07:59,405
Here, read it yourself.

159
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:00,889
"Marry me."

160
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:03,044
Darcy !
Henry finally proposed !

161
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,840
Yeah, in a telegram.

162
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,394
Well, who cares ?

163
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:08,738
All you have to do now
is say yes.

164
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:10,860
Aren't you happy ?

165
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:13,173
It's what you always wanted.

166
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:17,576
I know. That's what I keep
telling myself. And then...

167
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:21,998
You don't see any of those parisian women
waiting around for a man.

168
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:25,435
They're off at museums, reading,
talking to friends in cafe's.

169
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,914
Not more of that
feminism jargon.

170
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:30,214
We are from Philly, Darcy.

171
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:32,726
France is... France.

172
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:40,427
"Captain's ballroom"

173
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:42,835
I don't know, Grace.

174
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,784
Do you ever just...

175
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:48,067
feel like you could do better ?

176
00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:58,220
Darcy, listen to me.

177
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:00,558
Henry is one of the
last good men.

178
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:03,112
They don't come along every day,
and when they do,

179
00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:05,741
you gotta snap them up
and be grateful.

180
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:08,617
Like you and Chester ?

181
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:11,130
He let me come along here
with you, didn't he ?

182
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:24,636
Darcy !

183
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:30,988
Darcy, come back !

184
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:35,359
I don't know what
she did to that man,

185
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:38,250
but she came back a few minutes later
with the necklace.

186
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,631
She say anything
about how she got it ?

187
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,267
Said she just
flat out demanded it.

188
00:09:43,302 --> 00:09:44,771
It sounds like he knew
his way around.

189
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:46,611
Is it possible
he worked on the ship ?

190
00:09:46,646 --> 00:09:50,390
Well, he wore those,
uniform pants

191
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,624
and those shoes
they all wore.

192
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:53,854
Rough-looking guy.

193
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:54,966
When did this happen ?

194
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:57,021
Day after we left Southampton.

195
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:59,996
Didn't faze Darcy,
but me,

196
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,327
I-I never left
the room after that.

197
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:07,506
Ship enthusiast

198
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,107
wants a court order
for me look at any of her stuff.

199
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:12,466
Took all the charm I got just
to talk her out of this box.

200
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,212
Looks like you hit the big a mother lode.

201
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,418
Every passenger manifest,
crew list,

202
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:18,519
captain's log from the SS Americana.

203
00:10:18,553 --> 00:10:19,561
Check it out.

204
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:21,916
Kitchen worker : Cotter Doyle,

205
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,717
picked up by the sergeant-at-arms
on the final voyage.

206
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:29,354
Petty theft, stealing cash
and jewelry in tourist class.

207
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:31,668
Detention in quarters
the last day of the trip.

208
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:34,891
Doyle's quarters are on the
same deck as the engine room.

209
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,415
So Darcy reports the guy;
suddenly he's cooling his heels

210
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,113
50 feet from where
the body's found.

211
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:42,494
Guys.
Judge is back.

212
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:45,815
All rise.

213
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,796
Sit.
Bailiff, bring in the defendant.

214
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:57,292
- What's he doing in street clothes ?
- What the hell ?

215
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:59,058
Not good.

216
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:04,701
Given the defendant's lack of
previous legal entanglements,

217
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:06,104
his stature in the community,

218
00:11:06,105 --> 00:11:09,005
and his lengthy and
laudable military service,

219
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,471
the commonwealth's request
for bail at $1 million

220
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:13,072
seems excessive.

221
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,272
In light of these facts,

222
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,173
and major Kitchener's
perceived lack of flight risk,

223
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:19,851
I'm going to grant defense's
motion for bail reduction.

224
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:21,917
Trial date to be determined.

225
00:11:21,952 --> 00:11:23,470
The defendant is released,

226
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:24,771
sign own bond.

227
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:26,804
Bailiff, uncuff the major.

228
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:31,418
Thank you, Your Honor.

229
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,270
He's walking.

230
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:50,723
Had the son of a bitch
on the ropes.

231
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:52,683
Pritchard and the judge
are both ex-military.

232
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:54,517
May be a case for judicial bias,

233
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:56,018
but it's bucks county's call.

234
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:58,384
Should have done it in Philly,
kept it close to home.

235
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,194
All misdemeanors in philly.
He'd be walking anyway.

236
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:03,384
You said they had the case to
keep him in jail till the trial.

237
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:05,753
We have any recourse ?
File a motion, something ?

238
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:07,987
We got nothing. He's out
till they get a conviction.

239
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:09,653
What kind of chance
we got of that now ?

240
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,266
Come on, guys. You can't control
the judges. You know that.

241
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:15,393
All I know is the guy who tried
to kill me is on the street.

242
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:19,560
Bad day ?

243
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,166
Matter of fact, yeah.

244
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:28,049
But let's try and keep my bad
day from becoming your bad day.

245
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,851
- Either way, it beats working.
- Working.

246
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:34,537
A 60-something-year-old bellboy.
That's a stellar career track, Doyle.

247
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:36,821
Rehabilitative opportunity.

248
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:38,896
Mind my ps and qs,

249
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:41,097
maybe I get to stay
on this side of the bars for a while.

250
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:44,331
Booted off the big a
for sticky fingers in '66.

251
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:46,321
You got 20 theft counts
on your record since.

252
00:12:46,322 --> 00:12:47,722
What the hell's
the matter with you ?

253
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:49,856
It's medical. I got a condition.

254
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,397
Pathological kleptomania.
I can't help myself.

255
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:56,584
That what happened with Darcy
Curtis back on the SS Americana ?

256
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:57,663
Who ?

257
00:12:57,907 --> 00:12:59,738
I don't know any Darcy Curtis.

258
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:02,328
No ? 'cause we got a witness putting you
in her stateroom

259
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:03,929
with your condition.

260
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:06,825
Now, she came after you.
A day later, she winds up dead.

261
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,001
50 feet from where you were
"detained in quarters."

262
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:11,928
Murdered ?

263
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,271
They-they said she jumped.

264
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:17,006
Yeah, off a landing
in the engine room.

265
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:21,495
Walk me through this, Doyle.

266
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:23,993
All right. She files a report
against your thieving ass,

267
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:26,362
- and it stirs up a mess of trouble...
- No report.

268
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:27,990
She didn't want trouble.

269
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,453
But there was something
she wanted.

270
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:39,454
<i>"What'd I say"
by Ray Charles.</i>

271
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:47,276
Give it.

272
00:13:47,814 --> 00:13:49,142
What, are you crazy ?

273
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:51,443
It's just a hunk of silver to you.

274
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:54,225
All right. No hard feelings then ?

275
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,860
I ought to turn you in.

276
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,932
I'm hooked in on this ship.

277
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:00,195
- Anything you want, I can get it.
- Really ?

278
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,080
Tickets to a show ?
Private tour,

279
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:04,881
extra towels ? You name it.

280
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:07,571
Captain's ballroom.

281
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:10,539
Oh, you want to go shake it
with the mucket-mucks.

282
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:13,899
I can get you
in the busboy entrance.

283
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,845
- When ?
- Tonight.

284
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:18,456
So I just... show up ?

285
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:20,122
Lady, all you need are
the right shoes

286
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:22,723
and the right attitude.

287
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,324
Miss thang.

288
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:29,836
She had the attitude covered.
That's for sure.

289
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:31,292
You saying
she didn't turn you in ?

290
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:33,774
You can ask
the first class head steward.

291
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,648
Commodore tightass.

292
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:39,093
Gave me hell
for sneaking her in there.

293
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,411
Know where she got
the snazzy shoes ?

294
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:44,955
Nope. But if she had been wearing
those in the captain's ballroom that night,

295
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:48,415
she would have never got caught.

296
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,330
Come here.

297
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:06,853
You defended me.

298
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:10,384
- What ?
- Bucks county courthouse, 2:14 pm.

299
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:11,611
You defended me.

300
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:13,733
- No I didn't.
- You totally did.

301
00:15:13,768 --> 00:15:15,258
What's your point, Curtis ?

302
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:17,842
Nothing. Just, you won't go out
on a second date with me,

303
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:20,413
but you will go to bat for me
in front of your crew.

304
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:22,205
I didn't say I wouldn't
go out with you again.

305
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,697
You're just not returning my calls.

306
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:25,798
I thought you didn't use voice mail.

307
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:27,406
Come on, Kat.

308
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:28,780
I thought...

309
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:32,660
I thought we had
a good dinner.

310
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:34,395
Good conversation.

311
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:36,226
- Great wine.
- Right ?

312
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,614
- '90 bordeaux.
- Perfect with the filet.

313
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:39,753
Yeah.

314
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:42,145
So, what the hell happened ?

315
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:46,160
You took me home

316
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,837
and you didn't even...

317
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,412
I mean, I thought we had a thing,

318
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:52,713
and then I wasn't sure.

319
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:54,673
And I just... Look, I don't have
a lot of time. .

320
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:57,774
I got a kid, and so do you.
You know, I don't know..

321
00:16:05,662 --> 00:16:06,933
So ?

322
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,946
What do you say ?

323
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:11,689
Uh, yeah.

324
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:13,502
All right, then.

325
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:14,844
Good.

326
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,059
Um, got to go.

327
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,813
What's up with Miller ?

328
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:35,805
Good question.

329
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,698
- What do you got ?
- Those shoes left on the deck ?

330
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:40,001
Turns out they're
Gloria marks.

331
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:42,906
- What, designer ?
- One of a kind. Very expensive.

332
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:44,524
Exclusively sold two places :

333
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,756
a boutique in Milan
and on board the SS Americana.

334
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,917
Too rich for Darcy's
steerage budget.

335
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:52,459
Question is, who bought
Cinderella her slippers ?

336
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:54,436
Found our first class
head steward.

337
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,042
Crew log has him
as Geoffrey Manning.

338
00:16:57,077 --> 00:16:59,916
He's standing right next to Darcy.
Opportunity to spare.

339
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:01,935
Knew the ship,
the engine room...

340
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,842
Works as a maitre D'
at Gibbs steakhouse

341
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:05,043
on Rittenhouse square now.

342
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:08,542
Gibbs ? Same family that owned
the liner company that ran the Big A ?

343
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:09,910
The one and only.

344
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,968
I've been trying to get a
reservation there for years.

345
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:13,169
They're always booked.

346
00:17:13,217 --> 00:17:14,553
I got this one.

347
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,183
Go get' em, tiger.

348
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:24,332
Allow me to check
our reservation book

349
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,752
I'm sorry, sir,

350
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:29,879
but that night is
completely booked, as well.

351
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:31,977
I'm so sorry. Right.

352
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:36,595
What can I do for you,
detective ?

353
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:40,015
- That obvious, huh ?
- It's the shoes.

354
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:46,368
You remember this lady ?
Name's darcy curtis.

355
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,002
You want to look at it ?

356
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:51,766
Or is that like your little trick with
the nonexistent reservation book ?

357
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:53,926
I'm sure you can see
that I'm very busy.

358
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:57,068
Falling all over yourself
keeping the Gibbs family happy.

359
00:17:57,227 --> 00:18:00,078
- First on their ship, now here.
- It's called loyalty, detective.

360
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,244
And it's a two-way street.

361
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,244
Well, I ain't in a hurry.

362
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,117
I'm just going to call up
a few of my...

363
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,586
Cheap shoe-wearing buddies,

364
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:08,971
knock back a few at the bar.

365
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:11,872
Carpet's treated for fluids, right ?

366
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,969
I remember her.
Mixed-up girl.

367
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:20,318
She jumped overboard
on our last voyage.

368
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:22,769
- Very sad.
- Found her yesterday

369
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:25,291
in the engine room,
her body stuffed under a stairwell.

370
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:27,557
Heard you booted her out
of the captain's ballroom

371
00:18:27,592 --> 00:18:29,875
night before she died.
Same night as that picture.

372
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,257
Well, I did see her that night,

373
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:33,358
but I wasn't the one
who gave her a problem.

374
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:43,426
Where did you get this outfit ?
It's perfectly obscene.

375
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:45,285
Those shoes.

376
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,605
I know who you are.

377
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,219
You-you do ?

378
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,678
They told me the
Countess of Montpensier

379
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,967
was travelling incognito.

380
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:57,109
Oh, don't worry. No one will
recognize you in that.

381
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:59,394
Your secret is safe with me.

382
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:02,970
There you are, darling.
I've been looking all over for you.

383
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:06,002
- You're with the countess ?
- Duke...

384
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,698
of wilkes-Barre.
Now, if you'll excuse us...

385
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:13,076
That woman is
an insufferable gossip.

386
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:15,777
I figured I'd spare you,
seeing that you're...

387
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:18,304
- New to the scene.
- I beg you pardon.

388
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:19,805
Didn't you hear ?

389
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:21,368
I'm a countess.

390
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:22,436
Well...

391
00:19:22,785 --> 00:19:24,684
That's not going to save you
from that officious steward

392
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:27,541
headed over to boot you out
on your royal ass.

393
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,656
Piano, quick.

394
00:19:32,596 --> 00:19:34,550
- Think you can keep up ?
- Please.

395
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,635
Don't you read
your society pages ?

396
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:43,636
<i>"People will say we're in love"
by Ray Charles.</i>

397
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:27,600
Grace ?

398
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:41,163
After that, I didn't have the heart
to kick her out.

399
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,469
Things had been going so well
before her friend became...

400
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:48,266
- chemically inconvenienced.
- What about this "duke" ?

401
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:50,344
- Piano man got a name ?
- Not sure.

402
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:53,238
Ship had no shortage of
eligible bachelors that night.

403
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:56,288
Miss Curtis's singing
made quite an impression.

404
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:57,986
You ever see her again
after that night ?

405
00:20:58,021 --> 00:20:59,892
She left a few minutes later.

406
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:03,577
I never saw her
or her charming friend again.

407
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:11,974
Heard about what happened
in court today, Lil.

408
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:13,317
He smiled at me.

409
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,285
The bastard smiled at me, boss.

410
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,331
You let it get personal,
Lil, it could get messy.

411
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,568
It's already messy.

412
00:21:21,603 --> 00:21:24,903
Guy ran me off the road.
And now he's walking.

413
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:27,887
Just do your job.
Let the rest work itself out.

414
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:31,080
- I'm not sure I can do that.
- Well, find a way.

415
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:33,165
You've got to get
past this, Lil.

416
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:36,537
Moe will get his day.

417
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:51,734
Were you a happily married
woman

418
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:53,544
back in '66, Grace ?

419
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,272
Well, of course.

420
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:59,157
Chester was one
of the last good men.

421
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:01,038
You ever cheat on him ?

422
00:22:01,282 --> 00:22:02,781
What kind of question is that ?

423
00:22:02,816 --> 00:22:06,664
We heard about you hooking up with
some tosspot casanova from first class,

424
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:08,129
slinking down to his room.

425
00:22:08,164 --> 00:22:09,296
Oh, my God.

426
00:22:09,331 --> 00:22:11,435
I can see why you
didn't bring that up

427
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,919
- last time we talked.
- That wasn't me.

428
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:15,356
That was the liquor.

429
00:22:15,357 --> 00:22:17,957
It's the first time
I ever drank like that.

430
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:20,491
You worried about Darcy
keeping a lid on it ?

431
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:23,292
Afraid she'd tell Chester
about your night of romance ?

432
00:22:23,327 --> 00:22:25,498
Darcy didn't judge me for it.

433
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:28,533
She said I was hard enough
on myself.

434
00:22:29,788 --> 00:22:31,813
I was so ashamed.

435
00:22:34,612 --> 00:22:37,816
The guy darcy was hanging with
at the party,

436
00:22:38,138 --> 00:22:40,631
- you ever catch his name ?
- No, she never told me.

437
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,329
But whoever he was,

438
00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:44,174
he was trouble.

439
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:50,175
<i>"Hide nor hair"
by Ray Charles.</i>

440
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,321
"Dear countess of Montpensier..."

441
00:23:02,184 --> 00:23:03,445
Thank you.

442
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,453
"...the duke of Wilkes-Barre
requests the honor

443
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:11,225
of your presence at dinner for two

444
00:23:12,043 --> 00:23:13,837
Oh ! Isn't it romantic ?

445
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:15,627
I can only wonder
what he wants in return.

446
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,872
Oh, please, Grace.
Let me enjoy this.

447
00:23:18,754 --> 00:23:21,214
Oh ! If only it were that easy.

448
00:23:21,726 --> 00:23:24,226
Where are the seasick pills ?

449
00:23:28,526 --> 00:23:29,920
What are these ?

450
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:31,019
Nothing.

451
00:23:31,054 --> 00:23:32,309
Birth control pills ?

452
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,976
Darcy, is this what you were bought
at the pharmacy near the champs d'elysee ?

453
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:36,361
So what if it is ?

454
00:23:37,103 --> 00:23:39,203
Times are changing, Grace.

455
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:42,067
I can tell.

456
00:23:42,136 --> 00:23:43,899
Just not sure
if it's for the better.

457
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:45,177
Of course it is.

458
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:47,820
The first time in my life that
I feel like I have a choice,

459
00:23:47,821 --> 00:23:49,021
and I like it.

460
00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:51,452
I just hope that you're thinking
this through.

461
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,882
I'm not.

462
00:23:55,945 --> 00:23:58,545
And that's what feels
so damn good about it.

463
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,315
Isn't it beautiful ?

464
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,893
Maybe she was right.
I don't know.

465
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,951
And this is the night
Darcy disappeared ?

466
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:17,466
She put on those clothes
and she went to meet him.

467
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,767
Oh, it's the last time
I saw her,

468
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:24,648
and I was so petty
about her stupid pills.

469
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:27,024
Sure you weren't jealous,

470
00:24:27,144 --> 00:24:30,155
all that attention Darcy was getting ?
- Well, sure,

471
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:34,145
who wouldn't want to be
Cinderella for a night ?

472
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:36,878
There's a ledger
from the onboard boutique.

473
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:40,151
A big order on the account
of Tucker Benton.

474
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,866
Five dresses, six pairs
of shoes... expensive.

475
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:45,607
"Tucker Benton."

476
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,769
Name wasn't on the passenger list.

477
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,270
That's because
he wasn't a passenger.

478
00:24:49,344 --> 00:24:52,133
He was an employee
of Gibbs shipping lines.

479
00:24:52,168 --> 00:24:54,024
Took care of the first-class service.

480
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,725
Just got this from the library.

481
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:58,795
Tucker Benton was engaged
to the boss's daughter.

482
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,974
Heiress apparent
to the Gibbs family fortune.

483
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:02,761
Explains how he got
the cush job,

484
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:04,662
living the life of Reilly
on that ship.

485
00:25:04,696 --> 00:25:05,719
Where's he today ?

486
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,086
Lives on a boat down at Penn's landing.
Long John Stillman

487
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:11,426
is on his way with Scotty,
see what's what.

488
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,425
Excuse me.

489
00:25:16,704 --> 00:25:20,008
So, those wingtips
you clunk around in,

490
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:21,909
how much they set you back ?

491
00:25:23,514 --> 00:25:27,044
Well, if you gotta ask,
you don't wanna know.

492
00:25:29,673 --> 00:25:31,302
All right, look...

493
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:34,934
Talk to my man.
He'll set you up.

494
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:42,809
Beat it.

495
00:25:45,654 --> 00:25:47,957
You got it, didn't you ?

496
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,727
The trial date.

497
00:25:51,644 --> 00:25:53,201
Oh, uh, looking at may 15.

498
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:56,225
Eight months ?

499
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,248
Guy's gonna be out there ?

500
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,535
Yeah.

501
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,170
Listen...

502
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:08,325
I'm sorry about all this.

503
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:12,781
I'm not the one
you should be sorry for.

504
00:26:20,765 --> 00:26:22,982
Chris craft, '66.

505
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:26,512
Yeah.

506
00:26:26,784 --> 00:26:29,794
37-foot,
Sparkman Stevens design.

507
00:26:30,013 --> 00:26:34,017
Winter in Grenada. Gotta move quick
before the weather gets fresh.

508
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:38,977
Nice ride, but it doesn't hold a candle
to the big a, though, does it ?

509
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,610
What's this about ?

510
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:44,010
The great thing about sailing,
there's no laws out there on the high seas.

511
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:47,149
- You can get away with anything.
- Like with Darcy Curtis.

512
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,439
What are you talking about ?

513
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,596
Darcy...

514
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,877
- Jumped overboard.
- They found her body on the ship

515
00:26:53,952 --> 00:26:57,468
wearing a fancy dress. Any idea where
she might have gotten it from ?

516
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:01,469
I bought it for her.

517
00:27:02,361 --> 00:27:03,411
My God,

518
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:06,233
what happened to her ?

519
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:07,834
You give a statement
when she disappeared ?

520
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:09,751
No, no, I didn't.

521
00:27:09,983 --> 00:27:12,655
It's strange, seeing as you were
with her that night, right ?

522
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,173
Are you saying that I had something
to do with hurting Darcy ?

523
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:18,078
You had a lot to lose, anyone
found out about the affair.

524
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:21,105
Thinking about your fiance
in particular.

525
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:24,646
Millie and I...
our engagement was a mistake.

526
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:27,310
I called it off the day
we docked. Ask her yourself.

527
00:27:27,494 --> 00:27:28,437
I will.

528
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,792
Until Darcy came along,
there was only one lady for me :

529
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,805
the SS Americana.

530
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,242
This is the romantic spot ?

531
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:45,771
Gotta say, duke... your castle
kind of smells like engine oil.

532
00:27:46,344 --> 00:27:50,348
This... is the most beautiful
spot on the ship.

533
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:53,066
All those gorgeous lines
topside, all that finery,

534
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:55,413
it's nothing
without this room,

535
00:27:55,538 --> 00:27:58,383
this fire in her belly
pushing her on.

536
00:27:58,614 --> 00:28:01,635
- I sound like a lunatic.
- Stark Raving.

537
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:04,830
You know,  it's...

538
00:28:04,955 --> 00:28:08,959
it's the same thing
I see in you, Darcy.

539
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:14,736
Beautiful, but that
same fire inside.

540
00:28:18,737 --> 00:28:22,737
<i>"Careless love"
by Ray Charles.</i>

541
00:28:32,057 --> 00:28:35,240
Let me, let me guess. Some handsome
Joe back home gave this to you, right ?

542
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,245
- It's not what you think.
- What is it, then ?

543
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,370
It just...

544
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,449
reminds me of who I was.

545
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,929
Well... at least, who I think I was.

546
00:28:45,378 --> 00:28:48,176
- And what kind of person is that ?
- The kind who falls in line,

547
00:28:48,301 --> 00:28:50,276
accepts things
the way they are.

548
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:53,267
Doing what everyone expects just because
they expect it just feels...

549
00:28:53,392 --> 00:28:55,807
It feels...

550
00:28:57,548 --> 00:28:59,215
Like giving up.

551
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:03,574
I know what you mean.

552
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:05,726
You do ?

553
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:10,834
I'm engaged, Darcy.

554
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,466
I should have told
you earlier.

555
00:29:18,152 --> 00:29:21,218
It just doesn't
really seem real.

556
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:24,546
Do you...

557
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:26,835
do you love her ?

558
00:29:28,158 --> 00:29:29,752
I thought I did.

559
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,615
But now...

560
00:29:33,317 --> 00:29:34,362
Well,

561
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:38,333
all I know is that
her family wanted it to happen,

562
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:39,947
and... and then
that was that.

563
00:29:41,718 --> 00:29:43,392
It's crazy. She...

564
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,805
she hates boats.

565
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:48,510
She gets seasick
the second she steps on one.

566
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:52,488
And I would be just as happy
never to set foot on dry land again.

567
00:29:52,613 --> 00:29:55,156
Hell, I'd even get
married out here.

568
00:29:55,157 --> 00:29:58,157
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

569
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:07,265
Tucker, wait.

570
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:09,596
I mean...

571
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:11,178
we can't.

572
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:16,511
- Can we ?
- We have two hours until we dock.

573
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,717
Wow, we decided to get married
right then and there.

574
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,303
I told her I didn't come from money.
So without the Gibbs,

575
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:34,622
there'd be no more fancy dresses
or parties.

576
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,904
Didn't care. Said all she wanted
was me and the open sea.

577
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,331
Crazy as it was,

578
00:30:41,456 --> 00:30:44,860
at that moment we were clear
about what we wanted,

579
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:46,010
right then.

580
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:47,928
We wanted each other.

581
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,748
You together the rest of that night ?

582
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:54,989
No, no, she went down to change

583
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:58,978
into one of the dresses I bought her.
I told her to meet me on the bridge.

584
00:30:59,284 --> 00:31:01,409
But the captain was so excited.

585
00:31:01,534 --> 00:31:03,997
He said that he would open
the ballroom for us.

586
00:31:04,122 --> 00:31:05,940
I sent the head steward down
to tell her

587
00:31:05,941 --> 00:31:07,041
to meet me there instead.

588
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,782
Head steward. You talking about
Geoffrey Manning ?

589
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:12,569
I drove him crazy with
questions when he came back.

590
00:31:12,694 --> 00:31:14,996
What'd she say ?
What was she wearing ?

591
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,652
What'd he tell you ?

592
00:31:17,247 --> 00:31:19,375
He told me she was wearing
a red dress.

593
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,286
He called it
"a bold choice,"

594
00:31:22,738 --> 00:31:24,411
just like her.

595
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:28,985
I waited in the ballroom until
the sun came up, but she never showed.

596
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,634
I never saw her in it,
but to this day

597
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,657
I picture her
in that red dress.

598
00:31:36,003 --> 00:31:38,565
Beautiful as a sunrise at sea.

599
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,205
Where was she
when you found her ?

600
00:31:42,576 --> 00:31:46,020
The same place
as your last date, Romeo.

601
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,683
The engine room ?

602
00:31:47,808 --> 00:31:51,288
I can't let you sail off
into the sunset just yet, Captain.

603
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,760
Manning lied to us.
Knew exactly who "the Duke" was.

604
00:31:58,885 --> 00:32:02,889
Uptight SOB saw Darcy in the dress
she was wearing when she died.

605
00:32:03,873 --> 00:32:06,345
Tucker was getting ready
to break off his engagement with Millie.

606
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,904
embarrass the Gibbs family.

607
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:10,760
Wonder how far his loyalty went.

608
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:17,356
The night Darcy Curtis died...

609
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:20,079
you told us you didn't see her.
You wanna change that story ?

610
00:32:20,158 --> 00:32:22,792
Quiet a long time ago,
hard to recall.

611
00:32:22,846 --> 00:32:25,002
You don't remember stopping by
her room to check on her

612
00:32:25,037 --> 00:32:26,888
see what's she was wearing
for the wedding ?

613
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:31,029
Discretion, detective.
Afraid it's a part of job description.

614
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,948
Gibbs' clan was very forthcoming
with their family history, Manning.

615
00:32:34,989 --> 00:32:38,572
Your father was the family butler
since like always...

616
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:41,863
- Gentleman's gentleman.
- An his father before him.

617
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:44,595
I grew up on the Gibbs' estate.

618
00:32:44,647 --> 00:32:46,207
Lived in the same house with them.

619
00:32:46,307 --> 00:32:48,489
Job description included
making sur Tucker Benton

620
00:32:48,524 --> 00:32:50,443
didn't step out on line,
embarassed the family ?

621
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:52,265
Break Millie Gibbs' heart ?

622
00:32:54,692 --> 00:32:58,082
The Gibbs family never instructed me
to keep an eye on miter Benton.

623
00:32:58,126 --> 00:33:00,823
Not maybe in so many word, but
you expected to do it anyway.

624
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:04,134
Anticipate your masters needs
without haven't been told.

625
00:33:04,222 --> 00:33:06,028
That was a different time,
detective.

626
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,191
Tucker was about to run off
with some ??????

627
00:33:09,317 --> 00:33:12,488
- You have to step in.
- Damn right I stepped in.

628
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:15,090
I did what I had to do.

629
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:21,691
<i>"Drown in my own tears"

630
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,083
Geoffrey Manning, Miss.

631
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:28,353
Mind I have a word
regarding M. Benton ?

632
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,916
Is...

633
00:33:30,192 --> 00:33:32,310
is Tucker changed his mind ?

634
00:33:33,843 --> 00:33:36,197
Please, Miss Curtis.

635
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:41,644
You know, here on the ship,

636
00:33:41,744 --> 00:33:44,508
it's quiet commun to feel
that you're in your own world,

637
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:46,838
that anything is possible.

638
00:33:47,803 --> 00:33:49,455
And that's wrong ?

639
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,550
I fell how you feel

640
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:53,551
all too deeply,

641
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:56,750
behond my grasp...

642
00:33:57,482 --> 00:34:00,562
for a woman I have
no hope to attain.

643
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:02,935
In the end,

644
00:34:03,078 --> 00:34:04,991
I conceided,

645
00:34:05,185 --> 00:34:06,813
as you must,

646
00:34:06,895 --> 00:34:08,813
that it was not meant to be.

647
00:34:09,244 --> 00:34:10,980
Meaning you give up.

648
00:34:12,387 --> 00:34:14,961
Meaning I recognized
there are things more important

649
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,106
than my selfish desire.

650
00:34:17,945 --> 00:34:21,599
I put my feelings aside
and I did what was right.

651
00:34:21,716 --> 00:34:24,688
Well, this is right.
I know it is.

652
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:26,689
Life no fairytale, Miss Curtis.

653
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:28,951
Some point, you have
to give back the sleepers.

654
00:34:28,988 --> 00:34:31,197
It's different for us,
Mister Manning.

655
00:34:31,246 --> 00:34:33,253
- It's a different time.
- Listen to me...

656
00:34:33,336 --> 00:34:35,539
It only ends in pain for you,

657
00:34:35,729 --> 00:34:38,271
for Mister Benton and
for everyone involved.

658
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,130
Is that what you want ?

659
00:34:42,462 --> 00:34:45,441
M. Benton is prepare to shoot himself
in a foot over you.

660
00:34:45,488 --> 00:34:49,241
Please, think about what I said,
before he pulls the trigger.

661
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,394
I have long ago realised
that my love for her was an impossibility.

662
00:35:00,913 --> 00:35:02,337
Millie Gibbs.

663
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,040
You grew up together.

664
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:06,804
I couldn't bear
for her heart to be brocken.

665
00:35:07,571 --> 00:35:09,518
Even if she wasn't mine.

666
00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:13,956
I told Darcy the facts,
left the decision up to her.

667
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,366
Lot of crap.

668
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,366
You didn't trust her
to make the right decision,

669
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:18,967
so you drag her
to the engin room,

670
00:35:19,046 --> 00:35:20,445
and you make the floor.

671
00:35:20,605 --> 00:35:22,695
Far worse, detective.

672
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:25,840
I found her shoes on the deck
that morning.

673
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:28,382
- And I didn't report it.
- Hold on.

674
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:31,717
Captain's report said
that the master-at-arms

675
00:35:31,824 --> 00:35:34,055
found the shoes at 4h46 am.

676
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,745
He wasn't the first person
to found them.

677
00:35:37,908 --> 00:35:39,914
Is this the shoes you saw ?

678
00:35:40,091 --> 00:35:41,684
That's right.

679
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,630
About 3h30...

680
00:35:44,294 --> 00:35:47,901
- give it or take a fex minuts.
- So at 4h04...

681
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:50,800
Darcy was already dead.

682
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,498
You remember waking up the ship's
telegram operator

683
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:56,399
at 4h in the morning, Grace ?

684
00:35:56,929 --> 00:35:58,564
I would be asleep at that hour.

685
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:00,481
he remembers you clearly,

686
00:36:00,482 --> 00:36:02,982
waking up in the middle
of the night,

687
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,855
and forgot to tip him.

688
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:09,190
One lousy buck could have save you
lot of trouble, Grace.

689
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:11,504
Hey, you want to ask him
about it ?

690
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:16,020
- He's right here.
- No, stop, look, I know what you're doing.

691
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:18,810
I would never hurt Darcy.

692
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:24,730
- She was like family.
- She would have been

693
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,226
if she had married
Chester's cousin.

694
00:36:27,442 --> 00:36:31,564
Darcy and Henry were a good couple,
they would have been very happy.

695
00:36:32,382 --> 00:36:33,854
Like you and Chester ?

696
00:36:34,209 --> 00:36:36,426
85 Cumberland street.

697
00:36:36,686 --> 00:36:38,370
You know that adress ?

698
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,643
No.

699
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:44,707
???? with Chester name on it.
January 66.

700
00:36:44,742 --> 00:36:46,912
Now why would Chester had
a appartment

701
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,413
????

702
00:36:48,447 --> 00:36:51,180
You don't understand,
he didn't leave there.

703
00:36:51,215 --> 00:36:53,957
His mail forward,
dmv records.

704
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:56,121
Does Chester leave you, Grace ?

705
00:36:56,735 --> 00:36:59,402
Had he already left you
when you took that trip with Darcy ?

706
00:36:59,437 --> 00:37:01,529
No, no, no, no...

707
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:03,843
- We were working things out.
- Come on, Grace.

708
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:06,649
- It wasn't over.
- I spoke to his family.

709
00:37:06,782 --> 00:37:10,900
He was stepping out on you
pratically from your wedding night.

710
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,202
But you couldn't admit it.

711
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:18,184
Either way, why you still hanging
on that wedding photo.

712
00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:20,787
I didn't have her courage.

713
00:37:21,418 --> 00:37:23,974
And misery loves company, right ?

714
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:27,421
If Darcy had just married Henry,
like she was supposed to,

715
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:29,080
There would have been
another wedding.

716
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:32,481
Chester would have remember
what it was like to "be in love"

717
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,325
But Darcy wasn't going
to marry Henry, Grace.

718
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:37,088
Darcy grew wings.

719
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,283
And I was all alone.

720
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,917
But she didn't care what
other people thought anymore.

721
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:46,576
She was gonna take this situation
into her own hands,

722
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:48,877
and you didn't like that.

723
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:53,484
The steward found
Darcy's shoes at 3:30 AM.

724
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,076
Never say anything until today.

725
00:37:55,077 --> 00:37:58,077
This was send half a hour later.

726
00:37:58,248 --> 00:38:00,263
After Darcy was dead, Grace.

727
00:38:00,992 --> 00:38:04,120
Darcy's suicide note...
you wrote it.

728
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,479
You send it.

729
00:38:07,444 --> 00:38:09,578
Was it only
one reason to do that ?

730
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,570
I never meant to hurt her.

731
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:23,989
No, you didn't, Grace.

732
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,783
It's time to tell us what happen.

733
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:36,082
I followed her to the engin room.

734
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,686
I just wanted to confort her...

735
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:46,254
To tell her we could
work things out together.

736
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,076
But she didn't care.

737
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:57,082
Darcy, I'm sorry.

738
00:38:57,444 --> 00:39:00,476
Once we dock,
you'll forget all about that dandy.

739
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:03,654
You'll marry Henry,
You'll settle in,

740
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:07,052
and the four of us will have
so much fun together.

741
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:10,139
- Like we dream when we were kids.
- No, Grace...

742
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,977
He was right.

743
00:39:14,128 --> 00:39:16,519
The reason I came back her...

744
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:22,351
that really is the most beautiful
spot of the ship.

745
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:25,797
The fire in the belly.

746
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:30,117
What are you talking about ?

747
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,498
I'm gonna do it.

748
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:35,560
I'm gonna marry him.

749
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,394
- Righht now.
- Wait !

750
00:39:44,191 --> 00:39:47,594
- What about me ?
- Be my maid of honnor.

751
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:51,041
- Stay by my side.
- Darcy, I can't.

752
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:55,158
Yes, you can. I saw the way
you were looking at those dresses.

753
00:39:55,245 --> 00:39:57,311
Put one on and stand by me.

754
00:39:57,346 --> 00:39:59,895
But this is a fantasy.

755
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,174
That man is using you.

756
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:06,949
You belong at home,

757
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:11,217
with me, with Henry
and with Chester.

758
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,365
With Chester ?
Grace, do you hear yourself ?

759
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:16,366
We'll start planning
the wedding today.

760
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,451
And we'll go to Charles Garden
and we'll get you a dress.

761
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:25,072
- And Father Concane will talk to Henry.
- Chester left you !

762
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:29,919
What ?

763
00:40:31,009 --> 00:40:32,301
He's gone.

764
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:37,222
You don't have
to keep waiting for him.

765
00:40:39,566 --> 00:40:41,373
You have a choice.

766
00:40:44,749 --> 00:40:48,214
- Shut up.
- He's not coming back.

767
00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:52,205
Everyone konws it but you.

768
00:40:56,232 --> 00:40:57,872
How dare you...

769
