********

5
00:01:14,498 --> 00:01:16,100
How did a father not go back
inside

6
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,601
and get his own boys out ?

7
00:01:17,635 --> 00:01:18,602
I don't know.

8
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:21,037
A man would die to save his own.

9
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:40,357
Lil, it's Nick.

10
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:42,025
Yeah.

11
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,494
I broke down on. I'm, uh...

12
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:47,798
I'm on Conshohocken near Belmont.

13
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm pretty messed up.

14
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,703
Lil, I think I might
have killed somebody.

15
00:02:09,554 --> 00:02:12,021
Department vehicle
signed out by Detective Vera.

16
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:14,191
- Gone before I got here.
- Stop writing, will you ?

17
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:15,459
Sorry, Detective. Got to fill
out an accident report on all...

18
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,062
I said, stop...

19
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:18,563
writing.

20
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,166
Look, uh...

21
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,268
Do me a favor. Can you...

22
00:02:25,502 --> 00:02:27,270
just make it a car stop ?

23
00:02:27,304 --> 00:02:28,905
No accident ?

24
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:33,176
Right.
Sure.

25
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:34,511
Okay, go ahead.

26
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:36,179
I got it from here.

27
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:39,115
Thanks.

28
00:02:41,152 --> 00:02:42,453
Scotty...

29
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:44,154
it's me.

30
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:47,557
We got a problem.

31
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:57,595
Cod Case

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,660
Flashover

33
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:23,195
Damn, Nick.

34
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,697
Is there any blood ?

35
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,332
A little on the airbag.

36
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:29,367
Yeah, it looks like
he just hit the sign.

37
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:31,336
No animals down on the road.

38
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:32,771
You hear anything on the radio ?

39
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:33,939
Not yet.

40
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:35,540
What about that uniform ?

41
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:37,376
Nick was gone when he
arrived on the scene,

42
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,378
and I told him it's on me.

43
00:03:40,212 --> 00:03:41,813
But why ditch the car ?

44
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,682
Trying to duck a DUI ?

45
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:46,218
Message he left was a
whole lot worse than that.

46
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:49,121
You think he was serious ?

47
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:51,857
I called him back five times,
and he won't answer his cell.

48
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:55,827
I'll get it towed to my guy,

49
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:56,864
have him...

50
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:58,965
clean it up.

51
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,934
What the boss don't know can't hurt him, you know ?

52
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,169
He's got enough problems.

53
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:06,939
Well, at least till we figure out what
the hell's going on.

54
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:09,241
- Will or Kat know ?
- No.

55
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:10,676
Figured it's bad enough I got you

56
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,877
on the hook for this now, too.

57
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:14,546
It's Nick, Lil.

58
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,448
I mean, they'd want to know.

59
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,318
I'll have them swing by his place,

60
00:04:19,352 --> 00:04:21,487
see if he turns up.

61
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,493
The guy's a mess.

62
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:31,163
Yeah, he's been for a while now.

63
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,365
Schmitty's is up the road.

64
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,833
He's probably headed
home from the bar.

65
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:37,703
Big guy with a voice.
Right ?

66
00:04:38,537 --> 00:04:39,871
He in some kind of trouble ?

67
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:41,473
What kind of condition
was he in ?

68
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:43,709
Just so you know, I didn't
serve him more than three.

69
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:46,011
Guy tops it off in the parking lot,
that's on him.

70
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:47,512
Not trying to jam you up.

71
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:48,747
Just tell us when he left.

72
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:50,515
About an hour ago,
wits about him.

73
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,418
I'll cut off anybody,
cop or no cop.

74
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:53,452
Yeah. Yeah, we got that.

75
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:54,920
Sounds like he's become a regular.

76
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:57,823
Every night this week,
knocking back the Manhattans.

77
00:04:57,857 --> 00:04:59,358
He get into it with
anyone at the bar ?

78
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:00,661
Not tonight.

79
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:02,462
Keeps to himself,
regulars know he's a cop.

80
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:03,962
Wait. What do you mean,
not tonight ?

81
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:06,198
Last week, some idiot came in
here shooting his mouth off.

82
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:08,233
Me and Big Mac tossed him
before it got out of hand.

83
00:05:08,368 --> 00:05:09,601
This idiot got a name ?

84
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:10,836
What'd he look like ?

85
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,604
I don't know. Just some guy.

86
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,273
White, medium build,
maybe thirties.

87
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:15,474
What was it about ?

88
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:17,009
Not sure,

89
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:19,011
but the guy was sure
busted up about something.

90
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:21,947
You happy with yourself, detective ?
Thought you should know.

91
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:23,748
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I got it, buddy, okay ?

92
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:24,750
I tried to tell you,

93
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,552
but you wouldn't listen!
My brother's gone,

94
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:29,120
- and that's on you now.
- Know what, jackass ?

95
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:30,188
I told you to hit the bricks.

96
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:31,923
You're nothing but a drunk bum.

97
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,158
Mac, get him out of here.
How you can live with yourself ?

98
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:34,760
What does that mean ?
You need to calm down.

99
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:36,261
Come on ! Just relax, man.

100
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:37,896
Just calm down. Just relax.

101
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:39,899
I'm all right.

102
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,338
I don't know what
the guy's beef was.

103
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:47,573
Something about his brother.

104
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:50,976
He blamed Vera,
felt he wronged him somehow ?

105
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,112
Cop never bothered nobody,
so I gave the guy the boot.

106
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:54,947
- Nick ever here with anybody ?
- Nah.

107
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,248
Mostly just drinks alone.

108
00:05:56,582 --> 00:05:58,484
Last couple nights
in here looking over

109
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:00,052
some old file photos.

110
00:06:00,086 --> 00:06:02,588
Photos ? What, like,
crime scene photos ?

111
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:03,756
I don't know.

112
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,224
They were dark, hard to make out.

113
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:06,691
Like something burnt up.

114
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:09,061
Honestly, his line of work...

115
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:11,163
I didn't want to ask.

116
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:13,465
Key still works.

117
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,935
Clearly the maid don't.

118
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:18,971
God, just when you
think you know a guy.

119
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,073
Oscar needs a Felix.

120
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:25,844
Told me he passed his physical.

121
00:06:28,414 --> 00:06:30,415
Dude's a time bomb.

122
00:06:31,984 --> 00:06:33,852
It's worse than I thought.

123
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:35,921
- What was her name again ?
- Julie.

124
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:37,400
Split up years ago.

125
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:39,401
Booze and pills
definitely do not mix

126
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:41,102
with photos of the ex.

127
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:46,069
- What do you got ?
- It's a crime scene photo.

128
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:50,039
Something I saw Nick looking
at a few weeks back.

129
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,380
What the hell ?

130
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:00,683
Can't you see
I'm taking a table nap ?

131
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:01,951
Been a lot of those lately.

132
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:03,386
What do you got ?

133
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,822
Some other case.

134
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,026
Arson photo.

135
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,361
Didn't recognize it at the time.

136
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:15,064
J.D. Billingsley, 11/06.

137
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,067
But why bring home a
four-year-old arson case ?

138
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:20,336
Might have something to do
with the guy at the bar.

139
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,739
- You remember this case ?
- No.

140
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:24,941
But the fire marshal would.

141
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:26,211
Billingsley.

142
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,512
Oh, yeah, I remember.

143
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:31,714
Double homicide, arson,
couple years back.

144
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:32,882
You worked that with Nick, right ?

145
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,884
Yeah, that's right. What's going on ?

146
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:35,985
He contact you ?

147
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:37,487
Any reason the case might come up ?

148
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:39,155
No. Any reason it should ?

149
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:41,258
Tell us about the arson case, Ray.

150
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:43,292
Row house over in Kensington.

151
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,229
Incendiary, pretty open and shut.

152
00:07:46,263 --> 00:07:47,363
J.D. Billingey ?

153
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:48,798
Joe don billingsley.

154
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:51,701
Lit up his own place,
middle of the night.

155
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:52,969
It was a double homicide ?

156
00:07:53,003 --> 00:07:54,237
His own two boys.

157
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:58,042
Drunk bastard had
custody for the weekend.

158
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:04,080
Looks like a bomb went off.

159
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:05,581
Flashover.

160
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:08,684
Simultaneous ignition of
all combustible material.

161
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:09,919
Flashover.

162
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:14,423
Smoke and gas layer
got trapped at the ceiling.

163
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:18,861
At 1,100 degrees,
the whole room burst into flames.

164
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:21,730
Father said he was
asleep on the couch.

165
00:08:21,764 --> 00:08:22,865
Yeah, he also said

166
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:24,901
he couldn't get to the
kids' room down the hall.

167
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:26,803
Yeah, ran into a wall of flame.

168
00:08:26,837 --> 00:08:29,506
With no burns on his bare feet ?

169
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,274
Thought he ran out the front door.

170
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:34,310
Yeah, just let in more oxygen,
fed the beast.

171
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:36,479
Did you see the crazed
glass back there ?

172
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:37,847
Puddle configurations ?

173
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:39,615
Multiple points of origin.

174
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,884
Burn marks on the
baseboards and walls.

175
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,953
Yeah, all the way down the hall.

176
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:45,889
Seen hundreds of these.

177
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:47,691
Most of them do it
for the insurance.

178
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:50,693
- No. This place was a rental.
- Whatever.

179
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:52,229
Fire this hot don't
occur without the use

180
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:54,698
of an accelerant.

181
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:56,699
What, lighter fluid ?

182
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:59,902
Butane, propane, maybe gasoline.

183
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:01,771
Same result.

184
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:05,208
Got your pour patterns
on the floor right there.

185
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:09,011
Under the beds.

186
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:12,916
Son of a bitch burned
his own kids up.

187
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,484
Then ran out of the house.

188
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,323
Three and five, those boys.

189
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:22,325
That one just about
tore everybody up.

190
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:23,593
Including Nick ?

191
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:25,495
Nick was going through
a divorce at the time.

192
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:26,929
Rubbed him pretty raw.

193
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:30,399
Sick bastard killed his
kids just to spite his ex.

194
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:31,734
Nick put him away ?

195
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:33,002
Billingsley got life.

196
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:34,937
He's lucky he didn't
get the needle.

197
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:37,540
He didn't have the decency
to take his own life.

198
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:40,409
Any reason Nick would be
looking into that case again ?

199
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:41,910
Never said nothing to me.

200
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:44,747
You remember if this Joe Don had
a brother ? Maybe at the trial ?

201
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:46,215
I'm sorry, I don't.

202
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,550
Is everything okay ?

203
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:49,819
Well, you hear from him, ray,

204
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:51,521
let us know.

205
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,294
Joe don billingsley,
convicted in '08.

206
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:00,963
Arson, double homicide.

207
00:10:00,998 --> 00:10:02,332
Doing life up in rockford.

208
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:03,834
Was. Till he caught a shiv

209
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,235
last week in the yard.

210
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:07,336
Bled out. Old Joe Don's gone.

211
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:09,472
Could be the guy Nick meant,
got killed ?

212
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:11,340
A loudmouth at the bar blamed Nick

213
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,608
for his brother's death.

214
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:13,709
Younger brother, Travis.

215
00:10:13,744 --> 00:10:16,378
Popped twice for DUI,
resisting arrest.

216
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:18,314
Well, now he's stalking Nick.

217
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:20,282
He was fired from his
last job at Costco.

218
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,418
We're trying to track
down a new work address.

219
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:23,619
Travis.

220
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:25,955
Looks dumb enough
to go after a cop.

221
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,370
Morning, lieutenant.

222
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,573
Something wrong with
the air upstairs, Pat ?

223
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,676
You know where detective
Vera is, John ?

224
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,578
I guess I'm about to find out.

225
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:49,580
Don't jerk me around.

226
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:51,649
I know all about the
abandoned department vehicle

227
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,150
out on Conshohocken road.

228
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,652
- Okay.
- I also know

229
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,388
that one of your detectives
had it towed to a private garage.

230
00:10:57,722 --> 00:10:59,658
- One of my detectives ?
- Can't say I blame them.

231
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,460
Damaged vehicle,
reeking of kentucky sour mash.

232
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:03,561
Get to it, Pat.

233
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:05,296
That's a $35,000 vehicle

234
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,597
that belongs to the department.

235
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:07,832
And I would like to get it back

236
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,834
Before the commissioner
gets wind of this.

237
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:11,870
Good as new.

238
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,606
I'll get right on it.

239
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,409
As for detective Vera, I would
suggest you find out where he is

240
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,244
and just what the hell is going on

241
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,646
before the end of the working day.

242
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,515
Oh, I'll get to the bottom of it.

243
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:30,755
Put your house in order, John...

244
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,757
or I'll do it for you.

245
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:40,498
Travis Billingsley.

246
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:43,301
Detective Valens, Rush.

247
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:45,303
That supposed to impress me ?

248
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,805
Supposed to jog your memory.

249
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,573
Last time you saw
detective Nick Vera.

250
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,708
Why ? Something happened to him ?

251
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:51,910
Asked you a question, pal.

252
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,044
How you know detective vera?

253
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:54,879
Oh, so now I'm supposed
to help the police ?

254
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,716
How's that for an
impression, jackass?

255
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:00,851
In case you need my badge number.

256
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,520
This ain't a courtesy call, Travis.

257
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:05,056
You got into a bar fight with
detective vera last week.

258
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,057
That wasn't a fight.

259
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:09,126
Just tracked him down to
let him know what he did.

260
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,061
Yeah, what'd he do ?

261
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,196
He put my brother away,
got him killed.

262
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,598
Yeah, real sorry they
don't look kindly

263
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,566
on scumbags who burn up
their own kids in prison.

264
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,303
My brother wasn't a monster.
Joe Don didn't do it.

265
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,838
Right, buddy.
Nobody in jail did, right?

266
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,173
I had proof.

267
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:23,841
I tried for months
to get detective Vera

268
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,342
to take another look at the case,

269
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:26,544
but he wouldn't listen.

270
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,749
Detective, detective Vera,
can I talk to you ?

271
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:32,917
It's about my brother.

272
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,352
What's your name, buddy ?

273
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,920
Travis Billingsley.

274
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:37,588
Billingsley ?

275
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,691
Called five times about
my brother, Joe Don.

276
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,459
He's doing life up in Rockford
for arson.

277
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:45,129
- Yeah, 'course. I remember.
- I just need you

278
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:46,331
to hear me out
'cause the D.A. won't,

279
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,566
and that court-appointed lawyer
my brother had was a joke...

280
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,834
Well, it's a little late, pal.

281
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:51,035
He confessed.

282
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:52,337
That's not true. Yeah.

283
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,238
Check the trial transcripts.

284
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,042
He admitted he did it when he was
in lockup awaiting trial.

285
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,343
- Game over.
- That's just it, he didn't.

286
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,378
Check out the record on
that cellblock snitch.

287
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,882
Inmate the D.A. put on the stand
was a liar.

288
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,050
My brother would never
admit to setting that fire

289
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,318
'cause he didn't do it.

290
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:10,154
Everybody's innocent in the can.

291
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:11,891
But he never confessed to you,

292
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,292
did he, detective ?

293
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,395
Just asking you to take a look.

294
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:19,364
Yeah, sure.

295
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,266
I'll take a look.

296
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,067
<i>"Hey you" by Pink Floyd.</i>

297
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:27,205
He didn't give a rat's ass.

298
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:31,008
That cellblock snitch has given false
testimony before.

299
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,144
Cody Blanchard lied when
he said my brother confessed.

300
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,712
How do you know ?

301
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,913
'Cause he done it three times before.

302
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,281
That's how come they kept
letting him out.

303
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,050
So, he's a serial snitch.

304
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,284
That don't mean he lied.

305
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:42,319
Another guy he did it to got freed

306
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,189
after he recanted his testimony.

307
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,157
That the only reason
you tracked Nick down ?

308
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,725
Let him know that ?

309
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,394
Wouldn't you ?

310
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,230
Lying sob snitch sealed
my brother's fate,

311
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:54,966
and got rewarded for it.

312
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:58,737
And now it's too late.

313
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:02,740
Called Frackville.

314
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:04,442
Found out Nick went to visit

315
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,844
Billingsley's old cellblock
snitch a few days ago.

316
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:08,579
Already landed back in the can ?

317
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:10,014
Thieving drug fiend.

318
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:11,482
Old habits die hard.

319
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,351
Anybody here seen Nick ?

320
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,622
Not yet, boss.

321
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:19,723
Don't know.
He's got plenty of time.

322
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,159
Maybe he took a sick day.

323
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,027
So that's how we're
gonna play this, huh?

324
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,363
- What's that, boss ?
- Oh, cut the BS.

325
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,398
I know that Nick is missing,
along with his car.

326
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:29,700
This whole mess has
already blown upstairs.

327
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,369
As much you want to protect nick,

328
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,171
All of you might want to start
thinking about your own badges.

329
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:37,308
Look, we got no idea
where Nick went,

330
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:38,576
but we're on it.

331
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,711
All right, look.

332
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,880
Think it's got something
to do with a guy

333
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,615
Nick put away on an arson case

334
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,949
Four years ago.

335
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,017
Got killed in prison last week.

336
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,052
Billingsley.

337
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:50,287
What does this got to do
with Nick cracking up his car ?

338
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:52,056
Don't know, but it's the
last case he was working on.

339
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,324
That's it ?

340
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,862
Is there anything else I need
to get in front of here ?

341
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,567
Nick's in bad shape, boss.

342
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,969
Something I don't know, kat.

343
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:06,638
It's not physical, John.

344
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,507
His head's not right.
We're worried about him.

345
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,011
All right, talk to ada bell.

346
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,814
See what he knows about the
billingsley case. Rush and valens

347
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,116
Went to pay billingsley's
old cellmate a visit.

348
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,551
They're trying to track down
his ex,

349
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,052
see if he talked to her.

350
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,687
I'll reach out to
boyle over in feds,

351
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,522
See if we can get a location
on his cell phone.

352
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:26,791
- We'll find him, boss.
- We'd better...

353
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:28,859
before he does any more harm...

354
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:31,529
especially to himself.

355
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,566
Hey, julie.

356
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,001
What's going on ?

357
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:38,402
Is this about Nick ?

358
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,037
Have you seen him ?

359
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:42,039
He stopped by this morning.

360
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:43,841
He didn't look so good.
Is he okay ?

361
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,309
Just showed up at your door ?

362
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:46,510
Really kind of threw me.

363
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:48,512
I hadn't seen him
since the divorce,

364
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,648
and we never really
talked after that.

365
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:52,550
- What'd he want ?
- I don't know.

366
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,819
But it looked like he had
something on his mind.

367
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,554
I was trying to get my kids ready.

368
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:59,690
<i>"Mother" by Pink Floyd.</i>

369
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:01,325
Hey, jules.

370
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,228
Nick.

371
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,466
Thanks. If only I
had time to read it.

372
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,902
What are you doing here ?

373
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,238
I don't know. Uh...

374
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,007
Just felt like I needed to see you.

375
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:19,076
How've you been doing ?

376
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,912
You really should have called. I...

377
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:24,615
Is something wrong ?

378
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,317
No. Uh, sorry.

379
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:27,818
You're right.

380
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,120
I was just getting my
son ready for school.

381
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:33,224
Your son ?

382
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,394
I know you got remarried. I...

383
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:39,096
Clint. He just started preschool.

384
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,732
Clint. Wow.

385
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,333
I like that.

386
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:43,467
I also have a
two-year-old daughter.

387
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,569
That would be what you
hear yelling upstairs.

388
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,639
Mommy, I can't find
another shoelace.

389
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,075
Can you hold on one second ?
I'll be right back,

390
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,011
and we can talk for a minute.

391
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:59,683
Okay. Now you go find the other one,
and I'll find your jacket

392
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,119
and tell your sister
I'll be right there.

393
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:10,227
Never really had a chance to talk.

394
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,197
Figured it must be
important, but...

395
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,998
Didn't say where he was headed ?

396
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,500
Never got that far.

397
00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:18,469
It looked like he'd
been up all night,

398
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,237
Like he was working a case.

399
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:23,340
Is he okay ?

400
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:25,509
We don't know, but if
you hear from him again,

401
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:27,278
make sure to give us a call.

402
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,017
What up, Squirrel ?

403
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,652
Figure you got to watch
your back in here

404
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,087
with a nickname like that.

405
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:39,189
Yeah, yeah. Everybody's got
to watch their back in here.

406
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:40,925
St better at it than most.

407
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,093
Well, it helps to have
friends in the d.A.'s office.

408
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,462
Got the parole board

409
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,797
to cut you loose early
three different times.

410
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,133
Yeah. I'm just keeping
my eyes and my ears open.

411
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,868
Waiting for a nut
to fall from a tree.

412
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:52,737
Unfortunately,
that nasty meth habit

413
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,171
keeps landing you back in here.

414
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,439
Yeah, well, that's a...

415
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:57,608
That's just a temporary situation.

416
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,677
Now what can I do you for ?

417
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:03,380
Why did detective Vera
recently come to see you ?

418
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:06,450
Philly homicide, ain't you ?

419
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:08,686
You guys don't talk ?

420
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,688
Was it about the Billingsley case ?

421
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:11,722
Billingsley.

422
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,524
Man, that's ancient history.

423
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:14,959
Yeah. So was Joe Don.

424
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,994
Caught a shiv up in
rockford last week.

425
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:18,562
Yeah, I heard about
that from your partner.

426
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,165
Hard row to hoe for a baby
killer inside these walls.

427
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:24,068
So, what did detective Vera
want to know about Joe Don ?

428
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,003
Oh, man, I mean,
what is it with this case?

429
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,305
I already testified to the d.A.

430
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,274
Ain't the question we asked you.

431
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,245
Te-tell me again
what's in it for me.

432
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,080
We don't tell
the last homicidal maniac

433
00:18:37,114 --> 00:18:39,183
you flipped on it
was you who gave him up.

434
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:42,953
- What kind of cops are you ?
- The kind that don't care about you.

435
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,021
Detective Vera...

436
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:45,890
- why'd he come talk to you ?
- No disrespect, detective.

437
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,425
It don't have to be like this, okay ?

438
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,893
I tried to play ball with your guy,

439
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,828
but he just took it the wrong way.

440
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,065
You testified that Joe Don
told you he did it.

441
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,667
- Burned his house down.
- That's right.

442
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:59,003
That what I told the D.A.
Detective on the record.

443
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,605
While he was awaiting trial
in county lockup. Damn right.

444
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,207
He said that if he couldn't
have custody of them kids,

445
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:05,842
then that bitch couldn't, either.

446
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:07,411
And that's why he set
that house on fire.

447
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,413
Joe Don said this to you
even though

448
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:11,081
he never confessed to me
or anybody else ?

449
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:12,916
We were on the same cellblock,
detective.

450
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,052
Yeah, but he didn't
have a cellmate.

451
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:17,387
When exactly did he
tell you he did it ?

452
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:20,191
When I was walking by his cell.

453
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,592
What, through the food slot ?

454
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:22,926
Yeah, that's right.

455
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,663
He said he lit that
bitch up with gasoline.

456
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:31,635
He said because he wanted
custody of those kids, right ?

457
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:34,137
- That's what he said.
- Both of them ? The boy and the girl ?

458
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:36,440
Yeah, that's right, both of them.
A little girl, too.

459
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,280
Joe Don didn't have a little girl.

460
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,115
He just had two boys.

461
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,717
Look, man!

462
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:48,819
I just told that D.A. detective
what he wanted to hear,

463
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,287
just like I'm telling you.

464
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:52,656
What's that ?

465
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,758
What do you want me to say-
he did it ?

466
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:56,093
Then he did it.

467
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:57,694
Whatever you want me to say.

468
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,730
You just give me the right
information before I take the stand,

469
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:01,966
And I'll say it right.
Don't you worry.

470
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,870
A man is dead because
of your lying ass.

471
00:20:07,004 --> 00:20:08,439
Because of me ?

472
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:11,074
I thought it was you
who put him in here.

473
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,479
I don't get it. I played the game.

474
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:17,781
I fed you and the D.A.
what you need and...

475
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,383
This is the thanks I get ?

476
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:22,019
- Yeah, the thanks.
- Well, that cop had a screw loose, no ?

477
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:22,987
The truth is, Joe Don didn't say

478
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:26,023
any of that B.S. to you about
offing his kids, right ?

479
00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:28,592
Difference does it make ?

480
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:30,327
I mean, if he didn't do that,

481
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,562
then he did something else.
Right ?

482
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,565
I mean, we all did it in here.

483
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,866
The difference is,

484
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,367
he's dead, Squirrel.

485
00:20:38,402 --> 00:20:39,903
Yeah, well, I wasn't glad to hear

486
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:42,939
that Joe Don got stuck, but
that man was twisted.

487
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:44,074
Oh, yeah.

488
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:45,409
And he was in denial, too.

489
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:46,543
What are you talking about ?

490
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,546
Oh, he would cry himself
to sleep every night.

491
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,082
Just crying about them kids.

492
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,250
Yeah, then he would write

493
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:56,253
letters to some crackpot scientist.

494
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:58,489
What scientist ? How do you know ?

495
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,324
A little C.O. bird told me.

496
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:01,992
He's working on his appeal.

497
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,827
You know, thought he
could get him out.

498
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,729
What's a name worth to you ?

499
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:09,733
Worth keeping your acorns
out of a vice, Squirrel.

500
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:14,571
This is Joe Don
Billingsley's old house.

501
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,908
Fbi tracks Nick's phone
to this location.

502
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,510
Yeah.
Why would he come back here ?

503
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,413
Who you calling ?

504
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:24,215
Nick.

505
00:21:40,431 --> 00:21:41,764
It's his.

506
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,272
Last call an hour ago to me.

507
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:49,506
Home phone.

508
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,210
Why wouldn't he just call
your cell? I don't know.

509
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:56,080
<i>You have one current message.</i>

510
00:21:56,814 --> 00:21:58,181
Left a voicemail.

511
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,550
<i>Hey, man, uh, it's Nick.</i>

512
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,320
<i>I just wanted to tell you,
uh, it's been</i>

513
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,888
<i>Great working with you.</i>

514
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:06,891
<i>You've always been a-a...
a good friend to me.</i>

515
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:10,327
<i>I think I still owe you 50 bucks.</i>

516
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:11,931
<i>Anyways, um...</i>

517
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:13,732
<i>that's about it.</i>

518
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:15,999
<i>Sorry about the whole mess.</i>

519
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:23,627
Hey, boss.

520
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:26,464
Next time you two get
the instinct to protect me,

521
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:27,665
don't.

522
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:30,133
Where are we on Nick ?

523
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:32,202
Running down a list of calls,
messages...

524
00:22:32,236 --> 00:22:34,437
Anyone talked to Nick
in the past 24.

525
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:36,306
There was a recent call on his cell

526
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,442
to Jeanette Peterson,
Billingsley's ex-wife.

527
00:22:39,477 --> 00:22:40,910
Miller and Jeffries are headed over

528
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:42,012
to talk to her now.

529
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:43,947
Also, calls to a Goran Petrovic,

530
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:45,181
a professor over at Temple.

531
00:22:45,216 --> 00:22:47,150
One yesterday and one last week.

532
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:49,319
Correspondence records at rockford

533
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:51,154
Show billingsley wrote
multiple letters

534
00:22:51,188 --> 00:22:53,623
- to the same dr. Petrovic.
- What kind of professor ?

535
00:22:53,658 --> 00:22:54,924
Chemical engineering.

536
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,359
Also worked for multiple

537
00:22:56,394 --> 00:22:59,696
companies that served
private military suppliers.

538
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,331
Hit the campus.
Pay the doc a visit.

539
00:23:01,365 --> 00:23:02,499
You talk to criminal intelligence ?

540
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:03,800
Oh, yeah, we got teams

541
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,735
of plainclothes cops
trying to track him down.

542
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,337
All right,
tell them no paper trail.

543
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:08,571
I just said find him,

544
00:23:08,606 --> 00:23:10,006
Bring him in, no questions asked.

545
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,908
Yeah, don't take "no"
for an answer from Nick.

546
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:14,010
And, scotty,
get that damn car back.

547
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,418
Used to design
all sorts of nasty explosives

548
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:24,721
with military applications.

549
00:23:24,755 --> 00:23:26,222
Lucrative, yes.

550
00:23:26,257 --> 00:23:28,191
But also insane.

551
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:30,694
- I prefer teaching.
- Detective vera

552
00:23:30,728 --> 00:23:32,896
asked you to review the
J.D. Billingsley case ?

553
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,230
Given that he was

554
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:35,665
The original investigator

555
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,034
and seemed quite desperate,
yes, I took a look.

556
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:40,670
Well, the fire marshal
determined that it was arson.

557
00:23:40,705 --> 00:23:42,906
Which frankly, I found stunning...

558
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,007
though I shouldn't anymore.

559
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,875
- Why's that ?
- Most fire marshals

560
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,712
only have high school degree,
and certified

561
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:51,548
after one 40-hour course
in fire investigation.

562
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:53,982
Ray crawford's been on the job
30 years.

563
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:55,783
He's done
hundreds of arson cases.

564
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:58,722
Instincts and experience
is no substitute

565
00:23:58,756 --> 00:24:00,423
For scientific method.

566
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:03,026
And this finding
completely ignores it.

567
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,461
What did you tell detective Vera ?

568
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:06,096
I told him the truth.

569
00:24:06,964 --> 00:24:08,698
From the photos,
it appears that the fire

570
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,867
reached upwards of 1,800 degrees.

571
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:12,936
Flashover from the accelerant.

572
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:13,937
Not necessarily.

573
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:15,772
The temperature is affected
mostly by ventilation.

574
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,041
But what about the burn patterns

575
00:24:18,675 --> 00:24:20,643
and the... The puddle
configurations under the bed ?

576
00:24:20,678 --> 00:24:22,213
The effects of flashover

577
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:23,714
can look like evidence of arson,

578
00:24:23,748 --> 00:24:26,216
But these burn patterns
aren't indicative

579
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,484
Of an accelerant.

580
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:29,953
So how did the fire start ?

581
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:31,654
That's hard to tell.

582
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:32,589
From these pictures,

583
00:24:32,623 --> 00:24:34,524
tt appears that the point of origin

584
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,426
Was most likely the kitchen.

585
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:40,029
But you can't say for sure
what caused it ?

586
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:41,331
Not for certain.

587
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:43,333
Which why I'm baffled by
the fire marshal's

588
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:44,334
finding.

589
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:45,935
Oh, crawford's been
at it a long time.

590
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,136
He learned from the old timers.

591
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:49,005
Might explain why
it's based on, uh,

592
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,040
junk science and old wives' tales.

593
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,209
Yeah, but Joe Don, he escaped
with no burns on his feet.

594
00:24:53,244 --> 00:24:54,411
How's that possible ?

595
00:24:54,478 --> 00:24:56,246
Because fire burns upward.

596
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,181
And one that reaches flashover

597
00:24:58,215 --> 00:25:00,082
is the next hottest thing to hell.

598
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:02,519
And unless you're confronted
with that type of heat,

599
00:25:02,553 --> 00:25:04,854
You just can't understand it,
detective.

600
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:07,357
You're right. I don't.

601
00:25:07,391 --> 00:25:08,992
He left his kids inside.

602
00:25:09,026 --> 00:25:10,293
As soon as he went outside

603
00:25:10,327 --> 00:25:13,163
to find another way in,
he just let in more oxygen.

604
00:25:14,197 --> 00:25:15,631
Fed the beast.

605
00:25:15,866 --> 00:25:20,103
Even a fireman wouldn't go back
into this blast furnace.

606
00:25:21,972 --> 00:25:23,873
So what you're saying is,

607
00:25:23,908 --> 00:25:26,509
It's possible Joe Don was
telling me the truth ?

608
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:29,612
I see no evidence of arson.

609
00:25:31,816 --> 00:25:33,850
That's good. Right ?

610
00:25:34,518 --> 00:25:36,686
If he wasn't already dead.

611
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,791
Seemed to take the
news pretty hard.

612
00:25:41,828 --> 00:25:43,795
You think the fire
start in the kitchen.

613
00:25:43,796 --> 00:25:46,696
Older house like that,
nine times out of ten,

614
00:25:46,729 --> 00:25:48,131
it's faulty wiring.

615
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:50,500
Yeah, but there's no
way to tell for sure.

616
00:25:50,534 --> 00:25:52,602
Usually, there'd be
some prior issues

617
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,371
With overloaded circuits,
browning outlets.

618
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:58,074
But you'd have to ask somebody
who lived in the home.

619
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,642
Joe don getting killed,

620
00:25:59,677 --> 00:26:02,879
all these detectives
coming round here again...

621
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:05,448
It's like the nightmare never ends.

622
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:07,116
Detective vera came by here ?

623
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:08,351
Yesterday.

624
00:26:08,385 --> 00:26:09,719
Asking me all those questions

625
00:26:09,753 --> 00:26:11,521
about things I'd rather not relive.

626
00:26:11,555 --> 00:26:13,190
Going over your statement.

627
00:26:13,224 --> 00:26:16,493
I didn't care to,
but I trust detective Vera.

628
00:26:17,627 --> 00:26:20,230
Joe Don was pretty upset
when I moved out.

629
00:26:20,764 --> 00:26:22,098
He lost his job.

630
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:23,799
Drinking too much.

631
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,069
He just...

632
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,970
he wasn't the same man I married.

633
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,004
I filed for separation and...

634
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,075
then he...

635
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:32,876
he found out I was dating.

636
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,577
He threaten you or the kids ?

637
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:37,747
He said some pretty...
Terrible things.

638
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,351
But, um...

639
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:47,489
I couldn't deny the boys
their father.

640
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:49,125
You know, when they told me that

641
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:51,327
He set the house on fire,

642
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:53,463
I couldn't believe it.

643
00:26:53,497 --> 00:26:55,231
You know...

644
00:26:56,834 --> 00:27:00,470
nobody should experience
a loss like that.

645
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,540
Jeanette, did detective Vera

646
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:05,775
Ask you anything else
about the house ?

647
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:08,046
He kept asking about

648
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:10,347
when I live in the house.

649
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,981
About the kitchen.

650
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,985
He said he'd never let
another man raise his boys.

651
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,421
I lost everything.

652
00:27:18,455 --> 00:27:21,591
Jeanette, I need to ask you
about the time before you left

653
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:22,959
When you still lived in the house.

654
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:24,861
Do you remember any
electrical problems

655
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:26,129
With the lights or the outlets?

656
00:27:26,163 --> 00:27:28,164
What problems didn't
the house have ?

657
00:27:28,198 --> 00:27:30,700
Lights were always
flickering on and off.

658
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:31,701
Did you tell your landlord ?

659
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,770
Cheap bastard never fixed anything.

660
00:27:33,804 --> 00:27:35,004
Do you remember any problems

661
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,406
with the wiring in the kitchen ?

662
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,774
The switches or the outlets ?

663
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:40,010
Why are you asking me this ?

664
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:41,844
He's dead, my kids are gone.

665
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:43,513
It's important.

666
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:44,414
Why ?

667
00:27:48,018 --> 00:27:50,252
I don't know how to say this,
but...

668
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:53,556
it's possible Joe Don
didn't set that fire.

669
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,161
You must be joking.

670
00:27:59,196 --> 00:28:01,297
You're the one who
told me he did it.

671
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,833
The police, the fire department,

672
00:28:03,867 --> 00:28:05,568
The lawyers... it has to be true !

673
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:07,737
I'm not so sure anymore.

674
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,138
Well, I don't have any doubt,
detective.

675
00:28:09,173 --> 00:28:11,040
You tell me how a man

676
00:28:11,075 --> 00:28:14,477
doesn't run back in there
to save his own sons.

677
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:17,313
The neighbors,
they saw him on the street

678
00:28:17,348 --> 00:28:19,282
while my babies burned up.

679
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:21,417
How could he not go back in there ?

680
00:28:21,452 --> 00:28:22,719
Tell me that !

681
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:26,856
Those were your kids,
would you stand outside

682
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,158
while they burned alive ?

683
00:28:29,193 --> 00:28:32,362
Jeanette, what was wrong
with the wiring in the house ?

684
00:28:32,696 --> 00:28:35,031
You know, every time you'd
plug in the toaster,

685
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:36,265
The fridge would go out.

686
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,934
In the kitchen ?

687
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:40,903
One time the outlet melted down.

688
00:28:41,037 --> 00:28:42,471
I lost a bunch of breast milk.

689
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,273
Joe don finally called an electrician,

690
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:46,508
and the landlord got all upset
about it.

691
00:28:46,543 --> 00:28:47,576
The landlord ?

692
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:48,878
Bela.

693
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:50,980
He only wanted to use his handyman

694
00:28:51,015 --> 00:28:52,415
to fix everything on the cheap.

695
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:54,017
Look, I-I don't understand

696
00:28:54,051 --> 00:28:56,019
Why you keep asking
me about the house.

697
00:28:56,053 --> 00:28:57,553
Should talk to insurance company.

698
00:28:57,588 --> 00:28:59,422
I'm still trying to
get them to pay up.

699
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,590
Oh, that's got to be rough
on you, Bela.

700
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:05,194
Yeah, I should not have
rented to that family.

701
00:29:05,228 --> 00:29:06,596
Now, that man was alcoholic.

702
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,900
It's always bad
when man of house

703
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:10,401
cannot hold on to job.

704
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:12,702
Understand that house had a
lot of electrical issues.

705
00:29:12,736 --> 00:29:14,737
Issues? No issues.

706
00:29:14,772 --> 00:29:17,373
You cannot put blame on
me for what happened.

707
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:19,008
Oh, we didn't say that, Bela.

708
00:29:19,043 --> 00:29:21,110
Maybe we should talk
to your handyman.

709
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:24,013
Why you detectives keep
harassing me ?

710
00:29:24,447 --> 00:29:25,615
So what happened

711
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:27,817
when Joe Don hired
his own electrician ?

712
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,686
Oh, that stupid waste of money.

713
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,788
You know how much electrician
charges per hour ?

714
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:33,556
Yeah, sounded like you needed one.

715
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,759
Joe don was problem tenant.

716
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:39,696
Always overloading circuits,
clogging up pipes,

717
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,198
asking for more time
before paying rent.

718
00:29:42,232 --> 00:29:43,868
- Always !
- No, the way we heard it,

719
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:45,669
your handyman couldn't fix
anything.

720
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,170
There's old wiring,
lights flickering,

721
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,538
Browning outlets, and you send over

722
00:29:49,572 --> 00:29:51,040
A guy who can't screw
in a lightbulb.

723
00:29:51,074 --> 00:29:52,508
That's ridiculous.

724
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:54,177
Jorge is very good handyman.

725
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,311
I know him personally.

726
00:29:55,345 --> 00:29:58,314
Joe Don's ex told us a
kitchen outlet melted.

727
00:29:58,348 --> 00:29:59,348
He told them just

728
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,651
"plug it into the bottom."
That your idea ?

729
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,691
I am not negligent.

730
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,527
I have lawyers who can prove this.

731
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:12,828
Sure you do.

732
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:16,265
Look, I manage three
apartment buildings.

733
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,601
People always want
something for nothing.

734
00:30:18,635 --> 00:30:20,837
Never mind if it's a fire hazard.

735
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:23,306
I did not start that fire.

736
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:28,010
This is not my fault.

737
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:29,946
Oh, yeah, it's...

738
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,981
It's nobody's fault.

739
00:30:33,283 --> 00:30:34,484
Hey, call just came in.

740
00:30:34,818 --> 00:30:36,718
Got a jumper at 12th and Ridge.

741
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:39,422
It's two blocks up
from Nick's place.

742
00:30:54,738 --> 00:30:56,239
White male, 40s, heavyset.

743
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:58,040
- No id ?
- Nada.

744
00:30:58,075 --> 00:31:00,076
Face is messed up
from the swan dive.

745
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,544
Six stories up.

746
00:31:01,578 --> 00:31:03,679
Lil.

747
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,524
That ain't him.

748
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:20,166
It's good you got that
department vehicle

749
00:31:20,301 --> 00:31:22,102
back in serviceable condition.

750
00:31:22,136 --> 00:31:23,903
Any such luck with your detective?

751
00:31:24,238 --> 00:31:25,505
No.

752
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:28,308
Hey, that's too bad.

753
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:30,510
Do what you've got to do.

754
00:31:35,816 --> 00:31:37,050
You know, John,

755
00:31:37,884 --> 00:31:39,486
I know you think I hate you.

756
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,588
That I'm after you because of what
you did to my son 15 years ago.

757
00:31:42,622 --> 00:31:45,693
- Pat...
- No, let me finish.

758
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:49,262
I know Matt was a screw up.

759
00:31:49,296 --> 00:31:51,664
Wife and I, we tried
everything: rehab,

760
00:31:51,699 --> 00:31:54,534
kicked him out of the house,
more rehab-- none of it worked.

761
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:56,669
Now, this is none of my business.

762
00:31:56,704 --> 00:31:58,605
No, it was everybody's business-
that was the problem.

763
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:00,239
Everybody in this whole

764
00:32:00,274 --> 00:32:01,007
damn department knew
that he was my son.

765
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:02,575
So every time he got arrested,

766
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,811
he got a pass-- skated by,
and Matt knew it.

767
00:32:04,845 --> 00:32:07,380
He counted on it.

768
00:32:07,415 --> 00:32:08,982
Till you finally locked him up.

769
00:32:08,983 --> 00:32:09,983
I don't need to hear this.

770
00:32:10,017 --> 00:32:11,484
- No, you do.
- I had to, Pat!

771
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,186
It was his fourth time!

772
00:32:14,922 --> 00:32:18,158
It took my kid a long time to
get straightened out, John.

773
00:32:18,492 --> 00:32:21,995
Getting a job is
tough with a record.

774
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:23,296
But, finally, he did it.

775
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,465
He even got married.

776
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:30,170
Last month...

777
00:32:30,204 --> 00:32:33,306
He actually gave me a grandson.

778
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,309
I heard.

779
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:38,311
- Congratulations.
- Which is right about

780
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:40,547
when I finally admitted to myself

781
00:32:41,381 --> 00:32:42,649
that getting locked up

782
00:32:42,684 --> 00:32:45,251
was the best thing
that ever happened to my son.

783
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:49,722
Which, I guess,
is my roundabout way of saying

784
00:32:50,356 --> 00:32:51,791
you were right.

785
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:54,494
So, I'm going to return the favor.

786
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,963
- Pat, it was a long time ago.
- When or if

787
00:32:56,997 --> 00:32:59,599
you get your detective back,

788
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:01,968
I expect you to do the same.

789
00:33:04,271 --> 00:33:06,039
- Nick...
- Take him off line.

790
00:33:06,073 --> 00:33:07,407
Send him to psych services.

791
00:33:07,441 --> 00:33:10,143
If that doesn't work,
take away his badge.

792
00:33:11,412 --> 00:33:12,545
Take care of it, John.

793
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,547
I realize now it's the only way.

794
00:33:19,453 --> 00:33:20,887
Yeah, okay, thanks.

795
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:22,689
That was the fire station.
Said Nick was just there

796
00:33:22,723 --> 00:33:24,691
15 minutes ago.
Got into it with Crawford.

797
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:26,159
- Fight ?
- Said it got pretty heated

798
00:33:26,193 --> 00:33:28,161
until some firemen jumped
in and Nick took off.

799
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:29,662
All right, call Lil and Scotty.

800
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:31,031
See if they can catch up to him.

801
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:33,132
The balls on that
guy coming in here,

802
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,301
going at me how I do my job!

803
00:33:35,336 --> 00:33:36,636
Who the hell's he think he is ?

804
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,771
- Calm down, Ray.
- Don't tell me to calm down !

805
00:33:38,806 --> 00:33:42,007
How would you like it some fireman
marches into the PPD,

806
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:44,110
saying you messed up a case ?

807
00:33:44,144 --> 00:33:45,879
He came at you about Billingsley ?

808
00:33:45,913 --> 00:33:48,281
Whatever! Son of a bitch!

809
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:50,550
This about half hour ago?
He on foot?

810
00:33:50,584 --> 00:33:53,052
Hell if I know. Couple of the
guys tossed him out on his ear.

811
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:55,154
He's lucky I didn't break his jaw!

812
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:57,190
Yeah, all right, all right.
Just tell us what happened.

813
00:33:57,224 --> 00:34:00,093
I've been a fire marshal
before he was a beat cop.

814
00:34:00,127 --> 00:34:03,196
Don't tell me what's
arson and what ain't.

815
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:06,297
Take a look at the file, Ray.

816
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:08,112
There were electrical
problems in the house.

817
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:09,913
No residue of a
petroleum-based accelerant.

818
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,480
You're out of your freaking mind.

819
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,641
Just take a look at
the file, please.

820
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:14,650
Heard about enough.

821
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:15,885
Get the hell out of here.

822
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,113
- I don't think he did it, Ray.
- I don't really care what you think.

823
00:34:19,137 --> 00:34:20,595
I know it's arson,

824
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,892
just like you know a
murder when you see it.

825
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:25,036
He never gave it up !
That never bothered you ?

826
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,337
What are you talking about ?

827
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:28,397
48 hours in the box,
I never got him to give it up.

828
00:34:28,522 --> 00:34:30,065
I always maintained his innocence.

829
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,900
- That don't bother you ?
- No, that's between him and God.

830
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:35,571
I went on what you told me, Ray.

831
00:34:35,696 --> 00:34:38,307
- That it had to be arson.
- What are you saying, that I'm wrong, Nick ?

832
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,661
- That this is all on me ?
- No, no, I'm not saying that.

833
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,993
Don't forget, you took
the witness statements.

834
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:46,140
You testified on the stand
to his state of mind.

835
00:34:46,265 --> 00:34:46,896
Ain't denying that.

836
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:48,572
The guy was a drunk !

837
00:34:48,697 --> 00:34:50,247
He's a terrible husband !

838
00:34:50,372 --> 00:34:52,488
Pissed off at his wife,
at the world.

839
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:54,523
Been there
all those things, myself.

840
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:56,225
It doesn't mean that
he killed his kids.

841
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,193
Oh, cry me a river.

842
00:34:58,218 --> 00:35:00,262
Joe Don Billingsley didn't
deserve what happened !

843
00:35:00,387 --> 00:35:03,522
- He didn't deserve to die !
- Boo-hoo! Live with it.

844
00:35:04,209 --> 00:35:05,768
We gotta make this right somehow.

845
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:07,203
There is nothing to fix.

846
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,813
Guy's dead and gone.

847
00:35:09,518 --> 00:35:12,999
His ex-wife still thinks
that he killed her kids.

848
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:15,679
His own parents think that
he killed their grandkids !

849
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,780
Guess what ?

850
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,047
So do I.

851
00:35:18,172 --> 00:35:20,173
And that's the way it's gonna stay.

852
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:22,751
You do what you got to do !

853
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,120
I know what I got to do !

854
00:35:24,145 --> 00:35:25,581
I know what I got to do !

855
00:35:26,146 --> 00:35:28,991
Nobody comes in here and
talks to me like that.

856
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,556
He said something about
Joe Don's parents.

857
00:35:31,557 --> 00:35:32,257
Making it right ?

858
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:35,327
I don't know what he's going to do,
and frankly, I don't care.

859
00:35:36,777 --> 00:35:39,671
So why wouldn't you look
at the evidence again, Ray ?

860
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:44,112
You seriously entertaining
reopening this case ?

861
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,849
Get the hell out of my house.

862
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:08,076
Nick !

863
00:36:08,077 --> 00:36:09,177
Get in.

864
00:36:22,169 --> 00:36:24,200
Joe Don's parent'' house, huh ?

865
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:26,949
Been out here what ?

866
00:36:27,074 --> 00:36:28,560
An hour ?

867
00:36:31,311 --> 00:36:33,446
Just trying to figure
out what to say.

868
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:38,570
You had a busy 48 hours.

869
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,302
You had us all worried.

870
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,522
Have I been fired yet?

871
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:45,591
Maybe the boss can
pull some strings.

872
00:36:46,493 --> 00:36:47,503
For both of us.

873
00:36:47,876 --> 00:36:48,753
You ?

874
00:36:48,878 --> 00:36:51,353
Considering I covered up a DUI.

875
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:55,449
Sorry about that.

876
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,333
You're a good cop, Nick...

877
00:37:01,075 --> 00:37:02,826
but you need help.

878
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,329
I saw my my ex-wife Julie.

879
00:37:07,904 --> 00:37:09,786
She's got two kids.

880
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:13,195
I always thought that that'd be me.

881
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,898
No, it's never too late.

882
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:19,228
I'm happy for her.

883
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:22,705
Back when they caught this case,

884
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,662
it's all I wanted was a kid,
a family.

885
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,539
And then when I saw that
burnt-out bedroom...

886
00:37:30,371 --> 00:37:31,714
And the kids...

887
00:37:32,536 --> 00:37:33,341
Yeah.

888
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:37,557
Yeah, I sat down on the box
across from this man,

889
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:40,686
this father that had...
had burned his kids alive,

890
00:37:40,781 --> 00:37:43,548
and I couldn't believe
someone could do that.

891
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:47,606
Did he ?

892
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,446
I went at him day and night, Lil.

893
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,072
I knew something
wasn't right in my gut.

894
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,282
I kept looking for that
one thing in his story,

895
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:58,139
that one slip that just lets you...

896
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,553
...lets you know he's a liar.

897
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,944
Just needed one slip.

898
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:04,847
But he never did.

899
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:08,150
I didn't need a statement
to get a conviction. I had everything.

900
00:38:08,275 --> 00:38:09,852
I was just so sure he'd done it.

901
00:38:09,877 --> 00:38:12,144
And you weren't the only one, Nick.

902
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:20,903
Firemen call it the "beast."

903
00:38:22,878 --> 00:38:24,392
Flashover.

904
00:38:25,196 --> 00:38:27,302
It only got hotter
when he went outside,

905
00:38:27,427 --> 00:38:30,555
trying to find another
way back to get his kids.

906
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,993
- But he couldn't.
- I just couldn't get my head around that.

907
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:37,003
What that was like ?
I thought for sure he'd set that fire,

908
00:38:37,658 --> 00:38:39,716
and he tried to tell me,

909
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,417
and I couldn't hear it.

910
00:38:41,728 --> 00:38:42,948
He tried to tell you what ?

911
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:44,953
That he wasn't a killer.

912
00:38:45,078 --> 00:38:46,614
He was just afraid.

913
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,930
Afraid for his own life.

914
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:49,433
And for that,

915
00:38:49,734 --> 00:38:51,334
I couldn't forgive him.

916
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,396
It was you, Joe Don.

917
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,124
You started that fire,

918
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,599
you burned up those kids.

919
00:38:57,724 --> 00:39:00,002
No, I could never do that.

920
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:02,321
I would never hurt them.
I loved my boys.

921
00:39:02,346 --> 00:39:04,697
Really ? Then how could you just
leave them in there to die ?

922
00:39:06,212 --> 00:39:09,244
I just... The fire,
it was everywhere.

923
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:11,964
It was so hot. You have no idea.

924
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:13,215
You're right, I don't.

925
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,303
You had plenty of time to go
in there and get them out.

926
00:39:15,428 --> 00:39:17,832
No, I thought I could, but...

927
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,533
it happened so fast and...

928
00:39:21,014 --> 00:39:23,485
And then I was on fire.

929
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,374
<i>The fire, it was,
it was everywhere.</i>

930
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:31,222
And the heat, my God...

931
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,463
Help me believe you.

932
00:39:33,464 --> 00:39:35,264
How did a father not go back
inside

933
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,581
and get his own boys out ?!

934
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:38,831
- I don't know.
- You see, a man,

935
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,376
a man would do anything
to save his own.

936
00:39:42,444 --> 00:39:43,671
I tried.

937
00:39:48,894 --> 00:39:52,345
I really tried...

938
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:55,114
I don't believe you.

939
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:56,043
You're a liar.

940
00:39:56,168 --> 00:39:57,483
You're a damn liar.

941
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,847
How could you just stand by
and let that happen?!

942
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:02,020
Help me understand that.

943
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:06,904
- How ?!
- I don't know, all right ?

944
00:40:07,557 --> 00:40:08,859
I just...

945
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,865
couldn't.

946
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,354
I don't know.

947
00:40:15,355 --> 00:40:19,355

948
00:40:21,308 --> 00:40:24,076
I mistook cowardice for guilt.

949
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,645
It's an honest mistake, Nick.

950
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:28,791
One that can't be made right.

951
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,300
Well, look, we'll talk to the DA.

952
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,144
We'll try to clear his name.

953
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,022
Okay ?

954
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:48,313
First, I gotta do this.

955
00:41:07,389 --> 00:41:09,321
Mr. and Mrs. Billingsley,
I'm Detective Vera.

956
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,697
I know who you are.

957
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,293
I'm sorry for your loss.

958
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:15,789
What do you want ?

959
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:20,128
There's been some new
evidence in the case,

960
00:41:20,253 --> 00:41:22,444
and I know it will never
bring your son back,

961
00:41:23,003 --> 00:41:25,471
but I want you to know I'm going
to do everything I can to clear his name.

971
