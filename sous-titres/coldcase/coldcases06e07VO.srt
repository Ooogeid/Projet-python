Houston,uh,Tranquility Base here.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,790
The Eagle has landed.

("bad moon rising "by
creedence clearwate )

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,040
You just missed the moon
landing,you little troglodyte.

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,880
Get out of here,Laura!

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,180
Don't have a spaz.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,470
I don't care about your
stupid toy,Danny boy.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,430
It's not a toy.Get out!

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,970
Why don't you get out?

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,920
You haven't left the
house in three days.

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,790
Mom!Laura's bothering me!

16
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,310
Mom sent me.

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,090
Personally,I could care less if you
stay a friendless goober your whole life.

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,020
Hello?Earth to Danny...

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,900
Wow,he's leaving the house!Hold
on.Let me get a picture.

20
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,990
Detective McAvoy,Lilly Rush.

21
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,490
A retired detective.Just Mack,now.

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,040
Well,you said you got
something for me to look at?

23
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,040
Yeah,couple days ago guy comes
into the Fairmount Station.

24
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,460
- Drops this off.
- Some kind of model rocket?

25
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,680
Yeah,he found it up near the
bluffs over the Wissahickon.

26
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,860
Some,uh,civilian desk jockey processed it and
didn't even bother ID'ing the guy who brought it in.

27
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,760
Yeah,civilian humps doing cops' work.

28
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,100
Yeah,take a look here.

29
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,170
"The Chestnut Hill Rocket
Boys launched this vehicle

30
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,820
July 20,1969 AD in peace for all
mankind." Signed "Danny Finch."

31
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:45,150
Day after we landed on the moon,Danny
Finch's body turns up in the Schuylkill.

32
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,780
He was 12 years old.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,420
That was my first year in Homicide.

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,190
Tough way to start out.

35
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,680
Yeah,tough on the family.

36
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,450
- Any suspects?
- Scumbag Reggie Blunt.

37
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,620
He got popped for a laundry list of
murders around the city that year.

38
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,670
And the DA lumped my
kid's case in with them.

39
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,900
Never got a conviction,but everybody
was sure he did it.Except me.

40
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,650
Talk to Danny's friends back in the day?

41
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,700
No,he didn't have any.

42
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,740
Boy was a loner,you
know,science nerd type.

43
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,500
Blunt went down for the other murders and
brass said there was no more meat on the bones.

44
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,590
He pushed me to move on.

45
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,030
This gives you something to chew on.

46
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:23,520
Yeah,this rocket was in the park two miles
upstream from where the body was found.

47
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,890
I interviewed all the
kids in the neighborhood.

48
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,620
I got nothing.

49
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:33,110
But this makes me think that maybe
he did have some friends after all.

50
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,130
- These "rocket boys."
- I don't know,Mack.

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,410
A toy rocket's a tough
sell with the bosses.

52
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,230
I've been 39 years turning over in my
sleep what could have happened to this kid.

53
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,040
You have any idea what
that does to you,Detective?

54
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,170
No one else around here
will give me the time of day.

55
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,040
And I hear you take
cases nobody else will.

56
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:58,860
You find this kid's murder,maybe
I can get to sleep again.

57
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,560
Rocket Boys,huh?

58
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,920
Yeah,you think I'm crazy,huh?

59
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,310
I don't think you're crazy,Mack.

Custom-machined,high-grade
chrome nickel washer.

65
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,670
A 12-year-old
kid built this?

66
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,530
Get it to Evidence,see if they can
lift any prints inside the cylinder.

67
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,680
Pretty skimpy box on this kid.You sure
your boyfriend did all his homework?

68
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,640
Blunt gets credit for the murder,suddenly
Mack's strong-armed to move on.

69
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,310
Blunt gets shanked in Graterford in '78.

70
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,850
He knew anything about
it,he took it to his grave.

71
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,630
Old Crackpot Mack.

72
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,290
Oh,you knew him,boss?

73
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,720
He was in Homicide when I was
still walking a beat in Fishtown.

74
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,180
He's a good cop.

75
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,120
Bosses thought he
cared a little too much.

76
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,650
Autopsy report's got Danny with abrasions on the
face and body,a cracked skull,blunt-force trauma.

77
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,940
Kid got banged up pretty bad.

78
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,050
Aw,Chestnut Hill Chemistry Award,1968.

79
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,570
I didn't even know they
had chemistry in 6th grade.

80
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,600
Danny's sister Laura
is in with Jeffries now.

81
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,710
See if she knows anything
about this rocket.

82
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,230
Or the Chestnut Hill Rocket Boys.

83
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,810
Can I smoke in here?

84
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,880
Uh,no.-

85
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,300
Sorry. I thought police
station,you know,maybe.

86
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,010
Not unless you're
planning on confessing.

87
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,600
I lost my baby brother the
day they put a man on the moon.

88
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,480
I still can't look at it
without thinking about him.

89
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,690
You two were close?

90
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,850
I was pretty awful to him,actually.

91
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,780
It breaks my heart now.

92
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,860
At that age,you just don't think.

93
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,590
Danny say where he was going that day?

94
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,010
He never told me anything.

95
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,750
He sort of holed up in the science.

96
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,770
Skipped a grade when he was eight,ended
up in my class.Drove me crazy.

97
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,830
We found this up in the park.

98
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,420
Danny's name on it.

99
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,930
Know anything about it?

100
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,980
Math,science,chemistry.He was more
about equations than this sort of thing.

101
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,580
What about a "Chestnut
Hill Rocket Boys" club?

102
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,020
Danny in a club?

103
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,610
No way.But...

104
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:43,400
the week before he died,I saw him
with some boys from the neighborhood.

105
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,490
Right...right here.

106
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,340
All right,perfect.

107
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,640
Okay.Perfect.

108
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,910
Neil Armstrong readies the
launch vehicle for ignition.

109
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,530
How come you always get to be Neil?

110
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,510
Huh,Chuck?

111
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
'Cause I'm the commander.

112
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,530
You can be Buzz Aldrin,the
mission specialist.

113
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,320
Okay,she's set to fly,Captain.

114
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,290
Saved every cherry bomb I
could find from 4th of July.

115
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,870
Rocket's loaded and ready for liftoff!

116
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,530
Loaded and ready.This
baby's going to the moon!

117
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,120
I hope you know it's not going to work.

118
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,480
Go play with your Bunsen
burner,Poindexter.Busy here.

119
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,460
Look,you can't just pack
it full of explosives.

120
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,220
You have to cut the powder
with sulfur,otherwise...

121
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,760
Kid,we need your help,we'll ask for it.

122
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,320
Got it?

123
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,670
All right,men.Let's light this candle.

124
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,150
Let me do it,Chuck.

125
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,790
Here we go!

126
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,590
Ten,nine,eight,seven,six,five,four...

127
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,950
Told you so.

128
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,500
That stunt caused a lot of trouble.

129
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,070
Chuck's dad about skinned him alive.

130
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,650
Remember their names?

131
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,620
Just Chuck Pierce,the cute one.

132
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,920
But those three,they were
always together,though.

133
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,600
Ever see them with your brother again?

134
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,300
Chuck came by the next day.

135
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,770
Asked to see Danny.

136
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,460
I remember being disappointed.I
thought he was there to see me.

137
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,040
Civvie who took in the
rocket's a real paperweight.

138
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,110
Oh,let me guess: less than helpful.

139
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,550
Like pulling teeth.

140
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,730
I finally got him to rember
what time the guy brought it in.

141
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,430
I went back and dug through
the catch desk sign-in sheets.

142
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,170
Came up with a name: Mike Collins.

143
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,650
Great,got to be what,800 of
them in the Philly phone book?

144
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,700
Yeah.Go,Irish.

145
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,990
Your boyfriend called again.

146
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,700
Mack asked if we want
him in on interviews.

147
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,920
Told him,"Thanks.We're good.

148
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,130
" You going to share your
desk with this guy,Lil?

149
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,580
Aw,he was a good cop.

150
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,570
Tough to walk away when
you got business to settle.

151
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,360
I'm still sweating cases after I get my gold
watch,do me a favor,put me out of my misery.

152
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,770
Count on it.

153
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,460
Crackpot Mack said Chuck Pierce used to run
with some boys: Seth Rundgren and Bobby Kent.

154
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,090
All three of them interviewed in '69.

155
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,090
Said they were watching
the moon landing together.

156
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,340
Doesn't look like Chuck
let go of the rocket thing.

157
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,780
Naval aviator,applied
for NASA in the '90s.

158
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,460
Private air captain now.

159
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,440
Lear jets of the rich and famous.

160
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,760
Poor man's Neil Armstrong,this guy.

161
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,770
Let's see what Neil Armstrong
has to say about the Rocket Boys.

162
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,760
Yeah,it was a real shock
when Danny turned up dead.

163
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,530
Block was never the same again.

164
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,040
Yeah,how so?

165
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,700
Predator on the streets.

166
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,400
Parents wouldn't let kids play
outside after dark anymore.

167
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,500
Only now,thinking Danny might have
been with friends the night he died.

168
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,150
You friends with Danny back then,Chuck?

169
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,880
Friends?Not really.

170
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,580
No,Danny was kind of
a...kind of an odd duck.

171
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,960
On the night of the moon
landing,did you see him around?

172
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,190
No,I was at home watching it on TV.

173
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,970
Pinnacle of human achievement.

174
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,390
You with anyone?

175
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,720
Yeah,I was,I was with,uh,Seth
Rundgren and Bobby Kent.

176
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,720
Haven't seen those guys in years.

177
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,840
- They lived on my block.
- The Chestnut Hill Rocket Boys,right?

178
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,820
Yeah,well,rockets were a phase,I mean,probably
because of the moon landing and all.

179
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,100
I think we were into
sharks the next week.

180
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:21,420
Then,uh,why'd you stop by Danny's the day
after you and your posse blew the neighborhood

181
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,390
to China trying to launch a rocket?

182
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,770
Ah,well,we wanted to see what he knew.

183
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,250
I mean,a rocket without a brain to
guide it is pretty much just a pipe bomb.

184
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,930
He help you out?

185
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,990
Oh,yeah,sure,he'd do
anything,anything to be our friend.

186
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,670
We,we were just out to have
a good time,but this kid...

187
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,210
this kid was obsessed.

188
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,000
Once we're in,we got to move fast.

189
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,280
The foreman,Mr.Wallace,hates kids.

190
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,000
Heard he killed a guy on his site once.

191
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,450
They say he buried the body in the yard.

192
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,330
Never found it.

193
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,640
We have to make the nozzle out of something
that'll hold up to the heat from takeoff,

194
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,330
launch the vehicle all the
way into the mesosphere.

195
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,540
Geek.

196
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,570
You don't shut it,I'm gonna
launch you in the mesosphere.

197
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,250
We're supposed to be sneaking in,nimrods.Wallace
is going to hear us a mile away.

198
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,670
This is it.

199
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,290
Up and over,men.

200
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,360
Uh,guys?

201
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,920
I'm really not so great
at climbing fences.

202
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,740
Ah,gee,there's a surprise.

203
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,990
There,we need tt piece.

204
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,120
The one that's shaped like a
cone right on top-- it's perfect.

205
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,860
Come here!

206
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,740
Hey,you little bastards!

207
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,640
- Go,go,go!
- Get the hell off this property.

208
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,270
You think you're going to steal from me?

209
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,200
bite it,dirtbag.

210
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,280
You runt.

211
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,150
Show your face in here
again,you'll see what happens,man.

212
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,780
Come on! Come on!

213
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,560
That guy was a damn menace.

214
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,010
Everybody knew it,but like I
said,that kid Danny-- he was obsessed.

215
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,410
You saying he went back?

216
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,130
He told us that...everything we need to
launch a rocket was inside that fence.

217
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,230
When was this?

218
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,290
Oh,I don't know,maybe a
week before the moon landing.

219
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,950
NEIL ARMSTRONG That's one
small step for man,one...

220
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,590
giant leap for mankind.

221
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,860
Night,Lil.

222
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,760
You find anything on
the rest of Chuck's crew?

223
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,560
Well,Seth Rundgren
has a colorful history.

224
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,040
A court-ordered lockup '86 to '90.

225
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,040
Schizo-affective disorder.

226
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,980
Bobby Kent's a floor manager at
Zane's Sporting Goods in Germantown.

227
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,580
What about this Wallace character?

228
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,470
Picked up an assault and battery in '68 for slapping
around a junkie trying to steal copper from his site.

229
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,160
Put the guy in ICU for three weeks.

230
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,760
You get something off that rocket,Nick?

231
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,830
Rocket science,people.

232
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,240
Well,the factory that machine-tooled the metal cone
Danny used as a nozzle was located right here in Philly.

233
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,980
DWC Custom Manufacturing.

234
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:16,310
Place was knocked down,the summer of '68,and guess who's
on the books as site foreman for the demolition company.

235
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,840
Dick Wallace.

236
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,100
Meaner than a junkyard dog.

237
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,210
Best demo company on
the Eastern seaboard.

238
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,490
Ain't a building they put up
I can't pull down on a dime.

239
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:44,020
'69,though,you were just starting
to make a name for yourself.

240
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,540
I paid my dues.

241
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,070
Took any job that'd have
me.Demo,drywall,construction.

242
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,740
Site watchdog.

243
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,310
Yeah,I was the ogre.

244
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,110
Somebody had to be.Rob
you blind,otherwise.

245
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,490
Like that junkie you
busted open back in '68.

246
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,010
Freak pulled a knife on me.

247
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,910
What am I supposed to do?Bleed on him?

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,450
Sure,I get it.

249
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,750
Sometimes you got to crack
a few skulls,get things done.

250
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,390
Yeah,you said it.

251
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,750
What about Danny Finch?

252
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,630
Kids tried to sneak on your
lot,you make a few threats.

253
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,570
Week later,this boy
turns up beaten to death.

254
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,340
Danny thought he could
outsmart you,sneak back in.

255
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,200
It's not like you didn't warn him.

256
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,020
Yeah,I warned him all
right,not that it did any good.

257
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,260
You got to be some kind
of special nitwit,right?

258
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,310
It's almost $14.

259
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,060
It's all I got.

260
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,960
W
- We just need maybe 200 grams of potassium nitrate.

261
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,020
Forget it.

262
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,060
Seriously,kid,amscray.

263
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,120
Look,I'm sorry we broke
in,but my friends--

264
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,730
they're counting on me.

265
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,860
I'm like Wernher von Braun to them.

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,390
Wernher von Braun.

267
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,620
The scientist who
created the space program.

268
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,660
Without him...

269
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,210
without me that rocket will never fly.

270
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,490
I've been up all night working
out the mix,trying to get it right.

271
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,240
If I do,maybe they'll see that I'm...

272
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,880
That you're what?

273
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,640
Nothing.

274
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,790
Probably hopeless anyway.

275
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,510
The calculations never come out right.

276
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,150
It's going to explode or fly off course.

277
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,560
I'm gonna regret this.

278
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,490
Should be about the right mix.

279
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,700
Need an emulsifier to bind the powder.

280
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,800
The right nozzle,it should
burn clean instead of a...

281
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,700
fast explosion.Know what I mean?

282
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,030
Hey,kid.

283
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,670
Calculations'll only get
you so far in life.Right?

284
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:59,250
At some point,you got to get
outside,you got to make it work.

285
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,460
Wow,this is perfect.

286
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,060
- Yeah,the scrap metal's...
- Yeah,I know.

287
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,020
Saw the perfect part for the
nozzle when we were here before.

288
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,650
Well,take what you need,all right?

289
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,820
Just don't be bringing
your little hood pals back.

290
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,180
Hey,kid.

291
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,340
You blow yourself up,you leave
my name the hell out of it.

292
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,510
You dig?

293
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,700
All right,now beat it.

294
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,600
You gave a 12-year-old
kid dynamite?

295
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,730
It was a different time.

296
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,330
No lawsuits,no helmets,no safety seats.

297
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,000
We let kids be kids.

298
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,030
So...Danny,he...

299
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,610
managed to launch that rocket,huh?

300
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,860
Looks like it.

301
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,230
That's good.

302
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,380
Good for him.

303
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,710
Seth Rundgren?

304
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,950
Detectives Rush,Vera.

305
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,620
Need a hand?

306
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,590
- No,thanks.
- Few questions about Danny Finch.

307
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,650
Danny Finch.

308
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,670
Mind if we come inside,talk about it?

309
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:28,030
The last time I saw Danny,he wanted
us to break into a construction site.

310
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,750
We heard.

311
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,500
We climbed a fence and,and a man came out
with a baseball bat and chased us away.

312
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,090
Right.What about after that?

313
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,440
The day of the moon
landing.You see Danny that day?

314
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,680
Please don't touch that.

315
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,950
Whoops.

316
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,930
Seth.The day of the moon landing.

317
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,520
The-There was no moon landing.

318
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,170
Come again?

319
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,000
It's the pinnacle of human
achievement,and it was a hoax.

320
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,630
Th-They shot the whole
thing on a,on a soundstage.

321
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,280
- Who's "they"?
- NASA,the CIA,LBJ.

322
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,610
Lyndon Johnson faked the moon landing?

323
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,380
I've talked to agents who were there.

324
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:17,070
They tell me things,th-th-the tr--
the truth about what happened that day.

325
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,580
Danny think the same way?

326
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,610
He said it was the
scientists whmade it happen.

327
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,560
Without them,the Eagle
never would have landed.

328
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,530
Seth,the broadcast about the Eagle
landing happened the day Danny died.

329
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,430
If he said that,it means
you saw him that day.

330
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,490
Three of you were with him
when he launched the rocket.

331
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,710
The Chestnut Hill Rocket Boys.

332
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,080
I know what you're trying to do.

333
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,610
Y
- You're trying to get me to say that I,I see Danny.

334
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,030
But he's gone.

335
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,480
I
- I know that.

336
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,140
But you still see him sometimes?

337
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,640
They say it's the disease.

338
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,300
It,it,it makes me believe
things that aren't true.

339
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,940
- Who's "they"?
- Chuck and Bobby?

340
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,860
Seth,you talk to them lately?

341
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,760
Your friends when you were 12.

342
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,780
How many of them do you still talk to?

343
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,840
Guy gives new meaning to
the word "certifiable."

344
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,300
Keep pushing,we'll never get
a straight story out of him.

345
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,770
Just lock up under pressure.

346
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,490
Stick a tail on him,see
what he does,where he goes.

347
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,910
Believe his rap about not
talking to Bobby and Chuck?

348
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,660
Not for a second.

349
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,280
I did steal his phone bill off his desk.

350
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,750
Lot of calls to one number.

351
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,730
Bet it ain't the CIA.

352
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,670
I got a few minutes before
I'm back on the floor.

353
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,350
Say you're looking for some
contact info for Seth Rundgren?

354
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,390
Yeah,know any way we
can get a hold of him?

355
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,060
I wish I could help,but...I
haven't talked to him in,gosh,ages.

356
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,880
Go ahead.Pick it up.We'll wait.

357
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,760
Hello.

358
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,750
What up,liar?

359
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,940
Got your number off of
Seth's phone records.

360
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,620
He's been calling you 20 times
a week for the past month.

361
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,660
You sure you haven't
talked to him in ages?

362
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,910
You can hang up now,Bobby.

363
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,800
The three of you were with
Danny the night he died.

364
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,010
- Seth already told us.
- Question is: why is he calling you so much?

365
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,680
And why are you both lying about it?

366
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,100
Look,Seth has a pretty
weird imagination.

367
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,990
One way of putting it.

368
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,400
Something go down with
Seth and Danny that night?

369
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,860
No.

370
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,450
Oh,come on,Bobby.

371
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,410
- Unstable guy...
- Maybe not even his fault,right?

372
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,680
Out in the woods,a dare gone bad.

373
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,480
Guess we got to take you
downtown,sort this all out.

374
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,520
Okay,okay,all right.

375
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,300
It isn't about Seth.

376
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,200
Seth and Chuck are lying to protect me.

377
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,140
This is outstanding.

378
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,170
Nice job,Danny.

379
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,570
Yeah.

380
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,190
Nice job.

381
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,660
Bobby,why do you say everything
Chuck says right after he says it?

382
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,180
I don't.

383
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,020
Actually,you kind of do.

384
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,430
Shut up,dork.What do you know?

385
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,120
Hey,ease off.

386
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,870
He's the reason we're out here.

387
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,160
Ought to be at home watching this on TV.

388
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,680
You kidding?

389
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,930
- This is way better.
- We're living it,man.

390
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,660
Right,Danny?

391
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,850
Yeah,this is the best.

392
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,140
Never really been in the woods before.

393
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,530
We're explorers.

394
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,020
Conquerors.

395
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,660
I'm Neil Armstrong,commander of the...

396
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,250
What was that?

397
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,110
There's something in the woods.

398
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,020
My half-brother,Malcolm,and
his dirtbag buddy,Griff...

399
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,040
they used to beat our
ass every chance they got.

400
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,730
You left Danny behind with them?

401
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,150
- Nothing we could have done...
- And when Danny turns up dead?

402
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,360
They killed Danny-- what do you
think they would have done to me?

403
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,320
Where are your parents in all this?

404
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,510
Dad split,and Mowas
working all the time.

405
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,580
She left Malcolm in charge of me.

406
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,540
Best thing that ever happened was the two of them
shipping off to Vietnam the second they turned 18.

407
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,250
Griff died over there.

408
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,120
Malcolm came back even worse.

409
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,790
And where is he now?

410
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,280
Up at Graterford,doing ten
to 20 for armed robbery.

411
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,800
So,now Brother Bobby's trying to
pin a murder on me-- that's swell.

412
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,810
It sounds like you got it coming.

413
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,290
Made his life hell.

414
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,020
Life is hell.

415
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,510
Better he learned that early on.

416
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:59,840
Nice record you got,Malcolm: armed
robbery,assault,killing animals.

417
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,620
Not a big leap to doing in a kid.

418
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,670
You made your minds
up.Pull the trigger already.

419
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,480
Says here you got a shot
at parole in seven months.

420
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,490
Number might come down or go up,depending
how interesting you make our time here.

421
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,100
This is a simple question.

422
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,230
See Danny that day or not?

423
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,170
Yeah,we saw him.

424
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,880
Kid was about to wet his shorts.

425
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,670
- You like that sound,maggot?
- Let me go.

426
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,710
Should have learned to
run faster,professor.

427
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,330
Might have lived a little longer.

428
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,800
Hey,what have we got here?

429
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,190
Man,that is one big-ass firecracker.

430
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,410
Fuse and everything.

431
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,840
What are you gonna do with this,dork?

432
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:41,290
Let's light it under his twerp ass,see
how many pieces it makes of him.

433
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,550
Leave it alone.It's ours!

434
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,080
"Leave it alone!" Or what,wuss?

435
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,760
Light it up,Griff.

436
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,750
Broke my nose!

437
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,660
Kill him.

438
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,450
What?The rocket's mine,numb-nuts.

439
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,750
Wait up.

440
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,190
Deviated my septum,little bastard.

441
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,960
You hear that?Still
whistles when I breathe.

442
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,320
Got your asses kicked
by a couple 12-year-olds?

443
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,190
Seth wanted that rocket real bad.

444
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,400
He was crazy enough
to take us on for it.

445
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,280
Hey,I was honest with y.That's
got to be worth something,right?

446
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,320
Right.We'll get back to you,Malcolm.

447
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,880
No,you won't.

448
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,110
I been in here long enough.I
ain't stupid,but hey...

449
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,830
Tell Bobby his big brother
says hello,would you?

450
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,280
Uh,took you long enough.

451
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,710
Thank you.

452
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,280
Never much into housekeeping.

453
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,760
Those intervie that you took from
the boys in the neighborhood...

454
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,470
still got them?

455
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,760
I got everything.

456
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,120
So,where do you want to start?

457
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,930
Seth Rundgren,Bobby
Kent,and Chuck Pierce.

458
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,780
You ever have a case like this?

459
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,500
You know,one that sticks
with you,doesn't let you rest?

460
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,670
Yeah,I...I do.

461
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,710
Name's Cooper.

462
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,140
And the kicker is he's still out there.

463
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,170
Unsolicited advice?

464
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,580
Don't let it sit for 30 years.

465
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,800
Starts eating away at
you.Trust me on that.

466
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:02,980
Their stories are exactly the same,across the board
- "pinnacle of human achievement. "

467
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,620
Still doing it today.Chuck says it.

468
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,820
Seth's got the same lines,word for word.

469
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,660
Like The Manchurian Candidate.

470
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,050
Danny gets killed here in the
park and dumped in the Wissahickon.

471
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,450
Then floats all the
way down to the river.

472
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,060
Some of the injuries could have
come from the beating he took,

473
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,400
but the marks on his legs and arms...

474
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,290
maybe postmortem,bumping
off the rocks as he drifted?

475
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,070
Well,it was a rainy summer.

476
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,310
Creek was swollen.Would
have only taken a few hours.

477
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,030
Now,that spot could be right where
our Michael Collins found the rocket.

478
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,520
- Michael Collins?
- The guy who brought in the rocket.

479
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,420
Probably a fake name.

480
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:40,610
Michael Collins was the third
astronaut on the Apollo 11 mission.

481
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,480
Third astronaut?

482
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,850
Armstrong and Aldr landed on the
moon,put their footsteps down,

483
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,640
became heroes,and Michael Collins...

484
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,250
he stayed in orbit around
the moon and never landed.

485
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,330
The boys were playing astronauts.If Chuck
was Armstrong,and Bobby was Aldrin...

486
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,850
Seth was Michael Collins.

487
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,490
Michael Collins.

488
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,960
You...you followed me.

489
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,480
You found the rocket here?

490
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,040
No,not,not...not here.

491
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,310
Up the path by the ravine.

492
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,670
You ought it in 'cause you wanted
us to reopen Danny's case.Why?

493
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,860
I don't want to...to see it anymore.

494
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,510
I...I want it to stop.

495
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,080
What do you want to stop,Seth?

496
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,100
What I remember.It can't be real.

497
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,950
What wasn't real?The
moon landing,the launch?

498
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,850
No,our...our launch was...was real.

499
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,170
You chickens through running away?

500
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,290
Oh,you made it back.

501
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,170
You got away.

502
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,910
- Holy crap.
- How did you do it?

503
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,160
Danny punched Malcolm
right in the honker.

504
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,340
Nah,it was all Seth.

505
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,620
I'd be dead if he didn't come back.

506
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,020
We're all dead anyways.

507
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,850
Malcolm will never let this go.

508
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,330
Forget it.

509
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,050
He can kill us tomorrow.

510
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,890
Right now...

511
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,050
we got a rocket to launch.

512
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,060
Yeah.

513
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,540
Let's do it.

514
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,230
- This is right here.
- Yeah Great.This is it.

515
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,150
Engraved it,so whoever
finds it knows who we are.

516
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,310
the rocket boys

517
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,670
We're now switching to mission control
as Neil Armstrong exits the spacecraft.

518
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,340
Hey,guys,listen.

519
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,560
They're walking on the moon.

520
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,590
That's one small step for
man,one giant leap for mankind.

521
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,560
They did it.

522
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,930
You light it,Seth.

523
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:07,750

Ten,nine,eight,seven,six,five,four,three,two,one!

524
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,820
What happened then,after the launch?

525
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,440
What happened out here?

526
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,830
We had to jump.

527
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,790
It was only way to get home
before our parents caught us.

528
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,370
Chuck and Bobby told me he...he didn't
make it,but I know that's not true.

529
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,930
Because I saw him.

530
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,990
I think you're gonna
have to come with me.

531
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,810
How long you been at him?

532
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,890
Hour or so.Guy's all over the place.

533
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,560
Still think he knows who did it?

534
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,650
I don't know.

535
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,970
A whole lot more than just
phone calls between these three.

536
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,660
Chuck and Bobby have been paying
Seth's way the last 20 years.

537
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,740
A lot of money.

538
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,350
Got Chuck's name on receipts
for clozapine,Loxitane.

539
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,090
Heavy meds.

540
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,870
They're doing everything
they can to keep him quiet.

541
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,500
Boss!

542
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,320
Get the medics!

543
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,920
This is Rush in Homicide.

544
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,260
Get a medic unit in here now.

545
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,820
Pronounced him at the ER at Roxborough.

546
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,720
Guy was a mess.I shouldn't
have left him alone.

547
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,940
Yeah,well,nothing you
could have done,Nick.

548
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,770
Something happened at that creek.

549
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,260
And Seth would rather die
than tell us what it is.

550
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,660
Your friend's on the slab,Bobby.

551
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,870
- Seth?
- Killed himself right over the table you're leaning on.

552
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,460
Died keeping your secret.

553
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:03,050
Almost like you killed him yourself.

554
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,010
Poor guy.

555
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,450
- Never really had a chance.
- Friends like you...

556
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,200
I guess not.

557
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,480
Don't seem very surprised,Chuck.

558
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,240
We did everything we could to help him.

559
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,580
Why is that?

560
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,080
Goodness of your heart?

561
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,330
We were practically
brothers,the three of us.

562
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,050
We couldn't let him down.

563
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,680
That's what everybody
did his whole life.

564
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,900
- You tried to help him.
- That's right.

565
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,900
Just little things.Making
sure he was okay.

566
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,620
Little things.Like the 14,000
bucks for his mental hospital?

567
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,660
Ten years' worth of antipsychotic meds?

568
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,700
- That wasn't me.
- What happened at the creek,Bobby?

569
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,700
Seth said Danny made the
jump; Chuck said he didn't.

570
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,310
What's Chuck paying
all that money to hide?

571
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,090
All right,so I...I paid
a few of Seth's bills.

572
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,500
It's only because he couldn't
afford to do it.Bobby,either.

573
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,950
You were keeping him quiet.

574
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,480
No,I was helping him cope.

575
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,620
With your secret.Tearing him
up inside for the past 39 years.

576
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,090
The jump,Chuck.Tell us
what happened at the jump.

577
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,940
Chuck bent over backwards to help Seth.

578
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,260
That's the kind of
guy he is.End of story.

579
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,500
I got nothing else to say.

580
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,280
Little memento for you.

581
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,000
Sit here with your dead friends
and think about w they got that way.

582
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,900
Chuck's not gonna break
unless we got him cold.

583
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,670
Bobby's so deep in his thrall,it's
like getting him to rat out Jesus.

584
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,340
Hero worship.

585
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,510
Chuck's throwing money at the
problem,but Bobby's doing all the work.

586
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,090
'Cause Bobby actually cares.

587
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,020
I got this.

588
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,720
Get up.

589
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,220
I gotta cuff you before
I take you to your cell.

590
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,220
Wait...what?

591
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,390
Chuck tossed you uererhe bus.

592
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,610
You're locked up for murder.

593
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,070
Chuck wouldn't...

594
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,830
- He wouldn't do that.
- Well,he did.

595
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,190
And he's gonna get away with it because
you're too spineless to do the right thing.

596
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,760
Get up.

597
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,530
I didn't do anything.

598
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,920
I didn't do anything!

599
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,490
Save it!Bedtime story for your cellmate.

600
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,510
Wait,Chuck said I did something?

601
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,310
- Why would he do that?
- I don't get it.

602
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,080
You follow the guy around like a sheep.

603
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,110
- I'm not a sheep.
- Baaa,baaa,baaa.

604
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,810
That's all I hear when
you open your mouth.

605
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,590
Guy thinks he's the king of the world,jetting
around,and you're stuck here cleaning up the mess.

606
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,980
With Seth?I was glad to do it.

607
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,390
Chuck said we were a team.

608
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,780
He's my best friend.

609
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,490
Sit down.

610
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,850
Last chance.

611
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,820
Or you're gonna spend the rest of your
life in a cell half the size of this room.

612
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:56,270
We tried to get back home
after we launched the rocket.

613
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,480
Chuck said he knew the
way,but he was wrong.

614
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,910
Not this place again.

615
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,320
We've been outere e alnight.

616
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,930
We gotta get home.

617
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,220
Too far to jump.

618
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,770
We gotta go around.

619
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,080
That's what you said last time.

620
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,510
How we got lost in the first place.

621
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,540
We're never gonna make it back
before our parents wake up.

622
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,070
- What about your dad?
- I said it's too far.

623
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,560
Standing around talking about
it is just gonna take longer.

624
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,640
We can do it.

625
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,950
You?

626
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,160
Not a chance.Forget it.

627
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,260
We can do anything.

628
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,000
- We're the Rocket Boys.
- Will you shut up about that?

629
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,200
- It's stupid.
- It's not stupid.

630
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,270
- It's the best thing ever.
- You don't get it.

631
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,320
I'm not even supposed to be out here.

632
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,930
My dad finds out,I'm dead,okay?

633
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,060
We go around.

634
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,850
What's this?

635
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,590
Let's go.

636
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,290
I'm with Danny.

637
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,400
You'll never make it,Seth.

638
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,960
Yeah?Watch me.

639
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,250
He's right.

640
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,070
See you at home,suckers.

641
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,620
Almost didn't make it over,fat-ass.

642
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,050
Lay an egg,psycho.

643
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,840
I cleared it by a mile.

644
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,740
Yeah.

645
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,140
Race you to the bend.

646
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,390
I never saw a kid so proud of himself.

647
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,940
Chuck said he was too
weak,he didn't make it.

648
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,710
But he did.

649
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,630
- So how'd he end up in the water?
- I don't know.

650
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,320
We ran on ahead.

651
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,390
Look,Chuck was the leader.

652
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,880
If he said it,it had to be true.

653
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,590
After a while,I started
believing it myself.

654
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,370
But Seth never did.

655
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,830
It just chewed him up on the inside.

656
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,310
I've been checking
into your family,Chuck.

657
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,590
Who knew the Pierces were
such an American dynasty?

658
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:37,120
Yeah,Dad's a war hero.

659
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,670
Built a textile company from
scratch,turned it into an empire.

660
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,120
You got a point?

661
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,650
It's hard to live up to.Only  son..

662
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,220
A lot of pressure on a kid.

663
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,780
I thrived on it.

664
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,310
- Some people do.
- Right.

665
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,540
Right,'cause you were
following in his footsteps.

666
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,720
And 12 years old or
not,you were a leader.

667
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,060
That's why,when Danny fell in
the crick,you tried to save him.

668
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,970
He was so out of shape...

669
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,670
he couldn't hold
himself above the water.

670
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,660
He must've panicked.

671
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,650
That's what
happens,situations like that.

672
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,940
He was going to pull me down with him.

673
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,740
I... I had to save myself.

674
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,630
I... I mean...

675
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,010
so help me,God,I let him drown.

676
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,810
Then covered it up.

677
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:44,170
Papa Pierce found out,worse than being
punished,he'd have been disappointed in you.

678
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,010
It was an accident.

679
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,960
And I spent the rest of my
life trying to make up for it.

680
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,760
You know,there's just this one
little detail that doesn't fit.

681
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:11,830
Danny didn't drown,Chuck.

682
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,510
There's no water in his lungs.

683
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,170
- That's got to be a mistake.
- No mistake.

684
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,910
Someone cracked him in the
skull with a blunt object.

685
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,690
Whack.

686
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,790
We didn't just check into your
family,Chuck.We checked into you.

687
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,020
Being an astronaut
- now that would've gotten your old man off your back for once.

688
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,400
No,but NASA rejected you.

689
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,650
Three times.

690
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,600
Pretty good thing he's not
around anymore to see you.

691
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,310
Bus driver in the sky for rich people.

692
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,620
Now Danny,he was a real leader.

693
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,940
Danny was weak.He was no leader.

694
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,510
Buddies thought he was.Launched
the rocket,made the leap.

695
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,000
Danny said jump and they jumped.

696
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,600
But you...you were scared.

697
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,400
Papa Pierce finds out about
that,might as well not go home at all.

698
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,690
You go to hell,all
right?I was no coward.

699
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,280
- And Danny's death was no accident.
- I want a lawyer.

700
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,900
You're dying to shut us up.

701
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,430
Can see it on your face.

702
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,410
Know what we did to piss you off
- what did Danny do?

703
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,890
Danny shouldn't even have been there.

704
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,370
Danny was no Rocket Boy.

705
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,570
Maybe not at the
beginning,but he made the jump.

706
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,530
He made it across.

707
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,750
He wasn't the hero.I was.

708
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,580
It's okay,Chuck.You can do it.

709
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,100
You're Neil Armstrong,remember?

710
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,310
Just shut up!

711
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,260
I'm not scared,all right?

712
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,900
Then jump.Come on.It's no big deal.

713
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,930
Help me!

714
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,920
Chuck!

715
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,040
Chuck!

716
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,160
Chuck,I lost my glasses!

717
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,510
I can't see!

718
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,160
- Help me!
- Chuck!

719
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,310
Chuck,help!

720
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,090
Chuck!

721
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,910
Chuck,help me!Chuck!

722
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,940
Hey,what's going on?

723
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,600
- I won't tell them you were scared,Chuck.
- Hey,where are you guys?

724
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,420
- You think I was scared?
- What's going on?

"a white shade of pale"by Procol Harum

726
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:32,030
* we skipped the light fandango *

727
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,500
* Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor *

728
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:43,330
* I was feeling kind of seasick *

729
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,490
* The crowd called out for more *

730
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,140
* The room was humming harder *

731
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,450
* As the ceiling flew away *

732
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:10,460
* When we called out for another drink *

733
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,070
* The waiter brought a tray *

734
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:23,750
* And so it was that later *

735
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:29,820
* As the miller told his tale *

736
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:35,440
* That her face,at first just ghostly *

737
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:42,480
* Turned a whiter shade of pale *

738
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,970
* She said there is no reason *

739
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,520
* And the truth is plain to see *

740
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,020
* But I wandered through
my playing cards *

741
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,320
* And would not let her be *

742
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:39,670
* One of 16 vestal virgins *

743
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,610
* Who were leaving for the coast *

745
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,250
* And although my eyes were open *

746
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,260
* They might just as well been closed *
