**********

20
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,550
My name is Jaime Reyes.

21
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,070
And for those who know a little
about Cuban baseball,

22
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:21,171
this is Gonzalo Luque,

23
00:02:21,172 --> 00:02:22,972
the Cuban Mickey Mantle.

24
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,350
And I'm happy to announce
that he has just signed

25
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:27,651
with the Philadelphia Phillies
organization,

26
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,360
and he will report
to the Reading Phils

27
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,061
next week.

28
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,790
Gonzalo would like to say
something.

29
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,320
Hello, America.

30
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,210
Thank you.
And I want to play baseball.

31
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,550
ICE agent says this guy's got
information

32
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:31,651
on a cold job, october '99.

33
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,910
Those are all the possible matches.

34
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,770
A couple of gang shooting,
robbery gone bad.

35
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,580
And two stone-cold who dunits.

36
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,450
- This guy fishing for a deal ?
- Aren't they all ?

37
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,150
Agent Scarcelli, Immigrations
and Customs Enforcement.

38
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,050
Eddy's in our country uninvited.

39
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,310
He got popped for an electronics store
smash-and-grab

40
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:53,411
along with cannabis possession.

41
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,220
The smoke was for religious purposes.

42
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,920
Let me guess : you're looking at a
boat ride back to Port-au-Prince.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,250
Yes,sir.

44
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,980
Eddie'd rath spend a month
in lockup here

45
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:03,381
than go back to the Haitian clink.

46
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,470
Look,I testify,I get to stay,right?

47
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,080
- Depends what you got.
- It was October...

48
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,580
Pretty good memory
with all that

49
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:12,881
praying you be doing, Eddie.

50
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,170
It's the truth.

51
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,880
I remember because of the pumpkins.

52
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,330
Start with location.

53
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,440
That sandlot near Lancaster Avenue.

54
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,690
Wrong answer.

55
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,060
We got no unsolved murders that area.

56
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,540
I warned ya about wasting my time.

57
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,100
It was that baseball player.
He was going to play for the Philes.

58
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,800
Guy's nameas Gonzalo Luque.

59
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,160
Only problem, Eddie,

60
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:41,661
is Gonzalo was killed about five miles
from Lancaster Avenue.

61
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,730
Body was found in the Badlands.

62
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,920
That's not what I saw.

63
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,780
Yo, man.

64
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,160
I come out, the body's gone.

65
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,460
You couldn't swipe Jesus,

66
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:17,061
so you settled for the
Louisville slugger?

67
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,860
You see the car?

68
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
No.

69
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,580
- What about the b
- Perfectly good bat.

70
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,580
I give it to my nephew Patrick.

71
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,680
He hit real keen with it.

72
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,770
Bring us the bat,

73
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:31,071
we'll see what we can do about
prolonging your jail time in America.

74
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,310
Play ball.

75

COLD CASE
Saison 6 Épisode 20

76
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,030
Transcript VO : www.ydy.com

77
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,030
Stealing home

78
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,060
Gonzalo Luque, 23 years old.

79
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,020
Found dead in an alley off Elkhart
in the Badlands,

80
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:20,021
morning of October 22, 1999.

81
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,230
Cause of death :

82
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:23,531
blunt-force trauma
to the chest

83
00:06:23,531 --> 00:06:25,131
resulting in cardiac arrest.

84
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,190
Assigned back in the day figured
that 'hood,

85
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:30,591
Gonzalo was looking for drugs,
guns, or tail.

86
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,960
Played for Double-A Reading.

87
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,310
Guy could rake.

88
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,600
Big league club invited
him to spring training.

89
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,020
Yeah, he'd have won a ring last season.

90
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,730
The bat Eddie the Haitian
says was next to the body.

91
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,130
Bat could be a good match for
the contusion that killed him.

92
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,250
Initls: "ST."

93
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,700
The proffer was asked out that.

94
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,420
He said the letters
were there already.

95
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,970
Lumber could belong to
one of his teammates.

96
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,750
Nobody with those initials
on the team.

97
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,260
So now we got a dead baseball
player's body

98
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:01,961
being moved across town.

99
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,750
Maybe our doer didn't want

100
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:05,351
the lot connected to the body.

101
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,570
I didn't even know there
was a baseball diamond there.

102
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,560
Detective back in '99
spoke to Jaime Reyes,

103
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:13,561
Gonzalo's agent and a cousin,
Juan de la Cruz.

104
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,680
Says here Gonzalo's wife Piedad
and son Andres

105
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:19,081
washed near Key West day
after his murder.

106
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,840
Wanna double-check thastory
along with this cousin.

107
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,210
Find out what Gonzalo
was doing on that field.

108
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,200
I'll see what the agent
remembers.

109
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,230
Guy makes it all the way from
Cuba, ends up ad in an alley.

110
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,980
Oh, Cuban Pete's all over this one.

111
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,500
Yeah, well...

112
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:40,901
I'm half Puerto Rican.

113
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,420
Maybe the doer's Puerto Rican.

114
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,760
All right, everybody, listen up !

115
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,270
Sign-up sheet for
the annual softball game

116
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,671
against the fire department.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,730
We won't get hosed
like we did last year.

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,070
To that end, I've got a ringer
in Patrol.

119
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,730
The guy is unhittable.

120
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,260
Been a rule change this year :

121
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:02,761
mandated coed teams, so...
- Sounds good.

122
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,370
Sign me up.

123
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,530
Can you catch ?

124
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,880
Hell, yeah, I can catch.

125
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,330
You throw like a girl ?

126
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,150
You dance like a white guy ?

127
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,860
All right, pencil ya in alternate : bench.

128
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,350
You throw like girl ?

129
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,660
- ya.
- Catch ?

130
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,240
- Not so much.
- All righ you're our catcher.

131
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,150
And you're riding bitch with
me all the way to Union City.

132
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,090
Located the victim's wife,
Piedad Luque.

133
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,750
All right.

134
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,750
See ya later, Mom.

135
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,120
Make sure you take the bus back.

136
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,940
I don't wanna hear about
you cutting through the park.

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay.

138
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,710
Andres, ven aca.

139
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,840
Please, sit.

140
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,060
Does Andres know the circumstances
around father's death?

141
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,360
No.

142
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,510
I never believed what they said
Gonzalo was doing in that part of town.

143
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,970
He was a family man.

144
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,320
Wondering how Gonzalo could leave
you and your son back in Cuba.

145
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,680
He had no choice.

146
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,680
None of this would have happened if
they didn't taken baseball away from him.

147
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,650
Who's "the" ?

148
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,700
The Cuban government.

149
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,590
They said he and some other players

150
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:24,291
had contact with an
American sports agent.

151
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,910
That agent Jaime Reyes ?

152
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,890
Yes.

153
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,000
After the ban,
it was a nightmare.

154
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,020
No money, no food,

155
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:36,821
no friends.

156
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,110
That why Gonzalo left,
to make a new start ?

157
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,500
Hardest decision of his life,

158
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:46,001
but once he'd made it,
there was no turning back.

159
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,850

*********

162
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,280
And that was it.

163
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,430
The last time I saw him.

164
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,600
You had plans to join him ?

165
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,400
When the time was right.

166
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,110
Hell of a raft trip.

167
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,190
Would have done anything
to see him again.

168
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,250
You stay in touch with him
when he got to Philly ?

169
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,460
It wasn't easy.

170
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,650
Our phone calls were monitored ;
letters opened.

171
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,650
He mention any problem
to you ?

172
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,050
No.

173
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,110
Juan said Gonzalo was very excited
we would be joing him in America...

174
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,660
Juan, his cousin.

175
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:59,361
Yeah, he was my cousin.

176
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,670
But Gonzalito was more
like... like my little brother.

177
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,240
I came to-to America... two
months before he was killed.

178
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,500
Juan, where were you
the nigth Gonzalo was killed ?

You guys are not
Internal Revenue, huh ?

180
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,610
I was, I was removing asbestos,
off the bo at Liberty Towers.

181
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,510
I worked my way up since then.

182
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,390
You ever go to that old sandlot
near Lancaster Avenue with Gonzalo ?

183
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,790
Lancaster Avenue ?

184
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,470
Yeah lot of pickup baseball games there.

185
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,690
Familiar with it?

186
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,730
Not that one. But Gonzalito--
he-he loved baseball.

187
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,370
He would see a game and...
stop to ask if he could play.

188
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:38,971
He always had his equipment
with him.

189
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,000
Is this Gonzalo's bat ?

190
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,630
No, not Gonzalo's.

191
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,150
It's too heavy.

192
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,620
He was a contact hitter.

193
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,280
He could put the ball anywhere.

194
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,830
You know anybody
with those initials ?

195
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,410
No.

196
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,180
You play ball ?

197
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,910
A little in Cuba.

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,130
Pero olvidate-- when I
got here, it was all work.

199
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,260
Did youu happen to see Gonzalo
the day he died ?

200
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,540
I was busy working.

201
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,820
He was training hard.

202
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,600
Getting ready for spring
training in October ?

203
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,600
It what he loved.

204
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,120
Couldn't believe all the things
this country had given him.

This one's reserved for the day
that Cuba's free of its oppressor.

217

May it be soon... and may it be painful.

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,580
No how much money did Gonzalo
tends to make when he got called up, Juan ?

233
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,280
Gonzo made seven dollars a
month playing baseball in Cuba.

234
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,200
He had no idea about millions.

235
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,940
His,uh, agent managed everything.

236
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,180
Jaime Reyes ?

237
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,920
And his agent managed
his money, too ?

238
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:26,420
After he died, Reyes tried to screw
Piedad out of what money was left.

Detectives.

240

Bourbon water ?

241
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:46,740
No. We have so questions about
your former client Gonzalo Luque.

242
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,510
We spoke to Gonzalo's widow.

243
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,160
She said it was your contarcect with him

244
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:52,461
that got him banned
from baseball in Cuba.

245
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,420
I offered him freedom
and a better way of life.

246
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,700
And what'd you offer
his widow after he died ?

247
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,860
Everything Gonzalo had left,
which wasn't much.

248
00:14:59,861 --> 00:15:01,161
He did what they all do :

249
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,280
fancy cars, nice clothes,
jewelry.

250
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,250
We understand you managed his money.

251
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,820
I run a full-service agency.
There's a problem ?

252
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,940
His widow thought that he should've
been more of that money left over.

253
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,600
Piedad never quite
grasped the probate proces.

254
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,970
Exactly how much did she grasp ?

255
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,460
Lay the money out for us, Jaime.

256
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,490
I'm gonna have to find Gonzalo's
records. It could take a day or two.

257
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,230
I put everything in off-site storage

258
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:27,031
when we moved to our new offices.

259
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,750
Well, you've done quite well
for yourself.

260
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,340
I started with a desk in my garage.

261
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,070
Cuban players are good for business.

262
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,570
Well, now, yeah, but..

263
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,030
Gonzalo was my first.

264
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,800
With his skills in today's market,

265
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:39,901
forget it, you're talking about
top-of-league money.

to see someone who's been touched

271
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,100
- Who's he ?
- Eric Hynes.

272
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,530
He got demoted to right field
to make room for Gonzalo.

273
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,360
That's him on the right.

274

275

No.

276
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,510
No, he popped a domestic
assault charge.

277
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,710
And he was arrested for waving
a gun around in a nightclub.

278
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,540

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,750

301
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,600
I gave that to him.

302
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,990
Told him he could grow into it.

303
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,940

306
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,641

a little guilty when..

307

heard they thought he was uptown

308
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,240
You introduce him to some

Nah, Gonz was a pretty
straight arrow.

310

He never told me about that.

00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,240
Gonz was real lonely.

Marisol help relieve him of some

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,050
Let's see it, Mickey D.

358
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,090
Ready ?

359
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,570
We'll see you on the field.

360
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,460
Marisol, your name came up
in an investigation.

361
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,250
Gonzalo Luque.

362
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,890
Like a decade ago,
I've moved on.

363
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,920
Heard you had a thing
for ballplayers.

364
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,780
In our line of work,
we get badge bunnies.

365
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,150
Not into cops.

366
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,420
Too controlling.

367
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,170
That's a shame.

368
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,140
Gonzalo another notch
on your bedpost ?

369
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,590
Okay, what is this about ?

370
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,410
Your boyfriend's found dead, and you
don't come forward with information.

371
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,060
He wasn't my boyfriend.

372
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,860
Well, then, maybe another player
in your roaster

373
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:50,161
took exception to the hours
you were keeping with Gonzalo.

374
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,630
I told you we weren't
together when he was killed.

375
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,520
It was complicated.

376
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,440
Uncomplicate it for us then.

377
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,990
Broke my rule...
and fell for the guy.

378
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,540
How come every time I ask you about
them, you change the subject ?

379
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,510
You know how things are over there.

380
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,130
I... want to know about my family.

381
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,910
Andrecito looks just like you.

382
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,690
**

383
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,770
***

384
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,650
I write, I call.

385
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,300
She's being careful.

386
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,390
- Things are not so easy for her.
- What ?

387
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,280
She... she's with someone else ?

388
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,100
She filed for divorce.

389
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,170
Gonzalito, what did you expect ?

390
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,150
I'm losing myself here, primo.

391
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,410
- I need to get my son back.
- No, no, no, Andrecito is just a kid.

392
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,490
It is too dangerous.

393
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,690
******

394
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,710
Nothing is impossible here Juan.

395
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,350
I'm gonna do what I have
to do to see my son.

396
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,260
He had this whole other
life I didn't know about.

397
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,890
They split up, but he wanted
to get his son back.

398
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,690
He still needed her
to bring him over.

399
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,980
Not what I signe up for.

400
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,660
That's when I knew it was over.

401
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,700
All right.

402
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,550
Agent Scarcelli's faxing me
Piedad's INS file.

403
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,090
Maybe shed some light on what happened
in Cuba between Piedad and Gonzalo.

404
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,330
They broke up.

405
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:40,431
He must have been
a pretty convincing guy,

406
00:22:40,432 --> 00:22:43,332
get her chaperone his son
across the Florida Straits.

407
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,800
It's still a ticket out Cuba.

408
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,360
Can't say I blame her.

409
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,970
Ever been ?

410
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,910
Nope.

411
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,140
Don't you want to see it before
there's a Starbuck on every corner ?

412
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:03,460
I'll leave that to the tourists and
hipsters sporting Che T-shirts.

413
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,190
I know too much
about what happens there :

414
00:23:07,191 --> 00:23:10,391
sip mimosas poolside in Havana.

415
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,580
Got something ?

416
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,240
Let me see Gonzalo's
immigration file.

417
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,160
Sunburned and blistered.

418
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,420
Look like she spent a week
at sea the way Gonzalo did ?

419
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,860
Not on a raft, she didn't.

420
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,960
More like overnight speedboat ride,
point-to-point.

421
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,170
Divorce wasn't the only
thing Piedad was lying about.

422
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,300
How was it you got to America,
Piedad ?

423
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,080
I told you already.

424
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,380
You also told us you
were married to Gonzalo.

425
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,770
Failed to mention that you
filed for divorce back in Cuba.

426
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,670
Neighborhood spies were watch us.

427
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,960
The divorce made it
easier for us to escape.

428
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,510
Or maybe you were pissed off
'cause he ditched you,

429
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:11,511
came to Amica, got rich and
dipp into who knows what ?

430
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,050
No.

431
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,960
When Gonzalo got suspended from baseball
in Cuba, it destroyed him.

432
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,340
He had to leave.

433
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,850
But you divorced him
after he defected.

434
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,960
I had no choice.

435
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,620
When Gonzalo came to America,

436
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:28,521
the government threatened
to take our house.

437
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,680
I was protecting Andres.

438
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,100
Divorce meant survival.

439
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,770
We're trying to solve
your husband's murder,

440
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:38,371
but you keep lying to us.

441
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,630
You look pretty good for
just coming off a raft, Piedad.

442
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,990
If you tell us again how you brought your
two-year-old on a 90-mile raft trip.

443
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,790
Andres is gonna come home to see
his mom being hauled away in cuffs.

444
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,550
- I was affraid...
- Of what ?

445
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,030
The man who brought us here.

Gonzalo went to see this man.

465
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,690
In Miami ?

466
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,700
No.

467
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,570
He was in Philadelphia.

468
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,060
He arranged the whole thing ?

469
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,640
Yes.

470
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,510
You think this man killed
your husband ?

471
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,460
Yes.

472
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,670
We need a name, Piedad.

473
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,590
All I have is my son.

474
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,170
They already took Gonzalo.

475
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,060
- You want to be safe ?
- Yes.

476
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,920
You make this right and tell us
who did this to Gonzalo.

477
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,240
The men called him "Oz".
That's all I know...

478
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,280
internal recycling ?

479
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,570
Nope.

480
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,510
But an old CI of mine is.
Goes by Clifford.

481
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,430
- As in big red dog ?
- As in white boy with dreads.

482
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,380
Guy's a walking Ghetto pages of
the illegal import/export biz in Philly.

483
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,800
He collects cans on the side ?

484
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,350
Sells to the addicts after
they get their returnable money.

485
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,550
- Enterprising.
- Yo, Clifford !

486
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:15,551
They try to do me like Rodney King !

487
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,040
Shut it, Clifford.

488
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,420
If I stroke out,

489
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:20,421
the last thing I gonna do
is shoot your dumb ass !

490
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,940
Yo, blue, I ain't holding.

491
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,390
That's good 'cause we need
a name, Clifford.

492
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,900
Oh, snap !

493
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,850
You looking tight, baby girl.

494
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,970
- Didn't know it was you.
- Called me "baby girl" again...

495
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,830
I apologize for triculating.

496
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,910
Clifford is at your service.

497
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,290
Guy's name is Oz.
You heard of him ?

498
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,830
You trying to see the Wizard ?
Why didn't ya say so ?

499
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,640
Here to see the Wizard.

500
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,510
Grab the rack.

501
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,250
Come on.

502
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,200
Osmany Leon.

503
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,950
Take a walk.

504
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,350
Come in. Sit down.

505
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,140
Cafecito ?

506
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,090
We're here about Gonzalo Luque.

507
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,660
You smuggled his family
out of Cuba.

508
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,790
I don't even own a boat.

509
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,600
Fence, import/export contreband...

510
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:30,701
'cause I'm guessing fluff an' fold ain't
the one thing you were into.

511
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,690
I'm a legitimate busiman.

512
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,140
I'am a member of the
Chamber of Commerce.

513
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,420
Representing what ? The lollipop Guild ?

514
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,730
I'd hate to disrupt
your business here, Osmany.

515
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,190
Screw up your cash flow,
dinging your name on the street.

516
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,210
You gonna shut me down ?

517
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,070
Okay.

518
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,850
Or you could tell us why you held

519
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:49,851
Gonzalo's wife and kid
in a motel room in Miami

520
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:51,752
till he came up with more cash.

521
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,190
It's important to give
back to the community.

522
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,430
Reunite families.

523
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,680
Long as they pay the freight charge.

524
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,530
Sounds like Gonzalo
had a problem paying up.

525
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,010
Bish to D4.

526
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,360
Mate in two.

527
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,810
Nice.

528
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,230
I'm calling the cavalry.

529
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,990
Have 'em toss this place.

530
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,400
Gonzalo Luque and I
had mutual interests.

531
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,370
He wanted to get his family back
and I wanted to send a message.

532
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,240
Tranquilo.

533
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,730
I did what I was told, paid my money,
and now you tell me there was a problem ?

534
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:49,710
These are the people that your friend
arranged for me to pick up.

535
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,400
Piedad and Andres.

536
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,460
And...

537
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,620
No, no.

538
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,940
- Where ara my parents
- You know those two ?

539
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,880
Teammates back in Cuba.

540
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,770
Look, this is a mistake.

541
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,070
I paid for my family !

542
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,140
That's right.

543
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,200
40,000 was the family discount.

544
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,400
Ballplayers are a premium.

545
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,970
Reyes never told me
about these players !

546
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,250
Well, that makes two of us,
Gonzalo.

547
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,980
You tell Reyes I need another 40K.

548
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,650
I want my family ! Desgraciado !

549
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:22,100
Oyame. I get my money and
you get your wife and son back.

550
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,130
The rest its between you and your agent.

551
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,680
Now, buena noches, Gonzalo !

552
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,890
Gonzalo wanted to
reunited with his family.

553
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,670
I respect that.

554
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,100
But Gonzalo thought Reyes was
gonna get his entire family over.

555
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,510
We were both being gamed.

556
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,250
Reyes came up with the money ?

557
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,750
That same night.

558
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,280
And I kept my word.

559
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,800
I released Gonzalo's wife and son.

560
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,490
Who were these players ?

561
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,240
I like to look at the box scores.

562
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,310
Lots of interesting information.

563
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,920
Those are some big names.

564
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,340
Gonzalo go to see Reyes ?

565
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,730
Wouldn't you ?

566
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,860
Come over if you want but...

567
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:30,961
The only thing
you have to worried about is...

568
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,580
I'm in the middle of something here.

569
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,400
Yeah, you were.

570
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,560
This guy takes a whole
lot more than ten percent.

571
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,570
Please !

572
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,500
Butch, give me five minutes,
okay ?

573
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,700
Signed for $6 and $8 million a piece.

574
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,070
That's a tiddy commission.

575
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,400
They were worth it.

576
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,260
Worth having Gonzalo's wife
and kid held for ransom ?

577
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,710
That's it. I'm calling my attorney.

578
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,560
Why ? Only thing you need to
worry about right now

579
00:31:54,561 --> 00:31:55,961
is immigration violations.

580
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,850
But we'll leave that up
to the feds, huh ?

581
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,930
Unless you killed him.

582
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,430
Look. Gonzalo wanted
his familly here.

583
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,820
I said to him that I
was gonna take care of it.

584
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,750
I didn't want him getting
mixed up in that mess.

585
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,750
You mixed him up real good,

586
00:32:09,751 --> 00:32:11,651
but you couldn't fool
the great and powerful Oz.

587
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,090
I was gonna fix it...

588
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,920
By stealing Gonzalo's money to
smuggle players out of Cuba

589
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,630
Big league talent. Can see why
you wanted those players so bad.

590
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,170
Baseball players are a
prized possession to Castro.

591
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,370
By liberating them, I stick it
to that bearded bastard.

592
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,240
You're a real freedom fighter.

593
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,900
Using Gonzolo's account
to stake your little empire.

594
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,280
Only one problem, Reyes.

595
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,470
You got caught.

596
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,060
I didn't kill Gonzalo.

597
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,190
But he wanted to kill me.

598
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,570
I trusted you, Jaime.

599
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,150
You're looking at this
the wrong way.

600
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,440
How else am I supposed
to look at it, huh ?!

601
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:46,660
My wife and son are being held hostage
and my parents are still in Cuba.

602
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,600
Don't worry about it.
We'll get 'em out.

603
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,880
And I'm gonna cut you in
on the deal.

604
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,300
Wrong. I'm cutting you out.

605
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,720
You fix this,
and then we're done.

606
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,640
Come on, Gonzalo. Gonzalo, don't.
Come on, Gonzalo.

607
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,150
I got a scout coming.

608
00:33:00,151 --> 00:33:02,251
He's going to try out
your cousin.

609
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,140
We're gonna make it work.

610
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,490
I tried to tell Gonzalo but
he didn'd want to hear it.

611
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,830
I put the money back in his account.

612
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,960
His cousin Juan-- what did
he have to do with this ?

613
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,880
Juan was the first Cuban player
I ever tried to contact.

614
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,620
His fastball used to
top off at 95-plus.

615
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,500
His change-up
was a de-cleater.

616
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,910
- Used to ?
- Yeah,

617
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,960
by the time he came over,
the guy had lost it.

618
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,990
But Gonzalo idolized Juan.

619
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,240
k hands.

620
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,440
Nice.

621
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,940
Checked out Juan's story.
Got some major holes.

622
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,150
Starting with his immigration file.

623
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,130
Turns out,
Juan was on Gonzalo's raft.

624
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,310
Wet-foot/dry-foot.

625
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,290
Gonzalo reaches dry land
and stay,

626
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:49,491
Juan gets arrested in the water,
sent back to Cuba the same day.

627
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,610
Bet you that it was
warm homecoming.

628
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,400
16 months later,

629
00:33:53,401 --> 00:33:56,001
Juan takes another raft,
lands on Key Largo.

630
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,520
Picked up along with five other rafters
begging for water at a tbar.

631
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,050
That and Juan's alibi has got
many holes as softball team.

632
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,380
Where'd you say
you were working again ?

633
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,760
The day Gonzalo was killed ?

634
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,650
Liberty Towers.
Construction a security.

635
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,790
I spoke to your boss.

636
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:16,491
Said you were working
a jobsite off Lancaster Ave.

637
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,060
Next to the lot
where Gonzalo was killed.

638
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,730
You think I killed him ?

639
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,300
Gonzalito was like my brother.

640
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,210
Didn't play just a "little" ball
in Cuba, either, Juan.

641
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,190
You pl with your cousin
in the Cuban League.

642
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,150
Right with the Industrials.

643
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,080
What did they call you ?

644
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,620
- ***
- The cannon.

645
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,820
Must have had a hell
of a fastball.

646
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,600
Till you and Gonzalo were
banned from playing in Cuba.

647
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,080
You were with Gonzalo
on that raft.

648
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,390
Gonzalo made it to dry land.

649
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,000
You didn't.

650
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,890
Got your repatriation order
from immigration.

651
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,960
April 6, 1998.

652
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:04,790
Gonzalo got to stay.
They sent you back.

653
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,430
You went back to Cuba as a traitor.

654
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,120
They threw you in prison, Juan.

655
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,520
This is my grandfather
and his older brother.

656
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,670
The revolution split 'em up.

657
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,330
One to Philly,
the other to Castro's jails.

658
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,280
Decades go by.

659
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,760
My grandfather gets word
from Cuba his brother's dead.

660
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,210
A month later,
my "abulo" is gone.

661
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,050
From what ?

662
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,760
Heart attack.

663
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:58,870
My father, workingstiff said,

664
00:35:59,571 --> 00:36:02,571
"His heart didn't stop.

665
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,810
It broke."

666
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:11,420
What happens in Cuba
stays with us.

667
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:15,410
I know what they do
to traitors in prison, Juan.

668
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,410
Ballplayers ?

669
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,310
They ripple 'em.

670
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:24,510
Put you back out on the street,
as a warning the others.

671
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:39,700
It isn't just a game, is it Juan ?

672
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,400
If I would have just made it
that day... on the beach...

673
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,880
You'd be playing baseball
right now.

674
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,610
Gonzalo would still be alive.

675
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:59,960
All this time, we couldn't figure out
why his body was moved from that sandlot.

676
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,480
Then we realized, Epispal was only
a few blocks away.

677
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,920
You went to get the car.

678
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,540
You were trying to get
your cousin to the hospital.

679
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,590
I was trying to save him.

680
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,580
We know you didn't mean
to hurt your cousin.

681
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,830
You just...

682
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:22,331
lost control.

683
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,030
We're trying to help you here, Juan.

684
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,570
He didn't make it.

685
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,620
Eso, eso ! Juan.

686
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,590
The canon is resurrected !

687
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,040
I heard the canon from the car,

688
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,541
and I had to hit something !

689
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,560
What happened ?

690
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,500
*******

691
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,020
In Miami?

692
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,190
- SO
- ye,primo,congratulati

693
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,060
No. Reyes screwed me.

694
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,150
That son of a bitch-- he gave my
parents' spots a couple of ballplayers.

695
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,150
**

696
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,870
*****

697
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,880
He thougth I was stupid, but I took
care of it, got rid of him.

698
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,320
You did what ?

699
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,930
I fire him.

700
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,760
Reyes was gonna get me
a try out.

701
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,210
Scouts were gonna...
- Hermano, I'll get you the tryout and scouts.-

702
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,400
When they see your fastball...
Hey, man, you know what ?

703
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,150
This is your first out right now.

704
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,220
Now, give me the cannon.
Come on.

705
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,360
*****

706
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,040
I know you got it, man.

707
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,380
***

708
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,480
Juan ?

709
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,880
You okay ?

710
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,270
You need to warm up more.

711
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,580
Throw more pitches, man.

712
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,270
It's just that you don't know.

713
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,590
Don't know what ?

714
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,620
You don't know what
they did to me over there.

715
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,070
******

716
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,180
I'll pitch too, heh ?

717
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,710
Hey, Juan, man.

718
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,740
- I can't.
- Yes, you can !

719
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,000
Mira, primo, no importa.

720
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,940
Don't worry about, huh ?

721
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,010
- I'll take care of it, all right ?
- What are you going to take care of ?

722
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,000
Mi familia ?

723
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,640
My parents ?

724
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,970
Primo.

725
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:51,110
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't even be here.

726
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,200
Juan, what are you talking about ?

727
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,740
**

728
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,510
I built that raft !

729
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,270
I know that.

730
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,190
To get us here.

731
00:39:58,810 --> 00:39:59,610
I know.

732
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,620
To get us here ! Us !

733
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,410
They sent me back.

734
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,220
- Everything's gonna be okay now, Juan.
- No, it's not !

735
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,910
It's not.

736
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,710
You want to know
what they did to me in there ?

737
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,180
Every time they broke my arm,

738
00:40:20,581 --> 00:40:22,081
they laugh at me.

739
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,550
Se reyan de me !

740
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,630
We got a single,
and we got a triple !

741
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,310
And we got a home run !

742
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:37,240
- Juan... Juan.
- They took my arm.

743
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,960
They took my arm away !

744
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,780
I have nothing.

745
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,040
I have nothing !
I have nothing.

746
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,180
No tengo nada !

747
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,170

................

754
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:45,050
* Un palmar Baion con
las brisas del mar *

755
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,230
* Y al amanecer
Se oy solo tranquilidad  *

756
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:57,260
* Tu latido pide volver.
Tierra de mi amor *

757
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:03,261
* Tu recuerdo vive sin poder *

758
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:11,261
* Oh, mi Dios,
Desde el cielo escucha mi voz *

759
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:21,520
* Cuanto mas tengo que
rezar pidiendo mi regreso y ? *

760
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:26,730
* Vida mas simple la de ayer *

761
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:36,831
* Vida mas simple la deyer *

762
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:50,220
* Un cafa Era al precio
de la amistad *

763
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:59,021
* Sin tener que hablar
se ofrecia una mano fiel *

764
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:08,370
* La ninez respetaba sin preguntar *

765
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:12,871
* Y siempre al comer *

766
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,570
* La familia unida en el hogar *

767
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:25,270
* Oh, mi Dios Desde el cielo
escucha mi voz *

768
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:35,620
* Cuanto mas tengo que
rezar pidiendo mi regreso y ? *

769
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,860
* Vida mas simple la de ayer... *

770
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:49,561
