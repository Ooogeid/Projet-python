1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,200
My name's Pete.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,800
And I'm an alcoholic.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,800
I used to be the best
stickup man in North Philly.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,300
It's no joke.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,600
Wasn't nothing I couldn't rob.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,800
Let you in on a secret.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,600
It's not the gun.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,000
It's the attitude.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,900
I'd look
in my victims' eyes.

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,400
Talk to 'em real quiet.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,900
Remind 'em what's on the line
if they play hero.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,600
They'd never have
another Christmas,

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,400
never hear their wife
laugh again.

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,700
Never hold their children.

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,300
No problem after that.

16
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,700
Eh, that's not me anymore.

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,800
Been inside 12 years.

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,500
Sober every one of them.

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,800
Wasn't easy.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,000
A lot of time
to worry on my mistakes.

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,900
This kept me going.

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Letter from my kid
when he was five years old.

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,600
Caught the football
for the first time.

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,900
Only I wasn't the one
who threw it to him.

25
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,800
All I could do,
write him back.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,400
Which I done consistent.

27
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,600
I haven't heard back
in a while.

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,500
Don't blame him.

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,400
Kid's got a life.

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,500
Proud of that.

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,700
I'm gettin' out today.

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,600
Goin' back to my son.

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,900
Got a job lined up.

34
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,400
Gonna do it right this time.

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
God granted me
a second chance.

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,500
I'm takin' it.

37
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,100
Check out the looky-loo.

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,500
Narcs's too busy

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,300
congratulating themselves
to clean up for us.

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,500
Hey, get lost, buddy.

41
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,500
This is
a crime scene.

42
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,900
Yeah. Mine.

43
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,800
But you have my permission
to stay, Cagney.

44
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,500
I never heard
that one before, Serpico.

45
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,100
Touch?

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
Who's the jackass?

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Eddie Saccardo.

48
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,200
Runs the narcotics
task force.

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,100
This is his bust.

50
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,200
Heard of him.

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,800
Keyed in on every corner
in Philly.

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,100
They say he knows
the crime goin' down

53
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,200
- before the crook does.
- Yeah, regular Superman,

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
this guy.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,200
Know the name Pete Doyle?

56
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,000
Fugitive. Pulled his
prints off five guns

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,200
with murders to match
ten years ago.

58
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,700
Could never track him
until now.

59
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,800
- This him?
- No.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,900
This is.

64
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,700
What's with the hand, Manny?

65
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,800
That's my gimmick.

66
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,300
"The man with the hand. "

67
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,800
- Catchy.
- Yeah.

68
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,300
I wanted to get one of those
voodoo guys to shrink it for me,

69
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,900
so I could wear it
around my neck.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Your boss said I could observe.

71
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,900
That's my drug dealer.

72
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
Where's the rest of Pete Doyle?

73
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,700
Guy that belongs to that hand.

74
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,300
Assume he owed you money.

75
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,600
Double-crossed you.

76
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,800
That's why
you killed him.

77
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,700
No, he didn't kill Pete.

78
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,200
- I didn't kill him.
- You found him.

79
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,400
- I found him.
- Where?

80
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,000
Fifth street.
Past Lehigh.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,700
Used to run a corner over there.

82
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,200
I used to run a corner
back there.

83
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,000
When was this?

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,400
About ten years ago.
Fall, I think.

85
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,400
It was chilly.

86
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm on my way to work.

87
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,300
There it is.

88
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,200
- The hand.
- The whole body.

89
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,200
Couldn't leave the guy
on the corner.

90
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,600
Bad for business.

91
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,700
Mmm, decide the right thing
to do is saw off the hand?

92
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,300
He wasn't needin' it
no more.

93
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,300
You know how much I made selling
fingerprints off that thing?

94
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,600
What about the gun?

95
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,700
Keep that, too?

96
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,400
Hell no.

97
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,600
It had a body on it.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
I sold the gun.

99
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,900
Kept the hand.

100
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,400
Duh.

101
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,300
What do we have
on Pete Doyle?

102
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,600
Besides the fact he's favoring

103
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,700
his left hand?

104
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,800
Some kind
of stickup man

105
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,600
in North Philly.

106
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,200
Uh, Pistol Pete was

107
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,500
the stickup man.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,200
Had real corner
appeal.

109
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Neighborhood
loved him.

110
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,600
Always good for
a couple bucks.

111
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,800
Real Jesse James type.

112
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,900
Went away for armed
robbery in '85.

113
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,300
Got pinched busting a check
cashing joint. North Kensington.

114
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,800
Arresting officer caught him
with the cash

115
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,600
and a.44 Smith & Wesson.

116
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,900
Pete's weapon
of choice.

117
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,500
20-year sentence.

118
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,300
Served 12.

119
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,500
Good behavior.

120
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,300
You memorize his rap sheet?

121
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,200
No, we used to date.

122
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,200
So Pete gets out
September '97.

123
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,800
Ends up dead
a few weeks later.

124
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,300
He might have pissed
someone off.

125
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,600
Says here he had a partner.
Tommy Connell.

126
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,800
Career jag-off.

127
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,300
You'll find him
at The Tap House.

128
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,300
Polluting the same stool
for 20 years.

129
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,000
Pete also had
an ex.

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,100
Jules Murphy.

131
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Used to be
a party girl.

132
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,700
Pete knocked her up.

133
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,200
Then he had the nerve

134
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,100
to get put away.
Hear she holds a grudge.

135
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,500
What's the matter?
It's not in your file?

136
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,400
I'll pick up
Tommy Connell.

137
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,000
Guess I'll pay
the ex a visit.

138
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
Why are you
still here?

139
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,800
Waiting to take possession
of my drug dealer.

140
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,600
Well, we'll call you
when we're done.

141
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,900
Been waiting
for the day

142
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,100
you'd arrive,
tell me Pete's dead.

143
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,600
Pete did a number on you, Jules.

144
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,100
Left you high and dry
with a kid to boot.

145
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,900
You won't get
an argument out of me.

146
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,900
But I didn't kill him.

147
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,500
He was my first love.

148
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,400
Real sweet.

149
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,200
Yeah, he could be.
Charming, too.

150
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Part of him, at least.

151
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,100
- The other part didn't care about no one or nothing. 
- Not even your kid?

152
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,300
Uh, Petey Jr.

153
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,700
Way he saw it,

154
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,000
family got in the way
of his "career. "

155
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,800
But that kid
adored the man.

156
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,000
Must have been tough
when Pete went away.

157
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,600
I was left
to fend for myself.

158
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,200
Lot of resentment there.

159
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,600
I was too busy raising my boy.

160
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,000
That's when we got together.

161
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,400
Tried to make a good home
for Petey.

162
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,800
Yeah. And we did.

163
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,900
So,

164
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,100
Pete comes back.

165
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,000
Discovers his son's
got a new dad...

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,900
The nerve.

167
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,500
Don't see him
for 12 years.

168
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,600
An hour after he's released,
he's on our doorstep.

169
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,100
Girard to North Sixth,
cut over on Spring.

170
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,900
No...

171
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,600
he told me you
know this town.

172
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,300
No, you're going
to be blocked up.

173
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
See you readin'
that book.

174
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,100
Like it got the answers
to everything.

175
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,100
I used to read a lot
of those crime books.

176
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,700
Pass the time.

177
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,700
You're him, aren't you?

178
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
My dad.

179
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,800
Yeah.

180
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,100
You're in jail.

181
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,300
Not anymore.

182
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
What? You escape?

183
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
No.

184
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,200
Done my time.

185
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,900
I'm free.

186
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,800
Got it when I was your age.

187
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
My declaration of independence.

188
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,800
You got any tattoos?

189
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,300
That was a joke.

190
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,600
I got you somethin'.

191
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Your favorite.

192
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
Told me about it
in one of your letters.

193
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,400
I was five.

194
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,800
I play soccer now.

195
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,500
I didn't know.

196
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
It's okay.

197
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,400
I've had a lot a time to think.

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,700
I'm not standin' here
expectin' the world to stop

199
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,800
now I'm back.
You got a life.

200
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,500
Only hope maybe
I can be a part of it,

201
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,800
if that's okay with you.

202
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,400
Get in the house, Petey.

203
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Jules.

204
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,200
You look great.

205
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,900
I know, you're pissed.

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,900
Don't worry.

207
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,300
I dried up inside. Got my GED.

208
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm committed to doin' right

209
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,900
- by you and Petey.
- You think

210
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,600
you can just drop by?

211
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,500
Not even the courtesy
to let us know?

212
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,600
I meant to.

213
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,000
I kept tryin'
to put pen to paper.

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,700
Explain it all. Nothin' came.

215
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,600
But I told Petey.

216
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,500
Last couple letters.

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,500
Petey didn't get your letters.

218
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,400
I kinda figured.

219
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,400
Leave us be, Pete.

220
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,900
Honestly, for the sake
of the boy, it'd be better

221
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,600
if you're still
in jail.

222
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,400
Never came back after that.

223
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,400
Only good thing he did:
staying away.

224
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,100
Petey Jr. ever go looking
for his dad?

225
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,100
Seek out the hero?

226
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,800
Kept his eye
on the prize.

227
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,500
College, a real job.

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,500
Never mentioned
Pete again.

229
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,500
Tommy Connell,
Pete Doyle's wingman.

230
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,200
You're a real
sweetheart, Tommy.

231
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,500
Been reading your record.

232
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
You can read?

233
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,500
Ooh. Laugh riot.

234
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,100
You and Pete
pulled some

235
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,900
crazy jobs back in the day.

236
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,200
Oh, the nostalgia file.

237
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,200
That's 20 years ago.

238
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,200
- Don't got nothing recent?
- What about Pete Doyle's murder?

239
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,200
I heard about that.

240
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,400
It's a damn shame.

241
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,200
You can do better
than that, Tommy.

242
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,900
I took it as a blow.

243
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,700
- We was like brothers, me and Pete. 
- He went down hard

244
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,400
for that check-cashing heist
back in '85.

245
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,000
We know you were the second man.

246
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Could've got five years
had he gave you up.

247
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,000
Did 12 instead.

248
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,700
Real stand-up guy.

249
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,100
So maybe Pete starts thinking
you owe him.

250
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,500
You figure it's easier

251
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,900
to clear the books.

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,800
If what you were

253
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,000
saying was true,

254
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,700
and I admit nothing,

255
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I'd have been grateful.

256
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,200
One way of looking
at it.

257
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,000
Other way, a debt like that
becomes a burden

258
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,400
- hanging over your head.
- Shows what you know.

259
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,600
I did everything
I could to help when he got out,

260
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,100
but he wouldn't accept.

261
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,700
This was a different Pete Doyle
than the one I knew.

262
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,800
I've been calling and calling.

263
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,700
Your cousin
was my counselor inside.

264
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,200
Said you hired guys like me.

265
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,100
Used to.

266
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,700
I got burned too many times.

267
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,600
Not by me.
I'm a man of my word.

268
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,800
I'll work straight commission.

269
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,600
I got an aptitude.

270
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,800
It's win-win.

271
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
All I want's a chance.

272
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't have any openings.
Sorry.

273
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
Please, don't come here anymore.

274
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,000
Tough break,

275
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,500
but what'd you expect?

276
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,300
I got other options.

277
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Whoa! That's the "hello"
I get 12 years later?

278
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,600
- I got to hear on the street you're out? 
- Sorry.

279
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,700
Forget it.

280
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,900
Let's get a drink.

281
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,000
Can't. Looking for a job.

282
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,600
I'm crewing up for a piece
of work if you're interested.

283
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,900
Real job, Tommy.

284
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,400
"Real job," huh?

285
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,700
Let's see.

286
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,200
"Busboy.

287
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,500
"Car wash.

288
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,400
Janitor?"

289
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,600
Ain't what you were meant for,

290
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,400
cleaning some mope's toilet.

291
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,600
This isn't you,
Pistol Pete.

292
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,000
Ain't that guy no more.

293
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,300
I've been spending

294
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,000
some time with that
kid of yours.

295
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Comes by the place.
We talk about the old days.

296
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,400
He loves those stories.

297
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,700
I don't want you talking to him.

298
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Serious.

299
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,200
He's a good kid.
You stay the hell away.

300
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,800
Catch you next time.

301
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
But I ain't worried.

302
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,600
I know the real
Pete Doyle's in there.

303
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
You have him come see me
when he's ready.

304
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,100
Expect us to believe
he went straight?

305
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,500
As a frickin' arrow.

306
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
Wanted a regular job,

307
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,800
regular life.

308
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,700
Didn't matter.

309
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,100
Got him killed anyway.

310
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,000
Pete Doyle checked in weekly
with his PO,

311
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,700
never missed curfew,
tested clean for drugs.

312
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,900
Guy was making
a go of it.

313
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,400
Got to respect
the effort.

314
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,400
Just found a report
on the arrest of Peter Doyle

315
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,200
back in September '97.

316
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,900
Weapons charge.

317
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,000
So much for regular life.

318
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,700
Oh, not the father-
the son, Petey Jr.

319
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,100
Not the choirboy
his mother said.

320
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Picked up at St. Alvin's Prep
with a gun,

321
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,100
.44 Smith & Wesson.

322
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,700
Pete's weapon of choice.

323
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,600
Same caliber

324
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
we think killed him, too.

325
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,200
????

326
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,700
i don't buy this pistol pete turning over
a new leaf.

327
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,700
That's 'cause you're cynical.

328
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,900
It's like that
old parable,

329
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,200
the tiger
and the mouse.

330
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
Mouse gets eaten,
even though

331
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
he pulls the thorn out;
it's in his nature.

332
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,300
No, you mean
the spider and the frog.

333
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,600
Frog gets bitten after he takes
the spider across the river.

334
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,300
No, it's the mongoose
and the scorpion.

335
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,800
hey, guys, I don't care what it is.

336
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,500
There's no way a hard con
like this guy goes legit.

337
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
What about the son?

338
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,800
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

339
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,200
Yeah, a regular Al Capone.

340
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Want to tell us about the gun
you brought to school?

341
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,300
Seriously?
That was, that was

342
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,100
- years ago.
- It's a felony.

343
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,600
Yeah, but I pleaded
to a misdemeanor,

344
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,500
and my record was supposed
to be sealed.

345
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,300
It turns out your father

346
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,700
was murdered
around the same time.

347
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,300
Same type of gun, too.

348
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,100
Pete Doyle wasn't
any kind of father to me.

349
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,100
See, things like that

350
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
make me think
you might've gone after him.

351
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,500
Lot of anger, frustration...

352
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, I was angry.

353
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
I was the kid
whose dad was locked away.

354
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,300
That was my identity.

355
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,300
Pistol Pete's son.

356
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,400
I brought the gun to school,

357
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,700
showed everyone they were right,

358
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,400
got arrested and expelled.

359
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,900
Not my happiest time.

360
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,500
Understandable,
way he abandoned you.

361
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,000
I'd write him letters.

362
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Like he cared.

363
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,300
I was convinced
that he would break out

364
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,500
and take me away.

365
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,700
Ridiculous, huh?

366
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,000
When he finally did show up?

367
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
He wasn't any kind of legend.

368
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,900
Mom said you only
saw him one time.

369
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,900
Yeah, once he was back.

370
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,500
Knowing he was there,

371
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,400
I couldn't help
but go looking for him.

372
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,400
Your mom know you're here?

373
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,400
You shouldn't disobey her.

374
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,200
I know.
You're my dad.

375
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,500
I should get a say.

376
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,100
Wow. This is where

377
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,200
you beat up that
group of Marines.

378
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,200
Tommy told me the story.

379
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,900
You shouldn't put too much stock
in his version.

380
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,000
It was one guy.

381
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
You need to get
out of here.

382
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,900
They got rules about underage.

383
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,700
You saved them.

384
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,700
The letters I sent.

385
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,900
You kept them.

386
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,300
Every one.

387
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,500
Kept me alive in there.

388
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,100
So how come
you never wrote back?

389
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,900
Hey, mop boy!

390
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,400
Go home, Petey.

391
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,600
Well, if it ain't Pistol Pete.

392
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,400
I heard you were out.

393
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,500
You remember me?

394
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,200
Officer O'Leary.

395
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,100
Guy who put your
worthless ass away.

396
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,300
Hey, watch the shoes.

397
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,300
My good pair.

398
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,500
Nice gig you got here.

399
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,400
Sure you working
some scheme on the side.

400
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,100
I'm out of the game.

401
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,000
I told you to watch

402
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,700
the damn shoes.

403
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,900
Dad?

404
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,100
Well, hell, Pete.

405
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,700
You got a son.

406
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,400
Little thug in training.

407
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,800
It's in the blood, right?

408
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,300
Get out of here, Petey. Go.

409
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,700
Yeah, run along, Petey.

410
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,000
Sure I'll be locking
you up real soon.

411
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,100
Give you one of my famous
tours of the city.

412
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,400
Remember those, Pete?

413
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,500
Think the kid'll take

414
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,900
to it like you did?

415
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,800
Do it. I'm begging you.

416
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,700
You'll slip up.

417
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,200
And when you do,
I'll be there.

418
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,600
And we'll settle this.

419
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,300
The way he just took it.

420
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,700
Kept cleaning up
after that jerk.

421
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,000
It was humiliating.

422
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,900
Your pop was supposed
to be larger than life,

423
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,700
but he was just a man.

424
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,000
No, he was a coward.

425
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,200
And a liar.

426
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,500
Best thing he ever did,

427
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,900
disappearing from my life.

428
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,400
How's retirement
treating you, Dan?

429
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,300
Living the dream, John.

430
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,200
Only have to work two jobs
to cover my alimony.

431
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,400
But that's not why I'm here.

432
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,700
It's about Pete Doyle.

433
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,800
Detective Miller.

434
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,400
I heard you
found his hand.

435
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,100
I only wish I was there
to see it come off.

436
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,300
Kind of harsh.

437
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
You know how Pistol Pete
got his name, sugar?

438
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,500
His first robbery.

439
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,200
Liquor store.

440
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,200
He pistol-whips the salesman.

441
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,500
Cracked his head open.

442
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,000
Guy's in a coma
for a month.

443
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,600
Pete was 15.

444
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,700
He'd kill you
as much as look at you.

445
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,400
Maybe you did it first?

446
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:30,900
You threatened

447
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,400
Pete Doyle in a bar
full of customers.

448
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,200
I told him I was waiting
for him to slip up.

449
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,400
Which I was.

450
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,100
John, tell her what it was like

451
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,400
when cops actually
did police work.

452
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,600
Like your famous
tour of the city?

453
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,800
Take 'em out to the river,

454
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,300
show 'em the business end
of your nightstick.

455
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,600
You know, I'm not going
to explain myself.

456
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,200
I had a job.
I did it good.

457
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,200
Way we heard it, it was personal

458
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,400
- between you and Pete.
- Yeah.

459
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,500
I took it personal.

460
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,300
Every score he made.

461
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,900
Every time he flashed a roll
of dirty money in a bar.

462
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,900
That smug grin on his face.

463
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
But I didn't want to kill him.

464
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
- What did you want?
- Put him where he belonged.

465
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,000
Prison.

466
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,000
I knew I'd get my chance.

467
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,800
He was back
to his old ways in no time.

1
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,750
Thanks for this,I guess.

2
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,000
I been going to these meetings,one form

3
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,500
or another for years,

4
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,040
mostly in the joint.

5
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,100
I'm out now a few weeks.

6
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,300
Yeah.

7
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,900
Working the program like they tell you.

8
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,310
"Make amends. "

9
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,320
Found a higher power,

10
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,430
tried to change from what I used to be.

11
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,310
Problem is, nothing changed with me.

12
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,980
The way you're looking at me now.

13
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,150
I can see it.

14
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,050
That suspicion that I might snap.

15
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,020
I can live with it.

16
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,370
But my son...

17
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,950
the disappointment he has

18
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,820
watching me humiliate myself for nothing.

19
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,630
How's a man supposed to live with that?

20
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,760
Well,maybe I should just give in?

21
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,000
Accept what I am, bad through and through?

22
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,160
At this point,

23
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,980
I don't see why the hell I shouldn't.

24
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,920
That's all I got.

25
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,940
You should have locked him up.

26
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,940
Parolee strapped like that.

27
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,760
I didn't want him on a gun charge.

28
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,520
Word on the street was

29
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,290
that,uh,Pete and Tommy had

30
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,140
a big score.

31
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
They were ridin' around in a stolen car.

32
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,400
Gearing it up.

33
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,900
I was gonna catch 'em in the act.

34
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,270
But it never happened.

35
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,400
Pete fell off the face of the planet.

36
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,180
I never figured out what they were plannin',

37
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,320
but one thing I knew.

38
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,090
???

39
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,660
Still in there?

40
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,050
Will hasn't even come out to take a pee.

41
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,540
We been goin' at this guy eight hours.

42
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,600
Any luck? Just lawyered up.

43
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,540
Sending him down to wait for his mouthpiece.

44
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,570
What's this?

45
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,030
Bunks Barbecue.

46
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,330
Best in Philly.

47
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,490
Just a little thank you for being

48
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,930
so cooperative in releasing my prisoner to me.

49
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,580
Oh,it's official, Saccardo.

50
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,380
You're goin' in my will.

51
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,780
Hmm. What a guy.

52
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,540
Hey,admit it.

53
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,690
You missed me.

54
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,040
Hey!

55
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,860
Tommy!

56
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,920
Been a while.

57
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,050
How's your sister?

58
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,390
Hey,she still,uh, "cocktailing" over

59
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,110
at the Hi-Life?

60
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,010
Yeah.

61
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,110
Don't worry.

62
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,530
Lawyer's on the way.

63
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,060
But what I hear- been hitting the bottle again.

64
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,940
Don't know how confident I'd be if I was you,Tom.

65
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,520
Cat got your tongue?

66
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,320
You're not still mad about Phil the Pill?

67
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,490
It was an honest misunderstanding.

68
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,660
I mean,accidents happen,right?

69
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,580
Every day.

70
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,090
Hey,Detective?

71
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,380
Get him out of here.

72
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,530
Now you hurt my feelings.

73
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,620
Please. Excuse me.

74
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,410
That ain't right, bringin' him here.

75
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,720
You shouldn't do that to a guy.

76
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,190
Tell me about Pete,Tommy.

77
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,410
You two were planning a robbery.

78
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,380
I want to make a deal first.

79
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,020
All we care about is Pete's murder.

80
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,730
Complete immunity then in writing.

81
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,240
I could bring Saccardo back in to discuss that with you.

82
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,850
All right. Point made.

83
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,820
I knew it had to be the right job

84
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,410
to get Pete back to work.

85
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,860
Something... choice.

86
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,780
Still took a lot of convincing,

87
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,560
but he changed his mind.

88
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,660
Why'd he finally give in?

89
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,930
I had an ace in the hole.

90
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,730
I'm ain't gonna lie to you.

91
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,290
This is ambitious.

92
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,400
It's probably the biggest score

93
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,550
we ever had.

94
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,160
We're talkin' a bank?

95
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,690
All will be revealed in due course.

96
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,250
Drink your beer. I'm on the wagon.

97
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,290
I figure we go in heavy.

98
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,660
Shotguns blazing, kneecap one of the guards.

99
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,190
Show 'em we mean business.

100
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,980
And if the guy dies, that's felony murder.

101
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,800
Guaranteed life.

102
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,600
I don't intend to get caught.

103
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,780
I didn't,either.

104
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,600
You got to understand these guards:

105
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,600
whatever they're protecting doesn't belong to them.

106
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,310
End of the day, they want to go home.

107
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,130
Let 'em know there's no profit for dead heroes.

108
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,150
Damn!

109
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,910
My man is back.

110
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,300
Now will you tell me what the score is?

111
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,510
Hmm. Why don't you ask the brains of the operation?

112
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,630
You should see the look on your face.

113
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,730
You put him up to it?

114
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,460
It was my idea.

115
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,080
Kid worked the whole thing out.

116
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,460
Just like his old man.

117
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,990
Hmm? What are you thinking?

118
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,660
You're better than this.

119
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,390
You're smart. You got a future.

120
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,280
As what,a bus driver? Yeah.

121
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,070
An office worker?

122
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,830
Yeah. I don't want that.

123
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,170
I want this with or without you.

124
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,400
Guess that's settled then.

125
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,810
Let's have a drink,hmm?

126
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,730
To the future.

127
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,410
Pete let his 15-year-old son participate

128
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,480
in an armed robbery?

129
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,160
Wasn't any older when his cherry broke.

130
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,510
What was the score,Tommy?

131
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,420
Hey,you don't think Junior did his dad?

132
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,930
That'd be messed up.

133
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,830
What was the score?

134
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,910
Gosh,Detective,

135
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,630
it was so long ago...

136
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,110
Lawyer's here.

137
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,200
Don't talk

138
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,240
to a suspect of mine without asking again.

139
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,660
He gave you what you wanted,

140
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,900
didn't he? Until his lawyer showed up.

141
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,650
I'm not the one who called him.

142
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,420
My desk. My bad.

143
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,270
The guy you mentioned in there,

144
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,350
uh,who freaked Tommy out.

145
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,750
Phil the Pill?

146
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,580
Who is he?

147
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,450
Friend of Tommy's from the block.

148
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,590
Kind of famous for his bad luck.

149
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,430
Arrested him one time up on this roof.

150
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:40,120
Guy tried to run from me, fell off,crippled himself.

151
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,440
Hmm. Like I said,bad luck.

152
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,440
He fell off?

153
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,430
That's how the story goes.

154
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,890
You got to try these ribs.

155
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,830
You lied to us,Petey.

156
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,150
Said you never saw your father

157
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,680
after that time at the bar.

158
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,910
I didn't.

159
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,110
Lying again.

160
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,570
We know why you brought the gun to school.

161
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,230
Wasn't to prove a point.

162
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,390
For armed robbery.

163
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,720
The family business.

164
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,380
Talked to Tommy,huh?

165
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,240
Made you out to be

166
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,720
some kind of criminal mastermind.

167
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,690
Ready to put his hand on the Bible,

168
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,650
say you're the triggerman.

169
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,710
We're givi you a chance

170
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,180
to get out in front of this thing.

171
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,580
The day of the robbery,

172
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,360
I was with Pete in the car.

173
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,420
It's all right,Petey.

174
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,900
You idolized your father.

175
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,910
Wanted to be him.

176
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,990
You brought him the score.

177
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,100
Figured you'd earned your right at the table,

178
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,560
your father's respect, but something went wrong.

179
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,710
Something did,Petey,

180
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:50,850
'cause he ended up dead.

181
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,280
I wasn't looking for his respect.

182
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,650
I was lookin' for a reason to respect him.

183
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,450
He was pathetic.

184
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,300
Cleaning up after drunks,

185
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,020
getting pushed around.

186
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:03,990
I wanted him

187
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,670
to be the man

188
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,250
that I had heard about growing up.

189
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,810
I wanted to believe.

190
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,240
Give me that.

191
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,200
Ready to use it?

192
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,010
Yeah.

193
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,910
Point it at me.

194
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,450
Do it.

195
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,270
Like this?

196
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,240
Look me in the eye now.

197
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,330
Show me you're willing to go all the way,

198
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,130
squeeze that trigger, put my brains on the windshield.

199
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,760
I'm a man. I can do it.

200
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,270
You think you're tough?

201
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,350
Some kind of

202
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,950
rd man,'cause you gave us

203
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,740
a street address?

204
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,410
Wrote down a time? Please stop.

205
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,850
It means nothing.

206
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,230
You mean nothing. Dad...

207
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,150
Want to know why I never wrote you letters?

208
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,030
'Cause you weren't worth the effort.

209
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,290
You have zero to offer.

210
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,840
Get out of here!

211
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,300
Truck's right on time.

212
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,710
What's up with the kid?

213
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,720
Forget about him.

214
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,250
Let's do this.

215
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,110
Your stepdad drove an armored car?

216
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,290
I told Pete everything.

217
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,550
I told him the,uh, the delivery route,

218
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,770
how the guards orated, how much money there was.

219
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,440
I got screwed.

220
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,560
You consider

221
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,260
what would have happened if he hadn't cut you out?

222
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,420
What happened to the heist?

223
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,520
It fell apart.

224
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,820
Bernie called the cops.

225
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,560
Did he know who was robbing him?

226
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:28,410
A few weeks after her stepson's ex-con dad shows up...

227
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,350
Bernie's armored car

228
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,220
gets hit.

229
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,880
Bernie's a smart guy.

230
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:36,580
Must have considered Pistol Pete Doyle was involved.

231
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,230
???

232
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,750
d You're a modest guy,Bernie.

233
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,710
Way you dress...

234
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,260
...your attitude.

235
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,080
Unassuming.

236
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,770
I was in your house the other day.

237
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,120
Had no idea I was sitting across

238
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,070
from a hero.

239
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,880
Single-handedly thwarted the robbery of your armored car.

240
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,150
I don't talk about it.

241
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,850
Well,it was brave.

242
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,880
Fighting off two masked gunmen.

243
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,430
Yeah,got a commendation from the company.

244
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,820
Even offered you a reward.

245
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,990
You turned them down.

246
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,830
Didn't think it was right,

247
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,660
gettin' extra for doing my job.

248
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,680
Oh.

249
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,250
Two weeks later,you quit.

250
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,150
Yeah. Was it the danger?

251
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,280
Comin' so close to dyin'?

252
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,640
Or was it guilt,

253
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,650
Bernie,for what happened that day

254
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,400
with Pete and Petey Jr.?

255
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,470
Put this on me all you want.

256
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,570
Leave Petey Jr. out.

257
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,970
You knew who was robbing you.

258
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,760
That Petey Jr. must have helped set it up.

259
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,340
Question is why you never told.

260
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,800
I was looking out for the boy.

261
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,860
I could see the change in him when his dad came back.

262
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,780
He was spinning in place.

263
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,480
You raised him like your own.

264
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:00,000
Tried to teach him right from wrong,best I could.

265
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:01,910
To be decent.

266
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,580
And Pete- he was the wrong kind of influence.

267
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,010
Petey Jr. ate it up.

268
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,380
Adored that man.

269
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,420
Romanticized him.

270
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,860
I had to do somethin'.

271
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,750
Did you chase after him, take his gun?

272
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,410
Shoot him down for Petey Jr. 's sake?

273
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:20,480
I would have if it had come to that.

274
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,850
But it played out different.

275
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,390
All clear.

276
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,520
Give me the gun. Don't even think it.

277
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,360
Give me the gun. Drop it!

278
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,610
Don't do it. Drop your gun. Drop it right now.

279
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,730
Drop it!

280
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,010
Get out of the truck. Get out of the truck!

281
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,770
Put your hands on the dash.

282
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,910
Nothing stupid.

283
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,140
I think we hit the jackpot.

284
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,250
I said, "I think we hit the jackpot. "

285
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,010
I think we hit the jackpot now.

286
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,610
Get on your knees.

287
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,410
Come on, on your knees.

288
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,240
I'm gonna need you to do something.

289
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,980
I'm gonna need you to hit whatever panic button you got

290
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,800
in here.

291
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,970
Yeah,I do it,you starshooting. Ha.

292
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,340
Usually,I'd be giving you all the reasons

293
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,750
why you shouldn't act,

294
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,640
but this is going to get bloody real soon.

295
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,740
You ain't fricking listening!

296
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,390
You got the boy to consider.

297
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,660
Think about Petey.

298
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,150
He's at a rocky age.

299
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,750
He needs the right guidance.

300
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,960
That's on you.

301
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,120
Why are you doing this,Pete?

302
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,260
Just do it.

303
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,360
You take care of him,okay?

304
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,750
You're his dad now.

305
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,110
What the hell?!

306
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,180
Cops pinned it on a couple pros

307
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,860
who got killed in some other robbery attempt

308
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,970
a few weeks later.

309
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,050
You didn't set them straight.

310
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,630
Would have brought up a whole bunch of questions.

311
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,180
Petey didn't need this hanging over him.

312
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:38,470
Cards he was playing- convict dad and all-

313
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,910
he had enough to deal with.

314
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,960
Pete kept saying...

315
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,330
"We hit the jackpot. "

316
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,360
What'd he mean by that?

317
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,760
Tell you, the way he was looking around.

318
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:54,620
Desperate,like he expected the seventh cavalry.

319
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,080
It's a signal.

320
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,980
Undercover says the magic words: "We hit the jackpot"-

321
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,710
the bust goes down.

322
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,020
Pete an informant?

323
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,400
Well,Robbery had no undercover ops in the fall of '97,

324
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,300
didn't know about the armored car heist until it happened.

325
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,390
But we've got a body mic

326
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,680
and wire checked out of the Communications Unit

327
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,740
the day of the robbery,

328
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,140
and guess whose John Hancock

329
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,060
is on the log.

330
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,470
Officer Daniel O'Leary.

331
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,140
O'Leary was a rule-bender.

332
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,150
But dirty?

333
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,150
He was obsessed with Pete Doyle.

334
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,070
He put a mic on him,sent him into the heist,then killed him.

335
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:31,990
That's guesswork.

336
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,060
No body,no evidence, nothing but a signature.

337
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,530
So we pull the equipment, run it for prints,DNA.

338
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,540
Already checked.

339
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,060
Communications threw that stuff out a couple years ago.

340
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,960
Well,O'Leary doesn't know that.

341
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,520
Know what this is?

342
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,120
The wire you checked out of Communications

343
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,540
back in September '97.

344
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,820
The one you gave Pete Doyle to wear

345
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,310
day of the armored car robbery.

346
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,940
Sent it to the lab for a work-up.

347
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,580
What do you think they'll find?

348
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,720
What,do you figure you're scaring me

349
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,030
with the smoke and mirrors?

350
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,390
I'm not some mope.

351
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,030
I got 20 years on the job.

352
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,680
True enough.

353
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,060
You were a good cop, maybe a little rough.

354
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,070
All this fuss over that dirtbag?

355
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,710
And I was the only one trying to get

356
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,400
Pete Doyle off the street.

357
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,680
The only one who cared.

358
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,730
Yeah,we talked to your old lieutenant.

359
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,910
You tried to get Robbery

360
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,580
to investigate Pete and nobody listened.

361
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,920
Meanwhile, you were being pushed

362
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,220
out of the department.

363
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,610
Eh,forced retirement.

364
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,160
My style didn't mesh

365
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,670
anymore.

366
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,690
Didn't appreciate you.

367
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,040
You know who complains?

368
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,000
Lowlifes pissed 'cause they got pinched.

369
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,750
And Pete's out there living the life of Reilly.

370
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,920
Eh,crooks get rich, cops get screwed.

371
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,430
We know you were there the day of the heist.

372
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,200
Juries eat this kind of evidence up.

373
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,920
Work with us here; it'll go easier.

374
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,320
You expect me to believe that this is real?

375
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,240
I'd stake my career on it, like you did with Pete Doyle.

376
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,290
It's hanging heavy on you.

377
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:15,090
Let it out,O'Leary. It's time.

378
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,040
All those years on the beat.

379
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,190
I was doing good.

380
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,450
I had honor.

381
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,500
Didn't mean anything.

382
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,780
Pete came to you,didn't he?

383
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,920
Full cooperation,

384
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,850
as long as his son was left out.

385
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:43,720
I was supposed to go

386
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,040
to my bosses over it.

387
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,680
But you didn't.

388
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,490
I was halfway out the door,

389
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,290
looking at a future with nothing but my pension,

390
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,890
a lifetime of debt.

391
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,460
You ow how much money they keep in those trucks?

392
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,860
You decided to rip him off.

393
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,220
What was he going to do?

394
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,410
Call the cops?

395
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,960
Hey!

396
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,480
Where the hell were you?

397
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,500
The money. Where's the money?

398
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,530
Tommy nearly killed a guy back there!

399
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,450
Where is it,Pete?

400
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,920
It's on the truck where it belongs.

401
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,540
I had the guard hit the panic button.

402
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,530
You were supposed to see this through no matter what.

403
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,090
And you were supposed to stop it,remember?

404
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,410
Before anyone got hurt.

405
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,830
My kid's stepfather was in there,

406
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,290
for crying out loud.

407
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,490
Did he recognize you?

408
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,010
What?

409
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,710
What are you doing?

410
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,190
I can't go down for this.

411
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,130
Why didn't you just get the money?

412
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,250
That's what this was for you.

413
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,150
Money.

414
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,640
Just shut up!

415
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,230
Get down on your knees.

416
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,900
Do it.

417
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,760
You got ID'd.

418
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,170
Questions are going to come up.

419
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,710
You know what they do to cops in prison?

420
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,420
I feel sorry for you,O'Leary.

421
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,610
At least I'm honest.

422
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,020
Stop it! I took my second chance.

423
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,830
I did it right, like I said I would.

424
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,540
Nothing you do

425
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,820
to me now changes that.

426
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,100
I'm a good man.

427
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:28,990
What are you?

428
00:42:11,640 --> 00:43:25,630
