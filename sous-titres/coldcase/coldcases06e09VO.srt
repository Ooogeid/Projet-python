00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,500
* She come true *

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:22,640
* Ah,look at that girl
Can blue eyes be so blue? *

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:30,550
* Look at the way she walks
Listen when she talks *

6
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,390
* With each word my heart just skips *

7
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,070
* Oh,if I could kiss those lips,mmm  *

00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,610
* Look at that girl Do

* Ah,look at that girl She's
walking straight to me *

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,290
Look at me,Rita.

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,170
How about a little more
sunshine on the goodies,huh?

12
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,670
Zip!Men like to imagine,not see.

13
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,880
Not this man.

14
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,640
You ain't seeing nothing
tonight,you keep it up.

15
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,170
Oh...Betty,fix that sleeve.

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,520
There's nothing's wrong with it,Zip.

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,520
Just move it up an inch.

18
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,330
Yeah,like that.

19
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,170
Big difference.

20
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,590
Hey,hey,hey,every detail
matters in one of my pinups.

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,350
That's why Monty knows I'm the best.

22
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,430
Listen,this magazine is gonna be
a lights-out,call-the-doctor smash.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,690
Cornucopias of cash,my friend.

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,630
Cornucopias.

25
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,550
Here's another fan
letter from Beanie,Ree.

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,780
"Dear Ms. Flynn,thanks
for writing me back.”

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,000
"I put your pinup in my locker today.

28
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,560
You are prettier than all
the stars" in the sky.”

29
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,070
Oh,he's so sweet.

30
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,560
Yeah,play with the straw,Ree.

31
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,620
- So,how was the picture show last night?
- Didn't go.

32
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,130
Well,I thought you had a date.

33
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,120
So did I.The rat didn't even call.

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,560
Oh,you should have come over.

35
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,250
Some of Zip's New York
friends were in town.

36
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,460
You party all night?

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,310
Danced with the sunrise,koo koo.

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,630
We're going national.

39
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,210
My new mag's a go.Rita,they
want you for the cover.

40
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,150
Zip,you're gonna take the picture.

41
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,160
To Rita...

42
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,910
the soda jerk who changed my life.

43
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,810
To everyone here.

44
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,890
The only family I ever had.

45
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,260
Let's paint the town red tonight!...

46
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,200
Jones?

47
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,400
We got to find another bar.

48
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,420
Got one in mind?

49
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,880
How about...

50
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,800
Jones?

51
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,480
Uh,Detective Rush?

52
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,440
- Yes?
- Yeah,Gus Medica.

53
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,130
I'm sorry; this is the
only time I could get here.

54
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,580
Uh,we spoke on the phone yesterday.

55
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,860
Rita Flynn?

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,300
Oh,right,the pinup girl.

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,260
It's a '53 homicide.

58
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,530
Detective Valens.You
a relative,Mr.Medica?

59
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,650
No,uh,just a fan.

60
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,130
Rita's pinup got me
through the Korean War.

61
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,510
My grandson was just
deployed to Afghanistan.

62
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,530
It has me thinking about Rita again.

63
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,960
Uh,this book came out a week ago.

64
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,160
She was a real bombshell.

65
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,580
Oh,she was more than a great figure.

66
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,220
Her smile gave me hope.

67
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,700
Now,the book says that this is the first time that
anything from Rita's crime scene has ever been published.

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,870
Some records clerk moron probably buddied up
to the media,let them have access to the box.

69
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,450
Mr. Medica,you said you had
new informatio on the case?

70
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,240
Uh,yeah.Turns out I've
had it for over 50 years.

71
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,400
I bought this in 1955 at an
estate sale of Rita's stuff.

72
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,880
It's not your usual cheesecake.

73
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,490
No... now,I'm a collector.

74
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,180
This is unique.

75
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,480
I've never,ever seen
another one like it.

76
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,610
Same clothes.

77
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,010
Same position of the glass on the table.

78
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,050
That's what I noticed:
same outfit,same everything.

79
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,050
Look at the ice.

80
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,960
Almost melted in the crime scene photo.

81
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,060
Papers back then had said it was
probably some creep,broke in...

82
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,080
So,who took this photo?

83
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,660
Photographer's stamp.

84
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,490
As good as a signature
if we could make it out.

85
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,070
May be a new witness.

86
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,590
Or the one who set Rita's final pose.

90
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,920
Rita Marie Flynn.

91
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,500
Grew up poor in Tacony.

92
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,490
Mom died young.Drunk father walked out.

93
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,210
That's a good start in life.

94
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,350
Discovered by Monty Moran at the drugstore
where she worked with her best friend,

95
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,140
Betty Sue Baker.

96
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,960
Jeffries is trying to find her.

97
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,700
Betty Sue.Got to love the '50s.

98
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,140
Downstairs neighbor heard
a gunshot at 9:00,ran up,

99
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,580
found the chain on the front
door broken and Rita's body.

100
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,620
Looked like an attempted sexual assault.

101
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,710
No blood or semen,but
her clothes were torn.

102
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,960
Peeping Tom had been reported in the
neighborhood.Never caught the guy.

103
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,390
No record of this mystery photographer.

104
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,290
Wanted to take a picture Rita didn't.

105
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,780
She kicks his ass out.

106
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,450
He comes back without knocking.

107
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,780
An unregistered Webley .38 was found
outside in the rain near the building.

108
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,660
Matched the body bullet taken from Rita.

109
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,970
Webley's made in England.Maybe it
was registered there.Worth a look.

110
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,430
Rita was on the cover of
almost 30 pinup magazines.

111
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,940
Those come dog-eared?

112
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,310
Research.

113
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,390
Early '50s: last days of
selling sex with a G rating.

114
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,750
You have a pinup girl,boss?

115
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,430
Sophia Loren.

116
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,960
Had her picture taped
inside my algebra book.

117
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,970
That will get you through math class.

118
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,850
Check out these theme shoots.

119
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,950
- Circus Girl.
- Classy.

120
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,750
Rita Dresses for a Night on the Town.

121
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,250
"Planting a Garden.”

122
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,950
Gardening--
that's just hot.

123
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,600
Actually...

124
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,560
that is kind of hot.

125
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,620
Arthur "Zip" Fellig was
Rita's boyfriend.Last to see.

126
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,870
I'll try and track him down.

127
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,210
Check with the ID unit.See what else
they can get from Gus's photo of Rita.

128
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,670
You Francine Rafferty?

129
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,410
- Depends.
- On what?

130
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,130
On what you want.

131
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,050
I got a backlog of
surveillance videos to blow up.

132
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,280

Professional print right

139
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,930
So,this wasn't mass-produced?

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,620
No,original.

141
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,710
Straight from a darkroom.

142
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,220
You missed first base,by the way.

143
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,060
Sorry?

144
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,590
Softball game last Saturday.

145
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,860
You missed it by a foot.

146
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,710
You were too busy
admiring your home run.

147
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,610
I played second base.

148
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,590
Oh,yeah.Yeah,that's right.

149
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,780
What about the,uh...

150
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,550
uh,rubber stamp?

151
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,250
Popped the ink and dirt traces.

152
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,550
Got this.

153
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,940
Stanley Nopell.

154
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,930
Great work,Frankie.Thanks.

155
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,270
You know,I touched that base.

156
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,960
The saddest lies are the
ones we tell ourselves.

157
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,400
Say cheese is right.

158
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,430
Welcome to Glamour World.

159
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,410

Detectives Valens and
Miller-- Philly Homicide.

161
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,550
- We're here about Rita Flynn.
- Rita?

162
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,880
My God,after all these years.

163
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,890
Looks like you haven't forgotten.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,820
She's more popular than ever.A whole
new generation is falling in love.

165
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,080
500 bones?Better hope so.

166
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,730
It's an original signature
there.It's very rare.

167
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,840
Check out my Web site.My prints
of her are selling like hotcakes.

168
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,960
Understand you worked with her.

169
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,430
We were a team.A good pinup
isn't just about the model.

170
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,440
We're tracking a
photographer Rita worked with.

171
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,610
Took this.

172
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,620
Stanley Nopell?

173
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,410
- You know him?
- No.

174
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,230
Wasn't even aware that she
worked with other photographers.

175
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,180
Seem surprised.

176
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,950
Well,Rita and I were both under
contract to Monty Moran,and...

177
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,410
no,Rita was faithful to me
on both sides of the camera.

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,170
Here you go,pops.

179
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,020
I'm yours exclusively.

180
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,510
You won't regret it.

181
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,780
We're like the immortal team
of Buonarroti and Cavalieri.

182
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,310
- Who are they?
- No idea.

183
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,400
I heard that line in a movie.

184
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,320
Look,Rita.

185
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,300
He asked me out.

186
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,740
He's got blue eyes to die for.

187
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,450
Isn't he a dish?

188
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,150
Supper and dessert.

189
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,120
- Who is he?
- He's a banker.

190
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,980
He's really sweet.

191
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,540
Oh,Betty.

192
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,610
This one feels lucky.

193
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,270
Um,are you Rita Flynn?

194
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,790
No,she's the Pope.

195
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,700
- Can I have your autograph?
- Sure thing,doll.

196
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,350
Oh,golly.

197
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,970
Drool is so charming.

198
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,770
I used to jerk soda for that fella.

199
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,640
Bet he didn't ask for
your autograph then.

200
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,040

- Come on,Ree.Do it.

Rita was the life of the...

218
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,800
She was my life.

219
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,940
We were going to get married.

220
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,180
All that male attention
make any boyfriend jealous.

221
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,000
Ah,it's just part of the business.

222
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,340
Long as she went home with me.

223
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,050
Back in the day,you said you were
home the night Rita was killed.

224
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,280
Hit the sack early that night
for a big shoot in the morning.

225
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,540
What about Monty?

226
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,190
He could've hired this
Nopell guy for another shoot.

227
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,260
If he was a photographer,Monty would
have known him.He knew everyone.

228
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,210
But you never heard of him?

229
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,700
No.I told you I...I didn't.

230
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,210
Stay in town,Zip.

231
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,410
I might be back for a headshot.

232
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,800
Rita...

233
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,030
Yeah,she was a sweet kid.

234
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,910
She was like a daughter to me.

235
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,400
Yeah,to this day I blame myself.

236
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,830
Why's that,Monty?

237
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,570
Well,I made her famous.

238
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,160
And with fame came the
attention of men,good and bad.

239
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,310
In those days,any creep could
find her address in the phone book.

240
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,940
- You own a gun back in '53,Monty?
- No.Why?

241
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,910
Well,police never took a
statement from you back then.

242
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,070
Well,I thought she was
assaulted by some sick pervert.

243
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,340
Did Rita have her picture
taken by anyone besides Zip?

244
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,120
Oh,guys always wanted
to take her picture.

245
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:50,760
See,the thing about a good photo,you can
stare at it over and over and still find...

246
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,480
a new meaning in it.

247
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,510
We're looking for a photographer
named Stanley Nopell.

248
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,170
Took this picture of Rita.

249
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,430
You ever work with him,Monty?

250
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,750
Stanley Nopell?

251
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Never heard of him.

252
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,470
Did Rita mention anyone in particular
might have been bothering her?

253
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,710
No,she never said anything.

254
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,530
But,well,there...

255
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,360
there was a fan.

256
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,340

I don't know.

I wish I could buy something new.

264

- Sure.

No,he was just a boy.

it was teenage hijinks.

Right.

Really is.Understand you were
president of her fan club.

293
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,870
You bet.This was back in the '50s.

You were stalking her.

306

Look,maybe I was a little
bit too,you know,zealous.

307
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,490
I admit,I did follow her around a lot.

308
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,590

Your dad said this was a restaurant.

316
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,500
I told my dad I'm waiting tables.

317
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,030
- Please,Rita,just go.
- You need money?

318
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,140
I could lend you some.

319
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,170
- You got $500 for all of last years' rent?
- Doesn't your dad pay for...

My dad drinks away every
penny I make from photo shoots.

And they pay for it.

324
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,990
But,Betty,this isn't you.

325
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,790
What if Blue Eyes finds out?

326
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,000
How would he find out?

327
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,290
- Oh,no,Betty,I'd...
- Go to hell!

328
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,970
Yeah,I thought they were friends.

329
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,750
But that girl...

330
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,210
she was angry.

Ashamed or something.

332
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,650
Shame.

Guess that's something a panty
sniffer like you don't suffer much,huh?

334
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,670
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Such a big fan of Rita,

335
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,680
why didn't you tell somebody about this?

336
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,100
I was a minor.

337
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,470
I wasn't even supposed
to be in that club.

She made a lot more
money than you as a model.

352
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,210
Now,how about you?You get
paid enough to make ends meet?

353
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,080
I suppose.

354
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,420
You remember a club
called The Red Curtain?

355
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,130
Ms.Rush,that was a long time ago.

356
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,010
My father was an alcoholic
who needed my help.

357
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,340
I'm not proud,but...

358
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,620
I did what I had to do.

359
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,120
Desperate people do desperate things.

360
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,850
If you're implying I had anything
to do with Rita's death...

361
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,280
You lied about the fight,Betty.

362
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,370
I was upset.

363
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,360
Rita calmed me down.We
had a heart-to-heart.

364
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,220
- When was this?
- At the club.

365
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:16,200
Only Rita could find humanity
in such a depressing place.

366
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,450
(sultry jazz music plays)

367
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,570
I'm so sorry.

368
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,230
I just lost my temper.I'm
under such pressure.

369
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,800
You don't have to apologize,Betty.

370
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,410
- I just want to help you.
- I know.

371
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,530
So what was that surprise
that you came to show me?

372
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,460
Remember when I was taking pictures?

373
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,720
Ta-da!

374
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,860
There's a great one of you.

375
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,570
But these aren't glamorous.

376
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,990
Ordinary life can be beautiful,too.

377
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,370
Ordinary life?What
are you talking about?

378
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,390
I don't know.Real stuff.

379
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,000
Remember when we were jerking soda,all
the crazy characters who would come in?

380
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,190
You mean like
Half-a-scoop Lou?

381
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:04,930
Yeah!

382
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,370
"A full scoop's bad for the joints.”

383
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,110
See,I miss people like that.

384
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,680
Oh,yeah...See him?

385
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,780
That's a face with a thousand stories.

386
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,710
Get that camera out of here!

387
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,940
Lady,you better destroy that picture,or
so help me,I'll do it for you myself!

388
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,330
Get off me!

389
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,650
You know that guy?

390
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,740
Regular.

391
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,460
Named Reg Donaldson.

392
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,620
Came back from the front
with a few screws loose.

393
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,110
World War II vet?

394
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,170
Everyone walked around him on eggshells.

395
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
The scariest guy in a scary place.

396
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,450
You know if he carried a gun?

397
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,840
I saw him pull it one night on a
drunk who took his seat by mistake.

398
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,990
So you saw this man pull a gun
on someone; Rita's shot to death;

399
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,440
and you never went to the police?

400
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,080
Detective...I saw this when
I was working as a dancer.

401
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,180
Good to see you turned
your life around,Betty.

402
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,430
Think of anything else,give me a call.

403
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,670
- Found something?
- Maybe.

404
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,110
Here.

405
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,320
At first,I thought this
was a lighter.You see that?

406
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,920
Yeah,what is it?

407
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,370
Here,look closer.

408
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,230
Camera that took this was a Leica 3A.

409
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,450
It's unique for the time.That's
actually the self-timer switch.

410
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,130
Are you listening?

411
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,490
The Leica 3A,self-timer.

412
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,870
Saying Rita took that photo herself.

413
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,810
Exactly.

414
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,010
Turns out that American shell-shocked
war vet from the strip club

415
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,590
spent time in a psych ward in England.

416
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,090
Along with our gun.Check this out.

417
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,100
ID unit says the photo Gus
brought in was a self-rtrait.

418
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,800
But the stamp says Stanley.

419
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,650
It's that song she used to sing.

420
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,910
"Istanbul was Constantinople.

421
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,200
Now it's Istanbul...

422
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,900
""Not Constantinople.

423
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,160
Istanbul was Constantinople.”

424
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,760
"Now it's... Istanbul.”

425
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,400
Rita... was Stanley Nopell.

426
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,590
Saying she was a photographer?

427
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,330
Trying to be,at least.

428
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,110
Not a lot of female photographers
back then,so she makes up a man's name.

429
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,640
Snaps a shot of Reg
Donaldson with a stripper.

430
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,550
Yeah,married guy,caught red-handed.

431
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,420
Guy's half off his nut already.

432
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,150
Not a photo you want
coming home to the missus.

433
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,810
So this guy wasn't going
after Rita the pinup girl.

434
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,270
He was after Rita the photographer.

435
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,630
Ever spend time in
the UK,Mr.Donanaldson?

436
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,290
I thought this was about Rita Flynn.

437
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,450
Well,if you could answer the question...

438
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,110
I was in England after the war.

439
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,610
Pick up a gun while you were there?

440
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,370
- No.
- But you owned a rearm?

441
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,890
A Browning .22.I worked
nights in a bad neighborhood.

442
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,070
Understand you spent some time
under a doctor's psychiatric care.

443
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,390
What is this?

444
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,580
We've got witnesses saying
you threatened Rita Flynn.

445
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,110
What?You think I shot her?

446
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,390
She had a photo that could
have broken up your marriage.

447
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,260
My marriage was already broken.

448
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,990
I overreacted.

449
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,950
I-I just wanted to be anonymous.

450
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:37,580
Anonymous?

451
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,020
I was pretty messed up after the
war.Couldn't relate to people.

452
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,580
Just a...

453
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,810
bottle in a bar.

454
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,800
Did you see Rita again,Reg?

455
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,220
Yeah,she found me and apologized.

456
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,610
Asked me to help her out,take
her around the old neighborhood.

457
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,040
- Where's that?
- Tacony.She wanted to take pictures.

458
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,220
She pulled me out of the dark.

459
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,700
She said she was going to show me the
pictures,but then I read in the paper that...

460
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,100
What a world.

461
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,960
Where were you that night,Reg?

462
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,330
Same place I was every night:
The Red Curtain,trying to forget.

463
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,840
Rita mention anyone she
was having problems with?

464
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,030
No,she was in a good mood.She...

465
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,780
said she was thinking
about quitting modeling.

466
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,750
Quick follow-up.

467
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:36,200
Think Rita got that photo developed somewhere
or could she have done it on her own?

468
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,170
Lots of photography clubs back then.

469
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,160
- Home darkrooms were pretty common.
- Right.

470
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,640
So...who are these people?

471
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,310
Your great-grandfather
in there or something?

472
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,380
No,I-I found it inside a used book.

473
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,430
Every time I look at it,I
see something new.You know?

474
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,800
That guy's derby hat
there,that woman's smile.

475
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,170
I wonder what made her smile.

476
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,940
Yeah.I love the mystery
of old photographs.

477
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,570
- We'll never know.
- Well,maybe we do.

478
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,540
You see that guy?He's
knocking boots with her.

479
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,820
Just whispered in her ear,"My
compartment,five minutes.”

480
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,550
No.

481
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:18,890
She just slipped a slow-acting
poison in that guy's drink.

482
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,430
- Why?
- Well,it's her husband.

483
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,660
She's gonna inherit a million bucks.

484
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,680
Wicked imagination,Frankie.

485
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,510
Is your cell phone dead?

486
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,690
My phone?No.

487
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,380
Quick follow-ups are phone calls.

488
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,230
Unless there's another
reason you stopped by.

489
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,270
Yeah.I got reservations.

490
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,950
- You and me.
- Dinner?

491
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,840
- No.
- What did you have in mind?

492
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,660
That a yes?

493
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,780
Yes.

494
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,990
Hey,Miller got a hit on the
gun.Registered to a Philip Moran in London.

495
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,620
Moran?Related to Monty Moran?

496
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,490
His unRe.

497
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,520
Couldn't be our doer because
he died in January '53,

498
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,360
ve months before Rita was murdered.

499
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,630
Uncle could have given it to Monty.

500
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,160
And Monty started a British
version of See Magazine in 1950.

501
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,700
Traveled back and forth all the time.

502
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,320
Got a little gun problem,Monty.

503
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,310
Haven't we already gone over this?

504
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,610
Yeah,which means either
you're lying or...

505
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,830
you're starting to slip.

506
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,100
Wasn't your magazine
that got Rita killed.

507
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,320
It was your gun.

508
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,890
I never fired a gun in my life.

509
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,240
Except the one that killed Rita.

510
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,080
This was registered to your dead uncle.

511
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,330
My God,I'd forgotten
all about the damn thing.

512
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,360
My uncle gave it to me for a gift.

513
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,620
A Webley .38. Bullet from
that gun ended up in Rita.

514
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,340
That gun was stolen two
months before Rita died.

515
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,630
- You never reported it.
- Look,this is ludicrous.

516
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,780
I had no reason to kill Rita.

517
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,510
She tell you she was
going to quit modeling?

518
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,720
Eh,she told me about
it,but I wasn't upset.

519
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,360
You invested a lot of money in her.

520
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,190
Would have taken a big
hit of your circulation.

521
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,870
Yeah,but I was not about to let an
asset like that walk out the door.

522
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,570
Are you decent?

523
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,560
- I used to be.
- You should lock your door,cupcake.

524
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,460
What have we got here?

525
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,880
These are fantastic.

526
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,310
Who took 'em?

527
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,250
Me.

528
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,970
Come on.Don't kid a kidder.

529
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,080
No kidding,koo koo.

530
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,290
You got more tricks up your
sleeve than Harry Houdini.

531
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,470
- I'm through with pinups,Monty.
- Thought you were having fun.

532
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,050
I'm bored of making other people smile.

533
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,540
When I take these pictures,I smile.

534
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,890
So you want to ba photographer?

535
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,240
I don't know.Maybe.

536
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,820
These are like the ones
they got in Life Magazine.

537
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,130
You could be a photojournalist,take
serious pictures.

538
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,170
You think?

539
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,720
Oh,no,n-no,Rita.

540
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,220
Uh-uh,I didn't sign you to a pinup contract
'cause I wanted your autograph,so...

541
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,830
But can't we work something out?

542
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,170
Tell you what.How'd
you like 'em published?

543
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,290
Come on.Hey,don't kid a kidder.

544
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,790
You got a real way of
understanding people.

545
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,160
I can see it in those pictures,too.

546
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,220
Now you're just trying
to sweet-talk me.

547
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:58,180
Hey,if I can't have you as a pinup girl,I
sure as hell want you as a photographer.

548
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:07,560
As talented as Rita was in front of the
camera,she was even more talented behind it.

549
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,180
Hell,I was even going to
make more money that way.

550
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,510
What a sell: "queen of the lens.”

551
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,110
Still got some of her old negatives,too.

552
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,330
I never could bring
myself to print them.

553
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,180
Who else had access to that gun,Monty?

554
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,950
I kept it locked up in a
small safe in the studio.

555
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,900
Anyone else have a key to that safe?

556
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,250
No,just Zip.Kept his
expensive lenses in there.

557
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,320
Did Zip know Rita
wanted to leave modeling?

558
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,620
I don't know,but I'll tell you one
thing-- I was-- I wasn't sad to see him go.

559
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,110
Package deal like that,I
was better off without.

560
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,830
Talking about Zip with Rita?

561
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:49,950
All that time,I thought that blowhard made her look
good till I realized it was the other way around.

562
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,350
Yes,ma'am,uh,the pictures are ready.

563
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,850
Are you aware of our two-
for-one special on 8x10s?

564
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,090
Special can wait,Zippy.

565
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,490
You remember the safe
Monty had in his studio?

566
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,860
Safe?No.

567
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,050
You should.He gave you a key to it.

568
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,200
- That's where you kept your lenses,right?
- I guess.

569
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,420
Oh,yeah,come to think of it,uh,I
stored a few of 'em in ther

570
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,460
Along with his gun.Come
to think of that?

571
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,800
No,I don't remember any gun.

572
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,170
Well,how about Rita telling
you she wanted to quit modeling?

573
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,830
- Well,that was just something she said.
- Said she wanted to become a photographer.

574
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,970
Please.

575
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,210
Taking a few snapshots and doing what
I do are two different things entirely.

576
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,680
I checked your rsum,Zip.

577
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,010
- You had a hard time getting work after Rita died.
- I loved Ree.

578
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,640
It took me a while before I
could photograph a woman again.

579
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,130
Yeah,especially since no
other magazine would hire you.

580
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,980
Barely lasted another year
as a pinup photographer.

581
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,660
- That's 'cause you were a hack.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

582
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,030
- I created Rita.
- She outgrew you,Zip.

583
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,440
No,it was a
relationship.She...she needed me.

584
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,960
She needed you to let her
go,but you just couldn't do that.

585
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,820
No.I was the photographer.

586
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,330
I mean,we had a good
thing going,the two of us.

587
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:06,460
Till she had to go and
turn everything upside down.

588
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,780
("Somewhere Along the Way"
by Nat King Cole playing)

589
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,250
These are interesting.

590
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,200
Who'd you say did this?

591
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,460
Me.

592
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,930
What do you think?

593
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,660
You want to quit modeling for this?

594
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,090
They're ugly.

595
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,520
Well,I'm...I'm just getting started.

596
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:37,140
- I'll get better.
- Stick to smiling pretty,baby.

597
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,400
Don't ruin a good thing.

598
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,370
Don't you believe in me,Zip?

599
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,590
And what about "you and me all
the way to the top of the top"?

600
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,690
We can both do it as photographers.

601
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,830
Look,I'm the photographer.

602
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,930
You're a pinup girl.

603
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,740
That's the way it is.

604
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,410
I want to take different
kinds of pictures.

605
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,460
- Like a journalist.
- Journalism takes brains.

606
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,420
Dedication.

607
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,610
No more sing-alongs in
bars behaving like a tramp.

608
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,980
My mother taught me to
sing along like that.

609
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,220
I told you that.

610
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,860
She used to dance around the
kitchen when I was a little girl,

611
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,660
singing goofy songs to me.

612
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,310
I was gonna teach our daughter
the same thing one day.

613
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,510
I don't think we want the
same things anymore,do we,Zip?

614
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,380
I think you should go.

615
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,870
I knew as soon as I saw
those photos.She was good.

616
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,910
I just couldn't admit to it at the time.

617
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,960
You couldn't handle that she
was more talented than you.

618
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,530
Instead,I was cruel.

619
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,670
And that was the last time I saw her.

620
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,750
I went to Monty's studio that
night to get my prints of Rita.

621
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,000
I knew they'd be valuable someday.

622
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,170
Took me all night to pack 'em up.

623
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,820
Anyone to back that up?

624
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:16,560
Betty Sue was there.Trying on some
of Rita's wardrobe for her date.

625
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,960
Betty Sue borrowed Rita's clothes?

626
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,830
Well,the kid didn't have any money.

627
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,510
- Do you remember if she took a purse?
- A purse?

628
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,280
For her date.Did she borrow a purse?

629
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,250
I don't know.

630
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,400
She was awful excited,though.She,uh,made
me take a picture of her.

631
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,030
You still have that picture?

632
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,960
I'm a photographer.Got a negative
of every picture I ever took.

633
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,190
Dig it up and print it.

634
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,280
Betty Sue dresses for
a night on the town.

635
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,740
You remember when that photo was taken?

636
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,880
I don't know.

637
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,220
It's at the studio.

638
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,910
Must have been a photo shoot.

639
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,610
- Oh,Zip said he took it the night Rita was killed.
- He did?

640
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,810
You were at the studio getting
ready for your big date.

641
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,750
Oh,well,I'll be.I'd forgotten.

642
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,880
You forgot a lot,Betty.

643
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,940
I been going over these pinup magazines

644
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,480
You chose Seems like a time capsule.

645
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,500
Rita's "night on the town" outfit
for your date with "Blue Eyes.”

646
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,120
Quite a trip down memory lane.

647
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,340
But what does that have
to do with Rita's murder?

648
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,300
Everything.

649
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,000
You see that purse?

650
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,970
You had it with you on your date.

651
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,920
So how does it end up
in Rita's apartment?

652
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,200
I just figured Rita
borrowed it from wardrobe.

653
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,400
- Maybe she did.
- No.No.

654
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:52,570
The only way that purse gets to this
crime scene is if you brought it.

655
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,600
I did stop by.

656
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,520
But I didn't hurt Rita.

657
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,430
I ran your fingerprints,Betty.

658
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,990
Matches the gun.

659
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,520
How did you get my fingerprints?

660
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,470
A report from the crime lab.

661
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,820
And your prints are all over
your office at St.Mary's.

662
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,070
Patriot Act.Special subpoena.We
dusted that place two nights ago.

663
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,100
I didn't have a gun.

664
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,540
You were Monty's assistant.

665
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,310
You had copies of all his keys.

666
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,850
The strip club was a dangerous place.

667
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,500
You took Monty's gun for protection.

668
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:29,610
Oh,that gun.Yes,I had it.

669
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,370
I don't know how it
got to Rita's apartment.

670
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,440
Well,your date ended early,so you
went to Rita's to talk about it.

671
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,370
Just like she made you promise.

672
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,630
Your date was at 8:00.

673
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,130
The gunshot was heard at 9:00.

674
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,270
Your date didn't go well,did it?

675
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,040
A couple drinks to numb the pain?

676
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,410
Two best friends,both
working the soda shop.

677
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:54,850
Years pass and everything goes
right for one,but the other one...

678
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:00,080
She's stuck taking care
of a drunken old man.

679
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,860
And Rita plays and dances.

680
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,230
Everything was easy for her.

681
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,620
I just wanted one day of her luck.

682
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:16,230
One day when it was easy.

683
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,510
What happened that night,Betty?

684
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,230
I've devoted my life to helping others.

685
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,130
Helping others or seeking atonement?

686
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:31,070
Someone once told me God shines his
light on those who ask for forgiveness.

687
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,740
I hope so.

688
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,450
Rita!

689
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,540
Betty?What's wrong?

690
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,890
You told me to come by after the date.

691
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,570
Here I am.

692
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,600
Sit down,Bets.You don't look too good.

693
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,680
What's that?

694
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,680
Nothing.

695
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,120
It's just another picture I took.

696
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,800
- It's of you.-
Self-portrait.

697
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,260
Monty found another magazine
that wants to publish me.

698
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,850
I had to come up with a fake name.

699
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,430
Stanley Nopell.Get it?

700
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,040
From your song.

701
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,830
Good one.

702
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,420
What's a girl gotta do to
get a drink around here?

703
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,340
Hey,hey,haven't you had enough?

704
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,270
Betty,what happened?

705
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,610
My date went real swell.

706
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,200
Sat down for drinks.

707
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,140
He was excited...

708
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,220
a little nervous.

709
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,920
Then you know happened?

710
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,860
He gave me something.

711
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,570
He did?

712
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,290
- Well what did he give you?
- This.

713
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,360
He wanted your autograph.

714
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,010
He only asked me out
so he could meet you.

715
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,150
No.No,that can't be true.

716
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,040
He came to you that night.

717
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,780
Because he was too nervous to go to you.

718
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,020
He laughed at me when he realized
I thought we were on a date.

719
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,740
Oh,Betty.

720
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,730
What's it like...

721
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,720
...to always be lucky?

722
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,120
Betty,I'm not lucky.

723
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,150
Harder I work,luckier I get.

724
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:57,340
The men at the club--
they stare,stare.

725
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,810
They never ask me for my autograph.

726
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,650
They ask me for other things.

727
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,780
Betty,you don't have to do that.

728
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,430
Come stay here with me.

729
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,320
Your dad'll be fine.

730
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,430
If I can't make old Blue
Eyes happy,then you should.

731
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,100
You make everyone happy!

732
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,350
Life's funny.

733
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,730
Ain't it,koo koo?

734
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,610
Go ahead.Sign it!

735
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,420
Betty,don't do this.

736
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,550
Sign it!

737
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,160
Sign it!

738
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,390
Betty...

739
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,890
Betty,it's me.

740
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,050
It's Ree.I'm your friend.

741
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,930
Things can change for you.

742
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,280
I started right where you did.

743
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,940
That's what hurts the most.

744
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:14,870
("Can't I" by Nat King Cole playing)

745
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:31,610
* Can't I Will I Ever love you again *

746
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:41,120
* Tell me Why then can't I *

747
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:47,730

* You might have known others *

751
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:20,850
* So have I Who would
hurt you And desert you? *

752
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:28,130
* That's why I only want To hold you *

753
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:37,720

* Tell me Why then can't I *

755
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:17,970
* You might have known others *

756
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:28,300
* So have I Who would
hurt you And desert you? *

757
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:36,890
* That's why I only want To hold you *

758
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:45,580
