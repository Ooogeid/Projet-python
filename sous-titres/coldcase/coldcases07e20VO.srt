00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,800
********

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,900
This seat taken ?

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,100
<i>"Darling be home soon"
by Joe Cocker.</i>

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,900
Where you headed ?

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,500
Ithaca.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,700
Got a transfer
in Cortland.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,600
Yeah.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,900
Yeah, me, too.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,700
It's about an hour wait.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,100
You, um, going to school there ?

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,600
Cornell.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,100
First year ?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,700
Uh, your folks
didn't drop you off ?

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,100
Dad's military.

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,900
No kidding.

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,000
Colonel.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,000
Are you, uh...
always this talkative ?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,200
You ?

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,400
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,100
<i>This is the last call for Rochester.
Leave bay four.</i>

22
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,300
Sorry

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,800
What a jerk.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,200
Whatcha reading ?

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,500
Heller. "Catch-22".

26
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,400
Is it good ?

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,200
I don't know yet.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,900
I like to get to the end
before making up my mind.

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,600
Make love,
not war, man.

30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,300
Got it.

31
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,100
A lot of that
going around campus.

32
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,000
How's it look ?

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,700
Groovy.

34
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,400
- I'm David. David Quinn.
- Annabelle Bennet.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Cornell, huh ?

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Cornell.

37
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,700
No, I'm sure
you'll be fine.

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,700
I'm an idiot,

39
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,200
telling you how scared I
am when you're going...

40
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
I hear they have great beaches
over there.

41
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,100
Besides, I'll only be gone
for a year.

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,600
<i>Last call for Cornell.</i>

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,700
Good luck.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,900
Yeah.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,300
You, too.

46
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,300
Listen, if you need
someone to write...

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,100
Come home safe...

48
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,900
tell how it ends.

49
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,700
I'll do that.

50
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,200
You'll probably forget me
as soon as you get to base.

51
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,000
No, no, I'm stubborn like that.

52
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:03,001
********

53
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,800
Why did you enter the basement
without backup, Agent Yates ?

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
A man was down.

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,300
Shepard had already taken
his wife hostage.

56
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,000
Why not wait for a
hostage negotiator ?

57
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,900
Claire Shepard was
in imminent danger.

58
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,600
There was no time to wait
for a negotiator.

59
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,400
The suspect emerged
with a facial contusion.

60
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,100
That part of the negotiation ?

61
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,900
He must have fallen.

62
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,300
After Shepard was detained,

63
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,100
did you or Detective Rush

64
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:26,801
strike him in any way ?

65
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,400
Absolutely not.

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,300
The suspect
indicated he was hit.

67
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,800
Paul Shepard murdered
nine people.

68
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,700
Feel free to add "liar"
to his résum ?

69
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,600
30 years on the job,
one thing I've learned...

70
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,900
every pat on the head

71
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:50,901
brings a knife in the back.

72
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,500
Comforting.

73
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, that's how
the game is played.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,001
Diane.

75
00:04:55,302 --> 00:04:56,602
I think you know what this is.

76
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,000
You get accolades
while I get reprimanded.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,300
SAC wants you to cool your heels
in the Applicant Squad

78
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,300
until the OPR finishes
the investigation.

79
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,900
No. I'm gonna take
some AL time instead.

80
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,800
Mom's been admitted to the hospital
back in Philly.

81
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,101
I'm sorry to hear that.

82
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,900
If there's anything I can do...

83
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,400
Thanks.

84
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,900
You watch yourself, huh ?

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,200
Detective.

86
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,500
I'd like to pick
your brain.

87
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
About what ?

88
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
Tell me, what do you know
about Woodstock ?

89
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,600
Great music, tie-dyes,
brown acid and mud.

90
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
This some kind of test ?

91
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,100
Three people died
during Woodstock.

92
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,900
One OD'd,

93
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,900
another run over by a tractor,
third was a homicide.

94
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,100
GI shot to death.

95
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,200
I'd like to get your read on it.

96
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,400
I jumped through your hoops,
let your team debrief me.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,600
- I got to get back.
- Come on, it's Friday.

98
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,700
I'll have you
back by Monday.

99
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,800
We'll get you a car,

100
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
the U.S. Marshal
will deputize you.

101
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,000
And you get to hang out
with me a little more.

102
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,900
But I don't really like you.

103
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,400
Seriously.

104
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,600
Look, I want
to see what you got.

105
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Any new information
or leads ?

106
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,500
No.

107
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,800
There must be some reason
you're looking into this now.

108
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,700
It came down from
the Director's office.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,600
I get results,
gives me a yank at HQ.

110
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,300
And this involves me how ?

111
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,300
Could mean a job for you.

112
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,401
Job ?

113
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,700
Federal Cold Case Unit.

114
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,300
Cold Case

Transcript VO : www.ragbear.com

116
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,300
Free love

117
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,600
Hold the elevator.

118
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,000
Morning.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,500
Hi.

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,100
Anybody want this ?

121
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,800
Kat ? Asked for an Americano,

122
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,400
and I got a triple macchiato
with two pumps of vanilla.

123
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,500
I detect some nutmeg.

124
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,600
You lost me at "macchiato."

125
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,300
What was that ?

126
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,900
We work together.

127
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,100
Don't mean I got to discuss
beverage choices with him.

128
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,500
Yeah, but I thought
you two had a thing going.

129
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,500
Had.

130
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,400
Moving on.

131
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,600
Decent guy,
good job, chemistry.

132
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,300
I can see why you'd want
to throw that away.

133
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,500
He's all yours.

134
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Hey, boss, French four-letter word
for "fencing sword."

135
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,500
Epée.

136
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,200
It's a three-vowel go-to word.

137
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,200
Think I'll stick to the
Word Jumble and Family Circus.

138
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,100
Restricted duty doesn't mean
you're anchored to the desk, Nick.

139
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,700
Chicken Soup
for the Soul, huh ?

140
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,300
Yeah, Mike in Patrol
said it changed his life.

141
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Megan.

142
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,300
Long time, no see.

143
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,200
Five years, Nicky.

144
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,100
Yeah.

145
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm so sorry
barging in here like this.

146
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,300
Our house
got broken into.

147
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,100
The cops came,
they didn't do anything,

148
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,500
and it's just been
a really, really bad week.

149
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,500
Yeah, have a seat.

150
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,800
So, what happened ?

151
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Well, we came home from dinner,
the guy's in the house.

152
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,500
Roy chased him away.

153
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,900
Roy, that's the husband ?

154
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,400
Ten years this July.

155
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
What's missing ?

156
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,500
Earrings and a necklace
my mother gave me.

157
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,300
She got married in them.

158
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,300
I'll see what I can do.

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Really ?

160
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,700
I got some downtime
between cases, so...

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,700
David Quinn, 20 years old.

162
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,400
Volunteered for his first tour
of duty in '68.

163
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,600
Was a spotter.
Worked with snipers.

164
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,200
Got called back...
orders to report to Fort Dix

165
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
for a second tour in '69.

166
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,800
Shot in the abdomen with a .38.

167
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,300
M.E. say when he died ?

168
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,600
Approximately
August 17--

169
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,400
last full day
of the concert.

170
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,800
Any idea how he got
to the festival ?

171
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,200
Ford Galaxie.

172
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,700
Car was never
recovered.

173
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,000
Any leads ?

174
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, here's where
the Bureau comes in.

175
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,500
Reuben Harris, founder of PRS--

176
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,800
Progressive
Revolutionary Society.

177
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,500
Some kind of anti-war
organization ?

178
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Credited with bombing
a draft board office.

179
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
Witnesses say that he

180
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,800
and David had a confrontation
first day of Woodstock.

181
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,100
So what's our beatnik
up to now ?

182
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,200
Author, professor.

183
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,900
Made a career as a guru
to the counterculture.

184
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,500
What's a strait-laced soldier doing
with half a million hippies ?

185
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,700
Let me see
that crime scene photo again.

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Zoom into that necklace.

187
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,800
She a member of PRS, too ?

188
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,000
One no last name.Daisy
in the group, no lastname.

189
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,100
Well, I got an idea
of who might know.

190
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Professor.

191
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,700
G-men get better
looking every year.

192
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,300
This is Detective Rush.

193
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,800
I'm Agent Cavanaugh.

194
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,200
Been doing some reading.

195
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,500
Well, it's always nice
to meet a fan.

196
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,000
This guy a fan, too ?

197
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,800
Witnesses say you had a conflict
at Woodstock.

198
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,600
Woodstock wasn't
about conflict.

199
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,800
It was about melding
hearts and minds.

200
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,700
How about melding your mind
to the question ?

201
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll tell you the same thing
I told the Man back in the day:

202
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm a pacifist.

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Pacifist

204
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:29,901
whose organization
bombed a draft station ?

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Terrorist Task Force
could snap on some gloves, reinvestigate.

206
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,600
I'm guessing you got
a little more to lose now, Reuben.

207
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,700
All right, maybe I had
words with that GI.

208
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,100
It doesn't mean
I laid a hand on him.

209
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,400
This about Daisy ?

210
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,800
She your girlfriend ?

211
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,900
Girlfriend ?

212
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,700
It was free love, man.

213
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,300
Only GI Joe wasn't hip
to that.

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,400
One, two, three, four !
We don't want your stinkin' war !

215
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:11,101
<i>"Something in the air"
by Thunderclap Newman.</i>

216
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,800
Annabelle ?

217
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,700
Want to know how it ends ?

218
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
David.

219
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,299
What are you doing here ?

220
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,599
I went to your dorm.

221
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,500
Your roommate said I could
find you with this group.

222
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,100
You came all this way
to find me ?

223
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,700
I told you, I'm stubborn.

224
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,700
I got called for a second tour.

225
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,000
When ?

226
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,600
Three days.

227
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,600
Hope to spend 'em with you.

228
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,700
You know this square, Daisy ?

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
He's a friend, Reuben.

230
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,900
This place is about peace,
you dig ?

231
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,799
- Just talking to a girl.
- Want to help stop the war,

232
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
you know where to find us.

233
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,599
Daisy went
to hand out pamphlets.

234
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,000
I lost her sometime between Richie Havens
and Swami Satchidananda.

235
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,599
Any idea where she went ?

236
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Well, I figured that she split
with soldier boy.

237
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,799
David called her Annabelle ?

238
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,499
Yeah, well, she was trying
to leave her past behind.

239
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,099
Annabelle have a last name ?

240
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,699
You guys got a file
a mile long on me,

241
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,400
and you're telling me
that you don't know who she is ?

242
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,499
Humor us.

243
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,900
Annabelle Bennet.

244
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,299
The honorable
congresswoman

245
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,399
from New York.

246
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,299
- Congresswoman ?
- I didn't know.

247
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,700
And your director just happens
to open the case ?

248
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,300
Listen, the director's motives
are over my pay grade.

249
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,199
Feel free to back out
any time.

250
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,900
Oh, I don't cut and run.

251
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,599
Detective Vera,
Detective Valens.

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,499
Wow. Two of you for a break-in.

253
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,999
Well, it's a slow day
for homicides.

254
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,799
Roy, honey,

255
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,699
Nick's the one I...

256
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,299
One of your high school sweethearts ?
Which one are you ?

257
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,500
The hockey player or the A/V guy ?

258
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,599
Uh, hockey. A/V guy ?

259
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I'd love to stroll down
memory lane, but...

260
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,300
Yeah. Looks like
he punched it in.

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,599
Jewelry the only thing missing ?

262
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,000
As far as I can ascertain.

263
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,200
Tell us again what you saw.

264
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,499
Well, we came
home from dinner.

265
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Wednesday's our date night.

266
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,800
Only if you promise.

267
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,200
I promise.

268
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,200
There's somebody
in the house.

269
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,100
Stay here.

270
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,100
Guess I scared him away.

271
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,199
You heard glass breaking
after Roy entered ?

272
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,899
Yes.

273
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,199
That sound right, Roy ?

274
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,599
All happened so fast.

275
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,299
Probably just a
crime of opportunity.

276
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,799
Easy there, Kojak.

277
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,200
We'll get some techs down here,

278
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,200
to dust for prints,
take some pictures of the door.

279
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,199
Hey, you can't go in there.

280
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,099
Excuse the intrusion,

281
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,400
Congresswoman.

282
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,599
So the FBI just barges in now ?

283
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,099
When you keep us
waiting an hour.

284
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,399
Should I call security, ma'am ?

285
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,999
We just need a moment
of your time.

286
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,499
Agent, do I need to get your
assistant director on the line ?

287
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,000
Sorry but, it can't wait, Daisy.

288
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,099
I chair the subcommittee
that votes on Bureau funding.

289
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,299
You think that you're the first agents
to land on my doorstep ?

290
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,199
Congresswoman,
I'm a Philly homicide detective,

291
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,300
and I could care less
about your political affiliations.

292
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,900
I'm here to solve David Quinn's
murder.

293
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,100
What happened to him ?

294
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,700
That's what we're here
to find out.

295
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,500
David cut through
500,000 people to find you.

296
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,100
Not too many guys do that.

297
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,200
He was stubborn.

298
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,000
And I was foolish enough
to believe in love at first sight.

299
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,800
No matter how much we'd changed.

300
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,300
<i>"Colours" par Donovan.</i>

301
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,000
Found your note
at the info booth.

302
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,500
How'd you like it ?

303
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,300
"Anything worth living for

304
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:39,401
is worth dying for."

305
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,000
"And anything worth dying for...

306
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
is certain worth living for."

307
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,900
I must have read it 50 times.

308
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,300
Got home, needed to
get my head straight.

309
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,600
A month turned
into two.

310
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,899
Can't imagine
what it was like.

311
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,999
You hear these stories.

312
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Whatever you've heard,
it's worse.

313
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,600
What happened to you ?

314
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,300
Well, now that
I've found you, I...

315
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,000
I'd rather not waste time
talking about it.

316
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,100
Oh, man, I think that's Joan.

317
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,799
You want her,

318
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,500
you got her. Come on.

319
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,000
Careful.

320
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,800
The most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

321
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,100
I know what you mean.

322
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,600
We're getting drenched.

323
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,500
Come on,
let's get out of here.

324
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,199
We ran until we found a barn,

325
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,500
and slept there.

326
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,200
Never met anyone else like him.

327
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,600
That's the last time
you saw David ?

328
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,600
Went to check in
with some friends the next day.

329
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,700
Um, got back, and he was gone.

330
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,199
Do you remember the name
of the farm ?

331
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,300
It was a dairy farm, I think.

332
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,500
Past a fork in the road
and a windmill.

333
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,890
I ran into some kids the next day
who told me

334
00:18:05,891 --> 00:18:07,691
they tried to shack up there.

335
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Farmer chased them off
with a gun.

336
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:14,699
What's happening ?

337
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,599
Jimmy Mota--
that piece of garbage

338
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,000
who attacked your mother.

339
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,499
Yeah ? What about him ?

340
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,600
Took a deal.

341
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,099
Three to five,
sent him to Graterford.

342
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,599
Oh, you got to
be kidding me.

343
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,100
Could be out in 18 months
on good behavior.

344
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,000
Thought you should know.

345
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,100
Yeah.

346
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,600
Thanks.

347
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,599
Prints back on
that burglary job.

348
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Most belong to the homeowners,
except for these.

349
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,899
Shelly Hewit.

350
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,099
Teaches AP math over
at Jefferson High.

351
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,689
Got an AFIS hit off her mandatory
background check and fingerprints.

352
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,699
And she's got
a few shoplifting charges

353
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,499
on her résum a couple
of years back.

354
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,999
Megan works over at Jefferson.

355
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,999
Maybe they're friends.

356
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,999
Must be special friends

357
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,300
'cause the print concentration
was on the bedposts and the headboard.

358
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,499
Pop quiz, Shelly.

359
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,000
What didn't you disclose
on your job application ?

360
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,100
Kleptomania was a by-product
of my depression.

361
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,000
My therapist said
it made me feel alive.

362
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,500
It work ?

363
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,800
Till I got caught.

364
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,399
Do you know Megan Easton ?
Teaches history.

365
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,600
Just "hi" and "bye"
in the break room.

366
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,899
Ever been to her house ?

367
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,600
No.

368
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,500
Help us out.

369
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,500
- Megan's house was broken into.
- Jewelry taken.

370
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,499
What does your therapist say

371
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,999
- about breaking and entering ?
- I didn't take that jewelry.

372
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,500
But you were in her house, right ?

373
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,799
Your prints are all over.

374
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,400
Headboard and bedposts,
to be exact.

375
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,699
See, what I can't
figure out is why

376
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,599
someone would break
into someone's house,

377
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,899
play patty-cake
with the bedposts

378
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,999
- and then just steal some jewelry.
- Okay.

379
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,500
I was in the house.

380
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,900
But not to steal.

381
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,299
What the hell
are you doing here ?

382
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,500
I've been calling.

383
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,400
You said you
were going to leave her.

384
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,299
My... my wife is outside.
Shelly, please.

385
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,099
She's probably
calling the police right now.

386
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,400
I wore something special
for you.

387
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:16,899
Look,

388
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,800
we'll say there
was a break-in, okay ?

389
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,399
The-the guy took the jewelry,

390
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,999
okay, and, uh...
and, um...

391
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,999
and I chased him away, okay ?

392
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,199
Don't you love me ?

393
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,899
Of course. Of course I do, baby.

394
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,099
Yes. Of course.

395
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,899
Of course, baby.
Look,

396
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,399
we'll go away somewhere nice.

397
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,099
- Do you mean it ?
- I promise.

398
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,499
Okay. You pack a bikini,
all right ?

399
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,399
So, let's get out of here
before the cops come, okay ?

400
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,900
Out the back.
Please, all right ?

401
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,700
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

402
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,900
"Bikini."

403
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,100
Took me to Cleveland

404
00:20:49,101 --> 00:20:51,001
for a mortgage broker conference.

405
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
Let me guess...

406
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,300
Roy still plans
on leaving his wife.

407
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,600
We're in love.

408
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,600
You keep drinking
that Kool-Aid, honey.

409
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,000
So hard to find a good guy,
you know.

410
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,400
Do you still have the jewelry ?

411
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,000
Roy wanted me to pawn it,
but I...

412
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,800
I couldn't do that to Megan.

413
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,300
Thought you could use
some company.

414
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,600
Well, I've got a U.S. News
& World Report from '07

415
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,500
and a Highlights magazine.

416
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,100
We don't have to talk.

417
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,700
What else are we going to do ?

418
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,300
I meant...

419
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
you...

420
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,300
want to be alone.

421
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,300
I get that.

422
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,500
How's your mother ?

423
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,400
Stroke.

424
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,600
They're not sure
if they caught it in time.

425
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
They let you in to see her ?

426
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,400
Didn't know what to say.

427
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,600
I mean, here's this woman
who raised me.

428
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,500
All I can see is this person

429
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,100
I spent my whole life
trying not to be like.

430
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,700
I resented her
for being a housewife.

431
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,700
Most of all, I resented

432
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:17,301
how proud she was of her life.

433
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,900
So tell me...

434
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,100
Yeah.

435
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,100
What have I got to be proud of ?

436
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,600
So this is Woodstock.

437
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,200
There's the fork
in the road.

438
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,300
Annabelle said
there was a windmill.

439
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Let's check it out.

440
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,800
Can you believe that soldier came
all the way out here to find her ?

441
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I guess he thought
she was the one.

442
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,000
What about you ?

443
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,000
What about me ?

444
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,300
Well, I just figured you
had a guy back in Philly.

445
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,400
Let me guess...

446
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:14,101
a cop.

447
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And your last girlfriend was

448
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,200
a 24-year-old paralegal, right ?

449
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,600
Twenty-five.

450
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,100
Grad student in biology.

451
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,600
And she was my fiancée.

452
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,900
What happened, she remove you
from her profile ?

453
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,800
Head-on collision

454
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:44,901
two years ago.

455
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Sorry.

456
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,700
I certainly know how
to kill a moment.

457
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,700
No, I...
it's good to know

458
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,300
who I'm lost
in the fields with.

459
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,600
We're not lost.

460
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,100
Look, there's the
barn right there.

461
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,300
Come on, we're
getting soaked.

462
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,000
You always point a gun at everyone
that comes on your property ?

463
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,400
I got a right to bear arms,

464
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,200
protect my livestock.

465
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,100
You want to tell me
what this is all about ?

466
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,500
Woodstock.

467
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,400
Milk trucks couldn't get through
for days

468
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,100
'cause all the love buses
they had blocking the roads.

469
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,800
A soldier...

470
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:41,101
David Quinn...

471
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,800
he might have stayed
in your barn ?

472
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,200
What happened to this kid ?

473
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,500
He was shot and killed.

474
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Ever own a .38 ?

475
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,200
No, ma'am,

476
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,700
just what you see there.

477
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,300
Said his name was David.

478
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,000
He was hooked up
with some of them bohemians,

479
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,900
but this kid wasn't
like the others.

480
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,300
I trusted you, Daisy.
How could you ?!

481
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,700
- Reuben, you're upset.
- You knew about Xavier.

482
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,200
You were the only one I told.

483
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:07,701
It's time for you
to beat feet, pal.

484
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,800
Baby killer's a part of it, too.

485
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,900
Admit it !

486
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,400
Stop it.

487
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,700
Stop it, David, please !

488
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,000
<i>"Piece of my heart"
by Big Brother and The Holding Company.</i>

489
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This is who you want ?

490
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,600
Reuben, wait.

491
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,000
Got to talk to him.

492
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,000
Annabelle.

493
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,200
Made a mess of my barn.

494
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,500
You think those tags
are a joke ?

495
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,600
Men die for the honor
of wearing those.

496
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,500
No, sir.

497
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,900
I earned these the hard way.

498
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,200
First Infantry.

499
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,300
Big Red One.

500
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,600
Why didn't you say so ?

501
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,600
101st Airborne.

502
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Tiger Force.

503
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,100
He helped out around the farm.

504
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,200
Bued hay, mended a fence.

505
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,800
Sounds like a good army man.

506
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,500
I wouldn't expect anything less.

507
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,700
I was in 'Nam myself.

508
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,300
Picked up a packet
of shrapnel and...

509
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,000
Damn war did a number
on all of us.

510
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,900
David ever mention this Xavier ?

511
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,300
No, he just took off
to find his girl.

512
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,300
Hey.

513
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,600
What, did you get a break
in the case ?

514
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
Sit down
before I knock you down.

515
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,100
All right, look...

516
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:41,701
I made some mistakes.

517
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,700
Save it,

518
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,901
and before you try and
throw Shelly under the bus,

519
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,500
I know the whole
break-in thing was your idea.

520
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,000
No, i-it wasn't my idea.

521
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,000
Look, things just
got out of hand.

522
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,200
What got out of hand

523
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,800
was you banging your
girlfriend in Megan's house.

524
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,600
Oh, I get it.

525
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,100
What, you still got
a thing for Megan, huh?

526
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,500
Listen to me, scumbag.

527
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,300
You got one shot
to make this right.

528
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,600
You take that jewelry and
you get it back to Megan

529
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,600
and you tell her the truth.

530
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,600
You remember what that is,
right ?

531
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,800
Now, get out of here
before I lose my appetite.

532
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,400
Here.

533
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,600
I got it.

534
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,500
You want to run it
under hot water...

535
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,700
...tap it and twist.

536
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,200
You with the advice.

537
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,100
Veronica has been seeing
her dad every other weekend.

538
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,300
Not my place.

539
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,300
Actually,

540
00:28:02,701 --> 00:28:03,901
she seems...

541
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,400
happy.

542
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,100
That's good.

543
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,100
Here.

544
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,200
Come on, give it up.

545
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,000
I might have underestimated you.

546
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,800
Well, wouldn't be the first time.

547
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,300
It never sat right...

548
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:31,601
the way we left things.

549
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,100
Well, you went to New York.

550
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,700
I didn't want to be the gal who slept
around the department.

551
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,100
Is that how it was ?

552
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,800
Come on, John.

553
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,300
We wound up together...

554
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,400
any promotion I got
would have been suspect.

555
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,700
Never thought of it that way.

556
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,100
Men don't have to.

557
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,300
I wanted to be taken seriously.

558
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,500
Did you find
what you were looking for ?

559
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,300
Yeah, I thought I did.

560
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Now they're going
to take that from me.

561
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,200
- 'Cause of the Shepard case ?
- I don't retire,

562
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
they're going to just
pack me up to Anchorage.

563
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,600
You gonna go back to New York ?

564
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,800
Don't know what's going
to be left for me here in Philly.

565
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
What do you got ?

566
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,800
Lenny "Xavier" Franklin...

567
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,700
Reuben's second
in command...

568
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,600
was arrested two days prior
to Woodstock

569
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:32,301
for attempting to bomb
a courthouse.

570
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,700
This from the PRS file ?

571
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,000
COINTELPRO.

572
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,400
Back in the day,
we had a rat in every camp.

573
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,600
You're saying someone clued
the FBI in on Lenny's plan ?

574
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,700
Bureau safeguards
the informant's identity

575
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:44,901
by assigning them a series
of classified numbers.

576
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,000
So who has access
to these numbers ?

577
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,300
Well, the informant's handler
and supervisor...

578
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,700
...and now us.

579
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,500
Meet RM#157268.

580
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,200
Annabelle wasn't a hippie chick.

581
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,900
She was working undercover
for the Bureau.

582
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,100
So she was informing
on Reuben.

583
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,600
Could be David got in the middle.

584
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,800
This comes out, our liberal
congresswoman's image

585
00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:08,901
will be tarnished for good.

586
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,300
Welcome to the FBI.

587
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,100
Narcotics.

588
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,900
- What ?
- The cop, guy in Philly...

589
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,100
he's...

590
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:23,901
undercover somewhere.

591
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,100
Yeah, just the way it is.

592
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,700
And...

593
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:32,701
I'm sorry about your fiancée.

594
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,700
You know, in some ways,

595
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,100
you remind me a lot of Yates.

596
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,300
Well, without the...

597
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,200
chip on her shoulder ?

598
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,900
And the foot in her mouth.

599
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,100
You'd make a good agent.

600
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,600
Two more beers.

601
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,400
- All right.
- All right.

602
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,400
Then I say...
Hold on a second.

603
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,300
Lose something ?

604
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,400
No, no.

605
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,800
Yeah. The keys.

606
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,400
I'm sure they're back
in the restaurant.

607
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Uh, they're right there.

608
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,400
No.

609
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,300
Okay, let's see,

610
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,000
uh, wet roads
this time of the evening.

611
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,900
Ah, I'd say it'll take AAA
about three hours to get here.

612
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,100
You know, I had a blind date once

613
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:26,201
who locked his keys in the car on purpose

614
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,200
because he thought he'd
spend more time with me.

615
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,100
Oh, yeah ?

616
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Did it work ?

617
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Careful.

618
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,200
Maybe we shouldn't drive.

619
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,500
Yeah.

620
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,800
Gambling with your career,
you better be damn sure

621
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,900
you know what you're doing.

622
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,200
Feeling lucky,

623
00:32:14,401 --> 00:32:16,101
like I have the winning numbers.

624
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,800
157268.

625
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,300
Sound familiar ?
Your old informant ID.

626
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,400
Here's another number
for you--

627
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
FD-395-

628
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,200
FBI Advice of Rights form--

629
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,800
just in case we have to arrest you
at the conclusion of this interview.

630
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,600
Perhaps I need to speak
to my lawyer.

631
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,800
Well, that's
your prerogative.

632
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,100
Of course, the press might
have her file by then.

633
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,600
Left wing Democrat informing
on an anti-war organization ?

634
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,400
That's a front-page
scandal.

635
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,400
I got busted for pot in my dorm.

636
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,900
The FBI saw an opening.

637
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,100
Promised me they could get
the charges erased.

638
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,500
If you informed on Reuben
and his organization?

639
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,000
I didn't want
to disappoint my father again.

640
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,700
What happened after
you left Reuben ?

641
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,900
Did you see David again ?

642
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,600
Truth is, I was lost.

643
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,300
Only thing that made sense
was him.

644
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,100
That guy, Reuben...

645
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
you love him ?

646
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,400
I got people in trouble.

647
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Narced on Reuben,
his friends.

648
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
Betrayed him.

649
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,800
Why ?

650
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,600
Had no choice.

651
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,500
At least that's what I thought.

652
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,700
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

653
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,400
You know, the other night
with you...

654
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,300
that's the first night
I've slept in a year.

655
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,800
I did things over there...

656
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,000
things I can't ever undo.

657
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,700
You had to survive.

658
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,000
I fulfilled my obligation.

659
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,900
Volunteered
the first time.

660
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,300
I don't want to go back.

661
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,700
That farmer, uh...

662
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,200
he's going to buy my old beater.

663
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
And the money will be enough
to get us to Canada.

664
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
You're asking me
to run away with you ?

665
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,100
We can start all over.

666
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,600
Get things back
to like they were on the bus.

667
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,800
- It's not that simple.
- Yes.

668
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,400
Yes, it is.

669
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,300
Wait for me here.

670
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,300
I don't know, David.

671
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,300
It's okay.

672
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,400
I do.

673
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:40,801
<i>"Get together"
by The Youngbloods.</i>

674
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,700
I waited around
a couple of hours

675
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,600
until I realized
how crazy it all was.

676
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,400
David came back for you.

677
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,800
I don't understand.

678
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,100
He crawled
through the woods

679
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,500
and died under that tree.

680
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,700
I had a chance.

681
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,200
I didn't take it.

682
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,400
I never felt that way again.

683
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,600
Director instructed us to keep
your involvement

684
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:16,901
out of the press.

685
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,100
Thank you.

686
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,300
Hey, Jimmy,
give us a minute.

687
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,300
What's up ?

688
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,000
- You talk to Roy ?
- About what ?

689
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,700
That son of a bitch.

690
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,400
Is this about the break-in
or Roy ?

691
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,900
He's cheating on you, Meg.

692
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,400
The investigation
took a turn, and it...

693
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,300
turns out he's having an affair.

694
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,400
Who is it ?

695
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
Does it matter ?

696
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,600
What does the break-in have
to do with my husband cheating ?

697
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,900
She was there that night.

698
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,100
I'll spare you
the details,

699
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,700
but long story short,
your...

700
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,200
genius husband staged
that robbery to cover it up.

701
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,500
Guess I should have
seen it coming.

702
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,900
I want to know
who you were texting

703
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,000
It was business.

704
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,600
Business that couldn't wait ?

705
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,700
The-the Peterson deal
is cratering.

706
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,100
Can we go inside
and talk this out ?

707
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,200
Talk what out ?

708
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,600
Look,

709
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,000
don't want to fight
anymore, baby.

710
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,900
Please.

711
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,500
How about we go
away next weekend ?

712
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,700
I'll leave my phone at home.

713
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,600
Only if you promise.

714
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,700
I promise.

715
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,900
There's somebody
in the house.

716
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,100
Stay here.

717
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,700
I just...

718
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,500
kept thinking
he was going to change.

719
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,100
You can't blame yourself here.

720
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,300
Nothing's turned out
like I thought.

721
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,200
What am I supposed to do now?

722
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,900
For starters,
you get rid of that bum.

723
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,400
I'm 40 years old.

724
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,600
Tough just to...

725
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:19,501
start over.

726
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,400
Things haven't gone exactly according to plan
for me, either, so...

727
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,200
Oh, Nicky.

728
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,000
Never even asked
how you're doing.

729
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,800
Hey, you can't be in here.

730
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,800
Got a sneak and
peek warrant.

731
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,200
We're taking
a quick look around.

732
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,400
I already told you,

733
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,700
I had no beef with that soldier.

734
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,200
I've got nothing but respect
foanybody that served.

735
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,600
See, that's what we
don't get, Al.

736
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,600
Why is a respectful vet
like yourself

737
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,700
getting into fights
with other GIs?

738
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,500
I don't know
what you're talking about.

739
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Well, it says here you got into
a brawl at an anti-war rally,

740
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,600
brained a Veteran Against
the War with a tire iron.

741
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Those men turned
against their own.

742
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,700
- Like David ?
- Hey. Listen.

743
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,000
He...
Was going to run off to Canada.

744
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,700
He helped me out,
and he left.

745
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,300
Well, then, how do
you explain this ?

746
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,500
It's a Ford Galaxie.

747
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,200
David Quinn's car.

748
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,700
Looked at your
army records, Al.

749
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,800
Wounded in A Shau.

750
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Board decided you
weren't fit for duty,

751
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,800
dismissed you.

752
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,300
But you wouldn't give up.

753
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,600
I can drive a tractor
sunup to sundown,

754
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,300
plow 800 acres of open fields,
and I'm not fit ?

755
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,600
David was fit for duty,

756
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,700
but he didn't want
to fight anymore.

757
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Look, you got to understand,
I would...

758
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,300
I would have died to go back.

759
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,200
I tried to tell that kid,
but he...

760
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
- he wouldn't listen.
- Tell him what?

761
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,400
How much I love my country.

762
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,100
I couldn't understand how
another soldier

763
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:58,101
would betray it.

764
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,600
Going through my stuff ?

765
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,800
Says you're due back
at Fort Dix at 0600.

766
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,300
Didn't tell me you
were going back to 'Nam.

767
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,300
Gonna hitch a ride
back to base.

768
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,800
Got the money for my car ?

769
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,600
Do you one better,
I'll give you a lift.

770
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,300
No, really, don't sweat it.

771
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,100
I insist.

772
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,600
I'm not looking
for a problem here.

773
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,900
You a coward, boy ?

774
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,300
What, are you... you going
to force me to go back ?

775
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,200
You have a duty.

776
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
A duty to what ? War ?

777
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,300
You must have
seen stuff, too.

778
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,100
What are you talking about ?

779
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,900
Oh, come on, man.
Tiger Force.

780
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,600
Lurps.

781
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,200
You were up close and personal.

782
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,500
You u n't know what I saw.

783
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,400
Know what I saw ?

784
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Children...

785
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,300
ripped apart by bullets,

786
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,400
women dragged into...

787
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,200
into huts to do God knows what.

788
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Things I can't... I can't
get out of my head.

789
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,500
A little girl screaming
in her... in her dead mother's arms.

790
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,300
- Shut up.
- Grip so tight, I have to...

791
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,000
have to break her forearm
just to get her free.

792
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,300
Shut up! Shut up!

793
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,500
I don't want to see that face
in my dreams anymore.

794
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,200
My girl's waiting.

795
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,900
You got to go.

796
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,100
- Honor your commitment !
- Why ?

797
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,300
Why ? Why do I
got to go, huh ?

798
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,200
Tell me why !

799
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:10,099
<i>"The weight" by The Band.</i>

800
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,300
* I pulled in to Nazareth

801
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,400
* Was feeling
about half past dead *

802
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,800
* I just need some place

803
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,400
* Where I can lay my head

804
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,600
* "Hey, mister,
can you tell me" *

805
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,600
* "Where a man
might find a bed?" *

806
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,600
* He just grinned
and shook my hand *

807
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,800
* "No," was all he said

808
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,900
* Take a load off, Fanny *

809
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,100
* Take a load for free *

810
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,700
* Take a load off, Fanny *

811
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,700
* And...
* And... *
* And... *

812
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,400
* You put the load right on me
* You can put the load
right on me *

813
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
* I picked up my bag

814
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,600
* I went looking
for a place to hide *

815
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,100
* When I saw Carmen

816
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,900
* And the Devil walking
side by side *

817
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,000
* I said, "Hey, Carmen"

818
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,900
* "Come on, let's go downtown" *

819
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,000
* She said, "I got to go"

820
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,800
* "But my friend
can stick around" *

821
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,200
* Take a load off, Fanny *

822
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
* Take a load for free *

823
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
* Take a load off, Fanny

824
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,100
* And...
* And... *
* And... *

825
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,800
* You put the load right on me
* You can put the load
right on me *

826
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,200
* Go down, Miss Moses

827
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,900
* There's nothing you can say *

828
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,100
* It's just old Luke *

829
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,300
* And Luke's waiting
on the Judgment Day *

830
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,200
* "Well, Luke, my friend"

831
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,400
* "What about young Anna Lee ?"

832
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,200
* He said,
"Do me a favor, son" *

833
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,300
* "Won't you stay
and keep Anna Lee company?" *

834
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,600
* Take a load off, Fanny

835
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,000
* Take a load for free

836
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,100
* Take a load off, Fanny

837
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,300
* And... and... and... *

838
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,600
* You put the load right on me
* You can put the load right on me. *
