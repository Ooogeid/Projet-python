<font color=#38B0DE>the following story is fictional

00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,000
<i>"Are You Havin' Any Fun"
by Tony Bennett.</i>

00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,940
<i>1.30.1958</i>

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,660
How'd you fare down at
Fort Benning, Mr. Bellowes ?

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,130
Held my own, sir.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,550
Managed two degrees
inside of five years.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,130
Studied straight through the
summers, thanks to the GI Bill.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,460
All while working part-time over

9
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:23,561
at Dexter Broadman Advertising,
I see.

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,440
I joined their creative
side full-time after Wharton.

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,760
I'm surprised you want

12
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:31,661
to write ads for
our little family operation.

13
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,190
Well, I'm not one for
three-martini lunches, sir.

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,590
I have bigger ideas,
and I know how to seel them.

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,690
Such as ?

16
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,750
Well, Mr. Kemp, there's a housing
shortage here in Philly.

17
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,030
I came out of the service with
Uncle Sam backing my first mortgage

18
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,150
and not a patch of ground in this city
to plant my flag,

19
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:48,751
and I am not alone.

20
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,350
I don't want to build high-rises.

21
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,380
I'm talking about houses, sir.

22
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,710
Neighborhoods of good men
and their families.

23
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,850
I want to make you the
Henry Ford of housing.

24
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,040
How exactly do you plan
to do that ?

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,350
Well, I'd like to show you.

26
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,050
You're gonna have to
take a ride with me.

27
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,600
Last summer, blight wrecked the corn and
potato crops as far as the eye can see.

28
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,590
There's 5,500 acres
sitting in the bargain bin.

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,850
Get to the point, son.

30
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,060
Cities are crowded, dirty...
built on grids.

31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,880
Out here, the streets'll be
peaceful, winding,

32
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:28,781
named after colleges,
flowers, pretty girls.

33
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,530
Picture them lined
with ranch-style houses.

34
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,820
Out front, a bright-green
yard and an apple tree.

35
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,720
We'll run a print campaign.

36
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,910
We'll-we'll open a...
a showroom with plenty of fanfare,

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,350
and we'll call it...

38
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:45,551
Libertyville.

39
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,130
And when the good people of
Libertyville want groceries,

40
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,960
a haircut or, God forbid, a school...

41
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:52,761
We build those, too !

42
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,440
Shopping plazas with
plenty of parking.

43
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,900
Recreation centers where
kids can play baseball.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,650
It'll be a whole new
way of life :

45
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:01,251
the suburbs.

46
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,590
Any thoughts on financing
this boondoggle ?

47
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,860
They'll buy on spec.

48
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,550
Home ownership... is the cornerstone
of the American dream.

49
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,330
It is what makes a man a man.

50
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,950
You trust me, sir.

51
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,440
We will sell out before
we break ground.

52
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,530
Lilly, this is Mrs. Chisholm.

53
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,500
She's got information on a murder
victim found out in Somerton in '58.

54
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,080
I'm Detective Rush.

55
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,500
Hello. Thank you.

56
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,080
His name was Julian Bellowes.

57
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,500
Met him when I first
started out as a maid.

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Gracious young man.
Worked for Harrison Kemp.

59
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,010
Married the boss's daughter.

60
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,660
Harrison Kemp built Libertyville, big
suburban development in Somerton.

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,590
Is that where you met him ?

62
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,000
No. The Kemps were members of
the Senators Club in Center City.

63
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,420
That's where I worked.

64
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,000
Place is a real "Who's Who".

65
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,140
The thing is, they said Julian
was killed out in the boonies,

66
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,670
but I think it happened
right there at the club.

67
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,071
Why is that ?

68
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,900
The night before
they found Julian,

69
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:42,801
I was on my way to clean
the Legacy Room

70
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,930
after one of
Mr. Kemp's business meetings

71
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:47,731
when I saw Julian go back inside.

72
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,110
As soon as the door closes,
a fight break out.

73
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,590
All kinds of yelling, glass breaking.

74
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,440
- What'd you do ?
- Ran for help.

75
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,150
Nobody around.

76
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,750
I got back... didn't hear a peep.

77
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,690
So I looked inside.

78
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,850
Never saw a meeting end like that.

79
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,450
You know who else was
in there ?

80
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,240
Got a list.

81
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,510
Been thinking about it 50 years.

82
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,790
You tell your boss ?

83
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,820
He said,
"Clean up and shut up"

84
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:36,321
if I wanted to keep my job.

85
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,880
Mrs. Chisholm, why did you
wait so long to come forward ?

86
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,590
Just saw my doctor.

87
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,250
Time to get my house in order.

88
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,090
If walls could talk,
I'm thinking these wouldn't.

89
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,320
The manager says the room has
barely changed in the last 50 years.

90
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,510
Picking up on a theme here.

91
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,810
Mary said Julian walked
through the door

92
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:04,611
to find his killer waiting.

93
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,150
Guy approaches.
They get into it.

94
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,820
Couple of swings right here.

95
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,310
Somebody... crashes into this.

96
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,200
The glass Mary said
she heard breaking.

97
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,100
This panel's different.

98
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:22,001
Been replaced with safety glass.

99
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,140
Old leaded stuff breaks in shards,

100
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,041
would have crashed down.

101
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,770
Evidence from 50 years ago...
is hard to come by.

102
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,160
Unless it has a place to hide.

103
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,450
I got it.

104
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,710
Walls may not talk, but the
floor's got something say.

105
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,510
Residue... could be blood.

106
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,950
Mary's right.

107
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,130
Whatever ended in that field
started right here.

108
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,340
Cold Case
season 6 Episode 19

109
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,060
Transcript VO : www.ydy.com

110
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,550
Libertyville

111
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,560
"Libertyville.
The American dream called home.

112
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,020
Some American dream.

113
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,870
34-year-old Julian Bellowes,

114
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,671
throat slit out
in the middle of nowhere.

115
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,260
My aunt and uncle were
Libertyville pioneers.

116
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,520
One night my Uncle Don has too much to
drink and walks into the wrong house.

117
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,550
They all looked exactly alike.

118
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,290
The wife... Caroline Kemp.
Handsome couple.

119
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,110
ME says the victim's injury

120
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:11,311
was caused by
a serrated blade or glass.

121
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,310
The evidence you found in the Legacy
Room could be our murder weapon.

122
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,550
So, he's killed at the club, then
moved 15 miles to Libertyville ?

123
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,080
No I-95 back then. Somerton
was an hour's drive away.

124
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,440
Felt like another planet.

125
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,100
Couple of locals reported
a drifter.

126
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:26,101
Victim's wallet was missing.

127
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,650
Assigned was thinking robbery.

128
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,440
A robbery on a farm
in the middle of nowhere ?

129
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:30,841
How's that happen ?

130
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,560
Julian's headed out there for
business, picks up this drifter.

131
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,650
Car was found near the body.

132
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,200
Let's see if the lab can get a DNA sample
from his wedding band,

133
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:41,201
compare it to the glass samples
we gave 'em.

134
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,190
Anything from the list
Mary Chisholm gave us ?

135
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,730
Maybe.
Um, two people stood out.

136
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,380
Angelo Romano and his son Paul.

137
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,790
Yep.Those Romanos.

138
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,210
Active family in construction business.

139
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:55,911
Slit throat, could have been mop hit.

140
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,660
Is that all we got ?

141
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,390
Julian's at the Senators Club
night before his body's found;

142
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,020
Kemps are lifelong members there;

143
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:05,221
and not a single statement
from the place ?

144
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,900
No interviews with the
victim's family, either.

145
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,200
Why is this box so light ?

146
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,980
Good question, Lil. Let me know
when you find out.

147
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,310
Well, I have to admit
I was surprised by your call.

148
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,000
The police didn't seem to pay attention
when my husband was killed,

149
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:30,301
never mind 50 years later.

150
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,580
Hope to make up for that
the second time around.

151
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,390
My mother was only 22
when he was killed.

152
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:37,191
She was pregnant with me.

153
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,720
Completely distraught and...

154
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:42,321
not much use to the investigation,
I'm afraid.

155
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,070
Oh, it was... it was a difficult time.

156
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,620
There's no interviews from
your husband's coworkers or family.

157
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,720
Cops ever talk to you ?

158
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,100
Only to tell me that Julian
had been murdered by a drifter.

159
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,210
Your father was Julian's boss.

160
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,680
Any idea why he wouldn't
have given a statement?

161
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,510
Are you saying there was
some sort of misconduct ?

162
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,240
No, we got some... blanks to fill is all.

163
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,290
Well, Julian was estranged
from his family.

164
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,630
He was close with mine.

165
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:11,431
I guess silence was
my family's way of... of grieving.

166
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,780
We' got a witness came forward.

167
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,670
Heard your husband in a fight at the
Senators Club night before he died.

168
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,640
He was at the club for a
business meeting with these men.

169
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,000
Recognize any of them ?

170
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,850
Well... there's... Paul Romano.

171
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,830
Isn't he the guy you were
dating when you met Daddy ?

172
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,990
A romance cultivated chiefly to
drive my father around the bend.

173
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,890
No, it all changed the
moment I saw Julian.

174
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,430
Three's a crowd ?

175
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,830
Paul didn't have a chance.

176
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,900
<i>"It Looks Like Love"
by Dean Martin.</i>

177
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,990
Cocktail ?

178
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,090
Paul, not here.

179
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,540
It's my father's birthday,
for heaven's sake.

180
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,340
So let's take a walk.

181
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,020
He's gonna be 60 all year, right ?

182
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,060
Maybe you'd like
some champagne instead ?

183
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,260
I thought I'd die of thirst.

184
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,940
I hate to think of you being neglected.

185
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,960
Think I can look after
my own date.

186
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:15,761
Not from where I'm standing.

187
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,390
Well, Paul doesn't cha-cha.

188
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,150
Well, then he won't mind warming
the bench now, will you, sport ?

189
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,250
- Caroline.
- Daddy.

190
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,170
This is Julian Bellowes.

191
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,260
I see he beat me
to an introduction.

192
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,710
You're the "Ivy League genius"

193
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:32,411
my father's been raving about ?

194
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,890
I was picturing Coke-bottle glasses.

195
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,810
Well, I could go home and
get 'em, if you'd like.

196
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,100
Julian grew up a stone's throw
from Rittenhouse Square,

197
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:44,201
graduated Wharton.

198
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,810
We have so much to talk about.

199
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,220
Then shall we ?

200
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,760
Julian made me feel like I
was the only woman in the room.

201
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,110
We were engaged a month later.

202
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,720
I take it Paul wasn't too happy
with your whirlwind romance.

203
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,450
Oh, he was angry, all right.
- So angry

204
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:15,051
he slashed Daddy's tires
that night in the parking lot, right ?

205
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,010
Julian was too much of a
gentleman to call the police.

206
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,720
Caroline Kemp. She was a catch.

207
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,260
If you're into debutante types.

208
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,830
Saying you didn't mind Julian Bellows
making tracks with her ?

209
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,480
Making tracks ?

210
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,790
The girl was a prude.

211
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,070
My dog Snowflake

212
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,871
had a better sex life than I did
when I was going with her.

213
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,650
So, why did you slash his tires ?

214
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,500
Big difference between slashing
Goodyears and killing someone.

215
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,650
Yeah, except Julian's throat
was slashed, too.

216
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,350
You making some kind
of implication ?

217
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,030
You got anger management
issues with the guy,

218
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,900
and I got a witness that puts you at a
meeting with him the night before he's dead.

219
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,160
That's circumstantial.

220
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,240
Here's a circumstance for you.

221
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,830
Hear Romano Construction
specializes in cement shoes.

222
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,070
We start sniffing around your sites,

223
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:05,971
we gonna find a body fresher
than '58 ?

224
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,720
Truth is... I felt bad for the kid.

225
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,540
Getting in bed with
that Protestant family ?

226
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,480
You meet those people ?

227
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,010
They give you frostbite
just looking at you...

228
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,240
30% off the top of my
housing sales is unacceptable.

229
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,970
That's even more than last year.

230
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:32,180
We been supplying you quality
building materials over 16 years.

231
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,420
Without Romano Construction,
you're nothing but blueprints.

232
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,100
Capasso Brothers in Camden
is offering us a better price

233
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:39,501
with no profit share.

234
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,890
The Capassos don't care about
your safety the way I do.

235
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,930
We accept your offer.

236
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,860
What ?

237
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,780
Now listen here, Bellowes.

238
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,810
- Dad, he can't just come in here...
- No, Harry. Not now.

239
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,680
Go ahead.

240
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,060
We'll pay your cut on
our builds in town

241
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:12,761
in exchange for complete control
of our profits in Somerton.

242
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,820
Somerton ?

243
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,860
What, now you're going
to sell horse manure ?

244
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,160
You got a deal.

245
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:30,030
Keep your spazzatura
farmland and God bless.

246
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,390
For the Romanos,
family is everything.

247
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,550
But not those people.

248
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:45,651
Kemp... he didn't even know
his son left the room.

249
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,330
So, Julian was squeezing Harry
out of the family business ?

250
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,080
Kid had the golden touch.

251
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,700
That, uh, farmland up in Somerton ?

252
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,480
That's Libertyville now.

253
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,200
My father gets his cut,

254
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:59,201
we'd be havin' this chat
on my own private island.

255
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,770
You ever see Harry and
Julian getting into it ?

256
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,670
I saw Harry eating
his heart out plenty,

257
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:09,571
but it took Julian dying for Harry
to get his seat back at the table.

258
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,650
Can I help you ?

259
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,070
Philly Homicide.

260
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:27,071
Thought we'd congratulate you
on your promotion to Vice President.

261
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,680
50 years late. 1960.

262
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,890
'58, actually.

263
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,610
November 30th. According to the piece
we found ???? "Philly business week".

264
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,380
What this is about ?

265
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,070
Your brother in law, Julian Bellowed ?

266
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:42,371
His murder, your big break,
only three weeks apart.

267
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,540
Where were you, night before
his body was found ?

268
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,980
I don't remember.
To be honest,

269
00:14:45,981 --> 00:14:47,781
I lost a couple of years
in there.

270
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,990
Two of you get along all right ?

271
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,690
Sure. He was my brother-in-law.
Family, don't you know ?

272
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,390
Right. So, any chance you were
with him at the Senators Club ?

273
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,930
That's where he was.

274
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,630
Uh... Told you I don't remember.

275
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,060
Look at this. November 6, 1958.

276
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,580
Got your autograph on a bar tab
signe at midnight,

277
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:07,081
same time a witness heard Julian
fighting with someone

278
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:08,182
in the Legacy Room.

279
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,050
That much gin will rot
your gut, Harry.

280
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,870
- Does other things too...
- I don't know where you're going with this.

281
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,210
Julian made us a fortune.

282
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:17,211
What was good for Kemp and Sons
was good for me.

283
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,230
Well, the guy leapfrogs you
to Vice President,

284
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,130
gets tagd "Ivy League genius"
by your father,

285
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,770
and negotiates deals while you're...

286
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:25,471
stammering on the sidelines.

287
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,080
That good for you ?

288
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,650
Slipping down the food chain

289
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:30,451
like a clown on a Vaseline pole ?

290
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,390
Well, my ego got a little bruised,
but I got over it.

291
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,330
Besides, Julian did far worse
to others.

292
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:40,831
<i>"Oh, look at me now."
by Franck Sinatra.</i>

293
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,930
So, we should have a contract
in hand in under 15 minutes.

294
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:45,231
Thanks you very much.

295
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,080
There's ladies in tears
over the picture windows.

296
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,350
Raw farmland, but they can
already imagine the fruit trees.

297
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,570
Give the people what they want,
they stand in line for it, Harrison.

298
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,190
You think if we make you our
vice president of sales,

299
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,191
I can get you to call me Dad ?

300
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,990
You're engaged to my daughter,
after all.

301
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,310
- I'd be honored... Dad.
- Take your pick.

302
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,240
You and Caroline are going to need
more room once you start a family.

303
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,490
Early wedding present.

304
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,020
Bunch of thieves stole my land !

305
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:15,421
Been in my family over 200 years !

306
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,810
Julian Bellowes, Kemp and Sons.

307
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,220
Save the sales pitch, mister.

308
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,440
Con man ! Convinced my senile old
granddad to sign on the dotted line.

309
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,770
Don't believe a word he says.

310
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,350
If it is land you want,
it is land you'll get.

311
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,920
Please.

312
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,670
Please, let me see
what I can do for you.

313
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,530
Julian was trying to make it right.

314
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,290
I mean, charming, full of ideas...
Those attributes were lost on that hick.

315
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,550
Old McDonald got a name ?

316
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,930
Julian negotiated the deal.

317
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,380
And you decided not to tell the cops
about this incident,

318
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:52,781
even when Julian shows up dead
in the same neck of the woods ?

319
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,580
We were selling houses on spec.

320
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,460
If people thought we were robbing
farmers of their land,

321
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:02,761
it would have decimated sales.

322
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,900
Tracked down the families who
sold their land to Kemp and Sons.

323
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,980
Casey Hollenbeck filed a complaint
with the Better Business Bureau.

324
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,340
Arrested in '62 for
disorderly conduct.

325
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,670
Guy spent his life raising and
slaughtering livestock

326
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:17,171
so,he would have known his way
around a knife.

327
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,330
Lived two miles from where
Julian's body was found.

328
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,340
You check out any of those
Libertyville homes

329
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:22,641
while you were out there, Nick ?

330
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,570
Matter of fact,saw a few
"for sale" signs.

331
00:17:24,571 --> 00:17:26,071
Might look into it...

332
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,100
Well, interest rates are low...
Time to act is now.

333
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,760
Where is this Casey Hollenbeck
today ?

334
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,390
Died in '94.

335
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,950
I'm looking for anyone who might
have seen him at Julian's office.

336
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,870
Julian's secretary still around ?

337
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,700
Yeah, Joan Rasky.
On her way in now.

338
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,880
Lab report's back.

339
00:17:41,881 --> 00:17:45,381
DNA from the glass in the heating vent
doesn't match Julian.

340
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,800
- Working on whose it might be.
- You have a swab from Harry ?

341
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,840
Paul Romano,too.

342
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,050
What ? I'm not going to sit
in the corner and knit.

343
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,180
Pace yourself, Will. I don't
want you busting a stitch.

344
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,210
Got Julian's bank records.

345
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,270
Guy wrote over $2,000
worth of checks to cash.

346
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,320
100 bucks a week, every week
leading up to his murder.

347
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,610
2,000 clams.
That's a lot of cash back then.

348
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,150
Gambling, mistress, drugs.

349
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,870
Or a payoff.

350
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,650
I worked with Mr. Bellowes

351
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:20,551
from February of '58
until he passed away that November.

352
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,000
A farmer out of Somerton,
Casey Hollenbeck,

353
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:26,401
had a gripe with Julian.

354
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,300
Did he ever show up
at Julian's office ?

355
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,510
Angry as sin.

356
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,860
But Mr. Bellowes patched
it up with him, of course.

357
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,080
How did he do that ?

358
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,020
Well, he just explained that the city
was sprawling north,

359
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:40,821
whether he liked it or not,

360
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,760
and he set his whole family
up in Libertyville homes.

361
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,580
We found weekly checks
made out to cash 

362
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:48,581
in his personal records.

363
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,270
Any chance Julian
was paying him off ?

364
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,980
You know, I really don't have any information
about his personal accounts, Detective.

365
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,660
Julian's gone, Joan,

366
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:04,761
and the person who killed him
might still be out there.

367
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,250
I put those checks in the mail
once a week,

368
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:17,851
but not to a Mr. Hollenbeck.

369
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,150
They were addressed
to an R. Reynolds.

370
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,610
Any idea who that was ?

371
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,070
I didn't know, and I didn't ask.

372
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,880
And then, one day,
the answer came walking in.

373
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,600
I'm here to see Mr. Bellowes.

374
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,120
Your name ?

375
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,840
Mrs. Regina Reynolds.

376
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,950
I'm sorry, Mrs. Reynolds.
Do you have an appointment ?

377
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,750
It's urgent.

378
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,970
Mr. Bellowes is behind closed doors
at the moment.

379
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,070
Well, you can let Mr. Bellowes know
I am not one for causing a scene,

380
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,771
but I am happy to give it a whirl.

381
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,700
There's a woman here
to see you, Mr.Bellowes.

382
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,220
She's,... a Negro.

383
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,930
What are you doing here ?
We have an agreement.

384
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,960
- This can't wait.
- Now is not the time.

385
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,990
I'll call you.

386
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,050
I promise.

387
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,870
So, you can imagine the scandal
in 1958.

388
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,770
Do you happen to remember the
address you sent those checks to ?

389
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:51,140
I do. I typed it so many times
it's in the permanent file.

390
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,920
2221 Robman Street.

391
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,660
Sorry I'm late.

392
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,080
Thanks for joining me.

393
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,250
Figured, as long as I was going
to be in Philly,

394
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,051
Well... I can't pass up Chinese.

395
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,510
Remember this place ?

396
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,400
Brought you here when
you were a kid.

397
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,550
Used to have an aquarium
by the door.

398
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,930
Oh, with the angelfish.

399
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,340
Christmas. We would come
here at Christmastime.

400
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,480
Red lanterns...

401
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:26,581
close as we were going
to get to decorations.

402
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,730
Still love the holidays.

403
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,920
Yeah. Sure.

404
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,370
You know,she didn't mess it all up.

405
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,530
One year, I was six...

406
00:21:48,931 --> 00:21:52,031
well, we skipped the Chinese,
but not the gin,and...

407
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,300
and I helped her walk
home,and she was so...

408
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:56,701
sad.

409
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,920
Said we didn't have any money
for presents,

410
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:04,621
but when we got home,
there was this bike on the steps.

411
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,810
It was a red Huffy with a banana seat.

412
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,070
I don't know.

413
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,170
Maybe she had some
kind of pull with Santa.

414
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,310
Why you looking at me like that ?

415
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,290
Ask Santa.
I'm sworn to secrecy.

416
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,430
I loved that bike.

417
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,500
I,uh,went ahead and ordered.

418
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,280
You need a menu or
you know what you want ?

419
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,350
Sesame noodles, Szechuan green
beans and hot and sour soup.

420
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,420
Something I said ?

421
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,030
Great minds think alike.

422
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,220
Sesame noodles.

423
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,550
Szechuan green beans.

424
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,470
Guess the soup's still on its way.

425
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,380
Eat before they get cold.

426
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,440
2221 Robman Street.

427
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,220
Pissed-off white guy from work

428
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:04,121
can't handle Julian's
taste in women,

429
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:06,421
follows him back to Regina's place.

430
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,000
White guy?

431
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,740
How do you think Regina's
black husband was gonna take it ?

432
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,330
His wife cheating on him with Julian.

433
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,340
You got a point.

434
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,910
Regina Reynolds ?

435
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,540
Yes ?

436
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,060
Few questions about Julian Bellowes.

437
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,000
- Remember him ?
- Remember him ?

438
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,310
Two of you were involved ?

439
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,220
Of course we were.

440
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,620
Julian was my brother.

441
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,170
Our mother was Creole.

442
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,560
Plenty of light-skinned folks
in our community,

443
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,961
but Julian was by far the lightest.

444
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:58,180
Kids gave him a hard time
for not being black enough.

445
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,560
Made him a man without a country.

446
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,010
How were things at home ?

447
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,760
Julian came back from
the service

448
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:05,761
living as a white man.

449
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,980
My father felt that he had lost
his only son,

450
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:12,281
but he never would have hurt him.

451
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,090
What was so urgent,had you
showing up at his office?

452
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,440
Our father was dying.

453
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,300
I wanted Julian to know.

454
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,550
Julian ever send you money ?

455
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:23,351
Every week without fail.

456
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,690
Think it eased his conscience.

457
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,350
Of course, we would have traded every
dime to have him around instead.

458
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,030
Anyone you know find out
what Julian was doing ?

459
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:39,070
Secret like that,
it's bound to catch up with you.

460
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,130
I see you got married.

461
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,500
Her name's Caroline.

462
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,560
She's a wonderful girl.

463
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,780
How much longer does he have ?

464
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,550
Doctor says we're at the end.

465
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,310
It's not too late, Julian.
It's Daddy.

466
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,480
He won't want to see me.

467
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,090
Caroline's expecting.

468
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,400
We're gonna have a baby.

469
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,290
A baby ? But what happens if...

470
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,640
I haven't been able to sleep in weeks.

471
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,720
Julian... you've got
to get ahead of this.

472
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,600
Lieutenant Bellowes.

473
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,200
George Watson from Fort Benning.

474
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,500
I think you're mistaken.

475
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,400
No mistake about it.

476
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,100
This is you, isn't it ?

477
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,530
Wife sure is pretty.

478
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,800
Sure have done well for yourself,
Lieutenant Bellowes.

479
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,210
Is there something
I can help you with ?

480
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:52,611
Come to think of it, there is.

481
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,160
Like to come to that office of yours
sometime,

482
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:58,161
catch up, talk business.

483
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,530
You have a card ?

484
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,200
Call first, all right ?

485
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,510
That was the last time I saw him.

486
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,480
He never got a chance to
say good-bye to my father.

487
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,550
George Watson. He the one with
the carpet company ?

488
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:24,851
Seen his ads.

489
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,670
That's him.He was just
getting started back then.

490
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,200
Why didn't you tell the cops
about this

491
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:30,901
when you found out Julian
was murdered?

492
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,260
I was a stranger at my
own brother's funeral,

493
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,700
wondering who all
those people were,

494
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:40,701
what they meant to him.

495
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,140
I realized that he belonged
to them now.

496
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:53,860
And if that's the way he wanted it,
I was going to honor his wishes.

497
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:05,650
When's the last time you saw
Julian Bellowes, George ?

498
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,860
In the service.
Fort Benning, Georgia.

499
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,450
Peacetime enlistment.

500
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:15,380
A witness saw Julian give you
his business card, Hot Skillet Diner,

501
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,790
South Philly, few weeks
before he was killed.

502
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:22,110
You're right. Sorry, Detective,
that was a long time ago.

503
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,350
Anything in particular you
wanted to discuss with Julian ?

504
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,770
Let me see.

505
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,500
I was interested in some work
he was doing up in Somerton.

506
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,260
You wanted to buy
a Libertyville property ?

507
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,720
No, not at all.

508
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,360
I was interested in laying
carpet in all those new builds.

509
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,800
We found your name

510
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:39,701
in Julian's office phone records.

511
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,980
You left more than ten messages for him.

512
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,230
Successful men don't
take no for an answer.

513
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,340
That's the way I built my company.

514
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,760
Any disciplinary issues when
you were in the Army, George ?

515
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,440
Dug up your service record.

516
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,600
Three non-judicial punishments
in your first tour,

517
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:58,201
all from Lieutenant Julian Bellowes.

518
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,190
Wait a second, now.
He treated me fair.

519
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,400
Same as the rest.

520
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,300
Must have made you angry,
seeing him in that diner,

521
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,360
realizing the guy who'd been
so tough on you

522
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:08,961
was only pretending.

523
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,690
I was angry because
he denied knowing me.

524
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,800
Truth is, I'd known for a long
time the secret he was hiding.

525
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,550
{\a6}<i>***</i>

526
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,550
Man, I don't know about that Army barber.

527
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,880
I mean, he gonna know what
to do with my kitchen ?

528
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,080
You seem to be in decent shape.
Tell him to use the clippers.

529
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,830
Private Bellowes.

530
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,200
Yes, sir ?

531
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,800
Soldier, how'd you get through school
with grades like this

532
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,201
and never learn how to check
a box ?

533
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,110
You marked "Negro"
instead of "white".

534
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,350
Excuse me ?

535
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,950
You could've ended up on KP
duty for the rest of your tour.

536
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,610
Unless you'd rather
peel potatoes

537
00:28:51,611 --> 00:28:53,511
than command a unit.

538
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,610
My mistake.

539
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,200
Now report to Company First Sergeant
in Processing

540
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:09,001
before they close.

541
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,730
Yes, sir.

542
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,340
Julian had a choice,
a way to be treated better.

543
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,530
Who was I to stand in his way ?

544
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,950
He ever give you that carpet
contract you were after ?

545
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,940
No.I guess he was afraid I
would tell someone his secret.

546
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,840
I thought successful men
didn't take no for an answer.

547
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,860
Look, I didn't begrudge the man.

548
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,060
If I'd had the same choice,
no idea what I would've done.

549
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,610
Thank you.

550
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,130
Ma'am ?

551
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:49,631
The family I always wanted
to meet.

552
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,500
He told me they had
nothing in common.

553
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,710
They'd had a falling out
over Julian's career plans.

554
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,860
Seems something much bigger than that.

555
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,040
Now that you know,
it shed any light ?

556
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,700
It explains what he
was trying to tell me.

557
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,910
Julian... are you all right ?

558
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,490
I'm fine.

559
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,630
You should go back to sleep.

560
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,790
Can't remember the last time
you weren't awake half the night.

561
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,420
Is it about the baby ?

562
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,400
Are you nervous about
becoming a father ?

563
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,860
Of course not.

564
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,490
Is it about Harry ?

565
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,750
What do you mean ?

566
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,240
He's got the silliest
thing stuck in his craw.

567
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,540
He had a conversation
with Gene Reilly.

568
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,200
Gene's a deacon over at All Souls.

569
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,720
It was so strange,

570
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:52,021
but Gene says he's never heard
of your family.

571
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,800
I told Harry he must be mistaken.

572
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,790
There's got to be more
than one All Souls.

573
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,070
I know you don't like me
to bring up your family,

574
00:31:00,071 --> 00:31:02,971
and I promised myself
I'd stop asking,

575
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:07,550
but... well, there's gonna be a baby.

576
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,100
Your parents are gonna be
grandparents.

577
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:16,170
And they made you.

578
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,420
Which makes me love them.

579
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:28,090
There's so much that you don't know
about me, Caroline.

580
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,200
You mean you don't
actually like to cha-cha ?

581
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,730
I'm serious.

582
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,710
There's nothing you could tell me
that would make me stop loving you.

583
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,380
Thank you.

584
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,520
I thought he was...

585
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:58,821
he was worried
about coming from modest means.

586
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,830
What a world we lived in

587
00:32:01,431 --> 00:32:04,731
that he felt he couldn't tell me
the truth.

588
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,160
You said Harry was
looking into Julian's past.

589
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,800
It possible he found out
about your husband's secret ?

590
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,990
My brother would have told me.

591
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,640
Wouldn't he ?

592
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,050
The hell you still doing here, Will ?

593
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,260
Could ask you the same thing.

594
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,280
Fair enough.

595
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,780
Lab results came back.

596
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,730
Blood on the broken glass
from the Legacy Room

597
00:32:34,731 --> 00:32:37,131
was Harry Kemp Junior's.

598
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,160
Night before he died, Julian was
fighting with his brother-in-law.

599
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,850
Caroline said he had been
looking into Julian's past.

600
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,670
Sounds like it finally
caught up with him.

601
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,691
Well, last time we spoke,
you stated you and Julian
were pretty tight.

602
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,540
Family, you said.

603
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,120
- Uh, that's right, yeah.
- You got a little detective in you, Harry ?

604
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,940
Looking into Julian's past.

605
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,530
Sniffing around the churche went to.

606
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,730
In 1958,where you went to church
was your family's social circle.

607
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,840
I mean, when he told me that
he went to All Souls, I...

608
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,590
You wanted to know where
this cowboy rode in from.

609
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:15,310
Looking for a crack in
that smooth veneer of his.

610
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,650
- Yeah, maybe I...
- You found out he didn't go there.

611
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,180
Never had.

612
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,170
Guy lied to your father, your sister.
Wonder why he'd lie like that, Harry ?

613
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,080
I don't know.

614
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,230
You know, uh, my mom always
warned me not to drink gin.

615
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,970
Said it messed with your head, could
make you do things you didn't mean to.

616
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,900
And you loved
your gin martini, Harry.

617
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,030
Tossing 'em back in the Legacy Room.
Then Julian comes back.

618
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,090
Told us it wasn't you fighting
with him that night.

619
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,800
You want to stick with that story ?

620
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,740
Julian's throat got sliced.
Could have been broken glass.

621
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,020
- So ?
- The blood on the pieces we found in the Legacy Room ?

622
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,010
Guess whose DNA.

623
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:56,500
You know, juries love
that DNA evidence, Harry.

624
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,720
I was you,
I'd start cooking up an alibi.

625
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,280
I didn't want to hurt him.

626
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,050
I just wanted the truth.

627
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,190
Harry.

628
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,430
Look, I know you've been talking
to Caroline about me.

629
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,370
You got a problem with that, Julian ?

630
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,400
She's my damn sister.

631
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,550
Come on. I'm... I'm here
to come clean.

632
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,550
You lied about where you grew up.

633
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,380
You lied about who you are.

634
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:40,650
Who are you, you damn fraud ?
Okay. We'll talk
when you're sober.

635
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,090
My father's betting everything
on a con man

636
00:34:43,191 --> 00:34:47,591
while I'm stuck in the stockroom
sharpening pencils !

637
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,160
I know you've gotten a raw deal
ever since I showed up.

638
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,610
Yes.

639
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,380
But everyone deserves a shot
to prove themselves,

640
00:34:56,381 --> 00:34:59,281
and I'm going to make sure
your father gives you yours.

641
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
Why the hell should I believe you ?

642
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,200
I lied about who I was
because I had to.

643
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,130
It was the only way for me
to be myself

644
00:35:07,431 --> 00:35:10,631
and not be trapped
by where I come from.

645
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,830
And where the hell is that ?

646
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,030
Abyssinian Baptist is a
couple of blocks north of here.

647
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,110
That's whe I was baptized.

648
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:26,510
That's where my whole
family was baptized.

649
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,670
Right there... is where I grew up.

650
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,440
My father is a carpenter.

651
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,040
His name is James Ridley Bellowes.

652
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,360
He's a Negro, Harry.

653
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,090
So am I.

654
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,100
You're related to them ?

655
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,980
I'm their son.

656
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,170
You remember the old saw
about judging a book ?

657
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,000
Does my sister know ?

658
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,900
I'm gonna tell her next.

659
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:13,380
Figured I'd start with
my toughest customer.

660
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,140
What's the party for ?

661
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,570
It's not a party.

662
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,790
They're saying good-bye
to him.

663
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,890
Who ?

664
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,700
My father.

665
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:33,501
He's dying.

666
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,730
Why aren't you in there
with them ?

667
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,560
There's something
I got to make right.

668
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,320
When I do, that's when
I can go home again.

669
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,160
I don't know. He dropped me off,
drove me home.

670
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,250
Never saw him again.

671
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,940
Anyone else find out ?
Your father maybe ?

672
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,470
Julian's death destroyed Dad.

673
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,060
I got the feeling he wished it
had been me instead of Julian.

674
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,670
So I told him the secret.

675
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:11,190
You never saw tears
dry up so fast.

676
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,330
Don't tell Caroline.
That's all he said.

677
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,420
Went in his office, shut the door,
started working the ones.

678
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,840
- Well, who was he calling ?
- Well, his high- placed friends.

679
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,600
Put a lid on the whole investigation.

680
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,370
Julian said there was something he needed
to make right before he could go home again ?

681
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,620
You know what that was ?

682
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,590
Yeah, he wanted to integrate Libertyville.
He'd already implemented the idea.

683
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,100
- Well, how so ?
- A few weeks before his death,

684
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,690
he preapproved a loan
for a mortgage.

685
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,000
The first black family.

686
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,140
You remember who they were ?

687
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,410
No, I never did know.

688
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:44,340
Took another 25 years for the first
black family to move into Libertyville.

689
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,520
Libertyville handled its own
mortgage applications.

690
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,880
You still got those records ?

691
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,710
There's a storage facility
and 50 years of paperwork.

692
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,850
You dig, Harry. I'll watch.

693
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,360
Give me a shot at this guy, John.

694
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,970
Doc said restricted duty.

695
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,840
The only thing that's gonna
cure me is doing my job.

696
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,920
Go on. Get in there.

697
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,770
Told us you had no interest
in a Libertyville home, George.

698
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,410
Look what we found.

699
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,540
A mortgage application for a model
called The Philadelphian.

700
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,860
That you, George ?

701
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,560
Well, that-that looks like
my signature.

702
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,910
This is where it says
you've been preapproved.

703
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,430
Whose name's that ?

704
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,180
It's Julian Bellowes.

705
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,840
What happened, George ?
Know you never lived there.

706
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,340
I don't remember. A long time ago.

707
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:55,650
Well, mortgage was being set up at
Emerson Mutual, Center City branch.

708
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,500
Everything was going through.

709
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,980
Until that morning,
November 7,1958.

710
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,290
When you went to the bank
to pick up your check,

711
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:06,291
they told you you couldn't have
that loan after all.

712
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,350
I ilt my company from scratch.

713
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:13,190
12 stores in the tri-state area.
Ads on televion.

714
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,730
Had your wife with you.

715
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:19,570
Must have been hard, having them tell you
they'd changed their mind right in front of her.

716
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,650
Put three kids through college
without help.

717
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,340
Did it all myself.

718
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,640
Look, reversing your application
like that.

719
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,550
I know what happened.

720
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,320
They saw the color of your skin.

721
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,660
Keep your grass mowed
and kids on point,

722
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:43,361
smile friendly and never complain.

723
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,590
Still... the neighbors are nervous.

724
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,160
I know.

725
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,760
I lived next door to 'em myself.

726
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,570
I know exactly what you would have done
if you had the choice Julian Bellowes had.

727
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,020
Hell, George, we both would
have done the same damn thing.

728
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,040
Taken it.

729
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,190
Yeah.

730
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:12,240
Black or not, Julian had no idea what
it was like for men like you and me.

731
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,910
He set me up for a fall.

732
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,660
Made you promises he couldn't keep.

733
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:21,040
Out front, a bright green yard
and an apple tree.

734
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,880
"A neighborhood of good
men and their families."

735
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,480
I just wanted what was fair.

736
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,100
What every other qualified vet
was getting when they called home.

737
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,830
A piece of the American dream.

738
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,870
All right, I know
it doesn't look like much,

739
00:40:35,871 --> 00:40:38,371
but Phase 5 is going to be
our best project yet.

740
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,960
I brought the sketches for you.

741
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,380
We're going to put a kidney-
shaped pool right...

742
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,870
What the hell's
the matter with you, huh ?

743
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,240
Your bank rejected me !

744
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,410
What do you mean ?I personally
approved your application.

745
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,420
My wife got herself a new dress.

746
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,030
Wanted to look her best.

747
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,450
Bank manager takes one look at us, then
starts talking about some clerical error !

748
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,700
Just calm down, George.

749
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,980
I will call him myself,
and I will straighten this out.

750
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,440
She cried all the way home.

751
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,930
Nothing I could say
made a bit of difference.

752
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,170
I let down my family
because of you !

753
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,650
The policies are wrong.

754
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,700
No matter how hard I work,

755
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,140
I can't make my life look like
it looks in one of your ads.

756
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,210
If I got to lend you
the money myself, I will.

757
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,540
You think I want your charity, huh ?

758
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:30,030
I got my own down payment
and the monthly.

759
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,790
I just can't get a break.

760
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,510
I understand.

761
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,790
You have no idea
what I'm talking about !

762
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,040
I caught more than my share of hell
for the color of my skin.

763
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,400
Most of it from my own people.

764
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,560
What, you blaming us now, huh ?

765
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,790
'Cause we can't snap our fingers,

766
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,391
skip to the head of the line
like you did ?

767
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,570
There's not a day that I have
not regretted that decision.

768
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,820
- This is my fight, too.
- How dare you ?! Huh ?

769
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:55,810
Running around, pretending to be a white
man, and now you want to be my brother ?

770
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,130
What you are is a disgrace.

771
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:12,570
<i>"This land is your land"
by The Brothers Four.</i>

772
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,540
* This land is your land *

773
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,810
*This land is your land *

774
00:42:22,611 --> 00:42:25,211
* From California Well, *

775
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:31,160
* to the New York Island *

776
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:36,110
* From the redwood forest *

777
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:40,430
* To the Gulf Stream waters *

778
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:49,550
* I tell you This land
was made for you and me *

779
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,460
* As I went walkin' *

780
00:42:56,561 --> 00:43:00,161
* Down that ribbon of a highway *

781
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,170
* I saw above me *

782
00:43:06,071 --> 00:43:09,971
* All that endless skyway *

783
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15,480
* Now I saw below me *

784
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:19,681
* That golden valley *

785
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:25,430
* And I said This land *

786
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:29,010
* Was made for you and me *
