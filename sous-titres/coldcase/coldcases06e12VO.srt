00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,990
You get done cleaning up
that mess,

5
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,391
go tackle the john.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,800
Stopped up again.

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,100
I look like a janitor,Tommy ?

8
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,960
Haven't taken my lunch yet.

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,260
You're spending too
much time on each job, Ed.

10
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,310
You gotta turn around six more cars
after you clean the can.

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,070
I'd eat first before I walked
in there, Ed.

12
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,771
Or call FEMA.

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,160
Hey, Channel 7,
what's she wearing ?

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,230
<i>Welcome to Pennsylvania Power...</i>

15
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:37,031
Wearing out
your bank account, buddy.

16
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,340
It's a sucker's dream.

17
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,390
Ed... can I talk to you ?

18
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,020
Yeah.

19
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,130
I just got the estimate
on my car.

20
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,040
I can't afford this.

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,560
Two grand,
ain't that beautiful.

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,730
Tommy ought to be ashamed
of himself.

23
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,010
Yeah, I just got my tuition bill,

24
00:00:58,011 --> 00:00:59,711
but I need my car to get
from work to school...

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,310
Relax. Relax.

26
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,240
Most of these repairs
you don't even need.

27
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,590
And I got a rebuilt
water pump in the back.

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,210
I just need it to run.

29
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,850
Uh... what can you afford ?

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,560
Um... maybe 400.

31
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,840
400 ? Okay.

32
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,080
I'll fix all the stuff you need to have
done and drop it off your place tomorrow.

33
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,360
- Don't sweat it, Shelly.
- Thanks, Ed.

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,650
You're the best.

35
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:24,920
<i>11...</i>

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,910
Keep cutting folks a break like that,
boss'll take it out of your hide, Ed.

37
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,670
Yeah,he can kiss it.

38
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,040
<i>20... 49...</i>

39
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,841
Hey, what's it up to ?

40
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,980
Jackpot. What's the latest ?

41
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,980
I don't know. 7,8 mil ?

42
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,120
<i>27...</i>

43
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:46,121
Break's over, George.

44
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,870
Ed, you just tell that
customer we padded her bill ?

45
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,430
<i>... and 55.</i>

00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,660
<i>Thanks for playing
Pennsylvania Power Lotto today.</i>

47
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,760
Talking to you, Ed.

48
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,840
You can stick it where the sun
don't shine,Tommy,

49
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:02,441
'cause I quit !

50
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,270
Look at this !

51
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,990
How long you playing
the lotto, Ed ?

52
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,500
Well, since my sister Pam was
old enough to buy me a ticket.

53
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,730
Hey, Ed! What are you planning
on doing with the 8 million ?

54
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,680
What do you think ?
I'm gonna spend it !

55
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,180
Well, Detective Strickland
just caught

56
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,981
that double over in Point Breeze.

57
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,920
I'll call you later.

58
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,700
Look like you could use
a few winks, Walt.

59
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,260
Too many open jobs, Lil.

60
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,160
Hoping you might be able
to take one off my plate.

61
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,270
Heard one might be thawing out ?

62
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,920
Auto mechanic named Ed Dubinski
got popped in Fishtown

63
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:18,621
on his way back
from the SwiftMart.

64
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,400
Way back to where ?

65
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,800
Working late in the garage.
Shooter took his wallet.

66
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,180
Robbery gone bad.

67
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,820
What we thought.

68
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,380
Thing is, Dubinski wasn't
just any grease monkey.

69
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,260
He won eight million in thelottery
six months before.

70
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,000
- Eight million ?
- Yeah.

71
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,160
I asked the bank to keep
Ed's account open

72
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:38,561
in case the doer tried to use
the stolen ATM card.

73
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,940
How much was in the account ?

74
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,900
Seven and change.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,660
Seven mil ?

76
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,220
Seven dollars and thirty-nine cents.

77
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,530
Dubinski went through it all.

78
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,400
Lost eight million dollars ?

79
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,390
Yeah. Turns out a lot of these lottery
winners get in over their heads.

80
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,530
One third of them go
bankrupt in five years.

81
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,790
Ed was no different.

82
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,430
Something kicked up on the case ?

83
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,870
Someone used Dubinski's card yesterday
at a sandwich shop in Center City.

84
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,380
ATM camera working ?

85
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,440
There wasn't one. Doer attempted a
withdrawal, checked his bank balance.

86
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,410
Means the killer knew
his PIN number.

87
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,300
Someone who knew him ?

88
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,120
Or the stickup guy made him
give it up.

89
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,110
But why wait two years
to hit that account ?

90
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,000
Unless they think the
jackpot's still out there.

91

Lotto Fever

94
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,590
Ed Dubinski, thirty-four.

95
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,790
Moved back to
his old Fishtown apartment

96
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,091
a few days before his murder.

97
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,160
Talk about bottoming out.The guy
burned through eight mil in six months.

98
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,660
Wait, how's that even possible ?
What was he,smoking it?

99
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,560
Jackpot's up to 18 mil this week.

100
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,820
More people in the pool,
more tickets we can buy.

101
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,550
I don't know.
Seems like a chump's game.

102
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,360
Well, this chump's gonna be rich
when the money train comes in.

103
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,070
You in the lotto pool, Will ?

104
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,460
Nope. It's pointless.

105
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,700
Wrong.

106
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,460
Point is, dreaming about the
things you'd do if you won.

107
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,690
Dubinski went for a pack of smokes
at the SwiftMart around midnight.

108
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,870
Shot in an empty lot on his way
back to the auto repair shop.

109
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,750
Slug from a nine
recovered from the body.

110
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,910
Cashier, Shelly Reid,
last to see talking to Rush.

111
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,710
Any surviving next of kin ?

112
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,960
Uh, older sister Pam,

113
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,461
owns a hardware store in East Falls
with her husband Marty.

114
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,600
Took custody of Ed at age 18.

115
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,080
What happened to the parents ?

116
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,210
Lost mom to a car accident,
dad to prison.

117
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,930
What else we got
on Ed's finances ?

118
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,850
Money manager listed here as
a Roger Weaver, on the way in.

119
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,940
PIN number was 747539.

120
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,540
Figure the killer had to
know Ed to get that number?

121
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,950
What are the odds of
guessing a six-digit PIN ?

122
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,450
I'll bet I could guess yours.

123
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,970
Shut up.

124
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,020
50 bucks. Give me your ATM card.

125
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,000
Tell you right now,it ain't
my birthday or my address.

126
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,310
Machine eats it,
you owe me double.

127
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,100
We'll see.

128
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,880
I work part-time at the Swiftee.

129
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,130
Going to night school
to become a veterinarian.

130
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,430
Tough, though, you know ?

131
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,980
You knew Ed
from the store, Shelly ?

132
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,180
He worked up the street, used to
come in for coffee and smokes.

133
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,460
Seemed like a nice guy.

134
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,200
You said that he fixed
your car ?

135
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,790
It was always breaking down.

136
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,170
He knew I was on a tight budget,

137
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:39,671
so he'd cut me a break and
then I'd give him free refills.

138
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,390
Ed come in to use
the ATM a lot ?

139
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,530
Sometimes. Just coffee that night, though.

140
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,220
He'd just moved back to Fishtown.

141
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,580
He seem okay to you
when he left the store ?

142
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,800
I think he was a little embarrassed
about losing all that money.

143
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,750
Can't believe somebody
would shoot him.

144
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,450
Sweet guy, you know ?

145
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,340
I can only offer
financial advice, Detective.

146
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,960
Most of my clients take it.

147
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,530
Mr.Dubinski was an exception.

148
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,590
An $8 million exception.

149
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,850
5.2 after taking the lump sum.

150
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,840
3 million after taxes.

151
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,030
Another million down on a
house with property tax due.

152
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,980
And the rest went to whomever
had their hand out first.

153
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,900
How'd you get hooked up
with Ed, Mr.Weaver ?

154
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,630
Well, I get most of my clients
through referral,

155
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:23,731
but Mr.Dubinski found me
in theYellow Pages.

156
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,120
You draw up a will for him ?

157
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,870
Well,I set him up with an attorney
to handle it,

158
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:29,871
but he was killed before
the scheduled appointment.

159
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,210
So any money would've gone to... ?

160
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,810
His sister, now stuck with probate.

161
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,540
But I'd be surprised if there's
enough to cover his funeral expenses.

162
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,710
We'll need to take a look at
all of his financial records.

163
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,760
Look,Detective,I regret I
couldn't help him more than I did.

164
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,830
But a fool and his money
are easily parted.

165
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,520
My little brother practically
grew up in this store.

166
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,350
Always tinkering with something.

167
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,060
Marty taught him how to fix things.

168
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,090
How he got so good with cars.

169
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,270
Anyone you know had a problem
with Ed ?

170
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,680
No. Everybody loved him ;
he was like a big kid.

171
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,030
If anything killed Ed,
it was that damn lottery.

172
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,480
The lottery killed Ed ?

173
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,570
We never had any money
when we were growing up.

174
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,960
It was all just too much.

175
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,860
His face gets on TV,
and all of a sudden

176
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:22,461
he's surrounded by a bunch of phonies
taking advantage of him.

177
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,630
Any in particular you remember ?

178
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,390
I didn't know any of them.
Too many freeloaders to count.

179
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,860
Well, hard to believe how fast
he burned through all that cash.

180
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,510
I tried to get him to do something
constructive with it,

181
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,211
but it was like, like the money
wasn't real to him.

182
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,680
Cleaned out his apartment,
there was nothing but bills left.

183
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,870
And this probate thing
is still a mess.

184
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,710
I'd like to get copies of Ed's
probate papers if that's okay.

185
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,740
However I can help.

186
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,110
Is Ed the kind of guy that'd give
out his ATM card or PIN number ?

187
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,040
Maybe. Ed trusted everybody...

188
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,641
generous to a fault.

189
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,170
Problem was,he just... couldn't say no.

190
00:08:57,071 --> 00:09:01,071

191
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,350
Hey,hey, you guys check
out the bathrooms ?

192
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,330
All-black porcelain and gold fixtures.

193
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,120
Plasma TVs in every one. Huh ?

194
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,200
Oh,it's,uh,it's really something,Ed.

195
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,120
Are those, uh, a pinball
machines over there ?

196
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,780
Yeah !

197
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,900
I used to get up everyday
to fix cars,

198
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:34,701
now I just play pinball all day.

199
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,850
Pammy, you remember when we were
kids when we went to Atlantic City ?

200
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,420
And then we just like
played all day.

201
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,000
Of course I remember,Ed.Yeah.

202
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,370
Do you know all these people ?

203
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,880
Sure,they're all my friends.

204
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,460
Just hope you're not spending
too much money.

205
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, hey, that reminds me.I got,I
got something special for you guys.

206
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,190
No, open it. Open it.

207
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,020
The Atlantic City boardwalk.

208
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,350
It's 50,000 !

209
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,450
I owe you,Pam.

210
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,860
Ed,you know you don't owe me a thing.

211
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,180
Thanks.

212
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,050
You're the best, bud. Thanks.

213
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,120
If you guys need anything else,
you just let me know,okay.

214
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,470
Smokey One-Niner,
this is Rubber Duck!

215
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,560
Your presence is requested
outside on the double.

216
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,150
Oh, dude. Sounds like
my ride just got here.

217
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,420
Hey, come on. Come on !

218
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,310
Yeah !

219
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,140
Oh, hello, pretty car.

220
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,070
This is awesome !

221
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,810
How much this car cost, Ed ?

222
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,280
Who cares ? Look at it !

223
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,740
Old Georgie wasn't laughing
too hard when his buzz wore off.

224
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,460
George Sweeney, from the garage ?

225
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,610
Yeah, the two of them were...
like kids in a candy store.

226
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,100
Used to be good friends.

227
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,490
Sounds like he handed
out a lot of checks.

228
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,620
We didn't need it,but
we put it to good use...

229
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,110
something I wish that
Ed would have done.

230
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,200
Now, George Sweeney filed a two
million-dollar lawsuit against Ed.

231
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,560
Hired that ambulance chaser
with those late-night TV ads.

232
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,920
The "King of Compensation."

233
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:27,721
Any record of a trial
or a settlement ?

234
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,390
Looks like it was dismissed.

235
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,270
George still works at
the auto shop in Fishtown.

236
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,430
Near where Ed was killed.

237
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,990
Yeah, maybe old George figured out
Ed's PIN number,

238
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:38,191
thought he was still due
a nice settlement.

239
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,210
What do you got ?

240
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,990
Figure out how the code's personal, we figure
out how the shooter could have known it.

241
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,060
Run Ed's personal info ?

242
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,660
Old phone numbers, addresses,

243
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:47,461
friends' birthdays, social numbers,
you name it.

244
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,100
- Nothing yet. / - We get any paperwork
from the money manager ?

245
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,990
Eight million dollars of it.

246
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,030
Saw the latest jackpot
just went up to $33 million.

247
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,350
Nick sucked you in on that pool ?

248
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,650
33 will pay for a lot
of old Blue Note vinyl.

249
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,790
How about you, boss ?

250
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,010
Got a better chance of
winning "American Idol".

251
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,810
First try, sucker.

252
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,880
Knew it had to be
either Flyers or boobies.

253
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,490
That's gonna leave a mark.

254
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,260
A little jumpy, George, or
you just naturally clumsy ?

255
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,200
What's this all about, guys ?

256
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,780
Ed Dubinski... you took a dive
on his property.

257
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,910
Ed was my friend.

258
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:27,711
Is that why you sued him ?

259
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,080
I had a lot of medical bills.

260
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,790
I just needed Ed's insurance
to pay up.

261
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,010
- It wasn't personal.
- Oh,sure it was.

262
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,970
You go back to rebuild
transmissions.

263
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,690
He goes off to spend his millions.

264
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,770
No, I was... I was happy for Ed.

265
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,740
Look, I... I was his friend
before he won that money,

266
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,780
and I was still his
friend after he lost it.

267
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
How did you know
he lost it all, George ?

268
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,510
Why else would you
move back to Fishtown ?

269
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,560
- You own a gun, George ?
- No, no, no.

270
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,510
I never asked Ed
for a thing, but,

271
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:54,311
I mean, you win a lotto
like that,

272
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,170
you never know who's gonna come
crawling out of the woodwork.

275

Listen, Ed...

276
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,510
I feel real bad about that
shark lawyer bugging you.

277
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,620
Yeah, I got to say I was kind of
surprised you didn't talk to me first.

278
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,060
- I mean, we go way back, right ?
- I know.

279
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,550
I had no idea that
he was gonna sue you.

280
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,060
Yeah.

281
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,920
I talked to my insurance people.

282
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,480
They said that ATV accidents
aren't covered under my policy, so...

283
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,900
here.

284
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,590
25 Grands ?

285
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,880
That's a lot of money, Ed.
I can't take this.

286
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,650
George, we're like family, man.

287
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,380
I don't want this to come
between us. Just... just take it.

288
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,040
Thanks. Thanks.

289
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,080
I best be going.

290
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,910
Some of us got to go back to work.

291
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,170
What, Tommy threatened
to fire you ?

292
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,090
Told me I got to do
three clutches tomorrow.

293

Hey, make sure you
resurface the flywheel.

Armchair mechanic.

295
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,190
What can I say ? I get bored.

296
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,930
All right.

297
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,700
First one with a head shot doesn't
have to make a run for beer.

I lose myself when the
real guns came out, you know,

299
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,640
I knew that it was time
to get back to reality.

300
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,010
The hell was this crazy old codger ?

301
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,360
- Ed said it was his father.
- His father ?

302
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,630
Thought he was long gone.

303
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,970
Yeah, he must have heard about
Ed hitting the big money.

304
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,730
Came to pick up a payday.

305
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,330
Didn't look like he came
back to have a catch.

306

Jack Dubinski, Philly PD.
Open up.

307
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,390
I'm entertaining a friend.
Do you mind ?

308
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,680
Not at all.

309
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,510
Open up, Jack.

310
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,680
Come back when you got
a warrant.

311
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,670
Gun !

312
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,840
What did you do that for ?

313
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,910
No, you don't.

314
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,110
Welcome back to Philly, Jack.

315
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,980
Watch the back...
not my back !

316
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,930
That gun's gonna land
you back in prison.

317
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,220
How long depends on what you tell us.

318
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,840
What did I do now ?

319
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,460
For starters, you're here...

320
00:15:24,461 --> 00:15:26,561
in the same town your son
got capped.

321
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,410
The world's a rough place.

322
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,780
I don't recall your daughter
telling us you were at his funeral.

323
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,680
I got no relationship
with my daughter.

324
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,240
No, you just came out of your
rat hole to shake Ed down.

325
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,770
A month later, your boy's dead.

326
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,860
Just 'cause I'm a crappy dad

327
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:39,261
don't mean I'd hurt my own blood.

328
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,660
Ed's old bank card got
used a couple days ago.

329
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,700
We turn this place upside down,
we gonna find it ?

330
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,110
Don't know what
you're talking about.

331
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,760
Why did you go see Ed, Jack ?

332
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,020
It wasn't a shakedown. I just...

333
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:51,321
need a little help,
get back on my feet.

00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,330
One thing I know about women

348
00:16:32,531 --> 00:16:35,931
who've got one hand on your wallet
and one foot out the door.

349
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,030
No risk, no reward, right ?

350
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,190
I must have got that from you.

351
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,420
Why I kept playing the
numbers all these years.

352
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,810
Blew through my share of cash, too.

353
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,910
Wished I'd put some aside,
looked out more for you.

354
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,620
Pam took care of me.
And Marty.

355
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,320
How is your sister ?

356
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,620
She'd be surprised to see you.

357
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,440
- Yeah.
- I know I was.

358
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,390
I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you, kid.

359
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,270
But we have plenty of time
to catch up now, don't we ?

360
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,060
Sure.Yeah, I'd like that.

361
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,910
All right.

362
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,090
Hey,I got something for you.

363
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,610
It's a... it's a French circus
Nikki's been wanting to see.

364
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,610
We're driving over
to Atlantic City tonight.

365
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,810
Hoping you could join us.

366
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,120
It sounds like fun.

367
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,400
Yeah,I thought, like, afterwards,
we go to the boardwalk,

368
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:26,901
like when Pam and me were kids.

369
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,570
And then we could go play pinball
and go over to that museum,

370
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,700
you know,the one with the...
with the mermaid in it.

371
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,210
Yeah,sure, Ed, listen...
uh, about that thing...

372
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,420
What, Dad ?

373
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,980
We talked about it before.

374
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,250
Thanks, son.

375
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,960
Don't worry,
I promise to pay you back.

376
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,000
Ed didn't like what I said
about his lady,

377
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:05,201
but he sort of knew
I was right.

378
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,770
So, where were you
the night Ed got shot ?

379
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,030
St.Joe's. The hospital,
getting prepped for surgery.

380
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,570
Surgery ?

381
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,350
Fused vertebrae so I can work again.

382
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,960
Ed's money saved my life.

383
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,500
Finally able to hold down a job.

384
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,320
Another Hallmark moment
in the Dubinski clan.

385
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,350
Yeah, we talked about...
keeping in touch,

386
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:25,251
but it just wasn't gonna happen.

387
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,640
Maybe you could call your daughter,
see if she'll bail you out.

388
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,510
Upsy daisy.

389
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,140
"Riskey," with an E.

390
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,430
Why ? Guy's a mechanic, not a
spelling bee champ. Put it in.

391
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,700
Satisfied ?

392
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,050
Not until I get everybody in the pool.

393
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,360
Know what the jackpot's worth ?

394
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,560
Enough to get me a down
payment on a Main Line mansion.

395
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,070
Walk-in closet...
full of high-heel shoes.

396
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,580
More tickets we get,
the better our chances.

397
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,230
Mama could use a new pair
of shoes.

398
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,780
Going through the
probate papers, found this :

399
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,050
a Nikki Dubinski opened
a credit card

400
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:20,151
using Ed's name and social.

401
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,720
Week before he died.

402
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,680
Ed's fiancee...
they ever married ?

403
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,640
Well, looks like she was enjoying
an extended stay at the Four Seasons

404
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:28,941
when he found out
about the card.

405
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,700
Froze the account, and she was
arrested for credit card fraud.

406
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:38,470
Nikki Dubinski, Nicole Atkins,
Nikki von Haven. Quite a sheet.

407
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,830
Fraud charges were dropped
after Ed's murder.

408
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,600
Lucky lady. Know where she is ?

409
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,700
Faxed her photo to a few
of the high-end hotels

410
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:47,301
and just got a call back
from the Hardtmore.

411
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,850
The concierge recognized her

412
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:52,651
as one of the ladies on
the four-star lounge bar circuit.

413
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,700
Oh... happy hunting for
her next millionaire.

414
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,190
Macallan 18, neat.

415
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,170
Old school Scotch man.
I like that.

416
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,330
Nicole Gillette.
Pleased to meet you.

417
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,270
John Stillman...
the pleasure is mine.

418
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,550
I'm thinking finance or
pharmaceuticals.

419
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:21,551
Close ?

420
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,510
Not quite.

421
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,890
Try not to make a scene, Nikki.

422
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,450
Hate to snatch you up out of here in
front of all these nice, rich people.

423
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,200
Oh,my.

424
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,990
I see three different names, Nikki.

425
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,620
What's the matter, fellas,

426
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:43,321
slow night in Killadelphia ?

427
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,470
Ed Dubinski. Your late fiance ?

428
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,550
I'm aware.

429
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,690
Someone used his ATM
card looking for money.

430
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,390
A little pillow talk,
figured you knew his PIN.

431
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,080
I don't know anything
about that or Ed's murder.

432
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,680
Do I look like a killer ?

433
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,040
Takes all kinds... even pretty ones.

434
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,260
Look, Ed knew the deal.

435
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,520
He enjoyed my company,

436
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:06,421
but we both knew
it wasn't built to last.

437
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,670
Two guys out front just repoed
your little race car, Ed.

438
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,220
Really ?

439
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,150
What, you don't care ? You got
checks bouncing all over town.

440
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,510
Hell, the pool boy even quit.

441
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,200
Is that before or after
you slept with him ?

442
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,920
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

443
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,330
I know how this works, Nikki.

444
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,470
It's been a good ride,
but it's time for me to get off.

445
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,460
No, it's time for you
to get off your duff, Ed.

446
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,720
Get it together and
figure out what you want.

447
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,560
You know what, you're right.

448
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,340
I want you to keep the ring.

449
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,170
So, that's it ?

450
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,980
It's time for me to
get my house in order.

451
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,350
Well, I'd start by paying
your property tax bill.

452
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,980
It's three months late.

453
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,250
I don't know which
was worse, Nikki...

454
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:49,251
winning the lotto or meeting you.

455
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,330
That was the beginning
of the end for Ed.

456
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,110
Went into a tailspin when he
couldn't buy his daddy's love.

457
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,940
Evidently yours, neither.

458
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,100
What happened to the rest
of Ed's money ?

459
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,740
He was all but broke by the time
he moved back to Fishtown

460
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:04,341
with his tail between his legs.

461
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,810
Where were you
the night Ed was shot ?

462
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,040
With a lawyer from Chestnut Hill.

463
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,250
I'd call him at work.

464
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,620
His wife's a real bitch
on wheels.

465
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,140
Found some big gaps
in Weaver's paperwork.

466
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,070
Yeah ? How so ?

467
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,320
For one thing, he charged
him 20% off the top.

468
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,200
20% ?! He should have just
hit the guy over the head.

469
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,580
And Weaver only put the minimum
down on all of Ed's hard assets.

470
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,930
His house, his car.

471
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,180
To put the cash into bonds ?

472
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,300
Or so he said,

473
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:33,701
but it looks like he was moving money
in and out of his accounts.

474
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,120
Using Ed's money as a float.

475
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,280
Maybe to shore up
other clients' accounts?

476
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,930
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.

477
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,930
I checked with the Board of Standards
for certified financial planners.

478
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,700
Ed filed a formal grievance against
Weaver just before his murder.

479
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,660
Could have taken away Weaver's license.

480
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,510
A/V unit found something else.

481
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,610
Check it out.

482
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,440
Also found him with three other
Powerball winners around the state.

483
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,380
Lottery millionaires were his racket.

484
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,790
Johnny on the spot.

485
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,020
Makes you wonder how
he keeps getting there first.

486
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,310
You know what I'd get ?

487
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,340
A new Bugatti.

488
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,880
It's mad torque, over 600 ponies.

489
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:10,581
Only built 300 of them.

490
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,040
Well, you ain't getting boo-gatti
'cause you didn't pony up for the pool.

491
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,770
What ? What ?
It's not too late, is it ?

492
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,490
Sorry, pal. Next time.

493
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hey, hey ,hey, here, come on.

494
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,280
Well...

495
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,270
Nice.

496
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,750
What the hell ?

497
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,440
Look at this.

498
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,590
Are you serious ?

499
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,560
Punkass bitch !

500
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,260
Punkass bitch ?

501
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,950
You do this to my car, pal ?

502
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,630
You the guy that been calling me ?

503
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,200
Oh, man, you guys are cops ?

504
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,220
Yeah, you got two seconds before you
catch the beating of your life, moron.

505
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,390
What is your problem, man ?

506
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,930
My problem ?
He slept with my wife.

507
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,530
- What ?
- Who's your wife ?

508
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,090
Frankie. She's my wife.

509
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,540
What a racket you get going, Roger.

510
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,010
We found the lottery official

511
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:12,111
who had been feeding you names
and addresses of the latest winners.

512
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,730
Gerald Malone.

513
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,000
Just lost his job.

514
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,440
But he is willing to testify that
you paid him for the referrals.

515
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,510
I don't believe this.

516
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,420
Working stiff like Ed never had a
chance with your paws on his money.

517
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:25,700
I have been a certified financial
planner for over 15 years.

518
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,710
Certified scam artist.

519
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,820
Securing bad loans,
making a mess of his money.

520
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,950
But no bailout for Ed.

521
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,670
He had to file a grievance
with the board.

522
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:35,071
You would have lost your license.

523
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,590
He was gonna have you prosecuted.

524
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,480
But a guy like you would
never let that happen.

525
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,330
What's, what's going on ?

526
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,940
You think that I had something
to do with Ed's murder ?

527
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,160
I'm sure the DA would find your attempt
to cover up fraud and larceny

528
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:47,861
pretty compelling motive, Roger.

529
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,030
This is ridiculous.I didn't kill Ed.

530
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,940
He almost killed me.

531
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,530
You got to take the long view, Ed.

532
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,050
Now, the market, it
took an unexpected turn.

533
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,160
Your investments are
down for the moment.

534
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,930
They're gonna rebound at some juncture.

535
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,160
- How long ?
- Hard to say.

536
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,510
Five, maybe ten years.

537
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,560
But...but I ... I still
got some money, right ?

538
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,910
Well, cash flow's a
little light right now.

539
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,850
No more toys for a while.

540
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,420
Uh, my house, my car...
is that some...

541
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,060
Well, the good news is that we can use
the equity left in your house

542
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:15,961
to pay off the rest of your debts.

543
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,380
And, uh, thanks to me, you
still have your old apartment.

544
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,730
- Thanks to you ?
- Yeah.

545
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,570
I held the lease termination,

546
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:24,571
just in case you needed
someplace to go back to.

547
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,010
Now, most people aren't as lucky.

548
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,270
Lucky ? You call this lucky ?

549
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,800
Back to square one is
what it's looking like.

550
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,040
Ah, come on, Ed. That's a
cynical way of looking at it...

551
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,460
Shut up !

552
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,230
I just,uh... I want to know... I

553
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,180
I want to know how much money I have
in the bank right now, this very second.

554
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,710
Around $100,000,

555
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:44,811
but I wouldn't recommend
touching that money right now, Ed.

556
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,620
I'm gonna fix this.
Come on, let's go. Now.

557
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,540
What ? Where ?

558
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,640
You're going downstairs with me
to the bank so I can get my money.

559
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,480
100 grand in cash ?

560
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,570
He put it in the briefcase.
Just walked right out of the bank.

561
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,130
Couple days later,
I heard he was shot.

562
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,830
Where were you that night ?

563
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,100
I had to meet a new client,
Suzanne McGee.

564
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,330
Lottery winner from Allentown.

565
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:14,050
Curious.You even feel anything
after hosing a guy like that ?

566
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,440
Let's be honest, Detective.

567
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,710
Wasn't like he earned it.

568
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,300
Called the IRS and the SEC.

569
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,180
They'd like to have
a little talk with you

570
00:26:27,181 --> 00:26:29,581
about all the money
you earned, Roger.

571
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,250
Met a guy last night,
says he knows you.

572
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:44,020
- Guy who knows me ?
- Yeah. Your husband, Billy.

573
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,580
You're kidding me.

574
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,950
Wish I was.

575
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,730
We're separated.
We have been for a while.

576
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,860
Does he know that ?

577
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,740
What happened ?

578
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,110
He jumped me outside
of Jones, Frankie.

579
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,190
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
But you're okay ?

580
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,290
Did you hurt him ?

581
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,720
When were you planning
on telling me about this ?

582
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,900
I mean, that's why you're
staying at the hotel, ain't it ?

583
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,760
Look, it's over.

584
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,220
We're just working some stuff out.

585
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,610
Oh, this isn't gonna be a problem,
is it ?

586
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,330
I'm thinking, yeah.

587
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,240
So... So, we're off for tonight ?

588
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,560
No, Detective Jeffries is not here.

589
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,120
What time's the kid
getting arraigned ?

590
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,490
Valentine ? Got it.

591
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,430
I'll make sure he gets it.

592
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,910
Money goes to the schools, right ?

593
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:42,211
Sure, boss.

594
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,630
Could also buy a hell of a boat.

595
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,470
Aloha.

596
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,650
Where are we
on Ed's missing cash ?

597
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,440
Well, checked all bank accounts,
safety deposit boxes.

598
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,730
Even Ed's old locker at the auto garage.

599
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,130
No briefcase, no money.

600
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,980
Just got off the phone
with his landlord.

601
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,290
Said a woman was rooting
around Ed's storage unit

602
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:03,091
in the parking garage
the day of the shooting.

603
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,470
Get a description ?

604
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,210
Medium height, brown hair,
mid-twenties.

605
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:08,511
Wearing a SwiftMart uniform.

606
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,060
Thought you just knew
Ed from the store, Shelly.

607
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,480
Uh,well,yeah.

608
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,240
I mean, he used to come
in there all the time.

609
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,900
So what were you doing at his place,
rummaging around his storage unit ?

610
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,580
What ? I wasn't rummaging.

611
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,220
What were you looking for ?

612
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,560
I was just... nothing.

613
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,470
I was returning his bike.
He let me borrow it.

614
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:28,171
His bike ?

615
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,740
Yeah.He lent it to me
'cause my car broke down.

616
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,610
He gave me the key
to his storage unit.

617
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,280
- When was this ?
- The day before.

618
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,360
I had no way to get to class
after work.

619
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,150
Really ?

620
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,750
He lend you his bank card, too ?

621
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,290
What ? No.

622
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,330
I dropped my car off
at the shop,

623
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:47,031
and George told me that Ed
had just moved back.

624
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,130
I heard what happened to him,

625
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:51,231
so I stopped by to cheer him up.

626
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:53,932
<i>"Two" by Ryan Adams.</i>

627
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,310
Shelly.

628
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,200
Can I come in ?

629
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,900
Oh, yeah. Uh, come on in. Sorry.

630
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,630
Heard you were back.

631
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,640
Just wanted to stop by and say hello.

632
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,770
Brought you some cupcakes.

633
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,860
Cupcakes.

634
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,180
Hey, um, do you want a beer ?

635
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,920
Sure.

636
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,070
Figured you could use
some cheering up.

637
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,220
First, thought maybe I'd bring you
a dog from the animal shelter.

638
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,620
Yeah. I'll stick with the cupcakes.

639
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,390
Oh, you don't like animals ?

640
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,130
No, I... I, uh... I do.

641
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,320
I had a dog when I was a kid.

642
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,440
Oh, yeah ? What kind ?

643
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,230
Just a mutt.

644
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,450
We named him after that weird museum
on the Boardwalk in Atlantic City.

645
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,520
- Ripley ?
- Yeah.

646
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,070
Yeah, he was always happy
to see you.

647
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,140
Oh, yeah, mutts are the best.

648
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,150
Never let you down,
less disease.

649
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,640
But when he did get sick,
you know, we just...

650
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,290
we just didn't have the
money to take him to a vet.

651
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,280
That's what you want
to do, right, be a vet ?

652
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:51,290
Trying. It's hard. You know, going
to school and holding down a job.

653
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,540
Yeah.

654
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,460
How's your... How's your car ?

655
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,440
Worse.

656
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,230
It's making this horrible noise.

657
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,610
Right when you turn it on ?

658
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,270
Yeah, it's like it's screaming
in pain.

659
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,340
Yeah. Probably just a belt.
Drop it off at the shop ?

660
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,470
Oh, I did, but they said they
didn't know what was wrong with it.

661
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,530
It's just dying, but I
can't afford a new one.

662
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,620
I can fix it.

663
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,150
Oh, I thought you were done
with that place.

664
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:17,251
I'll just call Tommy.

665
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,230
I mean, he's always looking
for a good mechanic.

666
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,220
Yeah, me, too.

667
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:27,310
I mean, um... if that's
what you want to do.

668
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,630
Yeah.

669
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,620
I sure is.

670
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,170
Thanks,Shelly.

671
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,360
Why are you thanking me ?

672
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,540
Ed left me a message to pick up my car.

673
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,630
The garage said I owed
them two grand for the work.

674
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,610
Told them, no thanks.
I'll take the bus.

675
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,610
Ed happen to mention if
he had any money left ?

676
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,420
No, and I didn't ask him.

677
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,310
Honestly... I think he
was glad to be rid of it.

678
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,110
You see what I see ?

679
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,760
Ripley.

680
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,730
Man's best friend.

681
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,200
Ed's childhood dog.

682
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,020
Dear old sis figured out
his PIN number ?

683
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,040
That, or she knew it all along.

684
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,140
We hope you could enlightened us

685
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:26,941
on how Ed's probate works, Pam.

686
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,990
Wish I could. It's been such
a headache.

687
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,730
Been almost two years since Ed died,
and it still isn't closed ?

688
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,950
It's so frustrating, but first,
they have to close out all his accounts.

689
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,800
So it's possible that

690
00:31:36,801 --> 00:31:39,301
there's an active account still out there
in Ed's name with money in it ?

691
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,290
I don't think so. I don't know.

692
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,920
You're not even curious ?

693
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,710
I mean,you've waited so long.

694
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,750
What are you talking about ?

695
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,400
You remember the name of the
dog you and Ed had as kids ?

696
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,950
Our dog ? You mean Ripley ?

697
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,560
Ripley. That's it.
Yeah. Great name.

698
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,820
Of course. I brought him home
for Ed after our dad took off.

699
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,250
Ed loved that dog.

700
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,680
Even used his name for a PIN number.

701
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,220
But you already knew that.

702
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,400
What ? Wait a minute.
I... I don't...

703
00:32:05,481 --> 00:32:07,281
Looked into your hardware store.

704
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,370
The bank's got a lien on it.

705
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,540
Marty and I have had
some debt issues.

706
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,320
Say, your real estate venture.

707
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,670
Loft conversions, wasn't it ?

708
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,450
Yeah, that market went
south after Ed died.

709
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,510
You slog through two long years

710
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:23,711
waiting for Ed's probate
to close.

711
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,580
His debts get paid off,
and you're still left with nothing.

712
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,670
How's that happen ?

713
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:29,971
Eight million to zero in six months.

714
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,130
What is this ?

715
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,970
I mean, I'd be dying to check

716
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:34,471
the balance of that last
outstanding account, too.

717
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:37,150
Especially if I had Ed's bank card.

718
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,130
No.

719
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,460
I loved my brother.

720
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,380
We... argued over money,
but we were still family.

721
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,340
We're converting each
floor into a loft space.

722
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,450
The kitchen will go here.

723
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,020
And the living room...

724
00:32:55,521 --> 00:32:56,621
will go here.

725
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,490
It looks really, really good, Pam.

726
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,800
Yeah.

727
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,700
Good luck.

728
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,460
Ran into a little bad luck, Ed.

729
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,840
That's why I asked you here.

730
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,400
Marty miscalculated a
couple things in the budget.

731
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,960
But with your help,we can still get
these lofts completed on schedule.

732
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,870
What happened to the check
I gave Marty three weeks ago ?

733
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,860
The other 50,000 ?

734
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,120
I didn't know about that.

735
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,490
I'm sorry, Pam. I just can't
invest any more money in this.

736
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,420
You spent $150,000 on a race car,

737
00:33:36,421 --> 00:33:38,921
and you won't help us out
with a real investment ?

738
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,480
The car was stupid.
Blowing all that cash,

739
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,970
but so is trying to solve
erybody else's problems.

740
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,140
Everyone else ?

741
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,510
It just complicates things, Pam.

742
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,230
In a bad way.

743
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,900
You're right. I'm sorry.

744
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,960
- Don't worry about us.
- Yeah ?

745
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,030
You guys are going to be all right ?

746
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,550
Yeah. Of course.

747
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,440
- Okay.
- We have other options.

748
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,700
Business line of credit,
home equity line, yeah.

749
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,980
We'll be fine.

750
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,840
Question is,
are you going to be okay ?

751
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,541
Yeah.

752
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,380
I'm just trying to get
back to where I started.

753
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,440
Are you completely broke, Ed ?

754
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,530
Hey, I got my old job back.

755
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,860
I think everything's going
to work out all right.

756
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,590
I was so embarrassed.

757
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,150
It's hard enough to
ask someone for money.

758
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,030
It must've been even harder
for Ed to turn us down.

759
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,500
So your husband never told you

760
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:39,201
he had already hit Ed up
for $50,000 ?

761
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,620
Marty got in over his head.

762
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,721
He'd shut down whenever
I brought up money.

763
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,160
This is a consent form.

764
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,680
It allows us to search your store.

765
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,100
The store ? I don't understand.

766
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:53,300
Well,it would just help us to
clear both you and your husband.

767
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,890
Marty ?

768
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,870
But that's ridiculous.

769
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,320
You don't think for a minute
that Marty...

770
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:00,721
Do I need a lawyer ?

771
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,710
Only if you have something to hide.

772
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,580
That's a filthy habit, Marty.

773
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,950
I had a girlfriend,
chewed her nails.

774
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,580
It drove me crazy.

775
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,040
Yeah, I guess,you take
it all on yourself, huh ?

776
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,550
Running a business,
paying the bills...

777
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:33,751
Why am I here, Detective ?

778
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,010
I'm just saying, if I got
myself into money trouble,

779
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,160
I'd have a chat with the little lady.

780
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,790
You know, not be a coward
about it, that's all.

781
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,910
I know how to handle my
own business, thank you.

782
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,740
Is that why your wife had to go
beg her brother for more money ?

783
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,470
- After you ?
- Pam told you that ?

784
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,690
Also said you screwed up big
time on that loft project.

785
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,540
No, we just need enough to get started
with the construction, that's it.

786
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,620
He already gave you a hundred-K.

787
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,650
Hell, I'd have turned you down, too.

788
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,370
A hundred thousand was nothing !

789
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,990
He had eight million.

790
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,660
Did you even like your
brother-in-law, Marty ?

791
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,080
Yeah, I did.

792
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,310
I loved Ed.

793
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,220
I treated him like he was my own.

794
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,240
And he repaid you by saying
"no" when you needed him most.

795
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,850
- Are we finished here ?
- Sit down !

796
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,130
Where were you night
Ed got shot ?

797
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,150
Where I am every night.
Home with Pam.

798
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,570
Ask her.

799
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:30,580
He was with me, watching TV.

800
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,290
- Thank you.
- Watching what ?

801
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,260
I don't know, um...

802
00:36:39,604 --> 00:36:40,886
Wheel of Fortune.

803
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,050
The rest of the night ?

804
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,710
And Marty never went out ?

805
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,330
I mean, um...

806
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:52,731
Sometimes he went back
to the store to close... to clean up;

807
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,870
you know, to make sure
it was locked up.

808
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,450
Oh, so he left to go back
to the store that night ?

809
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,170
I don't know. I don't know.
I can't remember.

810
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,460
You remember
what you were watching,

811
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:04,561
but you don't remember
if he went out ?

812
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,000
Where's, where is Marty ?
I need to talk to him.

813
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,850
How did he react when you told him that
Ed wasn't going to give you the money ?

814
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,890
He must've been angry,
wasn't he ?

815
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,450
What ? No. No, it wasn't like that.

816
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,050
Oh, everything you did for him,

817
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:23,151
raised him when your father
couldn't be bothered.

818
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,200
We did what was right.

819
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,260
What we had to do.

820
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,230
But Ed didn't. Did he ?

821
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,610
The fact that you had to,
you know, even ask for money ?

822
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,560
Marty had a right to be upset.

823
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,350
No. No, Marty loved Ed.

824
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,560
He was my brother.

825
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,070
Got it.

826
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,750
$8 million.

827
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,900
Oh, jeez. Marty, you scared me.

828
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,760
Wait, wait...
what are you doing here ?

829
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,190
Did you really tell Pam
you won't help us out, Ed ?

830
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,960
Come on, Marty, I'm done
talking about money.

831
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,030
Do you know how hard it
was to ask you for that ?

832
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,280
Marty, I'm sorry. I can't pay
for your business mistakes.

833
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,990
My mistakes ?

834
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,580
We had to delay construction, because
your sister didn't get the permits.

835
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,250
I don't know what to tell you.
We might lose the store.

836
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,730
- What ?
- The store, Ed !

837
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,300
Where you grew up !

838
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,950
Does that mean anything to you ?

839
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,140
Pam didn't say anything about that.

840
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,800
I just... I don't get it,man.

841
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,640
I mean, after all we did for you.

842
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:08,370
All the sacrifices we made for you.

843
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,790
Look, I'm sorry, Marty.
I can't give you the money.

844
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,210
I don't have it.

845
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,090
I don't believe you.

846
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,450
What are you doing ?

847
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,540
I'm sorry, Eddie. The money's coming
to us whether you're dead or alive.

848
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,780
No, it's not, 'cause it's all gone.

849
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,960
That's not true !

850
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,060
I gave to someone
who deserved it.

851
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,420
The only person who
didn't ask me for it...

852
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,280
Well, it turns out, there was
more money out there, Pam.

853
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,140
Shame you'll never see it.

854
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,130
Where did you get this ?

855
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,830
Your dresser drawer.

856
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,860
The search consent you
signed was also for your home.

857
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,650
- Marty...
- No.

858
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,120
Not Marty.

859
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,590
You.

860
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,620
You knew the PIN number.

861
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,440
The card's going to have
your prints all over it.

862
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,500
You waited so long,

863
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:13,401
you finally just had to check
that account, didn't you ?

864
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,430
I didn't shoot my brother.

865
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,550
No, you sent your husband
to do the dirty work,

866
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:18,551
then you tried to throw him
under the bus.

867
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,820
How dare you...

868
00:40:19,821 --> 00:40:22,521
All you did for Ed,
all those years.

869
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,580
How could he just blow it all ?

870
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,790
Even gave some to your father.

871
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,630
- No, he didn't.
- Oh, yes he did, Pam.

872
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,730
Somehow he cared more
about Jack than you.

873
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,820
My father was a bum.

874
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,550
Without me, they would've
put Ed into the system.

875
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:38,530
He was eight years old.

876
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,280
And the one time you came to him,
he turned you down.

877
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,050
I was his sister.

878
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,170
And he owed me !

879
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:49,900
<i>...to someone who deserved it.</i>

880
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,100
<i>The only person who
didn't ask me for it...</i>

881
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,910
It's over.

882
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,490
I'm sorry

883
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:37,671
<i>"On the way back home"
by Lucero</i>

884
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:43,090
* So young and so hungry,
so unqualified *

885
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:47,890
* Don't want the jobs anyways
,no settled life *

886
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,320
* To get out of here,
two options, one chance *

887
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:57,310
* You joined the army
and I started a band *

888
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,630
* We'll meet at the bar,
we'll buy us a round *

889
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,090
* We'll toast that we're back home *

890
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,620
* We'll toast this damn town *

891
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:11,010
* Annie's still working behind the bar *

892
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:15,650
* You can buy her a drink,
I'll sleep in the car *

893
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,260
* Well, let's go *

894
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,750
* It's on the way back home *

895
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,210
* It's on the way back home *

896
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:30,730
* It's on the way back home *

897
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,960
* We'll be there soon

898
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,520
* We'll be there soon *

899
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,200
* One of two choices *

900
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:52,460
* I guess I've made mine *

901
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,350
* I drink in a different
town nearly every night *

902
00:42:57,422 --> 00:42:59,534
* And now you don't drink
for months at a time *

903
00:42:59,634 --> 00:43:01,801
....................

904
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,720
* I owe you a couple rounds,
we're back home tonight *

905
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:11,250
* We'll meet at the bar,
we'll drink to old times *

906
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:15,900
* We'll toast that we're back
home and those left behind *

907
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,930
* Annie's still working behind the bar *

908
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:25,280
* You can buy her a drink
and I'll sleep in the car *

909
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,930
* Let's go *

910
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,160
* It's on the way back home *

911
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:37,060
* It's on the way back home tonight *

912
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,600
* It's on the way back home *

913
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,210
* We'll be there soon *

914
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,890
* We'll be there soon *
