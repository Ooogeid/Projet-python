1
00:00:08,837 --> 00:00:10,572
Hey, we're running out of sun.

2
00:00:10,903 --> 00:00:12,830
- Come on, let's play.
- Let me finish.

3
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:13,876
Oh, hi Skip.

4
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:15,555
Oh, that's a good one, son.

5
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:17,868
- You even got the robin's nest.
- Thanks, ma.

6
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,704
- Where is dad?
- Uhm, working late I suppose.

7
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:22,803
<i>And now a news update.</i>

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,382
<i>Yesterday Japan continued
its attack along Mount Samat.</i>

9
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:29,079
<i>The US Philippine divisions suffered heavy losses.</i>

10
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:36,953
- Oh my God.
- God.

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,519
Sorry I'm late sweetheart.

12
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,245
How can we afford a new car?

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,640
The bank's just credited us
a loan for two new stores.

14
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:57,805
- It's called franchising.
- I thought they said no.

15
00:00:58,163 --> 00:00:59,843
I went to the old backup plan.

16
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:02,265
The backup plan being "don't give up"?

17
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:04,742
- Never fails.
- This is a Packard!

18
00:01:05,127 --> 00:01:06,861
Yup, gonna drive you to art classes in style.

19
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:09,573
Hey,

20
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:11,789
what do we have here?

21
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:13,881
Some fat heads at school.

22
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,588
Blamed me for Pearl Harbor.

23
00:01:15,835 --> 00:01:18,148
We're as American as those boys.

24
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:19,580
Did you sack 'em back?

25
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,360
- I thought fighting was bad.
- It is.

26
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:25,553
But standing up for yourself is another thing, son.

27
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:27,040
Don't forget that.

28
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:29,965
Give it a touch Mr. T?

29
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,704
Absolutely Skip.

30
00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:35,182
Come on, huddle up, Billy.
You too honey. Let's go.

31
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:37,191
Skip, you're going down.

32
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:40,467
Come on. You stay away there, Skip.

33
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,036
Alright, let's do this. Ready?

34
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:44,128
Team!

35
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:48,078
3-42. 3-42.

36
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:50,474
Never seen such a swollen-looking center.

37
00:01:50,748 --> 00:01:52,180
What are you doing after the game, hot-kicks?

38
00:01:52,372 --> 00:01:54,520
- Wouldn't you like to know!
- Dad, come on!

39
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:55,759
Al right. Hike!

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,925
Dad?

41
00:02:16,382 --> 00:02:19,328
All Japanese persons,
both alien and non-alien will be...

42
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:23,568
evacuated by noon on April 7th 1942.

43
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,747
What do they mean, alien and non-alien?

44
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:30,670
They mean us.

45
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:08,767
Court that bad?

46
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:12,896
Coffee there makes this stuff gourmet.

47
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:19,406
Last day of boss's suspension.

48
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:22,931
Jeffrey said he's putting
in his retirement papers.

49
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:28,064
- Any word on who would be coming in?
- Not Jeffries.

50
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:31,753
Some clown from West.
Been reassigned six times.

51
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:35,139
I didn't know what I'd do
if I didn't come here every day.

52
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:37,685
Some things I'd miss,
some things I wouldn't.

53
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,392
Like... court.

54
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,434
All pains in the ass those A.D.A's.

55
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,663
Yeah, real pains.

56
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:47,361
Oil and water.
Cops and Lawyers.

57
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:49,343
Usually, that is.

58
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:51,297
More like 24/7.

59
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,477
Excuse me, are you detectives?

60
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:55,496
Yeah.

61
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:00,588
My father, Raymond Takahashi,

62
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:02,832
was killed in 1945.

63
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,818
- They never caught who did it.
- It's sixty-plus years ago.

64
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:07,111
A long time.

65
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:10,581
I just found a 20,000-dollar check from the government...

66
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:13,527
- issued to my mother in the 1990.
- Tax refund?

67
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:16,898
Restitution.

68
00:04:17,503 --> 00:04:18,714
My family was...

69
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,220
at the Manzanar relocation center.

70
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:23,064
Manzanar? What's that?

71
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:28,377
A camp in California where they held
Japanese-Americans during World War II.

72
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,668
- An internment camp.
- I was born there.

73
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:35,686
Never knew it, my mother
was too ashamed to tell me.

74
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,645
So, what's that gotta do
with your father's murder?

75
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,582
My father was killed a few months after
we got out and moved to Philly.

76
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:46,931
Maybe the police were looking
in the wrong place for his murder.

77
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,919
Maybe, eh?

78
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:51,128
I found this old picture,

79
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:55,891
of my parents and
my big brother Billy.

80
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:58,589
He died in the war.

81
00:05:00,915 --> 00:05:02,374
The way she smiled at them...

82
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,852
She never looks at me like that.

83
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:11,197
I'd love one chance to meet
the woman in that picture.

84
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:17,776
- We'll take a look. Can't promise
we'll find anything - I understand.

85
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:20,258
Thank you.

86
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,419
So... the guy survived being locked
up in an internment camp.

87
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,630
Only to be killed in the City
of Brotherly Love.

88
00:05:31,783 --> 00:05:36,479

89
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:44,678

93
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,591
Ray Takahashi.

94
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,420
Body found a few blocks from
the old municipal stadium.

95
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,274
Night of the Army-Navy football game.

96
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:14,621
He was beaten, pushed down a
flight of stairs, broke his neck.

97
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:16,912
The theory was some drunk
bigget roughed him up.

98
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:18,239
Took things to far.

99
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:21,238
All of two interviews
were grow hard on this one.

100
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:23,078
Cause a Jap's a Jap, right?

101
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:25,744
Ray's family lived in California until

102
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:30,043
FTR banned all Japanese-Americans
from the West Coast in 1942.

103
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:34,036
One hundred thousand were forced
in the camps without do process.

104
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:35,619
Most were born and raised there.

105
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,789
And none were ever
arrested for espionage.

106
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,181
Ray's son, Billy, gave up his
life for the american dream.

107
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,488
Died overseas on 1944.

108
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,850
Were founds an empty
envelope on Ray's body.

109
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:48,372
Addressed to him in Manzanar.

110
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:51,478
Return address just says APO 513.

111
00:06:51,553 --> 00:06:54,237
Army post office. How we
used to get our mail home.

112
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:55,895
The letter could be from his kid Billy.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,754
Not likely. It was mailed
November 27th, 1944.

114
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:01,473
Billy died October 13th.

115
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:03,493
An envelope, no letter.

116
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:05,343
Contents could be a motive.

117
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:09,176
So, what's the letter writer hiding?
Something that happened in Manzanar?

118
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,462
Let's strike down all the records
we can get from there and...

119
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:14,090
have Laitens take a look.

120
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:16,865
Good luck in the print off
for sixty-year old envelope.

121
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:21,297
Boss was military too.
Might have some input.

122
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:24,372
You'll have better luck with the print.

123
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:30,719
Thanks.

124
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:37,277
Quiet gettin' to you?

125
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,392
- I am not much of a cook, frankly.
- Right.

126
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:43,202
You're here for the chili?

127
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:45,945
No... for a job.

128
00:07:46,277 --> 00:07:49,714
A Japanese-American camp
internee killed in '45.

129
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:52,533
The night of the Army-Navy game.

130
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:54,704
My father was at that game.

131
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:58,021
- Proud Army Man.
- It must have broke his hearth.

132
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:00,704
- You're going Navy.
- Ah! You got over it.

133
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:03,116
Eventually.

134
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,548
Found this on our victim's body,

135
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,719
APO is the only clue to who sent it.

136
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:11,558
Oh, have Laitens take a look.

137
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:14,950
I'm sure Jeffries already told you that.

138
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:20,966
Our victim's son, Billy, died
in the war, he was an army guy.

139
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,639
442nd?

140
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:26,377
All Japanese-American unit.

141
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,789
Most decorated of the
time, for its size.

142
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:30,840
Could use your eyes on this one, boss.

143
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:35,317
?????I put my papers in the
ready though. You know that.

144
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,734
So, what are we supposed to do
without you kickin' our asses?

145
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:46,865
You'll survive.

146
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:51,614
Enjoy your chili.

147
00:09:09,351 --> 00:09:11,781
Why did you bring this
stranger, here, Barbara?

148
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:15,378
- You know I don't wanna talk about it.
- It's been 62 years, mom.

149
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:20,115
- Isn't it time you did?
- You recognize this... Mrs Takahashi?

150
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,413
- No.
- Your husband had it when he was killed.

151
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:26,224
- Do you know anyone in the Army who might have sent it?
- No.

152
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:35,469
Quite a picture. You draw that?

153
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,895
My son did. Billy.

154
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:42,064
That's him with his best
friend Skip, from home.

155
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:44,990
I heard about your
son's unit, the 442nd.

156
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:49,002
- Not many have.
- Real heroic guys.

157
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:54,038
The war was supposed to make us equal.

158
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:58,175
- It didn't.
- Because... you were in the camps.

159
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,926
- It's okay to talk about it, mom.
- What difference does it make.

160
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,923
Solving your husband's murder?

161
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:07,924
- Maybe Manzanar have something to do with it.
- Why?

162
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:13,676
We were just a number, no
names. 8108, like criminals.

163
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,622
Did you make any enemies here?

164
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:20,405
From the moment we arrived.

165
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:24,046
Let's go, get out, let's go, right now.

166
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:27,114
- Okay, sir.
- Come on, quickly, quickly, ome on, right here.

167
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:30,402
Right here, in the line, right
here, let's go, get your things.

168
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:33,338
Come on, right here,
let's go, come on, move it.

169
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:52,203
- How long are we going to be here for?
- Not too long.

170
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,971
It's for our own protection.

171
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,069
Then why are the guns pointed at us?

172
00:10:57,536 --> 00:11:01,324
Billy, we'll just sit tight, be good citizens
and won't be out of here **, understand?

173
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:05,477
- Name, Sir?
- Takahashi.

174
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:10,861
You will be in block 18 room
7, with the Watsanabi family.

175
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,144
- We have to share?
- At least we'll be together.

176
00:11:15,018 --> 00:11:19,117
Mattresses. Down the way
you can fill them with straw.

177
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,989
How's the school here? I bet you folks didn't
know you got a young Rembrandt visiting.

178
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:29,208
- Are you an artist?
- I guess.

179
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:33,053
Me too. I teach a painting
class. It's gonna be fun.

180
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,719
I made this. So that you
don't forget you're Americans.

181
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:45,162
- Just wanted to give you some sort of welcome.
- Your smile is welcome enough.

182
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:48,584
I have seen nothing but frowns all day.
The sun's still shining.

183
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:52,002
- Don't understand?
- They're messing with you, Mary Anne?

184
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:55,284
No, Larry, it's okay.

185
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:58,347
I don't know why they let you people in this country.

186
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:00,893
I was born here.

187
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,494
And you got cousins in the old country,
fighting for the Emperor?

188
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:06,869
Scholz. That german?

189
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:10,260
- Your cousins fighting for Hitler?
- You watch it, Mister.

190
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:14,230
Pick it up.
I said pick it up, Jap.

191
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:37,016
You know the funny thing about wars, kid?

192
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,594
They always find a way to end.

193
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,500
- We will meet outside this fence, one day.
- Count on that.

194
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:43,801
Yeah.

195
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:51,719
But this guard, he
headed out for your husband.

196
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:55,720
Patroled the camp, gun at a ready, looking for trouble.

197
00:12:55,963 --> 00:12:59,686
- He and Ray ever had another running?
- Not that I know of.

198
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:04,998
I found our guard, Larry Scholz.

199
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:09,125
Shipped out in Manzanar on '43.
Stationed in Italy, till the end of the war.

200
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:11,921
- A rock-solid alibi if I ever heard of one.
- Not quite.

201
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:15,594
He got a medal on the 1945 Army-Navy game,
here in Philly.

202
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:18,625
- The same night Ray was killed.
- Maybe they met up again.

203
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:20,937
Larry's side of the world
needed one less jap.

204
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:23,471
'cause keeping them in prison wasn't enough.

205
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:28,157
We were at war. They'd have done
the same to us, if you were in Japan.

206
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:30,469
Would you feel the same if it was your family?

207
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:36,703
So where is Larry Scholz's current place of residence?

208
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,032
Veterans Army Hospital at Virginia.

209
00:13:40,783 --> 00:13:42,347
There's a five hour drive.

210
00:13:44,714 --> 00:13:48,563
- Shame I got all this paperwork.
- Shame I'm still on hold.

211
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:52,032
Have fun, sweet talking.
Tollbooth Tennence.

212
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:54,688
Yeah.

213
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,889
Larry Scholz?

214
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:05,170
Philly P.D.
We're here about Ray Takahashi.

215
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,763
- Taka what?
- Hashi.

216
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:11,812
Takahashi. He was at Mazanar
internment camp in 1942.

217
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:14,295
- Under you watch.
- Murdered in '45.

218
00:14:14,463 --> 00:14:16,419
- Witness think you had a beef with him.
- Beef?

219
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:19,341
You kidding me?
I was just doing my job.

220
00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:22,920
- We were at war.
- Imprisoning our own citizens, yeah.

221
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,280
- That make sense.
- Saying you wouldn't think twice about sitting

222
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,456
on a plane next to an arab
after 9/11?

223
00:14:31,623 --> 00:14:32,639
Come on.

224
00:14:34,728 --> 00:14:37,623
You sent this to Ray, all overseas?

225
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:40,231
Never seen that before in my life.

226
00:14:40,404 --> 00:14:42,766
- Look close.
- I'll look all you want.

227
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:47,593
- I didn't send that letter to some enemy out of state.
- Hated the guy, didn't you?

228
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:50,092
Kept tabs on him at camp, sure.

229
00:14:51,152 --> 00:14:53,687
- Part of my duties.
- How long did you watch ray for.

230
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:58,768
Until I realizes his old ball and chain
was keeping him too busy to make any trouble.

231
00:15:10,603 --> 00:15:12,653
You're drawing me another pretty Blue Jay?

232
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:14,260
Sure, ma.

233
00:15:16,994 --> 00:15:19,560
I was about to look at the bulletin of
japanese-american enlistment.

234
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,294
- Does it mean we can leave?
- Oh, no.

235
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:25,032
- It means you can enlist, son?
- Enlist?

236
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:26,988
Prove as american as the rest.

237
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,219
You're gonna make a great soldier.
I know you got it in you.

238
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:34,435
This why I'd be fighting for?

239
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:38,077
- Billy.
- What did I say on the first day, dad?

240
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,577
- Private 8108, part of the duty.
- This is just temporary.

241
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,670
We have to act right to prove ourselves?

242
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,157
- Don't say we don't belong here.
- I'm not going.

243
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,868
What the hell is the matter with him?

244
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:58,873
We've been acting right for a year
already in this place.

245
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:01,893
The whole contry is making sacrifices,
we have to play our part.

246
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:03,731
We're living in a shack.

247
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:08,249
Standing in lines for food like baggers
we have lost everything we worked for.

248
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:11,030
Open your eyes, Ray, for once.

249
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:15,813
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, come on.

250
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,532
Calm down, Evelyn!
You love those plates.

251
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:23,372
I'm pregnant.

252
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:27,795
What?

253
00:16:28,827 --> 00:16:29,938
You are?

254
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:32,748
That's fantastic.

255
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:39,315
I can't... raise a baby in a place like this.

256
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:42,812
Not as a prisoner.

257
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:51,612
Didn't have hit him or harass him after that.

258
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:53,611
Real sweet of you, Larry.

259
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,643
- Where were you the night of the army navy game?
- Getting my medal.

260
00:16:57,906 --> 00:17:00,096
- Ask Truman.
- Ceremony didn't last all night.

261
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:02,783
Talk to my commanding officer,
he's right down the hall.

262
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:05,157
In the president suite.

263
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:10,128
- Larry Scholz's lieutenet confirmed his alibi.
- A real gold prize, that guy.

264
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,518
Forgot your file, Lil.

265
00:17:13,297 --> 00:17:14,314
John.

266
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:17,435
Good to see you.

267
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:22,128
- Just droppin' and off.
- Any thoughts on who sent the envelope?

268
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,329
I talked to my military contacts about it.

269
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:28,989
The army post office number
came from a french hospital.

270
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,488
- No army examiner stamp.
- Meaning...

271
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:34,348
Meaning it didn't go through inspection.
It came from an officer.

272
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:36,722
Thanks.

273
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:39,331
Gotta go.
Good luck.

274
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,129
- Just droppin' something off...
- Right.

275
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:51,522
Mazanar logs.
One visitor in the three years Ray was there.

276
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:53,583
Skip Robertson, Billy's friend.

277
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:58,163
- Makes sense he would visit.
- Turns out Skip was also Billy's lieutenent.

278
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,601
Injured in the same battle
that killed Billy and friends.

279
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:06,759
- Could be our letter writer.
- So what's he hiding?

280
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,382
Appreciate you driving
out from Jersey, Skip.

281
00:18:19,383 --> 00:18:20,994
Oh, please, call me Eugene.

282
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:27,836
- Recognize this hand writing?
- Yeah, it's mine. Where did you get it?

283
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:29,513
Ray Takahashi had it....

284
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:31,030
when someone pushed him
down a flight of stairs...

285
00:18:31,031 --> 00:18:33,041
the night of the
army-navy game in 1945.

286
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:37,055
- Ray Takahashi was murdered?
- You that someone Skip?

287
00:18:37,353 --> 00:18:38,556
Give him a push?

288
00:18:38,557 --> 00:18:40,760
Probably were intown
for the game, right?

289
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:44,595
I was with my army buddies all
night, and I can give you names.

290
00:18:44,596 --> 00:18:45,643
Do that.

291
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:50,062
Listen, Billy was my best friend and
the Takahashis were like family to me!

292
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:55,134
Look... After Billy died I was sent
to the South Pacific and we lost touch.

293
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,454
What was in the envelope?

294
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:59,899
It was the last letter
Billy wrote before he died.

295
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,349
I found it in his things
and sent it to his family.

296
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,656
- What did it say?
- I don't know!

297
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:09,675
Listen, Billy was a brave soldier.
They all were the 442nd.

298
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:13,254
Mmh... Billy didn't seem like
your average gung-ho soldier.

299
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:18,220
He didn't want to enlist. And that broke Ray's heart.
And that's the reason Ray asked me to come visit.

300
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:23,042
I just can't wait to get
overseas and let those Nazis have it.

301
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,296
Your parents must be so proud.

302
00:19:28,182 --> 00:19:30,098
Your dad says you're not joining up.

303
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:34,882
No matter what we do, we'll
always be Japs to them.

304
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:38,203
Hey, you don't fight for this country,
you make them right about us, Billy.

305
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:40,232
What do you know about fighting?

306
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:45,015
- What?
- When you socked that guard, dad.

307
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,204
- You're supposed to stand up for yourself.
- You are, but things aren't so simple now.

308
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:52,006
Not in this world.

309
00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:54,752
They treat us like dirt, here.

310
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:57,899
How can you ask me to
fight when you won't?

311
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,883
Ray.

312
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:06,698
- You've been telling the boys in the block to enlist?
- You stay out of it, Shinji.

313
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:09,368
No, you stay out! This
country treats our children...

314
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,120
- like cage animals!
- Lower your voice...

315
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:14,468
- The guards will hear you and send you away.
- Guards!

316
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:22,136
You know what this is? Toilet
paper! Guess what we are.

317
00:20:31,172 --> 00:20:31,948
Hey!

318
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:38,929
Did he do this?

319
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,792
- Don't ask me that, guard.
- I'll ask what I want, tojo.

320
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:44,707
Did this man desecrate
the American flag?

321
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:51,639
Yes.

322
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:54,862
You worthless traitor!

323
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:59,622
You have my boy's blood on your hands.
This isn't over Ray, this isn't over!

324
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:05,246
<i>Our kids! Think about it! Our kids!</i>

325
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:21,308
I'll never forget the look on his
face. Like Billy abandoned him.

326
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:23,791
You know if Shinji and Ray
clashed again after that?

327
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:28,197
Now, Shinji was sent off to Tula Lake
that day for desecrating the flag.

328
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:29,655
I saw him leave myself.

329
00:21:37,615 --> 00:21:42,726
Looking into the 1945 murder of
Ray Takahashi. Name ring a bell?

330
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,793
We lived in that rat hole they
called the detention center.

331
00:21:47,365 --> 00:21:49,396
- So What?
- The Menzanar was no picnic.

332
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,102
- Tule Lake was even worse.
- Long interrogations,

333
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:54,663
cold weather, stockades, you put up with a lot.

334
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:57,464
All because Ray Takahashi
pinned you for a flag burner.

335
00:21:57,506 --> 00:22:01,144
Then Ray ends up dead in same city
you set your residence in.

336
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:02,562
Coincidence?

337
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,891
A lot of us came here after
the war because of the quakers.

338
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,321
They helped us get back on our feet.

339
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:12,014
My wife and I stuck.

340
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:15,654
Y'know, a guy like that, a traitor...

341
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,206
sends me away from my family...

342
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,031
I'd be pretty pissed off.

343
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,438
So maybe you get out of the Tula Lake,
swore to find your buddy Ray.

344
00:22:23,473 --> 00:22:26,142
I was still behind
barbed wire when Ray died.

345
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:28,401
Didn't get out of Tula Lake through '46,

346
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:31,562
Cause I answered no twice to the
government loyalty questionnaire.

347
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:33,329
A loyalty questionnaire?

348
00:22:33,704 --> 00:22:35,834
Asked if we'd be willing
to fight in the war.

349
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:37,924
Renounce the Japanese Emperor.

350
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:40,259
- Ah!
- And you refused to?

351
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:44,111
Didn't know the damn Emperor's name.

352
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,242
I was born here! Just like you!

353
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:54,890
As far as the government was concerned...

354
00:22:56,991 --> 00:22:58,560
I was just a Jap.

355
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,867
And so was Ray.

356
00:23:04,213 --> 00:23:05,618
But he still couldn't see it.

357
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:23,748
Hey Ray!

358
00:23:24,526 --> 00:23:26,592
- You done for the day?
- Uh, almost.

359
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:30,362
I've been reading up on
your home town, Philadelphia.

360
00:23:30,397 --> 00:23:32,270
I understand the quakers
have quite a presence there.

361
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:33,118
We do.

362
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:36,653
Maybe when this... business is over...

363
00:23:37,594 --> 00:23:40,322
- You could help me introduce me to some folks?
- Of course.

364
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,524
- I can help you find an apartment.
- I appreciate it.

365
00:23:46,262 --> 00:23:48,112
Ah, wait. I've something for you.

366
00:23:50,014 --> 00:23:52,612
Carrots. For your Victory Garden.

367
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:55,042
- You and Billy can buy at them.
- Thanks.

368
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:59,590
- Buy them on my own, today.
- Oh, busy with classes?

369
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:05,022
- Busy bliming me for the all war.
- It's that age.

370
00:24:07,591 --> 00:24:11,764
He doesn't want to enlist. Doesn't
believe in dying for this country.

371
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:15,525
Doesn't make me a better american
if part of me believes in that too?

372
00:24:15,526 --> 00:24:18,171
No, not in this place.

373
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:22,879
I always tought I'll be judged
on my character, not my skin.

374
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,158
- I was wrong.
- Ray... you have to know...

375
00:24:29,496 --> 00:24:31,486
I never saw you as the enemy.

376
00:24:32,813 --> 00:24:34,945
It's not fair that
you have to start over.

377
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:41,620
I've been starting over
my whole life. Easy as pie.

378
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,026
- Thanks.
- For what?

379
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,854
You make me forget about where we really are.

380
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:03,444
You make me forget too.

381
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:20,946
So, Ray and the quaker
were doing the dirty?

382
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:25,388
The man preached loyalty on his
soul box, but he wasn't loyal.

383
00:25:27,437 --> 00:25:29,072
At least not to his wife.

384
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:34,976
Thanks for your time.

385
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:43,745
So, Mary Ann helped Ray move
to Philly. Continue the affair?

386
00:25:43,746 --> 00:25:45,669
Or not, the affair wouldn't found out?

387
00:25:45,732 --> 00:25:48,497
Don't ?? betrayed wife, nothing
worse than a womans scorn.

388
00:25:48,498 --> 00:25:49,629
How about two?

389
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:56,821
Ray Takahashi? Haven't
heard that name in 60 years.

390
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:59,864
- Well, we're investigating his murder.
- Weren't you two pretty close? ??

391
00:25:59,996 --> 00:26:01,630
Acquaintances at best.

392
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,075
That all? Mary Ann?

393
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:08,155
- What are you implying?
- That you killed him.

394
00:26:08,842 --> 00:26:10,121
When he won't leave his wife for you.

395
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:16,156
You think I killed my husband? And
I wanted to raise a child on my own?

396
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,739
In that era, better is to be a widow
than a divorcee?

397
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:22,777
Yes. Easy.

398
00:26:23,126 --> 00:26:26,111
Or first Ray has an affair
with a white woman, next he's

399
00:26:26,112 --> 00:26:29,657
ollying you and the baby around
the country to her home town.

400
00:26:29,977 --> 00:26:32,642
Talk about a slap in
the face. I'd be angry.

401
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:36,026
I was barely 25, young, fullish...

402
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,502
So you turned to Ray
for some desert loving.

403
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:44,637
Men like Ray... are rare. Special.

404
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:47,753
What we were doing to them was wrong.

405
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,431
- You fell in love.
- No.

406
00:26:53,882 --> 00:26:55,837
We had that one kiss, that's all.

407
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,752
He said his wife was the
only woman he could ever love.

408
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:01,866
Objection on that? Kind of hurt?

409
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:03,552
Certo che ero arrabbiata.

410
00:27:05,553 --> 00:27:08,725
Ray told her I was the
only woman he could love.

411
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:11,473
- And you believed him?
- Ray was a gentleman.

412
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,396
We never spoke of it again.

413
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,651
Did his wife find out about it?

414
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:23,231
I didn't realize my one small
indiscretion would destroy his family.

415
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,670
Takahashi.

416
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:39,877
Billy! Billy!

417
00:27:40,804 --> 00:27:42,706
- What are you doing?
- Joining up.

418
00:27:42,765 --> 00:27:45,712
You're just going to leave, without
saying goodbye, not even to your mother?

419
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:48,213
- I said goodbye to her.
- What about me?

420
00:27:49,857 --> 00:27:52,998
You? You talk about being american?

421
00:27:53,573 --> 00:27:55,663
About liberty and truth?

422
00:27:55,827 --> 00:27:59,068
- But you're the biggets liar here!
- What are you talking about?

423
00:27:59,115 --> 00:28:01,698
You and that school
teacher... Everyone knows.

424
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,859
- You don't understand.
- What?

425
00:28:03,918 --> 00:28:06,605
Things aren't so simple, now?
Was that your excuse for mom, too?

426
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:10,409
You wanna be a soldier, fine. But do it
for the right reasons. This isn't about me.

427
00:28:10,445 --> 00:28:11,490
Sure it is.

428
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:16,239
It's about taking a bullet for a
Country that's turned you into a coward,

429
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:18,423
that's called me a Jap
since I can remember.

430
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,354
- You don't know what it's like.
- Don't I?

431
00:28:23,488 --> 00:28:25,943
I've been called every name in the book,

432
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:29,113
treated like dirt, and I had
to smile in the face of it,

433
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:36,093
but I've never let that destroy me, make me
run away, like you are now, son. Don't go.

434
00:28:36,493 --> 00:28:37,808
Not like this.

435
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:41,924
Too late.

436
00:28:44,742 --> 00:28:46,714
Billy! Billy!

437
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:50,249
You do not walk away from me, damn it!

438
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:54,311
I want...

439
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:56,952
I want you to...

440
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,301
I want...

441
00:29:02,004 --> 00:29:04,669
I want you to come home safe, son.

442
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:08,156
Home?

443
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:11,150
I don't have a home.

444
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:13,546
Not anymore.

445
00:29:33,217 --> 00:29:36,381
We got the news about
Billy a few months later.

446
00:29:36,463 --> 00:29:38,811
And they never got a
chance to make peace?

447
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,225
But I made sure that Ray took me up on
the offer of the job and the apartment.

448
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,690
- That was the least I could do.
- Because you were the reason Billy enlisted?

449
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:52,860
You got your apartment
because of Mary Ann's...

450
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:55,831
- generosity?
- If living that hell

451
00:29:55,889 --> 00:30:00,756
meant taking advantage of a crush some...
silly woman had on my husband, then so be it.

452
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:03,268
Any mother would have done the same.

453
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:05,053
For Barbara?

454
00:30:06,603 --> 00:30:08,041
And for my son.

455
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:13,898
I wanted him to come
home to a real home.

456
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:18,166
Not one behind bars.

457
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:22,144
But he never got that chance.

458
00:30:23,353 --> 00:30:27,580
And we'll leave in a big train and you'll
get to feel cool air instead of this...

459
00:30:28,296 --> 00:30:29,863
dusty, cold wind.

460
00:30:38,424 --> 00:30:40,315
Trying to be here soon.

461
00:30:41,912 --> 00:30:44,671
I stopped by the woodworking hut.

462
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:48,391
I've been...

463
00:30:50,047 --> 00:30:53,522
I've been making these for
you, to replace what we had.

464
00:30:54,732 --> 00:30:57,978
Plus, the next time you'll get
mad at me, they won't break.

465
00:30:59,962 --> 00:31:02,751
I guess it's time for the back up plan.

466
00:31:02,892 --> 00:31:05,063
- Don't give up?
- Don't give up.

467
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:07,482
On us.

468
00:31:09,443 --> 00:31:10,946
You're my own life,

469
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:15,502
you're the only thing
that kept me going, here.

470
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:25,786
We use 'em in Philadelphia, in our new
home, when Billy returns, the four of us.

471
00:31:27,064 --> 00:31:28,543
The four of us?

472
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:33,169
I like the sound of that.

473
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:36,645
It's time to go.

474
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,783
Ray, what is it?

475
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:20,763
Ray?

476
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:24,638
Ray?

477
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:39,936
That's how they told
us our son was dead.

478
00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:43,036
In a telegram.

479
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,267
I'm sorry.

480
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:55,405
It breaks my heart that Ray and
Billy died angry at each other.

481
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,072
It broke Ray's too.

482
00:33:03,318 --> 00:33:06,594
We weren't the only family
that got a telegram that day.

483
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:09,071
Shinji's family got one.

484
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,250
Shinji Nakamura?

485
00:33:16,507 --> 00:33:20,176
The neighbor who went to Tule
Lake? His son was in the Army?

486
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:22,266
One of the first to enlist.

487
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:25,213
Ray... talked him into it.

488
00:33:28,547 --> 00:33:30,990
All right, I got Shinji's
Tule Lake records.

489
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:32,992
- Alibi check up?
- No.

490
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,728
Shinji wasn't realesed
in 1946 like he said.

491
00:33:35,786 --> 00:33:39,256
Got out on november 23rd, 1945.

492
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,551
- A few days before Ray was killed.
- Even better.

493
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,522
He used a train ticket the government
bought him... to head to Philly.

494
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:46,312
But his wife was in California.

495
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:50,222
And you don't travel 3,000
miles just to say hello.

496
00:33:54,322 --> 00:33:57,715
"You have blood on your hands, convincing
our boys to fight. This isn't over."

497
00:33:57,751 --> 00:34:00,299
Wasn't just any blood Ray had
on his hands, it was your son's.

498
00:34:00,322 --> 00:34:03,657
My son would've done anything
to prove he was american.

499
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:06,063
- He got his wish.
- But doesn't change the fact that

500
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,217
you were in Philadelphia
when Ray was murdered.

501
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:11,253
See? We make our threats too.

502
00:34:11,528 --> 00:34:15,344
- Checked the record at Tule Lake.
- 25 bucks and a ticket to Philly.

503
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:23,729
- I came here to see Ray, but I didn't kill him.
- Then why lie?

504
00:34:24,903 --> 00:34:28,549
Frankly? Not a lot of faith
in the american justice system.

505
00:34:28,596 --> 00:34:30,651
Point taken. Doesn't
answer the question.

506
00:34:30,686 --> 00:34:32,758
I came here to give him Billy's letter.

507
00:34:32,794 --> 00:34:35,212
They were long gone when
the letter got to Manzanar.

508
00:34:35,259 --> 00:34:38,623
- Didn't realize you two were Bosom Buddies.
- We weren't.

509
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,004
But Ray paid the same
price I did to this Country.

510
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:44,552
A son.

511
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:52,162
He deserved to have that letter.

512
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:56,811
- And I had a question to ask him.
- What question?

513
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,250
How to go on.

514
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,436
But it was clear, he no
longer had any answers for me.

515
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:24,013
Ray...

516
00:35:26,702 --> 00:35:28,369
What are you doing here?

517
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:36,471
This letter came to Manzanar after you
left. My wife wanted to make sure you got it.

518
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:41,220
I don't want anything from that place.

519
00:35:42,453 --> 00:35:44,015
It's from Billy.

520
00:35:46,152 --> 00:35:47,420
Billy's gone.

521
00:35:53,577 --> 00:35:56,642
They're saying they can't
send my boy's body home,

522
00:35:56,724 --> 00:35:58,667
for at least another year.

523
00:35:59,112 --> 00:36:03,386
Do you know what I'd do for
a letter? Anything, from him?

524
00:36:04,995 --> 00:36:07,038
They already tore it down,

525
00:36:07,977 --> 00:36:09,046
the camp.

526
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:12,022
Like it never existed.

527
00:36:14,243 --> 00:36:17,103
My son died for a country
that tosses us out seems

528
00:36:17,132 --> 00:36:18,665
like the kitchen garbage.

529
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,575
I'm not surprising they don't
remember our boys names.

530
00:36:31,153 --> 00:36:32,684
They were heroes.

531
00:36:33,836 --> 00:36:38,329
And this country should give our boys
the medals they deserve.

532
00:36:41,153 --> 00:36:43,383
Can they bring him back to me, Shinji?

533
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:47,183
Can they do that?

534
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,906
Shinji, wait! Shinji!

535
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:20,175
He said he was going to give Billy his medal.

536
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:22,983
Change his mind, just like that?

537
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,010
After he read Billy's letter...

538
00:37:26,135 --> 00:37:27,968
That's why he was ahead at the stadium,

539
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:29,796
Army-Navy.

540
00:37:30,107 --> 00:37:33,452
Ray wasn't giving up the Distinguish
Black Medal that night.

541
00:37:35,177 --> 00:37:36,796
Billy deserved the medal,

542
00:37:40,602 --> 00:37:42,339
and your son did too.

543
00:37:48,218 --> 00:37:50,759
Threw himself on a granade
to save his batallion.

544
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:52,570
One brave kid.

545
00:37:52,892 --> 00:37:56,409
His dad's last wish was to see him honored for it.

546
00:37:57,834 --> 00:37:59,667
Isn't this what we speak for?

547
00:38:00,536 --> 00:38:03,324
People like Billy... Ray...

548
00:38:05,446 --> 00:38:07,654
are you sure you can walk away
from them, boss?

549
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:20,508
If Ray wanted the son to get that medal, he
needed a nomination from his commanding officer

550
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,512
Billy's friend, Skip?

551
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,356
He was at the Army-Navy game that night.

552
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:33,345
France, Italy, South Pacific.

553
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,325
Two brown stars and a purple heart.

554
00:38:39,905 --> 00:38:41,417
You were quite a soldier, Skip.

555
00:38:43,251 --> 00:38:44,913
Call me Eugene.

556
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,353
I served in Vietnam my self.

557
00:38:49,714 --> 00:38:52,909
- You hurt more than we did.
- War is war, all right?

558
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:57,744
I had a buddy in there, Manny Hijshoj
filippino guy.

559
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,713
There we were fighiting off vietcong and
I'm stuck with a guy that look just like the enemy.

560
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:04,086
Were really odds, right?

561
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:07,698
A soldier is a soldier.

562
00:39:07,896 --> 00:39:11,681
Manny prove themeselves to be: he died
to save another guy in our unit.

563
00:39:11,943 --> 00:39:12,704
A hero.

564
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:16,853
Once we were on patrol we got caught in an ambush.

565
00:39:18,337 --> 00:39:19,763
We got tore up pretty bad.

566
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:23,607
When the smoke cleared, I saw this Gook running towards me.

567
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,983
I came this close to kill him.

568
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:31,470
- But he was Manny.
- Why are you doing me this?

569
00:39:32,627 --> 00:39:34,128
Billy was your bestfriend.

570
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:37,763
Yes, he was.

571
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:40,635
A first-rate guy.

572
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,467
So what happened?

573
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,549
When he died you were shipped at the South Pacific.

574
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:53,259
You saw kamikazes ruin your ships,
POW Camps ruin your friends.

575
00:39:53,328 --> 00:39:56,180
- I get it Eugene, believe me.
- There's nothing to get.

576
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:02,081
They want you to come back
to this world

577
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,947
and be the same
as when you left.

578
00:40:04,021 --> 00:40:04,814
But you are not.

579
00:40:06,122 --> 00:40:08,197
Ray Takahashi appealed

580
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:11,135
to Skip, the boy he knew in California.

581
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:12,989
But Skip was gone.

582
00:40:21,297 --> 00:40:24,808
Fight for your life every day,

583
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:27,895
yeah, you know they're out there.

584
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:31,851
And those faces... hating you.

585
00:40:31,872 --> 00:40:33,684
Faces that look like Billy and like Ray.

586
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:36,418
That's why they put them in these camps!

587
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:41,569
They didn't deserve medals,
they were the enemy.

588
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,123
Skip!

589
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:06,777
Go on, catch up with the rest later.

590
00:41:12,485 --> 00:41:13,515
I need to talk to you.

591
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:16,184
I can't... shipping back out tomorrow.

592
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:21,019
It's about Billy. He deserves the
Distinguish Black Medal.

593
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,399
Those medals are for american heroes.

594
00:41:24,245 --> 00:41:25,907
It's what he was, you know it.

595
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:28,175
Billy sacrificed him self
to save others.

596
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,094
So what you people do, isn't it?

597
00:41:31,304 --> 00:41:33,395
Kamikazes, suicide mission,

598
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:34,950
- Skip...
- Kill yourselves,

599
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:37,084
and take good innocent people with you.

600
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:39,216
A Jap is a Jap.

601
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,081
What happened to you over there?

602
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:46,957
Why send this letter if he
didn't care about us anymore?

603
00:41:47,927 --> 00:41:50,628
Read this, read this and tell me it's a lie.

604
00:41:51,432 --> 00:41:52,375
Stop!

605
00:41:53,045 --> 00:41:54,557
- Tell me those boys weren't heroes.
- Stop!

606
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:57,591
- And Billy doesn't deserve that medal.
- Go home, Jap!

607
00:41:58,572 --> 00:42:03,482
I am home. My boy was more american
than you'll ever be.

608
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,423
<i>Dear dad,</i>

609
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,061
<i>it's the night before we go in the
battle, and i can't sleep.</i>

610
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:39,411
<i>Even in my dreams I hear
the artillery and I'm so afraid.</i>

611
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:46,409
<i>When I need to be brave,</i>

612
00:42:46,995 --> 00:42:48,560
<i>I think of you, dad.</i>

613
00:42:50,297 --> 00:42:53,020
<i>And your strenght in the world
that's no longer simple.</i>

614
00:42:57,013 --> 00:42:59,189
<i>Sometimes I dream I'm home again,</i>

615
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:04,534
<i>drawing pictures of you,
mom and little Barbara.</i>

616
00:43:06,538 --> 00:43:08,296
<i>And none of us behind bars,</i>

617
00:43:10,107 --> 00:43:12,177
<i>because in my dreams we are free.</i>

618
00:43:19,354 --> 00:43:21,627
<i>I know now that's why I'm here:</i>

619
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:26,987
<i>it's not about who I'm fighting against
but who I'm fighting for:</i>

620
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:31,729
<i>you dad.</i>

621
00:43:34,608 --> 00:43:36,946
<i>I want your dream's America could be.</i>

622
00:43:38,773 --> 00:43:40,190
<i>Should be.</i>

623
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:43,614
<i>I see all of us in this battle field,</i>

624
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,607
<i>white, black, brown, yellow...</i>

625
00:43:48,717 --> 00:43:50,378
<i>and that's the America I know.</i>

626
00:43:53,004 --> 00:43:55,149
<i>Maybe one day I'll see you there, dad.</i>

627
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:05,256
<i>Love,</i>

628
00:44:05,798 --> 00:44:08,110
<i>your son, Billy.</i>
