1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,983
* So take these words *

2
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:24,642
* And sing out loud *

3
00:00:24,677 --> 00:00:28,232
* 'Cause everyone *

4
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:31,539
Max! Max!
* Is forgiven now *

5
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,335
Ma'am, ma'am, stay back.

6
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:34,567
Go on the other side
of the street.

7
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,407
My baby's in there! My son!

8
00:00:36,408 --> 00:00:37,703
Where is he?
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,665
He's just a little baby!
What floor?

10
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:41,739
Hey, we got a kid in there!
Radio Mcllroy.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,818
Ma'am, what floor?

12
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:44,772
The fourth floor!
4F! Fourth!

13
00:00:44,773 --> 00:00:45,609
4F! 4F!
Mcllroy!

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,838
Mcllroy, fourth floor...

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,681
* And it's someplace simple
where we could live *

16
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:55,748
* Something only you can give *

17
00:00:55,783 --> 00:00:59,015
* And that's faith and trust *

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,247
* And peace while we're alive *

19
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:05,046
No, no...

20
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:09,314
* Andhe one poor child
who saved this world... *

21
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,983
My baby!

22
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,945
No!

23
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:15,845
* If we all just stopped *

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,813
* And said a prayer for them. *

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,083
Oh, my God,
my baby!

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,346
My baby Max!

27
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:43,516
Central Detectives picked this
lady up a few hours ago.

28
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:45,666
Said she went nuts
in Rittenhouse Square.

29
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,894
Scared the pants off
some dudes feeding the birds.

30
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:50,441
Ex-junkie.
She still using?

31
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,080
Don't know.
Sure acting that way.

32
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:55,448
Screaming she knows something
about a job from '05. Oh, boy.

33
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,923
This should be a waste of time.

34
00:01:56,924 --> 00:01:58,869
Lot of people you give
the benefit of the doubt,

35
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,680
but not addicts, huh?

36
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:02,689
I was raised by one.

37
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:04,610
Got no illusions left.

38
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:06,561
Heads up.
Trouble's coming.

39
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:08,175
Hey, ladies.

40
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:09,189
Tombs are the place

41
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:10,660
to be today, huh?
I got a stimulating

42
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:13,079
conversation to look
forward to, few cells down.

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,158
Priscilla Chapin.

44
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,741
Oh, smackhead zombie.
I know her.

45
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:17,134
You know all the screw-ups,
Saccardo.

46
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:18,641
Hey, they make me feel
good about myself.

47
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:21,529
Got hauled in for disorderly
conduct this morning.

48
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,730
Says she's got a tip.

49
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:23,852
Yeah, waste of your time.

50
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,270
That's what I said.

51
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:29,371
You're making a mistake!

52
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:30,877
I need to get out of here!

53
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:32,552
This is...

54
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,139
Morning, Priscilla.

55
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,464
Detectives Miller and Rush.

56
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:42,974
I got to get out of here.

57
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:44,281
You've got to help me.

58
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:46,042
You've got to get me out
of here. Yeah? 'Cause, uh,

59
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:47,695
we heard you had
information on a homicide,

60
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:48,885
but if you got
an appointment...

61
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:50,695
It's about my son.
Says here that

62
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:53,845
the apartment you were living in
in 2005 burned to the ground

63
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,490
with your eight-month-old
son in it.

64
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:57,037
Ruled accidental death.

65
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,073
Not a murder.

66
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:01,033
I saw him this morning
in the park.

67
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:03,819
You saw your son?

68
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,854
Yeah. Max was on the playground.

69
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:08,581
I know it was him.

70
00:03:08,582 --> 00:03:09,905
I- I ran over to him,

71
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:11,781
but th he was
gone in the crowd.

72
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:13,189
You using again,
Priscilla?

73
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,321
No.

74
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:16,116
No. I...

75
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:17,298
I'm clean.

76
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,914
When I got pregnant,
I did 90 meetings in 90 days.

77
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:23,679
I haven't used since.

78
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:25,519
So how's it make sense,

79
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,958
your son being
in the park today?

80
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,395
It's not what
they thought it was.

81
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,219
That fire...
Well, they blamed it on you.

82
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,899
Left the gas stove
on in your apartment.

83
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,202
It was cold.
The heat didn't work.

84
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:37,116
Sometimes
I put the stove on.

85
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,384
You left your baby alone
that night to...

86
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,170
"grab some cigarettes
at the bodega. "

87
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,377
Came back,

88
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:44,488
fire had taken everything.

89
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,186
Just some cigarettes, huh?

90
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,538
Should've prosecuted you
for negligent

91
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:48,914
homicide, Priscilla.

92
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:50,825
I didn't turn the gas on.

93
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:52,203
Not that night.

94
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:54,091
So who did?

95
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:55,427
I don't know.

96
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:56,668
Somebody else.

97
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,794
When you
figure it out,

98
00:03:57,795 --> 00:04:00,000
holler at us.
I'm out.

99
00:04:01,405 --> 00:04:03,877
Please, you got
to believe me.

100
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:05,692
I saw my son.

101
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:07,418
His name is Max.

102
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,432
He has sandy hair
and he has

103
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:11,042
a birthmark
on his right arm!

104
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,217
It was him in the park!

105
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:17,223
We'll take a look.

106
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,492
Any truth to what you're saying,

107
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:21,768
we'll find it.

111

<i>What do you got
from Rittenhouse Square</i>

112
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:00,914
that points to
Priscilla Chapin's son?

113
00:05:00,915 --> 00:05:03,313
I tracked down only two kids
there this morning,

114
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:04,352
eight and ten.

115
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:05,186
Too old.

116
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:06,786
Coroner's report
tells it all, though.

117
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:08,725
"Blast threw Max Chapin
out of his crib,

118
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,745
"fractured his bones.
Blaze got everything

119
00:05:10,746 --> 00:05:12,210
but the skeleton. "
Gas fire?

120
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,297
February 12, 2005.

121
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:17,816
Time PFD got it under control,
252 Baker Street

122
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,791
burned to the ground.

123
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:21,171
All the tenants
got out except the baby.

124
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:22,951
Mom told the police
she left him alone

125
00:05:22,952 --> 00:05:23,906
for ten minutes.

126
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,824
A neighbor had the baby monitor.

127
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,354
That's her
babysitting solution?

128
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:29,564
This Priscilla
has possession charges.

129
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:32,066
'01, '02 and '04.

130
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:33,208
A teenage runaway.

131
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:34,855
Avoided juvie by doing rehab.

132
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:35,965
Baby's father in the picture?

133
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,559
Mom said he was AWOL,

134
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,731
never even met the kid.

135
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:40,564
No one listed on the
birth certificate.

136
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:43,554
Louie!
Didn't have to dress up for us.

137
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:44,539
If not for you,

138
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,141
then who, Rush?
Me, clearly.

139
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:48,277
What's your take
on the Baker Street

140
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:49,898
fire, Louie?
Well, right here's

141
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,978
the source
of the gas leak.

142
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:53,223
The kitchen.

143
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,901
Neighbors said Priscilla Chapin
had a habit of leaving

144
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:58,298
the gas stove on.
Hinky thing?

145
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:00,049
I'm seeing alligator patterns

146
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,339
in that room
right over here.

147
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,223
The baby's room.

148
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:03,849
Yup.
What do you mean "alligator"?

149
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,320
On the walls,
if fire burns really hot

150
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:08,602
or burns it for a long
time, it does it, but...

151
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:10,132
But if the fire started
in the kitchen,

152
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,034
that's where you should see them. Right.

153
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:16,397
So the fire marshal had it
wrong in '05.

154
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,530
sn't an accident?

155
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:19,426
Look, the gas came
from the stove.

156
00:06:19,427 --> 00:06:21,490
It caused
the blast, you know?

157
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:23,055
But there was a fire
burning in that kid's

158
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:24,270
room before the explosion.

159
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:25,656
So how's that happen?
An eight-month-old doesn't

160
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:28,884
play with matches.
Have a talk with the firefighter

161
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:31,738
who found the baby; see what
he remembers from that bedroom.

162
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:35,453
McILROY: You're saying the
fire started in the baby's room?

163
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:38,373
That's one theory.

164
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:41,338
Depends on what you saw.

165
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:44,652
You remember
a candle, incense?

166
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,570
Anything might've sparked
a fire in that room?

167
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:48,737
Anything incendiary
wasn't eaten up by then,

168
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:50,800
I- I wod've reported it,
but, uh...

169
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,167
Right.

170
00:06:54,174 --> 00:06:55,608
I'm sorry, guys.

171
00:06:56,773 --> 00:06:57,913
It's a tough
memory to shake,

172
00:06:57,914 --> 00:06:59,286
seeing a kid die like that.

173
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:01,302
Yeah, my daughter
had just been born,

174
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:04,415
so, uh...
Know you did the best you could.

175
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,262
Heading in there, I, I...

176
00:07:07,513 --> 00:07:09,249
I didn't know what I'd find.

177
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,445
I've seen places...

178
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:41,481
junkies let their kids
sleep on the floor.

179
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:43,303
There's trash everywhere.

180
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,840
Not this kid.

181
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,061
This one was loved.

182
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:48,272
There was glass

183
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:50,073
on the floor?
From the window.

184
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:51,609
It was broken.

185
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:53,208
If it got broke

186
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,717
the blast,
it should've blown out...

187
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:57,095
onto the fire escape.

188
00:07:57,096 --> 00:07:59,162
Well, it was inside
the apartment, for sure.

189
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:01,583
I almost cut myself
getting that kid out.

190
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:04,114
The window wasn't
broken in the blast.

191
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:07,642
Someone busted into that room,
started that fire.

192
00:08:07,643 --> 00:08:09,873
And this just became a homicide.

193
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:12,554
<i>Owner of 252 Baker</i>

194
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:14,565
got $925,000

195
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:16,382
in insurance money
when the place burned down.

196
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,745
That neighborhood?

197
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,383
Couldn't have gotten
that on the market

198
00:08:19,384 --> 00:08:20,748
if he wallpapered in gold.

199
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:22,151
Victor Martinez.

200
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:23,914
He's got two condos
in Mt. Airy,

201
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:25,263
and a high-rise downtown.

202
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:27,882
So 252 Baker's the eyesore.

203
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:29,228
Makes motive.

204
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,528
Licenses and Inspections

205
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,106
sent these over
a couple minutes ago.

206
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:34,337
Code violations filed
against the landlord

207
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:35,874
by the tenant in 4F.

208
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,085
That Priscilla?
Yep.

209
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:38,167
Said the heat wasn't working

210
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:39,266
in the dead of winter.

211
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:40,917
"Unsanitary conditions. "

212
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,325
That can bring a hefty fine.
Or worse,

213
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:44,637
guy gets sued by the city.

214
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:46,535
Loses those condos.

215
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,811
That fire could've
killed two birds

216
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:50,608
with one stone for you, Victor.

217
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,207
Get some cash
from that rat trap.

218
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,327
Finished off your pain
in the ass tenant,

219
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:58,016
Priscilla Chapin.
Excuse me?

220
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:00,701
What about me being a member
of the Chamber of Commerce,

221
00:09:00,702 --> 00:09:02,157
and a Catholic,
makes you think

222
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:03,853
that I would take the life
of a child?

223
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:05,921
That part was, uh...

224
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:08,988
unfortunate.

225
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,759
But you're a
businessman, Victor.

226
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,521
And that neighborhood,
wasn't getting

227
00:09:12,522 --> 00:09:13,970
any better.
For your information,

228
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,399
I had an interested buyer,

229
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,791
and I would've made
more than the insurance.

230
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:18,928
That's real concrete.

231
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,433
You want the truth?

232
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,525
Yeah, Priscilla Chapin's
the reason

233
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:25,184
my property
got burnt to a crisp.

234
00:09:25,185 --> 00:09:28,248
By leaving the stove on? I'm
talking about her lifestyle, man.

235
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:31,348
Tried to go clean for the baby.

236
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:34,689
Once that bed is
made... you know.

237
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:37,082
Tough to leave
the addict life behind.

238
00:09:37,214 --> 00:09:38,398
So she start using again?

239
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,742
She was white-knuckling it.

240
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:41,910
Trying to turn her life around.

241
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:45,596
Some people didn't
want to get left behind.

242
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,527
Please stop crying.

243
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:54,587
It's time to go
to sleep now, baby.

244
00:09:57,408 --> 00:09:58,765
There, that's better?

245
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,781
You love the dryer,
don't you?

246
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:02,650
Please, please,

247
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,117
please, I'm so tired.

248
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:07,473
Honey, shh...

249
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:08,692
People said

250
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:09,740
you were dead.

251
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:11,149
Priscilla...

252
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,531
But I knew you was laying low.

253
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,724
Look, man...

254
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,621
I, uh, I had a baby,

255
00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:28,442
Franklin.
So?

256
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,111
I'm going to get a job.

257
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,207
A part-time job,
and I will pay you back.

258
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,646
Don't got to pay me back
like that, girl.

259
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,662
I'm, I'm clean.

260
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:43,190
I'm a mom now.

261
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,819
Then I need cash.

262
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:47,263
Three days.

263
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:50,308
And if you fail to uphold
our business agreement,

264
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:52,489
then I might have
to get creative.

265
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,963
He's cute.

266
00:10:57,964 --> 00:10:59,863
It's okay, Max.

267
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:02,730
We're going to be okay.

268
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:08,394
It's nice of you
to intervene there, Vic.

269
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:09,734
Are you nuts?

270
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:11,304
You know who
that guy is?

271
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:12,784
Franklin Palmer.

272
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:14,670
Big-time crack and
heroin dealer.

273
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:16,713
He's a real humanitarian.

274
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:18,736
You didn't hear this all
from me, all right?

275
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,999
Oh, relax.
He's in prison now.

276
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,501
Yeah, for torching the house
of one of his enemies.

277
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,560
You threatened
Priscilla Chapin

278
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,446
to give you your money
back or else.

279
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:35,831
Week later,
her apartment

280
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:37,236
building goes up
in flames.

281
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:39,481
You realize her kid died
in that fire?

282
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:41,554
I do.

283
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,824
Sometimes God plucks the most
beautiful flowers.

284
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:47,319
You wouldn't
be gettin' sarcastic

285
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,947
about a kid dyin', would ya? No, man.

286
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:50,977
Look,

287
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:53,613
I don't take severe measures
with that kinda

288
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:55,619
repeat customer.
Priscilla was clean.

289
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,453
She wasn't coming
back to you.

290
00:11:57,454 --> 00:11:58,396
So maybe you
took away

291
00:11:58,397 --> 00:11:59,363
the thing she loved.

292
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:01,848
Smack is what she loved, dawg.

293
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:02,800
H is a pleasure

294
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:05,458
like you c't f fd
in this world.

295
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,714
Give that up for
a crying baby

296
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:09,429
and a fast
food job?

297
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:11,213
No contest.

298
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,551
Saying Priscilla fell
off the wagon?

299
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:14,182
Sayin' whole point
of usin'

300
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:16,257
is to escape reality.

301
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:18,185
And that girl's

302
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:20,927
reality was bleak.

303
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:31,065
* I'm not in love
with the modern world *

304
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:43,231
* I was a torch driving
the savages back to the trees *

305
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:46,465
* Modern world has
more ways... *

306
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:49,127
Have you seen Ellis?

307
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:51,913
What're you doing here,
Chantelle? I'm working.

308
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:53,058
He ain't been around.

309
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:54,750
I don't know, I think
maybe he left me.

310
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:56,624
He's no good, Chantelle.

311
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,372
He can't stay with anyone
longer than two weeks anyway.

312
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:01,218
Look, I gotta get back
to work...

313
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:02,735
I'm thinkin' maybe
it's 'cause of you.

314
00:13:02,736 --> 00:13:05,223
'Cause I know you been
calling about that baby.

315
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:07,215
You better stay
away from him!

316
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:09,903
He needs to own up
to his responsibilities...

317
00:13:09,904 --> 00:13:12,909
He don't want you
or your kid.

318
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,589
He probably ain't
even the father,

319
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,767
he don't owe you squat!

320
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:18,799
He is the father
and he will help us.

321
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,388
You know what?
You see him around?

322
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:22,567
You tell him I'm going to
the cops if he doesn't own up.

323
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,809
Stay away from him!

324
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,014
I'll kill you, bitch! Hey!

325
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:27,048
Get out! Get out!

326
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,217
I'll break...

327
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:29,802
Out of this store!

328
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:37,256
Priscilla, that's it.

329
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,411
No.
You, too.

330
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:39,292
ease. Please.

331
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:40,675
Matt, I...

332
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:42,618
I need this job!

333
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:48,971
It was only a matter of time
before she came callin',

334
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:51,507
except I got locked up
a few days later.

335
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:53,042
Who was the crackhead?

336
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:54,137
Man, I don't know, man.

337
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:55,615
You know, all them fiends
be the same.

338
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:56,438
Got me.

339
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,363
And the baby's daddy?
Ellis?

340
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:00,470
Do I look like 411, dawg?

341
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:02,430
I don't know,

342
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:04,322
skinny white boy.

343
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:06,327
Be surprised
if he's still kickin' it.

344
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:08,164
Short shelf life,
these types.

345
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:08,998
Especially

346
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:11,358
with Franklin here
pushing 'em off.

347
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:17,134
Why haven't you found Max?
I don't understand.

348
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:19,231
We need to talk
about Max's father.

349
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:20,442
Ellis.

350
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:22,154
Ellis? Why?
'Cause back

351
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:23,229
in the day
you told his girl

352
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,631
you were gonna
rat him out,

353
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:26,046
get his ass
tossed in jail

354
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,062
if he didn't
pay up.

355
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:29,104
Ellis was broke, okay?

356
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:30,921
We were in love with
dope, not each other.

357
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:32,605
He never even
met Max.

358
00:14:32,676 --> 00:14:33,348
You need to find

359
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:35,222
my son.
He's out there.

360
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,625
There was no four-year-old boy

361
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:39,966
at that park.
Yes, there was.

362
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:42,119
Is there a reason
you're protecting Ellis?

363
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,430
Maybe he came back,
hurt your kid?

364
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,376
That first night
in the hospital,

365
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:53,460
when Max was born,

366
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:59,181
they, uh, they put him in this
little plastic thing next to me.

367
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:02,702
And he started to cry
in the middle of the night.

368
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,455
He was all
swaddled up.

369
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:07,771
And I took it all off of him,

370
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,380
all those layers

371
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:13,228
and I put him right here
on my heart,

372
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:15,612
skin to skin.

373
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:18,457
And I felt him

374
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,075
start to breathe
like me.

375
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:25,844
It's the first time I ever felt
like I had something to give.

376
00:15:27,353 --> 00:15:31,757
I would never allow anyone
to hurt him.

377
00:15:41,878 --> 00:15:43,341
You called?

378
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:45,613
Uh, Ellis Smith.

379
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:47,019
Know him?

380
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,519
Of him, yeah.

381
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,243
Guy'd sell his mama
for a fix.

382
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:51,904
Oh, where can I find him?

383
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:54,668
He's a user nomad.

384
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:55,782
I hear his sister pays for him

385
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:58,029
to go into the Maloney-Smith
Center every once in a while,

386
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,127
make a half-assed attempt
to get clean.

387
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:01,914
Real winners you hang with,
Saccardo.

388
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:05,394
Hey, you know, you find Ellis,
keep him for me.

389
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:06,809
I got a Mexican
trafficking thing

390
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,973
I want to conversate with him
about, a'ight?

391
00:16:08,974 --> 00:16:10,475
A'ight.

392
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:18,827
What? Why're you workin' this job?

393
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:20,751
How make the big bucks.
You got a thing

394
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:22,002
for kid jobs?

395
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:23,079
Or addicts?

396
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,824
Or is it the combo
platter-

397
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:26,459
kids with addict moms?

398
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:28,921
Just doing my job, Saccardo.

399
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,650
That's it.

400
00:16:38,517 --> 00:16:39,494
<i>I saw Ellis here</i>

401
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:41,593
at the clinic around
Thanksgiving maybe?

402
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:42,927
Not since then, no.

403
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:45,156
Well, he ever mention anything
about his son?

404
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:46,947
The one who died.

405
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:48,209
Ellis is an addict.

406
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,215
He doesn't have a lot
of lucid moments,

407
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:52,801
especially of, I's say,
accountability.

408
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:54,090
What about the baby's mother?

409
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:56,018
Oh, she came by here once,

410
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:58,136
to visit him with the
baby. Priscilla was here?

411
00:16:58,137 --> 00:17:00,841
Mmm. On hands and knees.
Like Ellis was any kind of help.

412
00:17:00,842 --> 00:17:02,726
She make any threats
about going to the cops?

413
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:04,350
Not that I know of.

414
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:05,773
You know Ellis
pretty well.

415
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,527
I mean, rehab gets intimate.

416
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,870
Well, yes, it can.

417
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:10,713
When they're honest.

418
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:12,682
He seem like the type
who'd hurt his kid?

419
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:13,801
Hurt him?

420
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:15,606
You mean set that fire?

421
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,477
I know that for addicts,
serving their addiction

422
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:20,681
is more important than anything.

423
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,546
More than their own life.

424
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:24,785
Or the life of their child.

425
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:35,941
Max is really sick,

426
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:36,949
Ellis.

427
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,697
I swiped baby
aspirin,

428
00:17:38,698 --> 00:17:40,630
'cause I lost my job.

429
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,847
But it's not working.
I need to take him to a doctor.

430
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:46,752
Why do you want to lay it
all on me, Priscilla?

431
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:47,960
Look at where
I'm at.

432
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:49,960
You think this is easy for me?

433
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:53,604
I'm trying everything I can
to stay clean.

434
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,362
Everything.

435
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:57,818
You're the only one
I can ask for help.

436
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,597
I never said I
wanted a kid.

437
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,431
Well, here he is.

438
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:06,359
Look at him.

439
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:10,239
He's the most amazing thing

440
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,030
in the whole world.

441
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:14,665
* You'll knock on my door
and up we'll go *

442
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:18,017
He's got snot all over his face.

443
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,292
Ellis.

444
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:22,783
Visiting hour's over,

445
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:23,861
okay?

446
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:32,913
Call you.

447
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,889
I can't-

448
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,223
It's stuck.

449
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:51,102
It's a cute onesie.

450
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:52,575
Made it yourself?

451
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:53,700
Yeah.

452
00:18:54,495 --> 00:18:55,695
Keeps me busy
at night.

453
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:57,216
Making stuff for him.

454
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:00,065
He likes flowers.

455
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:06,036
Tough times.
The nights.

456
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:08,909
They don't tell you
how hard it's going to be.

457
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:09,957
You know?

458
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:12,815
I just...

459
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:14,629
I just wish
someone had told me.

460
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,600
She was in a bad way,

461
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,200
poor girl.

462
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Not a lot
of resources

463
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,100
for someone trying to stay sober
while raising an infant.

464
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,200
No money, no babysitter,
nothin'.

465
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,600
I've got a four-year-old.

466
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,200
And the limits of your sanity
are pushed.

467
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,700
But I've got
a great husband,

468
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,800
and a job.

469
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,600
Priscilla was all alone.

470
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,700
<i>Single mother</i>

471
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,800
at the end of her rope,
no one left to turn to.

472
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,700
So why'd she lie about
going to Ellis

473
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,200
if she wasn't
protecting him?

474
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,000
'Cause maybe it wasn't him
she was protecting.

475
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,800
Had the coroner
take a second look

476
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
at the autopsy photos
of Max.

477
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Anything new?

478
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,700
Bone fractures
from the blast,

479
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
baby got tossed
around.

480
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,100
But some of 'em are showing
calcification.

481
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,600
Healing.

482
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,100
Meaning those
fractures are old.

483
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,100
We'd know more
if we had a body, but...

484
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,300
looks like Max was being abused.

485
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Seems like Priscilla
couldn't make a go of it.

486
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Abusing the kid,
goes too far one night.

487
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,800
Sets the fire to
cover it up.

488
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Should've held her
from day one.

489
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,900
Now Priscilla's in the wind.
Work says it's been two days.

490
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,300
She's probably under a bridge
somewhere.

491
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,100
Back with Ellis?

492
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,600
More like guilt creeping up.

493
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,600
Hmm.

494
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,800
She just bought this.

495
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,800
Doesn't add up.

496
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,100
All this.

497
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,300
The abuse.

498
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,200
Seems like

499
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,900
- she loved that kid.
- Loves her drugs

500
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,900
more.

501
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,400
Kids always lose out.

502
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,000
But we know Priscilla
wasn't using anymore.

503
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
Not back then,
at least.

504
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,800
She left him that night, though.

505
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,600
All alone.

506
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,400
They think you're too young
to notice,

507
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,700
to care.

508
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,300
You won't remember.

509
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,500
You do.

510
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,200
The postmark's from last week.

511
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,000
Who's Priscilla know
on the Main Line?

512
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,800
Hmm.

513
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Look at that.

514
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,600
That's the same
address.

515
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,300
Whoever that is,

516
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,600
they've been sendin' her checks
she don't cash.

517
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,900
I wish we could tell you
where our daughter is,

518
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,400
but we've been
out of contact with her

519
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,600
for almost four years.

520
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,300
Because of her
drug problem?

521
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,700
We sent her to an
excellent detox program

522
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
when she was a senior
in high school.

523
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,100
She relapsed, we tried again.

524
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,800
She ran away.

525
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,400
I have to ask you
a delicate question,

526
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,900
Mr. and Mrs. Chapin.

527
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,400
Do you think Priscilla was
capable of hurting her child?

528
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,600
Max?

529
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,600
- You want to say no, but... 
- No!

530
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm sorry we
couldn't

531
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,200
be more helpful.

532
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,600
I can show you out.

533
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,100
Thanks for your time.

534
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,500
You send her money, Julie.

535
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,700
I know.

536
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,600
No way any mom can shut out
her child completely.

537
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,900
We need to find Priscilla.

538
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,700
She never cashes those checks.

539
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Sometimes she takes
my calls.

540
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,700
Sometimes.

541
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,000
Do you know where she is?

542
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,400
I wouldn't know.
She doesn't trust me.

543
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,300
And I don't blame her.

544
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,400
We turned her away, you see.

545
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,100
Right before the fire.

546
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,700
I'd... like to borrow some money

547
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,700
to, uh, take him
to a good doctor,

548
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,200
to help us move
into a clean, safe apartment,

549
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,500
and, uh, I understand you
probably feel weird about that.

550
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,800
And I... I wouldn't ask
if it was just for me.

551
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,100
There is no realistic long-term
plan for you and this child.

552
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,800
But Max is the only reason
why I'm not using.

553
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,600
He saved my life.

554
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,600
There are people who can give
this child what he needs.

555
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,300
We can help you find them.

556
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,500
What?

557
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,400
No.

558
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,000
I love him.

559
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,400
He... he loves me, you know.

560
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,200
Maybe that's
not good enough.

561
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,600
His parents are
drug addicts.

562
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,400
He may not be...
what you want in a son.

563
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,500
Have you ever
thought of that?

564
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
But Max is perfect.

565
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,600
He is gonna be better
than all of us.

566
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,500
I'm not giving up my son.

567
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,800
- What about the money?
- You can keep it.

568
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,400
She protected her child,
like I never did mine.

569
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,100
What do you know
about the baby's father?

570
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,800
Could she be
with him now?

571
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,700
When she was a teenager,
I used to see him with her,

572
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,300
those times I'd drive around
all the places

573
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,000
where she used drugs.

574
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,600
If you could tell us
where those places were...

575
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,400
The 17th Street underpass
was the main one.

576
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,400
If you find Priscilla,

577
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,500
please tell her
she can come home.

578
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,100
No strings attached this time.

579
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
Happy hunting.

580
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,900
Home, sweet home.

581
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,300
- Hey, how you doing,
buddy? Seen this guy?
- Elvis ???

582
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,300
No?

583
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,900
- You seen this dude?
- no?

584
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,800
You seen this guy?

585
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,700
He's over there?

586
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
Thanks, man.

587
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,700
Rush.

588
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,200
All you gotta do is
answer my question.

589
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,300
And quit
denting my car.

590
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,500
- Ellis!
- Hey, Saccardo.

591
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,600
- I don't know where she is! 
- We need him conscious.

592
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,700
Hey, you missed a spot.

593
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,400
Talk about Priscilla.

594
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,700
I told him!

595
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,800
I don't know where she is.

596
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,000
I haven't seen
her in years.

597
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,900
She was gonna rat
you out, Ellis.

598
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,700
So you torched her
place, to shut her up.

599
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,200
- That's crazy.
- Where were you,

600
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,400
night of the fire?

601
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,900
I was with Priscilla.

602
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,700
The night
your kid burned up,

603
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,900
you two were hanging out
together?

604
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,500
I didn't know she left
the kid by itself.

605
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,800
Would you have really cared?

606
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
That what
you two lovebirds

607
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,000
were doing that
night, getting high?

608
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,100
I found her.

609
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,000
She was in a bad way,
you know, jonesin' hard.

610
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,800
I'm not the guy that's gonna
help you make the right choice.

611
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,600
Hey.

612
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
Hi.

613
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,500
Now, why
you wanna walk

614
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,800
when you can jump
into a warm car?

615
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,000
Come on, Pris,
it's freezing out there.

616
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,300
Are you high?

617
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,400
I love
this stuff.

618
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,900
The moment I tried it,

619
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,300
I knew nothing else
could compete.

620
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,300
Maybe my parents are right.

621
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,500
Maybe Max would be better off
with somebody else.

622
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,600
Somebody better than me.

623
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,300
It's just so hard to hold on.

624
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,200
Then let go.

625
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,800
HeHe

626
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,100
I can fix you up.

627
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,300
Right now.

628
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,700
Just like
old times.

629
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
Priscilla?

630
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,900
Priscilla was strong, you know?
She just walked away.

631
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,700
So... that's five minutes
you're alibied.

632
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,100
My sister had
me picked up

633
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,200
for jacking
her ride.

634
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
- Spent a night in jail.
- Yeah, we'll check that.

635
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,100
Any idea where Priscilla
might be hiding out?

636
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,000
The flower mart, maybe.

637
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Near the port.

638
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,100
Hey, she didn't hurt him.

639
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,900
She loved that kid.
Left it all behind for him.

640
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,600
Tough choice.

641
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,400
Toughest there is-
you just wouldn't know.

642
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,500
Done with this piece of crap?

643
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
Let's go.

644
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,800
That was Nick.

645
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,500
Coroner took a look
at the exhumed body.

646
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,300
Yeah?

647
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,200
Says something
ain't right.

648
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,200
Max Chapin was
eight months old.

649
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,400
He would've had teeth.

650
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,000
Teeth survive fire same as bone.

651
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,200
But there are none
on the jawbone.

652
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,900
Some kids get theirs late.

653
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,600
Yeah, but there's this...

654
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,500
The anterior fontanel.

655
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,000
Okay?

656
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,300
Soft spot, top of the head.

657
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,500
Closes up from the time
they're born till they're two.

658
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,300
This skull here,

659
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,900
the fontanel's 3 by 2
centimeters.

660
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That's too big for an
eight-month-old like Max.

661
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,600
Well, what's it
normal-sized for?

662
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,800
A four-month-old.

663
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,900
So this is not Max Chapin.

664
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,900
It was another kid
who died in that fire.

665
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,600
Well, if this kid ain't Max,
who is he?

666
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,400
And where's Priscilla's son?

667
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,300
You're not getting Ellis Smith.
We're not done with him.

668
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,000
Did I say anything?

669
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,100
The fire was just a diversion.
Whoever set it wanted Max.

670
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,400
And had access to an infant.
One who wouldn't be missed.

671
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,800
So who knew Priscilla would be
out of the apartment that night?

672
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,500
The ex, Ellis.
But he was in lockup, right?

673
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,600
Pretty elaborate plan,
kidnapping a baby.

674
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,000
Had to know Mom would be gone.

675
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,800
Think I might have
our Baby John Doe.

676
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,500
Dropped off at St. Paul's ER
February 11, '05.

677
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,400
Severe contusions
and internal bleeding.

678
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,600
There's your abuse.

679
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,200
Died the next day.

680
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,300
And this baby went missing
from the hospital?

681
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,900
Brought down to the morgue,

682
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,300
then vanished, day of
Priscilla's fire.

683
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,500
Who had access
to the morgue?

684
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,100
About 250 people.

685
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,500
All the employees.

686
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,400
County hospital, crap security.

687
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,600
Will, you and Kat
go to St. Paul's.

688
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,300
Find out who admitted Baby
John Doe, who was on shift

689
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,900
in NICU,
and the morgue.

690
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,900
Lil, track down Priscilla,
try the flower mart.

691
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,600
There's a crack den few doors
down from 252 Baker.

692
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,700
Desperate souls
if you're lookin'

693
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,000
at who might've taken a kid.

694
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,400
You two talk to
Priscilla together.

695
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,400
I thought about not
leaving him that night.

696
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,700
It was so cold.

697
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,200
I closed the
window really tight,

698
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,200
and I said, "I'll
be right back. "

699
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,000
I should have gone home.

700
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,000
He probably cried for me.

701
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,100
Why didn't I hear him?

702
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,600
Because you left.

703
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,400
Why?

704
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,600
You were right.

705
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,100
They shoulda put me away.

706
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,200
Why'd you leave him?

707
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
What does it matter?

708
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,400
Oh, it matters.

709
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,500
'Cause I gotta know...

710
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,900
why a mother would leave a child
all alone like that.

711
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,500
You wouldn't understand.

712
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,200
It's like when
you're a kid, right?

713
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,100
And you run out in front of
your parents into the street.

714
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,700
That's what it's like when
you first start using.

715
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,900
Free.

716
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,200
You're flying, man. You...

717
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,300
And you hear him
calling out for you,

718
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,600
but you don't care, do you?

719
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,200
No.

720
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,500
Next thing you know, you...

721
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,900
you don't know
how to get home no more.

722
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,300
You were finding your way home.

723
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,400
All by yourself.

724
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,600
'Cause you stayed
clean that night,

725
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,800
didn't you?

726
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
Yes.

727
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,200
I did.

728
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,100
For your son.

729
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,900
I know.

730
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,200
It's terrible.

731
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
I left him.

732
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,800
But I just thought...

733
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,000
if I could make it
through the night,

734
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,900
then Max and I would have
another day together.

735
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,300
Why here, Priscilla?

736
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,900
It was right after he was born,

737
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,400
when the heat first went out.

738
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
This was the first place
I felt hope.

739
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,700
It's okay, Max.

740
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,700
It's okay.

741
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,200
Hi.

742
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,400
Please.

743
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,400
* The itsy bitsy spider ran up
the water spout *

744
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,200
* Down came the rain... *

745
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,500
I can't do this.

746
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,400
*... life I've been waiting *

747
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,500
* Hot heels anticipating *

748
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,100
* Another love I found *

749
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:57,200
* Not to let it down *

750
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:08,600
* Ah... *

751
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,600
Here we are.

752
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,700
We're okay. Okay?

753
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,600
* Ah... *

754
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,900
I promise.

755
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,100
I'll always keep you warm, Max.

756
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,900
And happy and loved.

757
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,700
I promise I'll never
leave you, baby.

758
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,800
* Ah... *

759
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,200
I promise.

760
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,800
I promised him.

761
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,500
Why did I break
so many promises?

762
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,300
Priscilla?

763
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,400
we think your son might be alive.

764
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,300
Who knew that you came here
to the mart at night?

765
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,800
Ellis. Ellis knew.

766
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,600
- Who else?
- I don't know, I...

767
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,400
I told that rehab counselor.

768
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,300
The one at Maloney-Smith Center?

769
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,700
Lois Rabinski?

770
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,000
I told her it was the only way

771
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,200
I stayed clean.

772
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,600
She seemed like
she understood.

773
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,900
What about my son?

774
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,000
What about my baby?

775
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,100
We'll find him.

776
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,100
Where is he, Lois?

777
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Where's Max?

778
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,300
Who's Max?

779
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,400
You can't just
come in here.

780
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,800
Max Chapin is the child
you two kidnapped

781
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,900
in 2005.

782
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,100
I'm calling our lawyer.

783
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,600
You took that little baby's body

784
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,700
from St. Paul's Hospital

785
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,900
where you work, Doc.

786
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,500
Set that fire
to cover your tracks.

787
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,100
This is crazy.
Those are outrageous lies.

788
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,500
This is our son.

789
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,400
<i>Our son. His name is Isaac.</i>

790
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,900
His mother named him Max.

791
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,900
And she wants him back.

792
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Oh, yeah

793
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,200
Priscilla's alive.

794
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,400
You thought she O.D.'d.

795
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,100
She went so deep down
the rabbit hole

796
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,800
that she wouldn't care
about Max.

797
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,100
- But she does.
- She's clean.

798
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,800
Been clean
four and a half years.

799
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,700
She misses him so much.

800
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,200
Her little boy.

801
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,300
Who are you talking about?
My wife is Isaac's mother.

802
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,500
- Tom...
- Please, Lois.

803
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,900
We can do this here,
or we can let the DNA test

804
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,000
do the talking.

805
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,300
She was just like
so many others

806
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,300
I'd seen.

807
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,800
Who don't care.

808
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,900
Who can't do it.

809
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,900
Sweetheart,
why are you doing this?

810
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,800
The day I met that woman...

811
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,000
Priscilla.

812
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,600
I had just found out I had
to have another D & C.

813
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,400
Another miscarriage.

814
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,200
I wanted a baby so badly.

815
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,200
It wasn't fair.

816
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,600
We had so much to give.

817
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,100
So much love.

818
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,100
That woman couldn't
take care of him.

819
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,300
Just like that other one
abandoned at the hospital,

820
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,800
beaten to death, probably

821
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,200
by crackhead parents.

822
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
That would've been Max.

823
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,900
We were saving his life.

824
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,200
That's what you
tell yourself, huh?

825
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,600
But you knew the truth.

826
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,400
<i>You saw his room.</i>

827
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,300
<i>It was like walking into a room
filled with a rainbow,</i>

828
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,400
<i>wasn't it?</i>

829
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,100
No. That room was tiny.

830
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
It was dirty.

831
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,400
And then he came
home to us.

832
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,700
<i>Our baby.</i>

833
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,100
Let's see
what we have here.

834
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,700
He wasn't yours.

835
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,800
He never was.

836
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,300
You must've known that.

837
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,300
How did you live
with yourself?

838
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,100
I told myself to forget.

839
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,000
I had to.

840
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,800
Small, so prec...

841
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:16,000
* This time, this place *

842
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,500
* Misused mistakes *

843
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,200
* Too long, too late *

844
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,300
* Who was I to make you wait? *

845
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,200
* Just one chance,
just one breath *

846
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,500
* Just in case
there's just one left *

847
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,400
* 'Cause you know, you know *

848
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,200
* You know... *

849
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,700
* I love you *

850
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,300
* I loved you all along *

851
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,900
* And I miss you *

852
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,200
* Been far away
for far too long *

853
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,300
* I keep dreaming *

854
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,800
* You'll be with me
and you'll never go *

855
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,600
* Stop breathing *

856
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:11,900
* If I don't see you anymore *

857
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,500
* I love you *

858
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,900
* I loved you all along *

859
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,500
* And I miss you *

860
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,800
* Been far away
for far too long *

861
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,200
* I keep dreaming *

862
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,500
* You'll be with me
and you'll never go *

863
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,500
* Stop breathing *

864
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:42,600
* If I don't see you anymore *

865
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,100
* So far away *

866
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,200
* Far away for far too long *

867
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,400
* So far away *

868
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,600
* Far away for far too long *

869
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,600
* But you know, you know *

870
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,200
* You know... *

871
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,200
* I wanted *

872
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,300
* I wanted you to stay *

873
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,900
* 'Cause I needed *

874
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,500
* I need to hear you say *

875
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,700
* That I love you *

876
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,300
* I love you *

877
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,800
* I've loved you all along *

878
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,200
* I forgive you *

879
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,500
* For being away
for far too long *

880
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,900
* So keep breathing *

881
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,300
* 'Cause I'm not
leaving you anymore *

882
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,100
* Believe it *

883
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,500
* Hold on to me
and never let me go *

884
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,400
* Keep breathing *

885
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,700
* 'Cause I'm not
leaving you anymore *

886
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,500
* Keep breathing *

887
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:02,200
* Hold on to me
and never let me go *

888
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,700
* Keep breathing *

889
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:10,800
* Hold on to me
and never let me go. *
