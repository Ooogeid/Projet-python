Song:
("Magic Man" by Heart Playing)

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,530
* Cold late nights so long ago *

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,470
* When I was not so strong you know *

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,220
* A pretty man can to me *

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,390
* Never seen eyes so blue *

7
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,190
* You know I could not
run away,it seemed *

8
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,710
* We'd seen each other in a dream *

9
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,660
* It seemed like he knew me *

10
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,660
* He looked right through me *

11
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:32,560
* Yeah Come on home,girl,he
said with a smile *

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,660
* You don't have to love me
and let's get high awhile *

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,800
* But try to understand,try
to understand *

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,170
* Try,try,try to understand *

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,710
* Try to understand,try to understand *

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,850
* Try,try,try to understand *

17
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,690
* He's a magic man *

18
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,200
Got to say,Scotty,not a bad cook.

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,850
Even learning to pick up after himself.

20
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,500
Forget it. I ain't taking Vera.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,420
You want him out of your
place,man up and tell him.

22
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,840
How about just for a weekend?

23
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,700
Hey,Lil... Have mercy.

24
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,660
Colin Blake.

25
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,870
Embezzlement,fraud,assault.

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,190
Fresh out of the can.

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,470
- Here to tell us you're innocent?
- I wish I was.

28
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,150
I'm not making any excuses.

29
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,210
Stealing from dead and
disabled servicemen.Pretty cold.

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,610
And that got you 30 years in Allenwood?

31
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,840
Ten to 15.

32
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,570
Tried to break out a few months in,and a
CO got hurt and the judge doubled me up.

33
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,590
You sound like an angry guy,Colin.

34
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,660
You'd've been angry,too.

35
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,490
The reason I tried to break
out-- my daughter,Sarah.

36
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,100
Found stabbed to death in an abandoned
lot two months after I went in.

37
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,410
17 years old.

38
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,310
Sarah was everything to me.

39
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,760
Her mom died when she was 13.

40
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,600
Just the two of us.

41
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,950
Stood by me through the trial.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,530
Up to the night before I went in.

43
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,010
You'll finish out your last
fe weeks of school here.

44
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,550
Uh,then I've made arrangements for
you to stay with your Aunt Laura.

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,620
Dad,I'm not leaving.

46
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,940
We're gonna fight this.

47
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,290
You're innocent.

48
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,230
Sarah... I'm not.

49
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,890
I can't forget that look--
her knowing I was a criminal.

50
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,300
Any suspects in her murder.

51
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,570
Nothing.

52
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,630
The detective thought she was a runaway.

53
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,810
30 years-- no leads,and then yesterday
I get released and I find this.

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,540
The Jackals.

55
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,190
Outlaw motorcycle gang.

56
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,020
Know who the guy in this photo is?

57
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,860
I was hoping you could tell me.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,450
- Where'd you get this?
- Prison stored my checked belongings.

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,460
Somebody must have slipped it in
there,knowing I'd find it when I got released.

60
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,770
Jackals MC's hardcore--
drugs,guns,extortion.Sarah was a good girl.

61
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,770
An honor roll student.Good athlete.

62
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,070
The picture's from the Fourth of July.

63
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,080
A few months after I went in and
a few days before... she was killed.

64
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,800
You thinking she was tore up over
what you did,started acting out?

65
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,400
Sarah believed in me.I let her down.

66
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,890
She must have been desperate.

67
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:03,180
Detectives,I have to know--
what happened to my little girl?

Cold Case S6E16
<i>Jackals</i>

71
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,010
Sarah Blake--
17 years old.

72
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,940
Stabbed over 30 times.

73
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,740
Dumped in an shallow
grave near Hog Island Road.

74
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,070
Knife blade broke off in her
sternum.That's a lot of rage.

75
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,420
Defensive wounds on the arms and
hands.The girl put up a fight.

76
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,180
The Philadelphia Jackals are still
around today--meth trade,prostitution...

77
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,440
It's less about riding than
running a criminal enterprise.

78
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,230
Who was the leader of that pack in '76?

79
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,490
John Clark-- aka "Shameless."
And still at it today.

80
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,540
Rap sheet about ran
the printer out of ink.

81
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,150
What's a 17-year-old honor student
running around with these losers?

82
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,580
Betrayed by your dad,nowhere to
go... bad boys start looking good.

83
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,920
Said the girl who ran off
with a man on a motorcycle.

84
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,420
He was different.

85
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,640
Frank,are you able to get
anything off the photo?

86
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,380
Instamatic camera.

87
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,400
About as common as it gets.

88
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,390
See the one-percenter patch?That's
an outlaw badge of honor.

89
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,420
The one percent of the bikers
who cause 99% of all the trouble.

90
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,190
I got a buddy on the state police task force
watchdogging the Jackals.I'll see what he can run down.

91
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,590
We need to find out whop put
that photo in Colin's box.

92
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,090
Prison trustees with
access to the storage area?

93
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,020
Dad might have overstated
Sarah's good girl status.

94
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,280
School records have her
suspended for fighting.

95
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,680
Took a shot at some girl for
mouthing off about her dad.

96
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,740
Another girl jumped in and
wound up getting expelled.

97
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,290
Libby Traynor.

98
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,980
Partner in crime or a bad
influence on a good girl?

99
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,960
Might know about her
walk on the wild side.

100
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,980
I'll talk to her.

101
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,150
I'll hit the Jackals'
clubhouse,see what's what.

102
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,570
You're spitting in the
wind,Scotty.Bikers don't talk to cops.

103
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,140
Oh,that's 'cause nobody ever sent me.

104
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,630
Hey,don't worry.I'll be polite.

105
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,890
Yeah,just the same,take somebody along.

106
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,110
Watch your back.

107
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,370
Keep you from putting your foot in it.

108
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,010
You Shameless?

109
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,300
Couple questions about Sarah Blake,girl
you might have known back in '76.

110
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,340
Never heard of her.

111
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,490
All right,listen,jackass...

112
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,280
You want to talk to
me,you talk to the club.

113
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,720
I'd think real hard before you
make your next move,Shameless.

114
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,790
So much for polite.

115
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,090
Libby Traynor?

116
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,920
That's me.

117
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,380
You looking for highlights?

118
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,080
Looking for information.

119
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,410
You recognize anyone in this photo?

120
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,340
Freedom Run?

121
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,790
Can't say I remember that one.

122
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,000
Well,took a look into your record,Libby.

123
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,160
Uh,hung around with the Jackals
Motorcycle Club back in the '70s.

124
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,680
I wound up marrying one of those idiots.

125
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,580
Got killed on a bike in '81.

126
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,850
Best thing that ever happened to me.

127
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,730
Bygone days.

128
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,000
I bought this salon,left
all that behind.

129
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,260
Now I own three of them in Philly.

130
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,450
What about Sarah Blake?Remember her?

131
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,320
Her old man got in trouble,right?

132
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,580
About 30 years' worth of it.

133
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,290
Prissy brats at school turned on
her,treating her like she was dirt.

134
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,250
There was nothing left
for Sarah but the outcasts.

135
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,030
("Show Me the Way" by
Peter Frampton playing)

136
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,880
Ah,dirtbag kegger.

137
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,930
Warm beer.

138
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,260
I mean,there has got to be a better
party than this somewhere And with ice.

139
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,840
Just... just another
minute.I got to find Libby.

140
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,780
Uh,there she is.

141
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,480
Sarah!

142
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,920
- Can't believe you showed up.
- Libby,did they expel you?

143
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,940
Don't care.Got a place
to stay-- this is better.

144
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,680
Screw 'em,right?

145
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,080
Who do I phone?

146
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:51,560
Hardtail.'65 Panhead. Rigid.

147
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,590
I built the pipes myself.

148
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,080
It's beautiful.

149
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,850
Nothing like it in the world.

150
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,880
That's the midnight howl,citizens!

151
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,140
You are now officially on Jackal time!

152
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,680
So,if you ain't patched MC or property
of the MC,time to get lost is right now.

153
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,180
Except you,darling.

154
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,300
You can stay.

155
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,850
We're leaving,Sarah.

156
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,450
Now.

157
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,280
Hell of a party.

158
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,520
Don't think I saw her much after that.

159
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,890
Not really her crowd.

160
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,790
Guy she was talking to with the
bike... he the one in this photo?

161
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,290
People came and went.

162
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,970
But what about this boyfriend,the
one who pulled her away?

163
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,180
Possessive jerk from school.

164
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,970
Mark... something.

165
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,230
Guy was a tool.Smacking her around.

166
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,740
How do you know?

167
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,890
Two things I know,sweetheart: hair
and guys who like to hit women.

168
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,700
Only one of 'em I can fix.

169
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,140
Nice-looking bunch.

170
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,820
Like a group photo from
the Scumbag Glee Club.

171
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,270
Well,Shameless was
sergeant-at-arms of the Jackals.

172
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,020
Took over the club when the
president got killed on a bike.

173
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,670
New regime got a lot more violent.

174
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,830
No matches for the Philly Jackals
crossing with Colin Blake in the pen.

175
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,590
Hunt down hang-arounds,ex-affiliates,any
insiders with an ax to grind.

176
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,140
Club women,maybe.

177
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,540
Only considered useful
for sex and running drugs.

178
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,440
Nice names.Come in as a "Sweetbutt" and work
your way up to "Sheep" and graduate to "Old Lady.

179
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,980
" Sarah went in with a blind eye towards her
place in the pecking order.Could have got ugly.

180
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,450
What about this kid,Mark,who
brought her to the party?

181
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,510
Will's talking to him now.

182
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,960
Libby was right about one thing.

183
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,180
Mark Callahan picked up a sheet for assault
in college,slapping around an ex-girlfriend.

184
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,720
This going to take long?

185
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,000
Somewhere you got to be?

186
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,770
Deposition in a beep-beep case at 2:00.

187
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,060
Car accident.

188
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,680
Korean guy blows a stop sign,sideswipes
my client into a flower stand.

189
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,280
Everybody's suing everybody.Damn mess.

190
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,540
Civil litigation.Takes a special breed.

191
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,720
Balls of steel,my
fend.Nothing else will do.

192
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,720
You said this was about Sarah Blake.

193
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,830
You two have a thing back in '76?

194
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,620
Hooked up in high school.

195
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,590
Long time ago.

196
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,340
- What happened,she dump you?
- Please.

197
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,690
Right.You don't get dumped.

198
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,900
Girlfriend tried it in college.Campus
security d to pull you off of her.

199
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,360
Not the way I remember it.

200
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,810
ter Sarah's death.

201
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,180
Didn't bother to mention taking her to
parties with the local motorcycle gang.

202
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,940
Sarah was the one who
was into those dirtbags.

203
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,730
Not me.

204
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,340
- Hardtail '65 Panhead...
- A beauty and a love for bikes.

205
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,830
What are you doing here?

206
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,250
I saw the way you were looking
at my bike at the party.

207
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,980
I know that look.

208
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,800
Oh,you do,huh?

209
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:23,420
That's the look of somebody who wants to take off and
tell everyone to go to hell.Leave all this behind...

210
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,320
Thinyou can help me with that?

211
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,040
I know I can.

212
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,470
Bro,that's beautiful.

213
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,620
That is truly beautiful,Casanova.

214
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,200
- That is some really top-dollar BS
there.- Mark,I told you to leave me alone.

215
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,720
Oh,looks like you took a wrong turn,bro.

216
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,630
Never touch a guy's ride,bro.

217
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,160
Had to miss the rest
of the lacrosse season.

218
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,660
Jaw wired shut,lost two teeth.

219
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,110
Sarah turns up dead in '76.

220
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,580
You don't think to mention this guy?

221
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,240
Stayed out of it.She made her choice.

222
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,070
Remember a name,at least?

223
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,700
- Yeah.Darren.
- Darren what?

224
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,420
Darren who kicked my ass.

225
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,110
Tell you what,you find that guy,you
better bring along some backup.

226
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,580
No rap sheet on Darren.Whatever
he was up to,he never got caught.

227
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,350
Libby said people came and
went.Guy was just a hangaround?

228
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,090
Hangaround wouldn't be wearing
colors.Maybe got the name wrong.

229
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,260
Name's right.

230
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,790
Jackals' clubhouse was part of a
repair shop owned by Martin Malloy.

231
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,440
Founding president
of the Philly Jackals.

232
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,660
And Malloy was killed in
'74.Left the clubhouse to his son,

233
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,900
who then signed it over in trust
to the Jackals Motorcycle Club.

234
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,320
- Darren Malloy.
- Son of a Jackal.

235
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,470
So Sarah wasn't hopping on the
bike behind some hangaround kid.

236
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,660
She was... riding straight
into the Jackals' inner circle.

237
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,310
The kid didn't know what
she was getting into.

238
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,760
Quite an operation,Darren.

239
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,480
Turn around two custom
rides a week,50 grand a pop.

240
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,010
Yuppie choppers.

241
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,820
99 percenters.Everybody
wants a piece of the road.

242
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,650
QuQuite a step up from
the garage your dad owned.

243
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,870
Jackals.

244
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,070
Stole it out from under
me,made me sign it over to them.

245
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,840
That don't seem rht,you being
blood to one of the original ten.

246
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,080
That's me,but I wasn't one of them.

247
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,580
Not the way your patch tells it.

248
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,000
Son of the fnder of the Jackals MC.

249
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,640
That didn't mean nothing to them.

250
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,920
Dad got killed,just meant I had
to work harder to prove myself.

251
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,990
I wasn't allowed to wear the logo patch.

252
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,400
My dad's jacket,they tore it
off,said I had to earn my colors.

253
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,100
Even though you were a legacy?

254
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,410
Still just a prospect.Pretty
much meant I was their bitch.

255
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,470
Considered me "righteous" 'cause I
knew how to fix bikes,like my dad.

256
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,510
- So,why the break?
- I wasn't cut out for that life.

257
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,500
Way too rough for me.

258
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,420
I was never as hardcore as they
were and they never let me forget it.

259
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,660
That's not how Mark Callahan tells it.

260
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,600
Remember him?Worked him over with
a chain behind Blessed Trinity?

261
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,450
Yeah,I went after that kid.

262
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,480
He was bigger than me.I didn't want
to get my ass kicked in front of Sarah.

263
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,070
Well,gotta wonder-- what's a nice girl like
Sarah doing with a biker thug like you,Darren?

264
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,810
My dad got killed on a bike.

265
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,830
Her dad was gone.

266
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,890
We just kind of found each other.

267
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,720
Man,she loved to ride.

268
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,130
Thought it was about me,but she was...
looking for more than a boyfriend.

269
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,570
So you brought her to the Jackals.

270
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,310
Jackals came with a dark side and
she was wearing blinders to it.

271
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,910
I can't believe you made me ride
this garbage wagon,man.What gives?

272
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,750
That's what gives,junior.

273
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,710
You had me running that
crap without telling me?

274
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,640
What the hell,man?

275
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:08,240
Don't you ever question us in
front of some sweetbutt,understand?

276
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,770
Ever.

277
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,600
- I got it.
- Good.

278
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,780
You gotta earn your keep,prospect.

279
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,210
Want you to run this package up to
Pittsburgh,represent the Jackals.

280
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,170
Got a problem with that?

281
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,400
- No.
- Get your ass on the road.

282
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,520
I'm going to get you
home,get you out of this.

283
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,260
Home?What home would that be?

284
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,990
I think I'm gonna stay.

285
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,640
You don't get it,Sarah.

286
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,280
These guys are running felony weight.

287
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,210
Everybody's a criminal.

288
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,710
At least the Jackals
are up-front abo it.

289
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,470
Sarah!

290
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,390
Nobody cares what my
father did here,Darren.

291
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,650
At least I know where I stand.

292
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,580
You just left her there?

293
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,260
That whole scene was
just too much for me.

294
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,960
I never made that run to Pittsburgh.

295
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,310
But Sarah wanted to stay?

296
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,710
This guy with the knife...?

297
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,120
Monster.

298
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,460
Shameless's chief
enforcer.Sadistic son of a bitch.

299
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,000
He loved to get his hands dirty.

300
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,420
I'm tellin' ya,the guy
has a place for everything.

301
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,150
Except you.

302
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,480
Situation's about to get
critical at Casa Jeffries.

303
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,150
If I could just... think
of somewhere else to stay...

304
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,780
Dude,been working together what,forever?

305
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,000
Just ask,man.

306
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,540
So,can I crash at your place for awhile?

307
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,290
- No.
- No. No.

308
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,980
Scotty,what's the
story on this "Monster"?

309
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,220
Chief enforcer of the Jackals,but
we got no jacket on him at all--

310
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,600
no name,no arrests,no prison,nothin'.

311
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,020
Don't make sense.

312
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,500
I had my guy at the state police
run the name,see if we get a hit.

313
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,190
Got something with Colin.

314
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,670
Storage room trustee at FCI
Allenwood was a former Jackal.

315
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,880
- Pittsburgh chapter.
- You recognize the guy?

316
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,210
Burke... never said anything
to me about being a biker.

317
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,220
Got popped in '88 for kidnapping
and murdering a drug dealer.

318
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,530
Met him on his first day in.

319
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,360
Knew the guy 20 years.

320
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,850
And he knew this was killing me
- why didn't he just tell me?

321
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,130
Probably scared.

322
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,020
's helping u now.

323
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,370
He could know more.If he
knows who killed Sarah...

324
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,200
Well,Burke's been in
Allenwood a long time.

325
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,320
Bet he'd love having some visitors.

326
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,530
Oh,man... What the hell is this?

327
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,700
No doc todayBurke; Just us cops.

328
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,160
Here about a photo you
dropped on Colin Blake.

329
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,420
His dead daughter with
your motorcycle crew.

330
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,020
I don't know anything about that photo.

331
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,000
And I don't appreciate you
ambushing my clinic time.

332
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,950
Well,how about I pretend I'm your
proctologist,and shove my foot up your ass?

333
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,100
Come on,Burke-- Jackals sold
you out,let you rot in here.

334
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,640
Sold you out for killing a drug dealer.

335
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,890
- That's cold.
- Yeah.

336
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,210
Some tweaker I kept in my storage
shed till he gave up his stash.

337
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,780
You know,I,I pass out,I forgot about
him a couple of days,he winds up dead.

338
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,380
Heatstroke.

339
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,790
The bastards sold me out when the feds started
sniffing around,protect their precious drug trade.

340
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,760
This is two weeks after the
photo you dropped on Colin.

341
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,950
Want to have a look closer?

342
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:34,080
Guy got you out of the hole.Jackals
didn't help you out; Colin did.

343
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,270
You know something,give
the man some peace.

344
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,230
I took that shot the Bicentennial Run.

345
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,620
You know,pretty girl on a
bike,somethin' to remember.

346
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,220
You see her after that?

347
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,290
Yeah,just one time.

348
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,970
I was in Philly as a connection
for the Pittsburgh boys.

349
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,660
- Where?
- Clubhouse.

350
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,200
She tried to act tough,but it was
obvious the kid didn't belong there.

351
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,780
("Stranglehold" by Ted Nugent playing)

352
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,130
She's jailbait,man,look at her.

353
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,510
She's just like all the other sheep,expecting
a free ride,offering nothing up.

354
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,140
What is it you're doing here,princess?

355
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,550
What is it you want me to do?

356
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,270
We're gettin' jacked by the fuzz every
time we roll colors outside the gate.

357
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,930
Need somebody won't attract attention.

358
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,270
I'll do it.

359
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,060
Carry the package for you.

360
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,840
Wherever you need it to go.

361
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,310
Listen to the prom queen.

362
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,860
But you gotta be straight with me.

363
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:45,240
If I'm carrying,I gotta know what it
is,what to expect when I get there.

364
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,880
No surprises.

365
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,280
You got a deal.

366
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,100
It's about time you started
pullin' your weight around here.

367
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,730
Girl had guts,and
Monster didn't like that.

368
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,920
Time she turned up
dead,Monster'd lit out.

369
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,140
Left the club?

370
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,450
Nobody ever heard from him again.

371
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,700
See,MC's real particular about who you
can and can't kill-- believe me,I'd know.

372
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,850
She was useful-- Shameless
wanted that girl alive.

373
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,370
You sayi Monster killed her?

374
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,720
Explain why he disappeared.

375
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,630
Maybe he hauled ass and maybe
Shameless killed him as an example.

376
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,990
Either way--
good riddance.

377
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,170
Excuse me.

378
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,770
Looking for Will.

379
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,480
- Will Jeffries?
- He here?

380
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,590
-  Will?
- Who knows?

381
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,310
Staties found our Monster.

382
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,050
They got a sheet under an alias?

383
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:05,090
Better.Monster's real
name was James Drew.

384
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,040
Chief enforcer for the
Jackals Motorcycle Club.

385
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,130
Monster... was a cop.

386
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,050
There he goes.

387
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,780
James Drew,Philly PD.

388
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,470
Easy.

389
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,570
You dropped pretty far
off the grid... Monster.

390
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,600
I haven't heard the name
Monster in a long time.

391
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,130
Be about '76,I guess.

392
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,650
Undercover inside the most violent motorcycle club in
Philly,then all of a sudden you drop off the face of the earth?

393
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,660
Blacked out your tats.Not
a Jackal,not a cop.

394
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,550
So what are you,Monster?

395
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,910
I didn't want their mark on me anymore.

396
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,320
What happened?What drove you out?

397
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:03,930
Shameless invited me to prospect into
the Jackals after we served in 'Nam.

398
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,510
Didn't know I'd hit the academy
in the meantime,got my badge.

399
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,740
First ever investigation of
an outlaw club anybody tried.

400
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,780
Well,easy to get lost
playing both sides.

401
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,250
You ever done undercover,Detective?

402
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:22,040
Um,somebody I know... he's
in right now.It's tough.

403
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,290
I were you,I wouldn't bet my
pension on ever seeing h again.

404
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,590
Seductive world--
power,freedom.

405
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,010
Mostly it was the drugs.

406
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,210
I got hooked and lost myself in it.

407
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,190
What about Sarah Blake?

408
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,150
Sarah was the reason I left.

409
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,420
- She didn't belong there.
- You knew her.

410
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,900
Girl was jacking up my investigation.

411
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,730
Most of those MC guys were idiots.

412
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,250
She was smart.

413
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,930
And smart was a liability for me inside.

414
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,320
Hello?

415
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,450
I told you you don't belong here.

416
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,280
Think this is a game,little girl?

417
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,710
I-I got the money in my car.

418
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,670
D-Did everything just like you
told me.Shameless said I'd be safe.

419
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,690
Shameless?

420
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,560
Girl,who do you think
put us together alone?

421
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,660
There's only way you got
any value around here.

422
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,100
No! I'm not one of your sheep!

423
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,390
You're nothing but an animal.

424
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,000
Sarah,get the hell out of here.

425
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,150
Now. Go!

426
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,370
She was right,I was an anil.

427
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,870
I got my gear,hopped on my bike and
blew the hell out of there that night.

428
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,130
You didn't know Sarah had been killed?

429
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,870
All I could think about was
getting clean and never look back.

430
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:15,510
If I had stayed,did my
job,she might've had a chance.

431
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,750
I messed up.

432
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,430
When she left that night,know
where she was headed?

433
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:27,650
She was riding the sofa of some girl who
was angling to be Shameless's old lady.

434
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,740
Libby something.

435
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,530
Libby Traynor.

436
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,070
Real operator,that one.

437
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,040
Cold as ice.

438
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,860
Well,how do we know you didn't
do her in yourself,Monster?

439
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,360
You don't.

440
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,260
Guess you're gonna be taking me in.

441
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,140
Looked hard at Libby
Traynor's financials.

442
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,930
Hinky all the way down.

443
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,970
The deposit slips don't jibe with her account
activity,and tax records don't jibe with her address.

444
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,600
Well,the DEA shakedown on one
of her shops six years ago--

445
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,190
popped the manager for
possession with intent.

446
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:09,890
Down payment on her salon comes from the
same trust that owns the Jackals repair shop.

447
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,910
Starting to sound like a front
for the club's meth trade.

448
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,870
Burke got shanked in his cell.

449
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,130
CO fou him dead this morning.

450
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,220
Jackals are closing ranks.

451
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,950
All we got against them now is Libby.

452
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,360
There she goes.

453
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,400
Need a reason to pull her over.

454
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,190
Well,now we got one.

455
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,050
She have that bag when she went in?

456
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,510
Nope.

457
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,240
Let her get a few
blocks,then light her up.

458
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,620
You lied to us,Libby.

459
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,680
Jackals are still using
you,after all these years.

460
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,900
Nobody uses me.

461
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,440
A pound of meth in that diaper bag.

462
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,840
Only hair you're gonna be
doing is your cellmate's.

463
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,560
Bring it.I got my people.

464
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,050
Well,Jackals already killed
Burke to protect their secret.

465
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,300
Think they won't do the same
to a used-up sheep like you?

466
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,650
I'll take my chances.

467
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,920
Don't kid yourself.

468
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,260
A woman in that club--
you're property,nothing more.

469
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:50,610
Property that can be
bought orold or eliminated.

470
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,060
Just like that.

471
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,750
You got to set me up outside
of Philly,away from them.

472
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,970
- First,tell me what happened to Sarah
- I don't know.

473
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,240
Oh,come on,Libby.She was
sleeping on your sofa.

474
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,730
You knew everything
going on at that club.

475
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,290
Tried to jump the line.

476
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,750
Figured running drugs for
Shameless'd get her in cheap.

477
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,450
Compared to what?

478
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,500
The way you and the other
sheep had to pay your dues?

479
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,860
Stupid girl didn't get it.

480
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,960
We were part of something.

481
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,170
We were family.

482
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,010
Only hurts the first time.

483
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:31,350
After that... they respect you.

484
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,380
Darren was right.

485
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,800
I don't belong here.

486
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,290
Destiny Where you gonna go,sweetie?

487
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,360
Your daddy's mansion?

488
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,120
Jackals are all you've got left now.

489
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:47,260
I gotta get out of this,Libby.

490
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,740
You still got Shameless' money.

491
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,300
Pull yourself together.Take it back.

492
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:56,270
- He'll talk sense into you.
- Shameless set me up once.

493
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,910
I'm not going back there.

494
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,340
I'll leave the
monehere.You take it to him.

495
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,230
Oh,honey.

496
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,830
Not my mess.

497
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,500
You made it you clean it up.

498
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,630
When she
left--

499
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:21,140
the look on her face... I figured
she might do something stupid.

500
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,630
Talk to the cops maybe.

501
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,460
- And you called Shameless.
- Only thing I could do.

502
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,120
She was going off the reservation.

503
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,430
With his money.

504
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,100
You're gonna do the right
thing now,Libby.For Sarah.

505
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,500
You're gonna give me
the Jackals,understand?

506
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,320
Or I'm gonna give you to them.

507
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,060
The ckals hold their chapter
meetings at the clubhouse.

508
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,870
Church,they call it.

509
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,450
They kept minutes of
every move they ever made.

510
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,690
Five minutes to sunup.

511
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,760
Ready to roll on these fools?

512
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,070
Right behind you.

513
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,770
let's do this

514
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,270
Drop your weapons! Get down!

515
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,390
Drop your weapons! Now!

516
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,640
Down on the ground!

517
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,860
Detective!

518
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,440
30 years of church meetings.

519
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:56,280
Every detail accounted for.Every
move the Jackals ever made.

520
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,980
A good read.

521
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,990
Know what I liked most?

522
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,410
There were surprises.

523
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,880
Digging through expecting to nail
Shameless down for Sarah's murder.

524
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,370
But what I found was you.

525
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,800
I told you,I quit the Jackals.

526
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,690
But not when you said you did.

527
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,670
Minutes show you came back from that
Pittsburgh run,the very night Sarah was killed.

528
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,870
Also shows you brought in the
take from Sarah's run to New York.

529
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,650
Now,howd you wind up
with her money,Darren?

530
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,030
You must have the dates wrong.

531
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,190
You said yourself you were a prospect.

532
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,940
Pretty much their bitch.

533
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,370
They told you something
needed to be done,you did it.

534
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,820
No questions asked.

535
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,200
No,I could never hurt Sarah.

536
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,690
So maybe you tried to help
her.Last time anyone saw her,

537
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,740
she... was talking about you.

538
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:53,440
Darren,you were the last
person she trusted in the world.

539
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,930
Don't let her down again.

540
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,860
She called me and said
she was in trouble.

541
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,020
I don't... I don't
know what to do,Darren.

542
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,330
I should have listened to you.

543
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,850
All right,I'm here.

544
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,060
I'll help you.

545
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,930
I still got Shameless'
money from the run.

546
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,640
I-I-I don't want to...
I can't see him again.

547
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:38,450
Wh-What am I gonna do?

548
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,950
Sarah,let's run.

549
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,960
You and me.We don't need anybody else.

550
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,870
Darren... w-we can't.

551
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,040
There's nothing left
for you here.Me either.

552
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,910
Let's just take this money
and go and never look back.

553
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,490
- But my father...
- ...Is gone.

554
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,820
He let you down.

555
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,310
I won't.I'll take care of you.

556
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,620
I'll be your family now.

557
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,560
You gotta trust me.

558
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,500
She wouldn't go with me,so
I just... I just rode away.

559
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,500
And took the money and
just... left her there alone?

560
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,200
Nowhere to go?

561
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,300
I can't believe you would do that.

562
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,550
I mean,you cared about her,right?

563
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,260
Yes,I cared about her.

564
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:54,260
So,she climbed up behind you
on that bike and you rode away.

565
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,550
And then what happened?

566
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,190
Did you realize how
much trouble you were in?

567
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:05,360
The only way to save yourself from
the Jackals,to redeem yourself--

568
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,650
- take care of the problem for them.
-  No.

569
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,400
I would never ever hurt her.

570
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,760
Then who did?

571
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,850
You don't gotta talk,Shameless.

572
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,060
We'll lay it out for you.

573
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:30,070
Got testimony from ex-affiliates-- about 30 years
of methamphetamine trade across three states.

574
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,390
That makes it federal time.

575
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:38,070
Got your club minutes,outlining every stupid,illegal-ass
activity you and your buddies ever engaged in.

576
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,060
Real smooth,Jack.We
love stuff in writing.

577
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,240
And we got your old prospect,Darren Malloy,in the
next room giving you up for Sarah Blake's murder.

578
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:50,330
Only ride you're gonna be
taking now... is upstate.

579
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,200
Punk will never sing.

580
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,150
- No?
- Prospect or not.

581
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,070
No Jackal talks to cs.

582
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,330
Oh,yeah.

583
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,530
You know everything
about the Jacks,right?

584
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,350
Everything worth knowing.

585
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,170
Recognize him?

586
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,610
That's your
boy-- Monster.

587
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,100
Your sergeant at arms.

588
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,030
- You know he was state police?
- You brought him into the club.

589
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,090
Vouched for a cop,across the board.

590
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:34,920
Man,rest of the MC finds out about that,it's gonna
be a cold winter watching your back in gen-pop.

591
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:40,800
See,you know everything about
the Jackals and now,so do we.

592
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,720
Want to take bets on your
boy Darren keeping his lid on?

593
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,980
You walked away from the
job before,and a girl died.

594
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,750
Time for you to make it right.

595
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,880
What do you want?

596
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,700
Tell me everything
Shameless knows about Darren.

597
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,620
Shameless sold you out,Darren.

598
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,790
Shameless?

599
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,880
No way,never.

600
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:24,270
Your first bike was a Sportster 883,'cause
you were too scrawny to handle an FLH.

601
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,860
A bitch bike.

602
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,980
That was no bitch bike.

603
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:33,560
- It was beautiful.
- And when your father got killed,you ran to Shameless.

604
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,150
You cried on his shoulder.

605
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:42,510
Remember what he told
you,Darren?********

606
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,080
He said,"Look around.

607
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,110
Every Jackal in this
room is your father now.

608
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,170
" Said they were gonna
raise you to have class.

609
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,220
You never cried again,did you?

610
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,710
Until the night you killed Sarah.

611
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,270
We were gonna run away together.

612
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,260
Just the two of us.

613
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,190
She trusted me.

614
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,350
But I let her down.

615
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,030
Because I was a coward.

616
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,130
Ofthe bike,prospect.

617
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,490
Your back warmer,too.

618
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,450
Let's go.

619
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,530
Thought you and your sheep could
just light out with my money?

620
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:57,040
- Shameless,wait.
- Your old man'd be ashamed.

621
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,590
He'd knock you on your
ass,if he were alive.

622
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,050
Shameless,we were gonna
bring you the money.

623
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,130
- I was on my way to see you.
- Is that right?

624
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,880
Last I checked,West Chester
Pike leads away from my door.

625
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,090
- No,I was gonna come...
- Hey,hey,hey,it's all right.

626
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:22,210
You're not the first brother
led astray by a woman.

627
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,470
Won't happen again,though.

628
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,500
Go get my shovel,prospect.

629
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,880
- Darren...
- Now!

630
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,950
Darren?Darren,Darren?

631
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,160
Darren!Don't let them do this Darren!

632
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,960
Darren!Darren!

633
