No signs, sorry.

<i>You've got to hide, Pete.</i>

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,490
<i>They'll find you, and you'll burn.</i>

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,930
<i>Don't let them have the map.</i>

7
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,830
Exley ?

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,190
What are you doing here ?

9
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,190
Do you have the map ?

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,360
You trust me.

11
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,260
Right, Pete ?

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,440
You're safe now, Pete.

13
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,060
I want you to hear something.

14
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,500
I don't understand.

15
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,530
Close your eyes

16
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,660
Remember what I told you.

17
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,020
Focus on one instrument.

18
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:47,421
<i>"Beautiful Boy"
by John Lennon.</i>

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,010
Do you still hear Exley's voice ?

20
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,830
He's gone.

21
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,680
Good.

22
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,470
You're doing good, Pete.

23
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,070
The Inner Plane hierarchy
must be in flux

24
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,871
I think... I think that's why he left.

25
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,640
Well, maybe he's not a
John Lennon fan like us.

26
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,340
Can you play the wheels song ?

27
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,750
Sure. That's your favorite.

28
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,980
Dr. Ramierez, I don't understand
why they want me to burn.

29
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,460
I didn't do anything.

30
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,890
I know you didn't,Pete.I know.

31
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:04,191
.............

32
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,880
Sea-Monkeys ?

33
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,940
- Yeah.
- Nice to see you went all out.

34
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,870
They're educational and entertaining.

35
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,100
Any word on Will ?

36
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,030
Out of the hospital tomorrow.

37
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,140
How about we sign our names
to one and keep the other ?

38
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,600
What he doesn't know...

39
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,501
can't hurt him.

40
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,860
Help you ?

41
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,820
I'm looking for the detectives
that work on old cases.

42
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,910
You got one. I'm Detective Rush.

43
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,540
Steve Wiegan. It's about my
college roommate, Pete Scanell.

44
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,770
Brilliant guy with big dreams.

45
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,640
<i>"Imagine"
by John Lennon.</i>

46
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,260
This is class.

47
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,720
- It's really good.
- Thanks,man.

48
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,320
Pete was gonna be
a mechanical engineer,

49
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:09,521
until he started saying
the TV was talking to him.

50
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,600
He was murdered ?

51
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,600
No. I mean,
I don't know for sure,

52
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:15,401
but I think he may have
killed someone.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,970
Disappeared at the end
of our freshman year.

54
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,090
Thought he went back to
Oregon until yesterday.

55
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,630
I volunteer at a shelter downtown.

56
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,030
There was this homeless guy
sitting out front,

57
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:28,631
scribbling into a notebook,
mumbling.

58
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,910
Pete ?

59
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,090
Couldn't believe it.

60
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,670
I said his name,and he
started freaking out.

61
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,610
He took off, but he dropped this.

62
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,920
Check out the page I marked.

63
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,060
"Dr. Ramierez had to burn.

64
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:46,161
It started with the curtains,
they litp like paper."

65
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,940
I Googled the name.

66
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,670
There was a Dr.Julie Ramierez,

67
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:52,171
therapist specializing
in schizophrenia.

68
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,580
Killed five years ago
when her house burned down.

69
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,190
Yeah, part of a string of arsons.
A man was convicted.

70
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,270
I saw that. But Pete's
description, I mean...

71
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,920
-  You think he did it.
- I don't know.

72
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,040
But if he did,he's still
out there,Detective.

73
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,410

Transcript >VO :www.ydy.com

75
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,760
Mind games

76
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,060
Richard Kiesel.

77
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,190
Consecutive lifes for
starting two fatal fires.

78
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,920
Remind me not to invite
you to a barbecue.

79
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,650
The houses were supposed
to be empty.

80
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,540
Prosecuted on five counts
of arson,

81
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,841
convicted on two.

82
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,280
It was never my intention to harm.

83
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,330
Part of your plea was they
dropped the Ramierez charge.

84
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,260
'Cause that wasn't mine.

85
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,320
I picked buildings i could watch burn.

86
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,360
That house had no vantage point.

87
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,170
How is the vantage point in here ?

88
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,210
Is that, uh...

89
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,400
May i ?

90
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,690
Gas was my accelerant.

91
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,520
If it was me,

92
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:29,221
you'd see a black char
across the floor like a skid mark.

93
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,940
Maybe you felt like switching it up.

94
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,230
No.

95
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,860
This is amateur hour.

96
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,630
See the charring
around the windows ?

97
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,120
Point of origin ?

98
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,050
Ten to one, this thing
started with the curtains.

99
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,730
And prior to discharging your weapon
three times at a 12-year-old boy

100
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,800
,is it true you were required to
attend counseling

101
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,101
for another shooting ?

102
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,480
I don't see how that's relevant.

103
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,970
- Yes or no, detective.
- Yes.

104
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,520
And did you fulfill your obligation
as required by the discipline code ?

105
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,150
Yes,i did.

106
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,980
You went to every session ?

107
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,550
The doctor signed the release.

108
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,150
I'll take that as a no.

109
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,550
And when you shot little Gabriel Ariza,
did you say,

110
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:11,551
"I don't need an excuse
to take you down ?"

111
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,620
He was shooting at us.

112
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,790
-  He had just shot another cop !
- Is that what you said

113
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,591
before you shot and killed
George Marks ?

114
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,170
How about an objection,counselor?

115
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,770
That scumbag was way out of line.

116
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:23,771
Sorry, excuse me a minute.

117
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,600
Well, that was a hell of a show
you put on back there, Rosie.

118
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,870
Funny how you brought up the,
uh, discipline code.

119
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,890
Funny ?

120
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,800
Well, you get pinched
on a DUI last year,

121
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:34,701
call me to make it go away,

122
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,401
and this is how you treat
one of my detectives ?

123
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,190
Well, that was personal.
I'm providing a defense for my client.

124
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,150
The kid shot a cop.

125
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,050
Don't get much more
personal than that to me.

126
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,150
Relax, Curtis. Let the judge kick
this back down, try Ariza as a juvie,

127
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:49,450
and I'll give up appellate rights.
Let me think.

128
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,440
- No.
- Get real.

129
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,910
I got a kid with a low IQ
and no priors.

130
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,680
You've got a shady statement
coerced by a quick-shot cop.

131
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,560
She's been a cop for over 15 years.

132
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:01,361
Of course she's been involved
in a shooting.

133
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,290
- Hell of a shot,too.
- She's also got a temper on the stand.

134
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,780
And after I subpna
her internal affairs files,

135
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:09,081
we both know that
that confession's getting thrown out.

136
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,930
Okay, you want to roll the dice,
let's go.

137
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,330
First degree felony murder,that's...
wow, that's-

138
00:08:14,531 --> 00:08:16,231
that's mandatory life.

139
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,480
- See you in court.
- Come on, Curtis.

140
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,720
Kid will die in prison.

141
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,430
Okay, so he pleads to third degree.

142
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,660
25 to 50 for shooting Jeffries.

143
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,600
Still gonna give him a chance to get
out before they carry him out in a box.

144
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,630
That,and you apologize
to the good detective.

145
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,820
Like you mean it.

146
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,230
Apologies, detective.

147
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,540
Nice doing business with you,rosie.

148
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,330
Thank me later. Buy me lunch.

149
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,250
Hey, how was court ?

150
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,530
Laugh a minute.

151
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,120
Any luck finding Pete Scanell ?

152
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,140
Got uniforms checking the shelters

153
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:02,341
and a stakeout at the soup kitchen
where the roommate works.

154
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,820
Dr.Julie Ramierez.
Phd from Temple.

155
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,350
Grew up poor in El Centro.

156
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,650
Both parents now deceased.
No siblings.

157
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,390
Well, she worked
the Tranquility house,

158
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:12,491
a board and care for
the mentally ill.

159
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,860
You try and get a copy of her
patient records on Pete Scanell ?

160
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,970
Was an uphill battle, boss.
Patient confidentially laws are a bitch.

161
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,210
Case closed.

162
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,360
The Traydens did it.

163
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,220
"The Traydens poisoned the air,
made electric wind.

164
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,390
I took a flame-ship that
blasted me into the inner plane."

165
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,350
Here's a map if anybody
cares to visit.

166
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,370
Check it out,

167
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:31,471
see if any of the details
match the crime scene.

168
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,330
Boss,
this guy's cuckoo pants.

169
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,950
Agents from the inner
plane want to kill him.

170
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,270
I'll do it.

171
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,350
Screen grab from Pete's myspace page,
hasn't been updated

172
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:41,051
since he dropped out of college.

173
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,880
Lot of friends and hobbies.

174
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,610
And bong relay was his favorite sport.

175
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,850
Family ?

176
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,990
His father in Oregon.
Wasn't too chatty.

177
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,150
Got the feeling they
hadn't spoken in years.

178
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,810
Check credit cards, phone records.

179
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,210
See if Dr. Ramierez had problems
with anyone, Pete or otherwise.

180
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,240
Everyone here at
tranquility felt her loss.

181
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,400
Julie went the extra mile
for her patients.

182
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,740
She having trouble
with any of them ?

183
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,320
Kind of goes with the territory,
but nothing out of the ordinary.

184
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,730
Remember a patient of hers,
Pete Scanell ?

185
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,710
You know I can't discuss that.

186
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,550
A patient's confidentiality
is sacrosanct.

187
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,140
If you could just tell us if he was
staying here the night Julie died.

188
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,040
I'm sorry. Unless you
have a court order...

189
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,780
Do you have a lockdown time
here for patients like Pete ?

190
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,650
Each patient is treated
individually.

191
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,100
Some are on lockdown,some
are free to come and go.

192
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,690
The kid's a murder suspect.

193
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,600
We know he was here,
we clear him of being a suspect.

194
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,090
Again, unless you have
a court order...

195
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,780
Your employee was murdered.

196
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,270
We're asking for your help.

197
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,930
Is there anything
you can tell us about

198
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:48,231
when he wasn't legally
a patient here yet ?

199
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,640
Were you at his intake ?

200
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,080
Look, I'm breaking the rules.

201
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,260
I can tell you this much...

202
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,440
<i>"Mind games"
by John Lennon.</i>

203
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,020
What day is it, Pete ?

204
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,290
If iI said it was monday,

205
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,091
you'd tell Exley I said
it's tuesday.

206
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,870
I know the FBI has
this room wired.

207
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,890
I'm not a fool.

208
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,400
Think about hurting yourself, Pete ?

209
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,600
I hurt, and I think,
and I watch, and I think.

210
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,310
I'm just watching
the wheels go round.

211
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,050
I love to watch them roll...

212
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,440
Pete.

213
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,240
Who's your favorite Beatle ?

214
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,710
My favorite Beatle is John.

215
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,770
They'd talk and she'd have Pete
listen to John Lennon music.

216
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,040
Julie thought music was
a genuine therapy.

217
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:42,941
It's not ?

218
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,500
Music works well
with brain trauma,

219
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:48,101
but studies are inconclusives
with schizophrenia.

220
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,450
Honestly, I thought
it was a waste of time.

221
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,030
Was she like that
with all her patients ?

222
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,040
She had a unique perspective.

223
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,700
Her mom was an
undiagnosed schizophrenic.

224
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,190
Suicide when Julie was 16.

225
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,330
I think when she was
with a patient,

226
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:03,431
she was trying
to understand her mother.

227
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,060
You notice anything
going on the day she died ?

228
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,210
Just that she didn't show up
for work.

229
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,940
I left a few messages for her,
but I never heard back.

230
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,730
Who was this caseworker,
the guy with tats ?

231
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,660
Juan salazar. Good guy.

232
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,840
He left a couple of years ago
to work with recovering addicts.

233
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,280
Well, thanks for all the
info on Pete Scanell.

234
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,550
Big help.

235
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,360
You know,
contrary to popular myth,

236
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:29,361
most paranoid schizophrenics
are timid.

237
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,320
Pete fit that profile.

238
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,990
He was a good kid
who was severely ill.

239
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,710
An illness that makes you violent.

240
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,540
I'd rather be trapped with
a paranoid schizophrenic

241
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:39,641
than a bipolar

242
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,842
or a borderline personality disorder.

243
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,740
You never met the homeless guy
that attacked me with a hacksaw.

244
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,130
Said Mr Spock made him do it.

245
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,680
Most voices are harmless,
especially at the onset.

246
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,890
It's usually a friend
or a family member.

247
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,190
I struck out with the judge.

248
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,330
No access to Julie's patient
records on Pete Scanell.

249
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,380
I'll talk to Bell.
Maybe he can call in a favor.

250
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,640
Got a possible sighting
of Pete at Kemble Park.

251
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,210
Took off when he saw the uniform.

252
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,390
Police can't look too friendly
to a paranoid kid.

253
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,400
I'll swing by with Valens.
Maybe he'll come back around.

254
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,040
Vanessa Quarterman came forward
at the fire scene.

255
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,580
Said she had dinner with
the victim the night before.

256
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,560
See what she knows.

257
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,800
Julie and I were Kappa sisters,
real close.

258
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,580
I named my daughter after her.

259
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,530
Still can't believe it.

260
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,850
Was she acting different in any way,
upset with anyone ?

261
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,490
No, we had a great time.

262
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,020
She seemed busy, but happy.

263
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,770
You two worked together ?

264
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,120
God, no.

265
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,190
I got into investment banking
for the money,

266
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:43,891
and she was always a do-Gooder.

267
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,790
We were quite a pair.

268
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,130
Was there a boyfriend
in the picture ?

269
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,560
I tried to set her up,
but she was devoted to work.

270
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,500
She was always writing about
patients in her journal.

271
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,690
She keep this journal
at home or at work ?

272
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,960
You got me.

273
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,190
Did she ever talk about a patient
named Pete Scanell ?

274
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,270
I only visited there a few times.

275
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,180
One too many former thugs working
at Tranquility, if you ask me.

276
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,050
She ever mention a caseworker,
Juan Salazar ?

277
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,770
The scary guy with tats ?
He gave me the creeps.

278
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,100
He giving her any trouble ?

279
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,440
She didn't say.

280
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:18,541
But Julie told me that drugs were
always disappearing from that place.

281
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,870
Thanks for your time, Vanessa.

282
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,200
Look, Julie was special.

283
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,410
If there's anything I can do to help,
please don't hesitate to call.

284
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,510
<i>This is a quadrant four
security check.</i>

285
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,870
I've seen an increase in
Trayden activity around here.

286
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,320
<i>This is a quadrant four
security check.</i>

287
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,760
They're coming for us next !

288
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,640
Are you Pete Scanell ?

289
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,170
Fourth quarter, two minutes
to go in a tie game !

290
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,860
We just want to talk, Pete.

291
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,230
Pete, we don't want to hurt you.

292
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,280
Get up. Come on.

293
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,230
Please don't hurt me !

294
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,330
I don't have the map !

295
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,100
Easy, Pete.

296
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,570
You had a heart,
the Traydens would release us.

297
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,440
The map shows the way
to the safety quadrant.

298
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,030
It's where they killed the ethereal body
when the poison reached their skulls.

299
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,990
Pete, can you hear me ?

300
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,110
They sent out a ray of energy
from the inner plane

301
00:15:26,111 --> 00:15:28,511
that helps the listening
devices in the clouds.

302
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,270
Thank you.

303
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,600
Do you have any soda ?

304
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,010
Sure.

305
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,900
The first trayden agent I met
was a nice man.

306
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:40,201
He said quadrant 16 was the safest.

307
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,940
The inner plane map
will tell you everything.

308
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,840
It shows all the hiding places
from the destructive energy.

309
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,170
Do you remember Dr. Ramierez ?

310
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,290
I heard you were a friend of hers.

311
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,400
She's a doctor.
Everyone says I'm sick.

312
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,210
When did you last see her ?

313
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,300
She couldn't stop the screams.

314
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:04,401
<i>"Scared" by John Lennon.</i>

315
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,010
Are we sure we can trust her ?

316
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,910
I think she's dangerous.

317
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,110
I thought you might be here, Pete.

318
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,380
Are you all right ?

319
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,950
After the rain stopped,
a Trayden rainbow appeared.

320
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,251
Rainbows can be used
for etheric travel.

321
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,770
Is that right ? Well, could you
trust dr. Ramierez, Pete ?

322
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,030
You ever want to hurt her ?

323
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,570
Exley knew the danger signs.

324
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,570
He calls me and he
tells me when it's safe.

325
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,050
This exley... He another
patient of Dr. Ramierez ?

326
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,510
Exley's the ensign for
the inner plane soul force.

327
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,970
Oh, yeah ? Well...

328
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,970
Did Exley want to hurt
dr. Ramierez ?

329
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,690
You're one of them, aren't you ?

330
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,400
V-A-L
ensign.

331
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,410
I should have guessed.

332
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,170
How stupid do you think I am ?

333
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,580
It's okay.

334
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:05,081
No, and you are
a Trayden whore !

335
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,170
Hello, Exley.

336
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,700
No. I can't talk right now.

337
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,240
It's not safe.

338
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,990
You never told me you turned
tricks for the Traydens.

339
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,940
I checked the weather
the morning she died.

340
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,300
It was raining.

341
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,100
It's a coincidence.
Nothing he said made sense.

342
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,670
Well, maybe he saw something.

343
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,770
- Like himself killing her ?
- Galton said Pete's not violent.

344
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,730
That guy's a spin doctor
for the mentally ill.

345
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,590
Look, doer or not, Pete's a sick,
scared kid who needs his meds.

346
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,650
And we need answers
about Julie.

347
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:42,751
I think this kid could have them.

348
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,660
He don't know what day it is, Lil.

349
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,620
How did you do with Pete Scanell ?

350
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,920
He might be our guy,

351
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:51,021
but he's making no sense,
he's real bad off.

352
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,570
Well, Vera got a hit on Julie's
gas card the night she died.

353
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,320
7:30 pm she gassed up
her car in Southwark.

354
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,220
Got to be ten miles
from her house.

355
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,990
Nowhere near Tranquility.

356
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,040
Well, 302 Scanell.
Get him with social services.

357
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,350
Boss, we do that, we'll never
get another shot at him alone.

358
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,790
And if he goes off,
we all end up in a jackpot.

359
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,010
Kick him to the shrinks.

360
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,200
What, you couldn't have
told me this before ?

361
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,700
'Cause I was supposed to see him in her
play. Now she's gonna think I forgot.

362
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,550
We'll talk later.

363
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,790
Son of a bitch.

364
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,420
Tough case ?

365
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,230
Yeah.

366
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,680
My ex-wife, aka soulcrusher.

367
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,640
Keeps trading visitation
days with my daughter.

368
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,750
God only knows what she's
telling her about me.

369
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,450
Still owe you that lunch.

370
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,550
Oh, thanks.

371
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,840
So, um, how's it going
with Scanell ?

372
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,760
Well, the judge is playing hardball
with Dr. Ramierez's patient records.

373
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,710
You ask for her personal notes yet ?

374
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,300
Is there a difference ?

375
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,710
Yeah. They're not covered
by confidentiality laws.

376
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,240
What about journals ?

377
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,920
And the wisdom to know
the difference.

378
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,990
Courage and grace to you all.

379
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,970
Good meeting. Keep it clean.

380
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,420
Clean and sober.

381
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,150
Juan Salazar ?

382
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,420
Detectives Vera, Miller.
Philly homicide.

383
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,390
You worked with Julie Ramierez ?

384
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,680
Sure, yeah.
Julie was an amazing soul.

385
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,600
You clean when you were
at Tranquility ?

386
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,450
I was a caseworker.
Helping others.

387
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,670
You mean, helping yourself
to tramadol ?

388
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,770
Got popped for possession
of painkillers

389
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:22,171
two days before Julie died.

390
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,650
I had a relapse.

391
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,890
You know, the journey's always
how we plan it, detectives.

392
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,880
Well, we're going to be taking you on a
journey downtown, you keep lying to us.

393
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,590
Julie find out,
threaten to turn you in ?

394
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:32,691
Get you fired ?

395
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,760
No, and I would never hurt
that angel.

396
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,870
She got me back into rehab.

397
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,830
I was in Arizona when she died.

398
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,960
At hope waters, you know, finding
the sober road. You can check.

399
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,730
You were Pete Scanell's caseworker.
Julie having a tough time with him ?

400
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,140
Hell, no. She worked miracles
for that kid.

401
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:54,080
<i>"#9 dream"
by John Lennon.</i>

402
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,130
I think the music's helping.
He's opening up.

403
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,530
He taking his meds ?

404
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,770
Prolixin-Haloperidol-
Loxitane.

405
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,050
Five, two and two dose.
Like clockwork.

406
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,510
I'm listening to Lennon.

407
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,180
#9 Dream.

408
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,510
Beautiful song.

409
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,810
It makes me feel like
I'm floating when I hear it.

410
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,290
It makes me feel...

411
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,720
Feels like what, Pete ?

412
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,990
Like I'm getting better.

413
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,680
You are getting better.

414
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,920
Thing is, schizophrenics
don't get better.

415
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,640
Maybe music helped calm him,

416
00:20:50,641 --> 00:20:53,141
but all you can really do
is medicate and contain relapses.

417
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,210
Ever see Pete get violent ?

418
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,810
No. The key for a schizophrenic
is finding someone he can trust.

419
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,610
Pete had that in doc Ramierez.

420
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,560
Well, we will check on your sober
road at Hope Waters, Salazar.

421
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,530
Keep it real.

422
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,450
You kick Pete ?

423
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,160
Downstairs.

424
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,870
Boss finds out,
it's your ass, not mine.

425
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,580
Salazar looks good ?

426
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,070
Nope. New age douchebag's
alibi checked out.

427
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,280
Someone else's didn't.

428
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,730
Vanessa Quarterman.

429
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,150
Try Rachel Liebowitz.

430
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,560
Multiple personalities ?

431
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,400
Her rep at that investment bank
said she was just a secretary.

432
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,440
And a pathological liar.

433
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,420
Check fraud, insurance fraud,
shoplifting.

434
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:46,021
Busy woman.

435
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,700
Company made her go into mandatory counseling
for harassing another female employee.

436
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,410
And Julie was her doctor
at Tranquility.

437
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,840
The night Julie died,

438
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:03,141
you said you were at home
with your daughter ?

439
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,210
The one you named after Julie ?

440
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,550
She just started kindergarten.

441
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,410
She can do the whole alphabet
except "w".

442
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,430
Always forgets that one.

443
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,360
Damn, you're good, huh ?

444
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,440
Except "w".

445
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,430
That's a great detail.

446
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,720
- I don't understand.
- Let's cut the crap.

447
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,480
Your daughter's real
name is "don't exist".

448
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,380
You've been in trouble
since you were a kid.

449
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,880
Rachel Liebowitz,
west Philly high dropout.

450
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,290
kappa my ass.

451
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,191
You were Julie's
patient at Tranquility.

452
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,080
You were stalking her.

453
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,620
I would never hurt Julie.

454
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,980
I had an unhealthy obsession

455
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:52,581
called "transfer neurosis."
It's in the dsm iv.

456
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,840
And you're about to spend the night in an unhealthy
place if you don't drop the psychobabble lies.

457
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,290
Julie was a goddess.

458
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,770
I would've walked into
that fire to save her.

459
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,050
Her problem was not with me.

460
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,940
Dr.Jack Galton.

461
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,860
Man was a vindictive blowhard.

462
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,320
And we should believe you why ?

463
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,530
I don't care what you believe.

464
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,050
Guy was in the pants of half the
nurses. He was all wrong for her.

465
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,950
You're saying that was the cause of
the fight ? They were more than friends ?

466
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,980
I think she was gonna
finally dump him.

467
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,810
Last time. Where were
you the night Julie died ?

468
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,960
I really was at home.
I was just alone.

469
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,980
That'll be all, Geneva.

470
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,010
Sorry to barge in, doc. Got a
couple follow-up questions.

471
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,990
Sure. Sit.

472
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,520
You called Julie the night
she died ?

473
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,100
I did.

474
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,780
Where were you ?

475
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,570
I was here working late.
It wasn't like her to not show up.

476
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,680
She didn't answer the phone ?

477
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,530
No. I wish she had.

478
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,010
See, it was a...

479
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,800
12 minute call.

480
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,940
You really just co-workers or
there something more going on ?

481
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,330
- More ?
- Yeah, more,

482
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,870
like she dumps your sorry ass,
you just can't let her go.

483
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,340
You fight on the phone,
drive over...

484
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,020
We were colleagues.
Nothing more.

485
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,380
Of course we had
professional disagreements.

486
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,140
Disagreement turn into
a funeral pyre ?

487
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,430
We were talking about a patient.

488
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,060
I can't discuss it.

489
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,450
Right. Court order.

490
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,690
Well, how about you not discuss it
on the way to the roundhouse ?

491
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,800
I was trying to protect
Julie's memory.

492
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,690
She was misguided,

493
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:01,291
music therapy
for schizophrenia ?

494
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,280
It's... it's absurd.

495
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,480
Yeah, but Pete was doing better.

496
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,180
He had started cheeking.

497
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,400
- Cheeking ?
- Not swallowing his meds.

498
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,850
He'd lie to her about it.

499
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,850
She'd turn a blind eye to it.

500
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:19,251
<i>"Instant karma"
by John Lennon.</i>

501
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,500
Pete, calm down. Relax.

502
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,010
What's wrong ?

503
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,210
Trayden spy! Exley said you
stole his sector five document !

504
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,210
Give it back !

505
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,340
I thought you said
Pete was timid.

506
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,240
A small percentage of schizophrenics
are more prone to violence.

507
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,660
I had to use an extraordinary amount of
mication to calm Pete after that episode.

508
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,970
That why Julie was mad at you ?

509
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,570
She thought I was gorking him.

510
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,850
Gork ? Speak english, doc.

511
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,600
Overmedicating,
turning him into a zombie.

512
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,450
The meds have side effects.

513
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,400
The alternative is worse.

514
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,840
Pete Scanell disappeared
the day before Julie died.

515
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,410
You saying Pete went after her ?

516
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,890
Schizophrenics are always looking
for a safe person, a safe place.

517
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,710
He know where she lived ?

518
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,520
That morning I...

519
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,290
I found him in her office, searching
her purse, going through her mail.

520
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,010
See, this is the sub-portal
transport design.

521
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,820
It'll be a gateway
to the inner plane.

522
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,690
Is the inner plane a
safe place for you, Pete ?

523
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,870
If the vibrations aren't in flux,
I can travel there safely.

524
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,370
Was Dr. Ramierez's house
a safe place for you ?

525
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,280
Pete, when you saw the rainbow,
did you go to her house ?

526
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:43,281
Did you have a key ?

527
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,900
We should not be discussing this.
It's dangerous.

528
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,280
Did Dr. Ramierez ever
go to the inner plane ?

529
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,410
No ! No, she didn't have
clearance !

530
00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:52,611
Exley has clearance.

531
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,510
God, how many times do I have
to tell you people ?

532
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,380
Did she know Mr Exley ?

533
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,600
- Let's take a break, Lil.
- She never met Exley.

534
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,370
I gave her a picture
of him and me.

535
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,880
She kept it in her journal.
It was strange.

536
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,200
What was strange ?

537
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,940
When I gave her the picture...

538
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,990
She started to cry.

539
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,470
Exley does not like
to be photographed.

540
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,090
He understands the danger.
And this is dangerous.

541
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,990
- Dangerous!
- Lil...

542
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,270
It's okay, Pete. We're done.

543
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,020
You keep this guy any longer,
he's liable to hurt himself.

544
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,910
I seen it, Lil.

545
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,560
A guard's watching.

546
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,210
Well, he needs a doctor.

547
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,020
I need to see her journal first. It was
important enough for Pete to mention it.

548
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,950
So you get notes
on the inner plane ?

549
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:36,151
Picture of a guy who isn't real ?

550
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,280
He had no reason
to kill her, Scotty.

551
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,100
Well, maybe Julie set him off.

552
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,730
I mean, he assaulted Galton
over Trayden documents.

553
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,230
We figure out
where he went that day,

554
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:45,931
we put him at the scene
or rule him out.

555
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,630
Holdindesk tells me you still
got Pete Scanell downstairs.

556
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,350
I just need a little more time.

557
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,530
- I told you to 302 him.
- Yeah, sorry, boss.

558
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,540
It was my idea.
We're getting close.

559
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,010
- To what ?
- The truth.

560
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,470
9:00 a.M. I want him gone.

561
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,370
Get lost on the way home, Will ?

562
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,730
I'm back to work.

563
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,510
No, not today, soldier.
Get some rest.

564
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,910
There'll be a nice, comfortable desk
waiting for you when you get back.

565
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,430
What the hell am I gonna do
at home, John ?

566
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,020
Besides, it smells like Vera.

567
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,690
There you go.

568
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,970
Ramierez's journal.

569
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,550
The judge owe you one ?

570
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,910
Just solid case law, my friend.

571
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,620
Requisitioned from a
storage room at Tranquility.

572
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,890
Messengered it over.

573
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,940
Thanks. I owe you...

574
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,380
A new kitty sticker.

575
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,630
Yeah, my daughter's going
through a sticker phase.

576
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,330
Been awhile since I last saw her.

577
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:44,231
This thing's barely holding on.

578
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,640
Never made it to that play ?

579
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:49,040
Uh, no, no. The ex wouldn't budge.

580
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,330
It's like i'm watching a home movie
of her growing up, only I'm not in it.

581
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,180
Sorry to hear.

582
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,610
Yeah, she'd be happy
if I walked away.

583
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,920
Just gave up, you know ?

584
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,720
What about your daughter ?

585
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,850
No, never wanted to
start a tug-o-War.

586
00:29:03,651 --> 00:29:04,351
 What ?

587
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,680
Never seemed like the kinda
guy to give up without a fight.

588
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,610
Exley's real.

589
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,960
Come on, Lil.

590
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,370
Julie was trying to understand
what triggered Pete's illness.

591
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,110
Some kind of trauma, right ?

592
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:44,311
She figured it out.

593
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,380
See, when Pete was six, he was
trapped in a house fire with his older brother.

594
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,490
Brother died in a fire ?

595
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,860
This was clipped inside her journal--
Pete and his brother Michael.

596
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,960
Looks like a happy, healthy kid.

597
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,730
But brother's dressed
exactlylike Pete described Exley.

598
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,600
Well, Galton said the voices a schizophrenic
hears usually start off as a friend.

599
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,630
Or a family member.
It gets better.

600
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,230
The inner plane ?

601
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,590
Check it out.

602
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,060
it's a jungle gym.

603
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,130
His safe place when he was a kid.

604
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,530
Maybe he had one in Philly.

605
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,130
Last entry, the day she died :

606
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:35,331
I think I know where Pete ran.
It's his safe place.

607
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,420
The gas station where Julie filled
up at-- Gotta be a park nearby.

608
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,380
Exley.

609
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,710
Julie found him here.

610
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,730
Maybe she told him exley wasn't
really the ensign of the inner plane.

611
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,750
What's that matter ?

612
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,090
She thought if she talked to Pete
about his trigger, it would help him.

613
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,280
She was fighting his delusion.

614
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,750
Tried to take him away from
the park, the jungle gym...

615
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,730
His safe place.

616
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,140
He got upset...

617
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,420
I was wrong about Pete.

618
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,380
So was Julie.

619
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,270
I just got off the phone
with the CIA.

620
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,870
They want a full report about
the fire at Dr. Ramierez's house.

621
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,230
The CIA ?

622
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,580
You were right, Pete.

623
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,880
There's been an influx
of Trayden activity.

624
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,670
The Traydens are an FBI detail.
Strictly federal.

625
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,700
No, no, this is bigger
than you imagined.

626
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,300
We need your help, Pete.

627
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,880
Can you do that ?
Can you help us out ?

628
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,990
I want to help.

629
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,130
You told me you were sitting with
Exley when you saw the rainbow.

630
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,640
Dr. Ramierez walked towards you.

631
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,900
Exley didn't trust her.

632
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,550
He was right.

633
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,890
Did Dr. Ramierez take you away,
try to trick you ?

634
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,600
- This is dangerous.
- I know it is.

635
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,040
You need to be strong.

636
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,750
You trust me, right ?

637
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,190
- I do.
- Then tell me what happened.

638
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,870
She said Exley wasn't real.

639
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,460
If you deny, you're part of it.

640
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,570
I didn't want to hurt her,
but the Traydens are evil,

641
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:34,090
and their soul force cannot be extinguished
by just any manner of death.

642
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:35,391
They have to burn.

643
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,710
Thanks, Mr Exley.

644
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:07,570
Why would she betray me ?

645
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,990
Pete, Julie was already on the
living room floor when you walked in.

646
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,760
- Yeah.- Well, Pete, how did you
hurt Dr. Ramierez-- Did you hit her ?

647
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,240
I don't remember ; I was tired.

648
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,240
This is important, Pete.

649
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,680
Remember. Close your eyes.
You can do it.

650
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,170
She found you at the park...

651
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,680
And took you home with her.

652
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,640
To listen to music.

653
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,330
We were talking
about the picture.

654
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,010
The picture.
That one with your brother ?

655
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,920
He came back to me in college.

656
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,210
He used to help me,
give me advice, but...

657
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,960
Then he went away.

658
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,930
You used to go to the park
together ?

659
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,330
We used to play on the jungle gym,
watch the other kids on the tire ride.

660
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,050
Watching the wheels.

661
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,000
That's my favorite John Lennon song.

662
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,620
Yeah, it's a good one.

663
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,770
So you didn't get mad when
she talked about your past ?

664
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,150
No.

665
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,870
It just makes me tired.

666
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,450
I...

667
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,190
I didn't want to hurt her.

668
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,830
But I got the call.

669
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:28,870
From Exley ?

670
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,660
Do you remember
what time Exley called ?

671
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,620
I hung up at 10:14.

672
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,540
Saw it on the phone.

673
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,650
Were you on a phone like this ?

674
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,170
No.

675
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,440
Dr. Ramierez gave me her cell phone when she found
me at the park,

676
00:34:48,441 --> 00:34:50,541
said call her if I got lost again.

677
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,360
Then that call was real.

678
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,060
What did Exley tell you ?

679
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,170
He said... Dr. Ramierez was evil.

680
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,470
Yeah ?

681
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,670
That her soul had to be
extinguished.

682
00:35:01,671 --> 00:35:05,771
I burned the house. I hurt her.

683
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,560
You didn't hurt anyone, Pete.
You understand ?

684
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,760
What time was
Galton's phone call to Julie ?

685
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,650
10:02 to 10:14.

686
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,630
This doc had some kind
of personal beef with her.

687
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,810
Or professional.

688
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,500
What else do we know
about the good doctor ?

689
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,760
I appreciate you coming in,
doctor.

690
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,070
Anything to help.

691
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,560
Man, this psychology stuff.

692
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:37,540
All these... disorders,
it's pretty complex.

693
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,970
I've published a number of books
that are easy, for the layman.

694
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,530
Yeah ?

695
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,330
I might have to borrow one.

696
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,060
Uh, I mean, you guys got a
pill for every little problem.

697
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,200
There's one called...

698
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:54,030
Man, these medical words.

699
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,220
Halo...Per...

700
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,060
Haloperidol.

701
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,400
Yeah, yeah, what is that ?

702
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,120
It's a neuroleptic. Helps
alleviate numerous symptoms.

703
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,510
From what I get,
it's basically an antipsychotic.

704
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,110
That's not bad-- I've
been reading this thing.

705
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,770
I'm not sure I follow.

706
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:18,440
We're looking into the medication
that was stolen from the clinic.

707
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:22,610
Uh, burglary report filed
by Tranquility in '04.

708
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,490
Antipsychotics went missing, too.

709
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,700
- You know anything about that ?
- No.

710
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,910
Pete was on haloperidol.

711
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,240
It's used to help treat
schizophrenia.

712
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,100
Thing is, it could also help with, uh,

713
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:36,101
narcissistic personality disorder.

714
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,880
- You familiar with that one ?
- Of course.

715
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,380
Would you mind, uh, reading
the definition out loud ?

716
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,820
'Cause i'll just mess up
the words.

717
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,860
"Symptoms of NPD

718
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:56,361
 are a pervasive
pattern of grandiosity

719
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:58,661
and need for admiration.

720
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,010
patient has a sense of entitlement,
is exploitative,

721
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:04,411
and takes advantage of others
to his own end.

722
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:08,220
shows arrogant behaviors...
or attitudes."

723
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,530
That sounds like a fancy way
of saying someone's a horse's ass.

724
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:15,250
It sounds like someone who'd
make his patients wash his car.

725
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,520
Someone who'd dip
into their money.

726
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,120
And hire former patients
like Geneva

727
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:21,821
to be at his beck and call,

728
00:37:21,921 --> 00:37:23,721
treat him like a king.

729
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,330
Kind of sounds...

730
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,780
Like you.

731
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,630
- What the hell is this ?- You stole
Pete's meds to do a little self-medicating.

732
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,110
That's why he was pissed at you.

733
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,880
Give it back-- He was
talking about his pills.

734
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,820
So what, you're...
you're a doctor now ?

735
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,790
No. But Julie was.

736
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,590
So she diagnosed you with...

737
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,660
Ah, narcissistic personality disorder

738
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:44,661
in her complaint to the AMA.

739
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:45,961
Care to read that one, too ?

740
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,440
- I don't have to listen to this.
- Of course not...

741
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,010
You're the executive director of
the Pennsylvania medical group.

742
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,920
Diagnosed by a woman who'd only
been practicing three years.

743
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,180
You've written books...

744
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,070
That sold 12 copies.

745
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,770
You know, maybe she was right.
Incompetent, arrogant and abusive.

746
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,140
You sure you went to med school, doc ?

747
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,820
Julie'd be running that place
by now if she were still alive.

748
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:09,020
But unlike you, she actually cared
about her patients, about helping people.

749
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,060
I care deeply.

750
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,410
You people have no idea...

751
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,160
The good work I do.

752
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,320
I have won countless
grants and honors.

753
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,630
I have set therapeutic goals
for patients

754
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:23,631
that Julie was too narrow-minded
to comprehend.

755
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,990
I have patients that
admire and respect me.

756
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,800
Me ! Not julie ! Me !

757
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,590
So you went to her house
to straighten her out.

758
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,260
- You bet I did.
- But she wouldn't listen to you.

759
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:37,520
She had to be stopped.
She was sick.

760
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,670
I called you earlier, and...

761
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,350
Pete Scanell answered.

762
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,840
What's going on, Julie ?

763
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,750
I gave him my cell phone,
just in case.

764
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,710
You gave him your phone ?
When ?

765
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,610
He can't be on the street,
Dr. Galton.

766
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,850
So, you brought him home
with you.

767
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,600
He's... he's asleep in the basement.
He needs a place to stay.

768
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,880
So you think he's better off here
than at Tranquility.

769
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,240
He said he ran away because you
took something from his room.

770
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,390
This from a kid who
hallucinates on a daily basis.

771
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,900
I believe him, Jack...
You took his meds.

772
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,370
He has no concept of reality.
The disease eradicated it.

773
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:25,040
The disease didn't eradicate
his sense of honesty, his soul.

774
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,340
He's a good kid,
and I believe in him.

775
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,590
And you say I cross lines.

776
00:39:28,591 --> 00:39:29,191
Excuse me ?

777
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,070
The complaint you filed
against me with the AMA.

778
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,290
You didn't think I'd find out
about that, the people I know ?

779
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,680
- Please, keep your voice down.
- Don't tell me what to do.

780
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,900
I've seen with my own eyes
how you treat the patients.

781
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,470
Tomorrow you will call the AMA
and tell them you made a mistake.

782
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,080
I'm sorry, jack, I can't do that.

783
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,230
You will do what I say !

784
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,490
I think you need help.

785
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,630
Dr. Kellerman is expecting
your call.

786
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,410
What, what, uh, what,
you're gonna analyze me ?

787
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,020
You're sick, Jack.

788
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,600
Sick ? I treat the sick.

789
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,010
You're not helping them.

790
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,760
You've got to help yourself first.

791
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,980
You know nothing!

792
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,550
Pete.

793
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:36,451
It's Exley.

794
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,130
There's a problem I need you
to take care of.

795
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,240
Good news, Pete.

796
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:55,730
I found a caseworker who pulled some
strings, got you in a board and care.

797
00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:00,570
They'll get you back on your meds,
take care of you.

798
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,360
Okay.

799
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,770
And I want you to know...

800
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,680
Julie believed in you.

801
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,130
You understand ?

802
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,530
Uh, Ms. Rush ?

803
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,120
Yes ?

804
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,990
This place...

805
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,810
You've done a sweep for listening
devices-- It's safe, right ?

806
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,800
It's safe, Pete.
