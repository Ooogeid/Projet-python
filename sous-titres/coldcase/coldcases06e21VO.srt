00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,040
********

3
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:16,041
<i>"Green onions"
by Booker T. and The MG's.</i>

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,520
Aw, come on. Of all the shots,
you leave me with cross side.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,170
I'm screwed.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,220
You know, so-called
experts stroll in here,

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,680
"Hey, angle this, angle that."
Blah, blah, blah.

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,100
You know what pool is
most of the time ?

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,600
Luck.

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,460
And I definitely don't have it !

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,300
Thanks a lot, cue ball.
I don't need to win.

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,840
Why don't you lay smack
next to the eight there ?

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,780
Right where you want him, Duke.

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,750
Would you look at that ?
Boy, oh, boy.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,360
Bartender, couple shots of Jack
for me and the hustler over here.

16
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,930
Come on. Let's roll again.

17
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,190
What do you say, $75 ?

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,680
$150 for the rack ?

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,900
$150 ? Oh, I don't know.

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,700
All right, forget it.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,740
You know what ? Why not ?

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,800
I'm feeling lucky,
like you said.

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,300
Oh, by the way,

24
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,970
let me introduce myself.
I'm the Duke.

25
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,250
I know who you are.

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,530
So many to choose from.

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,390
Corner.

28
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,980
Side.

29
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,350
What the hell, cross bank ?

30
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,770
I am just so damn lucky.

31
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,300
By the way, Duke,

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,020
my name's Patrick Lennox.

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,160
And you can tell all
the other yuks in Mayberry

34
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:54,261
that they gotta come see
the Rifle.

35
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,970
Shoots fast, never misses.

36
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,360
Think you're top dog
at the table, do you ?

37
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,630
Yes, ma'am, I do.

38
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,390
The great Baltimore Red's
got nothing on me.

39
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,340
I'd get going, I was you.

40
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,180
My friends, I bid you adieu.

41
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,810
<i>As we told you a moment ago,</i>

42
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,700
<i>President Kennedy was assassinated
in Dallas, Texas today.</i>

43
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,620
<i>He was shot at 12:25</i>

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,670
<i>as his car proceed through
the crowded streets of Dallas.</i>

45
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,660
<i>From John John to his father :
a last salute.</i>

46
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,600
Gamblers with sticks,

47
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,800
it's a dangerous combination.

48
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,840
New owner's got evidence
on a Patrick Lennox,

49
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,440
a pool hustler, killed
the same day as Kennedy.

50
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,970
Lennox was known as
"The Rifle."

51
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:09,471
Cut down before getting his picture
on Whitey's wall of fame.

52
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,320
Gonna see
your mug up here, Boss ?

53
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,280
Don't I wish. Fats, Wimpy Lassiter...
Back in the day,

54
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,300
Whitey's was famous for pool,
gambling, and police raids.

55
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,420
Who's that ?

56
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,620
It's Baltimore Red.

57
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,760
Any of 'em have real names ?

58
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,250
Legend was he'd run 15 racks
in Hoboken,

59
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,851
then do it in Skokie a day later.

60
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,910
Nobody knew where he was from,
who he was.

61
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:31,811
Real mystery man.

62
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,450
They say Lennox was supposed
to play him

63
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:35,651
right here at Whitey's night
before he died,

64
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,150
but neither of 'em showed.

65
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,820
Scotty, Lil, Tom Puckett.

66
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,530
He's bringing Whitey's
back to life.

67
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,690
Open next week.

68
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:43,691
That's, of course, if my liquor license
comes through...

69
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,610
Let's see what you got first, buddy.

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,740
Found it shoved way back
in a cue holder

71
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,990
When I saw the date on the newspaper
it was wrapped in, I figured...

72
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,710
.32 snub nose.

73
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,890
Excuse me for a second.

74
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,670
ME report says this "Rifle"

75
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,771
was killed with a.32.
One shot.

76
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,570
Got a spent casing.

77
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,970
Fired once.

78
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,950
"Kennedy Shot In Dallas,
November 22, 1963."

79
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,300
Papers ran five or six extra
editions the day of the assassination.

80
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,580
This one went out at 3:00 p.m.

81
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,290
It matches up.ME listed time
of death approximately 2:00 P.M.

82
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,150
He was killed in Chestnut Hill.

83
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,510
What's a pool hustler
doing over in la-di-da land ?

84
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,920
There's nothing in the file.

85
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,220
Why's no one say squat
about it for 40 years ?

86
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,430
Hustlers and cops, Scotty.
Not exactly bosom buddies.

87
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,660
Maybe the Rifle hustled
the wrong shark ?

88
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,580
And it earned him a bullet.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,070
Cold Case
Season 6 Episode 21

90
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,310
Transcript VO : www.ydy.com

91
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,260
November 22nd

92
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,820
Patrick Lennox. Early
30s. No next of kin.

93
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,290
Gunshot wound to the back.

94
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,110
It was a .32 caliber round
recovered.

95
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,800
Ballistics says body bullet

96
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:14,401
matches the revolver
from Whitey's.

97
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,750
Got our murder weapon.

98
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,640
And surprise, surprise-- no
registered owner on the gun.

99
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,350
I'll contact the manufacturer.
Maybe they know who the dealer was.

100
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,300
A motel key in Lennox's pocket

101
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:25,501
led assigned to
the Broad Street Motel.

102
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,180
Manager ID'd him from the registries.

103
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,180
No address listed.

104
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,390
Bunch of train ticket
stubs on him :

105
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,420
Detroit... Pittsburgh... Trenton.

106
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,580
All about a month apart.

107
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,390
Arrives in Philly November 1.

108
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,030
Gets a match with this
Baltimore Red on the 21st.

109
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,590
Supposed to happen at Whitey's,
but neither of 'em shows.

110
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,630
Body found 14 hours
later in Chestnut Hill.

111
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,970
Police canvassed the neighborhood.
There were no witnesses.

112
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,940
It was broad daylight.
No one sees nothing ?

113
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,860
Half hour after Kennedy's shot ?

114
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,150
Everybody was glued to their TVs.

115
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,880
In three gunshots, the '60s begun.

116
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,840
I was playing touch football
at recess.

117
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,290
Recess ?

118
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,180
Thought you were, like,
45 when that happened.

119
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,530
You're thinking of
when Lincoln was shot.

120
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,040
Keep it up.
See what happens.

121
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,460
Boss was right.

122
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,450
Whitey's was the raid capital
of Philly back in the day.

123
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,100
Lennox was busted there for
bookmaking November 3, 1963.

124
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,760
Couple weeks before he was murdered.

125
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,150
Could be related.

126
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,620
Check this out.

127
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,060
Clerk listed a local guy,

128
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:28,861
John Norwood, bailing him out.

129
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,920
Puckett says this Norwood guy was
a fixture at Whitey's in the day ;

130
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:32,921
he coached younger players.

131
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,080
We get a line on him ?

132
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,130
Living it up
at Green Acres Retirement.

133
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,300
Vera and Minnesota Skinny are
on their way to see him now.

134
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,090
John Norwood ?

135
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,210
Sure am. Who's asking ?

136
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,210
Philly Homicide.

137
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,040
You hung out at Whitey's
in '63 ?

138
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,150
In '64,

139
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,510
'65,'66.
Place was a goldmine.

140
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,320
How about Patrick Lennox ?

141
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,570
Lennox ?

142
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,830
Never heard of him.

143
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,970
You got a habit

144
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:04,271
of bailing guys out of jail
you never heard of ?

145
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,940
Oh, that guy.

146
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,820
I bailed him out, sure.

147
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,510
Kid had the mortal nuts.

148
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,550
A great stick with no fear.

149
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,810
But his game was flawed.
Shame he got killed.

150
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,170
What can you tell us
about that ?

151
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,490
Nothing, really.
It was a long time ago.

152
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,860
Well, maybe you can remember
where you were when JFK got shot ?

153
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,000
Am I a suspect in that, too ?

154
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,340
Ain't decided yet.

155
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,040
Look, I was at Whitey's

156
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,941
watching Cronkite all day.

157
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,840
Give you names,
you don't believe me.

158
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,910
After you bailed Lennox out,
you straighten his game out, too ?

159
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,450
No, that kid was more trouble
than he was worth.

160
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,970
You see Red, you tell him
the Rifle's in town.

161
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,770
********

162
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,690
See how you got your nickname.

163
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,170
But you bring that
crap to Baltimore Red,

164
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,290
he'll knock you all over the felt.

165
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,870
You talking to me...

166
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:03,271
"Doctor" ?

167
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,220
I's looking at you, ain't I ?

168
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,560
You know Red ?

169
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,860
That ain't the point.

170
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,580
He strolls in,
you better be ready.

171
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,980
He's the one who better be ready.

172
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,950
You don't have the game
to back the hustle.

173
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,380
You're gonna get your ass kicked,and
I don't mean in the abstract.

174
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,940
You're the guy who's
been watching me shoot.

175
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,590
Your name Norwood ?

176
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,330
I like "Doctor" better.

177
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,140
You bailed me out.

178
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,180
Look at the table.

179
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,240
What's your third shot ?

180
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,470
Can't even answer that, huh ?

181
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:33,271
You gotta think bigger.

182
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,300
You know what happens when
you see your third shot ?

183
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,760
I don't care, you bag of wind.

184
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,830
I'll get there when I get there.

185
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,080
You stubborn bastard.

186
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:48,281
Stop drinking like a boiled owl
and clean out your ears.

187
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,870
The only thing that kid
left me with was a nickname :

188
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,890
"Doctor."

189
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,770
Who's the guy that turned Lennox
into a ghost ?

190
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,630
"Monkey" Mack.

191
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,310
Why was Lennox running
from him ?

192
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,660
They were partners
years before in Philly.

193
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,600
Story was they hustled
the wrong stakehorse

194
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:18,101
for a chunk of change.

195
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,940
And after that,
Lennox left town ?

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,450
Left the stakehorse with two arms
to break instead of four.

197
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,790
Where's Miller with the gun ?

198
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,610
Manufacturer sold it
to a traveling gun show.

199
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,960
Still in business.
She's checking to see who bought it.

200
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,170
- Here you go, Will.
- Thanks, Lenny.

201
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,660
Can't be a harder find
than this "Baltimore Red."

202
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,670
You check Baltimore ?

203
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,930
Yeah, good idea.

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,060
Nobody uses that alias in
Baltimore or anywhere else.

205
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,040
How 'bout a little hoagie
with that Tabasco sauce ?

206
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,650
Better than that bologna
situation you got going on.

207
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,930
Least mine's got taste.

208
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,500
Not that you would know.
Inhale the whole damn thing anyway.

209
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,110
All right, all right.

210
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,140
That Monkey Mack, a real tool :

211
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,120
burglary, assault, you name it.

212
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,310
Sounds like a regular dumpster fire.

213
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,240
Gets better.

214
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:06,141
Genius was busted
with a .32 three times.

215
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,520
Where's he now ?

216
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:10,221
Same place he spent
half his natural life.

217
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,380
A name like "Monkey," life behind bars,

218
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,680
kind of a self-fulfilling
prophecy, ain't it ?

219
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,940
Heard 'em all before.

220
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,010
Not from Philly Homicide.

221
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,590
Understand you had
a score to settle

222
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:30,991
with Patrick Lennox,
November '63.

223
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,970
Been settling scores my whole life.

224
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,330
One with Lennox ended
with a .32,

225
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:37,031
your weapon of choice.

226
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,860
Patrick ditched Philly after
some dame broke his heart.

227
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,700
The punks that he screwed over...
they took it out on me.

228
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,830
Got any names ?

229
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,300
Yeah, Jagoff One and Jagoff Two.

230
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,190
Hoping they're both dead by now.

231
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,250
Remember where you were
when Kennedy got shot ?

232
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,570
Praying to a porcelain God,

233
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,670
hung over like a sheet
on a clothesline.

234
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,920
Not much of an alibi.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,660
You heard Lennox
was back in town.

236
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,961
What happened
when you found him ?

237
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,030
Offered me a few shots of Beam,
spotted me five on a rack.

238
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,750
It's water under the bridge.

239
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,160
Besides,I wasn't the
only one looking for him.

240
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,480
********

241
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,010
Cheers.

242
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,060
To the jerk who swore
he'd never be back.

243
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,360
I heard Red was here last week.

244
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,610
Baltimore Red ?
Yeah, right.

245
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,940
Think he's ever going
to play you ?

246
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,970
I'm tracking him down. Prove I
ain't like these other pool bums.

247
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,860
Always got to be the best.

248
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,570
Thought this was a "bad luck" town.

249
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,010
Yeah. When I beat him,

250
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,360
I ain't going to have to sweat
a measly 20 thou anymore.

251
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,680
Still dodging that debt ?

252
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,190
Rumor is Red only runs
two grand a game.

253
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,620
You know what ?
I'll make that up in no time.

254
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,860
Ain't you heard ? I'm the Rifle.

255
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,780
No, no. Sorry, little miss.
No kids allowed.

256
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,030
Kid ? I look older than you, buddy.

257
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,530
Out.

258
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,590
But I'm here to see my dad.

259
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,600
Oh, yeah ? Which one of
these princes is your dad ?

260
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,230
Him.

261
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,760
What ? Sorry. Me ?

262
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,680
So, what, you have a...
You got a screw loose, kid ?

263
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,390
You're Patrick Lennox, ain't you ?

264
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,160
I'm Hill. Hillary Rhodes.

265
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,930
Rhodes ?

266
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,660
That's Sandra.

267
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,900
Here are the letters you wrote her.

268
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,900
Knocked her up right before you
guys took a drive to splitsville.

269
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,280
Found them few months
before she died.

270
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,850
- She's dead ?
- Six months ago.

271
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,510
She never told you about me ?

272
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,400
This really is a bad luck town.

273
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,770
Sandra. The gift that kept on giving.

274
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,950
Lennox take her in ?

275
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,700
Saw him shooting a week later.

276
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,560
Kid was still hanging on his sleeve.

277
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,890
Well, sit tight, Monkey.
Might be back.

278
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,280
Well, Lennox comes back
to find "Baltimore Red", 

279
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:01,781
but Hillary finds him first.

280
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,780
Two weeks later, he's dead.

281
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,010
Maybe his bad luck had
nothing to do with pool.

282
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,490
Not many people know
Patrick was my dad.

283
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,940
He teach you to play ?

284
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,210
Laid a foundation, I guess.

285
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,320
Dads are tricky.
What they leave us with.

286
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,190
Take what you can get, right ?

287
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,360
Still... Best two weeks of my life.

288
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,800
You were with him the day
he died ?

289
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,910
The night before,
until he left the motel.

290
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,411
I waited for him to come back.

291
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,870
But he never did.

292
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,750
So I went looking for him.

293
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,410
<i>He was shot as he took
part in a motorcade.</i>

294
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,760
<i>which was driving him
to the Dallas Trade Mart...</i>

295
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,480
<i>The word we have is
that he is dead.</i>

296
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,520
<i>He was shot by an assassin</i>

297
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,820
<i>at the intersection of
Elm and Houston Street.</i>

298
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,500
Sounds dumb.

299
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,920
I thought they were
all crying for my dad.

300
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,510
You know where he was headed ?

301
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,330
Heard a couple days later he
had a match with Baltimore Red.

302
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,330
The match go down ?

303
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,480
Don't know.

304
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,681
Split soon as the cops started
sniffing around our room.

305
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,750
Anyone else you can think of
might have been angry at your dad ?

306
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,590
Guys he owed money to, maybe ?

307
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,910
Not guys.

308
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,340
Was the opposite sex who
wanted his head on a platter.

309
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,020
I like this hotel.
Can we stay here ?

310
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,720
Motel.Don't get used to it.

311
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,280
Too late.

312
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,780
You're only here till
I get a run at "Red".

313
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,140
And then I'm gone.And
you're on your own.

314
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,830
You've been saying that every
five minutes since I got here.

315
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,660
Admit it : you like me.

316
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,660
What I like is
that a hustler sees you

317
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:40,961
and thinks I'm some sap
ham-and-egger,

318
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,500
lets his guard down.

319
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,710
So where's my cut ?

320
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,340
Cut ?

321
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,680
All you did was yell at me,
"You stink, Dad !"

322
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,110
And besides,I still need 400
bucks before I can play Red.

323
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,770
Going to need me to get it.

324
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,080
Five bucks ?

325
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,070
I would do cartwheels if someone
gave me five bucks at your age.

326
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,870
You sticky-finger this
at the five-and-dime ?

327
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,030
So ?

328
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,890
Well... stealing is bad.

329
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,240
Pittsburgh's a drag.

330
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,690
Next time we got to land a mark

331
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:29,991
ain't such a chatterbox
like The Duke...

332
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,730
Who's the brat ?

333
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,620
His daughter. Who's the tramp ?

334
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,350
Daughter ?

335
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,790
You buy that for her, Patrick ?

336
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,970
No, she stole it.

337
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,340
Don't lie, Daddy.

338
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:46,341
You got it at Wanamaker's
after you won today.

339
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,180
- Give me that.
- Don't pick on the kid.

340
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,540
- Give it back.
- It's mine.

341
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,530
I sat on a Greyhound for six hours.

342
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,750
Thought you had a lead on Red.

343
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,420
This isn't Pittsburgh, Blondie.

344
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,120
Your good looks are not going
to distract a shooter like Red.

345
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,930
And neither will a scamp kid.

346
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,520
She was mean.

347
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,530
Ready to take me out
over a two-dollar trinket.

348
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,120
Catch a name ?

349
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,490
Sharon something.
He called her "Blondie," mostly.

350
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,710
She was a poor man's Marilyn Monroe,
fake mole and everything.

351
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,190
- He ever see her again ?
-  Don't know.

352
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,810
But if she did that to me,

353
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,180
I can only imagine what she would've
done to my dad for cutting her out.

354
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,190
Not bad.

355
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,860
We got this case.

356
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,580
A guy was killed practically
the same time as Kennedy.

357
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,430
I was 19.

358
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,950
Remember it
like it was yesterday.

359
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,180
Where were you ?

360
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,020
On a construction site.

361
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,950
Then there was Ruby and the funeral.

362
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,370
Thought the world was ending.

363
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,010
Hello ?

364
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,350
Uh, yeah.

365
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,530
Hour or so.

366
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,240
Okay. Bye-bye.

367
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,240
Sorry.

368
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,150
They don't know about me ?

369
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,370
My family ?

370
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,610
They do. Just not,uh...

371
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,920
It's complicated.

372
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,060
Complicated ? Right.

373
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,460
Lilly,listen.

374
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,470
I got to go.

375
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,220
Baltimore Red. Wimpy Lassiter.
The Rifle.

376
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,460
Ridiculous.

377
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,250
Every banger I tracked had
some kind of nickname, too.

378
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,590
This one, Snoopy.

379
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,350
Searched every doghouse,
outhouse...

380
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:52,551
Guess where I found him ?

381
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,190
On-line dating ?

382
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,360
Dude was pumping gas
next to me,

383
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:58,061
big old Snoopy medallion
around his neck.

384
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,170
I'm beginning to wonder if this
Baltimore Red really exists.

385
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,430
Like hunting down Godot.

386
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,700
Who ?

387
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,740
Guess that one passed you by.
It's a play.

388
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,020
Since when did you start
reading plays ?

389
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,660
Since Ms. Kipplebottom told me

390
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:13,161
I'd never amount to anything
if I didn't ace my final exam.

391
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,620
Served you well.

392
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:17,921
Since the police test
is chock-full of theater questions.

393
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,610
Miller, got something for you.

394
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,330
A traveling gun dealer
faxed you a name.

395
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,800
Larry Sidorski.

396
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,530
Bought his .32 at a show
in Maryland in '61.

397
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,820
Couldn't be our doer, though.
Talked with his ex.

398
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,330
He was on a ship for the Merchant
Marines when Kennedy was shot.

399
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,760
So it was stolen or
he gave it to someone.

400
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,590
Well,I'll hit up ATF and
Staties in Maryland,

401
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:37,891
help track him down.

402
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,150
You guys talk to any Sharons
while you were out ?

403
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,260
Rush is looking for
the poor man's Marilyn, mole and all.

404
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,600
Sharon Lertola.

405
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,640
Picked up in a raid ten
days before the murder.

406
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,810
Do you remember
November 22, 1963 ?

407
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,480
I can barely remember my orders
from this morning.

408
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,230
Day Kennedy was shot.

409
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,670
I went to a picture.

410
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,730
"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World".

411
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,560
And the usher came in halfway
through and made the announcement.

412
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,470
You hustle your way
into that theater ?

413
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,840
No.

414
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,360
I'd given that up by then.

415
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,240
So why'd you show up at Patrick's
motel room two weeks earlier ?

416
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,990
Well, we were still road agents
at the time.

417
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,900
I would get the men
to ante up,

418
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,250
and Patrick would take them down.
And then we'd meet up in another town

419
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,050
if Patrick found action.

420
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,400
Good honest living.

421
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,910
We saw the world the same way.

422
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,120
One big joke on all of life's pigeons.

423
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,120
It made us great partners
while it lasted.

424
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,570
- Two of you romantic ?
- Oh, no. Strictly business.

425
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,290
Patrick was top dog at the table.

426
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,220
I wanted to cash in as long I could.

427
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,610
So why'd you trade it in ?

428
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,230
Eh, lifestyle gets old.
So I quit.

429
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,470
Way we heard it, Lennox was
the one cutting you out.

430
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,580
Who told you that, his kid ?

431
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,120
I know I'd be pissed,
I got bumped like that.

432
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,050
Best thing that ever happened to me,
splitting from that two-bit.

433
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,050
How so ?

434
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:14,751
Patrick always said that Philly
was a bad-luck town.

435
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,910
Truth is, it was Patrick
who was bad luck.

436
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,900
********

437
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,850
Could have ran it if you
cornered me few shots back.

438
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,330
That's my whole bank.

439
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,140
Now it's my bank.

440
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,100
I like your style, Mr. Rifle.

441
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,110
Check his heel.

442
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,900
Three bucks ?
That's all you got ?

443
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,930
Life of the hustle catches up
with everyone sooner or later.

444
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,410
- Who was the thug ?
- Ben... Scavo.

445
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,890
But I don't know
who his flunky was.

446
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,260
He the guy Patrick
owed 20 grand to ?

447
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,460
I don't know.

448
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,650
But I do know Patrick wasn't the
first one he'd wiped the floor with.

449
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,230
Found Ben Scavo, the thug
who took down Lennox.

450
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,800
Boxer over at Mason's Gym.

451
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,270
Stroked out five years ago,
but look at this.

452
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,120
Scavo's ring name was "Lightning."

453
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,090
And that right there
is Monkey Mack.

454
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,360
Scavo's cut man.

455
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:47,061
Well, he'd sure as hell know
where Lennox kept his stash.

456
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,840
Sends "Lightning" after Lennox,
retribution for the broken arms.

457
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,310
Problem is three bucks ain't going
to get a Monkey off your back.

458
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,600
Can't stand prosperity,
can you, Monkey ?

459
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,910
About to make parole...

460
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,800
And you lie to us.

461
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,980
What're you talking about ?
I never lie.

462
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,510
Said the last time you saw
Lennox,things were all good.

463
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,910
Left out the part how you set him
up to be pummeled by your boy Scavo.

464
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,090
You didn't ask about that.

465
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,870
Don't hustle us, Monkey.

466
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,080
My life's a hustle, Detective.

467
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,470
Cry me a river.

468
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,800
You send Scavo back in for the knockout
when he only gets you three bucks ?

469
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,280
I didn't need to.

470
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,160
I got paid in the end.

471
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,110
*********

472
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,410
It's not enough for you getting
busted up, but it's gonna have to do.

473
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,400
I never want to see your face again.

474
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,710
Why do you play pool?

475
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,160
Well... there's nothing
more important than pool.

476
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,620
What about swimming pools ?

477
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,520
I'll tell you what,Hill.

478
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,720
When I beat Red,I'll take you
swimming in the biggest pool there is.

479
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,960
See,I told you you liked me.

480
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,840
Are you scared when you play ?

481
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,870
Why you ask silly stuff like that ?

482
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,190
I know you got beat up, Dad.

483
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,100
That's no way to live.

484
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,720
All's you care about is beating
this "Baltimore Red" guy ?

485
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,370
You're solids.

486
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,080
What's your third shot ?

487
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,790
Know what happens when
you find your third shot?

488
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,240
You see your fourth, your fifth, your
sixth, your seventh, and your eighth.

489
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,890
Four ball.

490
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,170
That'd be my third shot.

491
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,380
You know,I really loved your ma.

492
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,670
I know.

493
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,650
Last thing she said to me,letting you
go was the worst mistake of her life.

494
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,580
Why do you look over
your shoulder like that ?

495
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,880
And what is with
this face... this... ?

496
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,140
That's what you do.

497
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,150
Even when you win,
you look like you're mad as hell.

498
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,490
Why'd your ma name you Hill ?

499
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,890
She won money off of Hill Gail
in the Kentucky Derby

500
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:31,291
couple weeks before she had me.

501
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,410
Said I was lucky.
Lucky Hill.

502
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,450
That horse was a boy.

503
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,700
She wanted a boy, okay ?

504
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,050
You sure it was the Derby ?

505
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,850
Why ?

506
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,030
Never mind.

507
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,390
Take your shot.

508
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,650
Seemed like a cool kid.

509
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,690
Even Whitey didn't care
if she hung around.

510
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,680
This technique he was teaching :
third shot, looking ahead..

511
00:25:01,681 --> 00:25:02,581
that his thing ?

512
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,100
He must have learned that somewhere.

513
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,570
Really picked up his game
the last few weeks.

514
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,420
He working with anyone
you knew about ?

515
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,660
No.

516
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,610
Only saw him with the kid.

517
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,290
Acted like he didn't give a rat's ass,

518
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,020
but she really got to him.

519
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,460
Hello, "Doctor".

520
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,040
I was wondering if you could teach me
one of those trick shots you mentioned.

521
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,090
It would be great to impress the crew.

522
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,980
I got one for you.

523
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,030
This will make 'em flip.

524
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,080
Hit the cue right here, hard.

525
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,740
You'll clear the table.
Bend your knees.

526
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,680
Well, it takes practice.

527
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,140
What is it, three shots ahead ?

528
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,770
Then you see your fourth,
fifth, and sixth ?

529
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,940
Figured this wasn't just about pool.

530
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,820
You coach Lennox.
He beats Red. You get a cut.

531
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,510
How did you convince him
to take you on ?

532
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,550
Didn't. He came to me after
losing to some house player.

533
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,820
His whole outlook was different.

534
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,290
And you set the match up
with Red ?

535
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,010
No. Somebody contacted Patrick,

536
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,020
said, "Be at Whitey's.
Red wants a match.

537
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,480
Two-grand stake."

538
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,960
Who fronted the money ?

539
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,780
Don't know. Don't think
Patrick did either.

540
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,210
Whole thing was a mystery.

541
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,020
Why did you lie about working
with him ?

542
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,230
My only job was to coach him.

543
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,650
And I crossed the line.

544
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:31,751
................

545
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,010
Table's slop. Tap the cue off
the rail, jaw it behind the two.

546
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,810
{\a6}You don't safety it,
he'll run you.

547
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,020
Try it again. It ain't easy.

548
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,450
Everything good, Paddy ?

549
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,800
Yeah. I was thinking about Red.

550
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,090
Master the safeties,
he won't know what hit him.

551
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,610
Match is at midnight, Paddy.
Told you, no distractions.

552
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,330
Hey, I thought we were
gonna get some burgers.

553
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,600
Get lost, kid.

554
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,030
Get lost, kid. You get lost.

555
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,470
I mean it. Get out of here.

556
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,820
- But, Dad...
- I'm done playing dad.

557
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,840
Leave me alone.

558
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,060
The look in that kid's eyes.

559
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,080
It was me who told him :
either the kid or the game.

560
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,750
This was the afternoon
of the match ?

561
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,120
November 21st.

562
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,540
The last time I saw him.

563
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,850
Not a day goes by

564
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:49,651
I wouldn't give my right arm to have
someone around who loves me

565
00:27:49,652 --> 00:27:51,552
as much as that kid loved him.

566
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,490
Want to shoot a quick one ?

567
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,610
Maybe another time, "Doctor".

568
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,820
- Finished it already?
- Halfway.

569
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,580
Liked it that much,huh?

570
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,960
If I was by a bush waiting
for you or Nick, I'd just leave.

571
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,850
You do know they're
waiting for God, right ?

572
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,870
Is that what Ms. Kipplebottom
told you ?

573
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,860
Figured out why Lennox might have
ditched the kid,

574
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:24,961
and it had nothing to do
with Norwood's advice.

575
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,250
Kentucky Derby ?

576
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,570
Race Hill Gail won two weeks
before Hillary was born.

577
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,190
Check the date.

578
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,100
May 3, 1952.

579
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:37,320
But Patrick left Philly for
the Coast Guard in June of '51.

580
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,840
That's an 11-month difference.

581
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,780
Kid wasn't really his daughter.

582
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,030
No, Hillary Rhodes was more of a
hustler than the Rifle himself.

583
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,940
Got your birth certificate
from Vital Records.

584
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,840
Want to read that date to us ?

585
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,250
May 18...

586
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,930
1952.

587
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,120
11 months after Patrick
Lennox entered the Coast Guard.

588
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,730
Reason a lot of people don't know
he's your father, Hillary:

589
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:06,931
he isn't.

590
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,510
- You working your own scam on him ?
- What ? No.

591
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,830
11-year-old kid, someone put you up to it ?
Distract him before the big match ?

592
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,210
I would never have done that.

593
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,780
You'd just lie about him being your dad.

594
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,010
- What aren't you telling us, Hillary ?
- Nothing. I swear.

595
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,350
I just wanted a father.

596
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,580
But he didn't want me.

597
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,430
Lied to us once.

598
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,180
Please, what do you want
from me ?

599
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,990
- The truth.
- I was gonna tell him. I was.

600
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,550
When, huh ?

601
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,820
Ten years from now ?

602
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,690
That crap you fed me
about your ma...

603
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,991
she never said one word
about it, did she ?

604
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,590
Did she ?!

605
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,310
No.

606
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:03,640
Yeah ? Sure .
I'm on my way.

607
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,060
It was the only way
you'd stay with me.

608
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,530
Please don't leave...

609
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,260
You don't be here
when I get back.

610
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,170
Please.

611
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,310
I got nowhere else to go.

612
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,910
He drove away.

613
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,990
I never saw him again.

614
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,600
- Who was that on the phone ?
- I don't know.

615
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,440
Dads are tricky.

616
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,920
What they leave us with.

617
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,850
Right, Detective Rush ?

618
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,370
Least I know why he did it.

619
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,540
I drove him away.

620
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,630
You all right ?

621
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,830
I don't need this.

622
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,590
Give it to someone else.

623
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,500
Lilly...

624
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,690
I've never been one for the spiritual
mumbo-jumbo. Save it for one of your kids.

625
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,900
Wait a minute.

626
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,320
I'm going to tell them, Lil.
I'm not trying to hide anything.

627
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,640
You think I care ?

628
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,670
I'm not asking you to throw
some kind of reunion picnic.

629
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,510
Things don't happen overnight.
It takes time.

630
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,140
For what ?

631
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,690
I'm not a mistake
you have to hide.

632
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,060
It's not that simple.

633
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:41,930
Forget it. You're a good guy,
and I wish you the best.

634
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,430
Don't you just walk away now.

635
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,050
- No, that's your act, remember, Dad ?
- Oh, here we go.

636
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,620
You left me with her !

637
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,430
You know what that was like ?

638
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,710
You bet I do.

639
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,550
Then why didn't you take me
with you ?

640
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,180
I did what I thought
was best for everyone.

641
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,130
You did what was best for you.

642
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,930
You give me some stupid medal.

643
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,580
Play a couple of games of chess.

644
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,480
- Give me a break.
- Look, you came to me.

645
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,510
You want to have a relationship ? At
some point we got to put this behind us.

646
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,090
If this is how you want to do it--
your head in the sand, no, thanks.

647
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,230
You're talking about 30 years ago.

648
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,060
You want me to dredge it all up ?

649
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,780
That what you're asking here ?

650
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,990
Well, I'm not going to do it.

651
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,220
There are things, some things,
that are not your damn business.

652
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,420
I'm not giving explanations.

653
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,370
Worked a long time
to get where I am,

654
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:28,171
and I'm not going to dredge it all up,
you hear ?

655
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,300
Your mother... damn it,
if that's what you're looking for !

656
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,260
Just say it !

657
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,300
You were wrong.

658
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,300
You want me to change the past ?

659
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,940
What happened happened.

660
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,310
Well, it happened to me.

661
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,900
Looked up Rolls-Royce registrations
in '63. Two hits.

662
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,530
One in a car museum

663
00:33:01,531 --> 00:33:04,231
and one owned by an Al Soddenheim.
Guess where he lives.

664
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,710
Chestnut Hill.

665
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,560
Let's take a ride.

666
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,880
Al Soddenheim ?

667
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,440
May I help you ?

668
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,870
I'll be damned.

669
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,280
Baltimore Red lives
in Chestnut Hill.

670
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,840
Drink ?

671
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,490
On the job.

672
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,040
I never let that stop me.

673
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,430
You know why we're here, Red ?

674
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,770
Well, let's see.

675
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,910
Two homicide cops,

676
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,750
an unsolved murder
from 40 years ago.

677
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,430
I was a betting man I'd say it
has to do with Patrick Lennox.

678
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,410
We know you picked him up at the
Broad Street Motel in your Rolls-Royce.

679
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,290
That was my driver.

680
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,020
- Lennox was coming here to play.
- Why didn't you play at Whitey's ?

681
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,920
Well, once the word
of the match got out,

682
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:51,621
Whitey could've hung up
a sign saying "Raids Wanted."

683
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,440
So, what happened ?

684
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:57,590
Lennox give the great Baltimore
Red more than he could handle ?

685
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,270
I can tell you one thing
about Patrick Lennox.

686
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,060
He had some tricks up his sleeve.

687
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,960
- Thirsty ?
- Nah. Let's just shoot.

688
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,210
One game.

689
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,280
2,000.

690
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,720
Standard eight-ball.

691
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,170
That's a nice shot.

692
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,550
Double or nothing ?

693
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:35,090
You know, I must say,

694
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,591
never seen a man up 40,000
look so damn mad.

695
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,130
Kid's right.

696
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,220
Excuse me ?

697
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,480
This ain't no way to live.

698
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,510
What are you doing ?

699
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,410
I'm done.

700
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,210
I didn't call this match.

701
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,810
I won, Red.

702
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,020
I won.

703
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,570
I walk now,

704
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,180
I take 20,000 over the 40
you owe me.

705
00:36:12,581 --> 00:36:14,781
And nobody hears about this.

706
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:21,520
Where do you have to be that's
more important than this ?

707
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,660
Told somebody
I'd take them swimming.

708
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,910
You forgot your cue !

709
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,640
Only cue that ever beat me.

710
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,360
- You set up the match yourself ?
- No, no.

711
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,020
I received a sealed envelope
from Whitey with an anonymous note.

712
00:36:42,021 --> 00:36:43,221
Stake was inside.

713
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,470
What'd it say ?

714
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,390
Oh, something about,uh,

715
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,000
top dog making me look silly.

716
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,570
Bold, but prophetic.

717
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,210
I had my own road partner once.
We took off on his bike,

718
00:36:56,711 --> 00:36:58,411
didn't look back.

719
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,470
Slept where we stopped.

720
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,820
Made whatever coin we could.

721
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,220
The world was our oyster.

722
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,060
It wasn't like that with
me and Patrick ; we were...

723
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,540
Strictly business.
Sure, that's what you said.

724
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,900
But it went deeper than that,
didn't it ?

725
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,750
A bond you develop with
someone on the road.

726
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,100
At least till that kid
came skipping along.

727
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,670
Crazy thing is,

728
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,020
Hillary Rhodes wasn't even his.

729
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,890
What ?

730
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,630
You didn't know ?

731
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,310
Yeah, she was just looking
for a daddy.

732
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,620
Guess the old Rifle was
looking for a kid, too.

733
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:33,390
The question is,where'd
that leave you, Sharon ?

734
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,110
I was done with him anyway.

735
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,610
Say, how'd you describe Patrick again ?

736
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,230
"Top bird at the table ?"

737
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,000
Dog.

738
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,790
Top dog. I feel like
I heard that before.

739
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:51,260
Oh, in the note staking Patrick's match
with Baltimore Red, wasn't it ?

740
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,400
Thought you didn't have
that kind of cash, Sharon.

741
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,860
I didn't. I...

742
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,980
I mean... I didn't write any note.

743
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,490
A lot of money,two grand.

744
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:03,060
Don't know how you got it.
But it couldn't have been easy.

745
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,650
My money ?

746
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,910
You thought if you scored that match for him,
let him see he was top dog for himself,

747
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,820
you could win him back.

748
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,750
- You believed in him.
- I loved him.

749
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,550
Remember a guy named
Larry Sidorski, Sharon?

750
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,050
Told us you hustled him out
of his .32 revolver.

751
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,770
It's the same gun that
killed Patrick, Sharon.

752
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,120
No.

753
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,930
Name's in the theft report.
Got it right here.

754
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,740
I never wanted to hurt him.

755
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,390
But he wanted out.

756
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,860
He was done with the life.

757
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,420
Wanted to be some
sap ham-and-egger.

758
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:53,140
But you couldn't leave
the hustle.

759
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:59,060
There was nothing else for me to do.

760
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,650
Blondie ?

761
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,480
What are you,uh...
what are you doing here?

762
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,700
I've been waiting all night.

763
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,800
Saw you get picked up,
hopped in a cab.

764
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,850
Did you beat him ?

765
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,220
Where's your cue ?
He won your cue ?

766
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,940
I beat him for 40,000.

767
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,610
I knew you were top dog!

768
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,540
I only took 20.

769
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:29,200
Gonna pay my debts,
start clean.

770
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,970
Start clean ? Where you going ?

771
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,870
Back to the motel.

772
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,240
What's at the motel ?

773
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,320
- Hill.
- The kid ?

774
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,510
This ain't no life for her.

775
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,780
What about me ?

776
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,740
I'm tired of checking ticket
stubs to remember where I slept.

777
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,960
But you make fun of all those

778
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:48,561
dull clock-punchers
with nothing to live for.

779
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,500
- The joke's on them.
- The joke's on us.

780
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,330
We're the ones who got nothing.

781
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,600
Okay.

782
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,220
The kid's part of the package.

783
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,680
I can do that. We'll hit the road.

784
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,180
Come on, Blondie. You don't got
a maternal bone in your body.

785
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,180
Look,I'm taking her away,
finding something better.

786
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,300
But you're the Rifle.

787
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,660
Not anymore.

788
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:17,670
Who the hell you think
set up that match ?!

789
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,020
You put up the money ?

790
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,930
How ?

791
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,890
I did what I had to.

792
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,820
Here...

793
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,070
take five thousand.

794
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,160
You're not walking away from this.

795
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,930
Go back and finish the game !

796
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,360
The game's over, Sharon.

797
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,460
<i>As we told you a moment ago,</i>

798
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:26,661
<i>President Kennedy
was assassinated...</i>

799
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,960
Somebody shot him !

800
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,270
I can't believe they shot him!

801
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:35,880
...As his car proceeded through
the crowded streets of Dallas.

802
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:41,100
<i>He died 35 minutes
later in the Dallas...</i>

803
00:41:47,101 --> 00:41:51,101
<i>"My one and only love"
by John Coltrane.</i>

804
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,760
* The very thought of you *

805
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:24,710
* Makes my heart sing *

806
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,740
* Like an April breeze *

807
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,060
* On the wings of spring *

808
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:38,970
* And you appear In all your splendor *

809
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:46,090
* My one and only love. *

810
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:52,470
*********
