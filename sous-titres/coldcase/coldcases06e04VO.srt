1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,100
AUGUST 4, 1978

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,200
All right, everybody.

3
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,300
It's time for a fast... skate!

4
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,900
Ready?

5
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,100
I was born ready.

6
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,400
Good, 'cause today's the day
I'm going to kick your butt.

7
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,700
Why, you been practicing
on the side?

8
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,900
Oh, that's for me to know
and you to find out,

9
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,800
all right.

10
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,000
Hey, so I heard they're trying

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,500
to get roller skating
into the 1980 Olympics.

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Wow, it's about time.

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,900
And if we train
really hard,

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,000
maybe we can make it.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,300
It would be so cool
to win a medal.

16
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,000
Can you imagine being that good?

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Yep.

18
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,600
I'm going to beat you
one of these days.

19
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,800
Oh, dream on.

20
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,700
This is Dawn Whelan.

21
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,600
She claims to have
information

22
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,900
on an old case.

23
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,700
Captain Fashion

24
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,700
says if I tell you what I know,

25
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,800
I get one of those downward

26
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,100
departures.

27
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,600
Well, that's up
to the judge.

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,700
All we can do is listen.

29
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
You made it sound
like a done deal.

30
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,100
Well, tell us
what you got.

31
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,200
If we think it's
worth investigating,

32
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,500
we'll see what we can do.

33
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,800
High school girl was found dead
in Fairmount Park back in '78.

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,000
Missy Gallavan.

35
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,500
All over the news.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You never found the guy
who did it, did you?

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,100
You saw the guy?

38
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,000
No.

39
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,600
But I saw the van
she was getting in.

40
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,700
- In the park?
- No.

41
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,200
Outside a roller rink
in Mayfair.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,600
One of those
customized vans,

43
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,700
had a picture
painted on the side

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,900
What kind of picture?

45
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,600
A spaceship.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,500
You see little green men, too?

47
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,700
I know what I saw.

48
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
- What color was the van?
- Black.

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,100
- What were you doing outside the rink? 
- Smoking a little herbal remedy.

50
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,200
And did you know Missy?

51
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
I'd seen her
around the rink.

52
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,300
Girl could skate.

53
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,100
But you didn't say
anything in '78.

54
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,500
My jackass boyfriend
boosted a car the next night.

55
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,000
We hightailed it
to Florida.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,500
Got the "gimme"s
in a bunch of liquor stores.

57
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,500
Just couldn't say no
to old Captain Morgan.

58
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,300
- Hmm.
- What they got you for now?

59
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,500
Armed robbery.

60
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,600
Looking at ten to 12.

61
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,200
But what I told you,
that's got to be worth

62
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,600
something, right?

63
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,300
We'll let you know.

64
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,300
That's it?

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,600
I got to go back to lockup?

66
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
That girl's family's
been in the dark for 30 years

67
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
while you sat
on that information.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,600
I think you
and Captain Fashion

69
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,500
can sweat a few days

70
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,800
while we check
if your story holds water.

71
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,500
Okay, Dawn?

75
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,000
Ever go to the roller rink
back in the '70s?

76
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,900
Roller disco back then.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,700
Like a regular club,
just on skates.

78
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,300
I had the ones that
clipped on your sneakers.

79
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,600
I used a key to tighten them.

80
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,500
Outdoor skates.
Old school.

81
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,900
I spent hours patrolling
the neighborhood.

82
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,300
I was more into
the night scene.

83
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,100
Ah, rocking
the leisure suit?

84
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,700
Watch yourself now.

85
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,300
I bet I'm faster.

86
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Trust me, Lil...
different leagues.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,800
Missy Gallavan,
15 years old.

88
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,800
A jogger discovered
her body in a ravine

89
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,900
in Fairmount Park,
near Tacony Creek.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,100
Time of death
around midnight.

91
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,800
Blunt-force trauma to the head,
possibly from a fall.

92
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,200
Abrasions on her knees
and palms,

93
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,000
broken fingernails...

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
They had a series of assaults

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
in the park that summer.

96
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,900
Mother said she was a tomboy,

97
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,700
but it looks like
she went party

98
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,700
- with the wrong guy. 
- You could fill a book with the things

99
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,700
teenage girls
don't tell their mothers.

100
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,000
The mother Simone
was a legal secretary,

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,500
worked until 2:00 a. m.
that night.

102
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,600
Well, Missy had gone
to the rink

103
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
with a girl named
Julie Reed.

104
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,000
They split up
around 10:00,

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
but no one saw her
take off.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,800
That leaves two hours
unaccounted for.

107
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,200
Anything could
have happened.

108
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,300
Blue fibers found on the body.

109
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,700
Looked like carpet.

110
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,600
Could be shag
from the spaceship van?

111
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,200
It was the '70s.

112
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,100
They save the nail clippings?

113
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
It looks like, but no DNA

114
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,600
in '78, so they
couldn't test them.

115
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,000
Hmm. Let's get them
from Evidence,

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,200
send them to the lab.

117
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,800
We got science
on our side now.

118
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,500
My daughter never would
have gone to the park

119
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,700
with some stranger.

120
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,100
Missy wasn't who
they made her out to be.

121
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, we're not here
to judge your daughter,

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,900
Mrs. Gallavan.

123
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,500
I know what the police
and everybody else thought.

124
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,400
Well, we're looking into a
possible new lead on her murder.

125
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,700
Did you or Missy
know anyone

126
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,600
with a customized van?

127
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,900
Why, you think someone

128
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,900
with a van
hurt Missy?

129
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,800
Maybe someone she went to school
with? From the neighborhood?

130
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,600
I didn't really know anybody
in the neiborhood.

131
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,900
After my husband
and I split up,

132
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,500
Missy and I moved
into an apartment

133
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
in Mayfair that summer.

134
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,200
Was Missy's father
in the picture?

135
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,100
He took off for California
with his dental hygienist.

136
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,300
Wanted a "fresh start. "

137
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
I went back to work.

138
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,300
Missy told you she was going
to the rink with a friend?

139
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,100
I trusted my daughter.

140
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,600
Missy knew if she couldn't
get a ride home, she could call

141
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,700
and I'd come
and pick her up.

142
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,300
Did she ever call that night?

143
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,800
It's the first time I let her
go with that Julie.

144
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,200
And look what happened.

145
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,400
Julie Reed?

146
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,000
Missy had met her
a couple of weeks

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,200
before at the
apartment complex.

148
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,500
<i>I should never have let her</i>

149
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,800
get mixed up
with a girl like that.

150
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,000
* Danger in the shape
of something wild *

151
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,600
* Stranger dressed in black *

152
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,800
* She's a hungry child *

153
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,500
I've seen you at the rink.

154
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,700
- You're pretty good.
- Thanks.

155
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,200
- Can you hoot the moon?"
- I'm more of a fast skater.

156
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,100
I could maybe show you
a few things...

157
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
if you wanted.

158
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
Sure.

159
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,200
Once you know
some spins and stuff,

160
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,800
we can go to the rink at night.

161
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,000
The real action
happens after 9:00.

162
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Oh, that's for over 18.

163
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,600
I'm only 15.

164
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,000
They won't let me in.

165
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,100
They will
if you're with me.

166
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,200
I have connections.

167
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,400
You know, you could be

168
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,100
pretty if you wore
a little makeup,

169
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,100
played up your eyes.

170
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh, I'm really bad
with all that.

171
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,800
Lucky for you, I'm an expert.

172
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,200
We're about the same size.

173
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I could lend you clothes.

174
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,700
What's wrong with my clothes?

175
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,200
By the time I'm done,
you won't recognize yourself.

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,300
Julie was, uh... fast.

177
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
A lot of attitude.

178
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,700
She told detectives
she was

179
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,600
at the rink with Missy
before they got split up.

180
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,700
Yeah, that's what she said,
all right.

181
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,900
Some friend
she turned out to be.

182
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,500
<i>Uh-uh, no way.</i>

183
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,300
Last time you hooked me up,

184
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,800
the guy wore flip-flops
and forgot his wallet.

185
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,600
- Onions?
- Sure.

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,600
No, Mom,
I'm not talking to you.

187
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,400
- Cheese?
- Heart attack special.

188
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,900
- Heart attack.
- Okay, okay, fine.

189
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,800
- Thanks, Jake.
- But you're babysitting.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,800
What?

191
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,700
My mother met
some guy at church,

192
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,500
and now I have a date
tomorrow night.

193
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
That a bad thing?

194
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,900
You ever had
a good blind date?

195
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,500
I don't do blind dates.

196
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,000
I like to see
what I'm getting into.

197
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,500
Yeah, me, too.

198
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,000
I talked to a buddy
in Narcotics.

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,700
Most of the guys that
detailed vans in the '70s

200
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,000
are tattoo artists
or T-shirt airbrushers now.

201
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,500
What kind of loser paints
a spaceship on their car?

202
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,000
It was the '70s.

203
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,700
<i>Star Wars,
that Boston album...</i>

204
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,800
Parliament Funkadelic.

205
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,500
Uh-uh, brothers were not
painting spaceships on vans.

206
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,700
Not anymore.

207
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,600
Those guys got your mom
down at church

208
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,400
setting them up
on blind dates now.

209
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,100
See, now, that
was uncalled for.

210
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,800
<i>Pretty isolated up here,</i>

211
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,100
<i>especially at night.</i>

212
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,000
Just that one streetlight
up on the road.

213
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,000
The string of assaults
on the park in '78,

214
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,400
everyone knew not
to come here after dark.

215
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,000
Tell a teenager
not to do something,

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,600
it just makes them
want do it more.

217
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, so say she meets
a guy at the rink.

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,700
They get in his van,
come here for some quality time.

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,500
Things start to heat up...

220
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,400
Or don't get as hot
as he wants it.

221
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,000
She fights back,
and he blows a fuse.

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,700
Tosses her over the edge.

223
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,100
Done and done.

224
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,100
Or she gets out of the car,
starts to run...

225
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,800
It's dark; she can't see
where the pavement ends...

226
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,600
Wham, she hits the wall,
topples over.

227
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,600
Humpty Dumpty.

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,600
One nasty fall.

229
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,700
Yeah. You do any artwork on vans
back in the '70s?

230
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,100
Yeah, right.

231
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,900
I am sure your sunsets

232
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,900
would rock my world, sir,

233
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,300
but I'm only interested
in spaceships.

234
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,600
I talked to 33 guys.

235
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Not jack squat.

236
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh, dudes smoked out
all their brain cells.

237
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,400
Yeah, uh, Rufus?

238
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,300
Uh, you do any artwork
on vans back in the '70s?

239
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,300
Yeah?

240
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,500
Spaceships?

241
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,100
- You're kidding.
- I got to go run an errand.

242
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,400
Hair appointment, right?

243
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,800
You better quit now.

244
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,200
Uh, yeah, Rufus?

245
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,400
How long were you
and Missy friends, Julie?

246
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Uh, just a few weeks
before that night.

247
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
She'd just moved
into the building.

248
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,500
Your idea to go to the rink
that night, adult skate?

249
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,700
I had a lot
of bad ideas back then.

250
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,900
I'm sure you remember 15.

251
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,100
- Is that you? 
- My daughter, Tiffany- can't get enough

252
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,600
of that retro fashion.

253
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,500
Uniforms on, girls!

254
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,400
We leave for practice
in ten minutes!

255
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,200
Run a pretty tight ship.

256
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,200
Idle hands, right?

257
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:17,800
If they're busy,

258
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
- they can't get into trouble. 
- Do you remember

259
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,100
any guys who showed interest
in Missy that night?

260
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,200
 Lots of guys.
She was a cute girl.

261
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Any drove a customized van,
a spaceship painted on the side?

262
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Spaceship. No.

263
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,800
Stoners weren't really my scene.

264
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,300
Well, what was
your scene, Julie?

265
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,400
Anywhere I
could get in.

266
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,000
I knew how to handle myself.

267
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,300
- But it was all still pretty fresh for Missy. 
- How'd you two

268
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,500
- get separated that night?
- Met a cute guy.

269
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,800
Got distracted.

270
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,700
I know her mother still
blames me for what happened.

271
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,900
Truth is, I was the kind of girl

272
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,300
I try to keep
my daughters away from.

273
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,300
It's amazing.

274
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,200
Totally different
than daytime.

275
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
Daytime's for kids.

276
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,300
You want a man,
not a boy, right?

277
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,300
I'm... not really sure

278
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,700
- about the whole datinghing.
- Try it.

279
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,900
You'll like it.

280
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,900
I'm still getting used
to my mom dating.

281
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,200
You ever miss your dad?

282
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,500
Not much to miss.

283
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,400
Last time I saw him,

284
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,100
we went to Wanamaker's
to see Santa.

285
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,900
I think I was four.

286
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,600
There's a lot of talent
here tonight.

287
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,600
Now, if a guy grabs your hips

288
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
during "Loco-Motion,"
that means he's into you.

289
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,100
- Okay.
- And if he asks

290
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,100
what you do, just say,
"Taking some classes. "

291
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
It makes you sound older,
ananit's sort of true.

292
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,900
Smart!

293
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,200
I know, right?

294
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,000
And don't worry
if you get nervous

295
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,800
or run out of things to say.

296
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,300
Just flip your hair.
Guys think it's sexy.

297
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,800
Like this?

298
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,200
Perfect.

299
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,400
* I know you'll get to like it
if you give it a chance now *

300
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,900
<i>* Come on, baby *</i>

301
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,000
<i>* Do the Loco-Motion *</i>

302
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,800
* My little baby sister
can do it with ease *

303
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,700
* It's easier
than learning your ABCs *

304
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,100
* So, come on, come on and do *

305
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,000
* The Loco-Motion with me *

306
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,100
* You've got to swing
your hips now *

307
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,900
* Come on *

308
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,800
* Jump up *

309
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
<i>* Jump up *</i>

310
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,700
* Jump back *

311
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,300
<i>* Jump back... *</i>

312
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,800
Summer night,
just out looking for fun.

313
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,500
Turned out to be the worst night

314
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,700
- of my life.
 - Who was the guy getting handsy

315
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,000
- with Missy?
- Rick, the DJ.

316
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,600
He was, like,
a local celebrity.

317
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,700
We were friends.

318
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,000
DJ's friends
with 15-year-old girls?

319
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,600
He would get us
into the over-18,

320
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,100
let us hang out
in his booth.

321
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,000
- He was harmless.
- Rick's DJ booth.

322
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
Shag carpet?

323
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,400
It was the '70's. What else?

324
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,700
Tragic what happened
to that girl.

325
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,200
- I heard she was some skater.
- You remember letting her

326
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,300
- into the adult skate, Rick?
- Hey, the outfits

327
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,500
those girls wore, they could
go wherever they wanted.

328
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,700
That why you decided to do
the"Loco-Motion" with her?

329
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,300
I was the DJ.
I always came out

330
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,900
and grabbed a body
for that song.

331
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,800
Never heard
a lady complain.

332
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,600
The way I heard it,
you had your share

333
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,700
of underage groupies doing
time in your DJ booth.

334
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,800
- They all looked 18 to me.
- A player like you,

335
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,500
I bet you had
a sweet ride back then.

336
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,600
Maybe a cool,
customized van?

337
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,900
No. I was an AMX man.

338
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,100
It was a fast ride, and
the seats fully reclined.

339
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,000
What time did you
leave the rink?

340
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,400
I didn't; I stayed there all
night with some friends, partying.

341
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,000
These friends
gonna back that up?

342
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,100
Yeah, it may take a while,

343
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,000
but I can probably
track 'em down.

344
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,300
How about you toss me
your digits and I'll call you

345
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,100
- with their info? 
- Well, how about you give me their names

346
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,700
and leave
the detective work to me?

347
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,800
Sure you never gave Missy
a spin in your booth?

348
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,000
Come on. There
were so many girls

349
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,400
back then, I lost count.

350
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,700
Oh, let me refresh
your memory.

351
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,200
You skated with her,

352
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,100
and she wound up dead
a few hours later.

353
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,000
Whoa.

354
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
I'm a lover, not a killer, baby.

355
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,300
Yeah.

356
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,700
Look, she was cute.

357
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,400
I might have grabbed her.

358
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,100
But this girl had someone else
on her tail that night.

359
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,200
What's your sign?

360
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,500
Um, Pisces.

361
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,500
You are one foxy
little fish.

362
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,000
What the hell, man?

363
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,800
Watch your hands, man.

364
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,900
You touch me again, and I'll
rearrange your face, kid.

365
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,300
Hey, what are you doing here?

366
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,600
I called your house.

367
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,900
Some guy said
you'd be here.

368
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,500
What are you wearing?

369
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,000
Your face
is all shiny.

370
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,100
It's glitter makeup.

371
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,900
Brings out my eyes.

372
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,600
Look, Missy,
you shouldn't be here.

373
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,900
The guys are all pervy and old.

374
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,600
Anyway, where have you been?

375
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,000
You haven't come
to Fast Skate in weeks.

376
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,900
Julie's been teaching me
some new tricks.

377
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,000
- I can shoot the moon.
- Shoot the moon?

378
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,900
What about the Olympics,
huh, or are you

379
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,400
too cool for that now?

380
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Just...

381
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,700
leave me alone, Hugh, would you?

382
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,700
* 'Cause the music got you
out on the floor *

383
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,700
* We're gonna dance
all night... *

384
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,800
Sure, I could have
taken the guy,

385
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,700
but he seemed jacked
on something.

386
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,500
Did you see him with Missy
later that night?

387
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,300
No, but then again, I wasn't
exactly keeping tabs on her.

388
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,700
I don't need
those reindeer games.

389
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,300
- Of course not. You were king of the rink, huh? 
- You know it.

390
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
We do a '70s night here
on Saturdays.

391
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,400
It's off the hook.

392
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,500
You should
come by.

393
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,900
Give you
the special VIP treatment.

394
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,400
So I go down to Evidence

395
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,100
to pick up
Missy's nail clippings.

396
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Mr. Happy Meal behind the
counter keeps stonewalling,

397
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,600
finding reasons why
I can't have them.

398
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
I know that guy.
Loves to talk.

399
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
We go in circles
for an hour.

400
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,700
Finally, he admits the box

401
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,200
holding them-
get this-

402
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,100
fourows back.

403
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,700
Well, hey, that's gotta
be ten, 12 feet.

404
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh, he's not going to waddle
his fast food self

405
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
all that way.

406
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,100
Afraid the Hamburglar
will grab him.

407
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,800
Unbelievable.

408
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,100
Finally went and got ???

409
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,300
We locate that other kid
from the rink yet?

410
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,800
Hugh Mastersen.

411
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,100
Grew up in her old neighborhood.

412
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,800
I can't decide whether this
guy's creepy or just plain sad.

413
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,400
Pulled up his MySpace page.

414
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,600
Single male in his 40s,
never married.

415
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,800
Still looking
for that "special connection. "

416
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,500
Cross-check him
with vehicle registration?

417
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,700
I don't even think he had
a learner's permit back in '78,

418
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,600
but he did call the house
that night

419
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,000
asking for Missy;
some guy answered,

420
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
said she was
at the rink.

421
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The mother aware of this?

422
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,400
Got a call in to Simone.

423
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Going through
old statements, boyfriends.

424
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,700
If there's a man with a van,
we'll find him.

425
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,700
Any progress
on those nail clippings?

426
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,500
At the lab now,
being tested for DNA.

427
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,700
Will put a hurtin'
on Mr. Happy Meal.

428
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,400
TATTOO

429
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,200
Hey.

430
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,800
Get your nails
done, killer?

431
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,000
Shut up.

432
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,200
So, where are you kids
headed tonight

433
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,900
Think I'm
gonna cancel.

434
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,600
The regular dating's
hard enough.

435
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,700
For a single mom,
it's impossible.

436
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah... why bother?

437
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,100
Get yourself some sweatpants
and park it on the couch.

438
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,500
You make it sound so bad.

439
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,900
Oh, you'll go toe-to-toe
with some jacked-up gangbanger,

440
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,400
but you're afraid
of a little blind date

441
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,800
your mom's met
at church?

442
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,900
Sorry about that. Cat told me
to ink his girl's name

443
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,200
across his back:
Sheryl with an "S."

444
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,000
Turns out

445
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,100
she spells it with a "C".

446
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,500
Well, talk
spaceships, Rufus.

447
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,800
Said on the phone you
remember spraying one

448
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,700
- on a van back in the day?
- Yeah, cat was a big Boston fan

449
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,400
Thought they were gonna
be the next Stones.

450
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,900
So much for his crystal-balling.

451
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,300
I keep my old stuff
in here

452
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,100
for inspiration.

453
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,500
You remember the guy's name?

454
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,200
Just called him Boston.

455
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
You got great skin.

456
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,800
Make an
excellent canvas.

457
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,600
Yeah, here it is.

458
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,300
Huh.

459
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,000
Thanks, Rufus.

460
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,100
We'll try to get
this back to you.

461
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,400
Are we good?

462
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Yeah, we're good.

463
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,100
Yeah, Missy and I grew up
on the same block.

464
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
We were skate buddies
since kindergarten.

465
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,300
Oh, sounds like you two
had a real connection.

466
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,600
The Missy I knew
was a tomboy.

467
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,600
She used to talk about
training for the Olympics.

468
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,000
The guy who answered
the phone

469
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
at Missy's place

470
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
told you she was at the rink?

471
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,800
Did you recognize his voice?

472
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,000
Figured it was
her mom's boyfriend.

473
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,100
Did it occur to you
to mention that

474
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,500
to the police
in '78?

475
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,700
Well, the papers said
some creep picked her up

476
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,200
in the park, but I take it

477
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,600
you already
know that.

478
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,900
Saw your MySpace page, Hugh.

479
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,700
Still looking

480
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,500
for that special connection?

481
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,200
Who isn't?

482
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,500
Well, you seemed
pretty particular to Missy

483
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,100
- back in the day.
- I told you we were friends.

484
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,500
Going after her and the guy
she's with isn't really

485
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,900
friend behavior,
is it?

486
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,800
That DJ was a creep.

487
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,600
No argument here,
but you were angry with her.

488
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,500
I wasn't mad at her.

489
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
I was worried about her.

490
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,800
Funny way of showing it.

491
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,900
When Missy moved away,
she just fell off the map.

492
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,800
When I finally see her again,
the way she looked...

493
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,700
it just wasn't her.

494
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,600
- Hey.
- Hey.

495
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,200
Um... look, I'm...

496
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm really sorry
about before.

497
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I- I haven't heard from you
since you moved.

498
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I was gonna call
you, but...

499
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,000
things have been
kind of messed up.

500
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,100
My mom works

501
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,200
all the time.

502
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
And she's got
this slimy boyfriend.

503
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,300
He's always around.

504
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,700
This guy...

505
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,400
did he do something?

506
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,100
Missy, it's me.

507
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,900
I mean, you can
tell me anything.

508
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
The other night...

509
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,600
we were watching TV,

510
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,700
and he...

511
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,700
he touched my hair.

512
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,000
It creeped me out.

513
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,800
What are you going
to do about it?

514
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,100
Stay out of his way.

515
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,800
So, what have you been doing
all summer?

516
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,400
Well, found this new place.

517
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,400
You're gonna love it.

518
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,900
We can go now

519
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,400
if you want to,
on my bike.

520
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,100
Tear it up like we used to.

521
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,500
I promised Julie
I'd do the dance contest

522
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,600
with her later.

523
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,500
But I can come by your house
tomorrow.

524
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,100
We'll start training then.

525
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,300
Okay.

526
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,600
I waited on my front steps
all day,

527
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,900
but she just never showed.

528
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,100
What'd you do
after you left Missy?

529
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,700
Rode my bike home;
I had to get up at 5:00

530
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,500
in the morning
for my paper route.

531
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,300
Pretty much quit skating
after that

532
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
It just wasn't the same
without Missy.

533
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,900
<i>Plates from the van</i>

534
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,600
came back registered
to a Joe Bosquay.

535
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,700
He got a sheet?

536
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,600
That name, Bosquay...

537
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,700
In '91,

538
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,600
his 16-year-old stepdaughter
charged him with sexual assault.

539
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,300
The charges were dropped, but...

540
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,400
Where there's smoke...

541
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,400
And Joe Bosquay
alibi'd out in '78.

542
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,900
Jacuzzi salesman,
dated the mother.

543
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,100
Simone's boyfriend.

544
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,700
Well, Simone backed him up,
said he wasn't around.

545
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,600
Yeah, well, we got 30 years
of history since then

546
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,800
not backing Joe up.

547
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,100
Now, according
to Hugh,

548
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
the guy was putting the moves
on Missy a few days

549
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,400
- before she died.
- Bring him in?

550
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,700
The mother, too.
Maybe she knows more

551
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,000
than she's been letting on.

552
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,700
Homicide. Stillman.

553
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,000
Just a minute.

554
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,700
It's Miller...

555
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,200
and she's pretending
to be someone else.

556
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,300
She sounds drunk.

557
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,200
Miller? You sure?

558
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,000
She's asking for you, Scotty.

559
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,500
Get in, lush.

560
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,300
I would've called a cab,
but I was late,

561
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,100
left the house
without my wallet.

562
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,400
So, what's wrong with the guy?

563
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Nothing.

564
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Good-looking,

565
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,500
manners, ordered
a nice bottle of wine.

566
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,700
I just drank half of it
before the calamari came.

567
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,800
Ah, you were nervous.

568
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
It's a rookie mistake.

569
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,200
I don't have the time
or energy for the game.

570
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,900
Bring on the sweatpants.

571
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,600
You, you say
good-bye to him,

572
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,100
or just go to the bathroom,
never come back?

573
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,100
Oh, that's cold, man.

574
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,100
You got to call
him tomorrow.

575
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,600
Make up some kind
of work emergency.

576
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,200
Hmm-mm, I'm not calling him.

577
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,900
This was a one-shot deal.
One and done.

578
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,400
Aw, come on, Kat.

579
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
You got to get
back in the game.

580
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
Got no game, baby.

581
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,200
- Game over.
- It's a shame.

582
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,000
You're still a
pretty good catch.

583
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,500
- Yeah?
- Just saying.

584
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,900
You deserve more.

585
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,200
Damn straight.

586
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,100
Lousy-ass cop, though.

587
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,700
Take me home before
I puke all over your car.

588
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,400
You got it.

589
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,400
<i>Joe Bosquay...</i>

590
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,000
That's a name I'd rather forget.

591
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,700
But he was
your boyfriend?

592
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Not for long.

593
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,500
He was just the
first guy to look at me

594
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,100
after my husband left.

595
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,900
Turns out I wasn't a very good
judge of character.

596
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,900
You didn't tell us
he drove a van.

597
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,500
Big spaceship on it.

598
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,900
He didn't drive a van.

599
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,100
He drove a convertible.

600
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,300
You sure about that?

601
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,600
He kept the top down
all the time.

602
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,800
I had to wear a scarf to keep
my hair from blowing around.

603
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,300
The van was registered
to Joe's business.

604
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,300
I've never seen it before.

605
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,300
Why?

606
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,500
Was Joe ever home
when you weren't?

607
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,600
No.

608
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,800
Not that I know of.

609
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,600
Did he have a key
to your apartment?

610
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,300
No.

611
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,200
Ever keep an extra key

612
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
outside your door,
maybe for Missy?

613
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,200
Oh, my God.

614
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,500
You don't think...

615
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,500
You ever been
arrested, Joe?

616
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,400
Nope.

617
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,900
My record's clean.

618
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,700
Only 'cause your
stepdaughter Celeste

619
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,400
didn't proceed with her case
against you.

620
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,700
Bitch was a liar.

621
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,700
It was his van.

622
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,400
And Joe picked up Missy
at the rink.

623
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,500
No, no, no,
th-that's not possible.

624
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,600
I- I would have known.

625
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,900
We have an eyewitness, Simone.

626
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,700
God, I brought that man
into my house.

627
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,000
DA said Celeste's mother
pressured her to walk away.

628
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,200
You had her convinced

629
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,000
you were some kind
of Prince Charming.

630
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,600
So much for maternal instinct.

631
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,400
Fibers found on

632
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,500
Missy's body came back
from the lab.

633
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,300
American Blue shag.

634
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,300
One of the
options offered

635
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,200
on the '76 Chevy Van 20.

636
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,900
Perfect match
for your model van.

637
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,400
I never touched Missy.

638
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,900
Missy ever try to talk
to you about Joe?

639
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,800
She... she...

640
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,200
told me something once.

641
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,900
A- a day or two
before she died, but...

642
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,100
But what, Simone?

643
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
I thought it was
about something else.

644
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,600
Look! It's called
"Shoot the moon. "

645
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,300
That's terrific!

646
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,400
Oh, you should come to the rink
with me sometime.

647
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,300
We'd have so much fun.

648
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,500
Maybe Joe could come, too.

649
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,900
He's a great dancer.

650
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,800
I bet he's a great
skater, too.

651
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,900
Do you think
Joe really loves you?

652
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,000
The way you and Dad
loved each other...

653
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
before?

654
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,600
Oh, honey.

655
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,300
Your dad-
he's not coming back.

656
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,100
I know that.

657
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,700
You've had a lot to
adjust to this summer.

658
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,800
You have been
such a trooper.

659
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,500
But you and me...

660
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,100
we're a family.

661
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,700
We don't need anyone else.

662
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,400
Right?

663
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,800
Nobody will ever
replace your dad.

664
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,900
But whoever it is

665
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,700
I'm dating,
you have to give him a chance.

666
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,200
I know, and I did, but
Joe's not the guy for you, Mom.

667
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,100
You are too picky, honey.

668
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,200
Maybe you're not picky enough.

669
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,200
I just thought
she missed her father.

670
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,300
She was trying
not to hurt your feelings.

671
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,000
It's all my fault.

672
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,900
That bastard!

673
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,200
You were in the apartment
that night.

674
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,700
- You answered the phone.
- So?

675
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,100
Missy wanted a ride home.

676
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,600
Which you never told her mother
or the cops back then?

677
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,000
The kid ended up dead
that night.

678
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,500
It would have looked bad.

679
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,100
Because it was bad!

680
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,200
You picked her up
at the rink,

681
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,000
took her to the park!

682
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,500
No!
She never went anywhere with me.

683
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
* Got a surprise
especially for you *

684
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,200
Where's my mom?

685
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,900
Where'd you get this van?

686
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,000
She's still at work.

687
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,500
I really need her right now.

688
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,600
Yeah, well... you got me.

689
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,900
* Waited so long,
waited so long *

690
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,800
Come on.

691
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,300
I need your help inside.

692
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
All right.

693
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,100
Julie, wake up.

694
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,600
I brought help. We're going
to get you out of here.

695
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,800
Do you have any idea
how young these girls are?

696
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,400
- This is not cool.
- Look, man, I...

697
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,100
This is not cool at all.

698
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,300
I wouldn't want to be you
if the cops get wind of this.

699
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,900
If somebody gave them
the wrong impression.

700
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Maybe this will
keep you quiet?

701
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,900
Julie can stay
till she sleeps it off?

702
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,600
And we'll all forget
this ever happened.

703
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,900
Forget what?

704
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,200
Let's scram, Missy. We got
places to go and people to see.

705
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,300
- Aren't you going to do something? 
- Let's go.

706
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,800
I'm not leaving Julie alone.

707
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,800
I am not going anywhere
with you.

708
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,500
You're disgusting.

709
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,800
You don't want to come,
that's your deal,

710
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,100
but, uh, I don't think your mom
is gonna to be too thrilled

711
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,000
at how you're spending
your time.

712
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,800
I guess now
you and I have a secret.

713
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,300
They were Rick's problem
after that.

714
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,600
I mean, I didn't need
that kind of headache.

715
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,400
Where did you go
after you left the rink?

716
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,100
I went to my friend Anita's.

717
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,100
That, uh, lady loved her
some nose candy.

718
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,400
It made her real grateful.

719
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:48,900
More grateful

720
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,000
than Simone?

721
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,000
Simone wasn't around.

722
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,100
A man has needs.

723
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,600
I'm torn, Joe.

724
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,600
I can't decide if you're too old
for me to feed you your teeth.

725
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,000
Mrs. Gallavan.

726
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,400
You were supplying drugs
to minors.

727
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,000
Trying to get over
on underage girls.

728
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,600
- I didn't...
- You lied, Rick.

729
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,900
You did see Missy again
that night.

730
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,000
Her friend Julie was high
as a kite, thanks to you.

731
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,700
So you made sure
Missy stayed silent.

732
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Whoa!

733
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,100
The last time I saw those girls,
they were very much alive.

734
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,400
She's freezing, Rick.

735
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,800
She needs a doctor!

736
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,600
Rick, what's going on?

737
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,600
Your friend
brought her old man.

738
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,700
That's what's going on.

739
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,400
I want you two brats out now!

740
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,400
Don't even think
about coming back.

741
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,700
I didn't kill that girl.

742
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,400
I just wanted her to take
her friend and go home!

743
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,900
You saying Missy left
with Julie?

744
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,700
Gave her
that roller-skating jacket.

745
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,200
She was cleaning up my mess.

746
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,600
Guess I owe her a thanks.

747
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,800
Sure you're done
jerking us around, Rick?

748
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
- Nothing else?
- That's all I got.

749
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,000
Talk to Julie.

750
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,400
Good. We will.

751
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,300
What the hell?

752
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,100
You got six
outstanding tickets

753
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,200
for moving violations
in Potter County.

754
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,000
Tickets?

755
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Well, 1,400 bucks ain't no joke.

756
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,600
Potter County PD's on their way
downstate to pick you up.

757
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,800
Long drive.

758
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,800
Could take all night.

759
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,600
See if we can find
a nice big cellmate

760
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,100
you can
"do the Loco-Motion" with.

761
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,500
Who's the foxy fish now?

762
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,400
??? for a while.

763
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,200
- Should be about ready to talk now. 
- Mm-hmm.

764
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,500
Tell her you'd
be right there?

765
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,700
Yup, about an hour ago.

766
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,600
Nice.

767
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,000
So, you call him?

768
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,800
What are you now,
my life coach?

769
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,400
Apparently,
I'm your driver.

770
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,100
Never living that down.

771
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,200
Call him.

772
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,600
Why am I here?

773
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,800
I told you
everything I knew

774
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,700
when you were at my house.

775
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,100
Except the part
about you going home

776
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,500
with Missy that night.

777
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,600
Who told you that?

778
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,900
Your good buddy,
Rick, the DJ.

779
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,000
The cute guy you hooked up
with that night.

780
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,200
He didn't think
you were so cute

781
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,800
after you passed out

782
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,200
on his couch, though.

783
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,000
He gave me some pills.

784
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,500
I barely remember that night.

785
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,200
You remember how Missy

786
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,600
got your sorry butt
out of there.

787
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,700
No, I blacked out.

788
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,800
Yeah, that's bull.

789
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,900
She had your back.

790
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,700
Put her jacket on you,
took you home.

791
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,400
Same jacket you kept
all these years.

792
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,500
Let your daughter wear it.

793
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,400
Why is that, Julie?

794
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,500
Tiffany found it in the attic.

795
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,400
I didn't know it was there.

796
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,900
You kept it for a reason.

797
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,200
Couldn't bring yourself
to get rid of it.

798
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,000
Something happened
between you two,

799
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,400
at the rink or on the way home.

800
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,800
What was it, Julie?

801
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,200
For all my talk,

802
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,200
I was still a virgin when
I went to the rink that night.

803
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,700
When I got home,
I realized I wasn't anymore.

804
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,600
It was Rick?

805
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,500
I remember messing around,

806
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,900
and then things got fuzzy.

807
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Next thing I knew,
Missy was there,

808
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,900
and he was kicking us out.

809
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,900
She came back

810
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,400
for you, Julie.

811
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You owe it to her now
to tell the truth.

812
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,500
All she did was help me.

813
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,900
And I was terrible to her.

814
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,900
What happened, Julie?

815
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,500
If I'd been a better friend,
she would still be alive today.

816
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
Do you still feel sick?

817
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,800
Don't even talk to me.

818
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
You're mad at me?

819
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,600
I invited you into my
world and you blew it.

820
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,200
You've ruined everything!

821
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,300
I was just trying
to help...

822
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,500
Well, you didn't.

823
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,800
Rick was going
to be my boyfriend,

824
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,900
and now he'll never
speak to me again.

825
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,800
Were you guys...

826
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,700
Duh.

827
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,400
How else do you think
I got into the over-18?

828
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,600
It's not because I'm
such a great skater.

829
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,000
He's a jerk.

830
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,600
You'll find somebody cooler.

831
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,200
Someone our age.

832
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,900
Boys our age are idiots.

833
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,900
And older guys aren't?

834
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,400
I had kind of a fight
with my mom's boyfriend.

835
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,200
Can I sleep over
your house tonight?

836
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,400
After what you did?

837
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,700
I never want to speak
to you again.

838
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,900
But I don't have
any place to go.

839
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,200
That's your problem,

840
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,200
not mine.

841
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,800
That's the last time I saw her.

842
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
That whistle...

843
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,300
someone she knew?

844
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,000
I didn't look back to see.

845
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,000
I'll never forgive myself.

846
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,700
All this time we've been looking
for a guy in a van

847
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,800
who took Missy
to the park that night.

848
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,400
Didn't think too much
about a boy on a bike.

849
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,600
It's tough when you're 15.

850
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,700
All the girls move on
to older guys.

851
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,400
All of a sudden,

852
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,200
you're just a squeaky-voiced
little kid with a paper route.

853
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,900
That what Missy thought of you?

854
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,200
Missy wasn't like that.

855
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,300
How come you never
married, Hugh?

856
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,200
Just never found the right girl?

857
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,100
Or maybe you did.

858
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,600
Only she just wasn't
that into you.

859
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,200
We were just friends.

860
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,400
But you wanted it
to be more.

861
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,300
No, it wasn't like that.

862
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,900
It's always that way
with guys, Hugh.

863
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,300
That's why you
came back for her.

864
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,400
You whistled to her,

865
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,100
to let her know

866
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:06,900
you were there.

867
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,100
Just like you always did
when you were kids.

868
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,900
Only she wasn't

869
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,300
interested anymore.

870
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,900
And you'd come so far,
put in all that time.

871
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,300
Only Missy was
a fighter.

872
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,400
What?
No, no, you got it all wrong.

873
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,600
No, we don't.

874
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,200
We got your skin under her
fingernail clippings, Hugh.

875
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,200
And your DNA on that can

876
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,100
to prove it.

877
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,700
It was all my fault.

878
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,300
What was your fault, Hugh?

879
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,600
I didn't...

880
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,000
I didn't know what she wanted.

881
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,000
See I didn't,
I didn't realize...

882
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,400
All she really needed
was a friend.

883
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,700
I just let it
get all turned around.

884
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,000
Oh, I can't believe
you brought an extra pair.

885
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,600
They're my old ones,
but, uh, they're adjustable.

886
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,600
Figured they'd come
in handy someday.

887
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm out of practice,
but I bet I can still take you.

888
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,200
Yeah, we'll see.

889
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,500
Missy!

890
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,600
You okay?

891
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Yeah, I'm great.

892
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,400
Never felt better.

893
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,400
Well, if it wasn't
for this bum wheel,

894
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,900
I totally would
have aced you.

895
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,600
Oh, but my hair got caught
on my lip gloss, slowed me down.

896
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,800
Tomorrow I'll be dressed
right...

897
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,300
whole other race.

898
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,100
Yeah, so you say.

899
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,600
Oh...

900
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,800
Tonight really sucked.

901
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,800
But this...

902
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,200
now...

903
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,100
it kind of makes it all okay.

904
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,000
What are you doing?

905
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,500
- No, no, I-I just...
- And I thought we were friends.

906
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,600
I thought I could trust you.

907
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,100
Well, no, no.
You, you, you can trust me.

908
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,700
I thought that...

909
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,500
After everything
that's happened today,

910
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,000
I can't believe you!

911
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,600
Missy, Missy, I'm sorry...

912
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,000
Missy, please!

913
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,500
Look, we can go back to the way
things used to be, okay?

914
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,000
Forget it ever
happened, okay?

915
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
- We can go back to the way things were! 
- Get off me!

916
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,200
Missy, no!

917
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,700
Missy...

918
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,200
Missy...

919
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,600
* You are here and warm *

920
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:01,600
* But I could look away
and you'd be gone *

921
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,200
* 'Cause we live in a time *

922
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,600
* When meaning falls
in splinters from our lives *

923
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,400
* And that's why
I've traveled far *

924
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,900
* 'Cause I come so together
where you are *

925
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,800
* Yes, and all of the things
that I said that I wanted *

926
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,100
ACCIDENTAL DEATH
* Come rushing by in my head
when I'm with you *

927
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,500
ACCIDENTAL DEATH
* Fourteen joys
and a will to be merry *

928
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,000
* All of the things
that we say are very *

929
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,500
CLOSED
* Sentimental gentle wind,
blowing through my life again *

930
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,400
* Sentimental lady, gentle one *

931
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,000
* All I need is you *

932
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,700
* Sentimental gentle wind,
blowing through my life again *

933

* Sentimental lady, gentle one *

934
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:27,100
* Ooh, sentimental lady *

935
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
* Yes, and all of the things
