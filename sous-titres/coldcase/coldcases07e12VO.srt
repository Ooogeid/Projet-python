00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,330
May 3, 1974

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,330
Mrs. Welter, sorry
to keep you waiting.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,780
Mr. Denton,

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,581
I'd like the results
of your investigation.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,820
What is that you have on,
Mrs. Welter ?

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,310
It's intoxicating.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,860
Moonlit Mist.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,410
Stalling, Mr. Denton.

11
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,711
I don't like it when men
keep me waiting.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,460
Then let's get down to business.

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,410
The good news, Mrs. Welter,

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,930
is that your husband Carl is rich.

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,090
the bad news is,
he's banging the secretary

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,700
Myrtle Bartlett, hot little number.

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,340
Wednesdays and thursdays.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,850
Room at the Capricorn motel,

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,230
lunch at the regent.
Then took her shopping.

20
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,320
Bought her several undergarments
at Macy's

21
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:52,121
and a bottle of perfume...

22
00:00:52,522 --> 00:00:54,022
Moonlit Mist.

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,370
Here, let me see.

24
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,920
Upside down.

25
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,490
Reminds me of a chinese
circus I saw once.

26
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,640
I'm glad you find
this funny, Mr. Denton.

27
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,840
Flexible son of a bitch though,
ain't he ?

28
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,950
Oh, Lana, sweetheart, come here
and let me see your shoes.

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,190
You've seen them already.

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,280
Twice.

31
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,690
Hey, hey, that's my medicine.

32
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,870
Wilson Katz is here.

33
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,480
I told him you need a minute.

34
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,400
For what ?

35
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,300
We can't have you looking like
you've been in a bar fight.

36
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,210
I don't suppose Mrs. Welter
paid her bill ?

37
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,170
No.

38
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,030
I'm sick of taking
these penny-ante cases.

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,860
Maybe Katz has got a big job.

40
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,740
Probably just scraps, but...

41
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,680
All right, go ahead.

42
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,500
Let the bald bastard in.

43
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,530
What do you got ?

44
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,620
Workers uncovered the
bones this morning.

45
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,410
male.

46
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,860
CSU estimates late 30s.

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,060
Site engineer thinks the body was
there when the foundation was poured.

48
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,890
Contacted LNI to get a date
on the original build permit.

49
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,230
Unlucky worker or union scab.

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,910
Well, carrying a gun,
not a hammer.

51
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,490
Techs recovered it with the body.
It's a .32.

52
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,580
Murder weapon ?

53
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,660
Not likely. Found in
a holster on the body.

54
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,900
They got a hit
on the serial numbers.

55
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,580
It's registered to a Harold Denton.

56
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,240
Harry Denton.

57
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,360
Ring a bell ?

58
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,320
Ex-vice cop.

59
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,590
Took a swing at his captain.

60
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,480
One of us ?

61
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,710
No, they washed him out,

62
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:13,811
and Harry went over to the dark side
and became a private investigator.

63
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,980
Ah, it's bunch of scumbags.

64
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,390
creeping around the bushes,

65
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:20,291
snapping shots of cheating
husbands and wives.

66
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,570
They're not all bad.

67
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,050
I had one do me a solid on a
rape case

68
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:24,051
a couple years back.

69
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,350
These guys are all the same.

70
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,480
They're thinking they're solving
mysteries

71
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:28,081
like Sam Spade.

72
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,300
That Harry's game ?

73
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,470
Ii got a buddy in vice
who will remember him.

74
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,410
Probably just taking cases
to get by.

75
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,280
Looks like Harry took the wrong case.

76
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,040

The runaway Bunny

79
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,370
Harry Denton, 40 years old.

80
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,590
M.E. says the dental
records are a match.

81
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,050
Well, missing persons report
filed may 11, 1974,

82
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:27,451
by Harry's secretary,
Lana Parker.

83
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,000
Reported the safe in Harry's
office had been cleaned out.

84
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,720
A list of Harry's last appointments,
so that's about it.

85
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,720
Assigned really punched
the clock on this one.

86
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,280
Harry burned some bridges
around here.

87
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,550
You talk to IAB ?

88
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,420
Odd.

89
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,250
There's no mention of Harry
hitting his captain.

90
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,980
Got drummed out for taking
the note.

91
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,160
Harry was dirty ?

92
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,430
Yeah, booted off the force in '71.

93
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:48,031
Started up "Denton investigations"
right after.

94
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,410
Different times back then.

95
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,040
The way I heard it,
a lot of cops on the take.

96
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,350
Didn't stop with Dacron and disco.

97
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,850
Recovered a .38 caliber bullet
embedded in the breast bone,

98
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:01,151
suggesting a posterior
point of entry.

99
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,340
Shot in the back.

100
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,810
Probably running from something.

101
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,000
What do you got, Nick ?

102
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,240
Spent a riveting hour down at the
licensing and inspection office.

103
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,480
HBT construction did
the cement work may 8.

104
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,150
How about a list of company
employees ?

105
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,100
Besides the name,
I got a bunch of nothing.

106
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,930
The outfit went belly up in the '80s.

107
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,200
Got a minute ?

108
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,610
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here, pops.

109
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,950
You should have called
before you came down.

110
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,120
You find something out ?

111
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,810
What ?

112
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,170
Did ma' say something ?

113
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,370
Didn't have to.

114
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,710
I know when something is up.

115
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,420
Hey, look, pops, it's not
a good time right now.

116
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,930
We'll talk later.

117
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,030
I'll come back.

118
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,910
We'll grab lunch tomorrow.

119
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,900
I promise.

120
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,000
Harry finally turned up.

121
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,140
Yeah, under a three-story
office building

122
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:08,541
and seven tons of concrete.

123
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,680
Shot in the back.

124
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,050
Kept his desk.

125
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,980
Even left his medicine.

126
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,690
Harry was one of the good ones.

127
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,530
You filed the missing person's report ?

128
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,910
A lot of good that did.

129
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,330
Harry was persona non
grata with the Philly P.D.

130
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,120
On account of him getting
kicked off the force ?

131
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,110
Kept telling me without a body
or evidence of foul play,

132
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:28,411
they were going under the assumption
he'd skipped town.

133
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:28,940
Not like Harry ?

134
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,190
Harry wasn't the type
to turn tail.

135
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,410
Trust me, there were times
I wish he had.

136
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,150
You took over Harry's business
after he disappeared ?

137
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,190
That's right.

138
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,440
I knocked off Harry
so I could get rich

139
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,641
taking photos of cheating spouses.

140
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,470
I've seen people kill for less.

141
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,630
Harry could be a real pain in the ass,

142
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:47,731
but his heart was in the right place.

143
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,250
What sort of casework
did Harry specialize in ?

144
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,420
If it had a pulse and a wallet and
walked through that door,

145
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:54,721
we took the job.

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,110
This is a list of the cases
Harry was working on.

147
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,360
Anything we should know about ?

148
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,590
Krebs was a tail job...
went nowhere.

149
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,580
O'Keefe...
a cheating husband.

150
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,990
same as Barb Welter.

151
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,390
What about the one
that says "counselor" ?

152
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,620
Wilson Katz.

153
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,300
Big-shot lawyer.

154
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,500
He and Harry served
in the Navy together.

155
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,040
Harry ever work for him before ?

156
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,690
A little bit of this, a little
bit of that, but always on the QT.

157
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,390
I see business is going well, Harry.

158
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,490
It's nothing.

159
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,450
Oh, silk.

160
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,670
Oh, you must be keeping some
swanky company these days, Wilson.

161
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,700
I remember when you was wearing
plastic shoes

162
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:34,701
and eating at the automat.

163
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,950
Knock it off, Harry.

164
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,240
I'm here about a client.

165
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,330
You know my rates.

166
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,450
This client requires discretion.

167
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,330
To ensure that discretion, the client
is willing to double your rates.

168
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,270
All right, enough
with the cryptic jive, Katz.

169
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,670
Just tell me the job.

170
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,140
Lana, be a sweetheart, go out and
grab us a couple coffees, would you ?

171
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,210
When I came back, they were gone.

172
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,010
Ever find out what the case was ?

173
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,940
I asked, but Harry wouldn't tell me.

174
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,110
Is Katz still around ?

175
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,340
He's still practicing.

176
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,120
Making problems disappear.

177
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,930
For a fee, of course.

178
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,920
Not a fan ?

179
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,150
Know the difference between
a mosquito and a lawyer ?

180
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,410
One's a blood-sucking parasite,

181
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:17,911
the other's an insect.

182
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,540
The season opener's a ways off,
Mr. Katz.

183
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,860
That it is, detective.

184
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,780
How can I help you ?

185
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,620
We're here about your
old friend, Harry Denton.

186
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,560
They found his body buried under
an office building in center city.

187
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,060
I'm not surprised.
Harry kept bad company.

188
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,540
Lawyers included ?

189
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,490
I'm afraid so.

190
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,610
You hired Harry right
before he was killed.

191
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,540
Perhaps.

192
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,930
What was the job ?

193
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,560
I have my client's privacy
to protect.

194
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,750
I bet those fancy clients of yours
would love opening their morning paper,

195
00:08:56,751 --> 00:09:00,151
seeing your name linked
to a murder investigation.

196
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,370
I retained Harry's services
at the behest of a client.

197
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,400
Name ?

198
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,270
Caroline Hargreave.

199
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,830
<i>"Wind, sky, sea and sand"
by Lee Hazlewood.</i>

200
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,060
Some lunk of goldfish, huh ?

201
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,130
Koi, flown in direct from Kyoto.

202
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,510
Don't touch them.

203
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,940
Be a darling, Wilson,
and fetch my robe.

204
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,770
Hell of a view.

205
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,500
Harry Denton, "Denton Investigations".

206
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,940
Wilson says you're good
at finding things.

207
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,610
Depends on what I'm looking for.

208
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,530
Harry's the right man for the job.

209
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,830
I need you to find
my daughter, Mr. Denton.

210
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,070
Her name's Michelle,
but we call her Bunny.

211
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,390
Pretty girl.

212
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,170
Beauty can be a burden.

213
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,110
Runaway ?

214
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,230
Last week.

215
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,010
- It happen before ?
- No.

216
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,230
Helps if I know why
she decided to scram.

217
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,660
Bunny's father Stan
recently passed away.

218
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,130
Heart attack.

219
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,680
Quite a shock.

220
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,230
And Bunny took it hard ?

221
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,450
Adored her father.
She started acting out.

222
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,590
I'd rather not involve
the police again.

223
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,290
Again ?

224
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,580
Last month they picked her
up for reckless driving.

225
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,550
Wilson says you're the discrete type.

226
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,580
You betcha.

227
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,400
Anything else I should know ?

228
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,180
To make a long story short,
I plan on sending her to oakdale,

229
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:34,981
camp for troubled teens.

230
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,210
And Bunny resisted.

231
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,960
We had a terrible fight.
She took a car and ran away.

232
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,430
I'm worried she's in trouble.

233
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,790
What sort of trouble ?

234
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,140
I'm afraid she fell in
with some undesirables.

235
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,040
Bohemians and radicals.

236
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,270
Oh, well, you got to watch
out for those types.

237
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,770
Did a number on Patty Hearst.

238
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,650
That's where you come in,
Mr. Denton.

239
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,910
I want my daughter back safe
and with a minimum of fuss.

240
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,160
I'll start today.

241
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,590
Wilson, see to it that
Mr. Denton gets his money.

242
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,940
But Harry was too late.

243
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,760
He didn't find her ?

244
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,020
Bunny died in a car accident
several days later.

245
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,990
When was this ?

246
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,460
May 6, 1974.

247
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,580
Caroline was heartbroken.

248
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,100
Blamed herself for not acting sooner.

249
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,350
This is Rush from homicide.
Got a possible 10-37.

250
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,130
A DIU suspect driving a dark gray
chevy cobalt,

251
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:00,831
license number 9.

252
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,780
Tracked down the owner of
"HBT Construction", Carl Welter.

253
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,800
HBT was one of a series
of shell companies

254
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:14,201
set up to take advantage
of non-union contracts.

255
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,700
And what's the connect to Harry ?

256
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,160
Welter's wife, Barb, hired Harry
to check up him.

257
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,480
Harry captured a few kodak moments
between Carl and his secretary.

258
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,550
Booked for agg assault in '75.

259
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,300
Settled a dispute with one of his
subcontractors with a piece of rebar.

260
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,680
And Harry gets a concrete coffin.

261
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,440
"HBT Construction".

262
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,170
One of your company's
poured the foundation, Carl.

263
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,280
I'd have to have a date
and an address,

264
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:50,981
and even then,
I can't promise you nothing.

265
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,580
May 8, 1974, 16 north terrace.

266
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,910
Could have been one of ours.

267
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,220
I'm guessing disposing of
bodies is a big code violation.

268
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,510
Oh, I don't know nothing
about that.

269
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,980
Could have been some illegal
that fell asleep on a job ;

270
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:06,281
it wouldn't be the first time.

271
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,790
Man's name was Harry Denton,
private eye.

272
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,550
Did a little work for your wife, Barb.

273
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,450
Okay, so I wanted to wring
his neck. Wouldn't you ?

274
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,950
<i>"Walk away" by James Gang.</i>

275
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,000
You seen her ?

276
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,040
How about you ? Seen her ?

277
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,390
Get off !

278
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,350
Get your hands off me !

279
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,720
Just doing my job, kid.

280
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,840
- That woman is not my mother !
- Get in the...

281
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,780
Get your hands off me !

282
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,490
Get in !

283
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,230
You can't do this !

284
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,420
You son of a bitch !

285
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,550
What is with you people ?

286
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,180
- Say the word, Harry !
- Easy, easy, Frenchie.

287
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,670
Branching out to kidnapping
underage girls, Denton ?

288
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,690
Stray glee-clubber.
What's on your mind, Carl ?

289
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,850
The photos you took are gonna
cost me a bundle.

290
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,500
Well, maybe we can work
sosmething out,

291
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,901
seeing as how your wife
neglected to pay her bill.

292
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,770
What'd you have in mind ?

293
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,640
I see the number 500,

294
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:47,641
and those negatives of you and the steno
doing the motel mambo disappear.

295
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,010
How do I know I can trust you ?

296
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:49,940
Oh, you don't.

297
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,330
My advice ?

298
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,630
patch things up with the missus.

299
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,180
it's cheaper in the long run.

300
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,040
Yeah, I'm starting to see that.

301
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,890
- $400.
- 600

302
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,460
All right, all right, $500.

303
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,550
Frenchie, release Mr. Welter.

304
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,180
Bunny's keys ought to be
in that bag.

305
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,030
Take her to mexico.

306
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,550
A couple of margaritas,
a little nude snorkeling,

307
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:15,551
a tennis bracelet,
she'll forgive you.

308
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,330
The son of a bitch
was right about Mexico.

309
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,340
'course, she ran off with a shoe
salesman a couple of years later.

310
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,420
Describe the girl you saw Harry with.

311
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,630
Blonde, she was real pretty.

312
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,160
She wasn't too happy about
being put in that trunk.

313
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,860
Yeah, that looks like her.

314
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,180
Could have done something
about it.

315
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,930
And have Harry's pet gorilla
twist my head off ?

316
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,780
Remember when this was ?

317
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,880
Let's see.

318
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,510
The wife and I left for

319
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:50,511
Puerto Vallarta the very next day for
cinco de mayo, so it was may 4.

320
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,860
Looks like someone had
a little irish breakfast.

321
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,170
Oh, my.

322
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,650
I hear Moe Kitchener got
picked up for DUI last night.

323
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,690
Imagine that.

324
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,860
Spoke to my buddy in vice.

325
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,330
He said Harry's whole unit
was on the take.

326
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,730
Captain hung 'em out to dry when
they opened up a corruption probe.

327
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,210
The captain was probably taking
more money than all of them.

328
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,240
Probably why Harry clocked him.

329
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,450
I pulled the accident report
on Bunny.

330
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,250
"Lost control of the car
around a curve.

331
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,440
Hit a tree and burst into flames."

332
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,220
Problem is, Welter says
he saw Harry with Bunny

333
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:35,621
two days before the accident.

334
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,890
With this French character.

335
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,370
Some pet gorilla. Katz says
they never contacted him, though.

336
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,690
So, Lana thinks Harry helped French

337
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:45,191
dodge a manslaughter charge.

338
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,260
Ran the name alias.
Came up Vapors.

339
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,630
Well, figure Harry and French were
scheming to shake down Caroline Hargreave.

340
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,800
It's a pity they don't last longer.

341
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,090
Spoke to your lawyer.

342
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,540
He told me.

343
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,860
This whole thing brings up
terrible memories.

344
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,450
About your stepdaughter Bunny ?

345
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,490
Yes.

346
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,230
We got along just fine
until Stan died.

347
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,440
That when she took off ?

348
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,230
She was very emotional girl.

349
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,750
Had a history of it on her
mother's side of the family.

350
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,200
Tried everything I could to help her.

351
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,990
Including hiring a private investigator.

352
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,080
Oh, Mr. Denton.
He was my lawyer's idea.

353
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,990
I never trusted that man.

354
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,470
Like try and shake you down ?

355
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,310
The night before the accident,
he came over here and

356
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:40,211
gave me some cock-and-bull story
about needing more money.

357
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,290
Looks painful.

358
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,030
Makes them easier to handle.

359
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,340
See ?

360
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,200
That's a dragon's eye.

361
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,710
This one here's an American Beauty.

362
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,580
How about that ?

363
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,830
Wilson said you had news to report.

364
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,420
Have you located Bunny ?

365
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,740
Not exactly.

366
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,690
The investigation's
hit a couple of snags.

367
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,410
You need more money, Mr. Denton ?

368
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,170
Well, there is a direct correlation
between results and money

369
00:18:14,171 --> 00:18:16,071
especially with these recovery jobs.

370
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,420
Very well.

371
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,920
I'll have Wilson advance you
more funds.

372
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,190
What do you call this ?

373
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,590
- Primrose.
- Ah, primrose.

374
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,060
I can't have Bunny running wild,

375
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:35,161
and exposed herself to God knows
what sort of dangers.

376
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,070
I expect results, Mr. Denton.

377
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,870
Oh, I'm onto something all right.

378
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,090
I knew right then he was up
to something.

379
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,050
Was he after money or
gardening tips ?

380
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,170
I knew he had Bunny.

381
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,000
You should have gone to the police.

382
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,150
Yeah, a lot of things
I should have done.

383
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,770
Instead, I hired his assistant,

384
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,271
had her check up on him.

385
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,460
- Lana.
- Yes

386
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,370
She agreed to help me,
for a price, of course.

387
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,950
But the next night, I got the call
about the accident.

388
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,350
I blame myself.

389
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,780
I should have just let her go.

390
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,040
Left a few things out, Lana.

391
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,530
Caroline Hargreave hired
you to check on Harry.

392
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,400
She wanted her daughter back.

393
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,070
So you double-crossed Harry.

394
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,530
She called me and asked
me to check on him.

395
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,420
She no longer trusted Harry.

396
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,150
What about you ?

397
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,930
I figured Harry and French
were cooking up some scheme.

398
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,610
<i>"Stuck in the middle with you"
by Steelers Wheel.</i>

399
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,040
I figured she'd send somebody,
but I didn't think it'd be you.

400
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,360
Well, what do you think, Harry ?

401
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,540
She wants her daughter back.

402
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,180
I bet she does.

403
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,260
Tell her I'm off the case.

404
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,570
What's going on ?

405
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,100
How much she paying you ?

406
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,930
Enough to open my own agency.

407
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,460
It's always the pretty ones
you don't see coming.

408
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,110
French ! Stop her !

409
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,050
Come on. She's gonna get away !

410
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,100
Hurry, get in !

411
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,180
Oh, my God, stop the car, Harry !

412
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,610
Bunny.

413
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,060
Harry told me to get the hell out
of there and keep my mouth shut.

414
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,530
He was still looking out for you
even though you betrayed him.

415
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,530
I still think about him all the time.

416
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,320
That the last time you saw Harry ?

417
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,390
Came back to the office to apologize,
and French was there.

418
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,650
Cleaning out the safe ?

419
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,260
put a gun in my face and
told me to keep my mouth shut.

420
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,680
What the hell ?

421
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,540
Can't you see I'm taking
a table nap ?

422
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,220
Been a lot of those lately.

423
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,630
What do you got ?

424
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,910
Some other case.
Don't worry about it.

425
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,340
French's real name is Chuck Jaworski.

426
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,620
Did a stint in Graterford
for extortion,

427
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,621
resisting arrest, assault.

428
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,350
Old school bad-ass.

429
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,670
Harry helped him dodge
a manslaughter charge.

430
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,500
Did some pro bono snooping
for French's defense lawyer.

431
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,850
Good guy to have in your debt.

432
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,710
You check on that address
tinicum Lana gave us ?

433
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,620
Yeah, a lot of mice and daddy longlegs,
but no French.

434
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,930
Put word out to the local watering
holes a neighbor said he frequents.

435
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,680
- Got his info out to patrol.
- He turns up, I'm on it.

436
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,310
Now, if you don't mind.

437
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,930
Detective Rush.

438
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,870
See you found some good company.

439
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:57,250
DUI checkpoint popped up right outside
my favorite watering hole. Imagine that.

440
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,300
A good thing, getting folks
like you off the street.

441
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,910
I'll make bail.

442
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,020
Thought you already got out on bail.

443
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,490
Sure a Philly judge will think twice.

444
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,990
This is harassment.

445
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,500
Place you're gonna end up

446
00:23:11,501 --> 00:23:13,401
once your lawyers run out
of motions to file

447
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,902
is a whole lot worse than this.

448
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,180
The least I can do is get you
out of the tank and into a cell.

449
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,070
Comes with a cell mate, though.

450
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,300
Not a bad guy.

451
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,990
As long as he's on his meds.

452
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,540
See that Mr. Kitchener
and Tiko get acquainted.

453
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,170
What have been up to ?

454
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,280
Not hungry.

455
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,090
She told you, huh ?

456
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,180
You could've told me earlier;

457
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,950
You know,
she asked me not to.

458
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,220
That's it, then.

459
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,310
What ?

460
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,730
It's over. We want this
all behind us.

461
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,310
So drop it.

462
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,370
Drop it ?

463
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,520
Pop, ma' was robbed.

464
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,450
Knocked to the ground.

465
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,230
This is what your mother wants.

466
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah, but, well, I want to make
sure this guy doesn't do it again.

467
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,260
Olvidate.

468
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,270
We canceled the cards
and the money doesn't matter.

469
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,730
Pop, you asked me to look into this.

470
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,940
I'm gonna find him.

471
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,520
You do what you have to do.

472
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,240
As far as your mother's concerned,
it's over.

473
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,400
Podemos comer ahora ?

474
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,540
Don't you come in pairs ?

475
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,540
Not today.

476
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,180
What are you, buying next round ?

477
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,290
Maybe after you come down
to the station

478
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,091
and answer a few questions
about Harry Denton.

479
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,040
Like hell I am.

480
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,810
Sure you want to push this, gramps ?

481
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,640
Not the first cop I mopped
the floor with.

482
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,640
Go ahead. Take your best shot.
I'll live.

483
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,700
But you'll be picking your dentures
off the floor when I'm finished.

484
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,490
That some kind of asian move ?

485
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,070
Now, we can do this all over downtown,

486
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:37,471
or we can just call it a mulligan.

487
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,950
Ah, hell. Mulligan.

488
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,840
So, what were you and Denton
doing with Bunny Hargreave ?

489
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,860
I promised Harry I'd keep
my trap shut.

490
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,230
Harry's dead.

491
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,710
Somebody shot him.

492
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,100
Well, at least he's got an excuse
how come he don't call me up no more.

493
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,700
Lana said she caught you trying
to break into his safe.

494
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,770
Yeah, okay, I might have done
something like that,

495
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:03,871
but I didn't kill Harry.

496
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,520
I owe that guy my life.

497
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,400
So what were you guys trying to do ?

498
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,750
Shake down Caroline Hargreave ?

499
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,980
The rich broad ?

500
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,130
He had her daughter
stashed in your safe house.

501
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,930
Harry was trying to protect
that girl.

502
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,030
From what ?

503
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,520
Beats me.

504
00:26:18,721 --> 00:26:21,521
I mean, I didn't understand
the ins and outs or what have you.

505
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,690
I just did what Harry told me to do.

506
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,540
You followed ?

507
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:37,110
Went through precautions, all right ?
Did like you said.

508
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,370
You have any problems ?

509
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,550
- Just Lana.
- She suspect anything ?

510
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,710
Nope. If she did,
I scared her good.

511
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,130
Look, here.

512
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,654
I need you to make sure that
your buddy at the morgue

513
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:50,555
keeps his trap shut
about that loaner.

514
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,410
Something wrong ?

515
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,270
What kind of job is this ?

516
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,786
The kind that could
get us both locked up.

517
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,210
I'm trying real hard to do
the right thing here, French.

518
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:07,990
You're getting soft, Harry.

519
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,210
Shut up.

520
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,250
All right.

521
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,820
I need you to go see Frank Bandini,
tell him we need a full kit

522
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,650
I.D. passport, birth certificate,
the whole deal.

523
00:27:19,476 --> 00:27:20,929
We're gonna need a name.

524
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,450
We need a name.

525
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,605
For what ?

526
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,570
Your new life.

527
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,310
Clara.

528
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,460
Clara Dunaway.

529
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,833
Only me, you and dead Harry
know she's alive.

530
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,660
Whose body was in the wreck ?

531
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,846
Some Jane Doe I borrowed
from the morgue.

532
00:27:54,618 --> 00:27:56,260
Why'd Harry flip the script ?

533
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:57,925
Asked him the same.

534
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Said he was trying
to make things right.

535
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,960
So where's Bunny now ?

536
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,810
Where else nobody
gonna look for you ?

537
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,540
Pine Barrens, New Jersey.

538
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,528
Bunny Hargreave ?

539
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,590
Haven't heard that name in 35 years.

540
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,630
How did you find me ?

541
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,963
Spoke to French.

542
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,760
Now, did you know Harry was dead ?

543
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,801
I knew something bad had
happened when he didn't come back.

544
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,846
Hoping you can fill us in on that.

545
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,416
Why didn't Harry take you back home ?

546
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,260
Take it you met my stepmother.

547
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,550
She thought you died in that wreck.

548
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,810
Sure she put on quite a show for you.

549
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,411
She hired Harry to find you.

550
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,777
Yeah, so she could
ship me off to Oakdale.

551
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,681
Place wasn't a summer camp.

552
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,457
Unless you count drug therapy

553
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,658
or electric shock as activities.

554
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,994
Why would Caroline send you
to a place like that ?

555
00:29:07,344 --> 00:29:08,828
She wanted to keep me quiet.

556
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,122
About what ?

557
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,030
How she killed my father.

558
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,320
What if she finds me ?

559
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,843
She can't.

560
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,451
You're dead, remember ?

561
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,000
Your new I.D.

562
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,080
I never want to see her again.

563
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,380
Well, next time you do see her,
it'll be in a court.

564
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:43,014
I have proof that your stepmother
poisoned your father.

565
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,780
Found this in her greenhouse.

566
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,400
Is this what you saw her give him ?

567
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:51,872
Yes.

568
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,543
He had a cough, so she made
him some of her special soup.

569
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,990
What is it ?

570
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,560
Foxglove.

571
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,530
Deadly poisonous and
can cause a heart attack.

572
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,510
Your stepmom told him it was primrose.

573
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,235
So I wasn't imagining things.

574
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,013
Nope.

575
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:12,210
Of course we can't prove any of this, 'cause
she went and had the body cremated.

576
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,830
Will she get away with this ?

577
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,530
Don't worry.

578
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,110
Old Harry's still got a
few tricks up his sleeve.

579
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,693
Why are you helping me ?

580
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,264
You could've just taken me back to her,

581
00:30:24,265 --> 00:30:26,065
and no one would've ever known
what she did.

582
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,118
I don't know.

583
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,632
Guess I got sick of people
expecting the worst of me.

584
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,494
She'll try to ruin you.

585
00:30:39,736 --> 00:30:40,880
Little late for that.

586
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,680
Might find this hard to believe,
but I used to be a cop.

587
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,190
You must have been a good cop.

588
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,700
I had my moments.

589
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,720
Got caught up in some stuff
I shouldn't have been.

590
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,870
One thing leads to another and...

591
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,465
next thing I know I'm
"anything for a buck" Harry.

592
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,840
Took the money, did the job,
didn't ask questions.

593
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,560
Didn't matter what side I was on.

594
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,780
Hell, I figured everybody
was guilty of something,

595
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:10,681
so why not make a buck off it ?

596
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,227
But you're helping me.

597
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,583
Got to admit, it feels pretty good.

598
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,100
Harry was the only one
who believed me.

599
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,040
About Caroline killing your father.

600
00:31:32,165 --> 00:31:34,641
He said it wasn't the first time
that she poisoned somebody.

601
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,195
Said she'd killed her first husband
and that he had proof.

602
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,310
Now, Harry go to confront her ?

603
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,420
I figured she got to him like she
did to anybody who got in her way.

604
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,250
When Harry didn't come back,
French took me to Jersey.

605
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:51,040
Stanley Hargreave died of a
heart attack in april 1974.

606
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:52,575
A fit with poisoning ?

607
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,604
The M.E. said that foxglove combined
with an already weak heart

608
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:56,705
will result in a heart attack.

609
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,540
They didn't catch it back in the day.

610
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,000
Stanley was 58 years old,
had a history of heart trouble.

611
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,540
I mean, there's no way of saying
for sure unless we have a body.

612
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,990
Oh, she's come a long way.

613
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,380
Well, you cleaned up pretty good, Mandy.

614
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,390
Excuse me ?

615
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,860
A solicitation charge in Tulsa.

616
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,145
Everyone has something in their past
that they're ashamed of.

617
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:24,690
Well, little more than a few
misdemeanors and a change of name.

618
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,140
I'm no longer that person.

619
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,820
Moved on.

620
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,435
You killed your way out of white trash.

621
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,990
What are you talking about ?

622
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,290
Ever been married before ?

623
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,038
I think you know of my
marriage previous to Stan.

624
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:42,500
Well, Stan wasn't the first husband
to die on you.

625
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,714
Insurance claim for Melvin Grover.

626
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,894
Autopsy report said he died
of food poisoning in '64.

627
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,680
One was a heart attack,
the other an unfortunate accident.

628
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,874
Unfortunate only that Harry figured out
that you'd poisoned before.

629
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:04,650
Is that what this is all about,
me outliving my husbands ?

630
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,220
It happens all the time.

631
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,890
Men are the weaker of the species.

632
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:11,820
Genetics had nothing to do
with why you outlived them.

633
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:13,545
I wouldn't know anything about that.

634
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,710
Harry did.

635
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:19,090
Just like he knew why you wanted
Bunny back so bad.

636
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,710
I wanted to help her.

637
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,550
Bunny was a mixed-up girl.

638
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,870
She seemed pretty clearheaded
when I spoke to her.

639
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,190
What are you talking about ?

640
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,930
Harry faked Bunny's death.

641
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,180
That was a Jane Doe in that car.

642
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,540
Is this some kind of game ?

643
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,610
Bunny knew you poisoned her dad.

644
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,520
You have no proof of that, detective.

645
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,080
Harry did.

646
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,920
And you shot him to silence him.

647
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,320
Why would I do that ?

648
00:33:54,321 --> 00:33:56,921
Hiring Mr. Denton
was my lawyer's idea.

649
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,050
- Wilson Katz ?
- Yes

650
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,340
And Harry never contacted you
after the "accident," right ?

651
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,190
I was busy arranging
Bunny's funeral.

652
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,330
I let Wilson deal with everything.

653
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,510
He had power of attorney
over my affairs.

654
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,780
Of course he did.

655
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:16,360
Wilson said he would take care of it,
and I took him at his word.

656
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,380
Sit down.

657
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,340
You're not going anywhere.

658
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,860
I'd like to speak to my lawyer.

659
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,160
Well, he's in the next room
getting ready to flip on you.

660
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,840
Oh, I doubt that very much.

661
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,880
That's one cold bitch.

662
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,610
Tracked down the brother
of Caroline's first husband.

663
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,980
Says a lawyer contacted him
june of '74.

664
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,730
His name's on the exhumation report.

665
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:47,910
Wilson Katz.

666
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,320
Maybe that's the proof
Harry was talking about.

667
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,170
counselor.

668
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,970
I'd like to speak with my client,
Caroline Hargreave.

669
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,900
She has a right to legal counsel.

670
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,690
Well, you might want to
consider some for yourself.

671
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,990
What would you like to know, detective ?

672
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,140
Remember Melvin ?

673
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,380
Who ?

674
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,910
The first husband
of Mandy Mae Smith.

675
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:20,100
That's your signature on
the exhumation request.

676
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,590
I was acting on behalf
of Caroline Hargreave.

677
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,470
Oh, just loyal that way ?

678
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:29,800
Digging up her dead ex-husband,
or something else ?

679
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,260
I know how this game
is played, detective.

680
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,760
Been at it since
before you were born.

681
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,600
You had Caroline's first
husband cremated

682
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:41,001
a week after Harry was killed.

683
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,830
I had power of attorney
over her affairs.

684
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,620
And power to get rid of that body, too.

685
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,760
You met with Harry
after the accident.

686
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,500
I figure he pointed out Caroline's
habit of offing her husbands.

687
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,260
I already told you I met with Harry,
to pay him.

688
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,480
That was before we figured out
Harry had Bunny.

689
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,200
If that's all you have, detective,

690
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,401
I'll take my chances in court.

691
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,550
It's not.

692
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,900
We spoke to the owner of the
building you buried Harry in.

693
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,260
You put in a bid to buy it.

694
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,100
You were outbid by.

695
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,580
Ten grand.

696
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,770
You cheap bastard.

697
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,530
I know this looks bad.

698
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,750
Eh, save it for the jury.

699
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,280
Tell them how she put you up to it.

700
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,840
I was her attorney,
it was my job to protect her.

701
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Yeah, but you were Harry's buddy.

702
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,890
At least he thought so.

703
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,420
If only Harry had just done his job.

704
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,810
What job was that ?

705
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,150
Bring Bunny back so Caroline
could silence her ?

706
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,170
Harry tried to tell me, and I...

707
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,080
wouldn't listen.

708
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,530
To tell you what ?

709
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,980
What Caroline was up to ?

710
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,490
look,she's in that room
throwing you under the bus.

711
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:04,290
You don't think I know that ?

712
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,920
She set the whole thing up that way.

713
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:11,180
Then don't let her walk
for what she did to Harry.

714
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,260
Give me something.

715
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,880
She was smarter than me.

716
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,540
Smarter than Stan.

717
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,590
Even you, detective.

718
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,510
What does she have over you ?

719
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,480
'Cause she's playing you
for a sucker.

720
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,130
Even now.

721
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,080
She was so beautiful.

722
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,760
You just wanted to make
things right for her.

723
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,600
What's this about, Harry ?

724
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,070
I figured I'd give you a chance
to get in front of this.

725
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,300
What are you talking about ?
It's over.

726
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,460
Bunny's dead. Your services
are no longer need.

727
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,980
I figured out why she
wanted Bunny back so bad.

728
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,320
Whatever Bunny said to you,
it's not true.

729
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,280
Caroline killed her husband, Wilson.

730
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,010
Now, I'm guessing she had a couple
of million reasons to do it,

731
00:38:14,011 --> 00:38:15,211
but it's still murder.

732
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,820
Have you been drinking, Harry ?

733
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,300
She fed him poison, made it
look like a heart attack.

734
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,280
You have no proof of that.

735
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,000
Oh, I have proof.

736
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,850
And Bunny saw her do it.

737
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,930
Bunny's dead.

738
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,920
It's a real tragedy.

739
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,960
But it's over.

740
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,760
It's not over.

741
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,900
I...

742
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,000
Dragon's eye.

743
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,320
It's just roses.

744
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,470
Guy like you ain't
buying fresh roses, Wilson.

745
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,370
What'd she do,
wink at you or something ?

746
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,260
No.

747
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,020
It's more than that.

748
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:57,780
Oh, you stupid son of a bitch,
you love her, don't you ?

749
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,260
Why, she's got you all
turned around, hasn't she ?

750
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,700
Now,I strongly advise you
to walk out that door,harry,

751
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,630
and forget all about this.

752
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,280
She's done it before, Wilson.

753
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,390
Next time you're giving her a foot rub,

754
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,430
ask her about her first husband.

755
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,510
Yeah. Didn't know
about that one, huh ?

756
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,350
Name's Melvin Grover.

757
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:19,170
Married him back when
she was Mandy Mae Smith.

758
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,940
Well, you've concocted
a hell of a story.

759
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,610
It's not a story.

760
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,510
And I'm not letting this
get swept under the rug.

761
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,020
That never stopped you before.

762
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,310
Listen, you dumb bastard,
get away from this.

763
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,100
Get as far away as you can!

764
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,120
I'm going to the police.

765
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,920
Wait,wait,wait.

766
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,790
What's it gonna cost for you
to forget this nonsense, huh ?

767
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,080
Ten thousand ?

768
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,360
Twenty ?

769
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,240
I'm not that guy anymore.

770
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,770
Just take the money, Harry.

771
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,410
Now, that's the Harry I know.

772
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,250
I'm going to the police.

773
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,100
With what ? A couple of names ?

774
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,340
The rantings of a dead girl ?

775
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,640
Take the money, Harry.

776
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,400
Not this time.

777
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,250
Stop right there.

778
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,550
You ain't gonna shoot me.

779
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,110
You don't know that.

780
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,980
Must be one hell of a retainer
she's got you on, Wilson.

781
00:41:04,281 --> 00:41:08,281
