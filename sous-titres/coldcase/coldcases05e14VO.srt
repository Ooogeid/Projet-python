00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,760
December 4,2006

2
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,860
what the hell is going on?

3
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,670
It's past curfew on a wednesday night.

4
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,170
Andy,you're in trouble.

5
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,140
the heart broke

6
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,340
everyone came to stay warm

7
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,290
we're trying to stay alive

8
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,280
this is child abuse

9
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,970
we're just sad deaf children

10
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,960
that is very funny.

11
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,980
how'bout a dance?

12
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,800
Andy,please,you guys all have
to go to bed now,seriously.

13
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,390
one more song...

14
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,390
then lights out.

15
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,050
feels like we landed
in a foreign country.

16
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,450
One of philly's few high
schools for the deaf.

17
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,380
Founded in 1872.

18
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,690
Shoved them out in the boondocks.

19
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,110
All that gesturing,seems like
they're fighting all the time.

20
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,490
You think they're talking about us?

21
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,500
Yeah,he's pointing at
the donut on your chin.

22
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,320
This place gives me the creeps.

23
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,770
morning,boss.

24
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,990
Lil,nick.

25
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,390
What's up?

26
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,640
December 18,'06.

27
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,320
Deaf student andy rierdan
went missing from home.

28
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,100
School was closed for christmas break?

29
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,790
Yeah. Initial theory was a runaway.

30
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,090
So what are we doing here?

31
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,990
Teacher was cleaning things out,found
blood traces on the piano keys.

32
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,570
Lab just confirmed the id.

33
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,980
Matches andy'S.

34
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,300
You saying andy was killed here?

35
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,450
Could have had a
nosebleed playing piano.

36
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,930
Deaf kid playing the piano,nick?

37
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,620
Spot of blood ain't conclusive,boss.

38
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,620
James.

39
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,250
Conclusive enough for you?

40
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,500
That ain't a nosebleed.

41
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,630
Looks like our runaway
didn't stray far from home.

42
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,920
Killed in a place where
no one can hear you scream.

46
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,080
I still can't believe this.

47
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,300
I mean,you haven't found...

48
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,620
we're searching the
campus for andy's body.

49
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,070
Many students stay on campus
over the christmas break?

50
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,860
Andy wasn't even staying here.

51
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,000
It doesn't make sense.

52
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,940
But there were other students around?

53
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,970
You don't think another student...

54
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,170
We'll need the names of everyone
who was on campus that week.

55
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,750
Of course.

56
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,830
Are the parents here?

57
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,320
Yeah,they're waiting in my office.

58
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,940
I understand they're both,uh...

59
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,300
deaf.

60
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,830
It's okay to use that word.

61
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,930
I'm happy to interpret
for you if you need me.

62
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,520
Oh,yeah,we'll need you.

63
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,030
Now,how's it work?

64
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,240
Most of these kids' parents deaf,too?

65
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,030
No,andy's are the exception.

66
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,790
They're both deaf and
both deeply caring.

67
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,930
And the other parents?

68
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,950
Most of the hearing parents
of the students at our school

69
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,750
don't even bother to learn
american sign language.

70
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,690
The school's a dump site for them.

71
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,920
You been working here long?

72
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,140
12 years.

73
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,790
That's a long time.

74
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,430
Every time I want to quit,I think
about the parents who already have.

75
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,440
They're talking about you again.

76
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,700
What's that pointing sign?

77
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,230
I keep seeing it around here.

78
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,310
It means "murder."

79
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,110
They're saying that you
two are homicide detectives.

80
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,860
The finger stands for a knife.

81
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,540
I have no idea who would
want to hurt our son.

82
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,440
We never thought andy ran away.

83
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,840
The cops didn't believe us.

84
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,870
They thought that we were deaf and dumb.

85
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,070
Sorry to hear that.

86
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,980
We'll do our best to
find out what happened.

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,900
Andy ever get into any trouble?

88
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,140
No,he was a popular
kid who everyone liked.

89
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,320
Andy was a proud...

90
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,600
he wants you to know andy was a
proud member of the deaf community.

91
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,960
He was as good as any hearing child.

92
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,720
How long was andy enrolled here?

93
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:44,490
He lost his hearing when he was seven after
he became sick with... spinal meningitis.

94
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,260
But he never complained.

95
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,370
He took to our world wonderfully.

96
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,990
"Our world"?

97
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,340
Over the years,the deaf community has
developed their own separate culture.

98
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,830
You'd think they wouldn't
want to be separate.

99
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,810
Well,if you have your own language,you
feel comfortable with your own.

100
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,150
Well,that's just moving hands.

101
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,750
Asl is a beautiful emotive language.

102
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,260
You should try learning it.

103
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,540
About andy,you know how parents are.

104
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,980
Was he really such a saint?

105
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,780
A saint? No.

106
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,800
He was mischievous.

107
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,230
He was kind of wild,but he...

108
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,450
he was a great kid at heart.

109
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,840
He was a straight "a" student.

110
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,390
They can read your lips,by the way.

111
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,810
Sorry, I had to ask.

112
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,450
Any idea what andy was
doing back on campus?

113
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,880
Who had access to that room?

114
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,180
Well,that room hadn't
been used in years.

115
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,160
Someone must have had a key.

116
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,610
I did.

117
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,710
And a month before andy
disappeared,I gave the key to someone.

118
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,710
- did you finish your college essay yet?
- almost

119
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,590
when i get to galudett

120
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,220
me and andy are gonna be roommates

121
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,550
we'll throw great parties

122
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,590
best buds forever

123
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,270
No,I'm at that school.

124
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,170
- I started today,remember?
- You two best buds...

125
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,520
Need to study more and party less.

126
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,110
Yeah,kind of dickens-orphan depressing.

127
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,630
Dickens was a writer,daddy. Gotta go.

128
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,250
Morning,emma.

129
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,610
emma will be volunteering
here for a month.

130
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,950
Have you been playing long?

131
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,500
I wouldn't call it playing.

132
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,860
I just know some basics
from when I took lessons.

133
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,600
Well,the kids will love it.

134
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,100
This is andy and carlos.

135
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,020
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

136
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,450
This is such a nice place.

137
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,450
how'd you learn asl?

138
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,660
I took a class for two
years for extra credit.

139
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,870
you should take it again

140
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,130
deaf kids love playing piano

141
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,260
I thought some could,you
know,feel the vibration.

142
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,030
sure we can

143
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,300
sounds beautiful

144
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,630
andy.

145
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,350
What is wrong?!

146
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,520
She wants to help!

147
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,490
really?

148
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,810
were you forced to,

149
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,080
or is helping-the-disabled
extra credit

150
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,840
Andy!

151
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,810
You don't know me.

152
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,000
i've seen your type

153
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,350
you're an

154
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,030
ivy league-bound
kiss-ass

155
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,280
And you're the big shot at a school where most
of the kids graduate with a fifth-grade education.

156
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:28,790
Emma!

157
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,960
You're not disabled.

158
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,070
You're pathetic.

159
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,520
Sorry. Maybe this isn't gonna work out.

160
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,210
this emma the only one
with a key to the room?

161
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,140
Yes,I gave her the key,yeah.

162
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,200
Some fireworks,but it seems like
emma quit long before andy died.

163
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,610
No,she couldn't quit.

164
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,980
And why's that?

165
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,530
Well,she wasn't here out of
the kindness of her heart.

166
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,680
It was a court-ordered
community service.

167
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,900
What did she do?

168
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,920
Uh,dui.

169
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,500
Emma was a very complicated girl.

170
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,830
But she stayed,and she
actually became a great teacher.

171
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,890
The kids liked her.

172
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,150
But not andy.

173
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,710
No.

174
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,440
Did you know emma?

175
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,280
No,we never met.

176
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,180
Andy,he only really
liked his own people.

177
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,000
You and andy didn't get along.

178
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,850
The security logs over the christmas break show
you were at the school the day andy disappeared.

179
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,330
You there to see him?

180
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,020
I went to grab my laptop,okay?

181
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,960
I didn't see andy.

182
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,340
Things get worse between you two?

183
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,170
Better.

184
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,200
Actually,much as it
hurt,he had me down cold.

185
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,580
Meaning you didn't give a
rat's ass about those kids.

186
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:51,490
All I cared about was clearing my record
and getting accepted at an ivy league school.

187
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,550
And you succeeded?

188
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,930
On both counts.

189
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,880
I'm sure you checked.

190
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,930
So he was right about you.

191
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,810
And I was wrong about him.

192
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,290
I thought he was just a party boy.

193
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,210
Something change between you two?

194
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,360
Yeah.

195
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,080
Two days after we met,he came to me.

196
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,110
not done criticizing me?

197
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,230
sorry

198
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,720
i said stupid stuff to make carlos laugh

199
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,940
It's okay.

200
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,140
You were kind of funny,too.

201
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,050
And I was mean.

202
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,600
You know why I'm really here,right?

203
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,770
i heard

204
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,300
you drove home drunk from a party?

205
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,670
if you say something weird

206
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,240
i'll pretend i didn't hear

207
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,440
I had a huge fight with my dad.

208
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,350
I was all sad and weirded out.

209
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,070
I thought that drinking a half
bottle of vodka would help.

210
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,210
what was the fight about?

211
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,200
I only got a b-plus
on an english paper.

212
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:13,890
this from the guy who
doesn't know dickens?

213
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,620
my dad's a third
- generation steelworker.

214
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,200
He wants his daughter to do better.

215
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,260
A lot better.

216
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,970
the quiet is so peaceful.

217
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,190
i can find this peace anytime

218
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,100
i live in a beautiful world

219
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,020
hearing people don't understand

220
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,600
help me understand.

221
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,870
you hear with your eyes?

222
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,140
you want to know what
my voice sounds like?

223
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,930
I don't know.

224
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,870
It sounds like... me.

225
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,240
what the hell are you doing?!

226
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,450
looking at the sky

227
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,970
that hearing slut's not one of us

228
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,260
why are you with her?

229
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,990
wait,you got
it all wrong--

230
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,560
see! i'm his girlfriend

231
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,160
not you

232
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,660
i meant you got it wrong about us

233
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,210
you're mine

234
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,940
don't you forget it

235
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,730
this leah was andy's girlfriend?

236
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,430
That's what she thought,anyway.

237
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,480
She ever threaten andy again?

238
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,630
No.

239
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,470
But she'd always be...around.

240
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,630
It was kind of weird.

241
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,350
Fatal attraction weird?

242
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,420
Andy told me sometimes he'd see
her standing out in the quad,

243
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,660
just staring up at his room for hours.

244
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,280
What about you and andy?

245
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,510
You two hook up?

246
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,700
For like two seconds,but I broke it off.

247
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,640
Why?

248
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,650
We were too... different.

249
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,440
Everything okay,lil?

250
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,850
Sure.

251
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,790
Why not?

252
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,960
Good.

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,900
Dean harden finally faxed over the list
of kids on campus during christmas break.

254
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,440
Leah o'rafferty on it?

255
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,250
Yup.

256
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,020
And take a look at her school records.

257
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,180
Suspended last year for
stalkinger ex-boyfriend.

258
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,960
Threw a rock through his dorm window?

259
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,980
While he was asleep.

260
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,760
Almost took out an eye.

261
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,090
A dangerous girl to break up with.

262
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Yeah. Thanks.

263
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,400
Still no luck finding
andy's body near the campus.

264
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,960
- We got the dogs out?
- The works.

265
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,820
- Got something for you.
- Yeah?

266
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,570
Yeah. You're real popular this
morning-- it's a jarrod jones?

267
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,320
Everything all right?

268
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,390
Couldn't be better.

269
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,100
You don't want to know.

270
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,900
Figure that might help us understand
who we're talking to a little better.

271
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,230
Yeah. Learning any?

272
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,080
Yeah. Um...

273
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,820
what does that mean?

274
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,460
"You're buying lunch."

275
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,900
Really?

276
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,500
Well,how do you sign,"you still
owe me 50 bucks from poker"?

277
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,940
Uh... it's,uh...

278
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,380
I always thought that
meant something else.

279
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,200
Leah,I heard you were jealous when
andy started spending time with emma.

280
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,950
I can hear you.

281
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,560
I have a cochlear.

282
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,080
A cochlear?

283
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,250
A cochlear implant.

284
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,860
Show her,leah.

285
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,090
It's an outpatient surgery
that helps restore hearing.

286
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,550
It's a cure?

287
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,660
Not exactly.

288
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,150
Works different for every candidate.

289
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,080
I can hear a twig snap now.

290
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,030
Leah,were you upset when
he broke it off with you?

291
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,450
I wath... I wath...

292
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,690
I was mad at first,but...

293
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,370
I could never stay mad at andy.

294
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,540
Well,that's not what I heard.

295
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,960
Don't lie to me,leah.

296
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,800
I'm not lying.

297
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,710
I wasn't mad. I loved him.

298
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,900
But he tossed you aside.

299
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,290
He used you.

300
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:34,400
And you followed him...
couldn't let it go.

301
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,880
I wasn't the only one mad at andy.

302
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,950
you gonna ask emma out?

303
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,660
she's just a friend

304
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,800
she wants to turn you
into a hearing person--

305
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,750
into one of them

306
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
no,she won't

307
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,160
she'll want you to get a cochlear

308
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,030
don't push me,bitch

309
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,250
you'll be a nobody in the hearing world

310
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,030
go to hell

311
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,270
hey,kid! Get outta the way!

312
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,940
****

313
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,540
****Get outta the way!

314
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,500
He was so interested
in the hearing world

315
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,240
I couldn't compete,so.I gave up.

316
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,700
It hurt...

317
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,880
was carlos still mad
at andy before he died?

318
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,940
I think so.

319
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,230
They weren't hanging out much.

320
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,430
Do you think carlos might have hurt him?

321
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,510
He does have a bad temper.

322
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,490
And he's acted so strange.

323
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,220
He won't go near andy's old room.

324
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,190
Hi.

325
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,220
Carlos.

326
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,940
I'm detective vera.

327
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:19,500
This is detective
j-e-f-f-r-i-e-s.

328
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,300
We want to talk with you.

329
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,100
"Your signing sucks. I read lips good."

330
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,120
So you understand me?

331
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,540
You have two assault charges
on your juvie record,carlos.

332
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,890
And we know you and
andy got into a fight.

333
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,810
You were on campus the night he died.

334
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,610
i never saw him

335
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,840
Yeah,right.

336
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,260
Did leah say I got into a fight?

337
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,640
It doesn't matter who said it,carlos.

338
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,490
"Leah's a freak with an implant."

339
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,330
Admit it,carlos,

340
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,780
you can't stand the fact that your
best friend wanted the hearing chick.

341
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,500
"Wrong about emma."

342
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,950
i was walking by a classroom, i saw andy

343
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,340
why didn't you tell me you could play?

344
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,630
i used to play as a kid

345
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,030
That was amazing.

346
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,880
i performed a little before i was deaf

347
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,950
Where?

348
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,300
Small concert halls?

349
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,950
So you were a prodigy?

350
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,410
Do you still...

351
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,520
why?

352
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,990
Well... beethoven
composed when he was deaf.

353
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,290
he was a kiss-ass who
only wrote for the rich

354
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,180
What are you playing?

355
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,740
chopin

356
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,490
his chords are very "visual"

357
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,260
What do you mean by "visual"?

358
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,140
it's what i hear in my
head when i see snow...

359
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,260
rain...

360
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,230
this is stupid.

361
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,890
No,it's beautiful.

362
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,100
What chord do you hear
when you see me,andy?

363
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,680
i told you, i don't play. no point

364
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,680
Isn't there a way for you to hear again?

365
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,800
Have you thought about
getting a cochlear,andy?

366
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,830
you keep calling me "candy"

367
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,430
spell it like this

368
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,930
What the hell is going on?

369
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,880
Dad.

370
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,550
Get... get away from her!

371
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,530
You're hurting me,daddy!

372
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,720
Stay away from my daughter!

373
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,430
You people need to stay with your own!

374
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,840
And I ever see you
near my daughter again,

375
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,780
I'll break every finger you got.

376
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,520
Let's get out of here.

377
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,910
Her dad sounds like a real nice guy.

378
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,800
What was he doing there?

379
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,060
"Emma lost license. He
drove her to school."

380
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,520
Did emma keep seeing andy?

381
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:33,030
Thank you for your time,car... los.

382
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,040
"Your signing still sucks."

383
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,550
Whatever.

384
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,530
It's beautiful how you're
bonding with the students.

385
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,600
Deaf or not,that kid's still a punk.

386
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,690
Same thing emma's dad
thought about andy.

387
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,470
Yeah. The question is,was
he willing to kill over it?

388
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:59,250
didn't like your daughter
dating a freak,did you,al?

389
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,730
But andy wasn't the kind
of guy who would back off.

390
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,520
You saw it yourself.

391
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,220
So I killed a teenage
boy to keep him away?

392
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,850
Come on.

393
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,140
You did threaten him.

394
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,000
Look,I'm sorry this little
crippled boy got killed,

395
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,850
but he had no business with my kid.

396
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,140
Because he was deaf.

397
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,330
Hell,yeah.

398
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,500
Emma has a bright future.

399
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,320
If she stayed with that boy,she'd
have been a nurse for life.

400
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,570
But she saw him again,al.

401
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,420
Question is,did you?

402
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,090
I was inspecting a site halfway
across the state that weekend.

403
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,690
- Got records to back that up?
- Sure do.

404
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,830
Good.

405
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:38,960
Anyway,I went to the dean to tell her
to keep that boy away from my daughter.

406
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,160
I'll bet you did.

407
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,270
Yeah,but she took his side.

408
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,410
Told me emma wasn't
welcome in the school.

409
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,900
Are you saying vivian fired emma?

410
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,870
Bawled her out,more like.

411
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,250
Said emma had no right being with andy.

412
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:59,770
Ask me,that dean,she
had a thing for him.

413
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,650
When was this?

414
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,350
Two days before the christmas break.

415
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,300
So emma didn't just
leave-- you fired her.

416
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,720
Well,that that type of behavior
was completely inappropriate.

417
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,820
Andy was a
good-looking,charming young man.

418
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,700
Any of the teachers have a crush on him?

419
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,920
Anything... inappropriate?

420
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,440
Of course not.

421
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,410
He was a
17-year-old boy.

422
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,170
What about you?

423
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,930
That's absurd.

424
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,880
I don't like being lied to,vivian.

425
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,600
I'm not.

426
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,870
The warrant on your computer
turned up an interesting e-mail.

427
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,900
"Andy,we have to meet. I
think your parents know. V."

428
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,240
Andy must have deleted
his back in the day.

429
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,310
You saved yours.

430
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,730
Now,what were you saying about
not having a crush on andy?

431
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,550
I swear...

432
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,340
you and andy had a little tryst.

433
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,200
Something go wrong?

434
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,640
This wasn't about me and andy.

435
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,900
No?

436
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,970
It was about emma and andy.

437
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,550
He was making a big mistake.

438
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,420
He was trying to be a part of her world.

439
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,030
Now,I went to his
parents to discuss it...

440
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,920
we all just want to
understand what's going on.

441
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,920
i met a girl i like

442
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,150
i want to know her better

443
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,180
it will never last

444
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,560
why?

445
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,140
it never works when our worlds combine

446
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,980
i've seen it

447
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,410
what if we were from
the same stupid world?

448
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,680
what are you saying?

449
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,460
i want to get a cochlear

450
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,720
i want to hear emma's voice

451
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,040
and...hers

452
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:50,060
if i hear i'll have a better future

453
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,950
i supervise ten hearing people in my job

454
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,160
but you can't move up

455
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,690
you're limited

456
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,090
****

457
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,650
you'll be neither deaf nor hearing

458
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,360
you'll be nowhere

459
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,440
they'll call you a freak

460
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,660
the doctor says i'm a perfect candidate

461
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,530
the doctor?

462
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,020
you've been going behind our backs?

463
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,590
doing this says my parents aren't normal

464
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,450
do you want to betray your mother?

465
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,090
what about the girl?

466
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,170
i'll end it

467
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:02,880
Andy realized that trying to fit
into her world would be a mistake.

468
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,910
He knew he belonged with his own.

469
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,920
From your boy jones again.

470
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,980
This whole "you're out sick"
thing is getting kind of old.

471
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,160
Say I died,then.

472
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
You know,it's none of my business,

473
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,410
but maybe you should let this
guy meet his own daughter.

474
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,140
You're right.

475
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,230
It's none of your business.

476
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,450
I've been spending a lot
of time with toni's son.

477
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,510
Kid's taking to me.

478
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,470
Good for you.

479
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,470
It's never going to be the same
as having his real father,though.

480
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,170
Not even close.

481
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,000
So you're a parent for five minutes,now
you're schooling me how to do it?

482
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,900
That's not what I'm doing.

483
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,490
You don't get it.

484
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,370
I start telling her about him,

485
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,380
I got to tell her about me,

486
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,800
who I was back then.

487
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,700
So who were you back then?

488
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,310
Someone I'm not now.

489
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,800
Someone who would spend one...

490
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,930
reckless night with a jarrod jones.

491
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,330
She finds out who I really was...

492
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,030
it'll breaker h heart.

493
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,040
No way that's going to happen.

494
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,730
You were willing to defy
your dad,but andy obeyed his.

495
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,890
Come on,emma,you really just let it go?

496
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:58,700
I left school,put the piano back
in storage,and didn't hear from him.

497
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,130
Then you were home sick
with mono for a month.

498
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,930
I was heartbroken because andy was gone.

499
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,520
Or... you were feeling bad 'cause you
killed the guy who broke your heart.

500
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,110
I would never hurt him.

501
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,180
Andy dumped you for the deaf world.

502
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:16,900
You admitted you... you
drink when you get sad.

503
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,970
Lot of booze.

504
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:26,410
You went back after having a few
and things got out of control,right?

505
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,640
did you?

506
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,880
but it wasn't what you think.

507
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,390
Why don't you enlighten me,then?

508
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,110
I didn't want to tell you
before because,even now,

509
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,870
if his parents knew the truth,it
would break their hearts.

510
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,160
hey,you didn't text me back.

511
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,760
busy with finals

512
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:03,190
Yeah. Last day of school.

513
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,720
How'd your tests go?

514
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,810
there's no point in us staying friends

515
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,530
That's stupid and you know it.

516
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,370
never said i was smart

517
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,540
You're not going to get the implant?

518
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,760
i'm deaf

519
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,740
i don't need to change

520
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,650
You used to hear.

521
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,030
doesn't matter

522
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,620
i was doing it to make you happy

523
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,220
It's not about anyone
but you,and you know it.

524
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,350
i gotta go

525
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,680
You're scared.

526
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,640
- You're scared to hear yourself play,aren't you? 
- that's stupid--

527
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,140
'Cause what if you're not good anymore?

528
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,280
leave me alone. please

529
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,210
Don't you want to hear the snow again?

530
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,840
Andy?

531
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,400
Don't you?

532
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,650
Don't you want to hear me?

533
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,470
You gave him the storage room key.

534
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,090
Thinking he got the implant?

535
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,430
I don't know if he ever
found the courage to.

536
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,040
If he did,sure would
have pissed off dad.

537
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,080
we just found the body.

538
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,990
Anything off the body?

539
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,120
Yeah,literally.

540
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,150
Csu found this near the skull.

541
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,650
Cochlear implant?

542
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,910
You got it.

543
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,800
Looks like our boy
andy found his courage.

544
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,730
Decided not to let his parents
keep him down any longer.

545
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,790
Andy turns his back on his own people.

546
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,500
It's the ultimate act of betrayal.

547
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:12,890
trace the serial number Of the cochlear to a clinic in min manhattan.

548
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,640
There's dad's signatures
on the release form.

549
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,160
Well,it's got to be a forgery.

550
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,590
Had the outpatient surgery
for the implant december 18.

551
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,770
Day he went missing.

552
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,590
Goes back to school to
hide from his parents.

553
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,130
Unless they found out.

554
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,660
Maybe dad was waiting for him.

555
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:35,560
You must have been upset when
you found andy got an implant.

556
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,320
He betrayed you.

557
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,760
Did you track him down at school?

558
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,450
We think this is a forgery.

559
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,210
"It has to be."

560
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,280
When did you find out,ed?

561
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,220
he never did

562
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,960
Come on,ed.

563
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,460
I know this is hard.

564
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,360
I signed it.

565
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,890
it was time to let andy live

566
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
where are you going?

567
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,980
you can't stop me

568
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,170
i know

569
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,820
where'd you find that?

570
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,890
up in the attic

571
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,350
i remember you playing that chopin piece

572
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:17,240
if a cochlear bring back
that expression on your face

573
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,740
good

574
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,320
what expression?

575
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,200
joy

576
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,130
i was afraid if you
became a hearing person

577
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:42,160
you'd think of us differently

578
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:47,720
you'd be ashamed

579
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,650
never

580
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,320
no matter what you do

581
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,290
i want you to know...

582
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,590
don't get all mushy on me dad

583
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,580
always the wise-ass

584
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,550
So you let him go.

585
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,120
i had to let my child go

586
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,560
even if it meant losing him

587
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,510
So you knew he had an implant all along.

588
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,720
You thought he'd wait till
after christmas break to get it?

589
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,750
Thanks for your time.

590
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:04,690
Are you talking about
carlos,andy's best friend?

591
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,870
What about carlos?

592
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,420
"Carlos talked him into it"?

593
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,470
Are you saying carlos wanted
andy to get the implant?

594
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,620
That doesn't make sense.

595
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,610
carlos went with him

596
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,790
So leah was a freak
for getting an implant?

597
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,410
The same for andy,right?

598
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,480
I told him he shouldn't do it.

599
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,950
Really?

600
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,950
That's not what i heard.

601
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,990
You went with him.

602
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,370
Yeah,I did some digging,carlos.

603
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,460
You got tested,too,didn't you?

604
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,830
Wait,there must be a mistake.

605
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,700
Carlos is a well-adjusted
deaf young man.

606
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,030
When will you people learn?

607
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:04,350
People like carlos don't need
to do anything to fit in...

608
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,110
shut up

609
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,860
you want to say something,carlos?

610
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:26,870
"She doesn't know what it's like to
live in a world where you're a freak."

611
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,830
Carlos,no one thinks that.

612
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,730
So you wanted an implant,too.

613
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,370
But you weren't a good candidate,

614
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,910
because you were...born deaf.

615
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:53,940
It must have hurt to know andy was gonna
leave you behind for the hearing world.

616
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,710
Did you see him at the school?

617
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:17,120
- What's he saying?
- Please don't do this to him. Please.

618
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,320
No,come on,carlos.

619
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,080
Andy was all you had.

620
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:25,310
You were afraid of-of being
alone-- no more best buds.

621
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,790
Hey. look at me.

622
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,570
Look at me.

623
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,760
I know you can read my lips,carlos.

624
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,220
you found him,didn't you?

625
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,590
You saw him playing piano. Right?

626
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,640
Saw him hearing.

627
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,280
How'd that make you feel?

628
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,160
Where'd that leave you,carlos?

629
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,640
emma.
