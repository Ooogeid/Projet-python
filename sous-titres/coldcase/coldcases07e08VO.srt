1
00:00:25,848 --> 00:00:28,700
So, is that a maybe yes?

2
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,300
Or a maybe maybe?

3
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,501
It's a... maybe yes.

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,700
Maybe Friday night then?

5
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,700
We're not talking about when.

6
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,241
We're still on different types of maybes.

7
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:40,304
I've known you since I was 12.

8
00:00:40,314 --> 00:00:42,631
Maybe I can confuse you, speed things up a little bit.

9
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:43,874
Huh?

10
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:47,200
Don't kiss me so close to your father's store.

11
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,200
Don't worry. He's not the jealous type.

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,700
I know exactly what your father thinks of me.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,300
If my father knew you, he'd like
you even more than he likes me.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,294
You're just trying to change my "maybe yes" into a "yes yes."

15
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:01,119
Is it working?

16
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:04,187
I got to go.

17
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:05,711
They're starting without me.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,155
You coming tomorrow night?

19
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:08,980
You've been practicing all week.
I'm not going to miss it.

20
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,063
Okay.

21
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:12,800
Look out. Your cousin's coming.

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,999
Hey, Jack, I just won $20.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,299
They let you in the casino?

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,899
I was outside playing dice.

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,900
You're supposed to be watching your little sister.

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,400
Hey, watch where you're going.

27
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:29,400
Have a good day.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,300
Hey, pop.

29
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:36,800
Thank you.
This orange tree will bring us luck.

30
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:44,100
Why do you bother buying the tree?
Why don't you just give them the cash?

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,900
The tree brings us luck.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,900
It brings us flies.

33
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,000
You're already late.
Haven't you insulted me enough today?

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,300
Come on, I was kidding.

35
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:52,515
Dad.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,400
Hope you're kidding about that girl.

37
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,100
Dad finds out, he'll have a stroke.

38
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,000
What's he going to do when I marry her?

39
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,399
Don't talk about that. Marriage...

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,800
- is serious.
- Is serious.

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,199
You're a little punk.
You need to grow up.

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,800
Why, 'cause you make it seem like so much fun?

43
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,838
The usual, John.

44
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:37,200
Don't tell me.

45
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,300
Nobody saw anything and nobody knows nothing.

46
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,042
Nothing.

47
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,133
People call in sick all the time.

48
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,634
You see my other shoe?

49
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:04,935
You know, the boss don't care.

50
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:08,575
When's the last time you called in sick?

51
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:10,712
Oh, I don't know.

52
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:17,279
You know what?

53
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:18,818
He'll buy it.

54
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:23,322
Then what, just--
stay cooped up in here all day?

55
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:27,325
If you want to go out,
all you have to do is say the word.

56
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:30,463
Oh, got it.

57
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:33,031
Yeah, I can hear it in your voice.

58
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,867
You're definitely coming down with something.

59
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:38,702
Thanks, doc, but I--I got to go.

60
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:40,668
Duty calls.

61
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,634
Hey, hey, hey.

62
00:03:43,818 --> 00:03:45,944
Let me look at that face again.

63
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:56,792
Hey, boss, there's a woman here says her son Chao Lu...

64
00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:59,727
was shot and killed in '83. He's your case.

65
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:07,241
Jack Chao Lu.

66
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:08,256
Jack?

67
00:04:08,612 --> 00:04:10,587
A young kid in Chinatown

68
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:11,711
Gang-related.

69
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:12,973
She got something new?

70
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,579
Well, won't say till she talks to you.

71
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:21,220
Mrs. Lu, I'm Lieutenant Stillman.

72
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:23,603
Do you remember my son?

73
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:24,696
I do.

74
00:04:24,706 --> 00:04:26,009
I remember you as well.

75
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:29,726
Then I apologize for the last time we saw each other.

76
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:41,408
Mr. and Mrs. Lu, I know that this is a difficult time...

77
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:44,050
Leave us be.
We have nothing to tell you.

78
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,447
It's important I get information
about your son as soon as possible.

79
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:58,351
My husband wouldn't allow us to talk to the police.

80
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:00,128
I respected his wishes.

81
00:05:00,138 --> 00:05:01,793
Recently he passed away.

82
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:04,060
And now you want to talk?

83
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:08,661
Jack was not in a gang.

84
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,213
He was in love with this girl from Vietnam.

85
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:13,467
It was very shameful for both kinds.

86
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:14,545
Both kinds?

87
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:16,477
My husband and I are from China.

88
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:18,422
Her family are Chinese,

89
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:20,745
but they came from Vietnam. No good.

90
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:23,153
You think dating this girl got your son killed?

91
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:26,315
In our culture we take tradition very seriously.

92
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:29,082
Mrs. Lu, who else knew that Jack had a girlfriend?

93
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:30,850
I kept it a secret.

94
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:33,317
My husband was very traditional.

95
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,487
But for me, they were just kids in love.

96
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:38,114
What's the girl's name?

97
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,472
Tam Sung.

98
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:41,095
She was very beautiful.

99
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:42,005
Was?

100
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,630
She was shot and killed three
months before my son was murdered.

101
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:48,836
You thought-- Jack's murder was related to
another killing and,

102
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:51,815
you didn't say anything about it for-- 26 years?

103
00:05:51,825 --> 00:05:55,368
I know you don't understand, but I had no choice.

104
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:59,928
Mrs. Lu, this information would've
helped the investigation back then.

105
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:01,940
Am I too late, Lieutenant?

106
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:42,309
Jack Chao Lu, 17 years old.
Shot by a nine-millimeter.

107
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,659
Two in the back, one in the head, close range.

108
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:47,008
I see why you went with gang execution.

109
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:50,277
Chinese gangs were at war back then.
Lot of casualties.

110
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:52,545
This kid was a good student.
I couldn't find the connect.

111
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:54,048
Which gang came out on top?

112
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:55,139
Dragon Boys.

113
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:58,037
Gun-toting punks prided themselves on having no limits.

114
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,016
Extortion, kidnapping, murder....

115
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:01,308
Well, they still running things?

116
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:02,356
Far as I know.

117
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:05,044
Not much you can do when no one will cooperate or testify.

118
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:08,260
2,000 years of culture says,"Don't talk to police."

119
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,530
Hard to fight that.

120
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:13,907
We started hiring cops in the late '80s
that spoke Mandarin, some Cantonese.

121
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:16,455
I'll talk to the Asian Gang
Unit, see if we made any progress.

122
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:17,263
Hmm.

123
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:19,055
This the girl Jack was dating?

124
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:21,350
Tam Sung, 17.

125
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:23,365
Gang shootout during a street festival.

126
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,890
Caught in the cross-fire.

127
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:27,102
No witnesses, no leads?

128
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,014
Looked like a stray bullet.

129
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:30,951
Assigned didn't get much further than that.

130
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:33,233
Three months later, Jack winds up dead.

131
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:34,324
Rotten coincidence.

132
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:36,423
Compounded by Tam Sung's father.

133
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:38,831
Registered a gun in 1980.

134
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,636
Nine-millimeter.

135
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,030
Tam was my only girl.

136
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,821
She wanted to be a dancer.

137
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:46,514
Was she dating anyone?

138
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:48,992
No, she was too young.

139
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,455
But very beautiful.

140
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:55,157
I knew when she grew up, I'd be in trouble.

141
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,760
Still got that nine-millimeter you bought in 1980, Joe?

142
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:01,406
I don't understand.

143
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:04,725
Do you have new lead on who killed my Tam?

144
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,443
Answer the question, Mr. Sung.

145
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:09,438
I have the gun, locked up at home.

146
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,565
Mind if we take a ride with you to go get it?

147
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,867
What's going on?
Why did you bring me here?

148
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:16,633
You remember a kid named Jack Lu?

149
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:23,209
Do you think I would kill someone
else's child after losing my Tam?

150
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:25,266
I would never hurt this boy,

151
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:27,214
no matter what his family think.

152
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,057
How do you know what they think?

153
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,524
I had no problem with Jack, huh,

154
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:34,262
but his father looked down on my daughter.

155
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:35,781
So you knew she was seeing Jack?

156
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,715
I knew he was interested in her.

157
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,776
- After she died, did you confront him?
- No.

158
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,785
After the funeral, my wife and I went to Tianjin to be with family.

159
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:45,500
Gone six months. Look for yourself.

160
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,710
Don't worry. We will.

161
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,508
Good.

162
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,661
Then look into the murder of my daughter.

163
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,513
We are, but we need your help.

164
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:53,119
I can't help.

165
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:55,842
I was right there.

166
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:59,805
The shooting started, and
I couldn't do anything.

167
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:41,997
I'm here. You-you're Okay.

168
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,073
You're Okay.

169
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,376
No...

170
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:49,914
No, no.

171
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:51,423
God, no.

172
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,168
- We got to get out of here.
- Go without me.

173
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:56,637
- The police are coming.
- I saw 'em--

174
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:58,629
three guys with masks, dragon tattoos.

175
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,274
One of them had an Uzi.
We've got to tell somebody.

176
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:02,646
- Keep your mouth shut.
- We got to tell somebody.

177
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:04,773
No, keep your mouth shut.
Get up. Come on. Let's go.

178
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:07,240
Get up. Get up. Let's go.

179
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:13,175
I didn't know how much he loved her.

180
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:14,742
Those tattoos--

181
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:17,165
it was the Dragon Boys did the shooting?

182
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:20,327
I didn't see, but we all knew.

183
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:23,838
After the shooting, did Jack mention going to the police?

184
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:25,859
We never spoke again.

185
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:31,033
I saw him at Tam's funeral, but
I was too upset to reach out.

186
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,229
Wish I had.

187
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:36,613
All right, call me back. Bye.

188
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,397
Thinking Jack might have reached out
to the police about Tam's murder.

189
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:46,778
Ray Bianchi, worked the Chinatown narcotics unit back then, said he'd never heard of the kid.

190
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,715
I'll run Jack's name through NCIC, see if anything pops.

191
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,743
Yeah, the Chinese go to the tong
with problems, not the department.

192
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:53,533
The tong?

193
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:56,752
Local Chinese merchants, lot of money, power.

194
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:59,099
Fund the Chinese Trade Alliance.

195
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:03,370
The CTA gives out scholarships,
helps immigrants get jobs, loans.

196
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,729
Sounds good.

197
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:06,139
What am I missing?

198
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,862
Well, Kim Sing tong also controls the Dragon Boys.

199
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:11,203
Money from the heroin trade.

200
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,078
Gang moves the drugs, runs the brothels, casinos.

201
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:16,291
The tong gets rich, but never gets their hands dirty.

202
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,267
So, a bunch of old businessmen control the gangs?

203
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:21,238
Tong's like Chinese Mob.

204
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,678
Only harder to crack.

205
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:25,613
The tong never deals directly with the gangs.

206
00:11:25,623 --> 00:11:28,924
Always through a go-between Chinese call the Dai Lo.

207
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:33,297
Department can't touch the tong 'cause--
we never knew who the Dai Lo was.

208
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:34,539
Yeah, we still don't.

209
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:37,653
It took 26 years for Jack's mother to come forward.

210
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:39,823
Let's find out what the brother knows.

211
00:11:47,502 --> 00:11:50,693
Detectives Rush, Valens, Homicide.

212
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:52,668
I'll be right with you, Detectives.

213
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:56,973
You don't need to close.
We just want to ask you a few questions.

214
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,960
It'll be easier to talk without customers coming in and out.

215
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,150
Please.

216
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,598
You know your brother had a girlfriend?

217
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:07,659
I was with him when Tam got killed.

218
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:12,466
I had no idea my mother knew about her until
she said she was going to the police yesterday.

219
00:12:12,476 --> 00:12:14,872
You don't think she should help find your brother's killer?

220
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:18,536
You don't understand.
My father didn't want us talking to the police.

221
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:20,005
Well, you're right. We don't understand.

222
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:21,360
Think you'd want justice.

223
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,761
American justice doesn't work for people in Chinatown.

224
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:27,511
Well, it definitely won't if you don't
tell us what's going on; that's for sure.

225
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:30,651
All right. Say I get robbed
and I tell you who did it.

226
00:12:30,661 --> 00:12:34,286
You arrest them; they get out
on bail and burn down my store.

227
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:37,352
Who pays to rebuild?
Not the police.

228
00:12:37,362 --> 00:12:40,000
Jack feel the same as you-- about talking to cops?

229
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,928
Jack thought he was American, not Chinese.

230
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:44,445
I'm getting the impression you two didn't get along.

231
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:48,741
We were different, but I loved my brother.

232
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:51,303
Wish I'd tried to understand him when I had the chance.

233
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,449
Did Jack say he knew who killed Tam?

234
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:55,774
He thought it was the Dragon Boys.

235
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,873
Didn't know which one so he was angry at them all.

236
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:03,386
Thank you. This tree will bring us much luck.

237
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:08,159
We don't want your orange tree.

238
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:11,199
Your pop already paid me.

239
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,400
See you next week.

240
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,392
I said we don't want the stupid tree!

241
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,752
You're kidding, right?

242
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:18,055
- Jack!
- I apologize for my son.

243
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:20,280
We're not paying for your junk anymore!

244
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:27,513
What's going on here?

245
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:30,872
Bo-Lin, we are fortunate you came when you did.

246
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:32,886
My son thanks you.

247
00:13:40,849 --> 00:13:43,037
Jack could've got us all killed.

248
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:44,293
You know who the thug was?

249
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:47,261
Dragon Boy named Danny Yo.
Long dead.

250
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:51,037
Who's this Bo-Lin?
Sounds like Danny Yo was terrified of him.

251
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,920
Terror is different than respect.

252
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,555
Bo-Lin Chen is a very respected man around here.

253
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:00,065
CTA.
Chinese Trade Alliance.

254
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:02,339
That's right. My father was a businessman.

255
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,334
Jack have a problem with Bo-Lin Chen?

256
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:08,359
No, I don't think so.
Bo-Lin was a great friend to our family.

257
00:14:08,484 --> 00:14:12,353
Do you have any chrysanthemum tea here?
I look for it everywhere.

258
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:17,192
We ran out. Um, just ordered some more.
Try the jasmine.

259
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:20,266
Hey, you knew Jack Lu?

260
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,353
He's my cousin.

261
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,339
Guess I'll just have to come back then.

262
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:46,592
Danny Yo was shot and killed in 1985.
No witnesses.

263
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:48,259
No leads.

264
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,990
But he was bailed out three times.

265
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,687
Bail slip always signed by Mr. Bo-Lin Chen.

266
00:14:56,408 --> 00:15:00,672
Ling didn't say Mr. Do-gooder was
involved with a thug like Danny Yo.

267
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:04,694
Could be scared of him.
Today Chen is the president of the CTA.

268
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,697
But back in '83, he was on the front lines.

269
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:11,751
Racketeering, heroin trafficking...
charges all dropped.

270
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:16,550
Witnesses never made it to trial.
Two to the body, one to the head.

271
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:18,424
Just like Jack.

272
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:23,123
Bo-Lin was the connect between the tong and the gang.

273
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:26,299
Looks like we found our Dai Lo.

274
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:51,660
Detectives, how can I help you?

275
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:54,622
Jack Chao Lu.
You remember him?

276
00:15:54,632 --> 00:15:57,668
Hmm, yes, of course.
Hong Lu's son.

277
00:15:57,678 --> 00:16:00,338
Got killed by street gangs, I think.
Very tragic.

278
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:03,339
We're looking at the Dragon Boys.
I'm sure you're familiar.

279
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:06,461
Gangs are horrible for Chinatown.
I've always tried to get rid of them.

280
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:08,595
That why your name is on a dozen of their bail slips?

281
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:12,280
Putting bangers back on the street
your idea of cleaning up Chinatown.

282
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:15,347
No, you misunderstand.

283
00:16:15,455 --> 00:16:20,767
I run the CTA scholarship fund.
We try to help children who lost their way.

284
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:24,627
All right, drop the act, Bo-Lin.
We know that you were the Dai Lo back in 1983.

285
00:16:24,637 --> 00:16:26,297
If Jack was targeted it went from you.

286
00:16:26,307 --> 00:16:30,068
I'm just a local businessman.
I want to help, but I don't know anything.

287
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,471
Just tell us who had a problem with Jack.
We'll leave you alone.

288
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:35,672
Otherwise we gotta start looking into your affairs.

289
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:37,975
It's your time to waste, Detective.

290
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,478
I've been a friend to the department for many years.

291
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:42,881
That's what you'll find.

292
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:44,715
This ain't going away, friend.

293
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:47,814
Have a nice day, Detectives.

294
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,431
Yeah, I'm looking for Emil Parker.

295
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:03,834
Okay, do you have his new number?

296
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,460
Look, he's not in any trouble. I just need to
talk to him about something he saw at the--

297
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,291
Dayley's parking lot.

298
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:11,696
Ma'am? Hello?

299
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:14,644
Uh, who's printing five trees of paper?

300
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,914
What are you looking for?

301
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:19,697
"Chapter 2. Some elevator repairman
found her rolled up in an old throw rug,

302
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,964
"fair-skinned and raven-haired."
Is that yours?

303
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,886
What a man prints is his own business.

304
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:26,422
Oh, sorry, just trying to do a little police business.

305
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:27,665
What'd you find?

306
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:29,761
Jack talked to a cop after all.

307
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:33,025
Two months before he died someone
logged him in as a ped stop.

308
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:34,098
Who?

309
00:17:34,277 --> 00:17:37,636
I'm trying to print that out,
but now it's in all this mess.

310
00:17:41,908 --> 00:17:44,319
Ray Bianchi, narcotics.

311
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:48,177
Didn't-- Boss say he asked Bianchi
about Jack back in the day?

312
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:50,546
- Said he'd never heard of the kid.
- Aw.

313
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:54,995
I'm sorry, John. I want to help, but, uh,

314
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:56,991
that was 26 years ago.

315
00:17:57,001 --> 00:18:01,293
All right, let me refresh your memory.
Jack Chao Lu.

316
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:04,560
You stopped him outside the 10th Street casino.

317
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,060
June 15, 1983.

318
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:13,663
You know how many Chinese kids
I stopped outside that casino? Come on.

319
00:18:13,673 --> 00:18:16,697
Back then you and me both had a seat
at Jimmy's Thursday night game,

320
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:18,474
seven-card stud. Remember that?

321
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:21,278
Of course, ti-till the wife shut it down.

322
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:24,783
One night at the table I asked you.
You said you never heard of him.

323
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:30,555
If that's what I said, then-- I guess I had my reasons.

324
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:32,929
I was working a homicide, Ray.

325
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:44,498
Okay, look. I was on a joint task force with the Feds.

326
00:18:44,508 --> 00:18:47,103
Heroin trafficking. It was big.

327
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:51,095
I beat my head against the wall on this case.
It was cold before the kid was in the ground.

328
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:54,378
Believe me, anything I had on him wouldn't have helped you.

329
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:56,078
That was my call to make, not yours.

330
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:57,356
I'm sorry, John.

331
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:00,550
I couldn't out myself even after the kid got killed.

332
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,623
He was an informant?

333
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:05,367
No, he was just a young kid-- looking for revenge.

334
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:29,692
Move out.

335
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,152
You, drop the knife.

336
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,638
Get up.

337
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:44,112
You are one dumb kid.

338
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:46,771
They had guns and you arrest me for a knife?

339
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:49,374
I am not arresting you.
I'm saving your ass.

340
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:50,453
What the hell were you thinking?

341
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:52,303
Just want to know which one of them did it.

342
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:53,108
Did what, kid?

343
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:54,480
My girl got shot.

344
00:19:56,048 --> 00:19:57,294
And nobody cares.

345
00:19:57,304 --> 00:20:00,223
Going after some Dragon Boy won't make a difference.

346
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:03,509
You're just like the rest of them.
You accept it's how it is, and you don't do anything.

347
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,252
No, the department is going after
the guys that run the street gangs.

348
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:11,557
The heroin smugglers.
And you, I want you to stay away from those thugs.

349
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:12,732
You hear me?

350
00:20:12,742 --> 00:20:14,902
Then tell me what to do.

351
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:16,764
I gotta do something.

352
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:21,425
Had a flophouse out in Fairhill.

353
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:25,007
Paid the kid a few bucks to come
out once a week and translate tapes.

354
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:26,378
God knows we needed the help.

355
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:29,272
The Feds had translators.
You didn't need to get Jack involved.

356
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:31,676
One guy spoke Cantonese.

357
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:33,985
Came down from New York twice a month.

358
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:35,907
What was on those tapes?

359
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:39,539
Not much.
Couple small drug busts, that's it.

360
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:41,398
I want the transcripts.

361
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:45,279
Feds got that stuff, if they even still have it.

362
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,940
Call who you gotta call.

363
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:57,689
Where are we?

364
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,450
I got all day.

365
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:07,235
Uh, I'll call you back.

366
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:08,758
Detective Rush?

367
00:21:09,414 --> 00:21:11,054
I brought you that tea that you like.

368
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:12,147
Well, thank you.

369
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:14,362
Here, have a seat.

370
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:19,152
Is there a place we could, uh-- talk?

371
00:21:20,985 --> 00:21:23,755
I'm gonna make some of this tea.
Want some?

372
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:33,132
I worked at Hong Sheng Long since I was a kid.

373
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:36,139
Stock shelves, deliveries, whatever they need.

374
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:38,517
It sounds like you gave your life to that store.

375
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,814
I owe them at least that much.

376
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:43,110
Why's that, Warren?

377
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,313
You know, coming in here took courage.

378
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:50,447
No.

379
00:21:50,818 --> 00:21:52,786
I'm not that kind of person.

380
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:54,208
You're here, aren't you?

381
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:59,082
I used to want to be like the Dragon Boys.

382
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,397
You know, not afraid of anything.

383
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:06,701
But it was Jack who had the real courage, not me.

384
00:22:09,352 --> 00:22:11,869
They took Stacey, Jack.
I couldn't stop 'em. They had guns.

385
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:13,333
Calm down. Just tell me what happened.

386
00:22:13,343 --> 00:22:17,006
Supposed to watch my sister so I figured I'd take
her to the arcade, just-just for a little while...

387
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:17,941
Which arcade?

388
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,676
One near the Tenth Street casino.

389
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,415
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I screwed up!

390
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,911
Bunch of Dragon Boys-- they told me--
told me to bring money to this address.

391
00:22:25,918 --> 00:22:27,618
They're going to kill Stacey.

392
00:22:27,684 --> 00:22:29,786
- Just let me think.
- What am I going to do?

393
00:22:29,796 --> 00:22:31,520
All they want is the money.
They're gonna give her back.

394
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,560
Said they want $360 for luck.

395
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:41,996
Warren, look at me.

396
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:44,435
Go home, Okay?
I'll try to bring her back to you.

397
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:50,872
A van-- dropped off Stacey few hours later.

398
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:52,302
Then what happened to Jack?

399
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:54,679
I found out the next day he was dead.

400
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:56,812
You ask Stacey what she saw?

401
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:58,977
She didn't talk for a week.

402
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:03,604
Made her promise not to tell anyone what happened.

403
00:23:03,823 --> 00:23:05,522
She never trusted me again.

404
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:06,863
We'll need to talk to Stacey.

405
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:10,326
We don't talk anymore.
She never comes back to visit.

406
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:16,246
If I could just go back-- I would
have brought the money myself.

407
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:31,028
Hey, gorgeous.

408
00:23:31,487 --> 00:23:34,570
What's that you said, I never take you out?

409
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,120
No. Not like that.

410
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,539
What's the matter?
You don't like Italian?

411
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,893
Food or the car?

412
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,094
I know this great little place down the Shore. Come on.

413
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,264
The Shore?

414
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:51,568
How fast is that car?

415
00:23:51,578 --> 00:23:54,271
I'll get you home before sunup.

416
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,036
Haven't done this in a while.

417
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:07,969
What, skeeball or the go-carts?

418
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,442
- Watch the sun come up.
- Oh, yeah.

419
00:24:11,745 --> 00:24:13,179
It's good.

420
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,415
I'm sorry I got us kicked out back there.

421
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:19,139
You ran a ten-year-old kid off the track.

422
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:20,254
Hey, him or me.

423
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:22,789
Yeah, well, punk tried to box me in.

424
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,312
Should see me on the bumper cars.

425
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:29,819
So the wine, the food...

426
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,930
the Maserati?

427
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:36,800
Then what, you don't think I can rock that?

428
00:24:36,905 --> 00:24:38,505
I know what you make.

429
00:24:38,706 --> 00:24:40,573
Gotta play the part sometimes.

430
00:24:40,683 --> 00:24:43,204
I thought you might get a kick out of it.

431
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:44,706
Oh, no, I did.

432
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:46,825
It was fun.

433
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:48,113
Thanks.

434
00:24:48,392 --> 00:24:51,647
Figured diamond studs might seem
a little too forward, you know.

435
00:24:51,654 --> 00:24:54,132
Oh, yeah, this is much more subtle. Hm.

436
00:24:54,257 --> 00:24:55,700
It's not a rental.

437
00:24:57,756 --> 00:25:00,461
Figured since you're my girl and all.

438
00:25:04,418 --> 00:25:06,366
It's-it's beautiful.

439
00:25:07,553 --> 00:25:09,999
Um, I can't wear this around.

440
00:25:10,035 --> 00:25:11,502
Not on my salary.

441
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:14,187
Hold on to it till the next time we go out.

442
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:18,310
Let me guess.
No returns or exchanges?

443
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:21,108
You don't like it?

444
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:23,209
No, I-I didn't say that.

445
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,210
Just don't throw it in the Schuylkill.

446
00:25:27,904 --> 00:25:28,969
Hey.

447
00:25:32,138 --> 00:25:33,477
Thank you.

448
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:43,512
- But... what?
- You lied.

449
00:25:43,946 --> 00:25:47,514
Said you'd get me back before sunup. Come on.

450
00:25:56,378 --> 00:25:59,029
You don't mind, I'll give that
back to you when we're done here.

451
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,638
I don't mean to be rude, but I've
got a condo showing at 11:00...

452
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:05,418
When was the last time you saw your cousin Jack Lu?

453
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:08,215
I'm not sure.
He died when I was just a little kid.

454
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:10,217
You remember being kidnapped?

455
00:26:11,797 --> 00:26:14,078
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.

456
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:17,222
Your brother said Jack went off to pay your ransom.

457
00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:20,023
You came home a few hours later, but he never did.

458
00:26:21,525 --> 00:26:23,204
Warren said that?

459
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,319
He wants to help us find out what happened to Jack.

460
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:39,071
Listen, maybe I went missing a few
hours, but I don't remember specifics.

461
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:41,419
Anything you saw or heard could be helpful.

462
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:43,235
I was six years old.

463
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:45,930
I'm sorry. May I have my phone back now? I...

464
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:48,797
When I was five I was playing outside.

465
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:53,233
Neighbor's father had a heart attack, right in front of me.

466
00:26:53,334 --> 00:26:56,534
I remember the sound when his head hit pavement.

467
00:26:56,535 --> 00:27:00,235
I can still see his mail blowing into the street.

468
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:02,036
I remember everything.

469
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:04,351
I was five.

470
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:06,170
Jack saved your life.

471
00:27:06,327 --> 00:27:09,139
Don't you think you owe him anything for that?

472
00:27:11,681 --> 00:27:14,200
There was this...

473
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:16,754
dripping pipe.

474
00:27:18,242 --> 00:27:20,953
I'll never forget that pipe.

475
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,692
Cut it out, stupid.

476
00:27:38,216 --> 00:27:41,517
Don't hurt her. I got the lucky money. $360.

477
00:27:41,518 --> 00:27:42,918
Hand it over.

478
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:45,534
I'd be honored to give it to Mr. Bo-Lin Chen myself.

479
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:46,818
Just give it to me.

480
00:27:46,918 --> 00:27:50,019
Please, I just want to talk to Mr.
Bo-Lin Chen. I'll cause no trouble.

481
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,420
Mr. Bo-Lin Chen, huh?

482
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:53,121
Stand still.

483
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,423
You're gonna get your wish.

484
00:28:03,424 --> 00:28:05,924
Bo-Lin will be the last person you ever see.

485
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,325
Let's go.

486
00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:16,626
Some guy brought me home.

487
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:19,583
Spent the rest of my life trying to erase it.

488
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:21,661
You know where you were?

489
00:28:21,671 --> 00:28:24,039
Think it was underneath Shah-Lo Restaurant.

490
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,881
Saw a bunch of take-out boxes and stuff like that.

491
00:28:26,891 --> 00:28:29,231
But they took him somewhere else.

492
00:28:29,432 --> 00:28:30,932
To see Bo-Lin Chen.

493
00:28:31,254 --> 00:28:33,194
I don't know where.

494
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:36,734
But I never saw Jack again.

495
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:44,036
- What can I do for you, Detectives?
- You can sit down.

496
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:45,523
Sure.

497
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:49,337
You own the Shah-Lo Restaurant, Mr. Chen?

498
00:28:49,838 --> 00:28:52,138
I have many business interests.

499
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:53,739
Like kidnapping for ransom?

500
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:54,950
Is this some kind of joke?

501
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,642
In 1983 a little girl was held against her
will in the basement of your restaurant.

502
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:00,643
That never happened.

503
00:29:00,644 --> 00:29:02,822
Well, she remembers it pretty good.
Knows your name.

504
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:04,745
Lots of people know my name.

505
00:29:04,755 --> 00:29:09,047
If she saw me commit such a horrible
crime, you should arrest me.

506
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:10,816
No?

507
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:13,822
I didn't think so.

508
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:16,419
- I'd like to leave now.
- Take a seat.

509
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:22,433
Just need to confirm the last time you saw Jack Chao Lu.

510
00:29:23,143 --> 00:29:25,051
Already told the lieutenant.

511
00:29:25,052 --> 00:29:29,253
I want to help your investigation,
but I don't see how I can.

512
00:29:29,254 --> 00:29:30,754
Well, stop jerking us around, for one.

513
00:29:30,764 --> 00:29:34,491
What'd you call yourself last time we talked?
Friend to the department?

514
00:29:34,764 --> 00:29:36,295
That's a joke.

515
00:29:36,305 --> 00:29:38,958
I serve as a liaison.

516
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:44,715
Long as the tourists are safe the police
don't care about the people in Chinatown.

517
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:45,736
Oh, and you do?

518
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,878
They come to me when they need help.

519
00:29:48,004 --> 00:29:50,215
No, you threaten them so they won't talk to us.

520
00:29:50,225 --> 00:29:53,264
Exploit them in sweatshops, casinos, brothels.

521
00:29:53,265 --> 00:29:54,345
That all ends today.

522
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:55,619
What are you talking about?

523
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:57,045
We're shutting it all down.

524
00:29:57,055 --> 00:30:00,768
Not mine, but what's the point?
You shut 'em down. Other ones pop up.

525
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:04,198
Maybe. But between now and then
you'll lose a lot of money.

526
00:30:08,678 --> 00:30:12,093
I tell you what I know,
you leave Chinatown alone?

527
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:15,815
August 12, 1983. Jack Chao Lu.

528
00:30:17,973 --> 00:30:22,926
Jack grew up in Chinatown, but
didn't understand how it works.

529
00:30:22,936 --> 00:30:24,954
I just tried to put some sense to him.

530
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:38,076
Look, don't hurt Stacey Lee, please,
all right. I've got your money.

531
00:30:39,912 --> 00:30:41,662
There's been some misunderstanding.

532
00:30:42,678 --> 00:30:46,078
But I appreciate this token of your respect.

533
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,339
What is this about?

534
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:56,680
- You cooperate with police?
- I know what you are.

535
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,781
I'm a businessman.
And friend of your father's.

536
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:07,182
He'd be so ashamed if he saw how you
speak to me, with such disrespect.

537
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:10,584
Businessman, my ass. You smile in our face. You stab us in the back.

538
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:13,085
No, no, no, no, no.
You got it wrong, son.

539
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:17,777
You want criminal, look at your cop friend.

540
00:31:17,787 --> 00:31:20,831
He's too busy lining his pockets
with my money to arrest anyone.

541
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:22,090
That's not true.

542
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:24,591
You've got a lot to learn about the world.

543
00:31:37,214 --> 00:31:39,684
Jack left angry, but he was alive.

544
00:31:39,694 --> 00:31:40,483
Angry with you.

545
00:31:40,493 --> 00:31:42,695
With the police department, of course.

546
00:31:42,696 --> 00:31:43,669
They let him down.

547
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,197
You're the one who buys cops.

548
00:31:45,198 --> 00:31:49,199
It's not bribery if the cop takes the money. It's extortion.

549
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,511
I'm the victim here.

550
00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:53,401
Then file a complaint.
Give us the cop's name.

551
00:31:53,402 --> 00:31:55,493
I can't do that. I'm being extorted,

552
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,429
afraid for my life and so on.

553
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:02,490
You seem to be smart.

554
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:04,590
You'll figure it out.

555
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:13,031
Anything on Bianchi?

556
00:32:13,508 --> 00:32:15,808
Found some financial discrepancies.

557
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,209
All three of his kids went to private colleges.

558
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:22,810
On full scholarships paid for by
dummy corporations, foundations.

559
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:24,811
Traced back to the CTA.

560
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:26,699
Maybe Jack confronted Bianchi.

561
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:28,612
Had a lot to lose.

562
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,513
Pension, for sure, probably jail time.

563
00:32:31,523 --> 00:32:32,713
Get him in here.

564
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:44,915
CTA scholarships are the tip of the iceberg, Ray.

565
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,216
We're going through your tax
returns and bank statements now.

566
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:49,017
I'm retired, John.

567
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:51,618
You're going to call the rat
squad without even talking to me?

568
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:54,920
They even think you got a kid's murder on your hands.
Bribery's the least of your problems.

569
00:32:55,797 --> 00:32:59,621
You know me 30 years.
You got to know I would never hurt that kid.

570
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:01,622
You gave his name to Bo-Lin Chen.
What do you call that?

571
00:33:01,623 --> 00:33:04,823
No. No way. That kid didn't need
no help to get himself into trouble.

572
00:33:04,824 --> 00:33:05,824
I was in a tough spot.

573
00:33:05,825 --> 00:33:08,324
You put yourself in a tough spot
when you took money from Bo-Lin.

574
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:11,626
We make deals, John.
It's how Chinatown works.

575
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:13,988
We got to take the gifts,
or the Tong won't even talk to us.

576
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:15,034
Don't say "we."

577
00:33:15,124 --> 00:33:19,529
Fine. I got Bo-Lin to stop
the gang shoot-outs over turf.

578
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,592
In exchange for what?

579
00:33:20,602 --> 00:33:23,030
Letting him smuggle drugs,
run brothels and casinos?

580
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:24,331
What was I supposed to do?

581
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,232
Let tourists get killed while they're
eating their sweet and sour chicken?

582
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:30,233
Jack Lu reached out to the department for help, Ray.

583
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:32,411
He went against what everybody told him,

584
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:34,897
and he trusted a cop. He trusted you.

585
00:33:36,071 --> 00:33:37,936
What do you want from me?

586
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,409
Start with the truth.

587
00:33:45,613 --> 00:33:47,438
I can't give you Bo-Lin.

588
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:49,272
Do you have proof that he's the doer?

589
00:33:49,282 --> 00:33:51,641
No. There's not gonna be none.

590
00:33:51,642 --> 00:33:54,142
He never got within a foot of the really dirty work.

591
00:33:54,152 --> 00:33:55,640
Then it's on you.

592
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:02,911
I couldn't protect that kid.

593
00:34:03,485 --> 00:34:06,300
He had his own set of keys to the flophouse.

594
00:34:11,193 --> 00:34:12,746
Hey, kid.

595
00:34:12,747 --> 00:34:14,547
What you doing here?
It ain't Thursday.

596
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:18,273
What's up?

597
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:20,050
I just want to know one thing.

598
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,986
Do you know who killed Tam?
Have you known all along?

599
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:26,146
Hey. What's wrong?

600
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:27,868
Answer my question.

601
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:33,554
There were rival tongs.
One shoots up the other's festival over turf.

602
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:34,445
All right?

603
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:37,053
No, you got to let it go.

604
00:34:37,464 --> 00:34:39,454
That's why you're going after the heroin smugglers, right?

605
00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:42,054
Bo-Lin Chen. So you can stop that kind of violence?

606
00:34:42,055 --> 00:34:46,056
Look, I told you we're gonna get those
guys, but first, we got to build a case.

607
00:34:46,057 --> 00:34:50,057
How you gonna do that when Bo-Lin Chen is paying
you to make sure he doesn't get arrested?

608
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,358
Who told you that?

609
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:58,359
No wonder everything's so messed up around here.

610
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,160
Good guys are the same as the bad guys.

611
00:35:06,055 --> 00:35:08,161
Went in the room, and...

612
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:11,440
whole place was torn apart.

613
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:14,474
Jack got the other tapes.

614
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,333
What other tapes?

615
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,565
I held back the ones with Bo-Lin's voice on them.

616
00:35:23,566 --> 00:35:27,434
It was my insurance policy.
Jack got 'em all.

617
00:35:27,444 --> 00:35:29,168
- And where are they now?
- Gone.

618
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,769
Bo-Lin probably destroyed them
when he took Jack out.

619
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,871
You could have made a case against Bo-Lin
with everything you saw and did, Ray.

620
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:37,272
It doesn't matter.

621
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:39,173
It's the tong.

622
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:42,674
You cu-You cut off one head of the
dragon, the other one grows back.

623
00:35:42,675 --> 00:35:45,075
Then you go after that one, and
you go after the one after that.

624
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:48,777
You get the guy that did the crime, Ray.
That's the job.

625
00:35:56,725 --> 00:35:58,977
I'm gonna need that phone now.

626
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:01,078
Call my delegate.

627
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:03,979
You might want to call your wife first.

628
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,681
If Jack went back to Bo-Lin,
he'd destroy those tapes.

629
00:36:17,782 --> 00:36:19,578
Not to mention Jack.

630
00:36:20,617 --> 00:36:22,749
Unless the kid got smarter than that.

631
00:36:44,097 --> 00:36:45,409
I can't listen anymore.

632
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:47,576
It's important you ID the voices.

633
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:50,515
Please don't ask me to do this.

634
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:56,408
Mrs. Lu,

635
00:36:58,493 --> 00:37:01,600
your son Jack was very brave.

636
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,222
Honorable.

637
00:37:04,627 --> 00:37:06,623
He deserves better.

638
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:08,371
Justice.

639
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:12,525
One of them is Bo-Lin Chen.

640
00:37:12,535 --> 00:37:14,412
And the other voice?

641
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:18,266
Ling, my eldest son,

642
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:21,874
selling his soul to the devil.

643
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:30,319
Hong Sheng Long Market has two trucks.

644
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,220
Can easily move shipments without being stopped.

645
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,121
What about your father?
He's not the type that can be bought.

646
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:40,222
Don't worry about him.
He trusts what I say.

647
00:37:41,056 --> 00:37:42,623
He'll never know.

648
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,120
Anything you need.

649
00:37:54,203 --> 00:37:57,620
I'm sorry, Detectives.
I don't recognize either of the voices.

650
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,322
Oh, it's you and Bo-Lin.

651
00:38:00,323 --> 00:38:01,823
No, no, you're mistaken.

652
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:04,770
Your brother found this tape.
Probably listened to the whole thing.

653
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,025
If I was him, I'd be pretty
disappointed in my older brother.

654
00:38:08,026 --> 00:38:10,798
He was a naive little kid.
Didn't know anything about responsibility.

655
00:38:10,808 --> 00:38:13,227
He cared about doing the right thing.

656
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,228
Doesn't count in your book?

657
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:16,929
Jack just cared about himself.

658
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,030
In our culture, we honor and
protect our family above all else.

659
00:38:21,183 --> 00:38:23,129
Think your mother felt the same way.

660
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:26,921
Excuse me?

661
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:30,934
Well, you said that you weren't
on the tape, but she heard it.

662
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,071
Told us herself.

663
00:38:32,081 --> 00:38:34,836
Well, I think a mother recognizes her own son.

664
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,433
Is she here?

665
00:38:41,896 --> 00:38:44,066
No, she's gone home.

666
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:47,132
But she did want us to give you this.

667
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,972
What's it say?

668
00:38:57,447 --> 00:39:00,583
"You have brought shame to your father,

669
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:04,221
"and to our family name."

670
00:39:06,684 --> 00:39:09,126
That's why you had to stop Jack.

671
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,751
He never understood.

672
00:39:13,515 --> 00:39:14,662
He never understood.

673
00:39:14,672 --> 00:39:16,029
Jack never understood.

674
00:39:25,523 --> 00:39:26,615
What are you doing here?

675
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:30,337
You're using Dad's trucks to ship heroin.
I know when and where.

676
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:34,158
I'm just making a little extra money for the store.

677
00:39:34,168 --> 00:39:35,208
So Dad knows?

678
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:38,734
We already pay hundreds of dollars a week to those punks.

679
00:39:38,735 --> 00:39:40,235
Why shouldn't we get a piece of the pie?

680
00:39:40,236 --> 00:39:42,236
Because they're lowlife criminals, and we're not.

681
00:39:42,237 --> 00:39:46,138
Bo-Lin Chen asked for my help,
and is very generous in exchange.

682
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:48,439
I can't believe you'd touch money from his pockets.

683
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,140
You're a ridiculous little child.

684
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:53,541
I'd be a sucker if I didn't take an opportunity
handed to me on a silver platter.

685
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:55,242
So, Dad's a sucker?

686
00:39:57,601 --> 00:40:02,544
He's very traditional, and there's no point
getting him confused with more business affairs.

687
00:40:02,545 --> 00:40:03,661
I'm taking over the store.

688
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:04,636
Not yet, you're not.

689
00:40:04,646 --> 00:40:05,690
Just leave this alone.

690
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,248
Everybody around here wants to leave it alone.
That's why nothing ever changes.

691
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:10,449
What do you want to change, Jack?

692
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:14,151
Your buddy Bo-Lin ordered the Dragon
Boys to shoot up the summer festival.

693
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:17,251
He didn't care who got hurt.
I'm going to make him care.

694
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,324
You've lost your mind, little brother.

695
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,182
Not me, Ling.

696
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,032
They killed my Tam, and I got proof.

697
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:28,333
Where are you going?

698
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,734
Wait.

699
00:40:30,092 --> 00:40:33,135
Jack, you're not going to tell Dad about the truck?

700
00:40:33,336 --> 00:40:34,736
You did this to yourself.

701
00:40:34,737 --> 00:40:37,537
He'll disown me. You know that.

702
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:39,038
You're not my brother.

703
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,339
Stop!

704
00:40:45,481 --> 00:40:47,203
Jack!

705
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,540
Stop!

706
00:40:51,194 --> 00:40:52,506
Jack!

# "Every breath you take" by The Police #

708
00:41:23,738 --> 00:41:27,138
# Every breath you take #

709
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:31,439
# And every move you make #

710
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:36,341
# Every bond you break, every step you take #

711
00:41:36,342 --> 00:41:38,842
# I'll be watching you #

712
00:41:40,243 --> 00:41:43,943
# Every single day #

713
00:41:44,444 --> 00:41:47,744
# And every word you say #

714
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:52,446
# Every game you play, every night you stay #

715
00:41:52,447 --> 00:41:54,947
# I'll be watching you #

716
00:41:56,848 --> 00:42:00,148
# Oh, can't you see #

717
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:04,149
# You belong to me? #

718
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,450
# Now, my poor heart aches #

719
00:42:08,851 --> 00:42:11,951
# With every step you take #

720
00:42:12,952 --> 00:42:16,352
# Every move you make #

721
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:20,253
# Every vow you break #

722
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:25,355
# Every smile you fake, every claim you stake #

723
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:27,856
# I'll be watching you #

724
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:35,358
# Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace #

725
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,359
# I dream at night, I can only see your face #

726
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,560
# I look around, but it's you I can't replace #

727
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,661
# I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace #

728
00:42:47,662 --> 00:42:53,962
# I keep crying, baby, baby, please #

729
00:43:10,363 --> 00:43:13,963
# Oh, can't you see #

730
00:43:14,664 --> 00:43:17,964
# You belong to me? #

731
00:43:18,565 --> 00:43:22,265
# Now, my poor heart aches... #

732
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,766
# Every step you take #

733
00:43:26,767 --> 00:43:30,167
# Every move you make #

734
00:43:30,768 --> 00:43:33,968
# Every vow you break #

735
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:37,469
# I'll be watching you #
