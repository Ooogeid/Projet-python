<i>"You Really Got Me"
by The Kinks.</i>

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,100
Lana !

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,400
You're supposed
to be helping.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,600
Sorry, Mir, I forgot I, uh,
left it on there.

6
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:15,101
Here.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,600
Pass the Li'l Smokies.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,600
Are you sure
this barf is edible ?

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,800
Make sure the Jell-O salads
aren't wilting.

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,500
As I was saying,

11
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,900
when Violet told me she had
the solution to my kitchen woes,

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,900
I thought she'd found a way

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,300
to get my husband home
on time for dinner.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
Products are good,
but they're not that good.

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,900
These are kosher, right ?

16
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,200
What's unique
is the little "burp."

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,400
It's the signature sound.

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,800
The sound of freshness.

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,100
I use this one,
the Freeze-It,

20
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,600
- to store dozens of meals.
- She isn't kiddin', ladies.

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,400
I'll bet she hasn't cooked
in a week.

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,200
Honestly, I had no idea my life
could change so quickly.

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,800
But everything's in the catalog.

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,200
Phone me if you have questions.

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,000
ACCIDENTAL DEATH

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,600
Well, it had to be one of you.

27
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,600
It just didn't
get up and walk away.

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,100
What's missing now ?

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,600
His cinnamon roll.

30
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Don't look at me.
I don'eat breakfast.

31
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,200
You ate my coffee cake.

32
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,800
Two years ago.

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,200
Least someone's eating it.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,700
Gotta be food in there
older than our cold jobs.

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,700
Someone ought
to clean this thing up.

36
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,100
There's a sponge
right over there.

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,300
I ain't the one leaving
things here to rot.

38
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,100
What ?

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Lana was just telling
me about her sister.

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,800
Miriam Forrester.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,400
- Killed August '64.
- Car hit her on the street

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,500
by her house,
threw her into a ditch.

43
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,300
It was two days
before anyone found her.

44
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,900
I was a teenager
at the time.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,700
Thought my sister was just
a repressed '60s housewife...

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,400
- But ?
- Her husband, Harold,

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
just passed away,
and his family found

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,700
some of her stuff in his garage.

49
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,900
Knickknacks, junk mail...
and this.

50
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,500
- Tupperware box ?
- That was her big thing.

51
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,800
Drove old Harry crazy.

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,700
Real man-of-the-times, didn't
want the little wife working.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,600
The thing is,
it's not Tupperware.

54
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,800
That her luggage ?

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,900
I think someone
was returning it to her.

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
But I found this inside.

57
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,600
"I will hunt you down
where you live."

58
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,900
Box was sent from...

59
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,700
Hazelton, Mississippi.

60
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,900
Two days before my sister's
body was found.

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,700
August '64
was Freedom Summer.

62
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,400
And Hazelton, Mississippi
was where all hell was breaking loose.

63
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Black and white warfare.

64
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,200
Ain't exactly the place

65
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:13,801
a suburban housewife
goes for vacation.

66
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,200
Was your sister
involved in some activism ?

67
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,400
As far as I knew, she never left
the Philly city limits.

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,700
Didn't even know
how to drive.

69
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,900
What about her friends ?

70
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,000
Only one friend
I remember, Violet.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,900
But they just
sold Tupperware together.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,200
Got a last name ?

73
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,900
Violet Gold ? Golding ?

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,800
I guess I always had a certain view
of who my sister was.

75
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,900
Now I'm not so sure.

76
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,200
- Mississippi, huh ?
- Please.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,500
Tell me you'll look into this.

78

80
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,300
Wednesday's women

81
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,300
Miriam Forrester,

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
struck from behind
by an unidentified vehicle on Lincoln Drive.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,700
Found August 8, 1964.

84
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,700
Hmm... she was only
22 years old.

85
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,200
Multiple fractures,
abrasions...

86
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,800
It's all consistent
with an auto-ped.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,900
Oh, look at this.

88
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,900
Puncture wound,
base of the skull.

89
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,100
I've seen severed limbs crushed ribs--
nothin' like that.

90
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,400
Body's found in an overgrown
ditch by the road.

91
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,200
Minus one glove.

92
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,100
Burrs in her hair, clothes.

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,300
Might have a better idea
what caused that wound

94
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,800
if decomp hadn't already set in.

95
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,200
Detectives confirmed the husband
was in Boston for business

96
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
when it happened.

97
00:04:58,201 --> 00:05:00,101
Failed to mention his wife's trip
to Mississippi.

98
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,400
Maybe he didn't know.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,300
Well, that all we got ?

100
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,800
A trip to Mississippi
during Freedom Summer ?

101
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,100
Her overnight bag was shipped
in a Tupperware box.

102
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,300
Maybe that's what
brought her down there.

103
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,400
Yeah, kid sister says
that was her thing.

104
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,600
So what the heck do Tupperware
and civil rights have in common ?

105
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,700
Vera's hunting down
Tupperware ladies from '64.

106
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,700
Tell him to be careful.

107
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,300
Those ladies can
sell snow to Eskimos.

108
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,400
He's putting together
a list of top sellers

109
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,500
from Mount Airy who
might've known Miriam.

110
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Violet Golding's name came up,
a couple others.

111
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,600
Take Jeffries;
have a talk with this Violet.

112
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,700
What about the threat letter?

113
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,700
QD's checking it out

114
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,200
and Latents is taking a look
at her overnight bag.

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,400
Oh, and, uh...

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,200
you're missing an earring.

117
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Oh, must've fallen off
on my way to work.

118
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,900
Hey, gorgeous.

119
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,800
- You look good.
- Thanks.

120
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,800
Uh, you, too.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,100
So I've been thinking...

122
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
you know what you and me
need to do

123
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,100
- What ?
- Go on a date.

124
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,600
I mean, a real date.

125
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,400
- Okay.
- You like bowling ?

126
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,900
Sure.

127
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,500
Bowling's good.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,900
Saturday night ?

129
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,400
Maybe do a little
Italian place after ?

130
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,300
It'll be good.
It'll be good.

131
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,600
Everything okay ?

132
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
Yeah, yeah, I...

133
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,000
I just lost an earring.

134
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Oh.

135
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,800
Where ?

136
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,900
You know where.

137
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,600
Uh,  check for me, will ya ?

138
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,700
Check your pocket.

139
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Saturday night.

140
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,300
Violet Golding ?

141
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,400
OPEN HOUSE TODAY

142
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Detectives Jeffries, Rush.

143
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,200
You were one of Tupperware's
top sellers back in '64 ?

144
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:56,701
Yes.

145
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,500
But I don't
sell it anymore.

146
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,900
Wondering if you remember
Miriam Forrester ?

147
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,800
I understand the two
of you were friends.

148
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,700
Wow. Haven't heard that name
in a long time.

149
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,700
Your Tupperware parties

150
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,600
ever take you to Mississippi ?

151
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,500
Lord, no.

152
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,400
You have any idea

153
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,700
what that kind of humidity
does to your hair ?

154
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,600
Place was the epicenter
of civil rights action.

155
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
Know if Miriam got involved ?

156
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,800
What makes you think Miriam
was ever in Mississippi ?

157
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,400
Well, this was found
in her overnight bag.

158
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,000
It was sent from
Hazelton, Mississippi.

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,600
This mean something to you ?

160
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
The Tupperware gals
were all about

161
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,800
getting a new sofa
or some fancy kitchen appliance.

162
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,600
But Miriam ?

163
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Her thoughts ran deeper
than that.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,800
<i>"Walk On By"
by Dionne Warwick.</i>

165
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,500
Lana make it home
all right ?

166
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,500
Cute as a button,
that little thing.

167
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,800
Miriam ?

168
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,000
I know it's not polite
conversation,

169
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
but have you seen
what's going on down there ?

170
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,100
It's awful.

171
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Are you all right, Miriam ?

172
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,700
Harold's never home.

173
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,900
Even when he is,
we barely talk.

174
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm grateful to you for showing
me Tupperware; I really am.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,600
It's just sometimes...

176
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,800
- What, dear ?
- Do you ever wonder

177
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,300
if this is all there is ?

178
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,200
She was what you would call
a "sensitive soul."

179
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,200
Miriam didn't know how to drive.

180
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,600
If she went to Mississippi,

181
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,400
she would have needed someone
to take her.

182
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,100
Well, if she did,

183
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,600
it wasn't with me.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,500
My open house
starts in five minutes.

186
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Hey, look who's back.

187
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,900
Hmm, fit some shopping
into your busy day.

188
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,400
Taking the Tupperware

189
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,800
- research pretty serious, Nick.
- You wanted names.

190
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,700
I got you names.

191
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,300
Didn't come cheap,
did it?

192
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,400
Another Tupperware lady
waiting for you.

193
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,200
Name's Debra Nelson.

194
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,400
No way.

195
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,000
You take her.

196
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,700
I'm done with these sharks.

197
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,700
Been talking to some people
in Tupperware, Debra.

198
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,200
You made the list
of high sellers in '64.

199
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,400
Tupperware was
very popular back then.

200
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,300
It still is today.

201
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,000
Right. See, then
we looked you up.

202
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,300
Got a string of arrests
in the '60s and '70s.

203
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,700
Disorderly conduct,
civil disobedience...

204
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,500
I'm proud of that record,

205
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,400
protesting for our civil rights.

206
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,800
And for that, I thank you.

207
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,600
But in between protesting,

208
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,600
you're selling
Tupperware.

209
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,500
What am I missing here ?

210
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,500
Tupperware was just a cover.

211
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,600
Cover for what, exactly?

212
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,700
Wednesday's Women.

213
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,200
Housewives who
went to Mississippi.

214
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,000
Traveled on Tuesday,

215
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,500
arrived on Wednesday,

216
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,900
back by the weekend.

217
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,200
Black and white women ?
Together ?

218
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,700
We brought supplies
to the Freedom Schools.

219
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,500
Tried to help educate
black children

220
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,100
who were being ignored
by the powers-that-be.

221
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,700
You know anyone in Mississippi
who might've given

222
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,300
this threat letter
to Miriam ?

223
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,000
I stayed in Philly.

224
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,600
Made arrangements
for the girls who were traveling.

225
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,500
Must've been dangerous work
for them.

226
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,500
It was my job to make them
aware of just how dangerous.

227
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,600
When in public, you have
to wear your white gloves.

228
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,900
We've got to
look the part,

229
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,100
like genteel
Southern ladies.

230
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,500
If anyone asks,
and they will,

231
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,800
tell them you're there
to sell Tupperware.

232
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,100
Even your hosts think
that's what you're there for.

233
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,200
Most important,

234
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,600
whites and coloreds
can't be seen together ever.

235
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,400
And not just in Mississippi:

236
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,400
any state below the Mason-Dixon.

237
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,600
That's right, Ella.

238
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,400
And don't discuss the locations

239
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,600
of the Freedom Schools
with anyone,
not even each other.

240
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,700
- Why ?
- Because the KKK is burning them down.

241
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,200
- The schools?
- Three activists

242
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,300
have gone missing
from a town

243
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,700
near where we're going.

244
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,300
College students.

245
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,800
Two white, one black.

246
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,200
Next group leaves
first Tuesday in August.

247
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,100
Whoever wants to be in it,

248
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,800
come get your gloves.

249
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,100
Violet Golding was there ?

250
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,400
She's the one who introduced
Miriam to the group.

251
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,100
You still have that guestbook ?

252
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,500
Sure, I could find it.

253
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,300
So, Violet not only knew

254
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,700
Miriam went to Mississippi,
she went with her.

255
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,400
Violet, Miriam,

256
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,900
Ella, and Belinda.

257
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,000
They all went together.

258
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,900
Violet lied.
Went to Mississippi, too.

259
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,500
On her way in now.

260
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,600
Can't wait to...

261
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,900
hear her excuse.

262
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Mint.

263
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,300
They were out of vanilla bean.

264
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Oh... thanks.

265
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,400
Sorry, man.

266
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,800
You want mine ?

267
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,700
It's a triple mocha thing.

268
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,300
Come with a spoon ?

269
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,100
That's a good one.

270
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,000
The boss, hunting me down.

271
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Catch you later.

272
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,000
Found the other women who traveled
with Miriam and Violet, boss.

273
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,400
Ella Turner died three years ago
of heart disease.

274
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,600
Belinda Hutchins
relocated to Hazelton

275
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,000
a month after
Miriam's death.

276
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,500
Town must have made
quite an impression.

277
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,900
Debra found her files.

278
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,800
Said Miriam's host
was a Kitty Doyle.

279
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,200
Old Hazelton family.

280
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,100
You up for a trip
to Mississippi ?

281
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,200
Haven't been since high school.

282
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,000
I have relatives
in Jackson.

283
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,600
Went every summer
growing up.

284
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,200
Take someone with you.

285
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,800
Lil and Scotty went
on the last trip.

286
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,600
- ...right now.
- No, that's your stuff.

287
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,800
Look at all
the beautiful...

288
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,100
That leaves...

289
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,500
I don't care.

290
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,900
I ain't buying
no damn Tupperware.

291
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,800
Lady's choice.

292
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,500
Is, uh... that
your signature ?

293
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,200
Looks like it.

294
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,700
Got it from a meeting
for Wednesday's Women.

295
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,100
Ever hear of it ?

296
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,600
We're gonna ask you
again, Violet.

297
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,200
You ever been to Mississippi ?

298
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,200
Tried like hell
to forget all of it.

299
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,800
Wednesday's Women...

300
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,000
Hazelton.

301
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,000
Who gave Miriam...
this letter ?

302
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,200
We all had
different hosts,

303
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,600
different assignments.

304
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,200
I never saw that letter.

305
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,900
Tell us what happened
down there.

306
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We were all so hopeful.

307
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,800
We really thought we
could make a difference.

308
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,300
We should have turned around
when we had the chance.

309
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,300
<i>"Come See About Me"
by The Supremes.</i>

310
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Violet, I'm trying
to concentrate.

311
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,300
You're doing swell
for your first time.

312
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,700
You just got to give it
a little more gas.

313
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,800
At this rate,
we won't make it

314
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,900
to Mississippi
till Christmas.

315
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Oh, I think she can do
better than that.

316
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,100
How about you, Ella ?

317
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,200
Didn't even realize
we were moving.

318
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,900
I know how you feel
about this car, Violet.

319
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,400
You talk more about your pride
and joy than you do Alfred.

320
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,500
Well, my husband isn't as pretty
as my Studebaker, now is he ?

321
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,300
- Ooh !
- Oh, come on, Miriam.

322
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,000
This ain't Harold's old Buick.

323
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,600
Floor it.

324
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Car !

325
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
It's okay now.

326
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,200
Wow, look at us. We're flying.

327
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,300
<i>We interrupt this program
for breaking news.</i>

328
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,700
<i>The missing civil rights
workers,</i>

329
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,000
<i>Chaney, Schwerner and Goodman,
were found dead today.</i>

330
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,200
<i>President Lyn...</i>

331
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,500
They killed them.

332
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,500
We can't turn back now.

333
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,800
We gotta keep going.

334
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,700
Miriam...
you don't have to do this.

335
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,200
Yes, I do.

336
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,600
This isn't just
about me anymore.

337
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,200
It's about... Alfred
making you go to his church

338
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,500
instead of where you
were brought up to go.

339
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,600
It's about you and Craig
losing your jobs at the factory,

340
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,500
about your parents thinking
the only reason

341
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,900
why you got a college education

342
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,000
was to marry
a better man.

343
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,300
About all of us.

344
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,500
And our friendship.

345
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,200
And the world telling us
that we can't be friends.

346
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,700
All right, then.

347
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,000
Let's get this car on the road.

348
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
When was the last time
you saw her ?

349
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
The drive back.

350
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
17 hours of silence.

351
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,700
Where'd you drop her off ?

352
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,200
Near her house, Friday night.

353
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,900
- Without her luggage ?
- I didn't notice.

354
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,800
We were all pretty upset
by what we had seen down there.

355
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
We were told
to keep a low profile.

356
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,900
But that wasn't
who Miriam was anymore.

357
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,700
MISSISSIPPI WELCOMES YOU
"ONLY POSITIVE MISSISSIPPI SPOKEN HERE"

358
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
Three hours on a plane,

359
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,300
and another two
in this tin can.

360
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,200
Try 17 hours
in an old beater

361
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,300
with leather seats
and no AC.

362
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,400
That's some cruel
and unusual family vacation.

363
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,500
Yeah.

364
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,800
Dad always made us stop
at this catfish joint, "Aunt Margie's",

365
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,500
Said it was the best
in the state.

366
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,200
Is it far from here ?

367
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,200
Wednesday's Women, you say ?

368
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Be honest,

369
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:37,001
that type of thing could have gotten her
in trouble back then,

370
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,000
if someone had found out.

371
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,100
I always thought
it was strange

372
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,400
her coming all the way to
Mississippto to sell Tupperware.

373
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,800
Why did you let her
stay with you ?

374
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,100
Church said a nice lady
from up North needed a bed.

375
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,200
I thought it was
the Christian thing to do.

376
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,300
You were the one who sent
Miriam's overnight case back to her ?

377
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,200
Yes, I used the same box that I bought
the Tupperware in.

378
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,300
Uh, you were home on leave right then,
weren't you ?

379
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,700
My sister's hospitality extends
to more than just strangers.

380
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,000
Why didn't she
take her bag with her ?

381
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,300
I don't know.

382
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,600
She was here on a
Thursday night,

383
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,000
and then, in the morning
she was gone.

384
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,300
Didn't even say good-bye
or anything.

385
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,100
I... thought it was rude
at the time, but...

386
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,200
Puts things into focus.

387
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,900
Things such as ?

388
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,800
That time we were in town.

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,400
Ms. Miriam saw
that pretty black lady.

390
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,700
You knew something
was amiss.

391
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:34,201
...............

392
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:37,802
<i>Nearer My God To Thee</i>

393
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,600
You need anything
from a store,

394
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,400
Jim can always
bring you into town.

395
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,800
Appreciate
your kindness, Jim.

396
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,900
Yeah, wouldn't
want you thinking

397
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,700
we're all a bunch
of hicks down here.

398
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,800
But I got to admit,

399
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,100
I still think you talk funny.

400
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, yeah ?

401
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,600
Well, you talk funny, too.

402
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,800
What are you gonna do once
Jim's Army leave's over ?

403
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
I mean, I only just learned
how to drive myself.

404
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,900
Don't know.

405
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,700
Now, when exactly
that gonna be, Jim ?

406
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,400
Ha, ha, ain't you funny ?

407
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,500
All he wants to do
is waste time with his friends.

408
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,300
To be young again.

409
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,900
There they are now.

410
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,100
Jonathan, you tell your mama
thanks for that ambrosia now,

411
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,200
you hear ?

412
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,700
Watch what you're
doing there, gal.

413
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,200
You two know each other ?

414
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,600
- No, ma'am.
- What she means is we...

415
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,200
we saw each other yesterday.

416
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,700
She was inquiring if I
was in need of a maid service.

417
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,600
And she told me
she was just visiting,

418
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,300
but maybe the lady
of the house...

419
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
I certainly don't need
a clumsy maid.

420
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,400
Thank you.

421
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,500
This the woman Miriam saw ?

422
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,000
Why, yes.

423
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yes, that's her.

424
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,700
"Clumsy maid" graduated
top of her class

425
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:53,301
from Pe.n.

426
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,500
Explains why she
was so mad at the time.

427
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,500
I guess.

428
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,700
Those were dark days for us all,

429
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:02,501
but things are different now.

430
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,500
There's a new South.

431
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,300
KKK was driving activists
to the county line,

432
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,200
forcing them out
of town back then.

433
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,200
Anyone you can think of
had a problem with Miriam being here ?

434
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,300
No.

435
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,700
She was a charmer.

436
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,800
Certainly made me see Yankees
in a different light.

437
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,100
Know who might
have given her this ?

438
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,500
Goodness, no.

439
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,900
But if she was sneaking around
in that group

440
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,700
like you say, ain't no telling.

441
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Don't throw it like a girl.

442
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,900
Watch it, buddy.

443
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And Rush steps
up to the line.

444
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,400
It's all hanging in the
balance here, folks.

445
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,300
Everything riding on this shot.

446
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,600
Will she or won't she get
to keep the shoes ?

447
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,500
I am kicking your butt !

448
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,500
I'm a bowling shark,

449
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,000
lady, all right.
I'm just priming you up.

450
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,300
Don't be a sore sport.

451
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,800
Ain't over till it's over.

452
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
The boss ?

453
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
Yeah ?

454
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,300
When ?

455
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,800
It's happening.

456
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,100
Kept trying to stall it.

457
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,300
Tell 'em that they should
take somebody else.

458
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,100
But it's you.

459
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,800
Yeah.

460
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Wow. When ?

461
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,800
Ship out later tonight.

462
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,000
So what does this mean ?

463
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,600
You gonna roll into town
under cover of darkness,

464
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,700
and drop me
secret letters

465
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,100
if I promise not
to blow your cover ?

466
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,000
I should have told you
before you took advantage of me.

467
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,900
Uh, don't look so guilty.

468
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,400
It's all right.

469
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,400
It really is.

470
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,200
Ain't guilt I'm feeling.

471
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,200
You're gonna miss me.

472
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,200
Tell you what.
Night's still young.

473
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,100
Want to pick up
a bottle of wine,

474
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,600
hit this place I know ?

475
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,200
Wine's good.

476
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,600
But how about
we skip dinner?

477
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,600
Let's get out of here.

478
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
spend the whole morning

479
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,200
comparing Miriam's puncture wound
with other auto-peds.

480
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,700
Still don't make sense.

481
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,300
Cars were tanks back then.

482
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,900
Could've been something
on the hood ?

483
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,600
Hood ornament ?

484
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,600
Nah, car's too low.

485
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,200
Report's back
from Questioned Documents.

486
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,900
ESDA machine got an impression
off Miriam's letter.

487
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,300
So what'd they give you ?

488
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,200
Name "Cordell."

489
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,300
Anonymous letter isn't
so anonymous after all.

490
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,100
Belinda Hutchins ?

491
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,400
Yes ? I'm Belinda Hutchins.

492
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,000
Detectives Jeffries,
Miller.

493
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,500
Philadelphia Police Department.

494
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,800
This place used to be
a Freedom School ?

495
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
The last one standing.

496
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,900
How can I help you ?

497
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,400
We're investigating
the possible murder of Miriam Forrester.

498
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,200
Understand you took
a trip with her,

499
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,000
down here summer of '64.

500
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
That's right.

501
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,600
You ever see this letter ?

502
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,000
Did someone give this
to Miriam ?

503
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,800
Name Cordell mean
anything to you ?

504
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,800
I knew he was angry, but...

505
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,000
You knew the guy ?

506
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,300
Most of the white residents
saw us as invaders--

507
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,600
threatening their way of life.

508
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,500
But they weren't the only ones
who didn't want us around.

509
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,500
<i>"Will the Circle be Unbroken ?"
by Jimmy Collier.</i>

510
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,800
You pick a poem, Lavan ?

511
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,800
"Mother to Son" ?

512
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,200
"Life for me ain't been

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,900
"no crystal stair.

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,500
"It's had tacks in it,

00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,300
"And boards torn up.

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,100
"And places

I've been a-climbing on."

521
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,700
I like that one.

522
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,800
Penny, it's your turn.

523
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,200
You choose the next poem.

524
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,200
What's the matter ?

525
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,100
One of the girls said
she's writing a poem for me.

526
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,200
Said it'd be done next week.

527
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,600
I didn't have the heart to tell
her I'll be long gone by then.

528
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,100
Come on.

529
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,400
Belinda, you're doing
what you can.

530
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,000
But they still need so much.

531
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,600
We're here together at least.

532
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,000
So, we'll double
our efforts,

533
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,200
and we'll make the most
of the time that we have.

534
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,100
Feel real proud of yourself,
don't you ?

535
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,800
Excuse me ?

536
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,200
I've tried to go along with you
do-gooders comin' down,

537
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,600
but not anymore.

538
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
Not with schools being burned.

539
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,100
- That's not because of us.
- Isn't it ?

540
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,200
White volunteers like you

541
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,400
come pass out pencils

542
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,100
and all the sudden
the Klan somehow knows

543
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,600
- the locations of our schools.
- We're here

544
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,500
because we want to help
the Freedom Schools.

545
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,900
You willing to die for it ?

546
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,400
We'd all be better off

547
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,600
if you'd go back home
and never come back.

548
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,700
Two other schools he started were burned
to the ground by the Klan.

549
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,300
You know where to find him ?

550
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,200
He teaches law
at the university.

551
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,900
Recognize her, Professor?

552
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,400
One of the volunteers who came down
the summer of '64, isn't she ?

553
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,600
Miriam Forrester.

554
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,300
Part of Wednesday's Women.

555
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,900
Weren't exactly a fan
of the group, were you ?

556
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
What's it matter now ?

557
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Miriam was run down
in Philly

558
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
two days after leaving Hazelton.

559
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,700
You think I had something
to do with it ?

560
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,900
She was the reason your Freedom Schools
got bombed, right ?

561
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,800
That's what you said
the day you two had the shout-down.

562
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,900
We know how upset
you were, Professor.

563
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,100
What happened
to your brother.

564
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,400
Kind of anger
you must have been feeling ?

565
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,200
Schools burning down
only made it worse.

566
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,500
No one gave a damn about
the black folk being killed that summer.

567
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,900
Only cared about finding those
two white college boys.

568
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,400
- What were their names ?
- Goodman and Schwerner.

569
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Right.

570
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
Goodman and Schwerner.

571
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,600
Thing was, while the FBI's
trawling the bogs

572
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,100
for those white boys,
they find seven other black men,

573
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,100
murdered and tossed
in the swamps like trash.

574
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,900
They were relieved every time
it was a black man.

575
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,600
Not one of the white boys
being found dead.

576
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,100
Just another critter.

577
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,800
Except one of those
"critters" was your brother Keith.

578
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,500
Got your DMV records.

579
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,800
Inherited your brother's old station wagon
after he died.

580
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,400
What makes you think
I cared enough

581
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,300
to follow that woman up North ?

582
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,400
Your own words.

583
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,500
"I will hunt you down
where you live."

584
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
Your name was
on that letter, Cordell.

585
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,200
That's right.

586
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,200
I gave her this letter.

587
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,500
But I didn't write it.

588
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,400
I know you think

589
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,600
this is just a lark for me.

590
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,000
That I'll compromise
the work being...

591
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,900
Surprised you're still here.

592
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,600
I'm here because
the people up North

593
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
don't understand
what's going on.

594
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,300
'Cause it don't matter to them.

595
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,400
It matters to me.

596
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,600
And to the people
of Philadelphia...

597
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,500
to the whole country.
- Then show 'em this !

598
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
i will hunt you down where you live

599
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,600
Someone gave this to you ?

600
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,000
Get them every day practically.

601
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,000
Paper my walls with 'em.

602
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,300
People need to hear about this.

603
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,600
You think it'll change anything ?

604
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
It changed me.

605
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Come on!

606
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,800
Everybody, come on!

607
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,600
Hurry up.
Come on.

608
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,200
Come on.

609
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,400
It's okay.
I got you.

610
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,100
Building was nothing
but ashes after that.

611
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,300
Any idea who did it ?

612
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,300
Freedom Summer ?

613
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Klan membership in Hazelton went
from a few hundred to 8,000.

614
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,800
Too many to finger.

615
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,600
Probably some with badges.

616
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,000
Anyone see Miriam coming
or going to the school ?

617
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,400
Maybe the same person
who threw that bomb.

618
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,500
I thought she might've

619
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,600
kept her word.

620
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,500
Tried to tell the world
what was really going on here.

621
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,100
The thing is...

622
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,900
she never got the chance.

623
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,400
The things are everywhere.

624
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,500
These burrs made
a real mess of my hair when I was a kid.

625
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,800
Red clay all over my clothes,
mud between my toes.

626
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,200
Sounds like a tomboy heaven.

627
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,100
Think they'll ever find out
who killed Cordell's brother.

628
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,100
I think they'd rather forget
it ever happened.

629
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,200
Along with segregation,
Jim Crow.

630
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,400
Mmm, stuff Veronica
will read about

631
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,000
in her history books.
Yeah.

632
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,500
I just thank God
she's growing up now.

633
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,300
There were burrs

634
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,800
in Miriam's clothes,
right ?

635
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,500
<i>On her clothes and hair.</i>

636
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,000
What if she picked them up here ?

637
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,800
In Hazelton ?

638
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,900
Just like I did.

639
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,600
But why would a lady
like Miriam drive home

640
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,100
17 hours
with burrs in her hair ?

641
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,100
Miriam's injuries
just weren't sitting right.

642
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
I'm looking for anything

643
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,300
so I pull the DMV records

644
00:31:18,301 --> 00:31:20,101
for Violet's '56 Studebaker.

645
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,100
Car she drove to Mississippi ?

646
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,300
Turns out she junks it
at Meyer's Salvage,

647
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,600
September '64,
a few weeks after her trip.

648
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,200
Scrapped her "pride and joy" ?

649
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,700
She's trying
to hide something.

650
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,500
Miller was right.

651
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,900
The burr found on Miriam's body

652
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:35,501
was a Dixie tick trefoil

653
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,800
Only found in Mississippi
and four surrounding states.

654
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,800
So how does a body with evidence
from Mississippi end up in Philly ?

655
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,300
Philly was the dump site.
She was already dead.

656
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,000
Violet got rid
of her car

657
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,100
'cause it was used
to transport a body.

658
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,000
And all this time
they've been covering it up.

659
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,000
Whatever happened
to that Studebaker, Violet ?

660
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,600
I don't recall.

661
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,900
Your "pride and joy."

662
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,600
That's what Miriam called it.

663
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,900
Sure you can't remember ?

664
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,800
It was time for a Cadillac.

665
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,400
Let me refresh your memory.

666
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,100
Your precious Studebaker
was in a scrap heap

667
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,300
two weeks after your trip.

668
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,500
There's red clay
under Miriam's nails,

669
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,600
burrs in her hair

670
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
that only come
from Mississippi.

671
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,400
Now, what happened ?!

672
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,700
We didn't kill her.

673
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,700
But you brought Miriam's body
back to Philly.

674
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,800
We didn't know
what else to do.

675
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,900
We didn't even...

676
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:55,600
know anything was wrong
until we got the call.

677
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,800
What call ?

678
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,200
A man called Violet
at her host's house

679
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,600
and said he knew
who we were

680
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,400
and why we
were there.

681
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,400
Said we'd best come get Miriam.

682
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,800
Get our black asses out
of Hazelton

683
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:15,801
before the same thing
happened to us.

684
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,600
Come to get Miriam where ?

685
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,700
Tell me what happened,
Violet.

686
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,000
You don't have
to keep this anymore.

687
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,900
At the swamp.

688
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,800
Miriam ?

689
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,500
We were babies.

690
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,200
Scared out of our minds.

691
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,400
You didn't go for help ?

692
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,500
I was naive enough
to think we could.

693
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,300
We got to get help.

694
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Call the cops.

695
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,200
For all we know,
it's the cops who did this.

696
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,000
We got to go now !

697
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,600
The tire tracks ran off
into the swamp.

698
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,800
A hood ornament...
from the car that hit Miriam ?

699
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,800
I kept her glove
all this time.

700
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,600
Hasn't been a day
in 40 years that...

701
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,500
I haven't gone through
it all in my mind,

702
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,200
wondered how it could
have been different.

703
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,000
Knew a car couldn't have caused
that wound on Miriam's skull.

704
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,600
Hood ornament
would have been too low.

705
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,200
- But a truck could.
- Only a couple of 'em

706
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,700
- had fancy ornaments.
- That a GMC Deluxe ?

707
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,600
Yeah, and guess
who reported one stolen

708
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,700
in Hazelton, summer of '64.

709
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,500
Why are we here ?

710
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,200
You remember the truck you
reported missing in '64, Jim ?

711
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,300
We're gonna do you
a solid,

712
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,800
help you find it.
We got an idea of where to look.

713
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,500
Hidden at the bottom
of the swamp.

714
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,800
But you've always
known where it was.

715
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,300
- Now, wait a second.
- Haven't you ?

716
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Summer of '64,

717
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,800
every Tom, Dick, and Harry
joined the Ku Klux Klan,

718
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
took up arms.

719
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,500
- You wanted to be one of 'em.
- You're wrong about that.

720
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,800
My family believed in
equal protection for everybody.

721
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,700
- Always had.
- Your family, yes.

722
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,000
But you weren't
like your family.

723
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,400
You weren't home
on leave.

724
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,800
You lied to your sister.

725
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,600
You were thrown
out of the Army

726
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,000
for dishonorable conduct.

727
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,200
Kicked out
of high school.

728
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,700
Couldn't keep a job
at the sawmill.

729
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,000
KKK was the only club
that would have you.

730
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,700
I made good over the years;
I did a lot of good things.

731
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,400
Don't change the past.

732
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,800
Hiding behind white sheets,
burning crosses,

733
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,300
Molotov cocktails.

734
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,800
The New South, right, Jim ?

735
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,900
Miriam disappeared
same night as your pickup.

736
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,900
You find out
what she was really up to,

737
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,200
try to run her
out of town ?

738
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,900
We're gonna pull your truck
out of the swamp, Jim.

739
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,200
Talk now

740
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,600
or the evidence is going
to do the talking for you.

741
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,300
I never meant that lady harm.

742
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,800
What went wrong, Jim ?

743
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,200
I thought she was...
a silly housewife.

744
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,600
Learned the hard way
she was a lot more than that.

745
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,300
Saw you buy those pencils
at the five-and-dime yesterday.

746
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,800
You ain't down here
to sell Tupperware.

747
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,100
Are you, Ms. Miriam ?

748
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,800
I don't see the reason
for us to be out here, Jim.

749
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,500
I heard
some fool firebombed

750
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,900
another one
of them colored schools.

751
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,300
Shame, ain't it ?

752
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,900
Funny thing is
I could have sworn I saw you

753
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,100
on that same road
with a critter.

754
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,700
I want you to take me home now.

755
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,000
Hey, critter-lover.

756
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,000
Where you going ?

757
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,900
Hey, boys,
y'all are just in time.

758
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,500
Ms. Miriam was just
about to tell me about that

759
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,800
- colored school.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

760
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,200
I hear there's only one left.

761
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,400
Now, tell us
where it's at,

762
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,300
real reason
you're in Mississippi,

763
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,400
and we can all
just go home.

764
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,300
Your sister told you
why I'm here.

765
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,100
- It's to sell Tupperware.
- That's bull,

766
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,000
and you know it.

767
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,400
The women o-of Hazelton

768
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,000
haven't had the pleasure
of experiencing

769
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,700
this revolutionary
new product.

770
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
W-When you close the lid,
it makes a little burp.

771
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,500
It's the signature sound:
the sound of freshness.

772
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,400
This is a damn joke.

773
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,700
I-I used to spend hours

774
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
in the kitchen,
but now...

775
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,300
Shut your mouth about
the damn Tupperware!

776
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,600
I saw the way you looked at that
darky in town. You knew her.

777
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,200
You ain't

778
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,400
no Tupperware lady.

779
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,000
I can tell you anything
you want to know

780
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
about the product
becausI use it myself.

781
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,600
Hey, where you going ?

782
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,700
Is you some kind of idiot ?

783
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,000
This lady don't
know squat.

784
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,900
Tell him.

785
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,500
Would you tell him ?

786
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,500
Before they leave !

787
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,700
Where do you think
you're going ?

788
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,100
Don't touch me.

789
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,300
You're pathetic.

790
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,700
I don't understand, Violet.

791
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,200
Your friend was dead.

792
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,300
Why didn't you go to the police,

793
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,300
report what happened ?

794
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,400
We did.

795
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
We didn't stop till
we got to Philly.

796
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,500
We thought
it'd be safe here.

797
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,700
The North, right ?

798
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,800
My name's Violet Golding.

799
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,200
We've been on the
road for hours.

800
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,500
We need to talk
to someone.

801
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,300
- You with them ?
- Excuse me ?

802
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,800
I'm sorry; I-I know how
strange this must seem,

803
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,700
but if you'll
just listen to...

804
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,800
Hang on a sec.

805
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,100
Now, are these women
bothering you ?

806
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,600
You're shaking
like a leaf.

807
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,800
Look, sit down.

808
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,800
You two, come with me.

809
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,600
But we have
to do something.

810
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Oh, I'll take care of it.

811
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,200
- Don't you worry.
- Stop.

812
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Please.

813
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,100
We have to tell you
what happened.

814
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,500
Two coloreds and a Jew walking

815
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
into a police station
at 3:00 A.M. ?

816
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,000
Now, this is going to be good.

817
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,300
Please... Violet.

818
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,700
Come on. Let's just go.

819
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,700
Come on.

820
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,100
Les just get
out of here.

821
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,800
