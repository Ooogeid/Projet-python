00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,850
***

3
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:12,351
<i>"All star" by Smash Mouth.</i>

4
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:34,779
...and especially
our Browning evidence.

5
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,020
They have nothing to answer it.

6
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,100
Jefferson's trying to skate by on nice ideas
without a lot of facts to back them up.

7
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:41,001
Sorry guys, but if you want to take
a trophy, you got to do the work.

8
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,580
Extend across
our unanswered DA harms,

9
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:44,381
and we win this round cold.

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,590
Alyssa, you sure talk fast.

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,970
You know what they say...
speed kills.

12
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,290
Speed and evidence, right ?

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,430
How many pages do you have
in your tubs ?

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,730
Uh, about 20,000. Why ?

15
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,220
Did you research that yourself,

16
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:03,321
or copy it at some overpriced
debate camp ?

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,740
I researched it.

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,730
At Dartmouth's top-rated debate camp.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,940
Great.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,350
You keep saying your Browning
evidence wins the round.

21
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,430
Can you explain it ?

22
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,020
Sure.

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,740
His article says federal funding
for urban schools

24
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:21,841
is politically unfeasible.

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,740
In his first paragraph,

26
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:25,241
which you take totally
out of context.

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,190
Did you actually read the whole article?

28
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,300
And you're the big expert, why ?

29
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,950
'Cause I did.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,130
His conclusion says,

31
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:35,131
"Urban education bills
are risky for Congress,

32
00:01:35,132 --> 00:01:38,132
but the massive benefits
outweigh the political risks. "

33
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,070
Out of a thousand articles
I could have cited,

34
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:45,871
you just happen to have
this one memorized ?

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,610
Can't afford 20,000 photocopies.

36
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,500
Got to use this instead.

37
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,649
Hey Luke.

38
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,000
Now that was a great debate.

39
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,000
You actually memorized the Browning ?

40
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,180
Don't have Dartmouth.
Just my brain.

41
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,070
I saw a bunch of your rounds
last year,

42
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:10,171
and the way you retain info...
how the hell do you do that ?

43
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,670
I always just kind of remembered things.

44
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,700
I mean, you've been mopping up
the Philly circuit.

45
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,401
Did you ever wonder how you'd do
at national tournaments ?

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,690
Harvard ? Berkeley ?
Long bus ride to Berkeley.

47
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,910
Right, yeah, I mean, you can't compete
without resources.

48
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,611
You got to have travel budget,

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,690
- computers,photocopies...
- Beat your team without any of that.

50
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,510
Sure, but imagine what
you could do with it...

51
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,250
national tournaments,college recruiters.

52
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,040
Would you ever consider
debating for Maynard Green ?

53
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,910
What are you talking about ?

54
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,350
I couldn't even afford the jacket.

55
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,960
You wouldn't have to.

56
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:46,361
I'm offering you a full scholarship.
Blazer included.

57
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,310
A debate scholarship. That could be
your best shot at going to college.

58
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,400
What about Ronnie ?

59
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,520
Sorry, but travel budget's
for one.

60
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,920
I made it to College Finals in '87.

61
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,340
There is no thrill like competing
at that level.

62
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,780
If I say yes,

63
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:09,681
I got to wear the stupid jacket ?

64
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,059
Keith ?

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,200
I'm Detective Rush.

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Uh, sorry, I don't...
it's flu season.

67
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,650
You can't be too careful, right ?

68
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,820
What can I do for you ?

69
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,320
I'm not really sure.

70
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,020
See, I'm on the debate team
at Maynard Green.

71
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,130
And they don't teach eye contact ?

72
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,470
Oh. Oh,sorry. Sorry.

73
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,770
Anyway...

74
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:16,871
there was this debater we had.
Ever heard of Luke Cronin ?

75
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,350
Stopped following high
school debate a while back.

76
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,290
I mean,he's kind of a legend.He won every tournament
except his last,and shot himself the night he lost.

77
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,491
and shot himself the night he lost.

78
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Oh, when was this ?

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,620
1999. He was only at
Maynard three months.

80
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,780
Real Sallie Mae kid, apparently.

81
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,950
- Sallie Mae?
- Couldn't afford Maynard.

82
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,400
Only there 'cause of
a debate scholarship.

83
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,970
You want to tell me
why you're here ?

84
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,930
We keep files from way back.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,630
So I've been going through
some of Luke's old tubs,

86
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:50,131
trying to learn from him,
and...

87
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,960
This is the last case
that Luke ever used.

88
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,270
And I found something on the back.

89
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,580
What am I looking at here ?

90
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,990
It's debate shorthand.

91
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,080
Our speeches are timed,
so we talk fast...

92
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,481
400 words a minute...

93
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,080
and shorthand's the only way to keep up.

94
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,640
And what does this shorthand say ?

95
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,630
I'm not sure what the
small symbols mean,

96
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,280
but these...

97
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,670
"I'm going to stop you.

98
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,670
I'm going to kill you. "

99
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,160
A threat letter.

100
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,020
Yeah,dated December 19,1999.

101
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,930
- It's the same night that Luke...
- Supposedly shot himself.

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,480
Don't want to waste your time,
or anything,

103
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,181
but suicide's a big legacy
to leave behind.

104
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,160
If there was something else...

105
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,710
Then we need to set
the record straight.

108
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,250
Forensics

109
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,460
Back in 1999, Luke was under
a lot of pressure...

110
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:11,961
grades, SATs, debate team.

111
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,820
ME said self-inflicted
gunshot to the head.

112
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,560
Trajectory and gunpowder
residue indicated suicide.

113
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,270
No reason to think foul play
till a threat letter shows up.

114
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,700
Local coaches backed
up Keith's translation.

115
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,190
I took a closer look at the wound.

116
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:26,791
There's a star pattern
at the point of entry.

117
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,560
Gun was pressed right against his head.

118
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,700
Nine out of ten suicides, they pull
the gun back at the last second.

119
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,560
Either our debate geek
had some serious stones...

120
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,620
Or someone made good on that threat.

121
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,920
Body was found
in the Maynard parking lot,

122
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:41,621
driver's seat of his father's car,at 6:00 a. m.

123
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,900
Estimated time of death's
around midnight.

124
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:45,901
38 Taurus found in his right hand.

125
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,020
Oh,get one of those
on any street corner.

126
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,920
Well, it's not registered
in Pennsylvania.

127
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:51,721
It's before the Patriot Act,
dead end.

128
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,550
Assigned could only track it so far.

129
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,520
Well, run it with the ATF,
see what comes up.

130
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:56,621
Luke have a record ?

131
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,260
A few problems at Jefferson High.

132
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:00,161
Suspended for stealing books.

133
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,980
But he cleaned up at Maynard.

134
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,240
You don't have to steal
when you have everything.

135
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,010
I used to play baseball against 'em.

136
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,110
Had new equipment every year,
they still sucked.

137
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,810
That coach from '99...
he still around ?

138
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,400
He still has the same job.
We're heading over later.

139
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,200
Luke was at the Pembrook debate
tournament day he died.

140
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:18,101
Threat might have been slipped
to him there.

141
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,010
Any family in the picture ? Might
know if Luke was having problems.

142
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,600
Father's still up in Oak Lane.

143
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:25,701
There's no other relatives.
Nick and Will are talking to him now.

144
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,880
Spent ten years thinking
my son killed himself,

145
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:34,181
and now you're telling me
it was someone else ?

146
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,820
Said you were in the VA
Hospital night he died?

147
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,150
Polytrauma... back injury from the Gulf.

148
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,520
Said you had no idea
where Luke got the pistol?

149
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,250
I learned in the war,no
good comes from a gun.

150
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,010
I taught Luke the same.

151
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,990
Luke having problems with anyone
at Maynard ?

152
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:49,491
Whole 'nother world there.

153
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,590
If he was,
he didn't tell me about it.

154
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,891
I hardly spoke to him those three months
after he switched schools.

155
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,340
He having trouble adjusting ?

156
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:58,941
Workload was tough, even for him.

157
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,490
We pro/con'd it.

158
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:02,491
Thought it'd give him
opportunities I never had.

159
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,380
- Pro/con'd ?
- Pros and cons list.

160
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:05,881
I taught 'em to Luke when he was five.

161
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,930
Smart kid.

162
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,410
Our brains worked the
same way.No off switch.

163
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,970
I thought Luke had found
a good outlet for it.

164
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
Spending time with the debate team ?

165
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,540
Debate was the only
thing that challenged him.

166
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,010
Took him away from
me,even before he died.

167
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,870
Said you'd be gone a couple hours.

168
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:31,671
You missed the all game.

169
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:35,659
I had to read 2000 pieces
of evidence.

170
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,860
***And the train was late.

171
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,450
Since when do you need
all this evidence to win?

172
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm about to debate the
best teams in the country.

173
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,400
Got to keep up, prove I deserve it.

174
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,900
Prove it,hell.

175
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,370
You're smart as any of
those Maynard la-di-da's.

176
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,980
No one wants me on the team,Dad.

177
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,390
Smart or not,I'm still from Oak Lane.

178
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,870
You ain't gonna prove
nothing,working yourself to death.

179
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,160
You even eat ?

180
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,610
Darren brought us...

181
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:09,111
sushi.

182
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,120
Sushi ? Ain't really food.

183
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,330
Want me to fry up some scrapple?

184
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,640
No,I got to start my homework.

185
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,350
Luke ?

186
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,960
Only one who can judge you...

187
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:27,961
is you.

188
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,570
Well,I'm a pretty tough critic.

189
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,810
Guess I'm screwed.

190
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:39,011
<i>"Letting the Cables Sleep"
by Bush.</i>

191
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,990
That's the problem with a genius son.

192
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,960
You never win an argument.

193
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,630
Luke said they didn't want him
on the team.

194
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:49,531
He talking about anyone
in particular ?

195
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,090
Don't know.That was our longest
conversation in three months.

196
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,030
You ever meet this Coach Darren?

197
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,870
No. I tried to stay out
of Luke's way.

198
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,080
Just figured I'd embarrass him.

199
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,880
You think of anything else...

200
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,770
I'm thinking only one thing.

201
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,570
Find the son of a bitch who did this.

202
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,840
Now, says here you have only
four drinks a week ?

203
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:26,841
Is that true ?

204
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,340
Give or take.

205
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,370
Ever have hepatitis ?

206
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,550
The hell you talking about ?

207
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,550
No.

208
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,120
Nick,you have any idea what
liver failure looks like ?

209
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,680
It isn't pretty.

210
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,830
I'll take your word for it.

211
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,210
You need to stop drinking.

212
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:49,911
You need to start eating right, too.
Exercising more.

213
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,220
Been hearing that for years.

214
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,610
Yeah, well, it's catching up to you.

215
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,311
You ever hear of good cholesterol ?

216
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,180
- Yeah.
- You got none of that.

217
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,510
Bad cholesterol,you got lots.

218
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,640
Your long-term outlook is not good.

219
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,560
Well,I can still bench 250
and chase down a bad guy.

220
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,130
- You put that in there?
- Nick,this isn't a joke.

221
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,650
You need to make
lifestyle changes...today.

222
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,700
Are you sending that
to the department ?

223
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,400
Soon as you sign this release.

224
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,910
I don't know.

225
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:32,811
Any debater could have written it.
Standard shorthand.

226
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,550
What about the smaller symbols ?

227
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,820
I've never seen these.
Some debaters develop their own.

228
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,440
They're always searching
for a faster system.

229
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,150
Threat was in Luke's evidence tub.

230
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:43,451
Know who had access?

231
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,530
Anyone who was at the
Pembrook tournament.

232
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,760
Whole squad was there,
lot of other debate teams, too.

233
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,870
Remember what you did
after the tournament ?

234
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,230
Took the team to dinner.Then
everyone went home.

235
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,810
Luke come out with the team
that night ?

236
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,660
No, he left after his last round.

237
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,120
The neighborhood Luke grew up in,

238
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,760
he have a tough time
making friends 'round here?

239
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,040
Yeah, but not for the
reasons you're thinking.

240
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,140
His ability to memorize

241
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:09,441
and apply information,
figures, articles...

242
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,870
I'd never seen anything like it.

243
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,090
Rub his teammates the wrong way,
this "ability" of his ?

244
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,400
He was our top debater in two weeks.

245
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,060
I thought I was giving him
a chance to shine,

246
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:22,561
but maybe I put a target
on his back.

247
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,230
The counterplan just got
cut off at the knees.

248
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:27,231
They're trying to grab onto us
with their generic economy links,

249
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,720
but there's nothing to refute
that we lower state deficits,

250
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:30,021
allowing a payback
on all federal spending.

251
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,070
What they don't realize :
Our plan is bulletproof. It's Teflon.

252
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:34,271
And it improves every school in America.
We have won, let's go home.

253
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,360
Nice speech.
Who's cross-examining ?

254
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,740
Bring that on !

255
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,400
Anyone got a question
for The Oliver ?

256
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:48,801
<i>"Learn to fly" by Foo Fighters.</i>

257
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,870
have a question.

258
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,300
All right, Sallie Mae.

259
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,390
Show me what we get for
$15,000 in scholarship funds.

260
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,570
Why would anybody vote
for your plan ?

261
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,871
When it's already happened ?

262
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,070
What are you talking about ?

263
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,640
Lieberman sent an identical bill
to the Senate yesterday.

264
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:07,741
It's a good idea,
but it's already been done.

265
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,030
I didn't hear about that.

266
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,300
Because you weren't here working.

267
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,820
Luke researched until midnight
last night.

268
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,120
I had an interview with Brown.

269
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:18,121
What wins debates, Oliver ?

270
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,960
Evidence wins debates.

271
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,590
Luke cut a thousand pages
of evidence last week.

272
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,620
Now, I made it to National Finals
in '87 because of hard work...

273
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,290
And you lost it because
your partner slacked off.

274
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,190
That's right.

275
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:33,791
Next week,
Luke's A-Team with you, Alyssa.

276
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,110
If he agrees to wear the blazer.

277
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,640
All right.

278
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,600
It's a good thing Coach
wants you here,

279
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:44,101
because nobody else does.

280
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,690
Hard decision, but

281
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:56,691
Luke and Alyssa became
the best team I ever coached.

282
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,710
Now,who's this kid Luke
knocked off the A-Team?

283
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,520
Oliver Calhoun. Decent debater.

284
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,580
He get his spot back,
once Luke died ?

285
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,540
Rode it straight to the FTA,
for all the good it did him.

286
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:11,340
Kid lost quick. He was never
going to be Luke Cronin.

287
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,880
Last of Luke's tubs.

288
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,590
I carried 'em. So guess what ?

289
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,070
I ain't going through 'em.

290
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,540
Don't hurt yourself.

291
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,580
- Hey, Nick.
- Yeah ?

292
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,410
Still need that medical
paperwork from you.

293
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,350
Doctor was sick,
can you believe it ?

294
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,690
Got another appointment for tomorrow.

295
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,330
- End of the week.
- Yeah.

296
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,210
Someone's afraid of needles.

297
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,040
Whaddya got ?

298
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,820
Partner Alyssa's digging
ditches in Paraguay.

299
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,860
Out of contact,
missed a return flight,

300
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,661
nobody knows when she's back.

301
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,230
What about that Oliver Calhoun ?

302
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,930
Record's shiny... so I
checked Criminal Records.

303
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,250
Turns out he's got a stack of
arrest cards up in Providence.

304
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,700
- All expunged.
- Three DUIs.

305
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,040
Cocaine possession.

306
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,710
Solicitation of a prostitute.Twice.

307
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,440
And that's just freshman year
at Brown.

308
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:06,741
Senior year... he had an unregistered .38
in his frat house.

309
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,600
Same caliber that killed Luke.

310
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:10,301
How'd he get the record expunged ?

311
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,320
Daddy's a partner
at Delfino and Calhoun.

312
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:14,721
Where Oliver's a second year
lawyer today.

313
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,850
Get away with enough, you start
to think there are no rules.

314
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,650
Like to see his Daddy
try to expunge this.

315
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,230
Oliver Calhoun ?

316
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,820
That's what it says on the door.

317
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,840
Need to ask you some questions,wiseass.

318
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,570
Ask away, Detective Grumpy.

319
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:37,671
Let me guess. Detective Bashful ?

320
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,650
Not so bashful when I bash
your head

321
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:40,651
against my car door.

322
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,390
Easy, Chief.
We're on the same team here.

323
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,670
- Law and order.
- Except we

324
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:46,571
put dirtbags away, you get 'em off.

325
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,810
Yourself included.

326
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:50,011
Six arrests disappear
off your record

327
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:52,112
like magic.

328
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,760
How'd you find out about that ?

329
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,230
Mmm, pretty handy with
an unregistered. 38.

330
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,470
How does a sweet kid from
Brown get one of those?

331
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,110
My roommate was Greek.
Got all the good stuff.

332
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,760
We shot through a few
phone books. So,what ?

333
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,430
Same kinda gun shot
through Luke Cronin's head.

334
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,230
Luke Cronin ?

335
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,990
That's why you're here ?

336
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,780
Guy shot himself like ten years ago.

337
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,180
Worked out pretty good for you.

338
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:21,881
Got your spot on the team back.

339
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,910
Hit up the Forensics
Tournament of America.

340
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,290
Fellas... we may have
had problems at first,

341
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,510
but Luke... he turned
into the life of the party.

342
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,040
And I love to party.

343
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,990
I dedicate this trophy to Dartmouth
admissions,

344
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:40,291
and partner Luke...

345
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,450
who's way smarter than that last guy.

346
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,700
You know what ?

347
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,440
You guys aren't half bad
after five of these.

348
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,210
Less talky,more drinky.

349
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:56,111
<i>"Praize you" par Fatboy Slim.</i>

350
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,940
What's wrong ? Too much drinky ?

351
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,340
Only reason we won is beat
'em to death with evidence.

352
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,340
I didn't say one word of my own today.

353
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,660
When you graduate from Harvard,

354
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:16,861
it won't seem like such
a bad thing.

355
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,180
Is that the only reason
you're doing this ?

356
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,480
Someday I'm going to help the world.

357
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,740
Environmental law.
And going Ivy is

358
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:25,141
the best way to get heard.

359
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,780
You got the silver spoon
advantage.

360
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:28,681
You're going Ivy no matter what.

361
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,400
You just think that my life is
so easy, don't you ?

362
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,500
Hey, Sallie. Gotta show you
somethin' funny.

363
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,239
****************

364
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,510
That's... our old tub.

365
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,110
That's Ronnie's tub. You stole it ?

366
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,670
He left it in the tourney lounge.

367
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,650
Must be going crazy looking for it.

368
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,330
Can't wait to see his face.

369
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,100
Hey, this the Maynard party ?

370
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,460
You all seen my tubs ?

371
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,440
Ronnie !Ronnie, you're won't believe
what happened.

372
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,020
Congrats on the win.

373
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,250
Think I'll go back to the Motel Six now.

374
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,110
We all have our own way
to blow off steam,right?

375
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,720
Those were some great parties.
Never forget 'em.

376
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,190
Sounds like Ronnie wasn't
in a forgetting mood,either.

377
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,700
Want to make an omelet,you gotta
crack a few Malcolm-X-quoting eggs.

378
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,810
Kid was one of those
revolutionary types.

379
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,860
Always pissed off at somebody.

380
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,780
What about you ?

381
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,390
After December 1,I couldn't've
cared less about debate.

382
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,700
- What happened December 1 ?
- I got accepted at Brown.

383
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,950
Debate was the means,that was the end.

384
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,760
You didn't care about the FTA ?

385
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,230
Check my judging ballots, fellas.

386
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,040
I was hung over, lost every round.

387
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,480
I mean seriously, do I sound
like a guy who would kill to win ?

388
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,830
August 23,night the Phils won
the game on that triple play,

389
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,350
you see this woman in the parking lot ?

390
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,200
Your manager called it an "incident. "

391
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,270
Think that was her. Yeah.

392
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,790
What kinda incident we talkin' about ?

393
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,250
Saw her on the ground,that's all.

394
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,760
What do you mean,on the ground?

395
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,830
I came out, saw her gettin' up.

396
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,420
Looked 'cross the lot, see
some guy running away from her.

397
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,310
What do you mean,some guy ?
He knocked her down ? What guy ?

398
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,740
- I don't know.
- I said what guy?!

399
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,080
Was he white,black,you
seen him before?What?

400
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,620
I didn't see his face.
His baseball hat was real low.

401
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,190
Show me where they were.Exactly.

402
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,860
I asked if she wanted help,
swear to God.

403
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,990
Said she was fine, drove off.

404
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,030
Drove off in what ?

405
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,980
Blue Cobalt

406
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,981
with a Jesus Fish.

407
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,150
She said she was fine...
she still have her purse ?

408
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,140
I don't know. Guess so.
I don't really remember.

409
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,960
And you didn't think you should
report this to the police ?

410
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,510
Man, told you,
she said she was fine.

411
00:20:19,811 --> 00:20:21,811
****************

412
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,000
So...

413
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,700
am I done here?

414
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,200
Yeah. You're done.

415
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,310
<i>Whoo, check it out ! Coach
is talking to a white lady.</i>

416
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,020
Might be debate team, but
you still gotta keep an eye.

417
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,530
I need to ask a few questions
about Luke Cronin.

418
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,680
Haven't heard that name in a long time.

419
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,220
You two close ?

420
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,310
He was my best friend.

421
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,590
You ever seen these ?

422
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,920
No. Can't read 'em.

423
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,070
Different than standard shorthand.

424
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,380
But you saw Luke at
the Pembrook tournament ?

425
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,640
Night he died. Yeah.

426
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,041
We were both too busy
to say hey.

427
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,980
You ever own a handgun, Ronnie ?

428
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,310
No.

429
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:09,611
But if it might've been murder,
let's start with the black man.

430
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,410
I didn't start here.

431
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:13,911
But now I'm wondering why two best
friends were too busy to say hey.

432
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,530
We were going through a
rough patch the night he, uh...

433
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,870
Was murdered.You always punch
your way through rough patches ?

434
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,580
Look, I regret the hell out of that.
But I didn't hurt Luke.

435
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,050
Must've been jealous... him getting
the scholarship instead of you.

436
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,490
You kiddin' me ? I wouldn't touch
Maynard Green with a hundred-foot pole.

437
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,290
So, why do Maynard security logs
show you trespassing

438
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,891
two days before Luke
was killed there ?

439
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,130
I'm asking you a question.
Answer it.

440
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,280
Or what ?

441
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,280
Kids see you cuffed.
You answer it downtown instead.

442
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,660
Maynard was like quicksand.
I was trying to pull Luke out.

443
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,560
Hey, Luke.

444
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,550
What the hell you doing here, Ronnie ?

445
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,160
You know,I got to drop
the apology bomb,man.

446
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,780
- You're never home,so...
- For what, that schoolgirl punch ?

447
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,170
Yeah.

448
00:22:04,071 --> 00:22:06,271
So... we cool ?

449
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,100
We're cool.

450
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,700
Look, I got to get to class.

451
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,630
Wait a second.

452
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,470
You high ?

453
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,080
What ?

454
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,280
No.

455
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,920
Dextroamphetamine ?

456
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,560
No, you ain't high, Luke.

457
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,430
I only use 'embefore
tournaments to stay awake.

458
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,190
Man, we used to bust on
those Maynard speed freaks.

459
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,810
Give 'em back.

460
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,950
Dr. Melanie Banks.

461
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,260
You got the main line
connection now, huh ?

462
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,180
- Anything to give you an edge, right ?
- I said give 'em back.

463
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,800
I got debate every night,
got to travel every weekend.

464
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:46,101
Got to keep up my GPA
for the scholarship.

465
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,290
You making excuses now ?

466
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,390
'Cause that doctor should be
shot for even giving you those.

467
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,020
Come on,Luke,it's me,man.

468
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,650
It's my problem.

469
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,380
Let me fix it, all right ?

470
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,490
Come on with me, son.

471
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,110
Oh, no, black man on campus.

472
00:23:07,111 --> 00:23:08,411
Got to get the cuffs.

473
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,820
Son,I told you,you cannot come
on campus without an I.D. badge.

474
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,420
I'd never seen Luke like that.

475
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,040
- The drugs weren't a long-term thing ?
- No way.

476
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,970
His dad was on whiskey and
painkillers for his back.

477
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,170
Before Maynard,
Luke wouldn't sip a beer.

478
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,130
Why didn't you come
forward after Luke died ?

479
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,960
To say what ?
Cops said it was suicide.

480
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,300
His dad was already a wreck.
I wasn't much better.

481
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,390
What about that doctor
prescribing the pills ?

482
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,980
I don't know.That was
the last time I saw him.

483
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,310
Maybe he tried to fix
that problem after all.

484
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,710
Anything off Luke's debate notes ?

485
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,130
I've been pounding my
head against the wall.

486
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,020
Still got nothing.

487
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,570
That's a lot of nothing.

488
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,120
Everything Luke wrote
the day he died.

489
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:51,821
I called every coach in town,

490
00:23:52,422 --> 00:23:54,322
still can't translate half of it.

491
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,170
Some of this shorthand,
nobody knows.

492
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,120
What about the symbols
from the threat letter ?

493
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,320
I matched 'em
but I can't translate 'em.

494
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,150
Luke used a couple
of them here and here.

495
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,850
Luke knew that code.

496
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,520
Question is : Who else did ?

497
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,080
Found Melanie Banks.

498
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,240
Psychiatrist practicing
in Colorado,

499
00:24:12,241 --> 00:24:15,541
but in '99 she was married
to Coach Darren.

500
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,140
Was she writing the team prescriptions ?

501
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,080
No,her husband was.
Stole her prescription pad.

502
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,490
Gets better.

503
00:24:21,491 --> 00:24:23,691
She remembers Luke showing up
at their apartment

504
00:24:23,692 --> 00:24:25,792
two days before he died.

505
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,180
Those drugs get out in the open,

506
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:30,181
Darren loses his job and
he's looking at jail time.

507
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,220
Some people will do
anything to keep a secret.

508
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,650
Hey, Coach, these night shifts
are killing me.

509
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:43,751
Got anything to help ?

510
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,130
Think some dextroamphetamines
might do the trick ?

511
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,670
Okay, okay, look,

512
00:24:49,771 --> 00:24:52,471
you should know that my ex-wife
had nothing to do with that.

513
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,280
I took a few slips from her
prescription pad to help Luke out.

514
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,500
By giving him speed ?

515
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,860
They hand Ritalin out like vitamins.

516
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,610
He just needed more hours in his day.

517
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,550
Kid ever come to your house ?

518
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,440
- To my house ? No.
- Wrong answer.

519
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,280
Ex-wife says he was there
Friday before he died.

520
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,060
- He come to confront you ?
- Yes, but not about the pills.

521
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,840
That was just the tip of the iceberg.

522
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,060
What are you doing here ? The
tournament's at 7:30 in the morning.

523
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,050
I got to give these back.

524
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,140
Didn't they help ?

525
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,720
Helped me realize what's
wrong with how we debate.

526
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,340
At Jefferson, I used to enjoy
doing this... discussing ideas.

527
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,870
Now it's just about cranking on these pills
so I can crush everybody with research.

528
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,980
I'm not who I was anymore.

529
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,560
You've won four tournaments
in a row.

530
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:35,661
I mean, that is better than
any Maynard team ever did.

531
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,500
But what's the point if I don't
care about anything that I'm saying ?

532
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,570
There are two education
systems in this country...

533
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,910
one for the haves,
another for the nots.

534
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,730
Wait... you wrote a new case ?

535
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,000
You've been reading Freire.

536
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:55,401
This is pretty complex stuff.

537
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,910
Most of these debate kids

538
00:25:56,911 --> 00:25:58,611
have no idea how the other half lives,

539
00:25:58,612 --> 00:25:59,912
why the poor stay poor,

540
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,050
why my dad couldn't
even think about college.

541
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,380
And we're going to teach them ?

542
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,420
I'm debating the future
leaders of America,right?

543
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,370
If we can change the way
we talk about education...

544
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,730
Yes, but you and Alyssa

545
00:26:08,731 --> 00:26:11,231
are winning big tournaments
with the old case.

546
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,880
We can be national champions
with this one

547
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:15,781
because I believe in it.

548
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,110
You ever read any Foucault ?

549
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,380
There's a piece of evidence here that's
going to make your case even stronger.

550
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,210
I've been pushing
debaters my whole career,

551
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,970
and that was the only
time a debater pushed me.

552
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,320
So how'd Alyssa feel about the new case?

553
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,900
She agreed to it.

554
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,740
They had some kind of
argument at the tournament.

555
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,830
About what ?

556
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,190
I asked her; she didn't
want to talk about it.

557
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,080
Look, the drug thing was
really stupid,

558
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:51,981
but I could lose my job
if people find out.

559
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,600
You should have thought about
that before you gave 'em to Luke.

560
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,310
My dad used to be a cop.

561
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,590
Back then, people respected
their service.

562
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:13,091
They didn't sweat the small stuff.

563
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,560
I wish.

564
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,870
He used to bring home
cartons of cigarettes,

565
00:27:16,871 --> 00:27:18,971
fruit, toys for us.

566
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,110
All of it fell off a truck.

567
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,930
Sounds pretty sweet.

568
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,130
Not like today, huh,

569
00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:28,031
where everybody's up
in your business about everything ?

570
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,080
Fit as a fiddle.

571
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,560
You got your hearing, you got your
vision, and you got your looks.

572
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,010
I can see why you're so
popular around the station.

573
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,680
Just promise me you'll eat an apple
once in a while, all right ?

574
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,630
Scout's honor.

575
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,950
Hey,a package showed up for you.

576
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,770
Something from...Elkayam Jewelers?

577
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,990
Yeah,yeah,I've been waiting on that.

578
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,240
Check this out.

579
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,070
This is Luke's last round. I got
it from the tournament archives.

580
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,890
<i>You know what ? Forget it.
I don't need this evidence.</i>

581
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,380
<i>Look, here's what I'm trying to say.
The neighbohood I come from,</i>

582
00:28:17,481 --> 00:28:20,181
<i>no one gets the opportunities
you all do.</i>

583
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,260
<i>I got out because I'm smart
or whatever,</i>

584
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:24,561
<i>but you shouldn't have
to be a genius</i>

585
00:28:24,562 --> 00:28:26,162
<i>to get a decent education.</i>

586
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,800
<i>People like my father deserve better.</i>

587
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,200
<i>If you're looking for evidence,
put away your pen.</i>

588
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,490
<i>I am my own evidence.</i>

589
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,350
<i>I know this might sound strange,
but...</i>

590
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,810
<i>I'd like to have a
real conversation now.</i>

591
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,810
Look familiar ?

592
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,220
Alyssa wrote that threat right
in the middle of their round.

593
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,360
Her flight made it into
the air a few hours ago.

594
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,310
Got a car waiting at the airport.

595
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,090
Give her a nice,warm Philly welcome.

596
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,780
I told the other police
this is a mistake.

597
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,400
I've been in Paraguay for
two weeks,building wells.

598
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,650
Ever shoot a gun, Alyssa ?

599
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,540
I won't even touch one.

600
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,990
If you spend one day
in a refugee camp...

601
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,730
Saving the world one life at a time ?

602
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,440
Want to explain this ?

603
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,100
I don't remember much about
debate.That was a lifetime ago.

604
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,420
But you wrote it, didn't you ?

605
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,680
Why would I want to kill someone ?

606
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,550
You tell us. You gave it
to Luke the night he died.

607
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,350
Luke Cronin killed himself.

608
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,110
Yeah, after he blew your last round.

609
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,020
Pembrook was a local tournament.We
went three and three with a new case.

610
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,730
It was no big deal.

611
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,250
Thought you didn't remember much.

612
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,830
Headspace you were in back then,

613
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:44,831
losing must have seemed
like the end of the world.

614
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,930
If he had just told me
what he was going to do...

615
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,430
But he didn't.

616
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,180
Luke was so good at moving forward,

617
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:54,981
he never saw who he left behind.

618
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,500
Are you insane ?!

619
00:29:57,501 --> 00:30:00,101
- Do you know who our judge was ?
- No, calm down.

620
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,950
That was Steve Tanner, Mr. Dartmouth
Debate, my only way into that school.

621
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,020
What are you talking about ?
You're graduating from Maynard Green,

622
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:07,321
your parents have a gazillion dollars.

623
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,780
I'm getting "C"s.

624
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,540
You understand ? I bet
everything on debate.

625
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,280
You told me you had "A"s.

626
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,840
Can't keep up with debate and classes.

627
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:16,941
I'm not as smart as you okay ?

628
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,890
It's not a competition.

629
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,350
Now,you go off script and you
pull out your sob story,and yeah,

630
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,900
it's obvious that I can play
backup on The Luke Cronin Show.

631
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,180
So you write me a death threat?

632
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,340
You blew my shot at Dartmouth !

633
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,600
You think going to Ivy

634
00:30:30,601 --> 00:30:32,301
 is the only way
to make people listen ?

635
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,430
They'll listen now if you
got something worth saying.

636
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,690
You hypocrite.

637
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,330
You're going to fix the system
for guys like your dad, right ?

638
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,770
That's why I wrote this case.

639
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,140
You care so much about him,
you never even see him.

640
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,620
- 'Cause I'm trying...
- To win,

641
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,160
like everybody else !

642
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,480
Just using different words, but all
that you care about is that judge.

643
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,940
You're right.

644
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,920
Only one who can judge you...

645
00:31:04,221 --> 00:31:05,221
is you.

646
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:12,100
After Luke's suicide,
everything he said sunk in.

647
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,630
Thought it was my punishment
for treating him like that.

648
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,860
"Only one who can judge you is you. "

649
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,730
After Maynard, I did
some volunteer work

650
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:27,131
and I got my priorities straight.

651
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,320
What do these other symbols mean...

652
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,160
the ones no one can translate ?

653
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,640
We used our own shorthand

654
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:36,541
so that the other teams
couldn't read it.

655
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,040
It says "You don't belong here.
Go back to Oak Lane. "

656
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,220
I still can't believe I wrote that.

657
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:48,080
Don't worry.We have a way
you can make up for it.

658
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,090
ATF report came back on
the. 38 that killed Luke.

659
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,260
Tracked it to a gun show in Delaware.

660
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,410
Purchased by Stan Cronin,
July '97.

661
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,380
I guess Luke's father didn't
hate guns as much as he said.

662
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,730
What was it you told Luke ?

663
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,660
"Only one who can judge you is you" ?

664
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,780
Best advice I ever give him.

665
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,770
You're just full of wisdom, aren't you ?

666
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,610
Back feeling better these days?

667
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,860
Yes... mostly.

668
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,280
It's kind of strange,
a psychiatrist fixing your back.

669
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,870
He moonlighting as a chiropractor?

670
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,260
Don't know what you're talking about.

671
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,640
I called the VA hospital.

672
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,390
The only doctor you've seen in
the past 15 years is a shrink.

673
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,740
PTSD specialist.

674
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,660
How do you judge yourself, Stan ?

675
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,730
'Cause you weren't in any
hospital bed that night.

676
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,400
I'm not going to talk about
this to a pair of cops.

677
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,520
All right.You could talk to a jury.

678
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:05,800
Tell them how you shot
Luke clean through the head.

679
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,680
I would never hurt my son.

680
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,340
It was your gun that killed him.

681
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,940
I was sick.

682
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,540
I wanted to hurt
someone,but it wasn't Luke.

683
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,510
Fourth quarter start yet?

684
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,100
Why isn't the TV on ?

685
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,370
Dad ?

686
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,320
You aren't supposed to be home yet.

687
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
- What's in your hand ?
- Nothing.

688
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,630
I want to watch the game.

689
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,030
Dad.

690
00:33:56,431 --> 00:33:58,431
Give me that. Please.

691
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,420
Trying to do what's best for you,son.

692
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,460
Please, Dad, you're scaring me.

693
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,740
Nothing to be scared of.
You're an amazing kid.

694
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,910
You're going places.

695
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,740
No.

696
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,600
I judged myself today,
like you said.

697
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,060
I didn't like what I saw.

698
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,030
Why are you saying that ?

699
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,210
Big decision I have to make.

700
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,470
I pro/con'd it on the
train ride over here.

701
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,510
See ?

702
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,590
But you got to give me
the gun, Dad.

703
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,790
Now.

704
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:57,200
Put the gun that killed my
son right in his own hand.

705
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,700
I can't be awake

706
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,001
without wishing I could take
that moment back.

707
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,870
What decision was Luke
talking about ?

708
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,710
I don't know. I was too caught up
in my own crap.

709
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,060
Still got the list ?

710
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,170
It's the last thing my son gave me.

711
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,930
Might as well be in Chinese.

712
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,070
What happened after that ?

713
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,400
Drove me to the VA.

714
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,390
I was in a hospital bed that night,

715
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,970
just not in the polytrauma unit.

716
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:44,000
- Mental health ?
- Suicide watch.

717
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,800
I was still there when
I heard about Luke.

718
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:52,050
I couldn't bring myself
to tell you earlier.

719
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,460
I always thought I drove him to it.

720
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,250
Matched up the symbols Alyssa gave
me from their secret shorthand,

721
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,800
and Luke was making a
decision the night he died.

722
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,710
The cons outweigh the pros.

723
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:15,611
Luke was about to quit
Maynard debate.

724
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,770
And Coach Darren was
about to lose his MVP.

725
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,960
****

726
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,230
I've... I've been
waiting for over an hour.

727
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,280
I... I think I've been
pretty cooperative.

728
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:36,730
Sorry, Coach. Just... one
detail still got us confused.

729
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,070
Now, you said Luke was going
to be your ticket

730
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,971
to winning the Forensics
Tournament of America ?

731
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,760
Yeah, that's right.

732
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,950
But it turns out he was pretty
fed up with Maynard debate.

733
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,780
Even listed the cons.

734
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,770
Elitist. Shallow.

735
00:36:50,771 --> 00:36:52,671
Obsessed with winning.

736
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,340
Luke wasn't serious about quitting.

737
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,700
Never said anything
about quitting,Darren.

738
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,800
Only one knew Luke was going
to quit that night was Luke.

739
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,540
Now,isn't that how you lose a debate?You
say one wrong thing,and you blow it?

740
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,430
You lose a debate by not
having the right evidence.

741
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,160
See,the problem with
close-range killings...

742
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,890
you get blood on yourself.

743
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,300
Then,you got to drive home.

744
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,530
See, the reason you've been waiting
so long is,

745
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:24,431
CSU went through every inch
of your Civic.

746
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,390
I don't own a Civic.

747
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,190
You did in '99... it was brand-new.

748
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,560
So,why'd you sell it the week
after Luke died ?

749
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:30,861
I needed a bigger car.

750
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,500
Smart guy like you can't
figure that out before you buy ?

751
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,490
There's a name for this kind of
evidence. It's called circumstantial.

752
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,540
It's better than an eyewitness,

753
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,560
'cause it doesn't lie.

754
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,490
Found Luke's blood in the car.
That circumstantial, too ?

755
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,210
You must get a lot of
idiots in here, all right ?

756
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,070
You can't check DNA in an hour.

757
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,950
Blood type... it's Luke's.

758
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,780
Found it next to the tire hump
where you stashed that bloody coat.

759
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,680
Do you not think
that I can see a bluff ?

760
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,220
I made it to Debate National Finals.

761
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,680
1987.

762
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,010
Yeah, we looked that up.

763
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,320
Well, turns out it was you
who lost it,

764
00:38:05,321 --> 00:38:06,421
not your partner.

765
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,510
Debate is an extremely nuanced activity.

766
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,640
Lost for...

767
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:13,230
"insulting the other team,
a profound sense of arrogance. "

768
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,990
I miss a nuance there somewhere ?

769
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,620
- Yes. It was only one round.
- Not for you.

770
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,800
You disappeared off the face
of the earth after that loss.

771
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,900
Because I had to get
away and just decompress.

772
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:26,770
So, you skipped out on law school, became
a high school debate coach instead.

773
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,470
What do you... what do you call that ?
What's that phrase ?

774
00:38:32,471 --> 00:38:33,771
Uh, those who can't do..

775
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,080
- Teach.
- That's right.They teach.

776
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:44,900
If I hadn't lost in '87,everything
would have been different.

777
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,000
Freezing out.

778
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,150
What's so important
you call me at 11:30 ?

779
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,280
Coach... I'm sorry.

780
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,610
I got to quit debate.

781
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:29,610
Look,I don't care that
you lost.All right?

782
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,030
You're passionate about the
case.We'll just work it hard next week.

783
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,860
It's not the case.It's me.

784
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,540
Okay, Luke, you're not quitting.

785
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,000
I put a lot of trust in you.

786
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,600
I... I stuck my neck out
to get you this scholarship.

787
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,730
My dad...

788
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,020
tried to kill himself tonight.
Okay ?

789
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,030
I pulled a gun from his hands.

790
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,330
You brought a gun onto campus ?

791
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,690
Can't take it home.

792
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,300
I don't know what to do with
it.Been driving in circles.

793
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,030
Luke, I'm sorry.

794
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,060
All right,I'm sorry. If there's
anythingI can do to help...

795
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,810
You can let me off the
hook.My dad needs me.

796
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,230
What do you mean,
let you off the hook ?

797
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,140
If you quit the team,
you lose that scholarship.

798
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,720
So I lose it. I'll go back
to Jefferson and debate.

799
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,270
At what tournaments ?
Allentown ? Scranton ?

800
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,630
I used to have fun doing this.

801
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,970
Then, what are you gonna do ?
End up like your dad ?

802
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,280
Lose your brain to the army and you start
working in some car shop your whole life ?

803
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:26,710
My dad... is twice the man you are.

804
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,120
- He tried to kill himself!
- Get out of the car.

805
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,670
- You can't do this to the team.
- You don't care about the team.

806
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,550
- You just want trophies.
- I'm not letting you go,Luke.

807
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,760
Not after everything I've done.

808
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,410
I'm not asking permission.I quit.

809
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,120
This is the year, Luke !

810
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,540
You blow this chance,

811
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:43,341
and you will regret it
for the rest of your life !

812
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,450
I won't.

813
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,450
Because I'm not you.

814
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,120
Me?I went to National Finals.

815
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,780
- And lost.
- Because of my partner.

816
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,790
Because of you !

817
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,030
Watch your mouth.
That's not what happened.

818
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,600
We all know what
happened. You're a liar.

819
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,760
That is not true !

820
00:40:56,761 --> 00:40:58,461
Hanging onto a victory
that doesn't exist.

821
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,870
- Shut up ! Shut up !
- Because you never won.

822
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:03,090
Shut up ! Shut up !

823
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:36,091
