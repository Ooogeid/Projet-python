1
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:03,176
The ginger lipstick.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,710
I don't know, Tenley.

3
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:06,612
No frumpy on your wedding day.

4
00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:09,549
And those extensions ?
They're awful. Something borrowed.

5
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:10,452
Dan,

6
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:12,453
help me.

7
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:16,422
- With what ?
- You want a hot bride, right ?

8
00:00:16,456 --> 00:00:18,692
Long hair, some makeup for once ?

9
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:21,094
Well, I...

10
00:00:21,328 --> 00:00:23,262
I think Anna is beautiful.

11
00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:25,298
Well...

12
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:27,567
There's a lonely groomsman
in the bar

13
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:29,001
who needs my company.

14
00:00:29,436 --> 00:00:31,370
See you at the altar.

15
00:00:33,707 --> 00:00:35,608
Don't lose those rings, cowboy.

16
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:37,243
No, ma'am.

17
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:39,145
My friends are very charmed
by you, Dan.

18
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,647
Oh, I'm-I'm glad.

19
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,382
And I've been guaranteed page one

20
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,050
of the society section tomorrow.

21
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,585
He doesn't care, mom.

22
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:46,886
This is the event of the summer.

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,922
I have over a year in it.
I care.

24
00:00:49,056 --> 00:00:50,690
It's been storybook.

25
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:52,726
Now, maybe they'll let us
into the Milton Club.

26
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,828
Joan, let's leave 'em alone.

27
00:00:55,462 --> 00:00:56,395
Hey, thanks.

28
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,097
Ed, you've been very generous.

29
00:00:58,131 --> 00:01:00,099
Well, she's my girl.

30
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:02,301
You'll get the bouquet
in the morning ?

31
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:04,036
Bouquet, boutonnieres, veil.

32
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,172
You two just get to the church
on time.

33
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:14,681
Yes, my mother is a social climber.

34
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:16,382
And my sister's a slut. Yeah.

35
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,617
But they're
part of the package, babe.

36
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:21,287
Well, honey, your dad's nice.

37
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:25,792
<i>"Sweet thing" by Keith Urban.</i>

38
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:28,427
For better or worse, right ?

39
00:01:30,397 --> 00:01:31,798
Anna...

40
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:36,536
I can't go through with it.

41
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:31,124
Hey.

42
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:32,692
Looking sharp.

43
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:34,660
Man, I hate weddings.

44
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:37,530
Six hours talking to
people you don't know.

45
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:39,065
What's to hate ?

46
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:41,367
Plus, Nova plays Uconn tonight.

47
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:44,136
I'm guessing Louie ain't into hoops.

48
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:46,939
How'd John get out of this ?

49
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:48,874
He's at home, watching the pregame.

50
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:50,910
Not too swift, huh ?

51
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:52,912
Invites us, but not the boss.

52
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:54,413
Why are we here ?

53
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:56,383
I mean, I see Louie
at crime scenes,

54
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:57,984
what, twice a year ?

55
00:02:58,018 --> 00:03:00,152
I got roped into
his bachelor party.

56
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:01,354
At his chess club.

57
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:03,356
Shoot me now.

58
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,293
End of the night, though,

59
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:07,094
after all the booze...

60
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:08,728
I heard something interesting.

61
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:10,196
Yeah ?

62
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:12,598
That girl Louie's marrying...

63
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:14,700
almost got hitched two years ago.

64
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:15,835
Almost ?

65
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:18,237
Groom called it off, night before.

66
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,506
Few hours later,

67
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,441
he's tossed off a balcony,

68
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:23,976
ten floors.

69
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:25,611
Cherry Hill regency.

70
00:03:25,646 --> 00:03:27,580
- Jersey cops clear it ?
- Nope.

71
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,483
Bride was top of the list,
but

72
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:30,984
they couldn't make the case.

73
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:33,486
And now she's marrying Louie ?

74
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:36,288
Hey, guys !

75
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:38,891
How you doin' ?

76
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:40,593
Hey, Louie.

77
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:42,094
Looking good.

78
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,763
Yeah, you, too. You, too.

79
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:45,131
See you in there, all right ?

80
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:46,432
Yeah.

81
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:52,271
Might not be such a
boring night, after all.

82
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:59,476
Cold Case
Season 7 Episode 15

83
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:23,314
Two weddings

84
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:37,917
This is really how we want
to spend our night off ?

85
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:38,951
Working a case ?

86
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,020
It's that or the chicken dance.

87
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:42,721
We gotta. For Louie.

88
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:45,224
You go by Cherry Hill PD ?

89
00:04:45,258 --> 00:04:47,759
Yeah, buncha gorks.
All glued to some football game.

90
00:04:47,794 --> 00:04:48,861
Basketball.

91
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,997
And they weren't getting off
their duffs for a Philly cop.

92
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:52,365
You get anything ?

93
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,001
Groom was Dan Palmer.

94
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:57,869
Told this girl no-go on
the wedding at midnight.

95
00:04:57,937 --> 00:04:59,005
Rough move.

96
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,606
At 3:15, someone took him

97
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:03,509
to task for it.
Big scuffle on a hotel balcony,

98
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:05,177
broken glass, tossed furniture...

99
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:07,446
Dan hits the pavement.

100
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:09,181
That's a lot of people with motive.

101
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:10,349
Starting with the bride.

102
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:12,384
- She give a statement ?
- Whole family stonewalled.

103
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:14,753
The lawyer swooped in,
no interviews.

104
00:05:14,787 --> 00:05:17,089
Smart. Unfortunately.

105
00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:18,724
Who had access to the room ?

106
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:20,459
It was a suite for the
whole wedding party.

107
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:22,195
So, anyone.

108
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:25,064
Well, security recorded two
key entries to the room,

109
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:27,332
a few minutes apart,
around 3:00 a.M.

110
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:28,968
Dan and the doer.

111
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:31,870
One other mystery : Dan had
the wedding rings that night.

112
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:33,472
But they were gone
after the murder.

113
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:34,940
Consolation prize.

114
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,709
Poor Louie.

115
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:38,577
Caught up with a black widow.

116
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:40,579
I don't know.
My mind goes to the dad.

117
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:42,047
Humiliate my girl,

118
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,816
stiff me for a hundred g's ?

119
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,017
I say mom.

120
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:47,519
Mess with the baby cub,
she eats you up.

121
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:50,957
She does look pretty fierce.

122
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:54,026
I mean, what were you thinking ?!

123
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:57,429
Go make a friend, Scotty.

124
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,841
I got it.

125
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:13,478
You're a bright spot on a dark day.

126
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:15,447
Your daughter's wedding ?

127
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:16,849
It's dark ?

128
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:19,084
This isn't the man she
was supposed to marry.

129
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:20,620
No, huh ?

130
00:06:20,854 --> 00:06:23,656
He's probably a friend of yours.

131
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,226
Louie...

132
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:27,027
is more of an acquaintance.

133
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,327
High school.

134
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:30,830
Looks like you've climbed
a rung or two higher

135
00:06:30,864 --> 00:06:32,697
than he did since then.

136
00:06:33,432 --> 00:06:34,833
I've done okay.

137
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:36,068
Lawyer ?

138
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:38,604
No. Banker.

139
00:06:39,938 --> 00:06:41,640
It's obvious, huh ?

140
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:43,841
Well,

141
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:45,678
Well, Anna went to
Sarah Lawrence.

142
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:47,379
Teaches at Whitman prep.

143
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:48,413
That's classy.

144
00:06:48,448 --> 00:06:50,449
And he's a cop.

145
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:53,585
- It's beneath her.
- She's playing it safe.

146
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,521
After the fiasco last time.

147
00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:56,622
Right.

148
00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:59,190
You know about it, of course.
Everyone does.

149
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:01,593
You like her first choice better ?

150
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:03,829
That wedding was picture perfect.

151
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:06,499
He was perfect.

152
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,500
<i>"Kiss a girl" by Keith Urban.</i>

153
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:15,209
All right, uh...

154
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,910
glasses raised,

155
00:07:16,943 --> 00:07:18,577
ladies and gents.

156
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:20,980
To Anna's mom,

157
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:23,482
Joan, who chose the menu,

158
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:26,251
the flatware, my suit.

159
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:28,887
Get used to it, darling.

160
00:07:28,922 --> 00:07:30,124
And Ed,

161
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,325
who let her blow all of his dough.

162
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:35,795
But mostly to Anna...

163
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:39,265
who found a stray on
the side of the road

164
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:40,299
and took him in.

165
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,634
I was...

166
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:42,735
aimless,

167
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,737
never settling down...

168
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:46,605
a lone cowboy.

169
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,042
Of course, the...

170
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:52,046
the beginning of something

171
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:54,447
is the end of something else.

172
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:57,716
But I have wandered enough.

173
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,685
And all of those winding roads--

174
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:01,220
they led to you.

175
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,255
I'm getting carsick.

176
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:07,893
I love you.

177
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:18,336
There are photographers here.

178
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:20,305
We getting this load on film ?

179
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,407
Ed, he's a prince.

180
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:24,376
I don't trust him.

181
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:29,848
I said give me one good reason.

182
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:30,983
And ?

183
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:32,384
"Too handsome."

184
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,086
Ridiculous, right ?

185
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:38,190
Sounds like Dan was
the one that got away.

186
00:08:38,224 --> 00:08:38,958
He was Romeo.

187
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:40,860
Tragic end and all.

188
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:43,996
Couldn't have been too
perfect though, right ?

189
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,998
Getting cold feet ?

190
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:48,400
I think my husband was behind that.

191
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:49,701
No kidding.

192
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:52,170
He didn't want the wedding
to happen, and it didn't.

193
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:53,605
Mrs. Coulson ?

194
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:56,875
Showtime.

195
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,677
I'm walking Anna down the aisle.

196
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:01,046
- Where's your husband ?
- Ex.

197
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,548
Probably at the Pearl, boozing.

198
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,551
He's not in touch anymore.

199
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:16,762
Where's Vera ?

200
00:09:16,796 --> 00:09:18,063
Shoe issue.

201
00:09:18,797 --> 00:09:20,098
It's a quote.

202
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:26,138
What'd you find out ?

203
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:28,273
You're not so dumb.

204
00:09:28,307 --> 00:09:29,808
My dad theory ?

205
00:09:29,842 --> 00:09:31,577
Yeah, he had it out for the groom.

206
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:34,113
And guess what ?
He's not even here today.

207
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:36,916
That's a conversation.

208
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,984
Someone should track him down.

209
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:41,120
Boss is available.

210
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:43,889
Guy's watering hole is the Pearl.

211
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,529
Your guy sold me $200 shoes.

212
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:52,198
I got blisters already.

213
00:09:52,232 --> 00:09:54,466
And you're still wearing a rental.

214
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:56,802
I like the paisley.

215
00:09:56,836 --> 00:09:58,003
Thanks.

216
00:09:58,038 --> 00:09:59,572
It's slimming.

217
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:11,350
Poor rube.

218
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:14,420
This is the first day
of the end of your life.

219
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:42,114
<i>And you may have heard
during our pregame introduction,</i>

220
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:46,352
<i>that the Fredrickson clan
is well represented here...</i>

221
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:51,123
Double scotch.

222
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:52,759
Make it two.

223
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,960
<i>It's coming up.</i>

224
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:55,894
Why not ?

225
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:57,463
The night is young.

226
00:10:57,497 --> 00:10:59,298
I got a lot to forget.

227
00:11:00,132 --> 00:11:01,633
What are you drinking about ?

228
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:03,769
Oh, family, daughter.

229
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:06,839
Yeah. Huh.

230
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:09,808
She's running with a bad guy,

231
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:11,977
and I feel I have got
to do something.

232
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:14,313
Mine's getting married today.

233
00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:16,215
And you're here instead.

234
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:18,650
My ex-wife banned me.

235
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:20,619
So, fine.

236
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:22,721
Who needs it ?

237
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:24,056
The guy a problem ?

238
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,725
No. I like this one, actually.

239
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:28,193
There was another one ?

240
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:30,496
Yeah. Long story.

241
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,832
Short version is he ran out
on the wedding.

242
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:34,967
Night before.

243
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,135
That's nuclear.

244
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,704
Yup.

245
00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:41,506
You get killed on the tab ?

246
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,342
That was the easy part.

247
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:46,812
Thing blew up our family.

248
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:49,214
My daughter was crushed,

249
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:52,351
wife turned shrew.

250
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:56,021
You may be a better man than me,
but I'd hunt him down.

251
00:11:58,324 --> 00:11:59,858
Truth ?

252
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:01,693
I was relieved the guy walked.

253
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:03,562
And why's that ?

254
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:05,998
I have another daughter.

255
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:09,634
Troublemaker.

256
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:15,174
I mean, that night,

257
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,644
I was in an impossible situation.

258
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:24,516
So that poetic puppy dog toast ?

259
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,751
Anna brought me home
and tamed me ?

260
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,386
Yeah. Bunch of twaddle.

261
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:32,090
Sorry you think so.

262
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:34,226
Dan, I'm 30 years old.

263
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,495
I've been with many grooms.

264
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:37,996
And ?

265
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,431
Your heart's not in it.

266
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:41,566
You don't want to get married.

267
00:12:42,968 --> 00:12:44,236
No, I do.

268
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,405
It's a new chapter.

269
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,507
That's snoozy.

270
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,378
- Yeah. You don't know me.
- I know your type.

271
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:54,481
You like freedom,

272
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:55,882
options.

273
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:58,616
Scrabble at home
with a brainy wife ?

274
00:12:58,651 --> 00:12:59,818
No, thanks.

275
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:01,553
I've changed.

276
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:03,255
Again, twaddle.

277
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:07,893
You cannot have
everything you want.

278
00:13:08,027 --> 00:13:09,794
You're dealt a hand,

279
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,431
- and you make it work.
- Dreamy.

280
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:15,300
I hope my husband talks
about me that way.

281
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:18,971
Anyway, I should get back...

282
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:21,307
You are who you are, Dan.

283
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:23,642
Why don't you just face it ?

284
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:25,377
Come upstairs.

285
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:31,283
<i>"Crazy girl" by Kelly Pardekooper.</i>

286
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:41,559
One daughter going
after another's groom ?

287
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:43,028
With abandon.

288
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,397
That ends badly.

289
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:48,834
Worse than you know.

290
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,043
The maid of honor
hits on the groom.

291
00:13:58,077 --> 00:13:59,511
And dad saw it all.

292
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:02,047
So if I'm Anna,
get wind of that...

293
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:04,983
Then Romeo pulls the rug out.

294
00:14:05,017 --> 00:14:06,752
And I got double
motive to smoke him.

295
00:14:06,786 --> 00:14:09,955
But twisted sister's the one
up in the room with him.

296
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,359
We shouldn't do this.

297
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:16,161
We should just be
like normal people,

298
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:17,596
Enjoy the night.

299
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:19,197
Leave it alone.

300
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:20,632
Or we could fan out

301
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,334
and talk to both the gals.

302
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:25,570
- There's the receiving line.
- I'll find the tramp.

303
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:27,372
- So, what am I doing ?
- It's a wedding.

304
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:29,674
- Go meet someone.
- I know enough people.

305
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,476
Get some free booze.
What's your beef ?

306
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,578
Maybe the guys in the
kitchen have the game on.

307
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:41,053
- Valens.
- Louie.

308
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:42,221
Rush.

309
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:45,356
Hope you're okay with this.

310
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:47,025
Oh, I'm coping, Louie.

311
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,928
This is my bride, Anna.

312
00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:52,163
Been dying to meet you.

313
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:53,865
Are you colleagues ?

314
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:56,066
Best cops I know, these two.

315
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:57,635
And Louie's our favorite tech.

316
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,104
I'm very lucky I found him.

317
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:00,705
We met a year ago today.

318
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,241
Whirlwind romance.

319
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:04,776
I'd love to hear all about it.

320
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,844
Anna, the line needs to move along.

321
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,080
Maybe we can talk later.

322
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:14,552
Hey, is the boss coming ?
He never rsvp'd, but

323
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:15,854
we saved a spot for him.

324
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,756
- Yeah, he'll be here. Okay.
- Yeah.

325
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,991
Yeah.

326
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:24,829
- Officer.
- It's detective, actually.

327
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:26,531
Homicide.

328
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:47,686
Ah, shrimp. Primo.

329
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,788
Lethal drinks, too.

330
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:53,024
So, you gonna take a run
at one of those guys ?

331
00:15:53,058 --> 00:15:54,125
Considering it.

332
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,794
Well, you have to.
It's a wedding.

333
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:59,063
We think alike.

334
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:01,666
And who are you here with ?

335
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,734
Solo.

336
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:05,202
So you're scoping, too.

337
00:16:05,237 --> 00:16:07,038
Well, trying to keep a lid on it.

338
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:08,607
Well, the last wedding I was at,

339
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:11,242
I ended up dirty dancing
with the lady chaplain.

340
00:16:11,977 --> 00:16:13,445
I got that beat.

341
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:15,046
Oh, do tell.

342
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:17,315
It was Anna's first wedding,

343
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:19,517
Which we're not
supposed to talk about.

344
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:21,653
Well, we can always
whisper.

345
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:25,857
I took the groom for a test drive.

346
00:16:27,491 --> 00:16:29,027
The guy who ditched her ?

347
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:30,962
That was over you ?

348
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:34,032
I can't help it if
I'm Helen of Troy.

349
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:41,640
Here's to little sisters trying
to beat you to the punch.

350
00:16:44,276 --> 00:16:45,710
She's a good person.

351
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:47,612
Better than you or me.

352
00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:56,154
God, I'm messing this up.

353
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:58,222
What is my problem ?

354
00:16:58,357 --> 00:16:59,924
You're a jerk. Live with it.

355
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,193
I'm not. I just...

356
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:02,795
Just what ?

357
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:08,466
- I can't talk about it.
- Then shut up.

358
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:14,467
<i>"Before he cheats"
by Carrie Underwood.</i>

359
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:24,983
- Oh, man.
- Ignore it.

360
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:26,517
Danny, it's Phil.

361
00:17:27,252 --> 00:17:28,886
Oh, it's my best man.

362
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:36,728
Hey.

363
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:38,597
You made it, man.

364
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:42,032
Yeah. Train was late.

365
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:43,901
What is this ?

366
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:45,436
You drinking ?

367
00:17:45,571 --> 00:17:46,538
Uh, just one or...

368
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:48,640
Six.

369
00:17:48,674 --> 00:17:51,476
Dan, you're not
going off the rails.

370
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,845
It's not gonna work, Phil.

371
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:56,548
Get downstairs and
be with your bride.

372
00:17:56,982 --> 00:17:58,216
I don't know. Hey.

373
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:00,952
This is a good thing
for both of us.

374
00:18:00,986 --> 00:18:03,121
I don't think I can do it.

375
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:06,658
Look, forget Baltimore.

376
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:07,759
Okay ?

377
00:18:08,193 --> 00:18:11,029
Just walk this off,
get back down to that dinner.

378
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:12,998
This didn't happen.

379
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:15,633
Hey, did you meet her ?

380
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:18,403
Anna ?

381
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:22,974
Um... Not what I expected.

382
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:34,019
Maid of dishonor. Oh, well.

383
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:36,221
No scruples, huh ?

384
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:38,956
Your own blood. Cheers.

385
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:43,294
She's the little sister.

386
00:18:43,328 --> 00:18:45,230
Getting married before me ?
Inappropriate.

387
00:18:45,264 --> 00:18:46,464
Gotcha.

388
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,600
So what the heck was in Baltimore ?

389
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:51,669
I don't know. It's their hometown.

390
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:55,039
So, how was Dan getting
married good for both of them ?

391
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:58,209
They were always talking about
some fancy gym they wanted to buy.

392
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:01,879
And Dan was about to marry rich.

393
00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:03,681
Yup. We're loaded.

394
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:04,849
More booze ?

395
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:06,185
Giddyup.

396
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,872
<i>Phil and Dan had a company named</i>

397
00:19:09,873 --> 00:19:11,373
Hampden, inc.

398
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,024
Baltimore ?

399
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:16,154
Bunch of business ventures.
All failed.

400
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:18,262
<i>They filed for bankruptcy twice.</i>

401
00:19:18,387 --> 00:19:19,897
So, empty pockets.

402
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,714
- I got to go. He's here.
- Hey, boss, tough news.

403
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,635
What ?

404
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,383
<i>You got to suit up and
get to this thing.</i>

405
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:30,293
What ?!

406
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,810
Check your inbox once in a while.

407
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:40,747
Oh, crap.

408
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:46,638
So, somebody's charging flights
to India on my business card ?

409
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:48,393
Yeah, we're circling the guy.

410
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:51,953
Just sign this and verify
you weren't heading to bombay.

411
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:54,397
Okay, no problem.

412
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,870
This ever happen
with Hampden, inc.?

413
00:19:57,977 --> 00:19:58,707
Uh, no.

414
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:00,406
No. That company never
got its wheels up.

415
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,941
'Cause you lost your partner.

416
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:03,605
Dan. Yeah.

417
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,820
How'd you feel about
him jilting that girl ?

418
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,627
So, this isn't about credit cards.

419
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,455
March, 2008.

420
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:17,646
You and Dan put a bid

421
00:20:17,771 --> 00:20:20,093
-  on Woodland Health and Spa.
- True.

422
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,720
You guys didn't have that
kind of dough, but Anna did.

423
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,390
Look, I wanted him to get married.

424
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:26,298
Oh, sure.

425
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,851
- No wedding, no gym.
- No.

426
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,769
No, not for the money.
I liked Anna.

427
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:31,929
- I liked her for him.
- And why's that ?

428
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,131
Because he was wasting his life.

429
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:37,572
You know, too much
drinking and cheap women.

430
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:39,070
- Then Anna came along.
- Yeah.

431
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,344
She's a straight arrow.

432
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:41,858
He started living right.

433
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:45,209
But the night before Dan's wedding,
he's holed up with Tenley.

434
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:48,246
Yeah. Talk about cheap.

435
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,822
Did Anna hear about that ?

436
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:51,890
Dan and her sister in that suite ?

437
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:53,970
I don't know.

438
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,915
I hope not.

439
00:21:06,523 --> 00:21:07,572
What table ?

440
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,559
Uh... 14.

441
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:10,746
Eh... 11.

442
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,544
Not for long.

443
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,014
So, where's Kat ?

444
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:17,621
She...

445
00:21:17,822 --> 00:21:19,322
said she wasn't coming

446
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:20,623
if I was.

447
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:22,488
I won't ask.

448
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,009
Good move.

449
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,826
So, what are you up to ?

450
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,989
Trying to get the bride alone.

451
00:21:28,127 --> 00:21:29,127
Why ?

452
00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:31,522
I've got some questions for her.

453
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,090
You're working at the wedding.

454
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:34,333
Well...

455
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:35,734
Yeah. I mean,

456
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,370
you know, kind of.

457
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,216
- Hopeless.
- Well, she might have killed her first fiance.

458
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,141
Am I supposed to just
overlook that ?

459
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:45,923
Well, maybe, for three hours.

460
00:21:46,212 --> 00:21:47,679
Take it up in the morning.

461
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:50,366
Well, I have a soft spot for Louie.

462
00:21:50,472 --> 00:21:53,266
Okay. I know what we do.

463
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:57,410
Can I get a club soda for the lady
and a glass of pinot, please ?

464
00:21:58,152 --> 00:21:59,033
Thank you.

465
00:21:59,058 --> 00:22:00,168
Well, what's our plan ?

466
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:03,995
Well, I am your drunk boyfriend.

467
00:22:04,204 --> 00:22:05,073
Cheers.

468
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,832
Hey, lay off, already !

469
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,460
Good going, Curtis.

470
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:11,329
- What ?
- You're an idiot.

471
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,019
Come with me.

472
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:22,772
I'm sorry.

473
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:26,135
Give him any chance to
booze and he blows it.

474
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,261
Is it coming out ?

475
00:22:27,386 --> 00:22:28,620
Absolutely.

476
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:34,292
Not that it excuses his sloppy ass.

477
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:37,242
- There.
- I know the type.

478
00:22:38,517 --> 00:22:40,771
Probably out there hitting
on a bridesmaid right now.

479
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,194
You been with him long ?

480
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,374
Too long.

481
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:47,331
He's fun, cute, but...

482
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:50,184
he's always disappointing me.

483
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:52,444
Cowboy, huh ?

484
00:22:53,587 --> 00:22:56,047
Yeah, I don't know if they
turn into good husbands.

485
00:22:56,745 --> 00:22:58,148
I don't think so.

486
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:01,399
Well, my friends say
throw him back.

487
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,600
I agree.

488
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:04,656
Speaking from experience.

489
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,200
- You had one of these tools in your life ?
- Yeah.

490
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,545
I wasted a lot of time on him.

491
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:11,804
It end badly ?

492
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:13,249
You could say.

493
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,007
And you know what ?

494
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:18,823
The right guy was here all along.

495
00:23:25,476 --> 00:23:26,476
Anna !

496
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,357
Louie ?

497
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:31,887
- What are you...
- It's important.

498
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:36,556
<i>"You'll think of me"
by Keith Urban.</i>

499
00:23:39,165 --> 00:23:41,678
Okay, I know you only know
me from fire safety day.

500
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:42,547
Right.

501
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,456
But we've had talks and laughs.

502
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,942
And the field trip
with your students.

503
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:50,533
And-and-and getting pizza after.

504
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:51,479
That was fun.

505
00:23:51,504 --> 00:23:54,840
And-and sharing that
ridiculously giant orange crush,

506
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:56,260
'cause we both love it so much!

507
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:57,693
The forgotten soda.

508
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,813
That kind of good time
doesn't come along every day.

509
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,186
Louie, this is my rehearsal dinner.

510
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,652
That's why I'm here.

511
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:08,797
I gotta take my shot.

512
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,122
At what ?

513
00:24:12,236 --> 00:24:13,642
Marry me.

514
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:17,037
Are you joking ?

515
00:24:17,129 --> 00:24:21,099
Most people, they think I'm
an oddball, you know that ?

516
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:24,566
I don't know anything about you.

517
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:28,629
But you're interested
in my work and my dogs,

518
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:31,469
and chess strategies...

519
00:24:32,366 --> 00:24:33,900
I have to go back inside.

520
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:36,057
Hey, we have a rapport.

521
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:38,216
A wavelength !

522
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:42,120
I know once in a
lifetime when I find it.

523
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:45,390
And I'm here to grab my chance.

524
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:48,303
Go home, Louie.

525
00:24:58,357 --> 00:24:59,130
So...

526
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,406
You didn't meet just last year.

527
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,871
We tell people that, 'cause
it's easier than the real story.

528
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,655
That I married my stalker.

529
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,109
It's our little joke.

530
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:14,893
Funny.

531
00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:23,805
So, Louie crashed the place ?

532
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,790
He have a boom box
playing Peter Gabriel ?

533
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:28,826
Tried to steal Anna away.

534
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,069
She gave him the high hat-
go figure.

535
00:25:31,437 --> 00:25:33,105
Lloyd Dobler, incoming.

536
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,540
Hey, hey, you guys mind ?

537
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:37,909
Come on, here...

538
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,254
Thank you.

539
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,915
I didn't know I put you two
together.

540
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,227
Have a seat, Louie.

541
00:25:48,104 --> 00:25:50,322
So, tell us when you
really met Anna.

542
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,476
Whatcha mean ?

543
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:53,268
We're not buying the
whirlwind story.

544
00:25:53,393 --> 00:25:54,602
Methodical guy like you.

545
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:56,995
Figure there must be a
story behind the story.

546
00:25:58,274 --> 00:26:00,298
Are you guys working a case ?

547
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:02,467
At my wedding ?

548
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,713
Dan Palmer.

549
00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:08,657
Oh, geez.

550
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:11,619
Well, Louie, you went to
the hotel that night...

551
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:14,822
- Where he got killed.
- Ambushed Anna.

552
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,505
I was being romantic.

553
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,826
You got shut down.

554
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,568
Next stop, the groom ?

555
00:26:23,764 --> 00:26:26,525
I did see that guy
on the hotel steps.

556
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:28,293
Where he died.

557
00:26:28,395 --> 00:26:31,230
But he was good and
alive when I left.

558
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,273
You know she gives out Graham
crackers every Friday ?

559
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,142
What ?

560
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:49,495
Takes the lab goggles
home on the weekends,

561
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,216
and washes them for the kids.

562
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:53,051
Twenty pairs.

563
00:26:53,768 --> 00:26:55,420
Are you talking about Anna ?

564
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,991
I know these things about her.

565
00:27:02,018 --> 00:27:03,218
And I don't.

566
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,474
I hope you know she's special.

567
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,834
I hope you really love her.

568
00:27:10,665 --> 00:27:12,017
It sounds like you do.

569
00:27:12,142 --> 00:27:14,705
I'd make her happy everyday.

570
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:21,975
Hello, yeah.

571
00:27:24,461 --> 00:27:26,326
Melanie ? She asked for me ?

572
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,522
<i>"Demons" by Kenny Chesney.</i>

573
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:36,027
I was a fool, but I'm no killer.
You guys know me.

574
00:27:36,062 --> 00:27:37,829
Well, we also know
you lied about this.

575
00:27:37,863 --> 00:27:39,331
'Cause I was a fool !

576
00:27:39,365 --> 00:27:41,800
Plus, how am I getting
in that guy's hotel room?

577
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:45,237
- That's a good point.
- Bell. Shut up.

578
00:27:45,771 --> 00:27:47,839
- So, who was Melanie ?
- All I know

579
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:51,543
is an hour later,
the wedding was off.

580
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:54,212
God, and you guys
are all disinvited

581
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:56,448
to the champagne brunch tomorrow.

582
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,451
Hey, Louie.

583
00:28:04,823 --> 00:28:06,291
What did you do ?

584
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:08,727
New wrinkle with our dead groom.

585
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:10,762
Mystery woman reached out to him

586
00:28:10,797 --> 00:28:12,064
That night.

587
00:28:12,098 --> 00:28:13,565
Suddenly, Dan was out of there.

588
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,367
We're laying bets
on the doer, boss.

589
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:16,801
I got the skank.

590
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:18,303
- Bride.
- Mommy dearest.

591
00:28:18,338 --> 00:28:20,538
The winner gets a free
pass on the wedding gift.

592
00:28:21,573 --> 00:28:22,707
I'll go Phil.

593
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:24,142
Thought you bought his story.

594
00:28:24,176 --> 00:28:26,110
He's young, rich, good looking.

595
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:27,678
I don't like the guy.

596
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:31,950
Remember these, Joan ?

597
00:28:32,884 --> 00:28:34,285
You can't be here.

598
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,355
Want me to tell Anna
where I found them ?

599
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:38,790
Hey, Ed, let's take a walk.

600
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:40,892
- You're the double scotch.
- That's right.

601
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:42,627
Dance ?

602
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:43,995
Excuse me ?

603
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:45,730
My friend will take care of him.

604
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:47,398
Let me take care of you.

605
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,238
Now, you've had a few, Ed.

606
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,774
- A few drinks, a few sleepless nights.
- Du calme.

607
00:28:56,808 --> 00:28:59,043
Easy. Few too many years
protecting that battle-ax.

608
00:28:59,377 --> 00:29:01,179
Can I see those rings ?

609
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:02,980
Who are you, anyway ?

610
00:29:03,715 --> 00:29:05,951
I'm a homicide lieutenant;
I know about

611
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:07,820
Dan Palmer.

612
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:13,358
She was my wife,
so I didn't say anything.

613
00:29:14,193 --> 00:29:15,660
These were missing from his body.

614
00:29:15,695 --> 00:29:17,529
Turned up in her jewelry box.

615
00:29:17,963 --> 00:29:19,230
After Dan died ?

616
00:29:19,264 --> 00:29:21,866
I keep her dirty secret,
and what does she do ?

617
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:24,202
She cuts me out of Anna's life.

618
00:29:24,736 --> 00:29:27,272
Gets her thinking
I torpedoed the first wedding,

619
00:29:27,306 --> 00:29:29,241
and I don't even get
invited to this one.

620
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:31,443
Well, the truth will come out now.

621
00:29:31,477 --> 00:29:32,877
Oh, she can fly to hell.

622
00:29:32,912 --> 00:29:34,513
I don't care.

623
00:29:35,947 --> 00:29:37,416
But Anna...

624
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:45,724
I miss my girl.

625
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:51,797
Exes, huh ?

626
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,031
Miserable.

627
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:55,400
He knows what a big
night this is for me.

628
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:58,002
So, what were those rings about ?

629
00:29:58,637 --> 00:30:00,038
The past.

630
00:30:00,872 --> 00:30:02,340
Care to elaborate ?

631
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:05,043
It's nothing I'm proud of, Will.

632
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:07,845
You have to face it
to move on, Joan.

633
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,416
You're wise, aren't you ?

634
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,618
Learned a few things.

635
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:18,890
Do you believe that people are
better than their worst actions ?

636
00:30:19,325 --> 00:30:20,892
One hundred percent.

637
00:30:22,026 --> 00:30:23,495
My daughter...

638
00:30:25,397 --> 00:30:26,998
Tell me.

639
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:30,534
Her first fiance...

640
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:33,470
He sure had me fooled.

641
00:30:33,505 --> 00:30:35,573
I heard about that.

642
00:30:35,908 --> 00:30:36,808
Unforgivable.

643
00:30:36,842 --> 00:30:39,010
And I didn't think he
should get away with it.

644
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,214
Where do you think you're going ?

645
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:44,082
Home.

646
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,618
My daughter is in the bridal suite,

647
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:47,219
- a broken woman.
- I'm sorry.

648
00:30:47,252 --> 00:30:49,120
You're going to be
on the society pages tomorrow.

649
00:30:49,154 --> 00:30:51,623
- I'm a complete heel.
- 200 people are showing up at the church.

650
00:30:51,657 --> 00:30:53,224
I know, but I have to go.

651
00:30:53,258 --> 00:30:54,759
You may not do this to me.

652
00:30:54,793 --> 00:30:56,695
- To you ?
- You will be here. 10:00 A.M.

653
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,196
I'm gonna be long gone.

654
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,564
I'll pay you.

655
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,836
You can get divorced in a year.

656
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,304
Quietly, amicably.

657
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:07,906
Joan, please, just let me go.

658
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,841
We've paid for the rings,
the hotel...

659
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:12,143
They're yours.

660
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,513
I'm getting into the Milton club
this season, because my wedding

661
00:31:14,547 --> 00:31:16,281
is going to be the
event of the summer.

662
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:17,315
I cannot marry her.

663
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,350
Of course you can.

664
00:31:18,384 --> 00:31:20,352
I'm already married.

665
00:31:27,826 --> 00:31:29,627
Can we get a Brandy ?

666
00:31:30,262 --> 00:31:33,197
I never heard
that part of the story.

667
00:31:33,232 --> 00:31:35,166
Only Anna and I know that.

668
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,634
He told Anna ?

669
00:31:37,368 --> 00:31:39,871
He went right up to the
bridal suite to come clean.

670
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:41,906
And me ?

671
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,742
I just sat down and cried.

672
00:31:44,676 --> 00:31:47,245
I've been crying ever since.

673
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:50,615
So, Melanie's more
than a side girl.

674
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,584
She's a side wife.

675
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:54,786
So why can't we find her ?

676
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:58,723
I checked marriage
licenses in every state.

677
00:31:58,757 --> 00:31:59,558
Nothing.

678
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:01,259
Was he lying ?

679
00:32:01,394 --> 00:32:03,795
Get monster-in-law off his back ?

680
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:06,397
Well, either way,
this girl was big enough

681
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:07,899
in his life he dropped
everything for her.

682
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:08,867
Well, she's our key.

683
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:10,635
But she's a ghost.

684
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,805
We've got to get back for the cake.

685
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:16,608
Yeah. Wouldn't want to ruin
Louie's night.

686
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:26,384
It's Phil's myspace page
from college.

687
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:31,789
"Me, Dan and Mel."

688
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:37,294
She looks just like Anna.

689
00:32:55,595 --> 00:32:57,063
Who's the girl, Phil ?

690
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:03,036
- Where'd you get this ?
- Who's the girl ?

691
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:06,672
An old friend.

692
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:09,542
An old friend Dan just happened
to be married to ?

693
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:16,248
Hey.

694
00:33:16,282 --> 00:33:17,883
- Hey.
- To good guys,

695
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:18,918
Like Louie.

696
00:33:19,152 --> 00:33:21,254
Husband material.

697
00:33:22,088 --> 00:33:23,589
Unlike Dan.

698
00:33:25,124 --> 00:33:26,425
Did I tell you his name ?

699
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,095
Oh, bad enough he leaves
you at the altar, but...

700
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:31,364
Let's not talk about him.

701
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:33,299
But then he turns the knife.

702
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:36,268
"by the way, I'm already married."

703
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,671
I'd kill him, too.

704
00:33:39,705 --> 00:33:41,707
Yeah. He was married.

705
00:33:41,841 --> 00:33:42,842
To Melanie.

706
00:33:42,876 --> 00:33:44,710
It was a long time ago.
They were kids.

707
00:33:44,745 --> 00:33:47,179
And he thought that would
just get swept under the rug ?

708
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:49,415
I told you, Dan was a screwup.

709
00:33:50,949 --> 00:33:52,618
Anna was a new chapter.

710
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:54,353
Let's hear about the old one.

711
00:33:54,388 --> 00:33:56,121
I don't think I like you anymore.

712
00:33:56,856 --> 00:33:58,457
You don't have to like me.

713
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:00,359
You just have to talk.

714
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,535
She was from Baltimore.

715
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,938
They eloped.
Cancun, spring break.

716
00:34:13,272 --> 00:34:16,075
And he just forgot
to undo that mess,

717
00:34:16,209 --> 00:34:17,476
all those years later ?

718
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:18,978
It wasn't a mess.

719
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:20,946
They were in love.

720
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,581
So why not be with her ?

721
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:24,417
Why twist you around ?

722
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:28,353
'Cause something terrible happened.

723
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:34,760
It was years ago.

724
00:34:34,794 --> 00:34:36,129
College.

725
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:44,870
And you've been with her
this whole time ?

726
00:34:44,904 --> 00:34:47,073
You know I have been with you.

727
00:34:47,207 --> 00:34:49,174
Haven't you ever heard of divorce ?

728
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,176
I couldn't do that.

729
00:34:52,211 --> 00:34:54,046
But you could lie to me.

730
00:34:54,281 --> 00:34:57,050
Anna, she's in a hospital.

731
00:34:58,084 --> 00:34:59,852
She has been for eight years.

732
00:35:00,186 --> 00:35:01,454
Why ?

733
00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:03,255
There was an accident.

734
00:35:03,489 --> 00:35:04,456
In Mexico.

735
00:35:04,491 --> 00:35:06,625
We were on a boat, drinking.

736
00:35:08,827 --> 00:35:10,095
And ?

737
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,864
She almost drowned.

738
00:35:12,098 --> 00:35:14,901
And they saved her,
physically, but...

739
00:35:15,435 --> 00:35:19,505
she never came back, otherwise.

740
00:35:19,939 --> 00:35:23,142
The first three years,
I visited her every day.

741
00:35:23,376 --> 00:35:26,212
She was there, but she wasn't.

742
00:35:28,348 --> 00:35:31,383
And she's still in Baltimore ?

743
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:36,488
God, I tried to move on.

744
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:38,623
Coming to Philly.

745
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:40,626
New place, new chance.

746
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,295
And meeting you, I felt good again.

747
00:35:44,797 --> 00:35:46,465
Glad I could help out.

748
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:49,301
I wanted to start over with you.

749
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:52,338
That's what I want.

750
00:35:52,573 --> 00:35:55,674
But I can't get over it.

751
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:58,177
And tonight, a nurse called.

752
00:35:58,211 --> 00:36:00,313
She asked for me.

753
00:36:01,748 --> 00:36:04,516
She's never done
that in eight years.

754
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:07,786
And that's why your bag is packed.

755
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,022
I have to go to her.

756
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:16,228
My parents spent a zillion dollars

757
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:17,563
on this thing.

758
00:36:17,798 --> 00:36:20,799
Every loved one I have is here.

759
00:36:21,234 --> 00:36:24,436
And you're leaving
in the 25th hour,

760
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:27,506
for a girl who's been gone
for eight years ?

761
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,675
You must be crazy.

762
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:31,944
I'm sorry.

763
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,349
Just...

764
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,850
get your ass out the door !

765
00:36:46,892 --> 00:36:48,994
Not a graceful good-bye.

766
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:50,729
I could see doing worse.

767
00:36:50,763 --> 00:36:52,230
But I didn't.

768
00:36:52,665 --> 00:36:54,700
And actually...

769
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:57,302
I understand now.

770
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:01,206
He loved her.

771
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:04,176
He loved her.

772
00:37:04,211 --> 00:37:07,513
And he wanted to love Anna,
who looked just like her ?

773
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:10,115
- He was trying to get it back.
- Right.

774
00:37:10,649 --> 00:37:12,784
I knew the second
I saw Anna...

775
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:14,753
He was never going to
go through with it.

776
00:37:14,788 --> 00:37:16,121
So he headed to Baltimore ?

777
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:17,689
With Phil.

778
00:37:17,724 --> 00:37:19,725
Best man to the end.

779
00:37:21,494 --> 00:37:23,362
More credit card research, Phil.

780
00:37:23,396 --> 00:37:24,630
Is that right ?

781
00:37:24,664 --> 00:37:26,331
Two amtrak tickets to Baltimore.

782
00:37:26,366 --> 00:37:27,566
Purchased in the wee hours,

783
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,034
night Dan hit the dirt.

784
00:37:29,268 --> 00:37:30,702
Well, sounds like you
were gonna hightail it

785
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:32,271
with the runaway groom.

786
00:37:32,305 --> 00:37:34,506
Makes you the last to see.

787
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,376
I told you, I tried to reason
with Dan...

788
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,445
You tell us things, Phil,
but you don't.

789
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:42,780
Like you say there was
an accident in Cancun,

790
00:37:42,815 --> 00:37:45,017
but you don't say
that you were there.

791
00:37:46,151 --> 00:37:48,788
At the wheel of the boat,
as a matter of fact.

792
00:37:51,824 --> 00:37:53,925
That's not something
you want to relive.

793
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,062
Wrecking a girl's life.

794
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,534
And your best friend's.

795
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,573
In fact, you'd do a lot to
never talk about it again.

796
00:38:08,107 --> 00:38:10,742
Another half-truth
I'm stumbling on, Phil ?

797
00:38:11,076 --> 00:38:12,511
You told us about Melanie.

798
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:13,478
Finally.

799
00:38:13,513 --> 00:38:16,648
But not that you
called her that night.

800
00:38:16,683 --> 00:38:19,651
3:11 a.M...

801
00:38:19,986 --> 00:38:21,353
You call the hospital.

802
00:38:21,387 --> 00:38:22,821
Four minutes later, Dan is dead.

803
00:38:24,355 --> 00:38:27,092
But you had a key
to the hotel room.

804
00:38:27,726 --> 00:38:29,061
You were with him.

805
00:38:29,095 --> 00:38:30,762
Calling his old girl.

806
00:38:30,797 --> 00:38:32,898
Why ?

807
00:38:35,668 --> 00:38:38,937
I been asking myself that
same question ever since.

808
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:46,778
You don't want to do this.

809
00:38:47,513 --> 00:38:48,880
I don't ?

810
00:38:49,115 --> 00:38:50,582
New chapter.

811
00:38:50,617 --> 00:38:51,750
Right ?

812
00:38:51,784 --> 00:38:54,620
I don't want to see Melanie
after eight years ?

813
00:38:54,654 --> 00:38:55,554
Dan, she's gone.

814
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:57,923
She asked for me.

815
00:38:57,957 --> 00:38:59,124
We both visited

816
00:38:59,158 --> 00:39:00,158
all those years.

817
00:39:00,193 --> 00:39:01,326
She never knew you.

818
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:04,596
And-and-and... Now she does.

819
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:06,065
I don't believe that.

820
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:09,534
So, move on, right ?

821
00:39:09,569 --> 00:39:11,536
Even though she's all I ever wanted ?

822
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:13,238
But you can't have her.

823
00:39:13,272 --> 00:39:15,974
And whose fault is that ?

824
00:39:16,843 --> 00:39:18,810
You know I'm sorry.

825
00:39:18,845 --> 00:39:20,545
But we can't bring her back.

826
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,947
She is back.

827
00:39:21,981 --> 00:39:23,115
She said my name.

828
00:39:23,149 --> 00:39:25,183
You heard the doc,
this is not possible...

829
00:39:25,218 --> 00:39:26,785
A nurse called me !

830
00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:28,153
Dan ! Face it !

831
00:39:28,187 --> 00:39:30,589
There is nothing for you
in Baltimore.

832
00:39:33,225 --> 00:39:34,926
I guess I'm going alone, then.

833
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:36,561
Okay, you know what ?

834
00:39:36,596 --> 00:39:37,829
Let's call her.

835
00:39:37,864 --> 00:39:39,131
What are you doing ?

836
00:39:39,165 --> 00:39:40,999
No, let's see if she suddenly
remembers you, Dan.

837
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:43,101
Let's see if Melanie
miraculously returned

838
00:39:43,136 --> 00:39:44,703
from her eight-year wasteland.

839
00:39:51,511 --> 00:39:53,645
Hello.

840
00:39:55,415 --> 00:39:57,516
Yeah, it's-it's Dan Palmer.

841
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,384
We-we talked earlier.

842
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:02,554
How is she ?

843
00:40:11,763 --> 00:40:12,998
Yeah.

844
00:40:14,433 --> 00:40:16,034
Thanks.

845
00:40:20,807 --> 00:40:22,908
You... You're right.

846
00:40:25,178 --> 00:40:27,345
We're not going to Baltimore.

847
00:40:28,414 --> 00:40:30,382
Look, I'll...

848
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:31,917
I'll order us some coffee.

849
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:33,285
We'll-we'll talk.

850
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:36,555
We'll... get things
back on track.

851
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:50,435
Dan, what are you doing ?

852
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:56,975
She died.

853
00:40:57,009 --> 00:40:58,243
What ?

854
00:40:58,277 --> 00:41:00,278
They say it happens sometimes,

855
00:41:00,313 --> 00:41:02,481
Right before death.

856
00:41:03,415 --> 00:41:04,483
Clarity.

857
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:06,318
Dan...

858
00:41:07,152 --> 00:41:08,720
Clarity.

859
00:41:09,555 --> 00:41:10,756
Wait.

860
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,157
Dan. Dan !

861
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:13,626
No !

862
00:41:44,891 --> 00:41:48,059
<i>"Out last night"
by Kenny Chesney.</i>

863
00:41:58,104 --> 00:42:01,106
* We went out last night *

864
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,509
* Like we swore we wouldn't do *

865
00:42:04,744 --> 00:42:07,612
* Drank too much beer last night *

866
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:11,383
* A lot more than we wanted to *

867
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:15,554
* There were girls from
Argentina and Arkansas *

868
00:42:15,588 --> 00:42:18,990
* Maine, Alabama and Panama *

869
00:42:19,025 --> 00:42:23,328
* All mixed together
and having a ball *

870
00:42:23,362 --> 00:42:28,065
* Yeah, we went out last night *

871
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,002
* One thing started
leading to another *

872
00:42:31,037 --> 00:42:34,840
* Out last night *

873
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:37,475
* Hitting on everybody
and their mother *

874
00:42:37,509 --> 00:42:40,946
* There were two karaoke
girls drunk on a dare *

875
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,583
* Singing "I got you babe"
by Ssonny and Cher *

876
00:42:44,617 --> 00:42:46,584
* Yeah, life was good everywhere *

877
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,655
* We went out last night *

878
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:54,192
* Well, the fact that
I'm still breathing *

879
00:42:54,227 --> 00:42:58,330
* Means that I must have survived *

880
00:42:58,364 --> 00:43:06,004
* And that I lived to go out
with my friends again tonight *

881
00:43:06,038 --> 00:43:10,742
* Oh, we went out last night *

882
00:43:10,776 --> 00:43:13,511
* One thing started
leading to another *

883
00:43:13,546 --> 00:43:16,982
* Out last night *

884
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:20,151
* Everybody started
loving on each other *

885
00:43:20,186 --> 00:43:23,788
* They were dancing on the
tables and howling at the moon *

886
00:43:23,823 --> 00:43:26,625
* Pairing off together
and pretty soon *

887
00:43:26,659 --> 00:43:28,927
* There was not a soul in sight *

888
00:43:28,961 --> 00:43:32,564
* When we went out last night. *
