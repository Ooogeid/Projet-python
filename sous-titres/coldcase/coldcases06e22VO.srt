00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,480
I can see from down there
that you have not shaved.

4
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,800
Why is that ?

5
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,510
Why are you staring at me ?

6
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,980
Do you think I am attractive ?

7
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,410
You better tuck in that bottom lip.

8
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,110
Double time and down to the quad.

9
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,390
Is that understand ?

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,770
Sir, yes, sir !

11
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,980
Go !

15
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,150
Caretaker relocating graves
came across a bastard coffin.

16
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,170
No headstone.

17
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:55,771
Perfect place to bury a body.

18
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,960
CSU found a duffel bag

19
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:00,761
and personal items buried
underneath the box.

20
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,810
Idiot bag.
Bears a book of knowledge

21
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,511
to be worn by knobs at all times.

22
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,970
- Knobs ?
- First-year cadets,

23
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:09,971
military school.

24
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,840
Shave their heads to look like knobs.

25
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,550
Well, this knob got a name ?

26
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,310
ID says Kate Butler.

27
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,911
Parents reported her missing
three years ago from...

28
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,030
Pennsylvania Military Institute.

29
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,640
Oh, I remember this girl.

30
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,150
One of the first females
admitted to PMI.

31
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:26,251
It took a lot of guts.

32
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,780
PMI. That's in what,
Bucks County ?

33
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,100
How she wind up out here ?

34
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,660
Weekend leave in the city ?

35
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,230
Except this box is a
military footlocker.

36
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,970
Issued by the school.

37
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,220
Fractured skull,
possible blunt-force trauma.

38
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,280
Could be our murder weapon
right here...

39
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,940
seven-pound hand weight
with her initials on it.

40
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,380
Yeah, we'll have those
examined for blood or hair.

41
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,200
Corroded laptop, clothes.

42
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,290
Made it look like she ran away.

43
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,460
Got her in there without
cutting up the body.

44
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,730
Had to be before rigor set in.

45
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,870
So she's murdered on campus,
stuffed in a footlocker.

46
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,700
Driven all the way out here,
30 miles away ?

47
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,800
Hoping it would never
get tied back to the school.

48
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,010
Well, it just did.

00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,220
The Long Blue Line

52
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,070
All-male for 162 years.

53
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,920
Well, mid -'90s,

54
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:52,421
Justice Department forced
almost every state military academy

55
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,421
to admit qualified female
applicants.

56
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,150
Even Valley Forge and
the Citadel are coed now.

57
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,750
PMI was one of the last holdouts
till four years ago.

58
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,900
Can't believethis is still an issue.

59
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,570
Male institutions dragging
their feet to admit women ?

60
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,160
Yeah, glad that's behind us.

61
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,000
Next thing you know, they'll
start letting 'em be detectives.

62
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,460
Kate Butler was
one of two female cadets

63
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:14,261
who entered PMI
in the fall of '05.

64
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,300
Missing clothes, laptop.

65
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,750
Assigned figured she ran away.

66
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,680
Well, the body changes all that.

67
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,320
What happened to the other girl ?

68
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,440
Courtney Gaines. Went into
the infirmary after the first day,

69
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,641
gone within a week.

70
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,710
Butler almost made it
to Thanksgiving.

71
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,890
School reported her missing

72
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:30,891
when she didn't show up
for chapel on Sunday morning.

73
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,380
Campus computer system

74
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:36,381
had her swiping out her ID card
at the front gate night before, 8:26 p.m.

75
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,100
Well, ID was found with the body.

76
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,700
Possible her killer swiped
her card on the way out ?

77
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,380
Used the footlocker to get
the body off campus,

78
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:43,881
but he still needed a car.

79
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,280
I'll look into parking permits.

80
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,390
Victim's father's downstairs,
just coming from the morgue.

81
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,330
Mother's on her way in now.

82
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,520
Separated when they lost their daughter.

83
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,840
Autopsy report.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,330
ME confirmed blunt-force trauma.

85
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,250
Kate's hand weight
matched the contusion.

86
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,360
Could have been killed in her own room.

87
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,980
Had a stress fracture in her pelvis.

88
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,690
Undetermined cause.
Possible sexual assault ?

89
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,520
I'll check the PMI infirmary records.

90
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,300
Latest from the crime scene.

91
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,800
Thanks. How you doing ?

92
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Billy moved out this morning.

93
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,650
Finally asked him for a divorce.

94
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,990
I didn't know
you were gonna do that.

95
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,060
Ah, I know, right ?

96
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,930
Time to move on.

97
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,400
Yeah.

98
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,070
- So, um, see you around ?
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.

99
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,490
Still have her room
the way it was.

100
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,980
Every time the phone rang,
a little part of me...

101
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,920
hoping it was her, you know ?

102
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,640
We're thinking she may have been
killed on campus, Mrs. Butler.

103
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,030
Have you informed her father yet ?

104
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,350
He's handling the identification.

105
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,350
Nothing he loved more
than that school.

106
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,760
Lot of folks have a problem
with her attending PMI ?

107
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,990
Including her own father.

108
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,210
He never wanted Kate to go
there in the first place.

109
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,840
His alma mater.

110
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,070
She was just as stubborn as he was.

111
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,810
Force of her own.

112
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,890
Never even told us
she was applying

113
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:18,091
till after she was accepted.

114
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,100
Mr. Butler was concerned
for her safety ?

115
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,110
Concern for his daughter ?

116
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,250
You'd have to ask him.

117
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,760
Graduated in '78
before I got my commission.

118
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,370
I went to PMI because
that's where my father went.

119
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,650
His father before him.

120
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,560
Footlocker we found her body in
was from PMI, Mr. Butler.

121
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,700
I think that's how the killer
got her body off campus.

122
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,320
I don't want Charlotte to
ever see those pictures.

123
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,180
So, how she holding up ?

124
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,650
Well, she said you never wanted
Kate to go to PMI,

125
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:07,451
that you had a difficult relationship
with your daughter.

126
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,750
I knew what she was gonna
be up against.

127
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,560
She did it to prove me wrong.

128
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,600
Her mother blamed me
for what happened.

129
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,590
Why would she blame you ?

130
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,280
She didn't tell you ?

131
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,540
Kate would have done anything
for her father,

132
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:25,041
but you don't defy Hank Butler.

133
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,550
She'd made up her mind.

134
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,620
I always sided with my husband,

135
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:33,321
but there comes a time when a child
needs more than just tough love.

136
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,350
<i>"Come Back" by Pearl Jam</i>

137
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,780
Hank ?

138
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,190
Your daughter's going off
to college.

139
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,910
Do you intend to say good-bye
to her ?

140
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,900
Dadd That I feel I know you
don't want me to do this.

141
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,590
I just want you to know...

142
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,240
I'm not gonna let you down.

143
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,250
Good-bye, Daddy.

144
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,830
If you can't hack it,
don't bother coming home.

145
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,890
Do you think that was...

146
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,010
an ultimatum or
a means of motivation ?

147
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,330
Either way,

148
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:35,631
I always thought it was the reason
my baby never came back.

149
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,070
Blamed your husband for that.

150
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,080
Kate didn't need any
more people against her.

151
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,270
This is all the hate mail she got

152
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:47,271
before she even set foot
on campus.

153
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,880
Did you show these
to the police before ?

154
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,380
They said they looked into it.

155
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,940
They told us that she ran away.

156
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,180
I guess that's not true now, is it ?

157
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,110
Did you talk
to Commandant Murillo ?

158
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,280
We will.

159
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,030
Thanks for coming in, M. Butler.

160
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,540
Sure.

161
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,980
You better find the son of a
bitch who did this before I do.

162
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,230
When Cadet Butler didn't return
to campus,

163
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:49,631
we assumed that she'd eventually
show up on her parents' doorstep.

164
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,320
Got new information indicates she
may have been killed on campus.

165
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,090
I find that hard to believe.

166
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,250
First year is difficult,

167
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,651
but we have standards of safety
for all cadets,

168
00:10:58,651 --> 00:10:59,851
male or female.

169
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,970
But there are no female cadets
presently enrolled ?

170
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,180
Yes, well, it's a rather
limited applicant pool.

171
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,270
Maybe if you put a woman
on your brochure,

172
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:09,271
see what happens.

173
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,670
Gonna need access to
all school records and grounds.

174
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,340
I've been ordered to give
you whatever you need.

175
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,040
Cadet Gardner here
will show you to Moe.

176
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,610
He's my Operations Officer.

177
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,830
Now, if you'll excuse me...

178
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,700
Attention on the quad !

179
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,250
All hail the Commandant.

180
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,340
Saw a bumper sticker on the lot.

181
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,290
God, country and PMI.

182
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,430
Gotta figure the Commandant's
next on that list.

183
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,450
Thought they were supposed
to look straight ahead.

184
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,510
Sir, not every day a pretty blonde
walks across campus, sir.

185
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,290
Of course I remember
Kate Butler.

186
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,200
It was my job to implement
the necessary changes

187
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:46,701
to accommodate female cadets
on campus.

188
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,170
I don't think these were the
accommodations she had in mind.

189
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,320
Got a way to track
that footlocker, Moe ?

190
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,940
Please.

191
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,150
Two in every room,

192
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:58,351
but we don't assign them
to any particular cadet.

193
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,070
One goes missing,
who requisitions a replacement ?

194
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,350
No inventory.

195
00:12:02,451 --> 00:12:04,651
We just replace them as they fall apart
at the end of the year.

196
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,370
Must be thousands of them.

197
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,130
Sounds odd for a place that
keeps such meticulous records.

198
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,550
Like the computer log
you supplied back in '05.

199
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,200
Showed the exact time
Kate left campus.

200
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,920
It goes into a computer any time a cadet
swipes their ID at the front gate.

201
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:18,921
On or off campus.

202
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,930
We're gonna need
a list of registered cars

203
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:22,331
and parking permits that year.

204
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,460
Infirmary records,any injuries
Kate may have incurred.

205
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,630
Whatever you need.

206
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,580
- Lawrence.
- Yes, Major.

207
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,770
You know if Kate had any
problems with another cadet ?

208
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,050
Every fourth class cadet
has a rough go of it.

209
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,740
More a function of being a knob.
It's not personal.

210
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,850
What about the function
of being a girl ?

211
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,200
That get personal ?

212
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,490
Well, she never filed a complaint.

213
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,300
Look, I'd be lying to you to say
there wasn't resentment

214
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:46,401
among some of the cadets.

215
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,590
Why ? She get special consideration ?

216
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,130
It didn't matter much.

217
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,830
That girl was determined
to be one of the guys.

218
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,540
<i>"Who You Are" by Pearl Jam</i>

219
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,620
Major, it is still too long.

220
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,600
How short do you want it,
Commandant ?

221
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,080
I have no idea.

222
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,800
She still looks like a girl.

223
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,030
With all due respect, sir,
she is a girl.

224
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,350
And we don't have a female precedent.

225
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,030
Courtney. Don't.

226
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,100
Don't what ?

227
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,000
Well, keep cutting
till we find one.

228
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,370
I'm gonna be a knob,
I might as well look like one.

229
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,750
Still, cutting your hair doesn't mean
you can cut the mustard here at PMI.

230
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,170
This program is just too
demanding for most women.

231
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,960
- Kate have a boyfriend on campus ?
- No, ma'am.

232
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,210
We instituted a non-fraternization
policy

233
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,411
the year women were admitted.

234
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,120
Yeah, 'cause those always work.

235
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,900
Damned if you do,
damned if you don't, Detective.

236
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,240
We'd like to see her room.

237
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,930
- Lawrence, show them the barracks.
- Yes, sir.

238
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,880
"A cadet shall not lie, cheat, or steal,
nor shall he tolerate those who do."

239
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,560
Honor code. Noticed they
got one in every building.

240
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,210
Single sanction policy, ma'am.
One violation gets you drummed out.

241
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,260
Pretty strict code
for most mortals.

242
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,840
That's why on the eighth day,
God created PMI.

243
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,790
This the only dorm room
with a lock on the door ?

244
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,270
Yes, sir, first one
installed in school history.

245
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,990
Along with a special latrine
bathroom for women down the hall.

246
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,850
Room's been unoccupied

247
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,351
since Cadet Butler
and the other girl left.

248
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,050
The other girl ?

249
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,270
Courtney Gaines ?

250
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,750
Yes, ma'am, non-hacker.

251
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,540
Cadet Butler only shared
a room the first week.

252
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,880
Tell the commandant this
is now a crime scene.

253
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,050
Yes, sir.

254
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,100
I think it's time we
talk to Courtney Gaines.

255
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,200
I transferred to Bryn Mawr
my freshman year

256
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:06,501
to major in women's studies.

257
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,900
Quite a contrast, going from an all-male
military academy

258
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,801
to a women's college, Courtney.

259
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,330
I'm writing my senior thesis on
the merits of single-sex education.

260
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,440
Which one ?

261
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,760
Women's colleges only graduate 4%
of the country's female students

262
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,820
but they produce 25%
of the female board members

263
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,621
of Fortune 500 companies,

264
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,810
50% of the women in Congress.

265
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,030
I know where my daughter's going.

266
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,800
How did you get along with Kate ?

267
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,720
Oh, she was a great girl,
tried to help me.

268
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,580
I thought going to a school
like PMI would be empowering.

269
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,020
Instead I spent half my
time in the infirmary.

270
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,660
- What happened ?
- Hell Week.

271
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,010
Marching, pushups, more marching.

272
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,810
Suffered a stress fracture in my pelvis.

273
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,950
Kate had the same injury.

274
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,480
Women's legs are shorter

275
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,781
so, we have t take longer stride
to keep up,

276
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,090
but the physical abuse
was nothing

277
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,991
compared to
the psychological assault.

278
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,030
Maybe 'cause
Kate's father went there,

279
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:58,831
she was more prepared.

280
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,780
She knew how to survive.

281
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,470
Actually, neither one of you
survived the school.

282
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,500
But at least you're still
sitting here.

283
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,410
What do you mean ?

284
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,090
Kate's body just turned up
in a cemetery.

285
00:16:09,091 --> 00:16:09,991
Oh, my God.

286
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,430
Anyone in particular you can remember
gunning for her, Courtney ?

287
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,560
Yeah, I do.

288
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,760
He hated both of us on sight.

289
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,310
I'll never forget his face.

290
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,150
In what year was my beloved
institution founded ?

291
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,230
Fatbody ?

292
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,690
Sir, Eighteen-forty...
something, sir.

293
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,900
Cadet "Chucklehead"

294
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:38,901
has just desecrated the very ground
upon which you worthless knobs stand.

295
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,570
For that, you owe me 20
more pushups.

296
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,180
Eat floor, knobs ! Exercise !

297
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,650
What we obtain too cheap,
we esteem too lightly.

298
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,590
Come on. Get up. You can do it.
You can hack it !

299
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,330
I can't... can't do it.

300
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,670
This ain't yoga class,
downward dog !

301
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,370
Get your ass out of the air
and do a man's pushup !

302
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,400
You gonna spend another night crying
in the infirmary, Cadet "Useless" ?

303
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,980
That's what I thought.

304
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,350
You all right ?

305
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,310
Shut up. Don't even look at me
before he comes over here and...

306
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,390
"Eight-Ball", did you just blow
chunks on my fine quadrangle ?

307
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,430
Sir, yes, sir ! Sorry, sir.

308
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,310
Are you suggesting
that my mess hall

309
00:17:20,311 --> 00:17:22,611
doesn't quite measure up
to your mama's home cooking ?

310
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,890
Do you need a bib ?!

311
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,120
Sir, no, sir !

312
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,390
How about you, Sinead ?

313
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,070
You wanna gimme some tears ?
Make me feel sorry for you ?

314
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,760
Sir, no, sir !

315
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,990
You see this ring ?

316
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:34,591
You think I busted my ass
for three long years

317
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,330
just to see them give it away to a
bunch of sports bra-wearing pantywaists ?

318
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,060
Only way you're getting one
is through me,

319
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,261
and that ain't gonna happen.

320
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,260
Sergeant James Addison.

321
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,390
Still have nightmares about that guy.

322
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,040
Made it clear it was you or him.

323
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,600
The day I walked out,
every guy in the place cheered.

324
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,420
Kate stayed.
God knows why.

325
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,890
Did Addison threaten you
personally ?

326
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,220
Visited me in the infirmary.

327
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,560
Told me to leave now and walk
out through the front gates...

328
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,370
or be carried out in a box.

329
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,330
First Lieutenant James Addison ?

330
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,170
I help you ?

331
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,650
Detectives Rush, Valens.
Philly Homicide.

332
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,960
You're here about Cadet Butler.

333
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,640
Word travels fast.
Graduated two years ago.

334
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,810
Still hanging around ?

335
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,000
Grad program, engenering.

336
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,990
Finished my first tour in Afghanistan.

337
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,990
Get free room
as resident hall director.

338
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,390
How well did you know Kate ?

339
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,300
I was part of the Echo Company cadre.

340
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,830
Saw her every day during Hell Week.

341
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:51,831
Not much after that.

342
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,280
I heard you took special pride
in racking knobs,

343
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:55,681
especially the female kind.

344
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,980
Made it your mission to run them off.
Guess it worked.

345
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,090
I didn't treat the women
different than any other knob.

346
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,490
Courtney Gaines says otherwise.

347
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,080
Hell, yeah, I tried to run 'em out,

348
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:05,681
tried to run 'em all out.
It was my job.

349
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,060
Break down the individual,
build up the group ?

350
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,920
Whiny maggots call it hazing.

351
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,100
I call it natural selection.

352
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,060
But then, Courtney was no Kate Butler.

353
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,830
What was different about Cadet Butler ?

354
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,620
She understood what it took to
earn the respect of her peers.

355
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,360
How'd Butler rank first
in the two-mile run ?

356
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,970
She finished sixth.

357
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,270
Called gender-norming, "Chucklehead".

358
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,090
Women automatically get two
minutes shaved off their time.

359
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,960
What, one for each knocker ?

360
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,600
You're up first, you gaudy smack !

361
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,440
Get on that bar and
give me ten pull-ups.

362
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,050
Yes, sir !

363
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,220
You have got
to be kidding me, fish !

364
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,120
Only girls and gumps
do the flexed arm hang.

365
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,330
Hold it right there, Gomer.
Get up there, Butler.

366
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,770
Sir, yes, sir.

367
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,710
Let's see if you girls
can hang for a full minute.

368
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,860
Let the girl beat you ?!

369
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,440
Come on ! Pull it up !

370
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,380
You are a no-go at
this station, Stewart !

371
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,840
Get off my bar, you fat tub of goo !

372
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,430
- Get back in formation.
- Sir, yes, sir.

373
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,690
Butler knew that as long as
there was gender-norming,

374
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:32,691
she'd never be equal.

375
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,200
Had to respect the effort.
Even if "Rhianna" never lived it down.

376
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,270
"Rhianna" ?

377
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,460
That's what they called
Ryan after Kate smoked him.

378
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,030
Drove the kid nuts.

379
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,530
Where's this "Rhianna" now ?

380
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,390
First class cadet. Senior.

381
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,390
His folks live upstate.

382
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,530
Went home to visit.

383
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,240
Due back tomorrow before first call.

384
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,720
Is that a sign-out sheet ?

385
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,540
Yeah, cadets have to
sign in and out

386
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,341
of the barracks on weekends.

387
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,530
You know, I don't mind standing
the duty.

388
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,810
I basically get paid to study.

389
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,610
Different from the ID
swipe at the front gate ?

390
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,190
The ID swipe's to get on and off campus.

391
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,990
Barracks log is for curfew purposes.

392
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,980
School keep track of these ?

393
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,660
Collected every Sunday morning,

394
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:10,661
filed over in the main office.

395
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,930
Remember where you were the
Saturday night Kate disappeared ?

396
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,650
Saturday night ?

397
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,300
Would have been out drinking
with the guys in Echo.

398
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:17,601
It's mandatory around here.

399
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,170
Good. Then you'll remember
their names.

400
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,330
Hey, I have Kate's medical
records from the PMI infirmary.

401
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,530
Usual bruises and blisters

402
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:31,531
except the 18 stitches she needed
for a gash in her hand

403
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:33,632
two weeks before she disappeared.

404
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,660
Little rough for regular PT.

405
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,990
Told the doctor on
duty she broke a bottle.

406
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,260
I'm thinking possible defensive wounds.

407
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,720
It makes you wonder why the hell
she wanted to go to this school.

408
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,610
Get anything from the hate mail ?

409
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,650
Uh, yeah, a lot of folks
with serious issues.

410
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,470
Here's one blowhard...

411
00:21:51,471 --> 00:21:54,271
threatened to have Kate
drawn and quartered

412
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:57,172
for taking the spot of
"more qualified young men".

413
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,120
Postmark's from one of those office
postage machines.

414
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,721
Worth tracking.

415
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,850
Nutjob #2 thinks
Kate going to PMI

416
00:22:05,851 --> 00:22:08,651
is a breach of the garden of Eden.

417
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:15,010
"He placed on the east side of the
garden of Eden angels and a flaming sword

418
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,410
flashing back and forth to
guard the way to the tree of life."

419
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,650
Well, there's six of them
with the same sword business.

420
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,470
All sent out on a Saturday.

421
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,230
It could be a cadet
off-campus on open weekends ?

422
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,730
Hate mail on Saturday,
chapel on Sunday.

423
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,620
These guys are unbelievable.

424
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,260
I believe it.

425
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,880
You're tellin' me this kind of stuff
happened to you back in the day ?

426
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,130
First female in Homicide.

427
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,600
Remember Walter Harris ?

428
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,240
Detective retired in '02 ?

429
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,220
Sure, was the Walrus.

430
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,760
Legend with the practical jokes.

431
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,910
Oh, he was funny, all right.
Had a joke for me every day.

432
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,170
PMS, my social life,
my ass, you name it.

433
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,280
You're kidding.

434
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,520
No ,I rolled with it 'cause
that's what you do, right ?

435
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,240
Even rolled with it
when he put

436
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,941
a centerfold with my face on it
on the fridge.

437
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,000
Till this one night

438
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:06,601
I'm down in the Bottom
picking up a 6'4" meth-head.

439
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,990
I turn around,
I got no backup.

440
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,740
Walter hung you out to dry.

441
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,190
You report his ass ?

442
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,710
Figured it'd only get worse.

443
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,210
Least I was 29.

444
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,640
Kate was only 18.

445
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,780
I'll hit PMI in the morning,
talk to Ryan Stewart.

446
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,860
See if "Rhianna" ever lived
his nickname down.

447
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,480
- Night, dollface.
- Night.

448
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,370
Philly Homicide.
Rise and shine, "Rhianna".

449
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,110
What the hell is this ?

450
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,360
Know you got a busy schedule.

451
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:55,161
Figured we'd talk to you
before first call.

452
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,280
- Remember Kate Butler ?
- Kate's dead ?

453
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,000
Found her in a footlocker.

454
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,700
You reported yours missing knob year.

455
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,480
I reported all my furniture missing, sir.

456
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,160
They used to put it out on the quad while
I was asleep, sometimes with me in it.

457
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,440
Where were you the night
she disappeared ?

458
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,000
Don't know. My room ?
Where I always was.

459
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,760
"Rhianna". Pretty nickname.
Cadets still call u that ?

460
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,290
No, not if they want to keep
their teeth, ma'am.

461
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,850
Kate stuck you with that name.
Dusted you off good.

462
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,280
Lit a fire under my ass.
I bench over 300 pounds now.

463
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,700
Forgive and forget ?
How sweet.

464
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,340
I busted my hump to make it this far.

465
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,050
I'm gonna graduate on time
with a ring.

466
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,260
Congratulations.

467
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,230
Kate's pushing up daisies.

468
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,400
Look, it wasn't... it wasn't the students
that Kate Butler had to worry about.

469
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,880
Who was it ?

470
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,390
Kate was a member
of the "Color Guard".

471
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,080
Most cadets,
it was a time to shine.

472
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,170
But Kate dreaded it...

473
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:41,100
<i>"Rear View Mirror" by Pearl Jam</i>

474
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,430
Hell you think you are,
performing with the color guard ?

475
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,360
You aren't fit to touch that flag.

476
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,720
Just trying to do my job, sir.

477
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,930
Yeah, well, it's bad enough
a guy's denied a place

478
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:04,231
to let some bitch like you in.

479
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,160
You're a disgrace to the long blue
line of men who wear this ring !

480
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,050
You hear me ?

481
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,490
The guy did the same thing
to her every single game.

482
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,960
There was nothing she could do about it.

483
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,590
She'd get in trouble if
she fell out of formation.

484
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,570
- Yeah, no one had her back.
- No one knew what to do.

485
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,930
I mean, that type of thing
didn't happen with the guys.

486
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,690
Loudmouth with the ring,
he alumni ?

487
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,650
Yes, ma'am, Jeb something.

488
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,660
Drunk still comes to every game.

489
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,580
Jebediah Buford. PMI class of '82.

490
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,020
Works on the tenth floor.

491
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,340
Genius who sent the anonymous
hate mail letter

492
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,241
using his office postage machine.

493
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,700
Just talked to Moe.
Qualified young men he was ranting about?

494
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,610
He's talking about his own son.

495
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,780
Letter from PMI admissions.

496
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,030
Brandon Buford,

497
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:55,231
wait-listed the same year
Kate was accepted.

498
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,680
Kid never got in.
Legacy or not.

499
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,010
Check out the Bufords'
home address on the top.

500
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,580
19128 Roxborough.

501
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,760
Four blocks from the cemetery
where Kate's body was found.

502
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:15,020
How long you work at the
Army Corps of Engineers, Jeb ?

503
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,260
Been serving my nation and
the public my whole life.

504
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,600
When you're not getting loaded
at PMI football games,

505
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:20,901
threatening girls ?

506
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,600
"Better lock your door at night.

507
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,810
With 2,500 bloodhounds
and only one bitch,

508
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:27,211
you won't make it to Thanksgiving."

509
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,870
What the hell is all this about ?

510
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,400
Your meter number is the same

511
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:33,301
as your office mailing
machine, Einstein.

512
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,940
No other PMI grads in your department.

513
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,070
Certainly not your son Brandon.

514
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,760
Couldn't get anywhere near the place
with a 2.2 from Roman Catholic.

515
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,770
Brandon was a good kid.

516
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,250
PMI would have straightened him out.

517
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,680
Woulda, coulda, shoulda.

518
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,960
How many DUIs he got now ?

519
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,740
My son was a legacy.

520
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,060
That used to mean something there.

521
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,720
You wanted that girl gone.

522
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,620
Hate mail is state offense, Jeb.

523
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,910
So I wrote one stinking letter.
Big deal.

524
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,440
Why you hassling me over a girl
who dropped out three years ago ?

525
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,890
She popped back up.

526
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,660
Roxborough Cemetery,

527
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:08,461
few blocks from your house.

528
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,680
I want a lawyer.

529
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,870
Why ? Got something to hide ?

530
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,190
Class of '82 had a tailgating party
on campus

531
00:27:15,191 --> 00:27:17,991
same day Kate disappeared,
November 15, 2005.

532
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,320
You were there.

533
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,420
We're gonna give the jury
opportunity and motive.

534
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,790
Look, I didn't hurt that girl,
all right ?

535
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,020
I don't know how she
wound up in that grave.

536
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:29,490
You want to find out,
you talk to her boyfriend.

537
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,700
I'm sure her multicultural boyfriend
knows what happened to her.

538
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,300
Multicultural boyfriend
got a name ?

539
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,320
Don't know.
Not a lot of 'em at PMI,

540
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:49,921
shouldn't be too hard to find out.

541
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,590
What did you do after
the class of '82 tailgate?

542
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,640
Cross burning ?

543
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,290
I went to dinner with the same
group of alumni that I always do.

544
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,560
You can check.

545
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,420
Count on it, Jebediah.

546
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,500
Keith Henderson, only black cadet
in Echo Company.

547
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,480
Kid never spoke to Plumstead
Township Police in '05.

548
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,300
Better have a good excuse

549
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:18,901
for not coming forward
when she went missing.

550
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,330
I'll get his records,
see what I can dig up.

551
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,340
Oh, did you check on
Jeb's alibi ?

552
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,470
Oh, be taking my time getting
to that.

553
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,390
Ever get an award
for penmanship ?

554
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,870
Guessing you think I should have ?

555
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,200
This "P" looks like an "R".

556
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,230
Could have unraveled
your PMI warrant big time.

557
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,530
Came all the way down here
to rail on my cursive ?

558
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,830
Actually, I was wondering what
you were up to Friday night.

559
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,510
I got tickets to
"The Heartless Bastards".

560
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,040
The who ?

561
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,030
Yeah, I wish it were The Who,
but venue's a little small for them.

562
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,800
Are... are you asking me out
on a date ?

563
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,790
So what do you say ?

564
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,240
You... gonna feed me first ?

565
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,770
I can do that.

566
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,870
Then I say yes.

567
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,580
I don't get it,Scotty.

568
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,030
I'm divorcing my husband.
That's not good news?

569
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,250
Maybe if you had told me six months ago.

570
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,390
Look,I don't know what to tell you...

571
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,470
You need time. Yeah, you told me.

572
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,940
All this back and forth,

573
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:24,141
seems like we could both use
a cooling off.

574
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,220
Is that what that was last month ?
Cooling off ?

575
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,490
Will got shot.

576
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:32,160
It was wrong, me coming to you.

577
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,290
So that's it ? Just like that ?

578
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,720
I don't know what you want
from me, Frankie.

579
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,580
For the record, I think
you're making a mistake.

580
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,170
A really bad one.

581
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,520
At ease, soldier.

582
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,780
- Can't leave my post, sir.
- Put down the weapon, Keith.

583
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,500
Making us nervous.

584
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,860
Talk about your relationship
with Kate Butler.

585
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,950
Knob year.

586
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,840
She was in Echo Company with me, ma'am.
That's about it.

587
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,470
See,now you're violating
our honor code.

588
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,170
Got an eyewitness puts
you and her

589
00:30:12,171 --> 00:30:14,671
getting cozy at the
Danboro Grous Coffee Shop.

590
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,700
Have to stay at my post, sir.

591
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,310
Your post can wait.

592
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,040
Maybe your graduation next month, too.

593
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,150
Introduce you to another long
blue line down at the station.

594
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:36,100
They called us the Odd Squad.

595
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,140
Echo had me, the chick,
and a Jew.

596
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,300
No one could figure
out why we were here.

597
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,680
What's that got to do with you
giving Kate the high hard one ?

598
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,690
We weren't sleeping together, sir.

599
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,880
I needed a tutor,
and she needed a friend.

600
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,620
("In Hiding" by Pearl Jam playing)

601
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,360
I... I dunno, Kate.

602
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,230
I,infinite sequences
look like Chinese to me.

603
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,990
I'll take dim sum over
antiderivatives any day.

604
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,580
Oh, my God.

605
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,250
- What ?
- You just smiled.

606
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,870
What are you talking about ?
I smile all the time.

607
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,010
Not since I've known you.

608
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,160
Is your face gonna
fall off or something ?

609
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,790
Nope, still works.

610
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,720
Why you so serious, Kate ?

611
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,720
Why do you think ?

612
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,910
I gotta be a hundred times more
Teflon than the rest of the guys.

613
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,970
Put up a front, just like you.

614
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,510
Front.

615
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,040
I really thought you were that tough.

616
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,830
Well, if I let my guard down,
I'll be dead.

617
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,490
Why you doing this, Kate ?

618
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,170
What's matter,
your father wanted a boy ?

619
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:43,260
I were a boy, he'd be bragging
about me to everyone he knows.

620
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,100
Um... it's just...

621
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,910
we want to get that ring, we gotta
get back to this calculus, right ?

622
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,920
Chinese, you mean.

623
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,240
Kate was good people
once you got to know her.

624
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,100
Touching story,Keith.

625
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,590
- That your signature ?
- Yes, sir.

626
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,680
It's barracks sign-out log
from the day Kate went AWOL.

627
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,880
You signed out at 7:17.
Same time as her.

628
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,110
You came back.
She never did.

629
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,960
There's gotta be a mistake,
ma'am.

630
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,600
I was on tours every weekend
that month.

631
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,890
Tours. That's punishment, right ?
What was that for ?

632
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,970
Don't remember.

633
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,310
Something to do with that demerit you
got for getting caught in the ladies' room ?

634
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,360
November 1, 2005.

635
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,700
Two weeks before she's murdered.

636
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,200
That was a misunderstanding.

637
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,160
Same night Kate shows up in the
infirmary with her hand cut up like sushi.

638
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,400
She get that injury
from you, Keith ?

639
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,980
- What ? No,  / - What the hell were you doing,
skulking 'round that ladies' latrine ?

640
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,050
Right here, Keith.

641
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,880
Anytime.

642
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,950
I did go in that latrine.

643
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,100
'Cause I was trying to help.

644
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,140
<i>"Indifference" by Pearl Jam.</i>

645
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,240
Kate?

646
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,630
Wake up. Wake up.

647
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,440
Keith ?

648
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,160
You're bleeding.

649
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,930
Your hand is... Jeez.

650
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,520
Pressure on it.

651
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,090
Here.

652
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,620
What happened to you ?

653
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,260
Kate, who was it,
did this to you ?

654
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,850
Just get me back to my room.

655
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,340
- Kate...
- Please, Keith.

656
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,900
I knew the cadets hated her.

657
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,720
Just didn't know how much until then.

658
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,660
You ever find out who did it ?

659
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,160
She wouldn't tell me, ma'am.

660
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,870
And I never got a look at his face.

661
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,740
You take her to the infirmary ?

662
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,360
Yes, sir. Couldn't get
the bleeding to stop.

663
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,700
When I went back to get my calculus book,
that's when they caught me in the bathroom.

664
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,900
Reason you had to do tours.

665
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,580
Knew I should have kept my mouth shut.

666
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:00,750
All this time I thought
they just ran her out.

667
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,220
Who did you talk to, Keith ?

668
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,670
I was in the "Odd Squad",too.

669
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,070
I thought they were
gonna come after me next.

670
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,160
There's no incident report
filed with Echo Company.

671
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,350
I didn't go through
the chain of command.

672
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,230
The honor code is only as strong
as the cadets who uphold it.

673
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,320
I went straight to the top.

674
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,810
Commandant Murillo ?

675
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,460
Thanks for coming in, Mr.Murillo.

676
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,740
It's Colonel Murillo.

677
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,840
I think I've earned that.

678
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,600
You can have a seat.

679
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:45,780
You have a problem with Cadet
Butler enrolling at PMI, Colonel ?

680
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,990
What's this all about, Lieutenant ?

681
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,920
I believe the detective
asked you a question.

682
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,160
What I have a problem
with is irrelevant

683
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:55,361
in view of what the courts
have decided now, isn't it ?

684
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,820
It isn't when you allow a
student to be assaulted on campus.

685
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,010
That's a bit presumptuous.
Am I on the stand here ?

686
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,220
You knew Kate was attacked,you should
have stopped it from going further.

687
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,400
I knew no such thing.

688
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,260
We have a cadet who witnsed it.

689
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,720
Told you what he saw.

690
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,620
What Cadet Keith Henderson
told me was hearsay.

691
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,500
I chose to go directly
to the horse's mouth.

692
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,640
Sir,Cadet Butler
reporting as ordered,sir.

693
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,540
At ease.

694
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,790
I want to talk to you about an incident that may
have occurred in the women's latrine last night.

695
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,610
Sir ?

696
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,070
I've been told that there was an
altercation between you and another cadet.

697
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,480
Is that true ?

698
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,570
To my knowledge, sir,
there was no incident.

699
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,940
Cadet Butler, are you aware
of the honor code ?

700
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,940
Yes,sir.

701
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:48,010
"A cadet shall not lie, cheat, or steal,
nor shall he tolerate those who do."

702
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:53,560
Now, did anything occur in
the women's latrine last night ?

703
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,330
Nothing happened, sir.

704
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,100
- Dismissed.
- Sir, yes, sir.

705
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,680
That's it ?

706
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,930
You just let her go ?

707
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,710
What the hell
would you have me do ?

708
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,320
The honor code is the
backbone of the institute.

709
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:18,080
If she said it didn't happen,
it didn't.

710
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,620
She was trying to suck it up,
to fit in with the male cadets.

711
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,430
Well,then she made
her choice, didn't she ?

712
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,890
You were head of the school.

713
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,890
I still am.

714
00:36:27,891 --> 00:36:29,991
That hasn't stopped you
from trying to tell me how to do my job.

715
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,340
Maybe if you did it better.

716
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:37,210
I don't care how many pull-ups
Kate Butler could do.

717
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,830
She was never gonna be one
of the boys.

718
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,500
Her anatomy prevented that.

719
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,760
Plain and simple.

720
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,950
You don't give a rat's ass
what happened to her, do you ?

721
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:47,640
Any help I would have given her directly
would have just made the situation worse.

722
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,760
What do you mean, directly ?

723
00:36:48,761 --> 00:36:50,561
I assigned an upperclassman
to keep an eye on her,

724
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:55,190
the same as I'm sure there was somebody
who looked out for you during your training.

725
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,610
Woman with a badge
intimidate you ?

726
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,840
Who was the upperclassman
you asked to look after Kate ?

727
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,440
A first sergeant, Echo Company.

728
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:09,060
He would order her to his room
every Sunday for shine detail.

729
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,260
Cadet James Addison ?

730
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,050
Put the fox in the henhouse.

731
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,390
Are we through here ?
Lieutenant ?

732
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,500
I choose to spend my Saturday
evenings kicking back with a Cohiba.

733
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:29,280
I apologize if the phallic
implications of that offend you, officer.

734
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,160
It's Detective.

735
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,640
And I've absolutely earned it.

736
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:07,080
A lot of work goes into keeping
everything clean, polished.

737
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,790
How can I help you, Detective ?

738
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,960
Made it sound like you hardly
knew Kate last time we talked.

739
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,280
James Frederick Addison.

740
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,470
Commandant's list every semester.

741
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:21,030
I can see why he chose
you to watch over her.

742
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,800
Shine detail, right ?

743
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,410
Every Sunday when
she came to your room ?

744
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,840
Colonel Murillo told you
about that.

745
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,280
Wondering why you didn't.

746
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,650
Kate was attacked one of those Sundays,
two weeks before she disappeared.

747
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,840
Would have been after
she left your room.

748
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,450
That just a coincidence ?

749
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,190
You're right about
my perfect record.

750
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,900
I never failed at a thing in my life.

751
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,460
Until I met Kate.

752
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,400
You going to take all day
with that ?

753
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,270
Sir, I'll try to speed it up, sir.

754
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,340
Brasso.

755
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,240
Bring some back when you
go home for Thanksgiving.

756
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,530
Thank you,sir.

757
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,590
What's wrong ?

758
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,730
- Sir, nothing's wrong, sir.
- Look,enough with the "sir" sandwiches.

759
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,410
- What happened to your hand ?
- It's fine.

760
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,360
Let me see. Come here.

761
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,120
They stitch this up
at the infirmary ?

762
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,460
It's not a big deal. It's just,
some of the polish got in it...

763
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,290
How'd this happen to you ?

764
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,180
PT, I think. Not really sure.

765
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,090
Three years of PT,I never seen
someone's hand sliced like that.

766
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,720
Two parallel cuts, what's that ?

767
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,930
- It's a saber, isn't it ?
- I couldn't say, Mr.Addison.

768
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,020
Look,why do you think I make you
come to my room every damn Sunday?

769
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,350
So we can talk, so that you
have someone to turn to.

770
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,920
Look at me.

771
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,310
Now's the time, Kate.

772
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,630
I know.

773
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,400
Hello ?

774
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,850
Sir, request permission
to get a towel, sir !

775
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,880
Why do you need a towel,knob?

776
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,180
You ashamed of your nakedness ?

777
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,970
Answer me, knob !

778
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,760
You hiding from the sight of God ?!

779
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,540
Sir, yes, sir !

780
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,350
Who was it ?

781
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,520
Come on, Kate.

782
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,010
It was just racking.

783
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,750
Knobs are always getting
racked in the showers.

784
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,300
That wasn't racking.

785
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,250
That was assault.

786
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,410
Look, no guy would tolerate
what he did to you.

787
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,530
So you tell me who it was
so I can go kick his ass.

788
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,640
I got to fight my own battles.

789
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,690
Then take care of it yourself.

790
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,340
Or leave.

791
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,250
You're the first, Kate.

792
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,950
They're all going to be watching you.

793
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,630
I was supposed to protect her.

794
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,490
All cadets carry a saber ?

795
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,670
Only upperclassmen,

796
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:31,171
select members of the regimental honor
guard ; Operations should have a list.

797
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,610
What'd you think
when she disappeared ?

798
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,070
I wasn't surprised.

799
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:40,690
I thought she just finally
had enough and left.

800
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,530
Detective.

801
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,410
Find the person who hurt her.

802
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,020
<i>"Yellow Ledbetter" par Pearl Jam</i>

803
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:25,830
* Unsealed on a porch a
letter sat *

804
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,930
* Then you said,
I wanna leave it again *

805
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:39,520
* Once I saw her on a beach
of weathered sand *

806
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:45,560
* And on the sand I wanna
leave it again, yeah *

807
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:52,460
* On a weekend, I wanna
wish it all away, yeah *

808
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,320
* And they called and I said
that I want what I said *

809
00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:00,210
* And I called out again *

810
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:05,740
* And the reason Ought
to leave her calm, *

811
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:11,500
I know I said,"I know what
I wear, not a box or a bag"

812
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,640
* Can't you see them ? *

813
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,320
And on the eighth day... God...

814
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,130
God created PMI.

815
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:31,580
* I see them Round
the front way, yeah... *

816
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,220
Come on, Scotty. Pick up.

817
