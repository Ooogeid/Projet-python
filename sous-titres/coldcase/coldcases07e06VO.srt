Let us pray.

00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,640
Glory be to the Father and to
the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

Amen.

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,360
Do you hear that, hijo ?

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,580
That is why we do what we do.

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,720
I already walked the track, Poppa.

15
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,280
Just be careful around
that clubhouse turn.

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,540
They should fire that
new tractor guy, huh ?

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,210
Turn is rockier
than my second marriage.

18
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,540
Just keep him tight
on the inside, Poppa,

19
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:10,041
and then give him his head
and let him run.

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,420
You worry too much, Jose.

Construction crew doing renovations
at the Franklin racetrack

24
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:49,221
here dug up this old horse grave.

25
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,480
Right here, outside the track ?

26
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,400
Horse breaks its leg in a race,

27
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,301
weight's too much for it
to heal right.

28
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,520
They euthanized 'em for
humanitarian reasons.

29
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,250
Lot of dead horses.

30
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,500
Standard procedure
back in the day.

31
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,690
Nothing standard
about these remains.

32
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,800
M.E. says it's small for a femur.

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,540
Adult male, maybe five-two.

34
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,670
Decomposed silks, riding pants,
leather boots.

35
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,050
They shoot jockeys back then, too ?

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,970
It's a money clip,

37
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,171
initialed "S.S."

38
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,530
- Maybe a hundred bucks.
- I.D. ?

39
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,140
Just a couple old business cards.

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,370
Track comp cards for guests and family.

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,490
Ten digits. It's pretty faded.

42
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,160
Could be a bank account,
phone number.

43
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,980
Racing silks, boots,

44
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:44,481
all decked out and rarin' to go.

45
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,830
Someone didn't want this jockey
to make it to the fini l lin

Season 7 Episode 06

00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,180
Transcript VO : www.ydy.com

48
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,130
Dead heat

49
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,210
The money clip belongs to a
jockey named Sonny Sandoval.

50
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,160
M.E.'s checking dental
to confirm I.D.,

51
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:30,461
said the guy had
over 30 healed bone fractures.

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,760
Except these.

53
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,990
Multiple puncture wounds
at the back of the skull.

54
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,540
Got CSU looking into it.

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,050
Well, the son, Jose, tried to file a
missing persons report back in '86.

56
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,280
Didn't fit the criteria.

57
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,130
He was a legal adult,
no sign of foul play,

58
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:46,631
no indication he was in danger.

59
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,270
Last seen Labor Day,
right after he lost

60
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,071
the William Penn Derby Cup.

61
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,820
Sandoval had lifetime earnings
over $3 million,

62
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:55,921
yet his house was about
to be foreclosed on.

63
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,220
Hmm, bank account statements ?

64
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,500
Still digging. His bank got
bought out twice since '86.

65
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,130
Last one went belly
up,taken over by the Feds.

66
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,590
Well, Jose states that his father
might've taken a flyer here and there.

67
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,320
Around all that action, sooner or
later you're gonna shake the baby.

68
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,250
Gambling problem, multiple ex-wives...

69
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,151
Gee, I wonder where the money went.

70
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,510
Coulda been in deep to somebody.
Made sure he paid up.

71
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,680
Dug his own grave.

72
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,600
You know,for a guy who liked
to shoot the works,

73
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:23,601
Sandoval's record's clean,
not even a parking ticket.

74
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,740
Yeah, no official record.

75
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,330
Sonny "Mil Hombres" Sandoval.

76
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:32,831
Mil Hombres...
"strength of a thousand men ?"

77
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,110
He needed it,keep up with the
ladies he was pulling down.

78
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,420
Sonny was a rock star :
women, money, cars.

79
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,030
He got mixed up in any trouble,

80
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,931
PPD gave him a pass just like
Iverson and Barkley.

81
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,340
Come on !

82
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,680
Jockeys ?

83
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,650
Those knee knockers
get the ladies ?

84
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,390
Hmm, still a man on a horse.

85
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,320
Confident, athlete...

86
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:54,521
Winning combo.

87
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,390
I'm saying this town loves a winner.

88
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,620
Somebody shoot me.

89
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,280
I'll beat the bushes with the local
bookies and loan sharks.

90
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,881
See what falls out.

91
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,800
You know, says here it took
Jose 30 days

92
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:08,301
to report his father missing.

93
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,320
He's still a trainer there.

94
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,330
Let's hit the track.

95
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,670
***

96
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,880
At first I thought he
went back to Mexico.

97
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,430
When I couldn't find him

98
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:35,531
I knew something bad had
happened to him.

99
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,670
Just didn't think it happened here.

100
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,740
You know anything
about that grave, Jose ?

101
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,340
No, just there was a barn
back there for the old horses,

102
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,090
but Poppa always got the ones on the
way up, not the ones on the way out.

103
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,800
When's the last time
you saw your old man ?

104
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,040
When he lost the William Penn
Derby in '86.

105
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,541
Really tore him up.

106
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,470
You two close?

107
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,260
Poppa was my hero.

108
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,030
I wanted to be a jockey
just like him...

109
00:05:57,131 --> 00:05:59,831
but I hit a growth spurt
when I was 14.

110
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,970
Only kid in America upset about it.

111
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,120
So close, yet it took you nearly
a month

112
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:05,521
to file a police report.

113
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,830
Look, it wasn't uncommon for Poppa
to take off after a tough loss.

114
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,930
He was always talking
about going back to Mexico.

115
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,680
Figured he just put
himself out to pasture.

116
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,390
Understand Sonny liked
the ponies

117
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:18,491
on and off the track.

118
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,400
It's not worth rehashing.

119
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,250
Let's just say he liked a lot of
things that weren't good for him.

120
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,860
Mil Hombres con Mil Vicios.

121
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,550
Sorry, man, no hablo español.

122
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,970
Born and raised in Philly.

123
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,690
Me, too.

124
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,460
Your dad in big to anyone ?

125
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,090
I wouldn't know.

126
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,580
Poppa kinda told me things
on a need to know basis.

127
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,990
Anyone else have a beef
with your old man ?

128
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
Poppa usually carried the beef.

129
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,940
You know, he had a big heart, but
people liked to take advantage.

130
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,830
People like who ?

131
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,570
Poppa's bug boy.

132
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,230
I told the cops back in the day,

133
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:55,231
gave that guy everything,
did nothing but betray him.

134
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,380
Bug boy ?

135
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:59,081
He's a jockey's apprentice
to your dad ?

136
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,440
Angelo Rivera,

137
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:03,041
turned out to be
a worthless ingrate.

138
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,710
- Had to have the guy arrested.
- Yeah, for what ?

139
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,560
He stole Poppa's money
and jewelry

140
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,061
to feed his drug habit.

141
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,430
Guy was a fiend.

142
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,660
Que en paz descanse.

143
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,510
Sonny was like a father to me.

144
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,300
Cut from the same cloth,

145
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:31,501
two poor kids from Mexico.

146
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,060
Sounds like you learned a lot from him.

147
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,090
The man I am today...
is because of Sonny.

148
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,070
That why you stole
from him, Angelo ?

149
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,230
He had you arrested.
Pressed charges.

150
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,900
Espate. Espate.
You got that wrong.

151
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,840
It wasn't your first time
to the dance.

152
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,500
You got popped twice
on meth charges.

153
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,600
I broke my collarbone riding,

154
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,201
I started taking painkillers.

155
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,830
I have that kinda brain, you know,
that can't shut it off.

156
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,760
Before I knew it I was snorting it,
I was shooting it.

157
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:58,361
I just got lost.

158
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,370
I'll say. One more strike and you
were lookin' at some serious time.

159
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,070
Yeah, but Sonny disappeared.

160
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,571
Case got thrown out.
Lucky for you,

161
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:06,472
he wound up in that hole.

162
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,340
You knew about that horse grave ?

163
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,410
I heard the rumors,
but I never saw it.

164
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,530
Not drawing a very
convincing alibi,Angelo.

165
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,660
I was messed up, man.

166
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,930
Bottomed out, baking
donuts in the Badlands.

167
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,340
You trickin' for drugs ?

168
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,310
Look, the only person I hurt
was myself.

169
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,550
After Sonny disappeared,
I got help.

170
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,290
elelg g ilty.

171
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,980
No. Fed up.

172
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,480
I got clean,

173
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:38,281
and dedicated my life
to helping these kids.

174
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,650
These kids need somebody
to believe in them,

175
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:43,351
like Sonny believed in me.

176
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,080
<i>An unbelievable finish as the
rookie from Esteros, Mexico,</i>

177
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,070
<i>Angelo Rivera gets his first win
riding "Little Hope" to victory.</i>

178
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,000
<i>"Everything's Coming our Way"
by Carlos Santana.</i>

179
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,710
"Can't" he said, huh ?

180
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,130
Born with it !

181
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,820
This kid is the next
Mil Hombres. Huh ?

182
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,730
Te dije, hijastro !

183
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,920
- Si ? You told me.
- ***

184
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,060
Box me in,
grab my horse's bridle ?

185
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,960
That's taking food
off my family's table.

186
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,080
You boxed yourself in, Ric, okay ?

187
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:11,881
Don't blame the kid because
you tied one on last night.

188
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,750
That was a Mil Hombres move.

189
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,850
Even tugged his head.
You taught him that !

190
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,420
Do what you got to do to win.

191
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,210
It's the name of the game.

192
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,430
Maybe I'll take your advice, Sonny.

193
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,810
Do what I gotta do.

194
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,510
Ric Yanko, rival jockey.

195
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:38,211
Always eating Sonny's dust.

196
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,780
Shoulda put that shrimp
on the barbie.

197
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,980
Aussie still around ?

198
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,810
He owns a bar near the track.

199
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,280
- Still riding ?
- Nah, but he had his day.

200
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,690
Ric never got a good horse
until Sonny disappeared.

201
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,520
Then he became the
track's number one rider.

202
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,830
Looked like an S&M joint
back there,

203
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:59,231
all those whips and leather.

204
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,850
Riding crops.

205
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,390
Same thing.

206
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,500
Well, a whip's meant to inflict pain.

207
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,360
A riding crop's to motivate.

208
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,620
You're startin' to scare me, Lil.

209
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:11,821
You don't strike me
as the National Velvet type.

210
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,060
After my dad left
my mom needed a job.

211
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,400
Didn't notice she was juiced.

212
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:21,001
She became a ticket taker.

213
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,820
Your ma worked the track ?

214
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,920
Races were over I'd wait for
her to count out her drawer.

215
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,570
Sit in the stands, do my homework.

216
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,670
It's probably not the best place
to leave a kid alone.

217
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,300
Not all bad.

218
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,350
Got to know some of the old-timers,
the rail birds.

219
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,380
- They all had one thing in common...
- Yeah, compulsive gambling.

220
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,240
Dreamers.

221
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Always hoping tomorrow's
better than today.

222
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,470
Ric Yanko ?

223
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,930
Depends who's asking, mate.

224
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,170
Oh, yeah ?

225
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,860
Well drinks are
on the house, Johnnie.

226
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:08,461
Food you pay for,
like everybody else.

227
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,290
Detectives, mate.

228
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,330
And we ain't here for the cuisine.

229
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,530
- Sonny Sandoval.
- Oh, yeah ?

230
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,300
That bloke finally show up off
his face in Mexico somewhere ?

231
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,440
Found Sonny's remains
in an old horse grave

232
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:21,541
at the back of the track.

233
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,040
No kidding ?

234
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,790
And that concerns me how ?

235
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,710
Your career really took off
once he was gone.

236
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,900
I didn't need to kill Sonny
to beat him.

237
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,070
The old git was falling off
all on his own.

238
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,390
Maybe you were in a hurry.

239
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,540
Well, maybe you should get
your story straight,

240
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,741
'cause Sonny made me a better rider.

241
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,190
Yeah, like when the rookie
whipped you,

242
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:41,491
and Sonny manhandled you
in front of the other jockeys ?

243
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,080
Manhandled me ?

244
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,770
I've broken every bone
in my body twice, mate.

245
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,790
You want a medal ?

246
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,840
1,200-pound horse
shattered my pelvis in '92.

247
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,260
If you've got something to say,
say it.

248
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,890
I hope the horse was okay.

249
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,170
Look here,

250
00:11:59,571 --> 00:12:01,571
there was a lot of money
on the table.

251
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,830
People lost their cool.

252
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,330
But all said and done,
we were still jockeys.

253
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,350
And you wore funny costumes.
So what ?

254
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,320
People have no idea what we endure.

255
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,810
Flipping to make weight.

256
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,140
You know what it's like to weigh
110 pounds ?

257
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,820
Not since fifth grade.

258
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,610
It's a brotherhood, jockeys.

259
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,940
And there was no better friend
a jockey could have...

260
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:26,741
than Sonny Sandoval.

261
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,800
Vamanos, huh ?

262
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,710
So the doc tells me that he
wants to put a pin in my knee.

263
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,810
What do u need that for ?

264
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,970
So I could keep kicking
your dingo ass, Yanko.

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,170
Broke my kneecap so many times,

266
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:44,571
he thought I would be crippled
for life.

267
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,720
Told him... "Go to hell !"

268
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,270
Won over a hundred races
since then,

269
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,160
and can still dance
the Jarabe Tapatio

270
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:55,961
with the best of them, huh ?

271
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,530
I love it.

272
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,190
It's Baxter.

273
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,890
Hide your money.

274
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,500
Send that tab over to my table,
if you will, partner,

275
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:11,901
and just cut him off.

276
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,450
He's got to make weight,
and these beers ain't helping.

277
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,100
I'll take care of the tab, Chris.

278
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,360
And another round for everyone.

279
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,920
You forget who owns you, Sonny.

280
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,690
Don't have a problem
when I'm winning.

281
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,191
But you're not.

282
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,010
So suggest you better turn it around

283
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:29,211
before you have a problem
that can't be fixed.

284
00:13:29,912 --> 00:13:33,712
<i>"Evil Ways" by Santana.</i>

285
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,220
Owners, jockeys :
love-hate relationship.

286
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,290
You got to hand it
to old Sonny, though.

287
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,930
That bloke had a pair.

288
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,200
Why didn't Baxter just fire Sonny
for being such a thorn in his side ?

289
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,680
Couldn't.

290
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,210
Sonny had a three-year contract,
paid him, win or lose.

291
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,910
Sweet deal for Sonny.

292
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,950
Especially since he was in a slump.

293
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,160
Baxter came back that night,
found Sonny at the bar.

294
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,720
Told him he was worth more
dead to him than alive.

295
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,240
Randall Baxter ?

296
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,250
I'm gearing up for
the Melbourne Cup there, fellas.

297
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,450
I ait in no mood for
no interviews today.

298
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,060
Well, get in the mood.

299
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,590
You remember Sonny Sandoval ?

300
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,390
Yeah, I heard about that.
That's a terrible thing.

301
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,460
I understand you buried a few
of your horses back there.

302
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,960
Well, sometimes horses
have to be put down.

303
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,490
How about jockeys ?

304
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,440
Now, hold on here. Why would
I want to get rid of Sonny ?

305
00:14:39,441 --> 00:14:40,441
He was one of my best.

306
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,250
Well, the way we hear it, he was
losing more than he was winning.

307
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,810
Guanteed contract was
costing you major moolah.

308
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,540
Sonny was a champion.
You know, you can't teach that.

309
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,600
He still had the ability
to pull it out

310
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,701
if he just had his head on straight.

311
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,350
Saying it wasn't ?

312
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,600
Well, he started losing focus,
you know ?

313
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:59,901
And his sense of priorities
were whacked out.

314
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,680
- Why is that ?
- Why else ?

315
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,270
He started listening
to a woman.

316
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,170
Should have never hired
that female trainer.

317
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,970
She was bad luck.

318
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,600
Who told you ?

319
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,830
- One of the farmhands did.
- Fine. Here, hold it.

320
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,100
Why did u scratch Firewalker, Baxter ?

321
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,240
'Cause Firewalker can't win.

322
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,060
Th horse would rather die than lose.

323
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,270
Well, then his legs ain't as
strong as his heart anymore.

324
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,010
First time he's been healthy in a year.

325
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,120
Tell you what. He loses,
you keep my money.

326
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,910
No, I can't risk that, Sonny.
It's too big a race.

327
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,490
- We had a plan.
- Well, the plan's changed.

328
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,260
Firewalker's going out to stud.
Hell, we should all be so lucky.

329
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,240
Either Firalker races,or I quit.

330
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,550
You better check your contract,
hombre,

331
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:46,751
'cause you race for me,
or you don't race at all.

332
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,240
Now, you're on Sapphire,
so deal with it.

333
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,910
Sapphire's too young.

334
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,010
You're racing her too much.
You're taking her along too fast.

335
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,160
She's gonna end up with the
same injuries Firewalker got.

336
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,840
When did you become
such an amal lover, Sonny ?

337
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,520
Put that on the list of things
you don't know about me, Randall.

338
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,600
You saddle up on Sapphire,

339
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:13,501
or you sit out the remaining
two years of your contract, unpaid.

00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,400
She made him soft.

350
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,410
It's the last thing a jockey can be.

351
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,920
Sounds like she wasn't
just groong the horses.

352
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,140
Yeah, the last I heard,
she moved in with him.

353
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:52,130
I fired her ass a day too late,
if you ask me.

354
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,130
Located a Kristi Duren.

355
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,710
Trainer in Saratoga.
She's in the city.

356
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,920
On her way down now.

357
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,580
Who sent the goods ?
What have we got ?

358
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,740
You have a message from the Pennsylvania
Treasury Department,

359
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:12,841
and the boss wants to see you.

360
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,880
What ?

361
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,310
Your mama didn't teach you
how to share ?

362
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,520
You rang ?

363
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,340
You get a hit on that number yet ?

364
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:29,230
Sonny had a safe deposit
box at another bank branch.

365
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,460
State escheated it due to inactivity.

366
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:33,461
It's been sitting up in Harrisburg,

367
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,280
at the Pennsylvania Treasury
Department for the last 20 years.

368
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,870
All right, get a subpoena,
send a uniform up there.

369
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,250
Uh,one other thing,Nick.

370
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,380
- I just saw this.
- Oh,yeah.

371
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,240
That joker Sadowsky in Vice

372
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:49,441
took this after I worked
a double last week.

373
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,190
- I was up all night.
- It got e-mailed around the department.

374
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,880
Guy's just breaking my balls.

375
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,750
It made its way up
to the Deputy Commissioner.

376
00:17:55,751 --> 00:17:57,551
He wants you to get a physical.

377
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,510
A physical ?

378
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,640
What's that got to do
th he taking a few winks ?

379
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,070
Pencil pusher wants to send
a message.

380
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,510
You opened the door.

381
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,030
- It's a bunch of bull.
- Just do it, Nick.

382
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,910
Hard business for a woman
to break into back then.

383
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,280
Sonny helped me get
my first training job.

384
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,970
He saw something in you.

385
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,720
The man had a good soul.

386
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,470
Loved horses, loved horse people.

387
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,710
Like you ?

388
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,680
I stayed with him whenever I wasn't
on the road and needed a place to crash.

389
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,450
That come free, or with benefits ?

390
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,170
What happened to Sonny ?

391
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,380
Found his remains in
an old horse grave

392
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:43,981
at the back of the track.

393
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,750
Horse pit.

394
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,140
That what they called it ?

395
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,910
For the horses they put down
at the track ?

396
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,270
That,and the old horses that
got slaughtered for their meat.

397
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,970
Slaughtered ? For meat ?

398
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,520
From stable to table,
in Japan within days.

399
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,510
Racing's dirty little secret.

400
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,160
Well, Sonny know about that
back then ?

401
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,830
Suspected as much.
Horses an investment.

402
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,650
Some owners try to eke
out every last dollar.

403
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,820
I just opened Sonny's
eyes to that reality.

404
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,320
Baxter didn't appreciate it.

405
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,730
Kind of getting the feelg that you
and Sonny were re than just bunkmates.

406
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,510
Fell for the old guy.

407
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,390
Taught me so much
about horses, life.

408
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,410
I knew he needed someone
to take care of him.

409
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,580
Cared so much that you didn't even
come forward 

410
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:31,381
when he disappeared.

411
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,660
Only 'cause Sonny had
already pushed me away.

412
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,650
Where the hell is Jose ?
I called him three times.

413
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,950
Stop worrying. Relax.

414
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,120
You should take that job
in Saratoga, Kristi.

415
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,400
Can't. I'm training you
and Sapphire.

416
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,410
Ah,Sapphire's had trainers.

417
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,760
But you break that maiden there
with its bloodline,

418
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,461
you got a career.

419
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,430
I want to be with you.

420
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,970
Ten years ago, I'd give you
a run for your money,

421
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:05,371
but this ride is slowing down
to a light trot.

422
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,700
You're the best jockey
I've ever seen, Sonny.

423
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,260
What has it gotten me, hmm ?

424
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,350
Doesn't matter how much money,
how many races I win.

425
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,630
I'm still just a monkey
to Baxter's organ grinder.

426
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,900
That's not true.

427
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,990
Then why am I not riding
Firewalker in my last race, hmm ?

428
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,110
I'm 45 years old, and I can
barely climb out of the tub.

429
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,910
- Take the job, Kristi.
- I'm here, Pop.

430
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,610
Don't look back.

431
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,390
Next day, I was out
as Sapphire's trainer.

432
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,540
Packed my stuff, went to Saratoga.

433
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:57,441
Been there ever since.

434
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,810
What were Sonny and Jose
fighting about ?

435
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,230
They always spoke in Spanish when
they didn't want me to understand.

436
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,770
In Spanish ?

437
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,300
Had to guess,it was probably
about Jose's money problems.

438
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,710
Oh, like father like son.

439
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,670
The gambling problems run
in the family ?

440
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,400
No,just Jose.

441
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,930
Sonny had a lot of vices,but
gambli wasn't one of them.

442
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,060
CSU says these puncture wounds
at the back of Sonny's skull

443
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:25,861
are equally spaced,

444
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,620
likely caused by some sharp instrument.

445
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,390
Well, could be a rake. Pitchfork ?
Something from the stables.

446
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,600
Bunch of cashed checks made out
to Jose from Sonny's bank count.

447
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,010
Sonny didn't have a gambling
problem. Jose did.

448
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,660
So, why did he lie about that ?

449
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,970
Or speaking Spanish ?

450
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,050
And what else does Jose
got to hide ?

451
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,000
Perdon,u ? hora es ?

452
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,300
Son veinte despues de las...

453
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,501
Hola, Jose.

454
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,000
Sure sounded like Spanish to me.

455
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,110
What, you ashamed
of being Mexican, boss ?

456
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,760
My mother came to this country
and cleaned people's homes.

457
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,240
Wanted me to assimilate.
Speak English.

458
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,430
Still no reason to lie about it.

459
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,670
Every time I speak Spanish,
it reminds me of Poppa.

460
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,220
It hurts too much.

461
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,860
Kinda like his gambling problem.

462
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,980
- There's no need to dredge that up.
- Because it wasn't his problem.

463
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,380
It was yours.

464
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,120
Pop got tired of digging you out.
Cut you off.

465
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,850
It took you a month to file
a police report.

466
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,451
Waiting for that trail to go cold.

467
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,600
- No, it wasn't like that.
- What was it like, Jose ?

468
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,350
I'm starting to lose
track of all your lies.

469
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,460
LookI had a problem, okay ?

470
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,060
And I caused my Pop a lot of pain.

471
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,170
But he made damn sure I paid him back.

472
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,090
- With what ?
- My back.

473
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,140
He needed a new trainer
for Sapphire.

474
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,870
And I needed to prove
myself.

475
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,260
Les go, Sapphire.

476
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,740
Okay, cool her down.

477
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,760
She's a little washy.

478
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,870
Anxious.

479
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,140
That's because she's been red
too much.

480
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:05,841
She's probably getting
shin splints already.

481
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,410
Listen, Poppa.

482
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,380
I'm done this time, for real.

483
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,970
No short cuts, Jose.

484
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,050
A man has to have a purpose...
a calling.

485
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,840
It's a gift to have un
don con los caballos.

486
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,330
Special bond with the horses.

487
00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:25,831
Si. And you have it.

488
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,890
The horse knows who to trust.

489
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,670
Who to fear.
Who to layed all down for.

490
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,770
Like Firewalker.

491
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,430
When I first saw him run...

492
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:42,431
this old dust track
in New Mexico...

493
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,200
just a two-year-old,
small for his age...

494
00:23:44,201 --> 00:23:47,101
not the fastest,
not the strongest horse.

495
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,910
38-to-1 odds.

496
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,970
- Won by three lengths.
- It's unbelievable.

497
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,270
Taken that horse from last to
first more times than I can remember.

498
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,580
A scrapper. Warrior.

499
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,400
Leaves it all on the track.

500
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,120
Why isn't he racing
in the derby then ?

501
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:06,690
Ah,people don't care about what you
did,they only care about what you're doing.

502
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,380
You'll win with Sapphire,
though, right ?

503
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,130
Sapphire hasn't lost a race yet.

504
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,420
If she loses it's my fault.

505
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,910
Lagate, sinverguenza ! Lagate !

506
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,590
Andale ! Lagate ! Lagate !

507
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,790
No te metas en lo que no te importa !

508
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,120
Lagate ! Lagate ! Vete !

509
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,620
It only took him 20 years to
tell me I was good at something.

510
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,220
It was like we just turned a corner,
and then he was gone.

511
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,150
So, who was the guy in the truck,
spooking the horses ?

512
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,750
Juan Diaz.

513
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,860
He worked out of the back barn.

514
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,920
Seeing if we were selling
any old horses.

515
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,300
Sold off to market for the meat ?

516
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,580
People turned a blind eye to
what happened to the old horses.

517
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,980
Poppa said he couldn't do it anymore.

518
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,400
Had Diaz banned from the track.

519
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,190
Well,that back barn was near
where the horse grave was?

520
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,260
Untill it burned down.

521
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,390
I don't know if Diaz dug
that grave,

522
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:15,591
but he had to know it was there.

523
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,950
We'll be in touch, Jose.

524
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,240
Hot date ?

525
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,745
Eh, something I gotta check on.

526
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,000
I'll meet you back at the roundhouse ?

527
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,000
Mijo !

528
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:40,020
What's wrong ? Shoes didn't fit ?

529
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,495
Don't think I can return them.

530
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,845
Ah, no, no.

531
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,490
Look, Ma tell you she hurt
her knee ?

532
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,565
Maybe.

533
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,275
You know your mother.
She talks a lot.

534
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,850
Some I hear, some not so much.

535
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,955
This have anything to do with her
taking cash from our bank account ?

536
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,220
Just try to remember, Pop.

537
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,844
Oh, I was watching the Phillies game,
the one that ended in the triple play.

538
00:26:02,015 --> 00:26:04,985
- Kid on second base, unassisted...
- Bruntlett, yeah, beat the Mets.

539
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,135
What happened with Ma ?

540
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,664
She went to Dayley's market late

541
00:26:08,665 --> 00:26:11,565
to pick up some seafood and rice
to make me some paella.

542
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,110
- She slipped and fell.
- And that's it ?

543
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,385
Yeah, she came home,
took a shower and went to bed.

544
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,740
What about the paella ?

545
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,904
She said she was tired.
I had a frozen dinner instead.

546
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,195
That's Dayley's at 19th
and Fairmount ?

547
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,035
No, the one on Spring Garden.

548
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,840
Your mom says they have
better produce there.

549
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,839
Everything okay ?

550
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,718
Yeah, yeah, Pop, everhing's fine.

551
00:26:36,143 --> 00:26:37,220
Okay.

552
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:41,240
Estas flaco.

553
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,970
Banana bread.

554
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,095
Put nuts in it this year.

555
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,845
Never misses an anniversary.

556
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:52,970
The mother.

557
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:54,605
Wanda Johnson.

558
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,970
Left for school, never came home.

559
00:26:58,611 --> 00:27:00,046
How long has it been ?

560
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:01,208
16 years.

561
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,746
Won't let go.

562
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,195
You call her back yet ?

563
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,594
Just break her heart all over again.

564
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,211
No new leads.

565
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:12,143
No sense to be made of it.

566
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,157
When you get ready to
make the call, use my office.

567
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,940
Yeah.

568
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,435
How the hell did you
end up in Willmsport ?

569
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,285
Car's got GPS, Wayne.

570
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,205
Well, turn on the lights and lead-foot it to
Harrisburg before the Tresury closes at 6:00.

571
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,647
I need that box !

572
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:33,485
Knucklehead's gotta
be related to somebody.

573
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,910
Looks like the Meat Man
got his ticket punched.

574
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:39,120
Juan Diaz, deported by INS.

575
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,005
Yeah, impounded his truck
back in '99.

576
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,815
Found a track parking pass,
butcher tools and a stunbo gun.

577
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,780
- Put a horse down fast.
- Or a jockey for good.

578
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,355
We even know if he's alive ?

579
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,505
Just that Diaz got
deported to Esteros,Mexico.

580
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,785
And Angelo Rivera is from Esteros.

581
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,518
2,100.

582
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,426
Sonny's bug boy comes from
the same small town as Diaz.

583
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,195
Ends up working the same place,

584
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:03,196
4,000 miles away.

585
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,065
Angelo worked for the Meat Man.

586
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,870
Knew damn well were
that grave was.

587
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,692
Okay, you guys go brush the horses.

588
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,528
Taco de caballo.

589
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,745
Ever make carne asada
from horse meat, Angelo ?

590
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,027
Back in Esteros ?

591
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,375
That some kind of sick joke ?

592
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,089
Sick all right, but no joke.

593
00:28:28,214 --> 00:28:29,749
You working with Juan Diaz ?

594
00:28:30,162 --> 00:28:31,575
Know a lot of Juan Diazes.

595
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,860
Talking about the one from your hometown,
knucklehead. The Meat Man.

596
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,240
Diaz offered me a way out  Esteros.

597
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,638
I needed a job, willing to do anything.

598
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:45,973
Killing horses ?

599
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,601
I never killed a horse.

600
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,355
Just buried what was left.

601
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,935
You know, it made me sick,
but it was part of the business.

602
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,820
That all you buried ? Horses ?

603
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,725
Come on,guys.

604
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,613
Look,l I ever wanted to be was a jockey.

605
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,448
I owe my career to Sonny.

606
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,375
And your life to Juan Diaz.

607
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,225
Soy had him banned from the track.
Lost his livelihood.

608
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,075
Guy who gave you your start.

609
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,465
You dug that grave.

610
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:12,466
Put Sonny's body
where it'd never be found.

611
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:15,631
No. Juan got me here...

612
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:17,832
but Sonny gave me my dream.

613
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,541
And I threw it all away.

614
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,844
Heard about what happened
to Firewalker.

615
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,790
Sorry.

616
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:43,781
It was no accident.

617
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:46,785
I'm not gonna let Baxter
get away with it this time.

618
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,655
Be careful, Sonny. Don't want
to see you get blackballed.

619
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,831
End of the line for me, mi amigo.

620
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,585
My last race was gonna
ride Firewalker out.

621
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,450
Son of a bitch Baxter has
taken that away from me.

622
00:29:58,575 --> 00:30:00,131
Firewalker deserved better.

623
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,110
Killing horses for money has to end.

624
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,886
We all get thrown away
when we can't win anymore.

625
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:09,025
Unless you keep winning.

626
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,349
Slow down, k.

627
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,265
- You're gonna end up like me.
- One hell of a jockey ?

628
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,522
Broke. Whizzing blood. Lucky
to have one kidney working.

629
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,354
110 pounds. Getting
on a thousand-pounds animal

630
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,055
going 45 miles an hour.

631
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,140
And you're not even straight.

632
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,413
Like you always taught me,

633
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:31,414
do whatever I have to do to win.

634
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,055
I was wrong.

635
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,725
I'm worried about you, Angelo.

636
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,335
I'll be fine. Never felt better.

637
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,330
Is that why you stole from me ?

638
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,259
I was gonna pay you back.

639
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,170
You want to pay me back ?

640
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,600
Take care of yourself.

641
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,395
Sonny was right.

642
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,921
Horses, jocks, were all disposable.

643
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,644
One day you're on top of the heap
and the next,

644
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:09,045
done for good.

645
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,305
Firewalker...
sold off to Juan Diaz ?

646
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,775
No. Stable fire.

647
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,655
But everybody knew it
was an insurance job.

648
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,145
- How sick was Sonny ?
- Pretty bad.

649
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,050
But a macho guy like that
never went to a doctor.

650
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,505
Where was he getting
all the pain pills ?

651
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,051
Track vets will hook you up
for the right price.

652
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,961
But for him, it wasn't enough
anymore.

653
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:34,610
Neither is your alibi, Angelo.
You're coming in with us.

654
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,884
I understand your champion horse,
Firewalker,

655
00:32:02,385 --> 00:32:05,585
died in a stable fire in '86 ?

656
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,875
Casualty of the business.

657
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,087
You know, we can put a man on the moon,
but we still make barns out of wood.

658
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,505
You were investigated
for insurance fraud in '94.

659
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,745
Stallion named Bloodline.

660
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:23,874
Lost three champion horses over
a 13-ye period to barn fires.

661
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,645
That's a lot of accidents.

662
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,861
Well,it happens to
the best of us,partner.

663
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,645
But I'm gonna tell ya'll just like
I told them insurance investigators.

664
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,745
Why in the hell would I wanna kill a horse
that I paid nearly a million dollars for ?

665
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,060
That's exactly what we
were asking ourselves.

666
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,865
Until we saw this.

667
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,675
This insurance clam

668
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,055
Made two million dollars when
Firewalker went up in smoke.

669
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,195
And another mil and
a half for Bloodline.

670
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,124
Well, that right there is just peanuts
in comparison to

671
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:56,225
what I spend each year
on stud fee.

672
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,018
Guess they outlive their use,
like Firewalker.

673
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,320
You really know how to squeeze
a dollar out of a horse.

674
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,155
Dead or alive.

675
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,245
Well, I'm going to take
that as a compliment.

676
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:11,825
That is, unless y'all know something
those insurance investigators don't.

677
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,654
Oh,we know Sonny was going to
rat you out after that big race.

678
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,035
Couldn't afford that kind of attention.

679
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,185
Open up another arson investigation.

680
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,490
So, you put him in a hole.

681
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,800
I didn't kill that old cuss.

682
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,870
But I should've.

683
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,216
Thank y'all for coming.

684
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:40,800
<i>"Jin Go Lo Ba" by Santana.</i>

685
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,810
This is why they call
this the Sport of Kings.

686
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,880
Listen at 'em. They can't
wait to see those beasts run.

687
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,150
It's going to be a good one, sir.

688
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,600
This goes well, you're going to
be training many of my ponies.

689
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,490
Thank you, Mr.Baxter.

690
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,780
<i>They're off and running !</i>

691
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,960

692
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,020

695
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,370
<i>First turn,Sapphire holds his lead,</i>

696
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:16,771
<i>but Little Hope, ridden by Angelo Rivera,
makes his move on the outside.</i>

697
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,270
Come on, Poppa !

698
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,310
<i>They enter the back sttctc,
Sapphire by a head,</i>

699
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:22,811
<i>Little Hope running a close second.</i>

700
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,980
Going to break her out of the pack.

701
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,770
No, not yet !

702
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,240
<i>They turn for home, Sapphire breaks open,
runnin' and gunnin' now, ahead a length,</i>

703
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,610
<i>a length and a half.</i>

704
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,170
That's it ! Poppa !

705
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,510
<i>Letting out all stops
in the final stretch,</i>

706
00:34:37,511 --> 00:34:39,911
<i>as Sapphire kisses the sky
and says good-bye.</i>

707
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:42,850
<i>Wait !</i>

708
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,650
<i>Little Hope pulls within a length
of Sapphire.</i>

709
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,320
What the hell's he doing ?!

710
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,060
<i>Little Hope suddenly moves into
the lead, as Sapphire begins to fade.</i>

711
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,240
<i>Little Hope is ahead by a nose,
a length.</i>

712
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,000
<i>She's gonna pull off the upset.</i>

713
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,180
<i>Little Hope wins !</i>

714
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,730
Son of a bitch pulled up on him
on purpose !

715
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,250
- Mr.Baxter...
- Shut up, get the hell outta here !

716
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,740
I'm gonna have that taco bender
and your whole family deported !

717
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:18,880
You know, that was the first
of three heart attacks.

718
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,250
I spent a month in
recovery at Mercy Hospital.

719
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,980
Sonny choked on purpose.

720
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,530
Over a stupid horse.

721
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,650
Sapphire should've won
that race, sure thing.

722
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,410
Even his son bet ten
large ones on him to win.

723
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,770
So, why'd Sonny do it ?

724
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,010
Crackpot, I think he wanted to take
Firewalker back to Mexico with him.

725
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,310
Till you killed Firewalker
for the money.

726
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,390
Insurance investigators said

727
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:47,191
in all three reports
that faulty wiring caused those fires.

728
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,160
It's quite a coincidence.

729
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,920
So, another horse dies in the fire.

730
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,550
Why don't we just call it
a return my investment ?

731
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:02,360
I beat that thing just like
I did in 1994 with Bloodline.

732
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,570
Statute of limitations Detectives.

733
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,810
Is that right ?

734
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:10,240
How's your heart holding up,
Randall ?

735
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,050
You beat it in '94

736
00:36:12,051 --> 00:36:14,151
'cause seven years
had passed in that investigation.

737
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:16,580
Seven years from
when the investigation begins,

738
00:36:16,581 --> 00:36:18,281
not when the crime was committed.

739
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,530
Yeah, which in the case of
Firewalker was...

740
00:36:20,631 --> 00:36:21,631
an hour ago.

741
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,730
When we called
your insurance company

742
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:26,231
and decided to investigate.

743
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,510
Stand up, Baxter.

744
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,150
You're under arrest for insurance fraud.

745
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,380
From the Treasury Department,
I come bearing gifts.

746
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,370
Sonny's safe deposit box.

747
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,630
Inside,

748
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:49,731
a receipt for a plot,

749
00:36:50,332 --> 00:36:52,332
life insurance policy...

750
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,210
and a copy of his last physical.

751
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,870
Blood in his urine...

752
00:37:00,271 --> 00:37:02,571
years of boulimia and pills...

753
00:37:02,572 --> 00:37:03,972
that guy was a mess.

754
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,320
Getting his affairs in order.

755
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,130
And look who he left all to.

756
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,540
Standard bow rake.

757
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,750
One-inch width beetween each tooth.

758
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:19,750
Same exact width between puncture
wounds to the back of Sonny's skull.

759
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,640
Somebody brained your old man, Jose.

760
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,080
A terrible way to go out.

761
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,560
Ever cross your mind your gaming
might've cost your dad his life ?

762
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,870
I told you, I cleaned up before that.

763
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,860
Told us a lot of things, Jose.

764
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,500
Truth is you bet large
on your dad,

765
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,101
and it cost you big.

766
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,700
The job with Baxter
and a lot of coin.

767
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,620
Old man had to go, so you took
him out with a rake like this.

768
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,720
Stable rake.

769
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,450
Anyone at the track had access to that.

770
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,720
- Like Angelo ?
- What I told you from the start.

771
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,250
Angelo, who won that last
race against your dad ?

772
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,250
Yeah. So ?

773
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,290
Angelo, who was like a son to him.

774
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,220
Cut from the same
poor streets of Mexico.

775
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,160
Un verdadero Mexicano.

776
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,480
Wished he was his son.
Angelo was a real man.

777
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,810
A jockey.

778
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,770
You... Americanized.

779
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:09,560
Too big to be a jockey.
A gambler. Liar.

780
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,270
You did nothing but cost him.

781
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,200
At least I wasn't a scumbag
drug addict.

782
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,600
Found Sonny's life insurance policy.

783
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,650
Life insance ? My old man ?

784
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,220
Oh, yeah.

785
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,080
Guess who he left everything to ?

786
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,630
And I'd be worried if my son
was a compulsive gambler.

787
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,480
Why waste the money ?

788
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,750
It makes perfect sense
who he left his money to..

789
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,670
- Yeah.
- Who ? Kristi ? Angelo ?

790
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,120
Firewalker ?
They all came before me.

791
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,410
He paid off your debts.

792
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,440
To save himself from embarrassment.

793
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,090
The great Sonny Sandoval
couldn't have a loser for a son.

794
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,970
If he'd just won that last race,
you'd have been rollin'.

795
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,600
Damn right.

796
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,280
But no, he had to pull up.

797
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,520
Just to make a point.

798
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,680
Yeah, that he never cared about me.

799
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,530
You're wrong, Jose.

800
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,250
The weight loss, injuries, pills...

801
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:07,151
it take its toll.

802
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,840
Sonny's inteal organs
were shutting down.

803
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,030
Your pop was making plans to
take care of those he left behind.

804
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,380
My father was dying ?

805
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:22,250
yeah Still managed to make
that last payment,though.

806
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,540
And you were sole beneficiary.

807
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,440
Left you $3 million.

808
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,580
Even after all you put him through...

809
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,480
...he still loved you,Jose.

810
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,070
I don't understand.

811
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,820
Why couldn't he just tell me ?

812
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,250
You happy now ?

813
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,840
I'm free, mijo.

814
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,350
I borrowed ten G's.

815
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,070
What?

816
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,690
You promised me, Jose.
You gave me your word.

817
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,830
I bet itll on you... to win.

818
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,100
Mijo, why ?

819
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,780
When was the last time
you bet on me, Poppa ?

820
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,360
Son ?

821
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,370
- You're sick, okay, u need help.
- Then help me !

822
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,850
- I tried.
- You tried ?

823
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,000
By tanking the race
so that Angelo could win ?!

824
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,190
I'm your son ! Not Angelo !

825
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,250
I-I couldn't win another race
for Baxter

826
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:31,751
after what he did to Firewalker.

827
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,480
But I'm the one that pays.

828
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,670
Poppa, it cost me money
and a job !

829
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,960
I have failed you.

830
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,400
I did not want this life for you.

831
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:45,300
Wanted you to be better than me.

832
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,050
I made so many mistakes.

833
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,120
It's time everyone knows
the truth, okay ?

834
00:40:51,121 --> 00:40:53,021
These horses deserve better
and so do jockeys.

835
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,190
What are you talking about ?

836
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,130
Poppa,f you do that,they blackball
me.I'll never be hired as a trainer again!

837
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,450
No, you'll get help. It'll be okay.

838
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:00,551
- Trust me.
- No, no, Poppa.

839
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,800
Dot worry. I will take care
of everything, mijo. You'll see.

840
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,240
I'm so sick... I'm so sick
and tired of waing for you !
