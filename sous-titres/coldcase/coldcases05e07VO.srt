00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,600
Oct. 30, 1938

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,900
 Please don't hurt me.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,200
   How did you get in here?

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,000
  No!

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,100
-  Ow 
- Oh, oh.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,300
Frankenstein,
are you all right?!

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,500
It's not funny, Mom!

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,800
I can't see.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,700
 The mask takes away

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,200
- my "perfil" vision.
- Oh.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,700
I'll cut the eyeholes bigger.

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,800
Don't worry, Dobber.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,800
You'll have the best costume
tomorrow.

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,300
   Pops!

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,100
   Hi, Pop.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,100
   I'm gonna be Frankenstein
for Halloween.

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,500
   That's swell,
  champ.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,500
Hello, dear.

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,500
   Looking beautiful this evening.
   Supper ready?

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,600
   20 more minutes.

21
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,100
 How was work?

22
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,000
  'Nother great day.

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,800
 <i>The Edgar Bergen Show!</i>

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
 We're missing it.

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,100
Well, go put it on.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Thanks, pet.

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,800
   we interrupt our program
of dance music

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,000
to bring you special bulletin

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
  from Intercontinental Radio
 News.

31
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,200
   At 20 minutes before 8:00
 Central Time,

32
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,700
  Professor Ferrell of the Mount Jenngservat

33
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,800
  Chicago, Illinois,

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,700
   reports observing
  several explosions

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,100
  of incandescent gas

36
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,800
occurring at regular intervals
 on the planet Mars...

37
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,700
...Something's happening...ni out of the pit.

38
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,500
The mouth is... kind of V-shaped
 with saliva.

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,100
Those quivered pulsating monster

40
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,400
   or whatever it is
   can hardly move.

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,800
   The thing's rising up now
   and the crowd falls back.

42
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,200
 Lord, they're turning
  into flame!

43
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,200
 He's followed by the woods...

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,600
- Mom.
- Shh. it's all right.

45
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,100
  ...the vast pigs...

46
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,000
  At least 40 people,
 including six state troopers,

47
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,200
  lie dead in a field east...

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,800
Ladies and gentlemen, I have
 a grave announcement to make.

49
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,900
  Incredible as it may seem,
 both the observations

50
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,200
  of science and the evidence
of our eyes...

51
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,500
  ...lead to the inescapable
  assumption

52
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,100
   that those strange beings
  who landed

53
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,900
in the Jersey farmland tonight

54
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,700
are the vanguard of an invading army 
from the planet Mars...

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Hello?

56
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,600
Yes.

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,500
Oh, my God.
All right.

58
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,700
 Felton, what is it?

59
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,200
That was Mrs. Brown next door.

60
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,000
 The Martians
 are only a mile away.

61
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,800
We have to go.

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,200
But...

63
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,500
  Dobber, get your coat.

64
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,300
Where are the car keys?

65
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,300
In your pocket.

66
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,900
 We need to pack
up our bags.

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,500
 Where's Loki?

68
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,800
  We can't leave Loki behind!

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
  The dog'll be fine.

70
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,100
- I'll get him.
- But, Audrey...

71
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
   He's just
in the backyard.

72
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,300
   I will be right back.

73
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Get Dobber's things,
Felton.

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,700
  I'll be right back.

75
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,600
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it.

76
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,700
"Martians Take
Audrey Metz?"

77
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Thank you, sir.

78
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,100
Can you at least
   tell us if the police

79
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,800
will be issuing a statement?

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
Those yoyos
   are up early.

81
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,600
 We find Hoffa
  in this hole, boss?

82
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,400
Not quite.

83
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
Deceased female.

84
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,700
  Broken hyoid bone.

85
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,900
   Strangled.

86
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,100
  ME says the remains
 have been down there

87
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,500
for at least 50 years.

88
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,200
 An old well.

89
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,400
   Clever dump site.

90
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,000
Coins in her purse

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,100
are all dated

92
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,300
  from the '30s.

93
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Hmm.

94
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,400
A-W-M.

95
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,500
 Her initials?

96
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,400
I ran them against

97
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,900
all the missing persons records

98
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,800
from the '30s.

99
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,800
 You two believe in Martians?

100
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,800
Is this that woman that
   disappeared in the '30s?

101
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,600
Audrey W. Metz.

102
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,000
 It was the end of the world.

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
   My grandmother was eight.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
Said she had nightmares
   for over a year.

105
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,300
  What the hell you guys
  talking about?

106
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,800
   October 30, 1938, Scotty.

107
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,000
 Orson Welles
 did a radio broadcast

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,800
   of <i>The War of the Worlds.</i>

109
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
 Only he made it seem
  like it was a news report.

110
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
People believed it.

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Millions thought
the Martians were invading.

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,900
Mass panic
across the country.

113
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,100
And Audrey Metz
disappeared that night.

114
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,400
And the legend began.

115
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,500
 A lot of crazy rumors
   of what happened

116
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,200
   like, uh,
 Martians really did take her.

117
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,500
Or the Germans.

118
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,200
There were Audrey Metz
sightings

119
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,300
for the next 20 years.

120
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,900
 Like someone saw her
   scuba diving in Jamaica.

121
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,600
Or working as a spy in Berlin.

122
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,800
 People got way too much
time on their hands.

123
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,500
 Everyone thought Audrey
 traveled far and wide.

124
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,100
But She never made it out of Philly.

   I still can't
 believe it.

129
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,300
   Martians?

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,900
 Didn't anybody know
   this was a prank?

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,100
The power of radio
in those days, Nick.

132
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,200
Was the only live
news source.

133
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,700
  Back when the news wasn't all

134
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,400
  about the latest starlet's
  drunk driving bust.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 "My wife and I heard it
come over the car radio.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
"All we could think of
 was to get back home

137
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
  to see our children
   before the final attack."

138
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,400
  Well, churches around the country held

139
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,700
  "end of the world"
   prayer meetings.

140
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
One guy heard the news
post-shower,

141
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,900
drove all night
   from New York to Florida

142
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,100
in a towel to see his fiancee.

143
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,400
 Suddenly, everything precious
 in life became crystal-clear.

144
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,300
 Yeah.

145
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,400
  Who do you want to be with

146
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
when the world ends?

147
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,900
I wanna be with the guy
that knows it's a hoax.

148
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,900
  Audrey was
a 33-year-old housewife

149
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,200
  with a husband, Felton

150
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,300
   and an eight year
   old son, Robert.

151
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,900
   Family was packing to go.

152
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,200
   She went out back to get their dog, 
never returned.

153
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,600
  Cops had no leads.

154
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,400
 It was like she just vanished
into thin air.

155
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,000
 Torn movie ticket found
  in Audrey's purse.

156
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,900
Country's panicking,
 Audrey hits the movies?

157
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,600
Maybe the usher did it.

158
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,400
 There's handwriting
on the back.

159
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
A-Y-S.

160
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
More initials?

161
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,200
   Or second half of a word.

162
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,000
Maybe part of an address
she wrote down?

163
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,700
 Nick, you and Miller
  check St. Luke's Hospital.

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,900
Elmer Gibbins, witness from back in the day, 
keeps calling,

165
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,300
   says he knows
 who did it.

166
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,500
  Elmer the same guy
   that saw her in Germany?

167
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,000
Got to start
  someplace.

168
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,200
Meanwhile, let's meet with any
 of the family still in town.

169
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,500
  When I was little,

170
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,800
  I liked to think all those
rumors about my mom were true.

171
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,600
 Living on an exotic
   island somewhere.

172
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,700
   She used to read
   adventure stories to me.

173
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,200
I always hoped
she was off on one of her own.

174
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,300
Anyway, that's
what I had to believe.

175
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,300
 You notice anything different
  about her behavior

176
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,600
before she disappeared?

177
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,300
My mom was very happy.

178
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Week before
she vanished.

179
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,500
  That a Hudson,
   Mr. Metz?

180
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,400
 Yep.

181
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
  1930 model.

182
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,300
 Saw one of those at
 a classic car show

183
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,600
few years back.

184
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
  Guy was asking
40 grand for it.

185
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,800
Think ours cost $600.

186
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,600
Lot of money in the Depression.

187
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,100
   Especially with your dad
 out of work for three years.

188
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,700
 Put a strain on
 their marriage?

189
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,800
  Of course.

190
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,700
  But they loved each other.

191
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,500
  Well, sometimes that's

192
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
not enough.

193
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,400
 Maybe she chose
that night to split.

194
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,900
My mom would never abandon me.

195
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,700
 Dad, why were we always
 so mad at the Indians?

196
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,800
Weren't they
 here first?

197
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,400
Aud, have you seen my glasses?

198
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,100
Come on, Dobber.
No strange questions

199
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,800
- at the table.
- Put the book away, Sitting Bull.

200
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,000
   It's time to eat.

201
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,500
 Soup again?

202
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,000
Stop complaining, son.

203
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,300
But it doesn't
make me full, Dad.

204
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,000
  I get tummyaches at night.

205
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,900
Have my bread, sweetie.

206
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
   Work picking up?

207
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
   Any day now.

208
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,600
 Well, in the meantime

209
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,700
 we have bills to pay.

210
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,300
Winter's coming.

211
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,300
- We can't afford the gas.
- Dobber,

212
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,600
fetch me some water.

213
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,700
  What the hell do you think
 you're doing?

214
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,500
We do not discuss

215
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,100
these things
in front of Dobber.

216
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,400
  When will we discuss them?

217
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
   We're in trouble, Felton.

218
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Things will pick up.

219
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:13,900
You can't

220
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,500
 keep putting on
 a suit and tie

221
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,900
 and going to an
   empty office.

222
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,000
It's my job.

223
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,800
We're down to pennies, Felton.

224
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,800
   Maybe

225
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,400
it's time you found other work.

226
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
  The WPA...

227
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,000
The WPA will have me
digging ditches.

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 If it means putting food in
 Dobber's stomach, so be it.

229
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
For the love of God, Felton,

230
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,000
the boy's wasting away.

231
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,800
   I will not become
 a pampered poverty rat.

232
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,900
What will
the neighbors think?

233
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,700
  Who cares what they think?

234
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,900
   This is your son.

235
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,100
I have a reputation.

236
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,000
 You think the neighbors
 care about reputations?

237
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,000
  Like Ralph Bodine,

238
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,100
who put a bullet in his head
  when the stock market crashed?

239
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
  How about Ruth Cayler?

240
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,900
 I saw her selling apples...

241
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,600
Pass the salt, please.

242
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,300
 Sounds like

243
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,700
   the marriage
   was strained.

244
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
  It was just the Depression
   talking.

245
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,000
Their fights
  ever escalate?

246
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,900
 I was with my dad that night.

247
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,300
We drove around looking
for Mom until sunrise.

248
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,100
   I understand your dad
   lives here with you.

249
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes.

250
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,800
He's not well.

251
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,600
 Alzheimer's.

252
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,400
 Any way we could talk to him?

253
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,100
You're welcome to try.

254
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,300
  Hello, Aud.

255
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,600
   Have you seen my glasses?

256
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
 Mr. Metz...

257
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,500
You look

258
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,100
beautiful this morning.

259
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,100
I'm... I'm Detective
 Lilly Rush,

260
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,700
 and this is my partner,
  Scotty Valens.

261
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,500
  We'd like
  to talk to you

262
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,100
about the night
your wife disappeared.

263
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,100
What time's supper?

264
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,300
 Uh...

265
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,400
   Mr. Metz,

266
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,600
   do you remember the, uh,

267
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
  <i>War of the Worlds</i> broadcast?

268
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,900
  The Martians on the radio.

269
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,100
 Yeah, the Martians.
  Remember that?

270
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,400
  October 30.

271
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,700
Dobber was going to be
 Frankenstein that Halloween.

272
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,900
 That's right.

273
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,600
We searched
all night for Audrey.

274
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,200
Then I got the news...

275
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This just in: we can now confirm

276
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
the Martian landing was a hoax,
 a radio show.

277
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,500
The governor has issued
 a statement; it's all a hoax.

278
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,200
   We really thought
 it was the end of the world.

279
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,100
 Orson Welles,
what a son of a bitch.

280
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,300
  Hello, Aud.

281
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,400
   Have you seen my glasses?

282
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,100
Elmer Gibbins.

283
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
   Just had hip replacement
   surgery.

284
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,900
 Claims he saw Audrey
   back in the day.

285
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,400
Doing what?
Scuba diving?

286
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,300
  Well, well.

287
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,300
   How you doing, neighbor?

288
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,200
  Hey, Toni.

289
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,500
   You remember Kat Miller.

290
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,500
   Hi.

291
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,900
  Nice to see you again.

292
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,900
  I'll be down the hall.

293
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,000
 Sure.

294
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,300
  Uh, interviewing a witness.

295
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
Right.

296
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,900
Don't let me keep you.

297
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,700
 No, no.

298
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,500
 I, uh, I got a sec.

299
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,900
   How you been?

300
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,600
  Good.

301
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,000
  Don't see you much
 around the building.

302
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,500
Busy.

303
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 People keep killing
   each other, so...

304
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,200
  You?

305
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,000
   Same.

306
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,700
   People keep getting sick.

307
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,300
 Never changes.

308
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,700
Nothing ever does.

309
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,100
 Well... it's good to see you,
 Nick.

310
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
   You too.

311
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,200
  Take care of yourself.

312
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,000
 Yeah.

313
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,100
 I can't believe you
   finally found Audrey.

314
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,500
You knew her well?

315
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Yes, ma'am, saw her once a week
 at the 6th Street breadline.

316
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,200
Real nice lady.

317
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,100
Tell ya, I always thought they'd
 be too clever to get caught.

318
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,400
  "They"?

319
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,900
  The FBI, dipstick.

320
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,100
Don't you get it?

321
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,700
  Audrey knew
   the invasion was coming.

322
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,000
  The store should've opened
 an hour ago.

323
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,700
All we got's time, Audrey.

324
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
Waiting is as close
as I got to a purpose.

325
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,700
  I got to get home.
Dobber's sick.

326
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,700
   Again?

327
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,800
Is he getting
 any meat or fruit?

328
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
 Only when he dreams about it.

329
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The best part of my day
   used to be waking him up.

330
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,200
   I swear, he used to sleep
 with a smile.

331
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,400
He'd always have a joke
   or a funny dream

332
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,000
to tell me about when he woke.

333
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,700
 Now...

334
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,600
  I like to let him sleep in.

335
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,000
  Good afternoon, ma'am.

336
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,100
   If I may be so bold--

337
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,900
   you're too beautiful
   for this much sorrow.

338
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,900
 I...

339
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
  Thank you.

340
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,900
 Come to 5th
and Diamond.

341
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
   Yours will be
 the prettiest taxi.

342
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,300
  I don't understand.

343
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,700
 Rest assured,
   I only pick a chosen few.

344
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
   Good day.

345
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,400
"Prettiest taxi"?

346
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,800
Any idea what that meant?

347
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,000
 Some kind of government code.

348
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,500
 FBI.

349
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,200
This man said

350
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,500
  he was with the FBI?

351
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,100
Of course
he didn't say it.

352
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,700
  He was an undercover agent,
 not a moron.

353
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,200
   Is this guy new?

354
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,300
Total rookie.

355
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,600
   Figures.

356
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,600
   You see,
  Audrey was picked special.

357
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,400
 The FBI knew
that the Martians were coming,

358
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,700
  but the Martians got to her
 before she could run.

359
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,800
Then, the FBI covered it over.

360
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,500
 Right.

361
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,100
   Is the boss punishing
   us for something?

362
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,100
Told you not to steal
his paper clips.

363
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,400
   Miss her?

364
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,100
  Don't even think about it.

365
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
  Expect me to believe that,
   dipstick?

366
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,500
 <i>Oh, here's a good one.</i>

367
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,300
Lady said, "I saw Audrey jogging
with Hitler in Fairmount Park."

368
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,700
   Let me guess, she's alive
and wants to make a statement.

369
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,100
Called ten minutes ago.

370
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,900
How about a dance boss?

371
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,500
 Ten cents gets you one song.

372
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,900
Oh, this better be good.

373
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,200
That guy told Audrey to meet him
at 5th and Diamond, right?

374
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,300
 Used to be where the
 Palomar Ballroom was in 1938.

375
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,800
   Palomar Ballroom?
What's that?

376
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,800
   Dance hall.

377
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,100
Lot of young women worked there
   as taxi dancers.

378
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,800
I talked to the guy who runs it now, 
real history buff.

379
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,700
That's not a movie ticket.
It's a dance ticket.

380
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,300
For a dime-a-dance girl.

381
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,100
- Mm-hmm.
- That's right. Men would pay for dances

382
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,000
would last the amount you paid--
   like a taxi ride.

383
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,700
 Yeah.
G-rated version of a lap dance.

384
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,100
  Guy who managed it
 was named Buzz Moran.

385
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,800
   He died in 1972.

386
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,900
 So this Buzz
was recruiting Audrey.

387
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,600
 And that ticket says
   she took the job.

388
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Opens a whole new world
 of suspects.

389
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,100
Yeah.

390
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,900
My money says her killer was a client.

391
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,200
 The Palomar Ballroom.

392
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,200
  My, oh, my, that feels
   like a hundred years ago.

393
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,200
How did you find me?

394
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,400
The Palomar has photos
from your day.

395
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,500
You're the only one
we found, Penny.

396
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,200
   You mean,
 I'm the only one still alive.

397
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,100
Oh, I'll be
gosh-darned.

398
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,700
 Now, who can imagine
   being that young?

399
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,000
We're investigating the murder
of Audrey Metz.

400
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,700
We think she was a dancer there.

401
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,800
Audrey...

402
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
I read about it in the papers.

403
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
   You knew her at the club?

404
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,200
   Oh, you betcha, by golly.

405
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,100
   We got to be very close.

406
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,800
She don't seem to fit
the profile of a dancer.

407
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,900
Oh, true.

408
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Most of us were
  working-class girls

409
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,100
  who wanted to dance
professionally

410
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,700
 or be in the movies.

411
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,900
Not many moms?

412
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,100
 Oh, gosh, no.

413
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,500
I heard stories
about the Palomar in those days.

414
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,100
Cops were called in to break up
   a lot of fights.

415
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,000
  It could be a rough and humble place.

416
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,800
 It attracted
   a lot of dangerous types.

417
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,300
How did Audrey handle it?

418
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,800
Different class of gal.

419
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,200
  Had trouble
   with the tough customers.

420
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,200
Have a pleasant evening.

421
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,100
  You must be Audrey.

422
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,000
  I'm Penny.

423
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,500
Oh, you're gonna love it here.

424
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,200
   Oh, well, this is
 just temporary.

425
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,100
 Till my family gets
   back on its feet.

426
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,700
  Do we just stand and wait?

427
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,900
You don't wait.

428
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,800
You advertise.

429
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,500
What if they touch you
  where they're not invited?

430
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,800
Oh, don't worry.

431
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,700
  Most of these guys
are Okay Joes.

432
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,700
It's how I met my fiancee Crick.

433
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,500
   There he is now.

434
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,000
 The thing is,
 times ain't that bad.

435
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,700
 There's good
  if you know where to look.

436
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,600
 You think so?

437
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,400
 You betcha, by golly!

438
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,000
 Now the band's gonna play
  a slow one for you.

439
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,300
   This is called "Always."

440
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,900
How ya doing, toots?

441
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,500
 Ticket doesn't pay for that,
sailor.

442
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,500
Yeah. What does?

443
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,800
 How about two sawbucks,
   you polish my golf shaft?

444
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,800
Go to hell.

445
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,100
Hey, relax.

446
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,200
Let me buy you
some giggle water.

447
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,500
  Warm you up a bit.

448
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,600
Why don't you take a rest, pal.

449
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,000
 The lady seems tired.

450
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,800
  Why don't you mind
   your beeswax.

451
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,500
  You drunk, stupid or both?

452
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,700
You wanna talk outside, buster?

453
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,900
  Sorry, my mistake.

454
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,500
 Thank you.

455
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,700
The owner, Buzz, gave a talking
to that sailor.

456
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,500
He shipped out

457
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,800
the next day anyway.

458
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,000
  So who was
 this knight in shining armor?

459
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,600
  Will Paige.

460
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,000
 He'd sit in the dark
 and stare at Audrey,

461
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
night after night.

462
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,300
He was this

463
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,800
   lonesome rich guy
 with nothing to lose, and...

464
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,200
he gave me the heebie-jeebies.

465
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,900
 You thinking
Will might've hurt her?

466
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,400
He was awful violent.

467
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,800
Rumor was,
he quit the booze

468
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,900
'cause he got in a drunken fight
 and he killed a guy.

469
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,700
 Mr. Paige?

470
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,000
   Detective Rush and Vera.

471
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,000
  We're investigating the murder

472
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,700
of Audrey Metz.

473
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,000
  I checked your record.

474
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,900
 Three drunk

475
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,000
- and disorderlys back then.
- You sent a man

476
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,600
to the hospital with your fists,
  almost killed him.

477
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,200
   Glad I stopped drinking.

478
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,100
Got a witness says

479
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,800
 you were stalking her
   at the Palomar Ballroom.

480
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
  Rich man with too much
  time on his hands?

481
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
  How'd you make out so well
during the Depression?

482
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,500
  I was an inventor.

483
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,300
   Already retired.

484
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
   Sounds like you were just
another guy out to buy

485
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,500
a piece of tail.

486
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,800
You get rough with her?

487
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,200
 Audrey wasn't
 like the other girls.

488
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,700
Every night I bought up
   all her tickets.

489
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,200
   That's a lot of dancing.

490
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,000
 Oh, we never danced.

491
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,800
  My wife is
desperately ill.

492
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,100
   Hospitalized.

493
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,500
 I found a strength
 I never knew I had.

494
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,200
  I did everything I
  could to help her.

495
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,800
And then one day...

496
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,500
 You lost her?

497
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
   Yeah, I lost her.

498
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,800
   It's like life is
 just about survival.

499
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,000
Like, love has...

500
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,400
 fled forever.

501
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,100
 You can't even see it
   in people's eyes anymore.

502
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,400
You mean you and your husband?

503
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,600
I truly loved him once, but...

504
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,200
  ...since things got so bad,

505
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,600
   I don't know him anymore.

506
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,700
- You think he's changed?
- No.

507
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,300
  What I fear is this
   is who he's always been.

508
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,800
Or you're the one who's changed.

509
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,500
 Maybe I have.

510
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,800
I know I'd do anything
  to protect my son.

511
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,500
 Maybe I've found the strength
   that I never knew I had.

512
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,700
You were awful tough
   with that sailor.

513
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,200
 I was afraid.

514
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,300
 You were brave.

515
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,200
I was thinking, "There's
  someone who can hold her own."

516
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,200
 I was also thinking
 how big he was,

517
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,000
   hoping you'd take
 the first shot.

518
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,400
I forgot about that.

519
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,600
What?

520
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,000
  Laughing.

521
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,900
Maybe one night we should dance.

522
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,400
Maybe.

523
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,400
  I should...
  get back out on the floor.

524
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Audrey?

525
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,700
   You're a damned disgrace.

526
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,200
 Sounds like her husband
   was a little jealous.

527
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,900
   He never saw me.

528
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,200
Besides, there was nothing
to be jealous about.

529
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,400
  I was still in love
 with a ghost.

530
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,900
  Felton didn't know
  about her dancing?

531
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,600
Middle class housewife
  becoming a taxi dancer...?

532
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,800
  Scandalous.

533
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,700
Tough for an ego

534
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,300
- like that to take.
- I suppose.

535
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,700
I never saw her again.

536
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,500
   Maybe murder was
the only way to get her

537
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,300
 to hang up her dancing shoes.

538
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,600
This is absurd. I told you

539
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
   I was with my dad
   the whole night.

540
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,200
Your mom was a taxi dancer.

541
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,000
 He found out.

542
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,500
   You knew.

543
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,100
Might've mentioned that to us.

544
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,700
   Hasn't there been
  enough speculation

545
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,400
and rumor about my mom?

546
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,400
Can't you let her rest in peace?

547
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,200
   We just want to find out
what happened.

548
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,800
  What happened is my mom was
  trying to feed our family.

549
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,000
She sacrificed
  everything for me.

550
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,100
  Yeah, but your dad

551
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,700
couldn't handle
what she was doing.

552
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,800
  No.

553
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,600
They came to an understanding.

554
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,100
I told you, Audrey.

555
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,800
You will not go back
to that place.

556
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,600
What do we have to show
   for these past two weeks?

557
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,300
   We don't have food to put
 on the table again!

558
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,500
At least I can walk

559
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,900
down the street
without people thinking

560
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,100
that my wife is a...

561
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,700
People can think what they want.

562
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,100
I applied for a shipping job

563
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,400
 at the Piper factory.

564
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,300
   They said
  I wasn't qualified enough.

565
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,400
   My God, I've got a degree
from Dartmouth.

566
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,100
Then we don't have a choice.

567
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,800
 Then I have to go back.

568
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,700
It'll be our secret.

569
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,700
  You needn't be ashamed
  of me, Felton.

570
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,000
Do you remember
   when Dobber turned four?

571
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,800
That blizzard we got caught in?

572
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,200
I had to push the car
out of the snowbank.

573
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,500
  You called me your "hero."

574
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,300
  You still are.

575
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,900
   Tell your ma
   Penny's here.

576
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Tell her the good's gone, kid.

577
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,600
- Penny?
- Yeah.

578
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,800
My mom had to take her
   to the hospital.

579
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,900
 She had bruises
on her neck?

580
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,600
 Like she was choked.

581
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,300
 Same way Audrey died.

582
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,500
 <i>You married</i>

583
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,100
Crick in 1939.

584
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,600
  Yes, we had 15
  wonderful years...

585
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,200
 Well, then, 
the cancer got him.

586
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,000
 You were Crick's second wife.

587
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,700
In the divorce records,
his first wife

588
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,700
said he was physically abusive.

589
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,500
 Well, that's not my business.

590
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,000
Penny, we talked
to Dobber,

591
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,200
  said you showed up
at their house.

592
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,500
 Said you had bruises
 on your neck.

593
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
 I wanted to believe
   people were good.

594
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,400
  But I was wrong.

595
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,200
   What do you mean?

596
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,600
 Crick wanted me
 to sell myself.

597
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,700
- I said "no," and...
- He beat you?

598
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,000
Maybe he did the same to Audrey.

599
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
If anyone is to blame...

600
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,000
it's me.

601
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,200
 You?

602
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,300
I went to Audrey

603
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,400
for help; 
I was so upset that night, I just...

604
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,100
  What is it, Penny?

605
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,100
  I was jealous of her and Will.

606
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,000
I had to prove to Audrey

607
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,100
  that the world
was a bad place.

608
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
What'd you do?

609
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,600
  I told her
   Will Paige's real secret.

610
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,100
You sure you're
feeling better?

611
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,300
   You betcha, by golly.

612
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,000
Hello.

613
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,300
   Hi, Will.

614
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,100
Look, Buzz says I have to take
   other tickets. I can't...

615
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,300
Just give me a minute.

616
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,600
I need to talk.

617
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,700
Where were you?
I was worried.

618
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:52,100
 I'm fine. I can
take care of myself.

619
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,900
I bought a special ticket tonight.

620
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,800
   The song that was playing
   when I first saw you.

621
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,300
   It's how long
  this ticket lasts.

622
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,800
"Always."

623
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,800
   Before I met you,
  I thought anything

624
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,000
   good in my world
   was gone forever.

625
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,900
  I started believing people
  that said life was just cruel.

626
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,700
 And then I met you.

627
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,700
  Love hasn't gone anywhere.

628
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,400
 It's right here in front of us.

629
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,700
 The cruel thing

630
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,200
  would be to ignore it.

631
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,500
Will, I can't leave my son.

632
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,100
   He's all I have.

633
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,900
 I'll help take
 care of Dobber.

634
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,300
  Whatever it takes.

635
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,700
I can't.

636
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,000
Because of your husband?

637
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,300
Because of your wife.

638
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,200
I know she's alive, Will.

639
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,800
You're still married.

640
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,200
I thought you were the kind
of man who faced the truth.

641
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,500
At least my husband doesn't lie.

642
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,200
You're the cruelest of them all.

643
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Audrey!

644
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,800
 Shot of rye, Mickey.

645
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,800
Mr. Paige,
you never drink.

646
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,100
 To hell with never.

647
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,800
   To hell with her.

648
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,300
 Are you sure the word
  "always" was on the ticket?

649
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,300
Oh, yes.

650
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,300
   Positive.

651
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,700
Same ticket that ended up
with Audrey's body.

652
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,700
  Will saw her again.

653
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,300
seems that you've got a selective memory, Will...

654
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,100
<i>You saw Audrey again.</i>

655
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Only this time
 she was on to all your lies.

656
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,500
Telling people
your wife was dead?

657
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,600
- That's cold.
- Don't you people understand?

658
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,100
She might as
 well have been.

659
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,500
   She was institutionalized
   for three years.

660
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,100
   Back then they called it
"mood swings."

661
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,500
   She was bipolar?

662
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,000
What difference is the name?

663
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,500
 The stigma of mental illness
in those days was worse than TB.

664
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,100
 She never got better?

665
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,300
 There was a terrific
   new treatment...

666
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,100
  called a lobotomy.

667
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,400
Left her good as dead.

668
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,200
  Both of us.

669
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,600
I sat in the dark
for three years.

670
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,400
  And then Audrey walked in.

671
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,800
That was real romantic, homes.

672
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
   One problem.

673
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,100
You were still married.

674
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,300
 Audrey left you in the dust.

675
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,800
 Maybe you killed her
 to keep her.

676
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,200
   She wasn't mine to keep.

677
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,600
- But you found her that night.
- No.

678
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,900
 She found me.

679
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,700
I Thought I lost
her forever.

680
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,200
  No feeling worse than that.

681
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,200
   But things change

682
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,500
when it's the end of the world.

683
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,500
How so?

684
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,500
   It was as if nothing else
   existed but her.

685
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,800
...in Washington, DC,

686
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,500
  early reports tell us that
 over 300 are dead or missing

687
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,600
in the Capitol.

688
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,300
   This adds
to the widespread devastation...

689
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,400
  Is that ticket still good?

690
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,000
...we have already encountered

691
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,800
   from the horrible
Martian attack.

692
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,200
  Thousands are fleeing west
  from the frightful invaders

693
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,500
from space with nothing but fire
and destruction in their wake.

694
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,900
  This announcer cannot help

695
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,800
but wonder if these are the end
times our Bible has prophesied.

696
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,400
It does say "Always."

697
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,900
Leave with me, Audrey.
It's not too late.

698
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,700
  Will, you know
I can't.

699
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,600
What are we going to do?

700
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,400
   Just hold me.

701
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,400
   Hold me one time
   before it's over.

702
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,900
We had that one dance,
  and then she left.

703
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,100
I drove around the rest
of the night in a daze.

704
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,100
And the Martians
never came.

705
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,800
I didn't have a radio in my car.

706
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,700
   I didn't even know it
was a hoax till morning.

707
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,300
But you had that dance.

708
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,600
 If I had let
that moment slip away,

709
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,600
 I couldn't have lived
 with myself.

710
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,700
Toni Halstead?

711
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,000
She's a nurse. Toni... Halstead?
she's ...

712
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,100
Dr. Bruce, telephone, please.

713
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,000
 Toni?

714
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,900
  Toni! Toni?

715
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,100
Ah, Toni.

716
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
- Hey.
 - Me?

717
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,600
- Hi.
- What's wrong?

718
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,900
Nothing's wrong.

719
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,600
  I'm on a case. 
Guy thought it was the end of the world,

720
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,400
  had to see the girl
 he was in love with,

721
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,700
and they danced to their song,
and it made me think

722
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,000
about that Sinatra song that was
  playing on our first date.

723
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,400
- Sinatra?
- I don't care

724
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,500
 that you hate my job,

725
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,800
 or you think
we're no good together.

726
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,600
I don't want
to lose you.

727
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,500
   I can't live without you.

728
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,900
Sinatra wasn't playing
  on our first date.

729
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,100
What?

730
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,500
  Tupac was.

731
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,800
Tupac?

732
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,600
  Sinatra was playing
   at the restaurant

733
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
  on our third date.

734
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,100
  Point is...

735
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,200
 I didn't want to wait

736
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,700
until the end of the world

737
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,200
   to do this.

738
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,900
   Hold it!

739
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,800
   You think
  you can just waltz in here

740
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,400
 like some crazy-assed
Jerry Maguire,

741
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,600
   and we're back together?

742
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,400
Just like that?

743
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,900
 I was kind of hoping.

744
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,800
 Don't say it.

745
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,100
Think about it.

746
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
   I'll be waiting.

747
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,800
   I'll be waiting!

748
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,700
 <i>I was talking to this,</i>

749
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,100
   uh, guy.

750
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,700
   Had a car just like that.

751
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,700
  Said he didn't get the news

752
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,900
   about the hoax 'cause
   he was driving all night.

753
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,300
- So?
- Well, cars didn't have radios till 1932.

754
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,800
That Hudson
didn't have one.

755
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,400
That's a 1930 model.

756
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
You came over
to talk about cars?

757
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,200
  Your father heard the news
about the hoax when he was home.

758
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,700
You really look

759
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,400
   for your mother till sunrise?

760
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,700
    She came home

761
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,400
that night, didn't she?

762
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,100
 I...

763
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,800
   I had to believe
  the world was a good place.

764
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,300
You saw her?

765
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,900
No, but I heard her come home.

766
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,200
   I was...

767
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,500
 I was in bed, falling asleep.

768
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,000
The next morning,

769
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,500
  I convinced myself
 it was just a dream.

770
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,200
After a while,
  I started to believe that.

771
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,400
   Better than the reality.

772
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,900
I swear

773
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,800
  I don't know what happened.

774
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,600
 My dad could never...

775
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,200
He's...

776
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,200
  He's just a sick...

777
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,600
  old... man.

778
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,300
Thank you, Aud.

779
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,000
 What time is supper?

780
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,700
   About 20 minutes.

781
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,700
Felton?

782
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,900
 Yes.

783
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,800
I can't believe
  it was all a hoax.

784
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,300
 Is Dobber all right?

785
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
   Dobber's in bed.

786
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,900
Where were you?

787
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,300
  Answer me. Damn it!

788
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,000
I was at the ballroom.

789
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,500
I was with him.

790
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,700
I finally had something
 to believe in

791
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,400
   at the end of the world.

792
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,200
  What did you have, Felton?

793
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,800
Nothing.

794
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,800
Is everything okay?

795
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,200
Where's Dobber?

796
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,200
I looked everywhere
for the dog,

797
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,300
and I had to help Miss Curran
start her car, and...

798
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,800
  It was a hoax.

799
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,300
What?

800
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,700
  The invasion--
   it was a lie.

801
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,700
   Just like the one
 you're telling.

802
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,000
   You went to see someone.

803
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,400
 Yes.

804
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,100
   I had to.

805
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,300
What did that place do to you?

806
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,700
  It made me strong.

807
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,400
I... met someone...

808
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,800
...who made me realize

809
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,400
 that I'm still alive.

810
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,900
  What about us?

811
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,600
 Our marriage died years ago,
Felton.

812
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,100
   Aren't you tired
  of playing pretend?

813
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,200
I just want the girl
   that I fell in love with.

814
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,300
   That person doesn't exist
   anymore.

815
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,100
  Why should you have someone
   to go to?

816
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,800
   Felton...

817
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,600
Everyone was
 afraid tonight.

818
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,500
Do you know what
  scared me the most

819
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,800
 at the end?

820
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,300
I had no one to turn to.

821
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,100
 My world was empty.

822
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,600
Go to bed, Felton. You're tired.

823
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,700
  Don't you tell
  me what to do!

824
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,900
   Now fix me my supper.

825
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,600
   Fix it yourself.

826
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,800
  Audrey... you will
  do as you're told.

827
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,500
- Felton, please.
- You're my wife.

828
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,000
   You love me, damn it!

829
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,900
  I'm your hero!

830
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,900
  <i>I'm your hero!</i>

831
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,700
 In case you missed it, folks,
 there's no Martians.

832
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,200
The only danger
was in our imagination.

833
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,900
  Now let's all relax
   with some romantic music.

834
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,900
   Here's "Always."

835
