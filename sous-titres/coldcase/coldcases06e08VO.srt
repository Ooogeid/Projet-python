FATHER... ?

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,300
IT'S TIME.

11
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,900
DON'T LOOK BACK.

12
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,900
- Where is she?
- Isn't she coming back for an encore?

13
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,500
EXCUSE ME...

14
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,800

Oh...

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,800
Eh...

18
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,700
I'm sorry. Um...

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,800
For my family, please.

20
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,100
We ask for your kind help.

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,800
MAY I HELP YOU, SIR?

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,700
YOU SPEAK RUSSIAN?

23
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,100
Well, only a little.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,900
MY GRANDPA TAUGHT ME.

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,100
You a Russky too, Vera?

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,600
Go get 'em, rook.

27
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,500
THANK GOD...

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
.. I DON'T KNOW IF OUR CHAPERONES FOLLOWED US...

29
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,600
... WHAT IS THE PROTOCOL?

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,300
Whoa, sir.
I ain't fluent.

31
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,700
I got curses and toasts,
that's all.

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,900
Papa, please.

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,500
We surrender our passports.

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,500
we want to defect
to United States.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,500
<i>The United States.</i>

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,500
You speak English... big time.

37
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,300
I learned by watching American
television on the black market.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,300
Don't tell my father.

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,500
You, uh, coming
from the prom?

40
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,800
Uh...

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
a concert.

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,900
This dress belonged
to my mother.

43
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,700
NADIA, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,100
We'll, uh, call
the State Department

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,800
and get someone down here
to meet you.

46
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,500
Discuss political asylum.

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,200
You know, if you do this,
there's no going back.

48
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,700
Yeah.

49
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,600
Welcome to the United States,
little man.

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,900
I am sorry.
He only knows police

51
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,300
in Russia, where
they can't be trusted.

52
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,300
Things are different here.

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,900
You call me, any time.

54
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
I'll help you out.

55
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,500
And, uh, for your, uh,
collection.

56
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,600
Philadelphia.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,400

KOSLOV, N. DEC '89

59
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,900
I haven't responded
to a fight on the highway

60
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,400
since I was in uniform.

61
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,000
Call came in from the district,

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,800
someone asking for me
by name.

63
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,300
I'll turn that face
into scrap metal!

64
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,500
I'll kill you first!

65
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
Your kind of crowd, Nick.

66
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,000
Who's the guy?

67
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,800
Do I know you?

68
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,500
Yeah, you said
I could call anytime.

69
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,500
I'm Dimitri.

70
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,600
Yeah, Koslov.
I remember.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What's going on?

72
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,500
This scum has my sister's bag.

73
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,700
This bag ain't even mine, man!

74
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,200
So where'd you get it,
tough guy?

75
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Cousin Beamer.

76
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,400
Just denied parole.

77
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,100
His mama's giving
away his stuff.

78
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Son of a bitch.

79
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,300
Know whose it is?

80
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,200
Nadia Koslov.

81
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
Who's she?

82
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,500
I was in the Ninth District
the night the family defected.

83
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Four months later,
I was at her funeral.

NadiKoslov,
17 years old.

88
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,900
Skull fracture, severe
bruising, manner of death

89
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,200
undetermined.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,500
Multiple blunt-force trauma
with cardiac arrest,

91
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,200
consistent with other
wilding victims that night.

92
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,100
Serious crime wave
in the subways, fall of '89.

93
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,300
Packs of kids surrounding
their victims, commuters mostly.

94
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,400
I'm 22 years old; I just aced
my firearms training;

95
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,400
and my ma's begging me not
to take the Broad Street line.

96
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,100
Well, your mom wasn't wrong.

97
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
The assailants
got her bag,

98
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,700
but they left her
jean jacket, sneakers AND HER EMPTY CASSETTE TAPE.

99
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,500
She made some kind of mix tape
THE DAY she died.

100
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,300
She was gonna be
a big opera star,

101
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,500
but she loved pop culture.

102
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,400
Toughest funeral
I ever went to.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,100
I promised the Koslovs that
things would be different here,

104
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,300
but they were worse.

105
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,100
The cousin of the punk
we picked up in Center City.

106
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,500
Arrested on agg assault charges

107
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,800
three months
after Nadia's murder.

108
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,200
Known ties with the crew

109
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,700
who was out wilding
the night Nadia died.

110
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Lab found residue on her bag.

111
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,000
This clown's DNA shows up,

112
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,300
<i>we got a slam-dunk.</i>

113
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,000
What was it about Nadia Koslov's
bag caught your eye?

114
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,000
You like the patches,

115
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,100
the places your sorry ass
will never see, huh, Beamer?

116
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,800
I ain't Beamer no more.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I found my Lord
and Savior.

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,600
I go by Michael now.

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Tell me what happened
that night,

120
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll start using
your grownup name.

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,500
It wasn't me who killed her,
man.

122
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
No? Then how'd you get her bag?

123
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,600
When I found her,
she was already half-dead.

124
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,700
* I got a letter
from the government *

125
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,900
* The other day,
I opened and read it *

126
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,600
* It said they were suckers *

127
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,900
PHONE
* They wanted me for their army
or whatever *

128
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,600
* Picture givin' a damn,
I said never *

129
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
* Here is a land
that never gave a damn *

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,900
* About a brother
like me and myself *

131
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,200
* Because they never did... *

132
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,400
Oh, man.

133
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,100
Zo...

134
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Zo...

135
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,600
Say what?

136
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,100
Zol... toi...

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,300
* ...that I'm a black man *

138
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,300
* And I could never be
a veteran *

139
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,300
* On the strength,
the situation's unreal *

140
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,300
* I got a raw deal *

141
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,100
* So I'm looking
for the steel *

142
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,800
* I'm goin' for that steel... *

143
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,900
Seeing that girl die like that,

144
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,800
all alone...

145
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,000
messed me up real good, man.

146
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,300
Nothing else
to do but pray.

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
What's that you heard her say?

148
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,100
"Zula Toy."

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Is that Russian
or something?

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't know.

151
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
But it's stuck in my head
to this day.

152
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,100
You see anyone else
in the subway?

153
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,500
I only heard
the girl falling

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,200
and footsteps.

155
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,100
What kind of footsteps?

156
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,300
The running kind.

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,100
A bunch of Air Jordans up
the stairs two at a time?

158
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,900
Up the stairs,

159
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,600
but they was like
clickety-clack,

160
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,700
know what
I'm sayin'?

161
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,800
Hard-soled shoes?

162
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,700
Yeah.

163
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,600
How many?

164
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,400
One person, that's all.

165
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,800
You're saying
it wasn't a wilding thing?

166
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,200
As God is my witness.

167
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,600
And I ain't got
no reason to lie.

168
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,300
Clickety-clack.

169
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,200
"Zula Toy"?

170
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,300
Come on, Yakov Smirnoff.

171
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,800
Tell me you know
what it means.

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,700
No clue. Like I told you,
curses and toasts.

173
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,700
But I know someone who might.

174
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,300
You say you cannot convict man
who killed my daughter.

175
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,000
Now you say you can?

176
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,700
What I'm saying, Leo,
is that we've got a new lead:

177
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,600
Nadia's dying words.

178
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,000
"Zula Toy."

179
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,900
That mean anything to you?

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I have no idea
why Nadia say this.

181
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,800
<i>Sounds like zolotoi.</i>

182
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,800
It means "gold,"
"golden one."

183
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,100
Come on, Pop.
They're trying to help.

184
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,400
They cannot bring back Nadia.

185
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
We have witness
testimony.

186
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,000
Whoever killed Nadia
didn't steal anything.

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,400
<i>So why? Drian who kill her?</i>

188
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,700
She knows this person?

189
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,200
What do you remember
about the night Nadia died?

190
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,700
Pop was driving his
usual night shift.

191
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
I was upstairs
with the babysitter.

192
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,700
Anyone come to mind,
had a problem with Nadia?

193
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Of course.

194
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,100
<i>You have been to durdom?</i>

195
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,600
The insane asylum--

196
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,900
that's what he called
her high school.

197
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,900
Regis High School
of the Performing Arts.

198
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,000
Nadia was a voice major.

199
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,900
I thought it was
a good school.

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,200
Pop hated the place.

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,400
A lot different
than the conservatory

202
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,700
back in St. Petersburg.

203
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,100
At Regis there is
no study.

204
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,400
Only craziness.

205
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,600
You say it is someone
she knows.

206
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,700
It is someone there.

207
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,700
My tax dollars paying

208
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,500
for this circus?

209
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,200
Can hardly hear
myself think.

210
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,900
My high school,
we were lucky

211
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,800
to get a field trip
to the dump.

212
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,300
Hey, hey.

213
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,300
Hey.

214
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,100
Clickety-clack.

215
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,200
Detectives?

216
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,100
I'm Elliot Glick.

217
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,600
Right this way.

218
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,200
Bear with me.

219
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,300
Office hours
will start in a few.

220
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,500
Cute haircut, Jules.

221
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,700
Back at you, Elliot.

222
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,100
Nadia's death was a tragedy.

223
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,600
She'd only been
in the country four months.

224
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,400
You knew her?

225
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Not really.

226
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,900
I was the head
of the drama department,

227
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,400
and she was a voice major,

228
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,100
so, you know,
we didn't interact much.

229
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,000
You remember
any students or faculty

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
she might have
called Zolotoi?

231
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,700
No, that doesn't
ring a bell.

232
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,500
We'll need the attendance

233
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,200
and disciplinary records
from that year.

234
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,700
- Nadia's files, yearbook, too.
- Anything you want.

235
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,000
See you have
an all-girl

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,600
fan club outside.

237
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,300
Nadia a member

238
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,500
when she was
a student?

239
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
I told you
we didn't interact much.

240
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,100
What about the night she died?

241
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,400
I was at home with my wife.

242
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
We were divorced 15 years ago,
but she'll remember.

243
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,100
We were... we were devastated

244
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,400
when we got the call.

245
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,200
Better luck second time around?

246
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,000
The third time's a charm.

247
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,500
We'll need a list
of her teachers.

248
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,400
Well, she only had one:
Phoebe Curtis.

249
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,700
FORMER STUDENT OF MINE.

250
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,600
One teacher?

251
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,100
How's that happen?

252
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,900
Phoebe taught
an advanced workshop.

253
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,300
Only eight students
were accepted,

254
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,600
and Nadia was one of them.

255
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,100
I understand
you were Nadia Koslov's teacher

256
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,200
at Regis.

257
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,800
She was in my
improv workshop.

258
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,400
I was an alumna, too.

259
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,000
Artist-in-residence.

260
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,400
Class of '77.

261
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,000
Voice major, right?

262
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,900
I'm a much better trophy wife
than I ever was a singer.

263
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,500
Who else was in your workshop?

264
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,900
A couple of kids
from each of the departments.

265
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,100
They collaborated in class,
and then completed

266
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,400
a final project.

267
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,700
This final project...

268
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,200
Nadia work with anyone
in particular?

269
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,700
Oh, no, it was
solo performance.

270
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,300
They had
to improvise

271
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,000
on the city streets, and then
submit a recording of it

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,100
for their final grade.

273
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,500
Like, on a cassette tape?

274
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,300
Or a videotape,
something like that.

275
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,600
You still have Nadia's?

276
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,500
She died before completing
the course work.

277
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,900
I never got to hear it.

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,600
When was the last time
you saw her?

279
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,000
In my class,
the day before she died.

280
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,200
Did Nadia ever have
any nicknames for you?

281
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,700
Not that I know of.

282
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,400
But I'm sure there was some
of that behind my back.

283
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,600
I had a reputation
for being demanding.

284
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,700
Any of her classmates
have any problems with her?

285
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,200
Nadia was a world-class soprano.

286
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,500
They were all jealous.

287
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,300
What they didn't realize is that

288
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,400
she was struggling
just as hard as they were.

289
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,000
<i>* Il n'a jamais *</i>

290
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,100
<i>HIGH SCHOOL FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS
* Jamais connu de loi *</i>

291
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,500
<i>* Si tu ne m'aimes *
Nadia.</i>

292
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,700
<i>* Pas je t'aime *
Nadia, I'm sorry.</i>

293
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,800
<i>* Si je... *
Nadia.</i>

294
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
I'm gonna have to
ask you to stop.

295
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,200
I did something wrong?

296
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,400
I asked you to prepare

297
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,800
<i>a piece that expresses
who you are.</i>

298
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,700
It is my signature aria.

299
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,900
I perform it in concert.

300
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,900
Nadia, I want
to hear your voice,

301
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
your soul,

302
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,900
not your technique.

303
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
But my father says...

304
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,300
I'm not talking
about your father.

305
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,800
I'm talking about you, Nadia.

306
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,400
<i>Who are you?</i>

307
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,600
Not what you think.

308
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,900
What you feel.

309
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,500
I don't know.

310
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,900
Okay.

311
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,600
Well, have a seat
until you figure it out.

312
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,000
Cyrus,

313
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,500
get up there
and open up a vein.

314
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Ow!

315
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,500
Nadia, what's
the problem?

316
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,900
Black roses.

317
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,900
I must have an admirer.

318
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,500
Maybe I was too hard on her.

319
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,700
You know, those kids
were tough enough on themselves.

320
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,900
And each other.

321
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,600
That girl at the door...

322
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,500
Chelsea.

323
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,600
Chelsea Cutler.

324
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,900
She had just lost her spot
in my workshop.

325
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,900
To Nadia.

326
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,900
Yes.

327
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,000
What's with the black roses?

328
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,800
They were Chelsea's thing.

329
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,200
She doodled them everywhere.

330
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,800
Had a black rose tattoo,
the whole nine.

331
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,300
After Nadia died,
you give her spot to anyone?

332
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,900
Well, since it
was available,

333
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,900
I gave it to Chelsea.

334
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,800
<i>Boss.</i>

335
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,400
What do you got, Kat?

336
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,300
Lab ID'd the substance
on Nadia's bag.

337
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,900
- Methyl salicylate.
- What is it?

338
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,300
It's a compound
found in aspirin

339
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,200
and muscle rubs.

340
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,800
This case, in something
called oil of wintergreen.

341
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Oil of wintergreen?

342
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,400
-  Saying she ingested it?
- Yep.

343
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,300
Found trace amounts
in her blood samples.

344
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,200
- Lab never tested it back in the day...
- 'Cause they thought

345
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
it was a wilding incident.

346
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,700
Trace amounts enough

347
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,100
to cause a fatal overdose?

348
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,700
Not usually,
but Nadia had asthma.

349
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,600
People like her...
aspirin compounds

350
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,900
can be highly toxic.

351
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,300
Would have happened
almost immediately.

352
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,600
Caused the cardiac arrest.

353
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,900
That's what
the ME said.

354
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,300
And get this.

355
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,200
Oil of wintergreen's
a coagulant.

356
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,300
Bruises would have gotten worse
after she died.

357
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,000
Making it look like
she had been beaten.

358
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,500
Nothing random
about this crime, boss.

359
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,100
Nadia was poisoned.

360
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,900
Oil of wintergreen's toxic?

361
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What, like, death
by breath mint?

362
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,800
In its concentrated form.

363
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,000
You know, little brown
glass dropper bottle.

364
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,700
Where did she
get the stuff?

365
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
No poisoning
Web sites in '89.

366
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,100
Well, any health food store.

367
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,100
Lucky for me,
not many around back then.

368
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,400
What the hell
is it used for?

369
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,600
Flavoring in candy,

370
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,800
fragrance in muscle rubs
and lip balms

371
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,400
and, uh, beekeeping.

372
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,300
Beekeeping?

373
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,500
"An essential oil for
promoting healthy swarms."

374
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,100
So, after tap class,

375
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,500
Chelsea Cutler's
tending her bees.

376
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,200
I'm working on it, okay?

377
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,400
Don't hate... and why do
you keep saying "she"?

378
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,100
- Could have been a guy, you know?
- Come on.

379
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
You know how the ladies
love to poison.

380
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,200
Better watch what you drink.

381
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,000
Sorry.

382
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,700
I needed some joe.

383
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,000
No problem.

384
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,300
Got her waiting.

385
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,500
So...

386
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,400
got any tattoos, Chelsea?

387
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,700
Tattoos?

388
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,400
I thought you wanted

389
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,100
to ask me about Nadia Koslov.

390
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,900
Like answers better
than questions around here.

391
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,600
Uh, yes, one.

392
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,500
A black rose.

393
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,800
Black roses.

394
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,600
That your thing back in '89?

395
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,800
Oh, God.

396
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What I did to Nadia
with the roses.

397
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,200
You think it was me?

398
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,600
Took careful planning
getting those things in her bag,

399
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,700
- no one seeing.
- Cunning and preparation:

400
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,400
two key ingredients
in homicidal poisoning.

401
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,500
Poisoning?

402
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,900
I thought it was a bunch
of guys in the subway.

403
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
It's a real personal way

404
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,200
of killing someone.

405
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,600
You remember
who got Nadia's spot

406
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,800
in Phoebe's workshop

407
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,100
after she died?

408
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,100
Please, I did not kill her.

409
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,700
Nadia was stealing

410
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,200
your spotlight;
you stole it back.

411
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,100
I was angry, and what I did
was totally stupid,

412
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,600
but once she got
into that workshop,

413
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,100
- she had much bigger problems than me.
- OH YEAH?

414
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,900
How is that?

415
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,600
Kids in that class
were the best of the best.

416
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,300
They got whatever they wanted.

417
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,300
And somebody wanted Nadia.

418
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,000
* Make my day *

419
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,800
* Pump up the jam *

420
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,700
* Pump it up
while your feet are stompin' *

421
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,100
* And the jam is pumpin' *

422
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,200
* Look at here the crowd
is jumpin', pump it up... *

423
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Career concept:
ditch the ethnic last name.

424
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,500
Move over, Madonna;
hello, Nadia.

425
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,700
* Find out if you're too bad *

426
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,100
* Nadia, oh, what can I say? *

427
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,700
* If you weren't so uptight,
you might make my day *

428
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,400
Whoo!

429
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,800
* Cyrus, baby,
if ego was a crime *

430
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,200
* You'd be chillin'
on death row *

431
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,100
* Doin' time, doin' time. *

432
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,600
You are so busted.

433
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Who knew?

434
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,900
She totally gets it.

435
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,000
A dance?

436
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,300
* Make my, make my,
make, make my day *

437
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
* Yo, pump up the jam *

438
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,600
* Pump it up, pump it up *

439
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,800
* Yo, pump it,
pump up the jam, pump it... *

440
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,400
They were attached
at the hip after that.

441
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,900
Never saw one without the other.

442
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,900
They still dating
when Nadia died?

443
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Hot and heavy.

444
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,500
Probably wouldn't
have thought twice...

445
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,600
till I saw him on a gay bar
crawl a couple years ago.

446
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,700
Gay?

447
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,300
You just said
he was dating a girl.

448
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,300
Exactly.

449
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,800
The guy was a mess.

450
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,300
DEAR PROFESSOR VRONKSY:
I AM A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE WORKING

451
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,500
TO SOLVE THE 1989 MURDER OF NADIA KOSLOV.

452
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
Couldn't sleep, either?

453
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah.

454
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,100
What do you got?

455
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,300
Pepperoni.

456
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,800
The books.

457
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,100
<i>Opera for Dummies.</i>

458
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,400
<i>I thought my life
was complicated.</i>

459
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,400
Plots in these things...
talk about twists and turns.

460
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,400
Anything with Zolotoi?

461
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,900
I looked for Zolotoi,
Golden One,

462
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,400
Gold... got nothing.

463
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,500
Except how many of them
have poisonings.

464
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,600
Popular way to go in opera.

465
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,500
How about you?

466
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,800
Looking in Regis directories,
Russian fables.

467
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,000
Even e-mailed a professor at the
St. Petersburg Conservatory.

468
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,100
Shot in the dark.

469
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,700
Shot in the dark's
better than nothing.

470
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,300
Zolotoi.

471
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
Yep, Zolotoi.

472
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,300
ZOLOTOI
"THE GOLDEN ONE"

473
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,500
You and Nadia close
back at Regis?

474
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Absolutely.

475
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,500
I wanted to write
musicals for her.

476
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,100
I was the songwriter;
she was the voice.

477
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,900
Thinking more
on the romantic tip.

478
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh. Yeah, we fooled around
a few times.

479
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,500
I guess you could say I was
an equal opportunity crush.

480
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,300
Bisexual.

481
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,300
- Right.
- Yeah, it wasn't until college

482
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,900
that I chose my major,
so to speak.

483
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,600
You sound like
a confused guy, Cyrus.

484
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,400
Getting close to
Nadia even though

485
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,100
you were on a different bus.

486
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,900
Maybe it was because
she was an outsider.

487
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,000
We just sort
of found each other.

488
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
- You two have any pet names?
- No.

489
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
But we certainly
did adore each other.

490
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,300
I haven't set foot back
in the subway since she was...

491
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,300
u know.

492
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,800
Ever hear her
use the word "Zolotoi"?

493
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
- The Golden One?
- No, she only spoke Russian
with her family.

494
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,400
With me, she shared the things
that she couldn't bring home.

495
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,100
Like what?

496
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
Her dreams.

497
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,400
Where you headed,
Miss Thing?

498
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,400
I'm going to talk to Nikki
about my final project.

499
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,500
Share. Now.

500
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Well, the other day,
singing with you

501
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,600
in the subway...

502
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,600
No, you're going to laugh.

503
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Never.

504
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,300
I know it sounds stupid,
but that was my voice.

505
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,200
You know, like
Phoebe said,

506
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,400
I was feeling, not thinking.

507
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,000
I want to be
the singer in a band.

508
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,800
A star is born!

509
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,900
Yeah, just don't tell my father.

510
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,300
He thinks
I'm preparing an opera.

511
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,800
Your father's,
like, in the KGB.

512
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,800
Only way
I'm talking to him

513
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,300
is if there's a gun to my head.

514
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,700
And Nikki's going
to be your backup dancer?

515
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,200
Well, I want her help
me with choreography.

516
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,900
I mean, if I stand there
in my ball gown

517
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,200
for another minute like this...

518
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,100
She's probably not
the greatest choice, Nadia.

519
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,300
Why not?
She's the best.

520
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,900
But she's so not a team player.

521
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,300
Stop gawking at me.

522
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,300
And get your pet Commie

523
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,400
- out of here.
- Nikki, what are you doing?

524
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,300
Warming up for three hours
on toe shoes.

525
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,600
What does it look like?

526
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,800
An overdose.

527
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,800
But you're good.

528
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,700
You're great.

529
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,600
- You don't need this stuff.
- What I need is

530
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,400
for you to get
the hell out here!

531
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,100
I'm gonna go get some help.

532
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,700
You're gonna
be all right...

533
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,100
Bitch, if you get anyone,
I swear to God

534
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,400
you'll wish you hadn't.

535
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,300
Nadia consider
herself warned?

536
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,600
I don't think so.

537
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,500
That same week, Regis

538
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,700
instituted
a zero-tolerance drug policy

539
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,200
and Nikki was expelled.

540
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,000
Well, how'd the prima
ballerina take it?

541
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,600
If she had a heart,
it would've been broken.

542
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,100
You were in
Phoebe Curtis's workshop?

543
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,400
Sure was.

544
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,100
The best of the best.

545
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,600
Couldn't find you
in the yearbook.

546
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,100
What happened between then
and graduation?

547
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,100
Regis wasn't preparing me
for the realities of the biz.

548
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,200
So I quit.

549
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,400
You "quit," huh?

550
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,300
So what's this?

551
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,700
- Looks like
"Papers of Expulsion"?
- Yours.

552
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,500
Nadia rats you out for drugs,
and you end up here.

553
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,000
So where were you,
night she died?

554
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,300
Truth this time.

555
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,500
I was too short
for a professional

556
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,000
corps de ballet.

557
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,900
Everyone tried to tell me.

558
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,500
But I wouldn't listen.

559
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,700
I punished myself instead.

560
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,700
Nothing an addict likes better

561
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
- than someone else to blame it on.
- Trust me.

562
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,800
My hatred was directed inward.

563
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
They had already kicked me out

564
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,400
when Nadia found me
in my dressing room.

565
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,700
We check with the school,
they gonna confirm that story?

566
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,700
I could care less what
the Regis faculty say about me.

567
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,900
Those losers couldn't do, teach,

568
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,100
or keep their hands
to themselves.

569
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,000
Think of the most painful

570
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,700
experience of your life.

571
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,300
Boil it down...

572
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,700
to one name.

573
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,400
And when you're ready,

574
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,200
say it out loud.

575
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Shout it,
if you have to.

576
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,700
But it's so hard to choose.

577
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,600
I have to go.

578
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,400
You're holding
onto something, Nadia.

579
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,700
You've got
to let it go.

580
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,600
"Holding on"?

581
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,700
I left my entire life behind.

582
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,500
I have nothing left
to hold onto.

583
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,800
Except the hurt.

584
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,700
It's come right along with you.

585
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,000
Running away is not
the same thing as letting go.

586
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,600
I'm trying.

587
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
I've seen

588
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,700
brilliant performers
self-destruct.

589
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,400
If you need my help...

590
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,400
I'll be there for you.

591
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Day or night.

592
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,400
Okay.

593
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,100
Elliot Glick took a special
interest in Nadia?

594
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,900
Like a heat-seeking missile.

595
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,800
What was in that

596
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,100
- little, brown bottle of his?
- I don't know.

597
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,600
Aromatherapy stuff?

598
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,100
What'd it smell like?

599
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,000
Minty.

600
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,500
Said you and Nadia
"didn't interact much."

601
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,900
Want to revise
that statement?

602
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,600
No.

603
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,800
- Been divorced twice already.
- Well, I don't see

604
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,600
what my marital history
has to do with Nadia Koslov.

605
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,900
Family court records
on their way.

606
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Might give us some insight

607
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,600
to the cause
of all those breakups.

608
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,400
Anything you want
to tell beforehand?

609
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,600
I have nothing to hide.

610
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,500
Delivery invoice
from Heart Mart,

611
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,700
your old neighborhood
health food store.

612
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,300
Read the highlighted part.

613
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,700
"Oil of wintergreen."

614
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,700
- You know that it was toxic?
- I was careful with it.

615
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,600
I used it for MEditating.

616
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,600
Witnesses saw you applying it
to minors, including Nadia.

617
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,400
Getting handsy
with her afterwards.

618
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,000
I was teaching The Method.

619
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,200
I was helping
my students

620
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,100
gain an emotional investment
in their work.

621
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,400
I gave my soul to those kids.

622
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,200
You were making a pass.

623
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,000
And when she rejected you,
you made her pay.

624
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,700
I didn't kill Nadia.

625
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,000
But I didn't protect her,
either.

626
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,500
Nadia.

627
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,200
Are you all right?

628
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,900
Katya.

629
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,900
- Excuse me?
- Katya.

630
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,200
The name I would've said
if I had courage.

631
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,000
Your mother.

632
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,500
Come here.

633
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,600
My father didn't let me go
to her funeral.

634
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,000
He didn't even
let me cry for her.

635
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,900
She was a big
deal soprano,

636
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,200
so instead of mourning,
we practiced.

637
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,200
I'm sorry.

638
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,800
Before we left, I wanted
to put roses on her grave.

639
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,200
But now I never can.

640
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,200
She would be
so proud of you.

641
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,700
I just wish she could hear
what I sound like.

642
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,100
Not in Russia, now.

643
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,500
Well, she can.

644
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,600
Go ahead.

645
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,100
LET HER HEAR WHAT YOU SING.

646
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,800
* And I see your true colors *

647
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,800
* Shining through *

648
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,300
* See your true colors *

649
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,700
* That's why I love you *

650
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,000
* To let them show... *

651
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,900
I stop by.

652
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,500
You not at opera.

653
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,300
- They say you quit.
- Mr. Koslov...

654
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,200
Papa! Papa!

655
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,900
- Hold on!
- Why are you not working?

656
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,800
I am!

657
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,300
<i>In here,
with this podunkum,</i>

658
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,600
<i>singing this khrenovyi</i>

659
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,800
Amerikansky pop?

660
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,300
My final project is due tonight,

661
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,100
and I will do it
the way that I want.

662
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,500
There is more
to life than opera.

663
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,500
Opera is our life.

664
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
I am not her, Papa.

665
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,700
This crap school,

666
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,500
it ruins us.

667
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
"Us"?

668
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,400
There is no us!

669
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,000
Just your dreams being shoved
down my throat.

670
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,900
A parent should encourage
his child's independence.

671
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,400
But Leo took Nadia's growth
as a personal betrayal.

672
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,500
He chased her
down the hall.

673
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,500
That was the last
time I saw her.

674
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,900
Hey, Nick,
I've got something.

675
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,000
A dean from St. Petersburg
Conservatory got back to us.

676
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
-  Yeah?
- Back in Russia, Leo Koslov

677
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,700
was a vocal coach
to some big careers,

678
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,300
including his wife's.

679
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,900
- Katya.
- She gave him a nickname and it stuck,

680
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,600
at least in opera circles.

681
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,800
Zolotoi.

682
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,600
The Golden One.

683
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,600
Nadia was saying a name
with her last breath.

684
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,300
And it was her father's.

685
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,600
Open a bottle of vodka,

686
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,900
can't leave the table
till it's done.

687
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,200
Russian tradition?

688
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,800
Grandpops, on my ma's side.

689
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,700
My Deyda.

690
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,100
Left Russia and came
to this country alone.

691
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,700
He was 14.

692
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,500
Wish I could ask him
more questions.

693
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,500
Listen to more of his stories.

694
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,600
TO THE WISDOM OF OUR ELDERS.

695
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,400
TO YOUR GRANDFATHER OF BLESSED MEMORY.

696
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,900
Never knew about your career
in the old country, Leo.

697
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Now I do.

698
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,700
With her dying breath,
Nadia said your name.

699
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,600
The glory days
of your family,

700
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,600
your career,

701
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,000
your marriage.

702
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,100
Zolotoi.

703
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,800
Why did you lie to me?

704
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,900
I thought
I could leave the past behind.

705
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,100
<i>Hamlet.</i>

706
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,600
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

707
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,900
Lacrazy Borga.

708
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,700
Lucrezia Borgia.

709
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,100
The great operas.

710
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Stories all had death
by poisoning.

711
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,500
Is that how you punished Nadia
for dishonoring you?

712
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,800
I am one who is punished
by fate.

713
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,400
You knew she had asthma.

714
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,700
You knew it would be quick.

715
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,400
Did that take the sting out
of what you were doing?

716
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,900
You think
I did not suffer enough?

717
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,000
Nadia made a tape
the day she died.

718
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,200
Empty case found
at the crime scene.

719
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,200
You have it, Leo?

720
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,900
Nadia had asked me
to grieve for all we had lost.

721
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,200
The last time I saw her,

722
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,500
she showed me the joy

723
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,800
that is possible
on the other side of grief.

724
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,900
* It's a long day *

725
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,500
* Living in Reseda *

726
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,900
* There's a freeway *

727
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,400
* RUNNING through their yard *

728
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,600
* And I'm a bad girl *

729
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,300
* 'Cause I don't even miss him *

730
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,500
* Hey, I'm a bad girl *

731
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,200
* For breaking his heart *

732
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,400
* And I'm free *

733
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,200
<i>* Free fallin' *</i>

734
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,100
<i>* Now I'm free fallin' *</i>

735
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,100
* Free fallin' *

736
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,100
<i>* Free fallin',
now I'm free fallin' *</i>

737
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,100
* Hey, I'm free *

738
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,200
<i>* And I'm free fallin',
now I'm free fallin' *</i>

739
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
* Free fallin' *

740
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,300
<i>* Now I'm free fallin',
now I'm free fallin' *</i>

741
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:39,200
<i>* Va', pensiero,
sull'ali dorate *</i>

742
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,000
<i>* Va', ti posa sui clivi,
sui colli *</i>

743
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,100
<i>* O veo lezza note pide molli *</i>

744
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,200
<i>* Free fallin',
now I'm free fallin' *</i>

745
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,200
<i>* L'au dolci del suo lo natal *</i>

746
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:03,200
<i>* O mio Patria,
s  bella perduta *</i>

747
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,800
<i>* O remembranza s  cara
e fatal *</i>

748
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,500
* And I'm free *

749
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,100
<i>* Free fallin',
now I'm free fallin' *</i>

750
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:21,100
<i>* Now I'm free fallin',
now I'm free fallin' *</i>

751
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:28,500
<i>* Now I'm free fallin',
now I'm free fallin', now... *</i>

752
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,400
You know "Va Pensiero?"

753
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,700
From an opera
by Verdi.

754
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,800
It's a famous song
about freedom

755
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,100
and also of homesickness.

756
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,900
The tape--

757
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,600
it was her final project

758
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,600
for the class that I cursed.

759
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,300
She knew you loved her.

760
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,700
But I never got a chance
to tell her that.

761
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,800
Elliot Glick's divorce
records were a goldmine.

762
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,300
Glick's exes
had a lot to say

763
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,100
about his extracurricular
activities.

764
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,300
He have a history
with his students?

765
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,900
Phoebe Curtis.

766
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,700
Major player
in his second divorce.

767
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,200
Ten years on and off.

768
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,500
Cornered his second wife

769
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,600
in a parking garage
with a crowbar.

770
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,600
And that was just
her opening act.

771
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,800
Would have been threatened
by Nadia

772
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,500
once Glick had his eyes on her.

773
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Well, Glick brought
oil of wintergreen

774
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,800
to Phoebe's apartment
for that acting thing.

775
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,600
Date on the cassette case
is the day Nadia died.

776
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,600
Missing tape
was her final project.

777
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,900
She might have gone
to Phoebe's house

778
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,900
to hand it in personally.

779
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,300
Phoebe lived two blocks

780
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,000
from the subway
where Nadia was found.

781
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,600
Get her down here.

782
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,600
Want you to think

783
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,700
of the most painful experience
in your life,

784
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,700
boil it down to a name,

785
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,200
and say it out loud.

786
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,400
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

787
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,500
Too hard to say
Elliot Glick's name?

788
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,200
Elliot and I
were friends.

789
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,000
Such good friends you
decided to harass his wife.

790
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,700
Only thing you forgot
was the antifreeze

791
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,800
and boiling bunny.

792
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,300
What made you

793
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,900
so mad, Phoebe?

794
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,700
You think he was
forgetting about you?

795
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,700
He wasn't forgetting about me.
I was his muse.

796
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,200
Sure, when you
still had potential.

797
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,900
But you start
acting up...

798
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,600
And he creates the
artist-in-residence position

799
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,400
to keep you close,

800
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,500
work a little
damage control.

801
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
I was a great teacher.

802
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,800
I inspired those kids.

803
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,200
Till Elliot found
his new muse,

804
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,800
Nadia Koslov.

805
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,200
Then you pull out
the oil of wintergreen,

806
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,600
and start making your plans.

807
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,700
Went back
to your old apartment, Pheebs.

808
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,000
Stuff's all
over the place.

809
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,300
Seeped through
the linoleum floors.

810
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,800
You're right.

811
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,200
I had a plan.

812
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,900
But it wasn't to kill Nadia.

813
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,100
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

814
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Elliot?

815
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,100
I wanted to kill myself.

816
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,600
That was my plan.

817
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,800
But you're sitting right here.

818
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
'Cause it wasn't
about Elliot anymore.

819
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,200
Not once you
heard that tape.

820
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Nadia had found her voice.

821
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,400
She was the real deal.

822
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,600
Elliot knew that.

823
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,900
So did you.

824
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,800
That kind of talent...

825
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,300
Made you realize
that you never had it.

826
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,000
That hurt.

827
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,300
Even more than him
not loving me.

828
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,200
Until

829
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,000
I got the idea that...

830
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,600
...if Nadia was gone...

831
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,100
Your problems would be, too.

832
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,200
I'm sorry.

833
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,100
I'm so sorry.

834
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,800
<i>* O remembranza s  cara
e fatal *</i>

835
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,400
* And I'm free... *

836
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,200
Phoebe, are you okay?

837
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,300
It's...
It's beautiful.

838
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,600
You're the one
who taught me HOW to feel.

839
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,100
I felt my mother in my heart,

840
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,500
and I sang for her.

841
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,600
Elliot says

842
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,500
running away is not
the same thing as letting go.

843
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,300
Maybe that's
why you're sad.

844
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,400
I made this for myself.

845
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,300
It's, uh, good for your throat.

846
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,600
You take it.

847
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
You're the real singer
in this room.

848
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
Go ahead.

849
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,500
Thank you.

850
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,800
Come on.
Let's get you to the train.

851
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,000
* You with the sad eyes *

852
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,100
* Don't be discouraged *

853
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,500
* Oh, I realize *

854
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,900
* It's hard to take courage *

855
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:18,500
* In a world full of people,
you can lose sight of it all *

856
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,300
* And the darkness inside you
make you feel so small *

857
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,900
* But I see your true colors
shining through *

858
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,300
* I see your true colors *

859
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,100
* And that's why I love you *

860
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:40,500
* So don't be afraid
to let them show *

861
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,800
* Your true colors *

862
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:53,200
* True colors are beautiful
like a rainbow *

863
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,800
* Show me a smile then *

864
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,800
* Don't be unhappy *

865
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,300
* Can't remember when I *

866
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,800
* Last saw you laughing *

867
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,200
* If this world
makes you crazy *

868
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,300
* And you've taken
all you can bear *

869
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:22,300
* You call me up
because you know I'll be there *

870
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,800
* And I'll see
your true colors *

871
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,500
* And that's why I love you *

872
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:34,700
* So don't be afraid
to let them show *

873
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,100
* Your true colors *

874
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:48,100
* True colors are beautiful
like a rainbow. *
