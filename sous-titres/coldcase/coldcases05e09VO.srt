00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,580
September 16,1963

2
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,480
would you mind?

3
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,550
watch this,baby doll.

4
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,340
leave the new kid alone,red.

5
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,870
what's your bag,man?

6
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,560
gloria thinks the new kid's cherry.

7
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,440
you're thicker than a five-dollar
malt,surprised you can read.

8
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,850
what the hell?

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
look at what we got here!

10
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,940
he's a she!

11
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,600
and he's a jackass!

12
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,080
boss wants to see me.

13
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,090
iad is wrapping it up,finally.

14
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,300
what do you got?

15
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,260
well,vera's talking to this
guy-- info on a floater from '63.

16
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,810
drowned in a lake at fdr.

17
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,940
he got a name?

18
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,480
she.

19
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,100
wait,that's a boy.

20
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,700
- right?
- wrong.

21
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,250
samantha randall,16.

22
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,840
the body washed up a
half-mile down from the bridge.

23
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,600
suicide point--
that bridge.

24
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,320
ain't our jurisdiction
when teenagers jump.

25
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,690
only our guy says she didn't.

26
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,790
i've been a drunk my whole life,but i...

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,140
i got sober this year.

28
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,680
i got six months.

29
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,620
good for you.

30
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,500
in aa,they say that you're
only sick as your secrets.

31
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,250
anytime you want to
get to the point,bub.

32
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,350
the point is,everybody said
that girl jumped from the bridge,

33
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,640
but she didn't.

34
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,450
and how do you know?

35
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,310
'cause i was on the bridge that night.

36
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,270
well,maybe your memory's a little fuzzy.

37
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,160
i heard a car pull up and
then this little splash.

38
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,690
i look down in the water and a
girl floats by right in front of me.

39
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,950
you're here to clear your
conscience,right,maurice?

40
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,780
so why don't you save us the
song and dance,admit you did it.

41
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,090
i admit those were dark
times,but not that dark.

42
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,280
the only one i was killing was myself.

43
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,240
there's no water in her lungs.

44
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,590
not likely she drowned.

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,770
saying she was dead
when she hit the water?

46
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,190
no one caught it back then?

47
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,040
wasn't going for a midnight
swim in this red dress.

48
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,100
so somebody dumped her.

49
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,970
tough to kill yourself
if you're already dead.

53
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,000
you wanted to see me,boss?

54
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,780
have a seat,scotty.

55
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,380
nah,i'm...good.

56
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,610
iad is recommending
suspension-- 30 days,unpaid.

57
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,490
just like that,huh?

58
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,250
they're citing procedure,perimeter.

59
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,700
you've been around long
enough to know how it goes.

60
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,240
so,do i just... leave now?

61
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,980
if i thought you were
wrong,you'd be gone by now.

62
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,070
get back to work.

63
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,550
yeah,but...

64
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,620
i'm suspended,right?

65
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,400
they're commended suspension.

66
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,120
so,you got to come up with a
counteroffer now,or something?

67
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,620
do your job,scotty; let me do mine.

68
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,430
samantha randall,some kids found
her body washed up at fdr park.

69
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,090
yup,it's a girl.

70
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,300
not where i come from.

71
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,250
i was a tomboy when i was little.

72
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,330
used to beat my brothers arm wrestling.

73
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,500
guessing you didn't
take it this far,though.

74
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,790
to each their own.

75
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,850
a classmate said samantha
only wore boys' clothes.

76
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,130
until the night she died,that is.

77
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,380
well,she was the new kid in town.

78
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,300
enrolled at grays ferry high school,

79
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,650
couple months before she died.

80
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,310
kids must've loved her.

81
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,250
the cops ruled it a
suicide,chalked it up to her...

82
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,350
behavior problem.

83
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,170
ran away from home every few weeks,

84
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,710
had three arrests for
public intoxication.

85
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,910
we thinking she was gay?

86
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,410
back in '63 that was a disease.

87
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,970
could've been acting out,confused.

88
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,780
doer might've taught "the freak" a lesson.

89
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,840
put her in a dress to
drive the point home.

90
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,750
so how did she die?

91
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,710
the marks on her temples
might be bruises,burns?

92
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,210
i'll see if she got family left.

93
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,300
find out just how rough
this tomboy had it.

94
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,140
archie randall?

95
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,450
you found him.

96
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,700
philly homicide.

97
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,740
i got some questions,if you don't mind.

98
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,280
homicide?

99
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,260
what is this?

100
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,710
maybe you'd like to speak in private.

101
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,530
finish without me.

102
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,500
i'm looking into your daughter's death.

103
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,840
i don't understand.

104
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,750
sam... killed herself.

105
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,540
you told officers she was
having behavior problems.

106
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,730
well,you would,too,if your
mom died when you were little.

107
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,900
i raised her on my own.

108
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,630
did the best i could anyway.

109
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,900
was she always a tomboy?

110
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,770
like the son i never had.

111
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,740
she loved to build tree
forts and play in the mud.

112
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,090
but... around age 12,trouble started.

113
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,670
what kind of troubles?

114
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,720
oh,sassing her teachers and
skipping school and fighting.

115
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,750
got kicked out of...

116
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,640
a few high schools upstate.

117
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,860
that why you moved to grays ferry?

118
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,220
twice we had to pack up
and move to a new town.

119
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,560
we were damned lucky not
to end up in the poorhouse.

120
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,560
i hope you don't mind me asking,but
sam's alternative behaviour.

121
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,340
How far did it go?

122
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,100
I'm not sure i catch your meaning.

123
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,940
Did your kary prefer the
company of other girls?

124
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,060
No,no,no,no.

125
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,800
She wasn't one of those.

126
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,350
Can you think of anyone who
would want to hurt your daughter?

127
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,200
I got to admit,sam didn't
have a lot of friends.

128
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,280
She always acted like it
was her against the world.

129
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,680
It's hard Adjusting to a new school,

130
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,730
isn't that right,tim?

131
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,390
Red picked on me so why am
i the one brought in herE.

132
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,560
Because you can't come to
school dressed like that.

133
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,860
You want to me to dress like a girl?

134
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,770
Because it will make them feel better.

135
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,050
You will dress like a girl
because you're a girl.samantha

136
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,810
It's sam

137
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,410
Sam is a boy's name, let gets this straight

138
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,050
You will go by samantha at school

139
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,490
Did your mother ever take
you shopping for clothes,dear?

140
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,970
She mass a closet
full of skirts at home.

141
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,540
Price tags on all of them.

142
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,540
Girls like her run into
trouble later on in life.

143
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,070
Personality disorders. Alcohol abuse.

144
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,170
There are places that can help
her if she's not willing to change.

145
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,600
Let's nip this in the bud now,shall we?

146
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,150
Why can't i just be who i am.

147
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,730
And who or what exactly is that?

148
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,670
Now,it says here you've
registered for shop class.

149
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,670
Yeah.

150
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,590
I want to learn how to build
a turbo engine from scratch.

151
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,480
I've taken the liberty of enrolling
you in home economics instead.

152
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,750
Why? So I can change diapers and mick
cups of coffee for people like you.

153
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,280
Sam

154
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,280
Why don't you leave me alone.

155
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,280
The new kid,you get the dress yet?

156
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,310
What dress.

157
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,520
Every since home room everyone's saying
you're the shoon-in for homecoming.

158
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,090
*******

159
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,210
You must be real proud.

160
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,330
Tom Baring What a surprise.

161
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,770
Excuse me.

162
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,300
No one was on her side,not even me.

163
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,420
This tom baring,he said
sam should wear a dress?

164
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,880
Kids were always cruel to her.

165
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,450
Did he and sam ever get into it again?

166
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,560
I don't know.

167
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,490
She shut me out of her life.

168
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,010
I guess i can't blame her.

169
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,460
Thank you for your time,mr.Randall.

170
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,590
I used to tell her it's a phase.

171
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,250
When you're older,you will look back

172
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,770
and laugh at yourself
for acting this way.

173
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,110
Guess i was wrong.

174
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,780
Here to pick up or place an order?

175
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,140
Neither.

176
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,530
We want to talk to
you about sam randall.

177
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,470
That's a name i haven't
heard in a while.

178
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,140
She died,back in '62,'63,right?

179
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,090
November,'63.

180
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,560
We think someone killed her.

181
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,520
My god.

182
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,450
Found wearing a dress.

183
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,620
Just like you said she should.

184
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,870
I used to shoot my
mouth off all the time.

185
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,990
Thought i was a real bad ass
but i was just a bored kid.

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,590
Had quite a rap sheet
at the tender age of 16.

187
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,190
Breakfasting and entering*************

188
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,900
And i skipped school too. Do
you want it write that down.

189
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,610
I didn't kill her

190
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,210
where were you the night she died?

191
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,960
Home,trying to keep dad
from beating mom unconscious.

192
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,350
Real norman rockwell stuff.

193
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,940
She pissed you off,didn't she?sam?

194
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,080
Oh,yeah,she pissed everyone off
much that's what i liked about her.

195
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,290
And you got familiar?

196
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,130
That must have hurt her reputation.

197
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,140
I didn't give a damn what
the other kids thought.

198
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,250
We both didn'T.

199
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,400
It made us cool.

200
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,460
How did this great friendship start?

201
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,490
Bunch of guys used to
drag race out in the pines.

202
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:32,290
Once sam found out about
it,nothing could keep her away.

203
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,300
*******

204
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,700
Thought you would chicken out.

205
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,050
I wouldn't miss it for the world,red.

206
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,680
********

207
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,870
What are you squawking about?
I spent a month working on this.

208
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,670
How much gas have you got in there?

209
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,550
About a quarter tank.

210
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,730
Too much. Pop it.

211
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,880
Hey,what are you doing?

212
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,710
I don't let just anyone touch my car.

213
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,630
I know everything about engines.

214
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,240
Trust me,will you.

215
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,690
Man,you must be desperate.

216
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,290
So,red,what are we racing for?

217
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,120
How about pink slips.

218
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,870
You can keep that gentleman loppy.

219
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,230
How about her instead.

220
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,140
One day

221
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,300
Deal.

222
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,000
My car for your girl.

223
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,410
He's going to leave you
in the dust candy ass.

224
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,770
We?

225
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,600
Yeah,we're partners.

226
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,240
Race some rubber.

227
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,930
Ready?

228
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,980
Go!

229
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,790
What did you put in the tank?

230
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,150
Moonshine.

231
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,020
Told you you would win,didn't I?

232
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,630
Full of all sorts of
surprises,aren't new.

233
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,320
You cheated,you freak.

234
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,570
*******

235
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,330
We won fair and square,red.

236
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,260
Layoff the kid.

237
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,470
You think you can screw red buckley
over,you're crazier than you look.

238
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,030
Sam was fun.

239
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,440
And she knew what it was
like to be an outsider.

240
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,400
Like you.

241
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,780
Sam was my only friend.

242
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,200
Bingo in both ways.

243
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,660
You never thought to go
to the cops about this.

244
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,360
I didn't think it mattered.

245
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,910
They said she killed herself.

246
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,460
What about red?

247
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,340
Did he ever make good on his threat?

248
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,260
Must have.

249
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,880
If she didn't kill herself,right?

250
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,210
Thanks for your time.

251
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,500
The town bully,lost his pride
and his girl in the same night.

252
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,620
*********

253
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,130
********

254
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,360
Is he giving gordon hell?

255
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,840
And the chief of detectives.

256
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,670
Guess I should pack my bags.

257
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,930
Look like john's giving
as good as he gets.

258
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,400
Red buckley.

259
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,890
I've been asking around about you.

260
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,070
If I knew cops were this cute I
would have come in sooner.********

261
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,010
You have quite the bad boy
reputation in high school.

262
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,000
Ladies man,in the hot rod.

263
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,000
Still got that little chevy in my
backyard if you would like to take a spin.

264
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,880
Something.

265
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,240
People are still talking about
those drag races out in the ponds.

266
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,170
Undefeated.

267
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,920
All through high school.

268
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,800
That car was a rocket.

269
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,360
Actually,i heard different.

270
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,530
One legendary night,

271
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,180
you got served your ass
on a plate,by a girl.

272
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,970
Who,sam randall?

273
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,930
That wasn't a girl.

274
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,590
You bullied sam.

275
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,050
Hated her for showing you up.

276
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,100
If she would just put on a skirt.

277
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,150
Us guys would have let her be.

278
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,890
Threatened by her,weren't you?

279
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,460
Freaked out more like.

280
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,830
Everyone was,even the girls.

281
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,480
Are you saying she
got into it with them?

282
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,120
You know how you females can be.

283
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,420
Vicious.

284
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,670
Live it up gals,rent a hungry man.

285
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,890
I I believe you get credit for this.

286
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,390
Red nose whot winner is.

287
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,460
He's tasted my pie before.

288
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,860
I bet he has.

289
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,640
Sorry,son!

290
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,440
Did you say something?

291
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,780
Don't be A*****

292
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,740
Nice apron.

293
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,610
You got to try lipstick some time.

294
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,490
So I can look like a dip,too?

295
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,630
At least I'm not a lesbo.

296
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,080
How many hours a day
are you taking it on?

297
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,760
Stuffing your bra?

298
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,240
Just wondering.

299
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,210
These are primo 100% real.

300
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,740
You should try it.

301
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,410
Looking like a girl,i mean.

302
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,310
A lot of work being a skirt.

303
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,420
No thanks.

304
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:46,160
Look,butch,I don't know how
they dress at your last school

305
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,900
but at grace ferry,girls look like this.

306
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,280
You might want to take some notes.

307
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,230
Looks like someone is
a pony missing its tale.

308
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,980
*******

309
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,530
You messed with the wrong girl.

310
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,180
Sounds like janey had
a nasty little temper.

311
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,130
Once,a chick winked at me
jenny gave her a black eye.

312
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,850
And sam grabbed the tiara right off the
beauty beaten queen's head so to speak.

313
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,840
*******

314
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,030
Where were you the night sam died?

315
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,340
at home coming dance.

316
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,540
Spent most of the night behind
the gym trying to get something.

317
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,090
I'll track melissa down.

318
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,590
See what she said.

319
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,540
Let me know if she's single.

320
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,950
Sam randall made a fool out
of you,exposed you as a fake.

321
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,300
And she was right.

322
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,160
I was the bell of the ball with
my bullet bra and war paint.

323
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,090
I take it you're more
involved than that now?

324
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,370
I like to think so.

325
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,300
What made you change,janey?

326
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,950
Guilt,maybe?

327
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,710
No,living through the feminist
movement,it changed my life.

328
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,650
Come a long way since high school.

329
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,460
When you threatened sam randall.

330
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,430
Look,I was a bitch on wheels back then.

331
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,710
I wasn't proud of it.

332
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,240
Sam frightened me.

333
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,580
She did more than frighten you.

334
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,390
She turned you into a punch line.

335
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,380
*****

336
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,180
I had to score a
settle but not with sam.

337
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,310
Sam's friend dom.

338
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,510
He stood me up for our stupid date.

339
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,940
What does this have to
do with sam's murder?

340
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,470
I went to find him. giving a peace of my mind

341
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,630
He and sam were at the lake.

342
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,560
*******

343
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,860
The regular hangout.

344
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,920
That's when I found
out what sam really was.

345
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,610
Damn,it's hot.

346
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,110

Trying to make you something you're not.

355

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,730
It's just the way i am.

359
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,920
I don't know what that makes me.

360
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,110
Feels right,you know.

361
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,980
I think so.

362
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:21,040
And i used to get match
box cars every christmas.

363
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,770
He brought me a barbie
and i balled my eyes out.

364
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,650
I'm not trying to be like anybody else.

365
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,580
Just me.

366
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,240
We'll never let them change you.

367
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,180
Always be free. I'll die trying.

368
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,330
Really?

369
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,940
Yeah.

370
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,170
You like chicks the way i do.

371
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,460
No,

372
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,820
what do you like?

373
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,050
I like you...

374
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,700
- What the hell are you doing?
- I don't know.

375
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,350
I'm not some queer.

376
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,950
- I just wants to be with you,dom,I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

377
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,340
Try that again,and
i'll beat your head in.

378
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,940
Dom

379
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,420
I know it was confusing.

380
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,460
You can say that again.

381
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:47,740
And i made sure it got
around the next day at school.

382
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,630
Excuse me.

383
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:58,020
So the gender bending girl makes a
pass at a bad boy and everyone knows.

384
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,210
Maybe dom wasn't such a
sensitive guy after all.

385
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:08,530
She was a boy inside of
a girl who liked a boy?

386
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,310
That about sums it up.

387
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,610
Make my head hurt here.

388
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,710
Yes,probably why cops
dropped it like a hot potato.

389
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,760
Still don't explain
the marks on her head.

390
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,410
Or why she ended up in girl's
clothes the night she died.

391
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,510
Dom's got a little explaining to do.

392
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,150
Will,want to step in for a second?

393
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,470
Sure.

394
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,370
I'm going to need you to keep an eye on
things around here for a little while.

395
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,980
What do you mean?

396
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,680
You're the senior man on the squad.

397
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,740
Listen,you have a seat.

398
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,070
What's going on,john?

399
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,360
I'm going to have to take a
30-day rest,starting friday.

400
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,240
I can use the time,i haven't
been fishing in six years.

401
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,230
Ied,they're suspending you?

402
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,680
I told them i signed off
the shooting in barely.

403
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,480
To they's hands were tied.

404
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,910
You're taking the hit.

405
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,700
Scotty's a good cop.

406
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,750
He doesn't need some stink on his rap.

407
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,670
And do you?

408
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,600
I'm set.

409
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,830
I've been around long enough, i don't have
to worry about what is coming after mE.

410
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,930
I don't know what to say.

411
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,160
Say you will keep the trains running.

412
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,930
- Just for 30 days.
- Who knows?

413
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,470
I might take a shine to it.

414
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,620
Come on,you can't leave us.

415
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,590
At what part? The hours,the politics?

416
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,790
Seriously,john,what are you going to do?

417
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,130
I don't know.

418
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,590
Maybe it's time i found out.

419
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,000
The lazy afternoons fishing.

420
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,030
To old friends.

421
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,710
Amen to that.

422
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,700
I heard sam got fresh
with you at the lake.

423
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,830
In '63,common clenches of
a girl who looks like a boy.

424
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,970
I didn't kiss her.

425
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,860
Witnesses say it got hot and heavy.

426
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,570
I'm not that way.

427
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,460
What way?

428
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,480
Sam looked like boy.

429
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,340
You've seen pictures.

430
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,600
It was confusing.

431
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:22,950
I bet it was.

432
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,640
Especially when the
whole school found out.

433
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,250
And you your buddy,

434
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,720
made you a little
involved by association.

435
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,900
***********And get rid of the freak.

436
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,830
She wasn't freak.

437
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,980
She...

438
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,430
she was just lost.

439
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,930
I should have handled it differently.

440
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,700
- And not killed her you mean.
- I didn't kill her.

441
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,210
I shut her out,i gave
her the cold shoulder.

442
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,710
But you didn't give a damn about
what the other kids thought,right?

443
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,900
Wrong.

444
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,970
I did.

445
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,790
And i abandoned sam
when she needed me the most.

446
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,810
Looky here.She's crying.

447
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,740
Boys don't cry.

448
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,850
Are you a boy,huh?

449
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,890
Or you just like kissing them.

450
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,030
So you a queer now,too?

451
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,710
Makeup your mind what you are,freak.

452
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,370
You want to get with boys,you
got to look like a girl.

453
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,670
*******

454
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,030
Queer!

455
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,330
You******

456
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,170
No

457
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,610
- Hold her still
- Hold her still

458
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,100
- No
- samatha randol

459
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,380
my office now

460
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,690
Sam had more guts and integrity than
anyone in that school,including me.

461
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,220
What did the principal do?

462
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,830
Called her father.

463
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,790
Yanked her out of school,i guess.

464
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,690
Sam was expelled?

465
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,440
Her dad came to pick her up that day.

466
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,010
I never saw her again.

467
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,750
But you lied to us,had
to pull up six again,

468
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,540
maybe he didn't have
anymore moves left in him?

469
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,110
Never told us sam got kicked out
of the grace ferry. What was that?

470
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,030
Third high school in three years.

471
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,930
A not sure what you're getting at here.

472
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,580
Your daughter thought she was a
boy and had a nasty temper to boot.

473
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,510
I loved sam.

474
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,670
Only wanted what was best for her.

475
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,630
Couldn't move again,though,couldn't?

476
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,100
You were at your wits ends.

477
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,800
I didn't know what else to do.

478
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,970
So you lost your temper?

479
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:27,920
Maybe things got out of
hand,you hit her archy?

480
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,460
Oh,no

481
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,900
I did something much worse.

482
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,500
Her diagnosis is gender
identity disorder.

483
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:44,320
****We keep girls like samantha
to dress,talk and walk like ladies.

484
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,940
How,what will you do to her?

485
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,680
Behaviour moifbs,medication,

486
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,690
worst case scenario,electro
con vuflsive therapy.

487
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,210
I don't know about that.

488
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,510
You are do want what's
best for your daughter?

489
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,630
Of course i do but sam's never
been away from home before.

490
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,340
We can help her.

491
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,900
Just last month a former patient
got engaged to be married.

492
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,770
Get me out of here.

493
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,610
Don't make it harder.

494
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,710
I'll be a girl,please,I'll
wear whatever you want.

495
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,100
She won't need these boys' clothes.

496
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,880
Samantha will be wearing
a dress like a normal girl.

497
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,910
Daddy,please don't make me stay here.

498
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,360
I'm sorry,samantha,i love
you but it's the only way.

499
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,750
No,daddy,I'll be good.

500
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,820
Daddy,please.

501
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,520
Daddy,please!

502
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,140
No!

503
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,120
I'll be good.

504
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,190
I'll be good.I promise!

505
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,940
She was calling for me
and i just walked away.

506
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,110
I thought i was doing the right thing.

507
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,900
How long was she at that hospital?

508
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,750
Two weeks.

509
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,060
And then she ran away.

510
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,050
That's what they told me.

511
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,320
Same night she died?

512
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,900
Maybe.

513
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:15,450
Maybe if she wasn't scared,i
would bring her back to that place.

514
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,840
Maybe she would have come home.

515
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,200
Thanks for your time,mR.Randall.

Jeffrey said you're
taking my suspension.

537
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,970
It wasn't yours to take,scotty.

538
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,060
********

539
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,880
Water under the bridge. It's done.

540
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:51,100
Thanks for... looking out.

541
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,870
Leonard is waiting.

542
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,220
Right.

543
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,630
You coming,boss?

544
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,040
As i said,i baring remember the girl.

545
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:18,660
*******Hard to keep them all straight.

546
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,140
We know about the other
zombies the hospital turned out.

547
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,860
Three,to be exact.

548
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,950
All under your care.

549
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,460
It was horrible what they were doing
to those young people. Terrible.

550
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,070
You just stood by and let it happened.

551
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,010
Doctors don't listen to nurses.

552
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,440
It was out of my hands.

553
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,180
Why did you quit?

554
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,330
After sam died,you
just ran for the hills.

555
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,820
I didn't run for any damn hills.

556
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:47,200
My whole life I've been holding my
tongue,watching men make mistakes.

557
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,370
But i begged dr.Cancer to stop.

558
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,370
But doctors don't listen to nurses.

559
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,130
I thought thought we were
helping in the beginning

560
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,280
but sam had so much fight in her.

561
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,880
They did everything they
could to snuff it out.

562
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,660
And one more time,pull out your chair...

563
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:20,390
lower yourself slowly
into the seat,don't plop.

564
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,950
Excellent progress,samantha.

565
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:29,800
Don't scrape the chair if he felicia.

566
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,840
And hands in your lap.

567
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,180
Lovely.Louise,

568
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,490
Louise,do you want dr.Kearns to
sends you back to the ect room?

569
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,860
Now,let's move on to grooming.

570
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,170
Today is lipstick.

571
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,140
Remove the cap.

572
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,990
Place the lid on the table.

573
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,190
Hold the compact mirror
open in yoeftur l palm.

574
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:24,020
Now start at the centre of the
upper lip and move down to the right.

575
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,570
No.

576
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,000
You must participate if
you're going get better.

577
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,710
But I can't get better if I'm not sick.

578
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,180
You know this isn't right.

579
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:42,490
You have no idea what these
people are capable of,sam.

580
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,190
Just Do it.

581
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,560
Put on the lipstick,now!

582
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,510
You put on the lipstick,buster.

583
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,280
And while you're at it,take this!

584
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,270
I'm not crazy.

585
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,090
This is crazy. Not me.

586
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,700
You will behave like a young lady.

587
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,760
You call me a lady or a freak...

588
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,420
there's nothing wrong with mE.

589
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,590
No!

590
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,170
No!

591
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,070
Sam was right.

592
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,860
There was nothing wrong with her.

593
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,800
I just couldn't stand
watching them destroy her.

594
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,810
So i quit.

595
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,370
Left her there to rot,too.

596
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,590
Real noble of you.

597
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,520
I found a friends of hers from school
and i let him know what happened.

598
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,950
A friend?

599
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,250
You mean donald aaron?

600
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,450
He was the only one who talked to her.

601
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,450
He seemed to be the type
who would do the right thing,

602
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,420
even if he had to do
something against the rules.

603
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,140
But you told him to save her?

604
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:54,380
It was my first and
last act of rebellion.

605
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,710
How did he get past the hospital gate?

606
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,190
I gave him the key.

607
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,510
Beautiful work.

608
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,020
You're not here to talk
about stained glass,are you?

609
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,000
Same image,over and over.

610
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,900
Every piece,that...

611
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,390
one figure.

612
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,600
Alone against the world.

613
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,650
Kind of like sam.

614
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,440
I already told you,we were just friends.

615
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,620
Hard to believe. Seeing this.

616
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,370
Hypothetically speaking,if
you love a girl,

617
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,470
who is actually a boy
inside,what does that make new.

618
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,480
I... i didn'T...

619
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,760
love sam.

620
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,450
Why did you save her?

621
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,230
Boy girl,his words,right?

622
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,200
*******not what is in here.

623
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,240
why do you doing this?

624
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:16,770
You made a deal at the lake to
never let them change you,die trying.

625
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,160
That's why you brought her back there,

626
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,820
the one place she could be free.

627
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:26,250
She was.

628
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,560
Free.

629
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,690
In the ends.

630
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,820
i made sure of that.

631
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:40,750
You didn't put a name on
it but it still matters.

632
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,300
It Was the only thing that mattered.

633
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,330
That's why i went to her.

634
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,560
Come on,sam.

635
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,070
Let's go,we're getting
out of here. Let's gO.

636
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,890
Sam.

637
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,660
Sam?

638
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,930
Come back,come back.

639
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,390
Please,sam.

640
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,850
Just come back.

641
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,080
******You've got to come back.

642
00:39:56,090 --> 00:40:00,250
We had a deal,remember.

643
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,560
Is he lake,we can never
let them change us.

644
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,940
We can always be free or die trying,huh?

645
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,690
You remember?

646
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,650
Make me free.

647
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,270
All right.

648
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,230
I can't,

649
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,230
i won't,i won't do that,sam.

650
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,600
I won't,no way,no way.

651
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,770
I know you're in there,sam.

652
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,230
I know it's you.

653
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,030
But I won't do that,you hear me,i won'T.

654
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,300
I won'T.

655
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,780
*****

656
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,100
Now****
