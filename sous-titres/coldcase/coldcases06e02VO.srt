<i>"Right here, right now"
by Jesus Jones.</i>

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,600
Dad...

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,300
It's too much.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,500
Well, it's yours, baby.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,100
They have public transportation
in Philadelphia, you know.

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,400
Now you won't
have to use it.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,100
Dad, you've got to
stop worrying about me.

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,900
I'm gonna be fine.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,100
Your degree, your brains...

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,100
you could do anything you want.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,400
Law school, politics, Wall Street...

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,000
But Dad...

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,400
this is what I want.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,300
Laura McKinney ?

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,300
I'm Margaret Trudlow.
You're late.

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,200
Sorry. Got a little lost.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,800
We have an unexpected
change in faculty.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,800
One of our US History teachers,
Mr. Hack, had an incident.

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,900
"Incident" ?

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,100
Run-in with some
seniors last year.

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,300
Nothing for you
to worry about,

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,600
but you'll cover
his class this year.

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
I'm supposed to teach English.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,600
I'm not familiar
with US History.

26
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,200
Neither are the students.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,700
No problem.

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,100
Ready for the challenge.

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,800
That's the Ivy League spirit.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,400
This is yours.

31
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,400
My classroom's next door
if you have any issues,

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,300
but I'm sure you won't.

33
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,600
Any advice ?

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,800
Show no fear.

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,800
Hi, class.

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,400
My name's Miss McKinney.

37
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,700
Can you turn that down, please ?

38
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Excuse me.
Settle down, guys.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
Can you please take your seat ?

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,600
Hey !

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,200
Stop it !
Stop it !

42
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,500
Someone helping you ?

43
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,100
They told me to wait for
one of those detectives.

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,400
One sec.

45
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,200
Hmm, they look pretty busy.

46
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,600
Why don't you talk to me ?

47
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,700
Darnell Brent.

48
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,400
I'm Detective Rush.

49
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,500
Think I have evidence
on Laura McKinney's murder.

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,000
She was my teacher
at Reeves High,

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,900
got shot outside
the school in 1991.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,700
They said it was
a carjacking gone wrong.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,100
You know different ?

54
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,400
Just got my teaching credential.

55
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,100
Started at Reeves last week.

56
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,700
Coincidence ?

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,300
She's the reason I'm doing it.

58
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,100
Always challenged us
to make a difference.

59
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,600
Figured it was
about time I tried.

60
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,100
What'd you find, Darnell ?

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,500
So I'm there this weekend,
getting my classroom ready.

62
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,600
Found this old,
sturdy desk in storage

63
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:50,301
they used to have
when I was a student.

64
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,500
I was going through the drawers,

65
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,100
and I find these.

66
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,100
They're her keys,
including her car keys.

67
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,000
Miss McKinney wouldn't have left
the classroom without them,

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,400
never mind the building.

69
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,400
People forget their keys
all the time.

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,700
I've worked at the school two days.

71
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,100
First thing you learn, don't go
anywhere without your keys.

72
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,000
The school's locked down ?

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,900
Especially at night.

74
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,500
Can't get from one door
to the other without them.

75
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,000
Miss McKinney would've known that.

76
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,600
She wasn't going to her car.

77
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,700
So if she wasn't
headed to her car,

78
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,900
where was she going?

79
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,300
I don't know.

80
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,100
I've got to say, Darnell,

81
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,300
not a lot to go on.

82
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,700
Look, I know you're busy.

83
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,600
But I can't let this sit.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,200
After everything
Miss McKinney did for me...

85
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Sounds like
she was a special teacher.

86
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,700
Yeah... the best.

87
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,000
I owe her.

88
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,100
<font color="#ffff00">Cold Case S06E02</font>

91
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,300
It was Valens, right ?

92
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,400
He still hot over that
pudding pop thing last month ?

93
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,200
I'm no snitch.

94
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,300
You're either with me
or you're against me.

95
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,700
Consider me warned.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,400
Laura McKinney,

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,000
22, just out of college.

98
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,900
Killed in front of the school,
10:00 at night.

99
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,000
Last to see was
Margaret Trudlow,

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,500
another teacher, hours earlier.

101
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,100
She was in Teach for America.

102
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,300
A cousin of mine did that.

103
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,300
It's like the Peace Corps.

104
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,200
Grads spend a couple of years
in the worst public schools.

105
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,300
It takes guts doing that.

106
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,700
Or a loose screw.

107
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,500
Sometimes those are
the best teachers.

108
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,400
Always that one
you remember, right ?

109
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,300
Shot once in the back with a .22.

110
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,200
Doer left the shell casing.

111
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,900
Not to mention the car.

112
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,500
She's found just steps
from her vehicle, but no keys.

113
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,500
Witnesses ?

114
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
We got a Mrs. Harris.

115
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,400
Lived across from the school.

116
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,900
Sees a black man fleeing the scene.

117
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,200
Reeves High School
security guard was closer.

118
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,700
Carlton Rawls eyeballs the doer

119
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:20,701
standing over Laura's body
and chases him off.

120
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,500
Our hero, almost.

121
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,800
But neither witness
saw the doer pull the trigger.

122
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
Let alone the gun.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,400
Victim's father coming in ?

124
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,000
Taking the train
from New York.

125
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,300
He still blames himself
for getting her the car.

126
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,800
If I'd had a kid
go teach at that school,

127
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,400
I'd a given 'em a .38.

128
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,100
'91 was a record year
for homicides.

129
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,400
501.

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,700
Original detectives
were overworked.

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,400
Witness testimony,
placement of the body,

132
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,900
they focused on the robbery angle.

133
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,300
Leaving out the personal.

134
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,900
Maybe connected to the school.

135
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,100
<i>Great, thank you.</i>

136
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,300
Second eyewitness,
old Mrs. Harris.

137
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,000
Says she'd love to meet,
talk about what she saw.

138
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,600
Only not today,
her dog's getting groomed.

139
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,100
And tomorrow's book club.

140
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,500
Ah, playing hard to get.

141
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,600
Lives in Camden.

142
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Figured I'd swing by,
pay her a visit.

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,400
Anybody up for a drive ?

144
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,200
Taking that as a "no."

145
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,900
Heading down to Ballistics
about the murder weapon.

146
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,500
IBIS database didn't exist in '91.

147
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,400
Could be useful now.

148
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Gun's out there 17 years, Nick.

149
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,700
Any luck, it was used
in another crime.

150
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
"Luck" ?

151
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,600
You know what I mean.

152
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Nick.

153
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,900
They got ties, three for ten
bucks on the corner over there.

154
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,300
You might want to take a look.

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
I wouldn't let her
take the subway.

156
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,300
"It's too dangerous," I said.

157
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,100
We're looking at the possibility

158
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:02,001
this wasn't about Laura's car.

159
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,200
She ever mention
any personal problems ?

160
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,700
I talked to her on the phone
at least twice a week.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,500
Far as I could tell,
her life was work and home.

162
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,700
No guys in the picture ?

163
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,200
Not that I knew of.

164
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,200
That job completely consumed her.

165
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,100
She stay late,

166
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,000
- after school ?
- All the time.

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,400
She believed in the program.

168
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,200
You didn't ?

169
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,400
Well, they sent her out
full of big ideas.

170
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,700
How she'd make her mark.

171
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,700
Didn't tell her that
no one else was on board.

172
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,300
This place is a disaster area.

173
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Dad...

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,700
We've got reservations in
half an hour. Did you forget?

175
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,000
I know it's bad here.

176
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,200
I'm going to
paint my classroom next.

177
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,500
Plant some flowers in the spring.

178
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,100
Give it a sense of hope.

179
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,100
You okay, baby ?

180
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,500
These kids, they can barely read,

181
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,900
let alone write.

182
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,100
I can't control them.

183
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,700
They won't even listen to me.

184
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
- You're doing your best.
- Look at me.

185
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,400
No matter how much
extra effort I put in,

186
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,200
I still can't get through.

187
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,500
Hey, listen,

188
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,900
when I started out,
working legal aid in Newark,

189
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,300
I stunk at my job.

190
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,200
I couldn't win a case.

191
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,800
One day an older lawyer
pulled me aside.

192
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,000
Told me, "Forget about the facts."

193
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,000
"Just tell the jury a story."

194
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,600
"A story."

195
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,800
Isn't that what
history's all about ?

196
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,500
Come on, look.

197
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,800
Don't kill yourself.

198
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,700
A job shouldn't do this to you.

199
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,700
This is more than
a job to me, dad.

200
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,500
I made a commitment.

201
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm gonna see it through.

202
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:56,601
<i>"Here's where the story ends."
by The Sundays.</i>

203
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,400
That was Laura.

204
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,200
Determined to make a difference.

205
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,800
I don't know if she
even got the chance.

206
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,100
I think she did, Mr. McKinney.

207
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,600
It was one of her students
who brought these in.

208
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,300
Remembered her all this time.

209
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,300
The teachers she worked with...

210
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,200
She ever mention any of them?

211
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,900
I don't think they went
out of their way to welcome her.

212
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,000
Why's that?

213
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Laura did the same job
for less money.

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,600
Guess they perceived
the program as a threat.

215
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Any teachers give Laura
a particularly hard time?

216
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,700
A woman with a class
next door, Margaret.

217
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,300
Supposed to be her mentor.

218
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Sounded more like a menace.

219
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,600
How you doing, Carla ?

220
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,300
I got a cold one needs
running through IBIS ASAP.

221
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,600
- Two weeks.
- It's kind of important.

222
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Aren't they all ?

223
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
I hear you.

224
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,400
I'm talking special circumstances.

225
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,600
The victim was a teacher,
you know what I mean ?

226
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Remember your favorite teacher?
Imagine if she got killed.

227
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,400
I hated my teachers.

228
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,500
Look, we need to expedite this.

229
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,900
Any other forms to fill out?

230
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,100
No other forms,
no exceptions.

231
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,300
Fresh jobs get priority.

232
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,900
Take a number.
Come back in two weeks.

233
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,100
Okay ? Okay.

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
Only thing I remember from that night

235
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,600
is I left at 5:00 p.m. sharp,

236
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,900
and Laura was still
in her classroom, as usual.

237
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,900
Here's your list of students.

238
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,600
I highlighted the troubled ones.

239
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,400
A lot of names.

240
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,100
Only the best and brightest.

241
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Perk of the public
school system.

242
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,800
Well, uh,

243
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,600
how'd you get along
with Laura ?

244
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,300
Miss McKinney was nice enough.

245
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,800
Here every night till 10:00,

246
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:53,001
grading papers,
doing lesson plans.

247
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,000
That's a good teacher.

248
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,500
I didn't say that.

249
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,400
Try sitting up straight.

250
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,200
Way we heard it, you had
it in for Laura from day one.

251
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,000
How would you like it

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,300
if some kid straight out of school
came in to the police department

253
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,800
thinking they had
all the answers ?

254
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,800
She thought this was
some kind of mission.

255
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,700
But she didn't have the training
or the requisite skills.

256
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,400
Such as ?

257
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,300
She couldn't even
control her classroom.

258
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,200
It's sink or swim,
and Laura was drowning.

259
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Sounded like World War III.

260
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,100
I come in.

261
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,400
Everybody's up out of their seats,

262
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,100
and she's just
standing there, helpless.

263
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,600
Come on, Margaret.

264
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,500
She's not that bad.

265
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
She won't make it till Christmas.

266
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,600
I was hoping to talk to you
about these textbooks.

267
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,800
What about them?

268
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,300
There aren't enough of them.

269
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I went to the principal.

270
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,700
he said I couldn't order new materials
until Christmas break.

271
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,400
What's the joke ?

272
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
If you last that long,

273
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,500
you can ask Santa
for the extra books.

274
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:06,201
<i>"Where is my mind ?"
by The Pixies.</i>

275
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,800
Teaching's about more
than a winning smile.

276
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,100
She wasn't cut out for it.

277
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,600
The guy who stuck up for Laura--

278
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,500
- he liked her ?
- Kenny Yates.

279
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,300
He didn't have to share
a wall with her.

280
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
He still teach here ?

281
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,200
Left for greener pastures.

282
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,300
Parochial school.

283
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,200
Less money, more respect.

284
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,600
This is a dangerous place, huh ?

285
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,000
Pepper spray ?

286
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,900
Need some kind of protection if
you're gonna last as long as I have.

287
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,800
Laura didn't have her keys
the night she was killed.

288
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,300
- Figures.
- What happens,

289
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,500
situation like that?

290
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
Late at night,
no one else around.

291
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,800
You go to the security guard.

292
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Always on post at
the front entrance.

293
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,800
Back in '91,
it's a Carlton Rawls ?

294
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,100
He was our last
line of defense.

295
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,700
Thanks for meeting us, Carlton.

296
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,200
No sweat.

297
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,000
Working security across town.

298
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,600
They're cool with me being here,
being first responder and all.

299
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,300
Walk us through
what you remember.

300
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,100
I was at my post,

301
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,300
just inside here.

302
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,800
Shot rang out,
I'm through the door.

303
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,300
She was right here
on the street.

304
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,100
Number one male
standing over her.

305
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,800
He figured he was
taking her car.

306
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,700
He thought different
when he saw me rushing him.

307
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,700
He busted ass the other way.

308
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,500
A compelling story, Carlton.

309
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,900
What ?

310
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,100
That's what happened.

311
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,000
See, Carlton,
we got the other witness,

312
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,400
saw the suspect running past
her apartment window that way.

313
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,400
That means the suspect
would've been running toward you,

314
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,100
not away.
Right ?

315
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,600
You weren't at your post.

316
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,800
Where were you ?

317
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,600
- I'm telling you, I...
- No, see, you're lying.

318
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,200
You keep it up, we're gonna
start thinking bad things.

319
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,600
I was in the parking lot.

320
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,900
- My car.
- Sleeping one off ?

321
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,000
I smell the whiskey
on your breath.

322
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,000
You see the gun, Carlton ?

323
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,300
Suspect's face?

324
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,000
Hey, you see anything ?

325
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Guy running away down the block.

326
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,200
Look, I had my eye out,
even from the car.

327
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,900
Every door in the school was padlocked
from the inside except for two.

328
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,700
Which ones ?

329
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,900
The one to the parking lot--

330
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,100
which is where I was

331
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,200
and where Laura should've come
if she was going to her car.

332
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,000
She didn't have
her keys, Carlton.

333
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,300
Say she wasn't going to her car.

334
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,400
She still would've come out
through the parking lot.

335
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,800
And I'd have been there.

336
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,800
Why ?

337
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,100
What's this other door ?

338
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,400
Back alley where the garbage goes.

339
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Told her time and time
again not to use this door.

340
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,600
Locks automatically
when you go out.

341
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,900
Figure she was in trouble inside.

342
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,300
You weren't at your post.

343
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,600
Probably she was looking for you.

344
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,900
Don't know why she didn't listen.

345
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,700
Knew it was bad out here.

346
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Maybe something inside
was worse.

347
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,600
Understand you
looked out for Laura.

348
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,300
She was a kid
out of her element.

349
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,900
Came to me for advice.

350
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,600
You two close ?

351
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,300
Work buddies.

352
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,200
Sorry. Nasty habit.

353
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,000
Can't think straight without it.

354
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,200
Quit recent?

355
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,900
Yeah, five years ago.

356
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,400
Off again, on again, kind of thing.

357
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
You know, Margaret Trudlow said

358
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,300
that Laura was having difficulty
with her students.

359
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,300
Left her to fend for herself.

360
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Laura did the best she could.

361
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,500
How'd the students feel
about Laura's best ?

362
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,500
This school was a glorified
detention facility.

363
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,500
It was endearing how naive
she was about the kids' potential.

364
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,000
Textbook's outdated.

365
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,500
We don't have enough of them.

366
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,700
The copies that we do
have are falling apart.

367
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,100
No wonder the kids don't care.

368
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,400
Welcome to Reeves.

369
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,800
Look, at least now you have
control of your students.

370
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,600
Getting them to sit down
and be quiet isn't teaching.

371
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You've taught here ten years.

372
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How do you do it ?

373
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Simple.

374
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,100
Concentrate on the students
who do care,

375
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
if you could find one.

376
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,800
Just forget the rest.

377
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,300
Forget them ?

378
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,100
What ?

379
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,700
What are you doing ?

380
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,400
Take your seats.

381
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,200
Textbooks out.

382
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,800
Now toss them on the floor.

383
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,000
Come on. We don't have all day.

384
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,000
Great. Darnell,

385
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,300
will you pass these out for me ?

386
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,600
One to each student.

387
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
History is not just
something from the past.

388
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,300
It's a story,

389
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,300
happening every day.

390
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,800
Each of you will pick
a story out of the paper.

391
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,400
We'll read it and discuss
what it means to us,

392
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,600
and to the rest of the world.

393
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,800
We get to keep these ?

394
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,500
Yes.

395
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,500
What's the problem ?

396
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,500
Bitch thinks she can
buy us for 35 cents.

397
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,600
Out, Renaldo.

398
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,000
Now.

399
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:41,801
<i>"Quiet on the set"
by N.W.A.</i>

400
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,600
No matter how hard you try,

401
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,400
there's gonna be the bad apples.

402
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,900
Got any names ?

403
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,500
Too many to remember.

404
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Reason I got out.

405
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,200
Bad for the health.

406
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,800
Nothing changes
if nothing changes.

407
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,800
Been chasing our witness
Mrs. Harris all over Camden.

408
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,900
Neighbor says she plays bingo,

409
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,800
but won't say where without
a faxed request on police letterhead.

410
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,200
Damn !

411
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,000
When you do get her,

412
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,200
have her look through
old Reeves High yearbooks.

413
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,300
You got a suspect ?

414
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,100
Finally.

415
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,900
Kid in Laura's class
named Renaldo Ramos.

416
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,500
Got expelled a few
weeks after her murder

417
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,900
for stealing from
the teachers' lounge.

418
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,200
Rap sheet's an inch thick.

419
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,000
You locate him ?

420
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,000
Not yet.

421
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Brought in the mother
to fill in the blanks.

422
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,700
Course it'd help if we had
some information on the murder weapon.

423
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Not my fault.

424
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,100
Lab rat Carla's
gumming up the works.

425
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,900
Thinking maybe
the boss can call in.

426
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,700
Chain of command's
fine for other cops,

427
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,800
but civilians
don't respect rank.

428
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,300
You got a better idea?

429
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,800
Two words: baked goods.

430
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,200
I'm saying Renaldo
ain't been around.

431
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,000
You told me.

432
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,100
- No address, no phone.
- He's a grown man.

433
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,400
He don't share
nothing with me.

434
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,700
Well, we got
some questions for him.

435
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,800
About that teacher;
this one already told me.

436
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,000
School says you filed a
"discrimination" complaint against her.

437
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,500
Woman had it out for my boy.

438
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,900
Keeping him after
school for detention.

439
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,600
Had the nerve to bring me in
tell me Renaldo's got problems.

440
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Like with attitude ?

441
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,000
Some kind of learning disability.

442
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,500
Wanted him to take
all this testing.

443
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,000
Where's the discrimination ?

444
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,500
Ten years in the school system,

445
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
no one ever say
boo about my kid.

446
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,700
All of a sudden,
there's disabilities.

447
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,200
'Cause Laura was trying to help.

448
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,200
I'm not heartless,you know.

449
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,300
Woman didn't deserve to die.

450
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,000
Just should've minded
her own business.

451
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,100
Mind letting Renaldo know
we'd like to talk to him ?

452
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,000
I told you he ain't been around.

453
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:47,201
Several times.

454
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,900
Just in case.

455
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,700
You buying this ?

456
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,300
Renaldo not being around ?

457
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,000
Me neither.

458
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,900
Fresh scones. Assorted flavors.

459
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,100
A little "thank you"
for all your hard work.

460
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,700
Looking to kill me ?

461
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,200
I have celiac disease.

462
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,800
I'm allergic to wheat.

463
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,900
Uh, Carla,

464
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,100
I'm trying to play ball here.

465
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,600
I need that ballistics report.

466
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,500
I'm begging you.

467
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
What's it gonna take ?

468
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,900
I like musicals.

469
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,000
Thanks for coming
back in, Darnell.

470
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,800
Wondering if you remember
a kid from school,

471
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,200
- Renaldo Ramos ?
- Renaldo Ramos.

472
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,300
Haven't heard that
name in a while.

473
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,900
He's in jail, right ?

474
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,500
In and out.

475
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,300
You ever hear about him
bringing a gun to school ?

476
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,200
You think he killed
Miss McKinney ?

477
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,800
We know he had problems with her.

478
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
The other teachers
had given up on him.

479
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,000
Miss McKinney tried to take
him on as a sort of project,

480
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
but he made it hard.

481
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,500
You ever hear him threaten her ?

482
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,800
No, but it wouldn't surprise me.

483
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,000
He was already half a thug,
even then.

484
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You're late, Renaldo.

485
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,200
Go inside. Take out
your workbook.

486
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,300
- I'll be in there soon.
- Forgot it.

487
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,100
Again ? How is that possible ?

488
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,000
No workbook, no pen, no paper.

489
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,700
- I mean, what do you even keep in here ?
- Give that back.

490
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,500
I am trying to work
with you, but I can't...

491
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,400
- What is this ? Drugs ?
- That's not mine.

492
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,900
What's up ?

493
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,900
Renaldo giving you
a hard time ?

494
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,200
It's fine. I got it covered.

495
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,100
- When did this happen?
- I don't know.

496
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,600
A few weeks before
Miss McKinney died ?

497
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,800
Never thought to mention it ?

498
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,300
At Reeves, stuff like that was
the rule, not the exception.

499
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,300
Miss McKinney said she
had it under control.

500
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,300
Renaldo must have
loved growing up here.

501
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,800
From: Saccardo
Nice Mug !!!

502
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,100
- That from Saccardo ?
- Yeah.

503
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,000
What's up with
those boots of his ?

504
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,800
What do you mean?

505
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,000
Sayin'.

506
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,400
He's in Narcotics.

507
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,100
It's their thing.

508
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,700
I was in Narcotics.

509
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,200
Never wore Timberlands.

510
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,200
Pay dirt, five o'clock.

511
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,300
Renaldo Ramos ?

512
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
What happened ?!
What you do to him ?!

513
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,100
What did you do to my boy ?!

514
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,600
- Hey Look.
- He's fine, Ma.

515
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,500
Thanks for your help.

516
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,800
Hell of a sheet, Renaldo.

517
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,300
Assault, robbery, auto theft.

518
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,400
Even back at Reeves High.

519
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,100
Stealing from the teachers' lounge.

520
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,200
That wasn't me.

521
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,500
Prison, parole, prison again.

522
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,900
Maybe crime isn't your thing.

523
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,800
Yeah, like those drugs, Renaldo.

524
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,700
The ones Laura McKinney
found in your backpack.

525
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,800
You and Miss McKinney
didn't get along.

526
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,600
Always singling you out.

527
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,700
Oh, I get it.

528
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,700
Had this one teacher,
Sister Beatrice.

529
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,900
Chew gum in class.

530
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,000
Thwap! Instant retribution.

531
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,200
That how Miss McKinney was,
tough on you, Renaldo ?

532
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,000
She was cool.

533
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,500
How's that ?

534
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,900
Could have narc'd me out.

535
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,200
Just kicked me back
to the rejects class.

536
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,000
That's because
you threatened her ?

537
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,700
Let her know what would happen
if you turned her in ?

538
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,600
I was dying
to get out of school,

539
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,800
but that lady
just wouldn't let go.

540
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,100
Getting on your case,
bringing your moms down on you.

541
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,500
No, man. She was different
from other teachers.

542
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Like she expected something.
In a good way.

543
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,700
Kind of made school okay.

544
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:12,101
<i>"Crazy" by Seal.</i>

545
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,600
What is it ?

546
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,800
What do you think it is ?

547
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,000
Stupid.

548
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,900
You could go back
to the bus, Renaldo.

549
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,400
Is that what you want ?

550
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,700
It's just an empty lot, Miss.

551
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,700
That's what it is now,
but not always.

552
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,300
200 years ago,

553
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,300
They brought slaves here.

554
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,900
Auctioned on this
very spot, only a mile

555
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,900
from where the Declaration
of Independence was signed.

556
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Hey, wake up !

557
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,400
Okay, this is important.

558
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,700
We're not talking books.

559
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,500
We're talking living,
breathing history.

560
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Something that matters.

561
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,500
We live in one of the most
historic cities in the country.

562
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,500
Everywhere you go,
the past lives.

563
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,000
You just got to find it.

564
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,000
This is your assignment.

565
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,700
I want you to go back
to your neighborhood

566
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,600
and find something of
historical significance.

567
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,100
No matter how small,
and write about it.

568
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,200
Get to know
where you're from.

569
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,700
And then you can decide
where you're going.

570
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Now that's a touching story.

571
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,600
I'm sure it made you turn over
a new leaf,

572
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:46,101
graduate with honors.

573
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,600
Don't think I could have?

574
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,500
Where were you the
night Laura was killed ?

575
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,100
At work, flipping burgers.

576
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,400
Answered pretty quick.
Gonna hold up when we check ?

577
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,100
What's it matter ? Huh ?

578
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,400
You already made up
your mind about me.

579
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,100
Set us straight.

580
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,600
You should be looking
at the teacher's pet.

581
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,000
That Darnell Brent.

582
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
For real.

583
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,800
You should have seen the way
that kid was looking at her.

584
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,600
Left her little stuffed animals.

585
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,800
Gifts, right ?

586
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,400
Put 'em there anonymous.

587
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,100
Real romantic.

588
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,900
We're supposed
to believe you 'cause...

589
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,400
Couldn't even graduate high school.

590
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,900
I don't give a damn.

591
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,700
Can I go ?

592
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,300
We'll get you a toothbrush.

593
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,700
You're gonna be here a while.

594
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Little confused here, Darnell.

595
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,400
You're the one who
brought this case in.

596
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,800
Figured you wanted it closed.

597
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,200
Of course I do.

598
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,400
You and Miss McKinney...
pretty tight ?

599
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,000
But it was more
than teacher-student.

600
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,300
What do you mean ?

601
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,400
You had feelings for her, right ?

602
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Leaving all those stuffed
animals for her on the sly.

603
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,900
Staying after school,
just you and her.

604
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,900
Maybe...

605
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,600
Messages get mixed.

606
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,900
Wasn't that much older.

607
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,100
Happens to the best of us.

608
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,800
I was 15.

609
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,300
Thought I was in love.

610
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,500
That's terrific, Darnell.

611
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,400
Now this is a thesis statement.

612
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,500
Do you see the difference ?

613
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,000
Darnell, what are you doing ?

614
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,600
She told me not
to worry about it, but...

615
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,900
She made sure we were never
alone in the same room again.

616
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,700
- Must have been humiliating.
- Yeah.

617
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,800
But I'm a teacher now,

618
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,600
and I understand her dilemma.

619
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,900
You want to get close
to your students.

620
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,300
- But not too close.
- Yeah.

621
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,800
This is kidnapping, you know.

622
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,200
Sorry you seit that way, ma'am.

623
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,800
Luring me out of my own church
on bingo day ?

624
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,900
- Should be ashamed,young man.
- Yes, ma'am.

625
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,400
Why don't you step
into the kitchen ?

626
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,800
I'll be with you in a moment,
show you some pictures.

627
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,300
The old rope-a-dope ?

628
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,100
Told her I saw someone hit her car
in the church parking lot.

629
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,100
She comes out...

630
00:29:06,101 --> 00:29:07,801
You persuade her to take a ride.

631
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,500
Detective Jeffries ?

632
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,200
Would it kill you to
offer me some refreshment ?

633
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,300
Ballistics report on the 22
that killed Laura McKinney.

634
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,800
This cost me big.

635
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,900
Two tickets to Wicked and dinner.

636
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,700
I need you to appreciate that.

637
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,500
You're my hero.

638
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,100
Murder weapon has
a sordid history.

639
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,400
Recovered by police seven
years ago, liquor store robbery.

640
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,100
Well, suspect in possession
said he found the gun.

641
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,300
Alibi'd out for the murder.

642
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,600
I traced the serial number.

643
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,600
The original owner was
a cab driver, Nigerian guy.

644
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,800
Kid happened to go to Reeves High.

645
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:48,201
In '91.

646
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,100
Kid gets bullied.

647
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,700
Takes Pop's gun to school.

648
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,800
Confiscated by a security guard.

649
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,200
Guess who.

650
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,400
I've met some low-IQ jackasses in
my career, but you take the prize.

651
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,100
How stupid you got to be.

652
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,800
Take a gun off a kid,
not turn it in?

653
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,300
Or was there another reason ?

654
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Between you and me,
I heard

655
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,700
Laura was a knockout.

656
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,000
You have a thing for her ?

657
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,200
- It wasn't like that.
- Even some students wanted a piece,

658
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,600
but you think,

659
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,600
an authority figure
like myself--I got a shot.

660
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,300
And after some liquid
courage, you make a move.

661
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,800
- She turns you down.
- No way.

662
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,600
We got you at the
crime scene, Carlton.

663
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,500
Got you with the gun.
You're done.

664
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,800
- Already typed up my report.
- I liked those teachers.

665
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,200
Looked after 'em
the best I could.

666
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,400
That's why I kept the gun.

667
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,300
Someone needed it.

668
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,100
Why'd she need it, Carlton ?

669
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,800
I didn't ask.

670
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,300
She was a good woman.

671
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,400
If she said she needed
the gun, she needed it.

672
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,800
I was just trying to help.

673
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,300
That's my job.

674
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,300
It's time to find a
different line of work.

675
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,600
Don't bother standing.

676
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,200
What are you doing ?

677
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,600
Well, seeing if you're packing.

678
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Or are the new security guards
more accommodating than Carlton?

679
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,600
You have some kind of
grudge against Laura ?

680
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,300
Younger, prettier,
better at her job.

681
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,800
That gun had nothing
to do with Laura.

682
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,200
Then what was it for,
Margaret ?

683
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,600
Protection.

684
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,600
After 20 years in this war zone,
I got attacked.

685
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,400
Former students.

686
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,600
I could never feel safe again.

687
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,700
So you went to Carlton ?

688
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,300
I never felt comfortable
having that gun.

689
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,500
Then one day,my purse was
stolen from the teachers' lounge.

690
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,600
And this happened
before Laura was killed ?

691
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,300
So, why didn't you report it ?

692
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,300
Didn't want to get
Carlton into trouble.

693
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,600
He's a good man.

694
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
A close friend...

695
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,800
at the time.

696
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,200
You meet Will's girlfriend yet ?

697
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,300
No, but I heard her
all the way down the hall.

698
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,800
- Delightful woman.
- He get anything from her ?

699
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,200
Hope so, or he's about to pitch
an old lady out the window.

700
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,300
Back in '91, you said you saw
a black man running from the scene.

701
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,700
This isn't a black man.

702
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,000
Son, you don't think
I know the difference ?

703
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I said a dark-skinned man
came running past my window.

704
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,800
This is the one I saw.

705
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,200
Renaldo Ramos.

706
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,300
Look at you, Renaldo.

707
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,500
32, still living at home,
no kind of job.

708
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,800
Acting like you
got it figured out.

709
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,300
You say so.

710
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,000
You were there the night
Miss McKinney was killed.

711
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,700
You were fed up
with the way she treated you.

712
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,700
You stole Margaret's bag
with the gun in it,

713
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,000
waited for her,then pop!

714
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,700
- I was at my job.
- There was no job.

715
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,800
I didn't do nothing.

716
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,000
We got the old lady
clocking you from her window.

717
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,200
Got 30 witnesses saying

718
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,400
you bragged on all the things
you stole from the teachers' lounge.

719
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,700
It's over.

720
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,900
You're just too dull to know it.

721
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,900
I couldn't have her mad.

722
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,500
So, you went at her.

723
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
No.

724
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,300
She came to me.

725
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,400
Yo.

726
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,200
What you doing here, miss?
This ain't a good neighborhood.

727
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,100
I wanted to see
where the fire was.

728
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,700
What you mean ?

729
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,400
Well, it says six
tenants lost their homes

730
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
to a fire right here in this building

731
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,300
ten years ago.

732
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,700
Long time.

733
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,200
One man made sure
they were all relocated.

734
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,900
Took care of them.

735
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,200
Roberto Jimenez.

736
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,300
It's pretty amazing.

737
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,000
I know your handwriting,Renaldo.

738
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,700
It's the assignment I gave
on the field trip.

739
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,600
He was my grandfather.

740
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,600
It's good. Renaldo.

741
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Like you said, history's
happening everywhere.

742
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Like you coming to Reeves,
making a difference.

743
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,600
You want back in my class ?

744
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,200
You need to use your voice.

745
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,400
If you want in,
I have to hear you say it.

746
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,400
Yeah.

747
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,300
That's what I want.

748
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,500
Okay.

749
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,200
But I need you to come
clean about the drugs.

750
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
But, miss, those weren't my drugs.

751
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,500
- Renaldo...
- I swear to you.

752
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,400
They say I steal, I don't.

753
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,900
They say I deal drugs, I don't.

754
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,100
Everyone's always
saying I'm bad.

755
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,400
I stopped trying
to prove them wrong.

756
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,000
There's always someone else
to blame for your crap life,

757
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,900
your dumb mistakes.

758
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,600
You said tell the truth.
I told you.

759
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,100
Drugs didn't belong to me.

760
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,900
Then, who, Renaldo,
another student ?

761
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,300
A teacher.

762
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,000
It's got to be hard leaving
that school like you did.

763
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,400
Fatigue, right?

764
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,300
Well, the place was impossible.

765
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,600
I had to get out.

766
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,600
But you and I both
know it wasn't fatigue.

767
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,900
"Nothing changes
if nothing changes."

768
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,900
I can spot another
addict a mile away.

769
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,900
Yeah, I... I had a problem.

770
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,200
Almost lost my job over it.

771
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,100
It can be rough.

772
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,400
Yeah, still is.

773
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,800
"Day at a time," right?

774
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,900
How bad a habit ? A gram ?

775
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,200
Two ?

776
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,900
It gets expensive
on a teacher's salary.

777
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,600
I kept it together.

778
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,500
- Yeah ?
- Yeah.

779
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,000
Yeah, me, too.

780
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,100
Until one day
I... I woke up and...

781
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,000
saw the mess I made.

782
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,900
The thing is, then we get better,
and we got to take responsibility.

783
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,200
Hey, we're, uh...

784
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,900
We're only as sick
as our secrets.

785
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,500
Like taking Margaret's bag
from the faculty lounge.

786
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,200
You did that, but the
worst part, Kenny,

787
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,000
And I know you feel this...

788
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
The worst part is using
Renaldo to score for you.

789
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,800
You told Laura all about it,

790
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,200
Kenny making you score for him ?

791
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,800
Should have never
got her involved.

792
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,300
All these years,
why didn't you say something ?

793
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,400
You kidding ?

794
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,800
Take a look.

795
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,200
Who's gonna believe
a thug like me ?

796
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,700
I want to believe you, Renaldo.

797
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,200
I want to be like Laura,see
something different than just a thug,

798
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
but you gotta be straight with me.

799
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,100
I told you everything.

800
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,900
Still haven't told me
why you were at the crime scene.

801
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
It's my fault she's dead.

802
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,400
Why, 'cause something happened ?

803
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,500
She went back to the school.

804
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
To confront Kenny ?

805
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,000
I followed.

806
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,700
Waited outside.

807
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,700
Just wanted to make
sure she was okay.

808
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,800
Laura knew about
you and Renaldo.

809
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,900
Everything was on the line.

810
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,700
If she turned you in,
your life would be ruined.

811
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,600
She just didn't get it,
this is a disease.

812
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,500
I just wanted her to listen.

813
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
You were there that night.

814
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
I...

815
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,300
I needed some time to get
my thoughts together,but...

816
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,900
she wouldn't let up.

817
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,200
You need to resign.

818
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,600
You can do it with dignity.

819
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
I... I won't say a word.

820
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,600
But it has to be done
or I'll turn you in.

821
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,500
How long were you sitting in your
classroom coming up with that speech ?

822
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,900
Laura...

823
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,800
I know this is bad.

824
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,700
It's a problem.

825
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,600
But I'm addressing it.

826
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,800
Address it someplace else,
not around these kids.

827
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,400
See, I'm ahead of you on that.

828
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,800
I already have my eye
on a treatment facility.

829
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,800
This... this
is done... tonight.

830
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,400
- I promise.
- Renaldo is trying

831
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,600
so hard to do things right.

832
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,700
- You are killing him.
- Damn it. Just let me speak.

833
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,400
Will you wipe that smug
look off your face ?

834
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,200
I used to be like you.

835
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,400
I used to feel so
good about teaching.

836
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,000
I believed in the students.

837
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,300
This place beats
the hell out of you.

838
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,400
You'll see.

839
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,900
In five years, you'll be me.

840
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,800
Laura, stop !

841
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,200
Get back here.

842
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,100
I worked there for ten
years, and this kid...

843
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,400
who did she think she was ?

844
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,200
I was a good teacher.

845
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,400
So was Laura.

846
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
How she was special.

847
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,300
Made me want to graduate.

848
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,800
Would have been the
first...in my family.

849
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,200
She went there to defend
me, and I let her down.

850
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,000
I couldn't help.

851
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,700
You can now.

852
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,200
Tell me what you saw.

853
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,800
Hey.

854
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,600
Do it for her.

855
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,900
Miss ?

856
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,300
Miss ?

857
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:04,799
<i>"Half a world away"

* My hand is tired my heart aches *

863

864
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,980
* My head sworn to go it alone *

865
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,250

866
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:54,040

867
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:59,020

868

* My shoes are gone, my life spent *

872
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:20,510
* I had too much to drink. I didn't think *

873
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,640
* And I didn't think of you *

874
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,020

875
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,030

* Haul it along and hold it *

877
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:41,880
* Blackbirds backwards forwards

00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:52,940

882

* It shook the trees *

883
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,860
