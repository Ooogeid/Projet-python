All right, Flanagan,

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:34,963
- Try not to get hurt.
- Okay, coach.

13

Next time, it's your head !

<i>Yet another penalty

00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:19,904
<i>He shoots !</i>

28
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:25,379
<i>No ! That was a scoring

rookie mistake.

33
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:36,626
What the hell were you thinking,
Slap shot that close in ?

34
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:37,761
Get your head in the game !

35
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:39,329
I'm sorry, coach.

36
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:40,596

00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,019
What's his story ?

48
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:27,289
Well, charged
for a murder in 1980.

49
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:29,157
A hockey player
named Tommy Flanagan,

50
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:31,192
played for the
Fishtown Dock Rats.

51
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,459
Killed on the ice.

52
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,094
"Opposing defenseman,
booted out of the game,

53
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:35,594
threatens to kill the kid
in front of witnesses."

54
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:38,196
Yeah, Tommy's blood on
his jersey, no alibi.

55
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:41,464
Arrested him,
but the DA dropped charges.

56
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,929
So what, is he here to confess ?

57
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:48,665
Skated on this murder
once already.

58
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:51,201
You sure you want
to try your luck again ?

59
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:52,704
Night the U.S. hockey team

60
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,305
beats the russians in the olympics,

61
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:57,241
"miracle on ice",
my life goes to hell.

62
00:02:57,309 --> 00:02:58,542
February 22,

63
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,177
the night Tommy was killed ?

64
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:01,713
Punk on a rival team
kept getting in my face.

65
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,148
He was five, five, a buck-fifty.

66
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:05,616
You outweighed him by what,
70 pounds ?

67
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:07,217
The kid didn't know
when to quit.

68
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:09,687
You're not making much of a case
for your innocence here.

69
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:12,355
Tommy got me kicked
out of the game that day.

70
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:14,158
I made a few threats.

71
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:16,693
You said you were gonna cave
his head in.

72
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:18,928
Pretty specific.

73
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:24,233
That night the U.S. Won,

74
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,301
hockey players were like gods.

75
00:03:26,369 --> 00:03:27,835
Women were going nuts.

76
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:29,138
Even a goon like me.

77
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:30,539
Saying you got lucky ?

78
00:03:30,606 --> 00:03:32,106
College girl from Spokane.

79
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:33,841
Brenda something.

80
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:36,043
Spent the night
in the back of her pinto.

81
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:38,479
Next morning, she splits.

82
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:39,747
Tommy turns up dead.

83
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:41,982
And you're on the hook
for murder.

84
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,818
Never went to trial,
but it didn't matter.

85
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:45,787
Everybody was sure it was me,

86
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:48,122
wouldn't let me live it down.

87
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:52,159
Look, I messed
a lot of things up.

88
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:55,063
This is the only thing
I ever did right,

89
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,465
my boy, Jason.

90
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,100
He's 11 now.

91
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:00,735
Wants to play hockey.

92
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:02,070
I sign him up.

93
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:03,905
Junior league asked me to leave.

94
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:06,707
Won't let him play 'cause
of what they say I did.

95
00:04:06,975 --> 00:04:08,475
It broke his heart.

96
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:10,210
Well, there's always soccer.

97
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:13,145
Sad kid Ain't reason enough

98
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:14,646
to reopen a murder case.

99
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:16,749
I kept searching for the girl
from that night.

100
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:19,484
Internet, even hired a PI.

101
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:21,118
This "backseat Brenda"?

102
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:23,653
Lives in Maine.
Married, got kids.

103
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,956
Not too happy
about the phone call,

104
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:27,890
But she'll vouch for me
for that night.

105
00:04:29,258 --> 00:04:30,992
Brenda Patterson.

106
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,426
Look at the file.

107
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:35,228
Pull the record.
Wasn't my stick killed him.

108
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,796
Whoever took Tommy Flanagan's life,

109
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:39,331
is still out there.

110
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,969
You find him, maybe my son

111
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:45,737
gets to believe
in his dad again.

112
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:53,775
Cold Case
Season 7 Episode 10

113
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:19,136
Iced

114
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:32,471
Checked on masters' story
with Brenda from Bangor.

115
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:34,439
Confirmed his alibi.

116
00:05:34,707 --> 00:05:36,607
Still trying to shake the image
of that man

117
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,008
in the backseat of a Pinto.

118
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:39,042
So's she.

119
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,243
Country was taking it
on the chin in '80 :

120
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:43,878
Hostages in Iran,
soviets in Afghanistan,

121
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:45,146
double-digit inflation.

122
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,616
And then there was
"Miracle on ice".

123
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,250
David takes on Goliath,
and we come out with a win.

124
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,552
We sent amateur kids,
they sent pros.

125
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,487
Country got some
of its pride back.

126
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:58,455
Yeah, minor leagues
like the one Tommy was in,

127
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:00,657
Came and went
in the '70s and '80s.

128
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:02,292
A rough trade.
Aggressive hockey,

129
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,827
lots of fights.

130
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:05,563
This kid a little small
for that bunch ?

131
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,432
Little guys scrap
until they're hamburger.

132
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,767
Dougie Gilmour,

133
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,868
Theo fleury
in the punch-up in Piestany.

134
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:13,369
Nigel Dawes.

135
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:15,670
Rangers ? Screw that guy.

136
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:17,338
What'd the DA's office
have to say

137
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:19,040
about dropping
the case in '80 ?

138
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:22,710
Evidence against Masters
was circumstantial, hearsay.

139
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:24,145
36 hours in interrogation,

140
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:25,746
guy wouldn't crack.

141
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:27,214
Needed a confession
on a case like this

142
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:28,549
and they weren't getting it.

143
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:29,917
This murder happened late.

144
00:06:29,985 --> 00:06:31,585
After the olympic game.

145
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:33,254
What's this kid doing
at the rink that hour ?

146
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:35,025
Somebody had to have access,
let him in.

147
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,364
Coach, janitors, zamboni guy.

148
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:39,767
Let's talk to them again,
see if their stories

149
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:41,202
Still hold up, find out
who else could've had a key.

150
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,407
Took his first hit in front
of the players' bench,

151
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:45,312
shattered the stick.

152
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,417
Couldn't get a clean print
off the murder weapon.

153
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:52,323
Sverre...
Brand's norwegian.

154
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:53,891
Nice gear.

155
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,924
That's a customized hand-carved
piece of wood.

156
00:06:55,992 --> 00:06:57,792
Masters said
it wasn't his stick.

157
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,693
Cops never figured out
whose it was.

158
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:00,894
I'll run it through CSU.

159
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,161
See if we can get DNA.

160
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,363
Well, Tommy's older brother, Sean,

161
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:06,432
was pretty hot at Masters
after he got off.

162
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,801
- Hassled him for months.
- Let's talk to him first.

163
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:10,068
See what he knows
about this number.

164
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:13,905
Rangers.

165
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:15,740
So, um...

166
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:17,341
You find out about this weekend ?

167
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:20,242
Yeah, Veronica's
got a thing at school.

168
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,910
What about Tuesday ?

169
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:23,310
Cle review.

170
00:07:23,378 --> 00:07:24,946
I think I'm supposed
to teach it.

171
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:26,115
I'll try to cancel.

172
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:27,221
No.

173
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:29,722
I can try to get a sitter.

174
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:31,290
Maybe Thursday ?

175
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:33,592
My favorite day.

176
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,629
Pick me up at 8:00.

177
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:38,434
Trying to tell me

178
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:41,239
That meathead son of a bitch
wasn't the one who killed him ?

179
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:43,906
Just asking if you know anybody
else had it in for Ttommy ?

180
00:07:43,974 --> 00:07:45,842
Me and my brother
weren't real close.

181
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,779
We ran in different circles,
you know ?

182
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:51,549
This is the stick
that killed your brother.

183
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:53,184
Recognize it ?

184
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,685
No.

185
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:58,688
Asked me that back in '80.

186
00:07:58,756 --> 00:08:00,089
It's, uh, high-end stuff.

187
00:08:00,157 --> 00:08:03,059
It's got a really nice
curve at the toe.

188
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:06,061
- Sound like you know the game.
- Played center in high school.

189
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:08,296
Got blindsided on a motorcycle

190
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:11,164
and messed my leg up
and that was that.

191
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:12,999
Ma was sick.

192
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:15,334
Tommy was kind
of a layabout.

193
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:18,103
So someone had
to pick up the slack.

194
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:19,904
So how'd Tommy get into playing ?

195
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:21,872
Economy's in the crapper
and no jobs.

196
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,574
Local leagues'd spring up,

197
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:26,743
Started tossing pennies
to anyone who'd take a hit.

198
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,178
Fight club on skates.

199
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:29,613
Tommy wasn't really cut out for it.

200
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:31,214
I tried to warn him, but...

201
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:36,582
<i>"Her strut" by Bob Seger.</i>

202
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:42,558
Try this.

203
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,095
Good, right ?

204
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,697
Chicks love the sugar.

205
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,898
They can't taste the alcohol,

206
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,867
till "bam", it just hits 'em.

207
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:57,668
I don't know.

208
00:08:58,136 --> 00:08:59,736
I mean, what do I say ?

209
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:01,939
Don't gotta say nothing,
that's the beauty of it.

210
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:04,507
Listen, all else fails.

211
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:06,041
Pick up a case of schenkers,

212
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,143
Get enough of that
Schuylkill swill in 'em,

213
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:09,812
they can't say no.

214
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,747
You are sick, you know that ?

215
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:13,014
Will you two marys

216
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:14,583
keep your voices down ?

217
00:09:14,651 --> 00:09:16,484
You're gonna wake up ma.

218
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:18,486
Tell him, LT.

219
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:23,524
Dock rats are holding open
tryouts Tuesday.

220
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:25,326
Little Tommy's gonna
get on the ice.

221
00:09:25,393 --> 00:09:26,860
Now, get serious, Tommy.

222
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:28,328
What're you gonna
hit them with, huh ?

223
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:29,496
Elfin magic ?

224
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:33,167
That's better than just giving up
like you did.

225
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:37,071
Are you trying to be funny ?

226
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:40,342
Look at you... a love tap

227
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,477
like that puts you on your ass,

228
00:09:42,545 --> 00:09:44,778
But you're gonna go play league
hockey with these animals ?

229
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:47,447
Dock rats is no place for you.

230
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:50,015
It's just a goon squad
looking for cannon fodder

231
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,050
to draw penalties.

232
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:53,151
You're too little, bro.

233
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,886
So hit me again, sean.

234
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:58,355
You know I can take anything
you dish out.

235
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:00,390
'cause I'm still a Flanagan.

236
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,761
I don't know what got into him,
but he took it real serious.

237
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:08,063
Any idea what he was doing
on the ice that night ?

238
00:10:08,231 --> 00:10:09,865
I don't know...
Practicing, maybe.

239
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:11,766
How'd he get into the rink
that late ?

240
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:13,967
Tommy's idiot friend, Dwight.

241
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:15,603
Two of them were
a regular frick and frack.

242
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:17,471
Dwight had a key made

243
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:20,073
so he could play asteroids
in the lobby all night.

244
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,508
He try out for
the Dock Rats, too ?

245
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:23,509
Dwight ? Please.

246
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:25,644
Ma on her deathbed
ran a quicker 40.

247
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,346
Closest he ever got was

248
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:29,481
dealing pot to the team.

249
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,090
Hey, buddy !

250
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:41,091
You want to pay for that
thing now that you got

251
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,826
the pages all sticky ?

252
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:45,562
Magazine racket
ain't what it used to be, huh ?

253
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:47,030
The frickin' internet.

254
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:49,932
Everybody thinks they can
get their jollies for free.

255
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,600
Well, what can I do for you,
blue eyes ?

256
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:54,236
Tommy Flanagan.

257
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:55,703
Remember him ?

258
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:57,405
Sure, Tommy was my boy.

259
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:59,073
Buds since the third grade.

260
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:03,343
Lost my best friend the night
that Masters tool took him out.

261
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:04,779
And where were you ?

262
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:06,146
Driving a snowplow.

263
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:08,047
There was a big storm
that night.

264
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,716
I was clearing
parking lots till dawn.

265
00:11:10,884 --> 00:11:13,252
Anybody else come to mind
have a beef with Tommy ?

266
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:14,853
You saying Mmasters didn't do it ?

267
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:16,621
Saying we're looking into it.

268
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,556
Answer the question.

269
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:21,259
Could've been any one
of those guys on the team.

270
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:24,528
My stupid idea, him trying out
for those bunch of thugs.

271
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:27,364
And you'd know--
dealing weed and pills to them.

272
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:30,366
Whoa, wait. You know,
so I did a little business.

273
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:32,335
I mean, come on,
the economy sucked.

274
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:34,271
You had your own key
to the place.

275
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:35,873
Come and go as you pleased.

276
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,141
So did half the team.
Let me tell you something.

277
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:40,676
Those characters
were marginal to begin with.

278
00:11:40,744 --> 00:11:42,345
And everybody likes
an underdog,

279
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:44,447
until he starts making
them look bad.

280
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:47,282
<i>"Rock'n Roll Never Forgets"

281
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,017
Let's go, Tommy !

282
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:52,586
That's my boy out there,
in the blue. See him ?

283
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:55,690
Little Tommy.

284
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,358
The shrimpy guy ?

285
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,994
I thought he was a mascot.

286
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,366
Check out Charlie Hustle.
Scrub with the shiny, new skates.

287
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:08,567
Nice gear, little man !

288
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,040
That necklace
is beautiful.

289
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,108
What is that, lapis ?

290
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:18,043
Matches your eyes.

291
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,979
Say, you two ever
do any modeling ?

292
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,385
Whoops, there they go!

293
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:31,789
Hit him, Tommy !

294
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:39,595
Hey, that's enough !

295
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,531
That's enough !
Come on !

296
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,634
That's enough !

297
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:45,069
That's enough ! Hey ! Hey !

298
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:46,170
You got my attention.

299
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:47,771
Krause, hit the showers.

300
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,272
Hit the showers !

301
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:52,275
Get done,
see me in my office.

302
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:08,488
They all said Little T
pushed to hard.

303
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:10,588
He never knew
when to dial it back.

304
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:13,421
The ass-clown who picked
the fight, he get cut ?

305
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:14,754
Krause.

306
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:17,154
He was too old to be taking
the kind of hits

307
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:18,854
that league dished out.

308
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,686
Always shying away
at the boards.

309
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:22,318
Coach put him out to pasture.

310
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,720
Yeah, and he gave Tommy
his spot on the line.

311
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,121
Krause, you know,

312
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:28,624
He... He asked the coach
for, like, an assistant job,

313
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:31,360
but he had to settle
for equipment manager.

314
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:34,195
So his job to order the sticks
for the team ?

315
00:13:34,263 --> 00:13:35,629
Messed with Tommy's gear, too.

316
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:38,031
Dropped his helmet
in the john one time.

317
00:13:38,398 --> 00:13:40,198
The cops talked to you
back in '80,

318
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:42,334
never thought to mention this ?

319
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:43,669
They never asked.

320
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:46,538
And with a scumbag
like masters on the hook...

321
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:48,140
who's gonna listen ?

322
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:02,069
Ladies are bringing it !

323
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:04,772
Yeah, we got a shot at division II
championship this winter.

324
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,678
Work 'em harder,
see if they want it bad enough.

325
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:08,815
Work harder ?
Sounds like something

326
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,785
Tommy Flanagan might have said.

327
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:14,489
- Kid ever give you trouble, krause ?
- Tommy ? Nah.

328
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:16,094
Way we heard it, he took
your spot on the line

329
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:18,064
after you went to seed.

330
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:20,233
Little guy had no business out there,
but he played hard,

331
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,602
he sucked it up,
left it all on the ice.

332
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:23,636
Sounds like you respected him.

333
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:25,704
- I did.
- That why you dropped

334
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:27,439
a deuce in his helmet
back in '80 ?

335
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:29,373
We all hazed Tommy.

336
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:31,041
It wasn't personal.

337
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:33,610
Recognize this stick ?

338
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:35,845
Yeah. Sverre.

339
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:37,747
Too rich for that bunch
of gorillas.

340
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:39,348
We used koho 310s.

341
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,817
- Ever see tommy with it ?
- Not that I recall.

342
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:44,819
Look... Tommy wasn't
the one we hated.

343
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:47,255
Team had a common enemy :
it was coach Heaton.

347
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,223
Pathetic !

348
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:26,395
Think that weak-ass drill will
hold up against Pittsburgh ?

349
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:28,730
Bunch of murderers...

350
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:31,432
Gonna chew you up
and spit you out.

351
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,637
Flanagan the only one with legs
that can finish that drill ?

352
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:38,039
He's half your size,

353
00:15:38,107 --> 00:15:41,175
but he's got more heart
than any three of you pansies.

354

and waste my time

your a game to the ice !

00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:51,685
Do you hear me ?!

357
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,819
Flanagan !

358
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,356
What the hell are you staring at ?

359
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:01,191
Uh... Nothing, coach.

360
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:02,526
Sorry.

361
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,029
All heart, no skill.

362
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:07,730
All legs, no ability.

363
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,432
You know what that is ?

364
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,868
That's a one-way ticket
to craptown, son.

365
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:15,304
You just earned the team
another round.

366
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:18,374
On your feet !
Again !

367
00:16:25,314 --> 00:16:26,647
Heaton was a sadist.

368
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:28,814
Played guys hurt,
burned them out, no mercy,

369
00:16:28,882 --> 00:16:30,448
Like he got off on it.

370
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:32,482
What about this girl
in the stands ?

371
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,284
Guys called her "jailbait Molly",
coach's daughter.

372
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:36,952
Strictly off limits.

373
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,088
You ever see Tommy and this
jailbait Molly together ?

374
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:42,490
Yeah, once or twice,
chatting it up.

375
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:45,060
Looked kind of cozy to me.

376
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:47,962
Let's go, Julie !

377
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:49,597
Come on ! That's it !

378
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:50,966
Hey.

379
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:51,867
Hey.

380
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:54,801
So, um, I got the sitter

381
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:56,269
for Veronica on Thursday;
we're set.

382
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:59,071
I-I thought you said Tuesday.

383
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:01,239
Thursday.

384
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:03,642
Your favorite day?

385
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,576
Curtis...

386
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:07,544
Let me call my sitter,
maybe switch.

387
00:17:07,812 --> 00:17:09,045
No, it's okay.

388
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:10,679
I'm busy, you're busy.

389
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:14,749
- It's like pulling teeth getting
a few minutes alone. / - Yeah. Hello ?

390
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:16,084
Oh. Hang on.

391
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:17,385
N-no, not you.

392
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,020
No, no, this is a great time.

393
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,491
Sorry.

394
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,126
CSU got nothing off the stick.

395
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:27,181
No DNA other than
Flanagan's blood.

396
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,564
Sverre went out of
business in the '90s;

397
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,590
Composite sticks
started taking over.

398
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:34,111
Hundred-dollar sticks
were big bucks in 1980.

399
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,105
I'm gonna round up
local hockey teams,

400
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:37,706
see who was rocking
custom lumber.

401
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:40,284
Well, Heaton's coaching
the Jacksonville Manatees,

402
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:41,885
an away game in Trenton.

403
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:43,869
Big-time hockey there.

404
00:17:43,894 --> 00:17:44,996
Said he was meeting

405
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,506
with the team owner
the night of Tommy's murder.

406
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:49,818
- Checking it out.
- Well, Rush's got his daughter Molly

407
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:53,004
in the boss's office, gonna see what
she and Tommy had going on.

408
00:17:55,804 --> 00:17:58,592
229 background you filled out...

409
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,278
that's a lot of schools, Molly.

410
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,821
- Move around a lot as a kid ?
- Hockey brat.

411
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:05,924
Dad was always on the road,
from team to team.

412
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:08,293
Stayed in Philly to graduate,
never left.

413
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:09,737
All my friends were here.

414
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:12,257
All your friends,
like Tommy Flanagan ?

415
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,599
What do you mean ?

416
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:16,027
Well, you two, you know...

417
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:17,728
close ?

418
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:20,837
I didn't date hockey players.

419
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:24,435
Well, teammates said you two
were making eyes at the rink.

420
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:26,289
Your father have a problem
with that ?

421
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:30,239
It was fine for him to be out on the road
300 days a year with those idiots,

422
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:33,528
But god forbid one of them
holds the door open for me.

423
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,238
- His way of looking out for you ?
- I don't know.

424
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:38,533
Never was easy to read the guy;
gave up trying.

425
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,201
Think he was hard
on his players ?

426
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,977
Try being his daughter.

427
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,414
Any reason he'd be
especially hard on Tommy ?

428
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,285
Look, he was cute,

429
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,654
but dad didn't have anything
to worry about.

430
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,611
Tommy was focused on the game.

431
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:52,964
Besides, he had enough problems

432
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,923
without me adding to them.

433
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:59,424
<i>"Night moves" by Bob Seger.</i>

434
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,819
Hey, Molly !

435
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,336
Slap shot's coming along.

436
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:18,106
Yeah, I'm not sure your dad
would say the same thing.

437
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,949
You're still here, aren't you ?

438
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:22,118
Yeah, what's left of me.

439
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:26,249
I don't really know
what I'm doing out here.

440
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,050
Logging all these hours.

441
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,584
I don't know
if I'll ever be any good.

442
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:33,204
Yeah, you should probably quit.

443
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:37,457
Yeah. Maybe.

444
00:19:40,331 --> 00:19:42,597
Are you going to that
new year's eve party,

445
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,895
Uh, over on Cumberland ?

446
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,363
Thinking about it. Why ?

447
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:50,573
Oh, no, I just was... wondering,

448
00:19:50,698 --> 00:19:52,607
maybe... maybe...

449
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,470
Yeah, maybe... what ?

450
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:58,187
I don't know. Maybe I'd see you
over there or something ?

451
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,942
What the hell did I tell you ?!

452
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,468
I told you not to touch it,
didn't I ?

453
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,371
- Just checking the...
- Didn't I ?

454
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,066
Now you're out here
driving slap shots with it ?

455
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:09,567
Sean, I'm not...

456
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:12,186
You think I'm washed up, isn't it ?
You think I'm done ?

457
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,021
- No, sean, I don't...
- The stick's mine !

458
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:18,174
I catch you with it again, I'm
gonna take it upside your head.

459
00:20:24,386 --> 00:20:27,767
You could smell the whiskey
coming off the guy ten feet away.

460
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:31,078
So Sean was still playing hockey
back then ?

461
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:33,147
You get a look at the stick ?

462
00:20:33,216 --> 00:20:34,272
Not really.

463
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:37,890
But he definitely had that
washed-up jock thing going on.

464
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,887
I've seen my share.

465
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,419
You Valens ?

466
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,298
Yeah.

467
00:20:46,423 --> 00:20:47,754
Pierson, central.

468
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:51,348
Got six messages asking
about a robbery pattern.

469
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,202
Listen, uh...

470
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:59,382
Dayley's market...
what do you got ?

471
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,434
Couple of similars
around the neighborhood,

472
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,551
same M.O.

473
00:21:02,676 --> 00:21:05,388
Knockdown purse snatchings,
older female victims.

474
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:06,389
Any injuries?

475
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,016
Bumps and bruises;
nothing serious.

476
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,142
Well, what about leads?

477
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,643
Uh, description,
eyeballs, anything?

478
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:13,645
Usual mess...
he's black, he's white,

479
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,864
He's tall, he's a half-pint.

480
00:21:16,764 --> 00:21:18,548
What's with you on this thing ?

481
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:20,449
Nothing. A case we got.

482
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:22,441
Just keep me posted, will you ?

483
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,872
Still gives you goose bumps, huh ?

484
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,374
Even my russian grandpop
went bonkers.

485
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:34,711
People forget

486
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:37,512
we still had to beat the Finns
just to get a medal.

487
00:21:38,784 --> 00:21:41,682
What's this I hear about you
going back out on the ice again ?

488
00:21:42,797 --> 00:21:44,007
Little pickup league.

489
00:21:44,132 --> 00:21:46,496
Me and some guys
reliving our glory days.

490
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:47,697
You want to come ?

491
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:48,698
You ain't seen hockey

492
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,141
till you seen it live.

493
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,647
I'll have the EMT's waiting.

494
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:53,516
So Sean wasn't just good,

495
00:21:53,641 --> 00:21:55,647
he was Sean
"the shamrock" Flanagan.

496
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:57,982
Real stud on ice
in Canada.

497
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,151
Champion center
in the AAA leagues.

498
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,537
Shot at the miracle team in '80.

499
00:22:01,538 --> 00:22:03,938
"Stick and blade magazine,
March '79."

500
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,783
Take a look at the stick.

501
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:09,744
You see that ?

502
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:22,465
There it is.

503
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:23,891
A shamrock.

504
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,478
Luck of the irish
just ran out.

505
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,233
Impressive stuff, shamrock.

506
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,894
Most athletes, can't shut 'em up
about their glory days.

507
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,184
But you,

508
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,630
a champion...

509
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:39,231
not so much as a peep.

510
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,042
Why so bashful, Sean ?

511
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,068
Ancient history.
Everything I had got taken away.

512
00:22:46,093 --> 00:22:47,489
Accident on your bike
in Calgary.

513
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:48,783
Blindsided, right ?

514
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,141
Shattered my femur.
Same night you found out

515
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:52,442
you were invited
to the olympic tryouts.

516
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:54,975
Could've been the only
Philly kid on the squad.

517
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,717
So close I
could taste it.

518
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,345
Night of the accident,

519
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,664
Your blood alcohol level
was a .16.

520
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:04,544
Witnesses say you were playing
chicken with a logging truck.

521
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:06,175
Wasn't an accident
benched you.

522
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,944
Just pure stupidity.

523
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,211
Is that you,

524
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,213
with the stick
that killed your brother?

525
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,391
Same stick you said
wasn't yours ?

526
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:23,057
I never wanted to see
this damn thing again.

527
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,361
The night I crashed...

528
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,693
this stick survived the impact
that ended my career.

529
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,535
Not even a scratch on it.

530
00:23:32,697 --> 00:23:34,077
Killed my brother.

531
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:36,967
Thing is cursed.

532
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:39,844
Stick didn't ice your brother
on its own, Sean.

533
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:41,126
Somebody swung it.

534
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:42,573
Not me.

535
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,406
Didn't want to admit it then,

536
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:47,507
but it was Tommy's time.

537
00:23:53,957 --> 00:23:56,049
Idiot Dwight called
for you again.

538
00:23:57,251 --> 00:23:59,118
I'll catch up with him
after the game.

539
00:24:00,954 --> 00:24:02,188
Are you coming today ?

540
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:03,556
Ma's not doing good.

541
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:06,058
Needs me here.

542
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:09,897
Hey, Tommy.

543
00:24:11,198 --> 00:24:12,298
Alberta...

544
00:24:12,926 --> 00:24:15,934
Final 20 seconds of the game,
I get a clean breakaway.

545
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:18,285
Mancuso's in the goal and...

546
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:21,706
Man, I don't even know how
it happened, I just...

547
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,750
I moved my hands,
you know, and this stick

548
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,509
put it in the twine.

549
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:32,480
Won the championship.

550
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:37,032
That's yours now.

551
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:41,729
Sean, you're gonna need that,
you know, when you get back to Calgary.

552
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:43,400
It ain't gonna happen.

553
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:44,826
It's over, Tommy.

554
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,261
Look, it's your time now,
bro, okay ?

555
00:24:48,874 --> 00:24:50,035
Take it.

556
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,081
Stick didn't win
that game, Sean.

557
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,542
It was all you.

558
00:25:04,578 --> 00:25:05,848
I'll tell you what.

559
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:11,216
You girls win today,
I'll catch your next home game.

560
00:25:11,484 --> 00:25:13,752
Maybe even bring ma.

561
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:18,390
Now go on, get out of here.

562
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,543
I wanted to watch the olympics
with him that night.

563
00:25:29,368 --> 00:25:30,945
But he said he had plans.

564
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:33,138
You never mentioned these plans
to the police.

565
00:25:33,206 --> 00:25:35,473
Just figured he'd blown
me off for the team.

566
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,442
Like maybe they accepted him.

567
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:43,457
I used to love that game,
you know ?

568
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,502
Give anything to get back
on the ice with my brother...

569
00:25:47,677 --> 00:25:49,253
Just one time.

570
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:00,464
Thanks, Michelle.

571
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:02,432
Scotty, you should
eat something.

572
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,266
You look thin.

573
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:05,968
Listen, I've been
looking into things

574
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:08,036
up at dayley's market.

575
00:26:08,104 --> 00:26:09,571
Scotty, I told you alread...

576
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:11,573
Ma, I know what
happened to you.

577
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,408
The guy knocked you down,

578
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:16,677
took your purse.

579
00:26:17,345 --> 00:26:18,912
Did you get a look at him ?

580
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:23,683
It was my fault.

581
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:28,720
Walking out,
I knew something was off.

582
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,323
I feel like a fool.

583
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,725
Had to cancel all my cards.

584
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:34,826
It's not your fault.

585
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:35,860
It just happens.

586
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,528
You don't got time
to react.

587
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,598
No. Your father...

588
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,333
He'd have gone crazy
if I told him.

589
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,834
Never let me
out of his sight.

590
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,869
No, pops don't need to know.

591
00:26:47,537 --> 00:26:48,739
But, ma, look,

592
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,207
I need you to help me
stop this guy

593
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,276
From hitting
anybody else.

594
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,512
I have some mug shots
I need you to look at.

595
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,614
Oh, mijo,
it all happened too fast.

596
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,115
I didn't see him.

597
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,985
I want to help you...

598
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,555
... but I can't.

599
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,730
Your boys are roughing up
Trenton tonight, huh ?

600
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,465
14 and six, hungry season.

601
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,767
This kind of distraction's
hard on them.

602
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:19,701
Since when do you care
about your players ?

603
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:21,170
Drive them hard,

604
00:27:21,238 --> 00:27:22,972
burn them out, move on.

605
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,107
Yeah, made a career of it,

606
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:26,275
starting with the dock rats
in '80.

607
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:28,043
Don't run games
that way anymore.

608
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:30,178
A different time,
a different game.

609
00:27:30,746 --> 00:27:33,181
So the night
of the miracle on ice,

610
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:34,683
remember where you were ?

611
00:27:34,751 --> 00:27:36,952
Meeting with the owner,
ran long.

612
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,921
Future of the team was at stake.

613
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:40,055
See, that's strange,

614
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:42,091
Because we checked
with his secretary.

615
00:27:42,158 --> 00:27:43,959
Said the team owner
was on a plane

616
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:46,395
back to Boston
early that night.

617
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:48,530
A snowstorm was blowing in--
flew out to beat it.

618
00:27:49,098 --> 00:27:50,331
Missed the miracle.

619
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,800
Must have mixed up my times.

620
00:27:51,868 --> 00:27:53,969
That's not the only thing
about that meeting you got mixed up.

621
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:55,938
Like trying to get Tommy
kicked off the team.

622
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:57,440
Now hold on.

623
00:27:57,507 --> 00:28:00,042
No, owner said no way.
That Tommy had spunk.

624
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,677
The kid was a draw.

625
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:03,345
You were pissed.

626
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:05,747
The next day, Tommy's on ice,
and you're lying

627
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:07,649
- about what you were doing.
- I don't have to listen to this.

628
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:10,118
How come you don't talk to
your daughter anymore, coach ?

629
00:28:11,053 --> 00:28:12,654
Molly.

630
00:28:13,522 --> 00:28:15,991
Hard as I was on my players,
I was tougher on her.

631
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:17,592
Or after you iced her boyfriend,

632
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,260
the two of youse
had a falling out.

633
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,329
Rules on Molly were clear,

634
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:23,631
but Tommy was violating
the policy.

635
00:28:23,699 --> 00:28:25,265
You couldn't get
rid of him one way,

636
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:27,066
time to run a different play.

637
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:29,837
- One that ends with him dead.
- You got it wrong.

638
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:33,307
Any player I wouldn't have
minded seeing Molly with,

639
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,775
It was Tommy.

640
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:37,712
Kid had more guts
than any guy I ever coached.

641
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:41,349
<i>"Fire down below" by Bob Seger.</i>

642
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:43,218
<i>We are scoreless<i>

643
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:45,788
<i>and down to the last two minutes
of the third period.</i>

644
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:47,656
<i>Both teams fighting it out
back and forth.</i>

645
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:49,091
Nothing in the twine.

646
00:28:51,895 --> 00:28:54,998
<i>Oh, and yet another
illegal hit</i>

647
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,366
<i>from Cullen Masters.</i>

648
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:59,103
<i>I'll tell you,
that's going to draw a penalty.</i>

649
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,406
You're throwing me out
'cause this little freak ?!

650
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:02,707
Get up, punk !

651
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:07,012
Catch you alone,
I'm gonna kick your candy-ass!

652
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,482
<i>Cullen Masters ejected
from the game.</i>

653
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,950
And none too soon.

654
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:13,687
Tommy Flanagan will get
the penalty shot.

655
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:17,657
Once chance, Tommy.
Can you do this ?

656
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,826
Yeah, coach.

657
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:23,731
I got it.

658
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:38,980
<i>Flanagan shoots.</i>

659
00:29:39,047 --> 00:29:40,581
<i>He's got it !</i>

660
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:42,483
And he scores !

661
00:29:43,051 --> 00:29:45,888
<i>Little Tommy Flanagan scores !</i>

662
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:49,092
<i>One nothing at home,
Dock Rats take it !</i>

663
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:52,496
<i>Little Tommy Flanagan.</i>

664
00:29:52,764 --> 00:29:55,600
<i>Unbelievable !</i>

665
00:29:56,468 --> 00:29:57,969
<i>He is truly...</i>

666
00:29:58,037 --> 00:30:00,239
<i>a hometown hero !</i>

667
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:07,530
I put him on the spot,
he delivered.

668
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:10,134
Tried to get him released
from the Dock Rats

669
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:11,394
to offer him a better shot,

670
00:30:11,716 --> 00:30:12,805
A better shot ? How ?

671
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:15,780
A coach at Powell university
lost its

672
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,469
First line to injuries.

673
00:30:17,537 --> 00:30:19,371
Tommy could have subbed.

674
00:30:19,438 --> 00:30:20,805
Division II hockey.

675
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:22,240
A shot at college.

676
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:24,341
Well, what about Tommy
and Molly ?

677
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:27,699
Anything going on with them,
I didn't know about.

678
00:30:27,772 --> 00:30:30,017
But I wouldn't have
stood in the way.

679
00:30:35,157 --> 00:30:38,001
A little gap
in Molly's school records.

680
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:40,477
What's wrong with this picture ?

681
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:43,657
Her graduating class, 1980.

682
00:30:43,924 --> 00:30:45,824
December, 1980.

683
00:30:45,892 --> 00:30:47,627
Seven months later
than everybody else.

684
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:49,498
Straight "A" student...
how does that happen ?

685
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,036
Three days after
Tommy was killed,

686
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:55,076
Coach shipped her off
to st. Emily's in Lancaster.

687
00:30:55,443 --> 00:30:57,979
That's where good unwed catholic
girls go to have babies.

688
00:30:58,047 --> 00:30:59,382
No one's supposed
to know about.

689
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:02,018
So Tommy and Molly
weren't just close.

690
00:31:02,086 --> 00:31:03,754
She was pregnant.

691
00:31:03,822 --> 00:31:05,924
And coach covered it up.

692
00:31:05,992 --> 00:31:07,527
No wonder they don't
talk anymore.

693
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:09,397
Let's bring Molly back in.

694
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:12,069
Work both of them
till one of them cracks.

695
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:17,358
I have to say,

696
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,459
I kinda get what you saw
in Tommy.

697
00:31:22,025 --> 00:31:23,761
Not a bad looking kid.

698
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:25,931
I told you

699
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,866
we weren't involved that way.

700
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:30,707
The Dock Rats said
you two were getting pretty close.

701
00:31:30,774 --> 00:31:33,010
That is up until
Tommy got killed.

702
00:31:33,078 --> 00:31:35,378
And you got carted off
the Lancaster,

703
00:31:35,446 --> 00:31:36,947
in the middle
of your senior year.

704
00:31:37,014 --> 00:31:38,748
St. Emily's.

705
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:41,050
Why there, Molly ?

706
00:31:41,118 --> 00:31:42,451
<i>Your daughter was pregnant.</i>

707
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:46,153
You went out on a limb
for Tommy Flanagan.

708
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:48,988
- And this is how he pays you back ?
- The kid was a sniper.

709
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:51,690
He finds an opportunity,
he puts it in the net.

710
00:31:51,758 --> 00:31:54,093
Molly never told me
who the father was.

711
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:56,495
But you knew,
didn't you, coach ?

712
00:31:57,963 --> 00:31:59,464
He was ashamed of you.

713
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:02,633
He sent you away,
forced you to give up the baby.

714
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,936
He was my father.

715
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:05,871
He was protecting me.

716
00:32:05,939 --> 00:32:07,673
No, he was trying to sweep it
under the rug.

717
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:08,907
Erase it from history

718
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:11,042
- by killing Tommy...
- You don't understand !

719
00:32:12,712 --> 00:32:15,680
She wanted to give the baby up.
It was her choice.

720
00:32:15,748 --> 00:32:18,048
You're saying you were fine
with her keeping it ?

721
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:19,149
Then ?

722
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:21,318
No.

723
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:24,288
If I could take it all back,

724
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:26,189
handle things differently,

725
00:32:26,255 --> 00:32:28,156
I'd do it in a second.

726
00:32:28,223 --> 00:32:30,358
But that night, when Molly
told you she was pregnant,

727
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:32,593
- you went to the rink.
- No !

728
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:37,597
I swear to you,
I did not kill that boy.

729
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:41,535
If I just told him the truth...

730
00:32:42,902 --> 00:32:45,337
Maybe Tommy would
still be alive.

731
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:48,573
Told him what, Molly ?

732
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,274
About the baby.

733
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:53,009
What about the baby ?

734
00:32:54,477 --> 00:32:56,381
It wasn't Tommy's.

735
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:01,418
Whose was he ?

736
00:33:01,485 --> 00:33:03,687
Oh, God.

737
00:33:06,724 --> 00:33:08,757
I'm so ashamed.

738
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:10,192
Yes ! Yes !

739
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,027
Yes ! Did you see that ?!

740
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:13,395
<i>It's a miracle !<i>

741
00:33:14,162 --> 00:33:15,730
We won !

742
00:33:15,797 --> 00:33:17,232
We just won !

743
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:22,972
Hey. Hey, come on.
We won.

744
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,142
What's wrong ?

745
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,044
Tommy, that party...

746
00:33:28,145 --> 00:33:29,578
New year's eve...

747
00:33:29,846 --> 00:33:31,813
I thought you were
gonna be there.

748
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:33,348
I waited.

749
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:36,017
He kept saying you were coming,

750
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:37,585
That you were his boy.

751
00:33:37,752 --> 00:33:39,387
Wait. Who said that ?

752
00:33:39,454 --> 00:33:41,188
I couldn't even taste
the alcohol.

753
00:33:41,256 --> 00:33:43,390
Didn't realize
I was getting so

754
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:44,791
drunk.

755
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:47,560
He started
kissing me.

756
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:50,295
Oh, God, I let him !

757
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:52,764
Molly, who ?

758
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,266
Dwight.

759
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:58,503
It was Dwight.

760
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,206
Tommy,
I'm pregnant.

761
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,143
I tried to tell
him about it,

762
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,145
but he won't even
look at me.

763
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:15,050
Tommy, please,

764
00:34:15,118 --> 00:34:17,485
I'm so sorry.

765
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:21,454
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

766
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,625
I broke his heart.

767
00:34:30,794 --> 00:34:32,628
Mine, too.

768
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,897
After you told him, he left...

769
00:34:35,964 --> 00:34:37,765
and headed back to the rink ?

770
00:34:39,267 --> 00:34:43,569
Yeah. Said he needed
a place to think.

771
00:34:46,973 --> 00:34:48,240
My dad came home,

772
00:34:48,307 --> 00:34:49,407
he'd seen I was crying.

773
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:52,210
I told him I was pregnant.

774
00:34:53,612 --> 00:34:55,446
And let him believe
it was Tommy's.

775
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,485
Had the baby that fall...

776
00:35:02,553 --> 00:35:05,853
little girl.

777
00:35:06,221 --> 00:35:09,023
Never found out
what happened to her.

778
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,327
But not a day goes by

779
00:35:12,394 --> 00:35:14,962
I don't think of them both.

780
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:23,968
Molly, what name did you put
on the birth certificate

781
00:35:24,036 --> 00:35:25,236
as the father ?

782
00:35:25,304 --> 00:35:27,372
None.

783
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,608
I left it blank.

784
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:39,448
How's that look ?

785
00:35:39,516 --> 00:35:41,183
Gotta fade the type
a little more.

786
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:42,651
Spill some
coffee on it.

787
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,818
Try this one.

788
00:35:44,986 --> 00:35:47,154
I'll run it through
The copier again.

789
00:35:47,222 --> 00:35:48,522
Snowplow owner confirmed

790
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,724
Dwight Bbarnes worked for him
until March of 1980.

791
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:55,328
"Fired for cause subcontracting
plow jobs to his 14-year-old brother."

792
00:35:55,396 --> 00:35:57,897
For months.
Boss got wind when the kid

793
00:35:57,964 --> 00:36:00,532
fell asleep at the wheel and
plowed into a dunkin' donuts.

794
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,069
So Dwight wasn't working
the night tommy was killed.

795
00:36:06,172 --> 00:36:08,773
Remember a girl
named molly heaton?

796
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:10,607
Coach's daughter, right ?

797
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:12,009
Major babe.

798
00:36:12,177 --> 00:36:13,910
You ever hook up with that?

799
00:36:14,578 --> 00:36:17,113
I could've.
It's hard to say.

800
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:18,348
How's that work ?
You ply her

801
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:20,316
with the schuylkill swill
and quaaludes,

802
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:21,584
till she don't know
what hit her ?

803
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:24,786
Please. I had it
going on au naturel.

804
00:36:24,854 --> 00:36:26,655
I didn't need
no chemical help.

805
00:36:26,722 --> 00:36:29,058
Well, you must've peaked
in the '80s, Dwight,

806
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:30,859
'cause I just don't see it.

807
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:32,826
Now, Tommy,
that's different;

808
00:36:32,894 --> 00:36:34,661
Athlete, star on the ice.

809
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:36,529
Little Tommy ? Come on.

810
00:36:36,597 --> 00:36:37,897
Snakin' your
best friend's girl

811
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:39,566
WWhile he's not looking ?
What kind of loser move is that ?

812
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:41,767
I never tapped that girl,
all right ?

813
00:36:42,435 --> 00:36:44,302
She shouldn't flatter herself.

814
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,108
Well, congratulations,
Dwight,

815
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,243
you're a father.

816
00:36:57,246 --> 00:36:58,982
Whoa. Whoa, wait a minute.

817
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,317
You never hooked up with Molly ?

818
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,818
How's your name
on the birth certificate ?

819
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,152
What is it,
immaculate conception ?

820
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,687
The bitch is lying !

821
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:06,622
That's not my kid.

822
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,357
Not my kid, not my problem.

823
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:10,925
You banged Tommy's girl
to bring him down a peg.

824
00:37:10,993 --> 00:37:12,627
Tommy was ducking
your phone calls.

825
00:37:12,695 --> 00:37:14,229
Getting respect on the ice.

826
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:17,297
He had a shot to go to college,
a better life.

827
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:18,765
He was leavin' you
in the dust.

828
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:20,033
You had to put him
in his place.

829
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:22,369
That's crap !
You don't know jack.

830
00:37:22,436 --> 00:37:24,671
Know it was your brother driving
the snowplow that night.

831
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:26,939
Your alibi? Just bit the dust.

832
00:37:27,007 --> 00:37:29,875
And we know Tommy was pissed
at you for jumping on Molly.

833
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:32,911
And we got the DNA off the stick
that killed Tommy.

834
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:35,413
Gonna match yours ?

835
00:37:37,682 --> 00:37:40,184
Well, you're gonna need
a sample from me, aren't you ?

836
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:44,587
No way.
It ain't gonna happen.

837
00:37:45,355 --> 00:37:48,292
- You sure about that, Dwight ?
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

838
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,694
Because I know my rights,
and you've gotta have my consent.

839
00:37:55,132 --> 00:37:56,332
Come here !

840
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:00,768
You just gave it.

841
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:07,273
Hey, you get out
in front of this,

842
00:38:07,341 --> 00:38:09,674
ve'll talk to the DA,
tell him you cooperated,

843
00:38:09,741 --> 00:38:11,840
and see what we can do.

844
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,575
Damn.

845
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,846
This whole Molly thing,

846
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:18,747
he couldn't let it go.

847
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:20,214
He hardly even knew
the girl.

848
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:23,249
You and Tommy were pals
long before that, right ?

849
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:24,885
That's what I'm saying.

850
00:38:25,153 --> 00:38:27,388
I just went there to talk.

851
00:38:28,855 --> 00:38:31,125
He acted like
he was better than me.

852
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:53,341
Figured I'd find you here.

853
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:56,143
Some win, huh ?

854
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:58,579
Chicks are going ape out there.

855
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:00,614
Maybe even get you laid.

856
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,550
Miracles happen, right ?

857
00:39:04,818 --> 00:39:06,385
What the hell is wrong with you ?

858
00:39:07,153 --> 00:39:08,654
Molly.

859
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,422
I know what you did, Dwight.

860
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:11,956
Tommy, listen...

861
00:39:12,024 --> 00:39:16,393
- You knew I liked her, man.
- Come on, lt ! I told you

862
00:39:16,461 --> 00:39:18,796
chicks respect guys who step up,

863
00:39:18,797 --> 00:39:20,497
pull the trigger.

864
00:39:20,564 --> 00:39:22,298
She's pregnant, dwight.

865
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:26,001
Come on.

866
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:28,437
That kid could be anybody's,

867
00:39:28,505 --> 00:39:30,905
sporty little slut like that.

868
00:39:33,575 --> 00:39:35,476
What the hell, Tommy ?!

869
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:39,680
What are you,
like some big shot now ?

870
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:42,149
Wouldn't be out here
if it wasn't for me.

871
00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:48,121
Man, just get out of here.

872
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:49,722
Get out of here.

873
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,591
Oh, play a few hockey games,

874
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:53,894
now all of a sudden
you're too good to call me back ?

875
00:39:53,962 --> 00:39:55,162
Blowing me off ?

876
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,198
Loses the girl.
Well, boo-hoo !

877
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:01,200
Now Little Tommy's
gonna judge me.

878
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:03,269
Little Tommy, tell me
how to live my life ?

879
00:40:03,337 --> 00:40:05,605
Tommy ?
I ain't Little Tommy no more !

880
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:07,439
You don't get to call me that !

881
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:10,308
Everybody always
calls you a tool,

882
00:40:10,376 --> 00:40:12,211
and I'm the only one
that sticks by you !

883
00:40:12,278 --> 00:40:13,512
The only one !

884
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,117
Let you push me around,
I play your wingman, 

885
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:18,718
for this ?!

886
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:21,854
They're right about you...

887
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:24,089
You're nothing but a loser.

888
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:30,596
Take it back, LT.

889
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:32,398
That kid is better off

890
00:40:32,465 --> 00:40:34,900
not knowing the truth
about you, anyway.

891
00:40:48,438 --> 00:40:51,406
Take it back, Tommy !

892
00:40:51,474 --> 00:40:53,005
Take it back !

893
00:40:56,408 --> 00:40:58,709
You're a loser, Dwight.

894
00:40:59,477 --> 00:41:01,112
You always will be.

<i>"Against the wind" by Bob Seger.</i>

896
00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:36,700
* Seems like yesterday *

897
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:41,469
* But it was long ago *

898
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:43,404
* Janey was lovely *

899
00:41:43,472 --> 00:41:45,472
* She was the queen of my nights*

900
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,676
* There in the darkness
with the radio playing low *

901
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:54,579
* And the secrets that we shared *

902
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:59,349
* Mountains that we moved *

903
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,585
*Caught like a wildfire out of control*

904
00:42:03,052 --> 00:42:05,286
* Till there was nothing left to burn *

905
00:42:05,354 --> 00:42:07,859
* and nothing left to prove *

906
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:13,199
* And I remember
what she said to me *

907
00:42:13,966 --> 00:42:18,069
* How she swore
that it never would end *

908
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:22,406
* I remember how she held me,
oh, so tight *

909
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,910
* Wish I didn't know now
what I didn't know then *

910
00:42:28,645 --> 00:42:30,412
* Against the wind *

911
00:42:33,114 --> 00:42:35,283
* We were running against the wind *

912
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,919
*We were young and strong*

913
00:42:37,987 --> 00:42:41,522
* We were running against the wind *

914
00:42:50,697 --> 00:42:53,900
* and the years rolled slowly past *

915
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:57,702
* and I found myself alone *

916
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:02,206
* Surrounded by strangers
I thought were my friends *

917
00:43:03,074 --> 00:43:06,609
* I found myself further and further
from my home *

918
00:43:08,178 --> 00:43:11,613
* And I guess I lost my way *

919
00:43:12,281 --> 00:43:14,516
* There were, oh, so many roads *

920
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:18,619
* I was living to run
and running to live *

921
00:43:19,487 --> 00:43:23,957
* Never worried about paying
or even how much I owed *

922
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:29,895
* Moving eight miles a minute
for months at a time *

923
00:43:30,363 --> 00:43:34,798
* Breaking all of the rules
that would bend *

924
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:38,633
*I began to find myself searching...*

925
