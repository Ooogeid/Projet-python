00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,840
<i>The U.S. Air Force plays.</i>

3
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,500
Farmer's putting on a real show.

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,230
Must have used up his gas
dusting his crops.

5
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,280
Rations run out ? Coming
to the base for handouts ?

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,800
Oh, man, not another one.

7
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,940
Bad enough we got to
deal with 'em at home.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,160
Now they're taking over
the base, too ?

9
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,930
War's got this whole
country turned upside-down.

10
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,540
Miss Lynn, I presume.

11
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,850
Reporting for duty, ma'am.

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,620
Miss Lynn thinks
she's an HP, ladies.

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,940
That right ?

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,760
- Think you're a hot pilot ?
- Not an HP, ma'am. A Miss HP.

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,900
Army won't tolerate
tardiness or grandstanding.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,130
Neither will I.

17
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,050
You girls have the honor
and privilege

18
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:20,751
to be of the first women
trained by the Army Air Force.

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,630
You may be good pilots, Miss HP,

20
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:27,831
but here, you'll learn to fly
the Army way.

21
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,310
Captain James.

22
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,410
Ladies, you either check
out with me, or you wash out.

23
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,080
Fail your check flights,

24
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,681
can't pass ground school,

25
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:44,282
have an attitude...
I will wash you out.

26
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,390
Captain.

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,170
Hey, can you teach me
to fly like that ?

28
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,220
Say, if you're giving out
free lessons, sign me up, too.

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,600
Just 'cause cowgirl
can dust a few crops

30
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:00,101
doesn't mean she can handle
a supercharged V-12 Army plane.

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,700
Oh, hell, if it's got wings
and an engine, I can fly it.

32
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,370
Must be hard making ends
meet since PMI canned you.

33
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,760
Detective, to what do I owe
the pleasure ?

34
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,410
You here for a loan ?

35
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,160
Wonder if the good people
at Emerson Mutual

36
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:59,761
know who they're considering
giving money to.

37
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,920
You're kidding me, right ?

38
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,660
Attempted homicide of a police officer.

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,390
Now, that's got to hurt
your FICO score.

40
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,300
Cute trick, putting the boot
on my car.

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,220
You just don't know when to quit,
do you ?

42
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,230
Hard time making those
payments from jail.

43
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,900
You sure you want to do this ?

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,660
You'd be surprised
what I can do, Moe.

45
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,140
Alarm clock broke ?

46
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,410
Had to go to the bank.

47
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,611
What have we got ?

48
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,390
Environmental group's trying to turn
the reservoir into a bird sanctuary.

49
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,710
Consultant found
this P-51 Mustang

50
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:46,511
with skeletal remains.

51
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,470
Oh, that's some bird.

52
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,740
Mustang was a WWII combat plane.

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,930
My father flew one in the war.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,970
- Who's the pilot ?
- Vivian... Lynn.

55
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,730
Female pilot in WWII ?

56
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,520
Vivian was a member of the WASP :

57
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:02,821
Women Airforce Service Pilots.

58
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,340
Veterans Affairs says one of 'em
went missing in 1944.

59
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:06,641
Guess we found her.

60
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,890
I thought women pilots weren't
accepted in the military till the '70s.

61
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,520
WASP weren't military.

62
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,170
They flew as civilians
on non-combat missions.

63
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,120
CSU found this waterproof rucksack

64
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:18,921
stashed in the wing's bullet
compartment.

65
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,510
What kind of mission you
need a skirt and heels for ?

66
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,390
And no one saw the plane
go down ?

67
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,400
Area was mostly farmland
back in '44,

68
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:28,601
but the NTSB said

69
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,202
her oil and coolant lines
were switched.

70
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,710
Looking at a case of sabotage.

71
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,510
Someone wanted this flier grounded.

72
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,050
Cold Case
Season 7 Episode 05

73
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,850
Transcript VO : www.ydy.com

74
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,420
WASP

75
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,890
Vivian Lynn, 22 years old,

76
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:15,691
grew up
on a farm in Belle Plaine, Iowa.

77
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,600
Here.

78
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,690
Flew a crop duster for her family.

79
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,940
Applied for the WASP program
in '43.

80
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,950
Young Betties in a cockpit.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,620
Think I would have
heard of 'em before now.

82
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,650
Vivian was stationed in Wilmington,
Delaware,

83
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:30,251
at New Castle Army Air Base.

84
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,480
She took off June 2, 1944, at 0600
hours to deliver the P-51 to...

85
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,340
Camp Davis in North Carolina.

86
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,730
Declared missing in service
when she never showed.

87
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,200
Army searched for her plane
till July.

88
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,100
The orders were to fly south,

89
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:49,001
but her plane was in Philly,
so why was she traveling north ?

90
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,290
Back then, most planes
didn't have radar.

91
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,791
Some of them didn't even have radios.

92
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,910
You couldn't track a plane
once it was in the air.

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,600
So, Vivian was bucking her orders ?
Flying somewhere else ?

94
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,200
Doer had access to her plane.

95
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,990
Knew how to switch coolant
and oil lines.

96
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:02,991
Could be a mechanic.

97
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,570
Can't imagine the men were
too happy sharing their base.

98
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,920
I'll check the records
for anyone fits the bill.

99
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,480
Ask the base for flight schedules,
accident reports.

100
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,160
Bunkmate was Betty Joe Henders.

101
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,110
Lives in Germantown.

102
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,790
If anyone had a beef
with Vivian, she'd know.

103
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,330
Can't wait to meet one
of these Betties.

104
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:20,731
Slow down, just slow down, Pops.

105
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,350
I mean, what do you mean,
money's missing from your account ?

106
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,010
Well, what do you want me to do ?
Ask Ma.

107
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,020
Yeah, I'm at work.
I'll call you back.

108
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,200
I found the WASP C.O.
Iris Keening.

109
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,610
Still in Wilmington, Delaware.

110
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,860
Headed up the search
party for Vivian herself.

111
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,260
Well, go have a talk,
see if she can shed some light

112
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:47,661
on why Vivian was flying over
the City of Brotherly Love.

113
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,590
Army said winds caused the crash,

114
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:04,691
but that girl could have flown through a
tornado and been in the mess hall at showtime.

115
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,850
You headed up the search party ?

116
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,790
38 girls died in crashes during the two
years the program was up and running.

117
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,280
- Brave women.
- Pioneers.

118
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,830
Knew if they failed,

119
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:17,931
no women after them
would stand a chance.

120
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,660
Who would have had
access to Vivian's plane?

121
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,050
Known how to switch the lines ?

122
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,920
Hmm, mechanics, instructors,
all the pilots.

123
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,840
Any ideas
why she was flying off course ?

124
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,590
Rumor was she had a boyfriend.

125
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,980
City slicker in Manhattan.

126
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,190
Remember a name ?

127
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,960
Vivian wasn't like the other gals.

128
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,590
Showed up late to her first day,

129
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:44,091
hotdoggin' in her own crop duster.

130
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,960
Attitude didn't get her washed out ?

131
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,130
Can't wash out your best pilot.

132
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,310
I needed her on the schedule.

133
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,180
Anyone you think of
had a problem with her ?

134
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,890
Vivian had a habit of
rubbing people the wrong way.

135
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,870
Hate to say it, but

136
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:01,771
"Miss HP" only cared about
one person :

137
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:02,872
herself.

138
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,040
<i>"Pistol Packin' Mama"
by Bing Crosby & the Andrews Sisters</i>

139
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,240
Edna !

140
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,480
Come on, give her some oxygen.

141
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,700
There you go. There you go.
Just breathe.

142
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,550
Lynn, you've set a new record.

143
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,680
- All for one, huh,Viv. / - Reckon you
could have at least given her a hand.

144
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,270
Somebody's got to fly
the plane for you nurses.

145
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,700
She wasn't interested in making friends.

146
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,290
Each week, the WASP flight
scores were posted on a chart.

147
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,390
And Vivian wanted to be on top.

148
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,940
Wouldn't settle for anything less.

149
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,470
Gonna need a list of those WASP.
Their instructor, too.

150
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,780
It's all in my book.

151
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,700
Listed alphabetically in the appendix.

152
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,890
"Happy landings always".

153
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,180
What we WASP say
instead of good-bye.

154
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,809
Betty Joe Henders ?

155
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,425
Y'all call me Grammy.

156
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,175
Everybody else does.

157
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,245
You were a pursuit pilot, right ?

158
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,185
Lifetime ago. Never fit in
those itty-bitty cockpits now.

159
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,485
You understand.

160
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,505
Detectives Jeffries, Vera.

161
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,995
You were Vivian Lynn's
bunkmate at New Castle Airbase?

162
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,885
Haven't heard that name in ages.

163
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,405
Detectives ?

164
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,775
Thought bad weather
caused the crash.

165
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,625
How'd you two get along ?

166
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,405
Peas in a pod.

167
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,430
Both from small towns,
poor families.

168
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,025
You fly a crop duster, too ?

169
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,110
I took the Army's civil course
for my pilot's license.

170
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,860
Had to beg my cousin Donald

171
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:24,861
for the last sawbuck
just to afford the classes.

172
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,750
When was the last time
you saw Vivian ?

173
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,825
Day or two before she disappeared.

174
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,600
She ever talk about going
to New York, meet a boyfriend ?

175
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,844
Gals were all khaki wacky,
but not Viv.

176
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,454
'Course we didn't call the
base The Snake Pit for nothing.

177
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,610
<i>"Sing, Sing, Sing"
by Louis Prima.</i>

178
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,436
Kick the tires and light
the fires. I'm on a roll.

179
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,815
- You want to go again ?
- Game's making me thirsty.

180
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,740
Think I'll get some juice.

181
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,895
Suit yourself, Louise.

182
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,535
What do you say, Edna ?

183
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,595
Can't you let her win just once ?

184
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,305
Don't see any of them
flyboys throwing a game.

185
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,435
So ?

186
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,965
Army's made it clear,we
ain't one of 'em.

187
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,835
Doing the same job,
not getting paid near as much.

188
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,015
It won't change either, till we show
them we're as tough as they are.

189
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,980
Tougher even.

190
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,633
You need a lesson there, doll ?

191
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,950
You can call me Wolf.

192
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,875
I could teach you a thing or two...
you see, it's...

193
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:24,776
all in the wrist.

194
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,855
Gosh, are you a real-life pilot ?

195
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,610
Shouldn't even be telling you this.
Loose lips sink ships and all.

196
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,820
I fly the B-26.

197
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,590
See,they call it the "Widow Maker"
'cause the last three pilots...

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,055
- bought the farm.- "The Widow
Maker"-- that sounds dangerous.

199
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,865
Say, you're not married, are you ?

200
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,960
You know, I'm looking for somebody to fill
the position. Maybe you'd like to apply.

201
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,585
- Getting ahead of yourself, flyboy.
- You ain't seen nothin' yet.

202
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,840
Hey, get your meat hooks off
of me !

203
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,930
You're gonna regret that, little miss.

204
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,855
Wolf was lathered up, all right.

205
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,845
Wasn't taking no for an answer.

206
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,785
He know Vivian was a WASP ?

207
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,714
Lordy no, we were in our civvies

208
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:22,315
due to the fundamental dislike
of a woman in uniform.

209
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,185
This Wolf got a real name ?

210
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,585
Just knew him as Wolf.

211
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,205
Us girls kept a "Naughty
and Nice" list by the phone.

212
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,334
Vivian put him on the Naughty side
and no one went near that animal again.

213
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,600
One pilot with the call sign Wolf.

214
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,139
- Herbert James.
- Herbert ?

215
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:40,975
No wonder he preferred Wolf.

216
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,430
Any relation to Frank James,
the WASPs' instructor ?

217
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,642
Brothers.
Whole family of flyboys.

218
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,495
Guy had a real problem with women.

219
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,310
There's five charges of misconduct.

220
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,075
Way of saying "sexual
harassment" back in the day.

221
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,004
Vivian goes missing two weeks after Wolf
harassed her at the all-ranks club on base.

222
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,822
He was completing his
final flight test that day.

223
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,545
Would've had access to the hangar.

224
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:08,150
Maybe Wolf decided he wasn't gonna
be the only one to crash and burn.

225
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,225
You want to explain this complaint ?

226
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,020
It was filed with Internal Affairs
last night, by Moe Kitchener.

227
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,685
We aren't doing our jobs if we
don't get some complaints, right ?

228
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,535
Situation's interfering
with your job, Lil.

229
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,170
It wouldn't be if the judge did his job.

230
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,125
I understand what you're going through.

231
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,780
But Doherty's looking
for excuses like this.

232
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,295
The whole division is under scrutiny.

233
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,080
- I hear you, boss.
- Good.

234
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,125
You're a hard man to find, Herbert.

235
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,915
Kicked out of five retirement
homes for spreading a VD.

236
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,960
Four retirement homes.

237
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,660
And it was those broads
gave that VD to me.

238
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,180
I... d-don't wanna hear it.

239
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,030
Spend much time at the bar when you
were stationed at New Castle, Wolf ?

240
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,850
New Castle, sure. There
was some nice scenery.

241
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,675
Vivian Lynn part of that scenery?

242
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,645
Vivian Lynn-- the gal that
disappeared in the Mustang, right ?

243
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,985
Mustang took a nose dive
in the Roxborough Reservoir.

244
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,705
Wasn't an accident after all.

245
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,515
Now,wait a second.You saying
I had something to do with it ?

246
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,390
Heard she gave you quite the
spanking two weeks before she crashed.

247
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,340
Pulls a Little Red Riding Hood on you,
you gotta show her who's boss.

248
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,025
Oh, you got it all wrong, fellas.

249
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,520
Even a wolf knows you don't
bite the hand that feeds you.

250
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,565
Come on, Frank.

251
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,405
Let me skip this one lesson.You know, if
you can't do a favor for your own brother...

252
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,705
I do favors for you, how you
gonna learn responsibility ?

253
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,734
The Widow Maker's a flying coffin.

254
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,910
You want to send another
telegram home to Ma ?

255
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,515
Charlie ain't even cold yet.

256
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,835
Ma ain't losing another son, Wolf.
You're not gonna crash.

257
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,840
Won't even get a chance to
drop a bomb on them Krauts.

258
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,015
Last three guys landed
in a smoking hole !

259
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,560
Three guys but no women.

260
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,350
Viv,you just earned the first
perfect score on the B-26.

261
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,865
She's a pilot ?

262
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,735
She'll be teaching you to fly
The Widow Maker.

263
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:21,936
Vivian, meet your next student :
my brother Wolf.

264
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,365
Wolf, huh ? Now,how'd you
get a name like that ?

265
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,935
You got any tips for him?

266
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,705
He's fixing to wet his flight suit.

267
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,345
Oh, it's all in the wrist, flyboy.

268
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,335
Nice score, Miss HP !

269
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,485
Puts you at the top of the
chart.Uh,ya'll know what that means.

270
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,770
We have got one hot pilot!

271
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,590
Better cool her off !

272
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,470
No... no !

273
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,594
Come on !... two, three !

274
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,785
I gotta admit, she was
a pretty good teacher.

275
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,140
Never lost her cool.

276
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,635
Can't say the that for the rest of them.

277
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,455
What do you mean ?

278
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:04,856
Girls didn't belong on that base.

279
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,695
Weren't meant to be pilots.

280
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,405
Sounds like you were
still trying to get even.

281
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,825
With Frank around ?
Are you kidding ?

282
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,715
Two Type-A pilots,
match made in Army heaven.

283
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,655
Saying your brother
had a thing for Vivian ?

284
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,415
Well,I didn't know it at the
time but yeah, he was stuck on her.

285
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,015
- How long?
- Few weeks.

286
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,865
He was an officer, I was a cadet.
I had to stand down.

287
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,000
Besides, bros before hos, huh ?

288
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,170
New Castle Archive Department

289
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:39,271
can't locate the flight logs
or the monthly records.

290
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,860
Got mechanics records but most
of them are pushing daisies.

291
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,560
Looked into the 38
WASP killed in wrecks.

292
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,960
One was in Vivians's class :
Edna Reed.

293
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,440
Accident report say anything
about her lines being switched ?

294
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,790
Burned pistons. Looking like
routine mechanical failure.

295
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,390
I,uh,heard about the IAB.

296
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,160
Moe's complaint.

297
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,930
Oh... got him on the ropes.

298
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,450
Good.

299
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,050
You headed somewhere ?

300
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,940
Uh, taking lost time.

301
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,350
Everything okay ?

302
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,540
Sure, yeah, it's nothing.

303
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,400
What color does
this look like to you ?

304
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,250
Call it rucksack gray.

305
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,180
Mind if I borrow that ?

306
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,860
Hey, Ma.

307
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,400
Scotty, what are you doing here ?

308
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,520
I was just driving past, saw you walking
out of the doctor's. Everything okay ?

309
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:51,460
Uh, yeah, I just had to take
Mrs. Melztner, to Dr.Kantor's office.

310
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,890
You were in Suite 4A, right ?

311
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,680
Says Dr. Ruben on the directory.

312
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,710
Just driving by, huh ?

313
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,800
Are you sick, Ma ?

314
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,090
You following me like
some kind of criminal ?

315
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,340
Just... tell me what's going on.

316
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,240
I've got a bad knee; that's it.

317
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,290
Then why you paying in cash ?

318
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,310
What is this, the third degree ?

319
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,490
Are you a cop or are you my son ?

320
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,990
Mi hijo...

321
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,991
Will you trust me ?

322
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,110
I'm fine. It's just my knee.

323
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,220
Remember...

324
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:41,721
how I could make everything
better with a Rice Krispy treat ?

325
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,800
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Ma.

326
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,220
You close with Vivian Lynn, Frank ?

327
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,220
She was my best student, ma'am.

328
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,110
She something more than that ?

329
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,230
Well, I guess you could
say we were an item.

330
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,210
I kept it quiet 'cause
I was her instructor.

331
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,750
What's this about ?

332
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,330
Vivian's plane was sabotaged.

333
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,720
Your girl was flying off course, Frank.
Do you know why ?

334
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,120
She was an ace navigator.

335
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,930
Male pilots used to follow
her back to the base.

336
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,530
She was the only one who
could always find her way.

337
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,500
Chance she was flying
to meet a new steady ?

338
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,640
Oh, no, ma'am.

339
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,050
A lot of things can go
wrong in a relationship...

340
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,770
spirited girl like that.

341
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,400
Look here, I loved Vivian.

342
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,300
I admired her for what she
was doing for her country.

343
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,330
They weren't all as patriotic.

by Billie Holiday.</i>

345
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,020
Thought I'd find you here.

346
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,670
Never seen anything like it.

347
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,000
One of a kind.

348
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,700
Who do you think they'll let fly it ?

349
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,060
Know anyone with perfect scores ?

350
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,030
I fly this, I might just break
the sound barrier someday.

351
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,840
Flipped your wig ?

352
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,040
No one can survive flying
750 miles an hour, Viv.

353
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,550
Your heart'll seize up.

354
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,840
I know you miss your baby brother.

355
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,890
This isn't about Charlie, Viv.

356
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,550
But you can't protect everyone.

357
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,720
The day my dad shipped out,
he wasn't scared at all.

358
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,700
But I was.

359
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,490
Must've been a first for you.

360
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,920
He used to say we'd travel
with the wind and the stars.

361
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,900
This just might get me there.

362
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,380
I'll take that trip, if you're piloting.

363
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:59,450
- Betty Joe ?!
- Get your scrawny ass out here !

364
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
You been ripping my ration books ?!

365
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,020
Next time I won't just
tear 'em up, I'll report you.

366
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,820
You best not be threatening me !

367
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,050
Stealing ration books,

368
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:11,351
you might as well be taking bullets
from our boys' guns.

369
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,960
There a problem, ladies ?

370
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,860
I wash out... sure as hell gonna be.

371
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,220
I always thought Betty Joe
was a harmless Southern belle.

372
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,990
She was profiteering.

373
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,630
The war caused shortages :
coffee, food, gasoline.

374
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,090
Had to have a government
ration book to buy them.

375
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,920
If anyone had gotten wind
of what she was doing,

376
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:49,221
she'd have been tried
for treason.

377
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,970
Betty Joe didn't wash out, did she ?

378
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,500
No,ma'am.But three days
later,Vivian took off.

379
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,380
Never came back.

380
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,100
Thanks for coming in, Betty Joe.

381
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,370
I know you wanted to get
your mums in the ground today.

382
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,970
Said yesterday you had to scrape
together money

383
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:14,771
just to join the WASP.

384
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,000
Cousin Donald chipped in.

385
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,380
Remember what Donald did
during the war ?

386
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,380
4-F. He couldn't fight.

387
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,140
Worked a government job.

388
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,780
That's right.

389
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,960
Worked at a government
incineration station,

390
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:28,661
burning ration books.

391
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,170
Course they all didn't find their way
to the incinerator,

392
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:32,671
did they, Betty Joe ?

393
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,510
Y'all are whistlin' Dixie.

394
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,660
He'd sell them. Only one problem :

395
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,510
Had to get 'em on the black market
before their serial numbers expired.

396
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,560
That's where it was helpful
having access to a plane.

397
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,040
Not proud of what I did.

398
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:52,020
Husband gunned down six
months earlier over Berlin.

399
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,880
I did it for my babies.

400
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,720
Those babies the reason you had to
keep Vivian quiet about the whole thing ?

401
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,440
I didn't hurt Vivian.

402
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,040
I was upset 'cause I thought
all she wanted

403
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:08,541
was to wash out her competition.

404
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,590
Then I saw a whole another side of her.

405
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,930
I failed my last check ride.

406
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,330
If I don't pass this one,
I'm going to be washed out !

407
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,460
No one's washing out.
Just do as I say.

408
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:22,261
Everything will be fine.

409
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,910
Is it true you learned to fly your
crop duster when you were just six ?

410
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,290
Flying's gotta be second nature.

411
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,800
Gotta know the controls
without even lookin' at 'em.

412
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,760
I don't know,Viv.

413
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,250
It's better if I just wash out now.

414
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,980
I thought you said you
had a brother overseas.

415
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,110
Jimmy.

416
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,240
Call him Cricket.

417
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,150
Well, think of Cricket when you fly.

418
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,480
The next plane you deliver
might just save his life.

419
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,360
The more air support
our boys get,

420
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:56,761
the more of 'em
that'll come home.

421
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,250
Do you got any family
in the war, Viv ?

422
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,450
Army said my Dad was too old.

423
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,670
Wanted him to fly trainers.

424
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,250
He insisted on crewing a B-17.

425
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,900
Got himself killed.

426
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,850
Battery. Propeller. Booster, pumps.
Landing gear.

427
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,300
Yes !Hey, you're ready, Edna.

428
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,920
Gosh, you really think so, Viv ?

429
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:27,721
What, are you kidding ?
You're a regular Miss HP.

430
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,630
Took Vivian's advice myself.

431
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,570
Thought of my husband.

432
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,350
Reckoned I couldn't honor
him and do what I was doin'.

433
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,240
So you stopped smuggling ration
booklets right then and there?

434
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,520
Never got the chance to tell her.

435
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,870
She was gone by the time I got back.

436
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,610
Saying you weren't on base
when Vivian disappeared ?

437
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,060
Off deliverin' a plane to Sweetwater.

438
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,160
Still got my log book to prove it.

439
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,470
We're going to need to see that.

440
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,590
Got the monthly flight records
and schedules, too.

441
00:25:01,591 --> 00:25:03,191
Saved everything.

442
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,610
Shame she never got the
one thing she wanted.

443
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,750
What was that ?

444
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,990
To be the first woman to fly that jet.

445
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,930
- Remember who was ?
- Sure. Vivian's main competition.

446
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,090
Louise Patterson.

447
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,300
Louise Patterson ?

448
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,480
Yes ?

449
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,300
Flew the Bell P-59, right ?

450
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,360
First woman ever.

451
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,260
You two looking for an interview ?

452
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,830
You could say that.

453
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,530
Detectives Valens, Rush.

454
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,860
Remember your old
WASP buddy, Vivian Lynn ?

455
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,900
Of course I remember
Vivian. Real live wire.

456
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,370
How'd you feel when Vivian
dusted you on the score chart ?

457
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,660
Check your facts.

458
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,120
I was on top of the chart.

459
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,240
Oh, by default. The better
pilot was murdered.

460
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,210
Murdered ?!

461
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,450
Oh, dear God, how ?

462
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,660
I read your cover story in
The Atlantic, September '54.

463
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,410
First woman to break
the sound barrier.

464
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,350
Said you'd do anything
to set that record.

465
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,080
That include getting
rid of your competition ?

466
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,560
Look, you're right.

467
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,820
Vivian and I had a rocky start.

468
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,610
But we bonded in a way I
could never have imagined.

469
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,410
Crash !

470
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,900
It's Edna ! No ! Vivian... No !

471
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:26,230
- Wait !
- No ! No ! No ! No !

472
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,070
There is nothing you could have done.

473
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,070
No, Edna was ready.
I taught her myself.

474
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,370
Checked her plane myself.

475
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,650
Someone did this to her !

476
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,900
*Of we go Into the wild blue yonder *

477
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,620
*Climbing high into the sun *

478
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,400
*Here they come zooming
to meet our thunder *

479
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,070
*At 'em,boys *

480
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,520
*Give 'er the gun *

481
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,720
*Down we dive *

482
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,750
*Spouting our flame from under *

483
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:19,430
*Off with one heck of a roar *

484
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,640
*We live in fame *

485
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,830
*Or we go down in flame *

486
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,720
*Nothing can stop the Army Air Corps. *

487
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,520
Not a day goes by I don't
think about one of those women.

488
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,890
Vivian thought the men
wanted the WASP gone.

489
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,620
WASP were doing the
same jobs as male pilots.

490
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,920
Freeing up men for combat duty.

491
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,720
Only by this time,
the war was winding down.

492
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,920
Army had enough pilots.
It needed infantry.

493
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,800
Some of the guys were afraid
they were gonna lose their jobs ?

494
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,170
And be drafted as foot soldiers.

495
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,310
What ya got, Scotty ?

496
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,150
Army said Edna's crash

497
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:06,351
was a mechanical failure due

498
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,852
to clogged fuel lines
and burned pistons.

499
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,790
But this maintenance report says

500
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:13,391
her lines were flushed
two days prior.

501
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,060
Airport mechanic I spoke to said they
should've still been squeaky clean.

502
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,810
What if Vivian was on
to the sabotage ?

503
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,180
Doer decides to silence her for good.

504
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,240
Mechanic say what could
cause the pistons to burn ?

505
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,040
The only thing he could think
of was sugar in the gas tank.

506
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,260
But sugar was hard to
come by during the war.

507
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,410
Not if you were in the Army.

508
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:33,311
You still got the New Castle PX ledgers ?

509
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,780
Uh,yeah.

510
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,220
Uh... Uh,here.

511
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,200
Sugar was bought the
day before Edna crashed.

512
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,940
Ten pounds.

513
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,690
That's enough to gum up
the works of any engine.

514
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,940
Signed for by one...

515
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,380
Frank  James.

516
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,330
Cool your engines, Saccardo.

517
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,580
I'll be there in ten.

518
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:04,060
Okay, me, too. Bye.

519
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,690
Big date tonight ?

520
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,740
I was just heading out to
mess with you some more.

521
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,110
You want to back up your car now ?

522
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,910
Car dry up or they got you a new one ?

523
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:26,580
I said back away.

524
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,370
You going to shoot me, Detective ?

525
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:35,230
How do you think that'll look
after I filed a complaint ?

526
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,870
The more you push,
less I have to lose.

527
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,900
Been reading up on my WASP history.

528
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,440
You got something off Vivian's skirt ?

529
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,970
Sent it to Criminalistics on a hunch.

530
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,000
Found traces of...

531
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,100
alizrine cyanines.

532
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,690
Some kind of chemical ?

533
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,650
Used in Santiago Blue dye.

534
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,590
Skirt was a part of
Vivian's dress uniform.

535
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,910
She wasn't flying north for a date.

536
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,770
She was on official business.

537
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,170
Lil, Frank's in the box.
You ready ?

538
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,290
Fear is a funny thing,
isn't it, Frank ?

539
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,330
I don't know what you mean, sir.

540
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,570
You were drafted in '43,
supposed to ship off to Europe.

541
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,370
But you became a flight
instructor instead.

542
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,070
- Kept you on American soil.
- I served my country, sir.

543
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,720
WASP wanted to be recognized as equals.

544
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,680
Have the same benefits as Army men.

545
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:13,400
But if that happened, there'd be
even fewer jobs for men stateside.

546
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,090
You might've been dodging bullets
on a beach in Normandy instead.

547
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,800
I lost a baby brother over there.

548
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,270
You think maybe you could
scare them into quitting, Frank ?

549
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,840
You a tough guy ?

550
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,420
I get to do that, too.

551
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,840
I helped those girls.

552
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,200
Anything they needed,
I was there for 'em.

553
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,870
This your signature, Frank ?

554
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,770
That much sugar'd do a
real number on an engine.

555
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,410
I didn't sign this.

556
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,920
You're saying someone
forged your signature ?

557
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,520
Vivian tried to tell me...

558
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,340
but I wouldn't listen.

559
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,310
Viv ?Is that you ?

560
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,140
I had to see you.

561
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,950
Get caught past taps,
they'll wash you out.

562
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,590
I checked the mechanic's log.

563
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,410
Edna's fuel lines were
flushed two days ago.

564
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,790
- Whoa, slow down.
- Her plane shouldn't have stalled, Frank.

565
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,520
Viv, you're upset.

566
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,890
I saw Wolf milling around the
hangar last night by himself.

567
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,550
He said he was filling out his flight log,
but I know what he was doing.

568
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,200
I think he sabotaged Edna's plane.

569
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,620
Wolf would never do that.

570
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,360
You know how he feels about us girls.

571
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,150
It's not like he tries to hide it.

572
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,770
He's my brother,Viv.

573
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,380
- My brother.
- Edna was my friend...

574
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,130
and she's dead.

575
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,850
You know what my family's
been through.

576
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:54,551
Your family got a star to hang
in the window.

577
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,040
What does Edna's family get ?

578
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:58,141
The Army won't even pay
to send her home.

579
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,460
You want a damn star ?

580
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,850
I want Wolf court-martialed.

581
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,460
I love you...

582
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:10,161
but planes crash, Viv.

583
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,150
I thought we were going to travel
with the wind and the stars.

584
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,070
God help me for not believing Vivian.

585
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,660
My mother had already
lost a son in the war.

586
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,770
I couldn't let her lose another.

587
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,890
Wolf know Vivian was on his tail ?

588
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,250
I confronted him about
what she'd told me.

589
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,200
He just denied it.

590
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,400
When was that ?

591
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:56,240
It was the night before she disappeared.

592
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,860
All these years...

593
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,680
I looked out for him,
put him first.

594
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,430
Think he'd do the same for you ?

595
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,810
Just got to get you to sign a
bail petition for your brother.

596
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,130
Bail ?! What'd Frank do ?

597
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,360
Laced Edna Reed's tank
with ten pounds of sugar.

598
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:24,650
Turning him over to the
MPs for Edna's murder.

599
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,110
Frank wouldn't hurt a fly.

600
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,310
Got a New Castle PX ledger
with his signature on it.

601
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,450
It wasn't Frank.

602
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,300
It was me.

603
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,780
Drank through my paycheck
that month.

604
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,310
I had to charge everything
to Frank's account.

605
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,650
I put that sugar in Edna's tank.

606
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,550
I mean, me and the guys had
done it to other gals before.

607
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,490
I figured she'd have hit the silk
like the others did,

608
00:35:00,491 --> 00:35:02,891
parachute out
when the engine stalled.

609
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,520
Report said the latch on
the cockpit was broken.

610
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,820
I didn't know about that latch.

611
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,140
She tried to bail out,
and she couldn't.

612
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,530
She was trapped.

613
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,310
I didn't mean to hurt that girl.

614
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,090
I still have nightmares
about it to this day.

615
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,120
Gonna need the names
of your coconspirators.

616
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,760
No, I'm taking the bullet
on this one.

617
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:29,861
No sense in tarnishing
their memories.

618
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,450
Should've done it anyway the
night I went to see Vivian.

619
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,530
You saw Vivian before
she disappeared ?

620
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,580
I pleaded with her
not to report me.

621
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,090
And she didn't listen, so you
took matters into your own hands ?

622
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,860
No, I wouldn't touch a hair
on that girl's head.

623
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,420
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't.

624
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,260
- Why is that ?
- She'd already filed a report.

625
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:49,090
I saw her signature and everything.
I just went back to the barracks,

626
00:35:49,091 --> 00:35:51,491
packed my duffel, and waited.

627
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,130
MPs never came.

628
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:58,010
So who'd she file that report with ?

629
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,770
When someone filed a report with you,
what'd you do with it ?

630
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,260
Sent it up the chain of command.

631
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,300
So when Vivian filed a report
about Edna Reed's crash,

632
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:07,101
you send that up ?

633
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,700
Edna's crash was an
accident.There wasn't a report.

634
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,490
Weak sheep like Edna,

635
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:17,391
nothing but a drain
on your program.

636
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,640
You were probably happy

637
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:21,841
to have someone thin
out the herd.

638
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,650
You ask me,
they were probably all weak.

639
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,330
Women fly as well as men.
It's on the record.

640
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,290
Women took more money to train,
had more accidents.

641
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,591
They can't hack it in the sky.

642
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,320
Enough, Scotty.

643
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,150
Get some air.

644
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,420
Yes, ma'am.

645
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,040
I apologize for my partner.

646
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,660
I know what it's like.

647
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,130
You show one crack...

648
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,210
Wolves tear you to pieces.

649
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,020
Yeah.

650
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,660
I finished reading your book.

651
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,340
You fought hard for those girls.

652
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,530
Had to fly every month
to Mitchell Field

653
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:17,731
to file a report
with General Stockton.

654
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,990
Orders to keep him in the loop.

655
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,340
Made him see how important
the WASP were to the country.

656
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,180
You said Viv might have had
a boyfriend in Manhattan ?

657
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,210
You still believe that ?

658
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,700
Gal could have been flying
a million different places.

659
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:34,201
How do I know ?

660
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,950
Now... Which bases are
north of Wilmington ?

661
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:48,920
Otis in Massachusetts;
Mitchell Field in Long Island.

662
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,410
So if she were flying
to Mitchell Field,

663
00:37:51,411 --> 00:37:54,311
what would her landmarks
have been ?

664
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:00,420
After all these years,
hard to remember.

665
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,180
But you flew it every month.

666
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,570
Listen,I don't know
what you're getting at...

667
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,060
Would Philly have been
a landmark ?

668
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,420
One of the landmarks, yes.

669
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:17,300
You know why Vivian would have
packed her Santiago Dress Blues ?

670
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,600
We found it in the bullet compartment.

671
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:25,330
Maybe she was going to see
someone important, like the general.

672
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,950
I led the search party for Vivian.

673
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,320
She was my best pilot.

674
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,550
Yeah, but the day Vivian left,

675
00:38:30,551 --> 00:38:32,351
you put out next month's flight
schedule.

676
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,620
Your best pilot wasn't on it.

677
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,600
And there's only one explanation
for that, Iris,

678
00:38:39,601 --> 00:38:43,401
is you knew that Vivian
wasn't coming back.

679
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,720
I fought for those girls.
You said it yourself.

680
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,690
But your program was
under attack,

681
00:38:48,691 --> 00:38:51,891
and men were looking
for any excuse to shut it down.

682
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,480
Heard some zipperheads

683
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:55,481
saying the only way to keep
us out of their jobs

684
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:57,582
was to knock us out of the sky.

685
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,930
Edna's "accident" was a crack...

686
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,290
If they knew men were
targeting us WASP,

687
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:05,091
it would've made headlines ;
we would've lost it all.

688
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,980
But Vivian wouldn't
stop till everyone knew.

689
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,180
You buried that report
for the greater good.

690
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,220
Women fly combat today
because of the WASP,

691
00:39:12,421 --> 00:39:14,221
because of what we did.

692
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,930
Little girls look up to me.

693
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:21,440
I speak for the WASP.
I speak for you.

694
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,900
I speak for Vivian.

695
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,700
She left me no choice.

696
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,730
MPs still haven't picked up Wolf.

697
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:40,060
There's no formal
investigation of Edna's crash.

698
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,520
Your point, Miss Lynn ?

699
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,840
You canned my report.

700
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,310
Do you know what'll happen
if they find out

701
00:39:46,311 --> 00:39:49,511
a man sabotaged a WASP plane ;
How this will look ?

702
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,260
It'll look like
what it is-- murder.

703
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,710
They're fighting a war, Vivian.

704
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:57,200
You know how they'll fix this ?
They'll shut us down.

705
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,740
That's what you're worried
about-- the program ?

706
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,280
What about Edna ?

707
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,700
Edna is gone.

708
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,410
There is nothing we can do
to bring her back, Vivian.

709
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,020
Our job now is to take
care of all the WASP.

710
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,670
If the program is shut down,
we all have to stop flying.

711
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,050
You'll never fly that jet.

712
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,430
Edna deserves justice.

713
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:24,420
She would do the same for me ;
for all of us.

714
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:28,090
No one needs to know that you
illegally covered up my report,

715
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:31,791
if you send it up the chain today.

716
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:47,670
You're right. I don't know
what I was thinking.

717
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,530
Go to Mitchell Field.

718
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,910
Tell Stockton in person
what happened to Edna.

719
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,030
General Stockton, ma'am ?

720
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,320
Don't ever let it be said
I don't look out for my girls.

721
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,780
Thank you, ma'am.

722
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,770
Vivian.

723
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,790
Going to need your Santiago Blues.

724
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,120
Yes,ma'am.

725
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,640
Happy landings... always.

726
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:30,259

*And I'll be there *

744

745
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,680
*And send your love and your kisses *

746
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,650
