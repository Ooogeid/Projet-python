00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
THE FOLLOWING STORY IS FICTIONAL AND DOES
NOT DEPICT ANY ACTUAL PERSON OR EVENT.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,600
Hey, Pops.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,800
I got the money.
I just left it up in my room.MARCH 15, 2009

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
I'll fetch it.
FIVE MINUTES AGO.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,300
Let me grab a tallboy
for the journey.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,100
No deal.

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,800
You know I'm good for it.

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,200
That's not the point.

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,400
You can barely stay
upright as it is.

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,100
What you care?

11
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,200
Long as you get paid.

12
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, Landry, come on.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,200
What kind of man would I be
if I let one of my loyal
customers go out

14
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,300
in the dead of winter
with a half a load on?

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,500
I take full responsibility.

16
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,900
It's not happening.

17
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,200
I tell you what.

18
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll spot you a cup
of coffee for the road.

19
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,700
You can give me the
two bits in the AM.

20
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,200
You're welcome.

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,400
Landry, I done told you,
I'm not serving you tonight.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,400
Don't even think about it.

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,200
Oh, come on.

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,900
How about some Talk radio?

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sports, politics.
Anything but this.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,700
Now, you're talking
about the Temptations.

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,500
And it's freaking depressing.

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,300
Somebody always crying
about losing their girl
or their house.

29
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,800
I don't need to hear it.

30
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,800
I'm living it.

31
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,400
You got no culture.

32
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,500
If I admit it,
will you turn it off?

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,900
No.

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,700
What now?

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,000
Out of milk.

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,300
We'll get some in the morning.

37
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,200
We just worked a double.

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
Well, you should have
considered that

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,900
before you finished off
the last half-gallon.

40
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,200
Anyone here?

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,300
Hello?

42
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,500
Will?!

43
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,900
WILL?

44
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,100
Where the hell are you?!

45
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,500
Oh, God.

46
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,700
This is Detective Vera.

47
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,900
Officer down.
Officer down!

48
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,800
Grocery store,
Fifth and Main.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,300
I need rescue!

50
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,400
Rush.

51
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,600
Sweetheart.

52
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Wake up, angel.

53
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,400
Come on, baby.
Wake up. Come on.

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,100
We're going to Grandma's, okay?

55
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,600
I got to work tonight.

56
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,700
- Close enough to your place?
- Sure.

57
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,200
Sorry I can't walk you.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,200
Well, maybe we can
do this again.

59
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,400
BP is 50/33.

60
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,500
Respiratory distress.
Prep for intubation.

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,100
Anything I need to know
about this patient?

62
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,300
Allergies,
 medical conditions,
prescriptions?

63
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,600
I don't... I could find out.

64
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
No time.

65
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,000
Is he going to be okay?

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,100
Nick?

67
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,300
I drank all the damn milk.

71
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,300
I spoke to the paramedics.

72
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,100
Two victims.

73
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,100
Store owner, Henry Walters.
Goes by Pops.

74
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,900
Yeah, other one's a cop.
What's their condition?

75
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,100
Multiple gunshot wounds.

76
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,400
Taken to Saint Paul's.
One expired on the table.

77
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,200
Which one?

78
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,500
- Um.
- The cop or the owner?

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Come on.

80
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,000
Walters.
It was definitely Walters.

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,600
What about Jeffries?

82
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,700
The cop.

83
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,300
???

84
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,800
Call comes in.
I'm first on the scene.

85
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,600
- What did you see?
- Not much.

86
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,000
Detective shot on the floor.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,700
- His partner, big guy.
- Vera?

88
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,800
Yeah. Points me
out the back.

89
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
I made chase, but the shooter
is in the wind.

90
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,900
Robbery?

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This area? Robbery, drug deal,
gang retribution.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,100
Your guy walks in.

93
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,700
Wrong place, wrong time.

94
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,600
- Yeah.
- Witnesses?

95
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,400
Deaf, dumb, and blind.

96
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,900
I need details!

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,300
You saw something,
heard something,

98
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,500
know something,

99
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,800
step up now.

100
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,500
Oh, this is funny to you?

101
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,900
Cop got shot, jag-off.

102
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,300
Toss him in the wagon.

103
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,700
You worried
about being a snitch?

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
That crap ends here.

105
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,200
Or we'll waterboard your ass
if we got to.

106
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,100
We're going to find out
what happened.

107
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,000
Hey.

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,100
Hey, hey, you.
Come here.

109
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
What's your name?

110
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,200
Landry. I ain't seen nothing.

111
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,700
You know the store,
right, Landry?

112
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,500
Pops was real good to me.

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,100
He had a special place
in HIS heart for screw-ups.

114
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,500
You been drinking
tonight, Landry?

115
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,600
I don't see why tonight

116
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,700
would be different
than any other.

117
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,300
I likes my beer.

118
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,900
How's about a case?

119
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,500
I heard a gun go off.

120
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,600
One shot.

121
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,900
Then two more.

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,300
How long between the shots?

123
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,100
Was it "bang,"
then "bang-bang"?

124
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,500
I was crossing the street
when I heard the first shot.

125
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
When the others came,

126
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,800
I was like a whole
'nother block away.

127
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,800
You'll get your cash
back at the station.

128
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Come on.

129
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,700
Him, too.

130
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,900
Detective Jeffries' family?

131
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,500
Haven't been able
to reach his sister, so...

132
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,600
How is he?

133
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,000
He was shot twice
in the back.

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,600
One bullet lodged
in the ribcage.

135
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,200
- How bad?
- Missed his vital organs.

136
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,500
We removed it
without incident.

137
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,000
- The other bullet? 
- Punctured a lung, which collapsed.

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,200
As soon as he's stabilized,
we'll get him out of trauma and MOVE HIM INTO SURGERY.

139
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,600
What's it looking like?

140
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,100
A long night.

141
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,500
Put me on the street, boss.

142
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,500
Let me find the scumbag
who shot Will.

143
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,500
You're in no condition, Nick.

144
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,800
I'm telling you...

145
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
all the training,

146
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,900
nothing can prepare you
for when it all goes down.

147
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,300
TWO HOURS AGO,
This is Detective Vera.

148
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,200
Officer down.
Officer down!

149
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,400
Grocery store, Fifth and Main.

150
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,900
I need rescue!

151
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,100
Hold on, buddy.
Hold on.

152
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,600
Got to apply pressure
to that wound.

153
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,300
Police! Who's there?!

154
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,300
I'm a cop!
I'm a cop!

155
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,500
Someone went out the back.

156
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Just one?

157
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,800
I don't know.

158
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,200
You hold on, buddy, okay?

159
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,900
You hold on. I'm here. I'm here.

160
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,600
I'm going to apply pressure
to this wound, okay?

161
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,700
HOLD ON.

162
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,100
Cop must have been a block away
when the call came in.

163
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,500
Did you get a look
at the shooter?

164
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,500
What about before
you went in the store?

165
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,800
You notice anyone?

166
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,900
You hear anything?

167
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,400
The first gunshot, maybe?

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,200
Nothing.

169
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
So, he was in the store
when you pulled up.

170
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,900
Pops was already shot.

171
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,400
What was he doing in there?

172
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
He wasn't robbing the place.
Cash in the till.

173
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,100
Pops' watch and wallet were on him
when he reached the hospital.

174
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,500
Maybe the shooter was looking
for something else.

175
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,800
Three shell casings.
Nine-millimeter.

176
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,600
Will comes in.

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,400
Goes for the milk.

178
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,200
Shooter jumps up.

179
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,500
Opens fire.

180
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,900
Bloody footprints say
the doer  runs out the back.

181
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,500
'Cause Vera's
coming in the front.

182
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,800
He kicks open the back door,
takes off down the alley.

183
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,100
Got video surveillance up front.

184
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,700
It's back here, too.

185
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,200
Tapes haven't been touched
in years.

186
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,600
Here's hoping they still play.

187
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,800
I've met this girl.

188
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,500
ONE WEEK AGO

189
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,700
Valentine's out
there somewhere.

190
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,800
Who knows what he'll do?

191
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,100
What happened, Carmen?

192
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,700
They had some kind
of argument.

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,100
I've never seen Pops so angry.

194
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,000
You know the old man.

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
He don't back down
for nothing.

196
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,000
Neither does Valentine.

197
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,100
You should have seen
the look in his eyes.

198
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,100
Okay.

199
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,600
- Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
- I'll take care of it.

200
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,700
Okay?

201
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
We just found Pops' next of kin.
GRANDPA AND CARMEN GRADUATION 2006

202
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,000
Carmen comes to Will

203
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,300
'cause she's worried
about this Valentine.

204
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,700
Will was here for a whole lot
more than milk.

205
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
Wait, what kind of gun?

206
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,900
No, no, look.

207
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,100
Tell your snitch we're looking
for a nine-millimeter.

208
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Yep.

209
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,100
Any news?

210
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,900
They moved him
up to surgery.

211
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,500
Need blood?

212
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
- Something like that?
- No. They're good, Scotty.

213
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
You okay?

214
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,200
Sorry.

215
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Tip line's overwhelmed. Some
schmuck gives my number instead.

216
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,200
- What do you got?
- Putting the screws to known stick-up men,

217
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
LOCAL DEARLERS AND BANGERS,

218
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,700
but it's looking like Will was
in the store for a reason.

219
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,100
- He knew Pops?
- Might have been some kind of falling out

220
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,400
between Pops and a guy
goes by the name Valentine.

221
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,000
What kind of falling out?

222
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm hoping Pops' granddaughter
Carmen can fill in the blanks.

223
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,900
Neighbor said she's a student
over at Temple.

224
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,100
Miller's bringing her in.

225
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,700
You checking the system
for Valentine?

226
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,100
Wait a minute, that name.

227
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,600
No, Detective Jeffries
is not here.

228
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,900
What time's the kid
getting arraigned?

229
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,100
Yeah. "Valentine"? Got it.

230
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,500
I'll make sure he gets it.

231
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,600
Cop on the other line said
Valentine was up on a gun charge.

232
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,200
But he was holding off on filing
till Jeffries called him back.

233
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,800
Would this connect
to a case?

234
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,400
Not that I know of.

235
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,300
Maybe he's got a phone number
for Valentine in his things.

236
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,800
He win a bet or something?

237
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,500
Will never carries
more than a couple bucks.

238
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,900
No Valentine in here.

239
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,100
We get a description at least?

240
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,800
I mean, that cop,
that first responder,

241
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,400
he get a look at the doer
when he went after him?

242
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,300
McGinley? No.

243
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Pete McGinley?

244
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Yeah. You know
him, boss?

245
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,500
He went to PPD
to sort out witnesses.

246
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,900
Colleague of mine works
the felony unit.

247
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Said he was preparing a
complaint for a James Valentine

248
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,500
on handgun possession
a couple months ago.

249
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,700
What happened?

250
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
He's on his way to court,
gets a call from the arresting officer, ???

251
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,400
HE MADE A MISTAKE.

252
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,900
Your buddy get
the officer's name?

253
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,100
Yeah. Kendrick.

254
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,500
Works the Fifth Distct..

255
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,800
I need you to find an Officer
Kendrick at the Fifth District.

256
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't care where he is.
Get him down here.

257
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,300
Does this James Valentine
got a record?

258
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,400
Nothing recent.

259
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,300
All juvenile.

260
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,800
Records are sealed.

261
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,500
Yeah. Not anymore.

262
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,900
How'd you get these unsealed
at 3:00 in the morning?

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,200
Uh, you, uh...
you really want to know?

264
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,800
Assault,
robbery, shoplifting.

265
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,700
Valentine was 17 last time he was
in front of a judge.

266
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,200
He got a choice.

267
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,600
Hard prison time
or military service.

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
He chose Uncle Sam.

269
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,100
Since then he's stayed
out of trouble.

270
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,400
Until now.

271
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
???

272
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,000
I stay until we charge someone
for shooting a cop.

273
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,500
Your dad.

274
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
Appreciate it.

275
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,000
EXCUSE ME.

276
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,700
Scotty...

277
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,300
I'm sorry about Jeffries.

278
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,900
Is he going to be okay?

279
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,700
It's too soon to tell.

280
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,500
If you want to talk or...

281
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,300
Did ya get anything off
the security video FROM POP'S STORE?

282
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,300
Tape from the front door
is useless.

283
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,300
The one from the back
is deteriorated.

284
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,000
Thinking binder
breakdown.

285
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,800
Some TLC, I might be able
to rescue it.

286
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,600
TLC's your specialty, ain't it?

287
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,200
It's not so
funny now, huh?

288
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,300
Scotty, what's up?

289
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,300
Naw, just,
you know, Will.

290
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,400
He's still in surgery...

291
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,900
Yeah.

292
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,300
You heading over there?

293
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Maybe later.

294
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,100
I just spoke to the cop who arrested
Valentine for gun possession.

295
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,700
Couple months back,

296
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,100
Valentine gets pulled
over for running a light.

297
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,400
.38 in the glove box.

298
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,600
We got an address for him?

299
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,700
We broke down the door.
No one home.

300
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,400
But left a small army to
bring him in if he shows up.

301
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,800
How's Jeffries fige inin?

302
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,400
Well, he asked Kendrick
for a personal favor;

303
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,800
letting Valentine
off the hook.

304
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,300
Will's not the type
to bend the rules.

305
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,200
Won't even take
a free cup of coffee.

306
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,500
Makes you wonder what
Valentine means to him.

307
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,400
Follow me.

308
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Valens tells me
you been a help.

309
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Doing what I can.

310
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,900
Where do you live,
McGinley?

311
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,300
Gray's Ferry.

312
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,500
That's a long way
from Pops' store.

313
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,200
Happy accident you being so close
when the shooting went down?

314
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,600
My night off. I can't sleep.
I like to drive.

315
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,400
Make a habit of driving
an unmarked city vehicle

316
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,000
with a police radio into the ghetto
on your night off?

317
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,500
I know two things about you,
McGinley.

318
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,200
One: when you were in uniform
you were Deputy Commissioner

319
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
???

320
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,100
And two: when you made
detective,

321
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,700
he had you transferred
to Internal Affairs.

322
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,600
But what I don't know
is what the hell you were doing

323
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,800
following one
of my detectives around.

324
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,400
A couple of months ago,
JeJeries fixed a gun charge on a convicted felon.

325
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,800
If he did, he had his reasons.

326
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,600
Yeah, and I know
what they were.

327
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
YESTERDAY.

328
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,300
You got no idea what you saw.

329
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,400
Come on, Lieutenant.

330
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,500
He gets Valentine out of a jam.

331
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,800
A few weeks later,
he's collecting his bonus.

332
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,500
Probably got him shot.

333
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,900
Get out of here.

334
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,000
Go back to Doherty.

335
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,200
I'm a cop first.

336
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,500
I want to help.

337
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,300
You're not welcome here.

338
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,300
Pops'd bring in
the troubled kids.

339
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,800
Ones who put up
the biggest front.

340
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,800
Give 'em a job.
Try to school 'em.

341
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,400
You know where
Valentine is now, Carmen?

342
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,400
There was an argument about week ago,
over money, I think.

343
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,800
Pops hit him.
Valentine ran off.

344
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,500
I told Pops, "Get out
of the neighborhood. "

345
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,500
He said these kids'd be lost
without him.

346
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,100
Valentine's not
at his apartment.

347
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,600
You know where else he could be?

348
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,500
He works nights.

349
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,100
A restaurant, I think.

350
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Which one?

351
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What kind of food? Burgers?

352
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Tacos?

353
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,800
What am I going to do now?

354
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,300
Pops looked out for me.
He was my only family.

355
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,400
All these cops here,
they're ready to move.

356
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,900
Find the guy
who shot your grandfather.

357
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,200
But we need your help.

358
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,100
Can I see him?

359
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,800
I'll take you to the hospital,
soon as we're done.

360
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,500
Chicken.

361
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,300
It's a chicken place
on Susqie.

362
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,000
SUSQIE, YEAH, LET'S GO.

363
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,400
Kid's been here all night.

364
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
I would never hurt Pops!

365
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,700
Word on the street is
you're the dangerous type.

366
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,200
Got the record to prove it.

367
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,400
That was the past, man.
I've changed.

368
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,200
A gun you were pulled over with
a few weeks ago

369
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,000
SAYS DIFFERENT.

370
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,500
Gun wasn't even for me!

371
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,100
That gun was for Pops.

372
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,500
A kid comes to me.
He said he wants $50 a week.

373
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,200
Protection, he tells me.

374
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,100
I tell him to just go.

375
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,500
But he came back, didn't he?

376
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,900
Acting tough,
knocking stuff over.

377
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,000
Ain't no act.

378
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,400
The Dominicans play for keeps.

379
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,300
They already took over
the drug trade.

380
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,000
How you going to stand tall?

381
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,600
Kids is kids.

382
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,900
You were just like that
not too long ago.

383
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,600
Look at you now.

384
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,100
Put a quarter down there.

385
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,200
Pops, I was going to pay
for it, man.

386
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm just saying the neighborhood's changed
since my day.

387
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,800
Your day?

388
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,400
Your day was three years ago.

389
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,400
This is another punk who thinks he's the baddest ass
in the neighborhood.

390
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,700
You the boss.

391
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,500
It's good
you remembered that.

392
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,100
SNITCH

393
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,700
What the hell?

394
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,900
It's a prank.

395
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,900
Nah, this ain't
no prank, Pops.

396
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,400
Man, we got to get you
some real protection.

397
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,800
What, a gun?

398
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,500
I been running this store
for 40 years.

399
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,700
I stood my ground.

400
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,100
And I didn't need no gun
to do it.

401
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Name's Francisco Ariza.

402
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
He's the first guy that
ever got under Pops' skin.

403
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,200
Your brilliant idea
to get a gun.

404
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,900
That why you
and Pops argued?

405
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,000
Somebody had to stand up
to Francisco.

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,900
And I needed money to do it.

407
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,000
- To buy another gun.
- Damn straight.

408
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,500
I was going to persuade
that Dominican son of a bitch to stay 
away FROM THE OLD MAN

409
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,400
Your man Jeffries stops me
before I get it.

410
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,600
at the roll of cash Jeffries
took from you yesterday?

411
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,800
I stole it from Pops.

412
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,000
Your man must have been bringing
it back to him when he got shot.

413
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,700
Are we square?

414
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,800
No, we ain't square.

415
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,400
You tell us where
to find Francisco.

416
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Then do us all a favor:
stop being so helpful.

417
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,700
How long's it take to get
a ballistics report?!

418
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,200
No, I'm done talking to you!

419
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,100
I want Carla on the phone now!

420
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,200
Hung up.

421
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,000
Everyone's doing
what they can, Nick.

422
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,900
- They pick up Valentine yet?
- Alibi'd out.

423
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,600
The gun he had
was for protecting Pops

424
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,200
from a local banger,
Francisco Ariza.

425
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,200
- Let's go get him.
- It's being handled.

426
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
When was the last time
you slept?

427
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,200
They been working on Will
for hours.

428
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,300
I need to do something
for him, boss.

429
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,200
Come on.

430
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,800
What the hell am I
supposed to do here?

431
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,700
Will?

432
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,600
No news.

433
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,400
I saw you praying,
I figured...

434
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,800
He's holding on.

435
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,100
I got a record
for FrANciscO Ariza.

436
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,700
Runs with Mara Este.

437
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,400
Carjacking, gun possession, extortion.

438
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,600
Gang's hard-core.

439
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,700
Francisco's been shaking down local businesses
for protection money.

440
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,800
But Pops wouldn't pay.

441
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,100
So Francisco makes him
an example for the rest
of the neighborhood?

442
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,600
Do we know where he is?

443
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,400
Last known address
was his mother's.

444
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,700
She died four years ago.
When Francisco's not locked up,

445
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,600
he's with a girlfriend
in West Kensington.

446
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,500
We got anything we can
bring hiin with?

447
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,900
Open bench warrant:
possession with intent.

448
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,500
Rush and Valens are on it.

449
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,900
- If they're lucky, he tries to run. 
- Shh!

450
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,600
Hey, buddy, listen,
shush me again,

451
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,900
and I'll take your tongue
and I'll shove it...!

452
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,600
Nick,

453
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,800
let it go.

454
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,200
What is it with people?

455
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,400
It's a chapel.

456
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,800
He's going to be okay.

457
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Nothing.

458
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,600
Coffee's still on.

459
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,600
Someone was here
not too long ago.

460
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Landlord said the
girlfriend's out of town.

461
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
Maybe Francisco went for smokes?

462
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,600
I don't think he's coming back.

463
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,900
I'll call Bell
for a search warrant.

464
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,300
I'll wake the judge.

465
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,100
Heard on the radio about a homicide detective
getting shot.

466
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,600
He a friend of yours?

467
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,300
Name's Will Jeffries.

468
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,700
I've known him a while now.

469
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,200
He going to pull through?

470
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,000
That's what they're saying.

471
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,200
Anyway, I guess I just wanted
to see your face.

472
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,700
Okay.

473
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,800
I want you to have this.

474
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,000
???

475
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,000
If you're anything like me,

476
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,800
you don't go in for spiritual
mumbo-jumbo.

477
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,000
Still...

478
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,400
it's given me comfort

479
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,000
during some hard times.

480
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,500
Uh, thanks.

481
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,000
Be careful out there, okay?

482
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,600
Yeah, sure.

483
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,300
Who's that?

484
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,700
My father.

485
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
Cooper.

486
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,600
Yeah.

487
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Heard about Will, wanted
to make sure I'm all right.

488
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah.

489
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,800
Tells me,

490
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,100
"Be careful. "

491
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,500
No idea the same thing
happened to me.

492
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Funny, right?

493
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,600
Where you going?

494
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,500
Hospital.

495
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,400
FBI tracked Francisco's
cell phone GPS for you.

496
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,800
What is it, 7:00 a. m.?

497
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,800
Never known Feds to be
so quick on the uptake.

498
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,500
Eh, special agent in
charge owes me money.

499
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,300
Can't play Hold 'em
to save his life.

500
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,100
Signal traces to the
Marshall housing projects.

501
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,500
That's two blocks
from Pops' store.

502
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,900
Hey, listen,
do me a favor.

503
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,500
Don't take it easy on him.

504
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,800
That's a promise.

505
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,500
Francisco doesn't
live here.

506
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Kind of hard to believe, seeing as 
we found your nephew's cell phone 
ON THE KITCHEN TABLE.

507
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,800
He left it

508
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,000
last time he came by.

509
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,400
That was a few days ago.

510
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,500
I been sick all week.

511
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,000
I got the
bronchitis.

512
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,000
He hasn't
been back.

513
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,500
But he made a call yesterday?
How's that happen?

514
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,200
No idea.

515
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,800
Okay, this number
belongs to his girlfriend.

516
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,100
- What about the others?
- How should I know?

517
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,700
Look, I want you
out of my apartment.

518
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,700
I got my rights!

519
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,900
I'll give you a right.
And a couple lefts, too,

520
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,600
if you don't start
talking straight.

521
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,900
Hey, that was my mother's!

522
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,700
We don't give a rat's ass
about the FURNITURE.

523
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,700
We want Francisco.

524
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,900
How about you,
Gabriel?

525
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,100
I don't know where he is.

526
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,900
I'd say the same thing
to protect my older brother.

527
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,400
But the best way to help is
telling me how to find him.

528
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,700
A lot of cops out there pissed
off 'cause of what he did.

529
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
They're not going
to consider his well-being.

530
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,600
But... I'll guarantee
his safety.

531
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
One younger brother
to another.

532
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,700
I'm not telling you nothing!

533
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,500
Old man got what he deserved.

534
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,400
FIVE DAYS AGO.

535
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,500
You get the number
or what?

536
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,300
All right, what you want, man?

537
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,300
You want some chips,
some popcorn or what?

538
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,800
Can I get both?

539
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,800
Yeah. Take them.

540
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,400
You going to pay
for that?

541
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,400
Consider it an advance
on the money you owe me.

542
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,400
50 a week.

543
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,900
You listen, Boricua...

544
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,300
I ain't no Boricua, man.

545
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm Dominican.

546
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,600
What you are is a disrespectful
little pissant.

547
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,700
Didn't your father
teach you respect?

548
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,300
Yo, don't talk about
my father, man.

549
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,800
Well, let me guess.

550
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,500
Your daddy ran off and he got
lost in a crack pipe, killed?

551
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Ain't no version of that
I haven't heard.

552
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,000
It's no excuse.

553
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,900
You think you're a big man
because you hustle honest folks ???

554
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,600
You're a fool.

555
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,500
Spend your time
playing tough,

556
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,100
dodging bullets.

557
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,700
For what?!

558
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,800
A fat roll?!

559
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,900
It doesn't matter.

560
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,400
You're still going to be dead or
in jail by the time you're 25.

561
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,300
Now, me...

562
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,600
I pay minimum wage.

563
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,800
And I make you earn it.

564
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,900
But it's honest.

565
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,000
And it'll give you something
your thugging never did:
 a future.

566
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,200
You got the stones
to work for that?

567
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,700
Are you man enough TO SEND
example for this young one here?

568
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Nah.

569
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,700
You ain't nothing.

570
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,800
You put that stuff down,

571
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,100
and you get the hell
out of my store.

572
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,000
Old man shouldn't
have said that.

573
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,300
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW MY BROTHER.

574
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,900
Yeah, and Francisco
shouldn't have shot him.

575
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,600
- Screw you!
- Tell me where he is,

576
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,700
or I put you and auntie here in cuffs,
toss youse in a cell.

577
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,300
I don't know.

578
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,600
Right. Come on.

579
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,800
Come on.

580
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,800
Hear our man's going
to make a full recovery.

581
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,400
Came here as soon as I could.

582
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,200
You found time to put
on the dress blues.

583
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,800
I want to convey to Detective Jeffries
the thanks of a grateful city.

584
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,500
News cameras are
downstairs, Pat.

585
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,500
You're too cynical, John.

586
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,200
This from the guy who investigates
one of my detectives

587
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,500
because Grover Boone's got
a personal beef with me.

588
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,100
IAB has a legitimate reason to
investigate Detective Jeffries.

589
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,200
Well, not anymore.

590
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,600
Tell Boone
Jeffries wasn't on the take.

591
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,200
He was retrieving stolen
property, and I got proof.

592
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,800
For the record,

593
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,400
it isn't Councilman Boone
who has the beef.

594
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
I don't like the way
you do things.

595
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,900
Frankly,
I don't like you, John.

596
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,200
Never have.

597
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,500
That's fine, Pat.

598
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,000
But you ever mess with someone
under my command again...

599
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,400
What'll you do, John?

600
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,600
I will beat
the ever-loving crap out of you.

601
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,100
Feel like you got
hit by a bus, huh?

602
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,800
It's more like a freight train.

603
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,700
Pops?

604
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,700
He was a friend of yours, huh?

605
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,500
He was more than that.

606
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,800
You're not going
to buy nothing today?

607
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,800
Just looking.

608
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,500
Did that beer just
fall in your pocket?

609
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,800
Boy, you been
robbing me blind for months.

610
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,100
I'm sick of it.

611
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,100
I see you hanging out
on the streets,

612
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,900
giving your mother a hard time,

613
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,500
bullying those other kids.

614
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,800
Call the cops on me.

615
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Son, you owe
me $79.27.

616
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,200
I ain't got no money.

617
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,000
Then you're going
to work it off.

618
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,800
I know your father left,
and it's tough times.

619
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,500
But I tell you what,
I don't care.

620
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
You're a man now.

621
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,300
You got a man's choice.

622
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,200
Take this broom
and start earning

623
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,500
or get ready for the whupping
of your young life.

624
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,200
I took that broom,
worked there every day.

625
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,600
He was the one got me into football,
straightened me out.

626
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,900
You think he would've
given you that whupping?

627
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,000
Without a doubt.

628
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,600
Pops is...

629
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,600
was...

630
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,500
pretty mean
when he wanted to be.

631
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,700
I don't know what the neighborhood's
going to do without him.

632
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,700
You up to talking
about the case?

633
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,900
Yeah.

634
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,400
Recognize him?

635
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,500
Ah, Francisco Ariza.

636
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,100
He the one who shot you?

637
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
I didn't see
who shot me.

638
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:04,600
But this guy's been giving Pops trouble
for a long time,

639
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,200
shaking him down.

640
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,700
You knew about that?

641
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,200
Yeah.

642
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,700
This whole thing
with Pops and Valentine,

643
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,300
we could've helped you
with that.

644
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,300
Some roads
you got to travel alone.

645
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,900
Been turning over every rock
looking for this kid.

646
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,000
Aunt's house, local hangouts,
his girlfriend's place...

647
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,200
Girlfriend?

648
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,400
Which one?

649
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,300
??? ARIZA,

650
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,700
??? VALENTINE.

651
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,500
Now we square.

652
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
This way.

653
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,800
Valentine dropped his gun.

654
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Was just sitting here
when the cops came in.

655
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,900
What size were the shoes
we pulled out of the trash can?

656
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,700
Was average.

657
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,900
Nine, ten maybe.

658
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,500
Those look average size to you?

659
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,400
Valentine shot the wrong guy.

660
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,500
Doer's still out there.

661
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,500
Well, Will Jeffries spent a lot of time
keeping you out of trouble.

662
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,400
Fixed it when you got
caught with a gun

663
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,600
and stopped you
from buying another.

664
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,200
So where'd you get
this one from?

665
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,400
Luther's Chicken.

666
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,200
Manager keeps it in his office
in case we get robbed.

667
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,900
You turned your life around,
Valentine.

668
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,500
You made something of yourself.

669
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,000
And you just threw it away.

670
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,500
I warned Francisco.

671
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,700
Stay away from Pops!

672
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,400
He laughed at me!

673
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,800
And y'all ain't lift
a finger to help.

674
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,900
Somebody had to make him pay.

675
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,400
You screwed up, though.

676
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,100
'Cause you killed the wrong guy.

677
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,300
Get out of here, wrong guy.

678
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,800
Francisco killed Pops!

679
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,900
- Cold!
- Why are you so sure?

680
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,400
'Cause he told me!

681
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,600
Get in there!

682
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,500
Whoa, wait, hold on, man.

683
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,800
Put the gun down, yo!

684
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,400
<i>- You just couldn't leave Pops alone! 
- Que haces?!</i>

685
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,800
Why'd you got to go
and kill him?!

686
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,900
I been here all night,
all right?

687
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,300
Look, ask her
if you don't believe me.

688
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,400
He's been here all night,
okay, papa! He's been here!

689
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,700
Why should I believe you, man?

690
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,000
Why should I believe you?!

691
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,600
Get in there.
Come on. Get in there.

692
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,800
Get in there! Get in there!

693
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,400
Look, man, I'm sorry, okay?

694
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,900
- It was a mistake!
- A mistAKE?

695
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,400
Huh? What's that
supposed to mean?

696
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,100
Just look, you got it all wrong.

697
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,100
All right, man, look,
we got to be men about this.

698
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,600
- We got to work this out.
- Calm down, papa!

699
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,700
Where were you at midnight?

700
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,300
Answer me!

701
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,400
That's what I thought.

702
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,200
No! No, no, no!

703
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,000
He got what he deserved.

704
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,200
Got the footprints
at the murder scene.

705
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,900
Shoes and a shirt
the killer wore.

706
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,700
None of them
match Francisco.

707
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,300
You understand what I'm saying?

708
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,300
He was as innocent
as you.

709
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,500
And now he's as dead as Pops.

710
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,300
No, no, no.

711
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,800
You're going to have a lot of time
to think on that in prison.

712
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,000
Why he ain't just tell me then? Hmm?

713
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,300
Hey, hey, hey.

714
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,700
I want to apologize
for the way I acted before.

715
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,500
My buddy was in a bad way
for a while.

716
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,800
It's no excuse.

717
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,000
But he pulled through.

718
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,600
I was way out of line.

719
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,400
You got every right to take
a swing at me if you want.

720
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,100
I hope everything's okay
with your loved ones, too.

721
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,100
Don't want to talk about it,
that's cool.

722
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,300
Nick?

723
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,200
When was the last time
you slept?

724
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,900
I'm really getting the hang
of this, uh, prayer thing.

725
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,400
Just don't set off
the smoke alarm.

726
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,100
Did you see Will?

727
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,900
Yeah.

728
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Hey, why don't you go home, huh?

729
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,800
Catch some Zs.

730
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,900
I'll stay here.

731
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,600
It's Will's place.

732
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,700
Not mine.

733
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,100
Wouldn't feel right.

734
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,200
Him being here,
me being there.

735
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,400
Well, anytime something
like this happens...

736
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,900
It's part of the job;
we all know that.

737
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,300
But you just never think...

738
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,300
I mean...

739
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,200
I don't know.

740
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,900
Yeah.

741
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,700
Me, too.

742
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,200
Video was in bad shape.

743
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,900
Polyurethane from the tape
absorbed water.

744
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,000
I had to go in
and dry it by hand.

745
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,000
Literally baked the tape
with a hairdryer..

746
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,900
and a bunch of other stuff
you guys don't care about.

747
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,600
Here's what I got.

748
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,900
This is from a few hours
before the shooting.

749
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,900
Good job, Frankie.

750
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,600
- YEAH.
- Yeah, thanks.

751
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,400
Francisco and Pops made peace?

752
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,100
He all but took
responsibility

753
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,700
for Pops' murder
with his dying breath.

754
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,500
Protecting someone?

755
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,100
Who?

756
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,500
I know who.

757
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,500
Hey.

758
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,200
Where's the kid
who was in here?

759
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,600
Gabriel?
I told you to watch him.

760
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,700
Cut him loose.

761
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,600
His brother died;
no need to keep him.

762
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Right?

763
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,600
Open up! Police!

764
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,300
Let's see
your hands, Gabriel.

765
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Gun!

766
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,200
Scotty?

767
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,300
I'm okay.

768
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,800
You're making a mistake,
Gabriel.

769
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,300
You killed my brother!

770
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,800
Put the damn gun down!

771
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,000
We didn't touch Francisco.

772
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,200
That's a lie!

773
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,900
You going to shoot my partner?
Is that the big plan here?

774
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,700
This isn't a game!

775
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,300
And those weren't
warning shots.

776
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,700
I won't miss again.

777
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,200
Listen to her, Gabriel.

778
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,000
This isn't what your
brother died for.

779
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,600
You don't know
about my brother!

780
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,400
I know Francisco
was smart.

781
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,500
He made peace with Pops.

782
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,100
Wanted this feud
to end.

783
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,800
NO. He hated that old man.

784
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,700
Maybe.

785
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,200
But he knew
Pops was right.

786
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,100
He took that job.

787
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,900
No!

788
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,000
You figure he'd be proud
of you for killing Pops?

789
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,900
Shooting my friend?
I mean, think about it.

790
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,500
9 HOURS AGO

791
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,900
What happened?

792
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,700
What happened?!

793
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,100
Gabriel, what happened?
What'd you do?

794
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,400
What have you done?!

795
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,600
- No, no! 
- Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?

796
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,200
Francisco was looking
out for you.

797
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,100
It's what a man does.

798
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,900
He took a bullet so
you could have a life.

799
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,400
Don't let it end here.

800
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Be a man.

801
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,100
I don't need an excuse
to take you out.

802
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,700
I want to.

803
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,800
Give me a reason not to.

804
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,100
All clear.

805
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Come on.

806
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,900
Gonna need an ambulance.

807
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,100
You got to believe me.

808
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,300
I didn't mean it.

809
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,900
10 HOURS AGO

810
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,800
I told you, Landry.

811
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,500
I'm not serving you tonight.

812
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,900
Anyone here?

813
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,300
Hello?

814
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,500
Will?! Will?!

815
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,800
