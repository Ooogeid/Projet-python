3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,280
September 27,1981

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,170
Damn!

5
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,050
Hey,got any glazed in there,Donna?

6
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,400
You got any fries with that shake,baby?

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,690
That's funny,Bruce.

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,170
I just heard a guy say that...

9
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,480
to your mother at
the drive-thru window.

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,430
Oh,yeah?

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,080
All right,listen up.

12
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,500
End of the month,fellas.Crunch time.

13
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,170
Gotta move some serious steel
before the new inventory arrives.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,730
Top man on the board...

15
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,000
...gets a fat bonus: $1,500 cash.

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,590
Bottom fish?You don't
sell a car this weekend...

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,680
... hit the bricks.Or
you can get out now.

18
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,770
It's simple men: get...

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,270
them... in... the car.

20
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,230
Get 'em to,to smell it.

21
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,140
Then you get 'em to drive it.

22
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,990
Then you get 'em to buy it!

23
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,940
The feel of the wheel..

24
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,500
seals the deal!

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,900
The feel of the wheel.

26
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,640
Rice burners got us beat
on price and mileage,Mickey.

27
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,540
Yeah,we're busting our humps out there,

28
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,600
but we're losing loyal customers
with these new,uh,K-cars.

29
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,120
The cars?

30
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,120
The cars don't lose customers.

31
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,230
Lousy salesman do!

32
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,890
You think guys walk on this lot
because they're thinking about mileage?

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,050
Guys walk on this lot because they want
to buy American,to give us their money.

34
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,710
And you know what you do?

35
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,300
You take it,damn it!

36
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,990
Take it!

37
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,890
People want cars to project an image.

38
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,800
Cars to make 'em look
younger or more powerful.

39
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:15,600
Men want cars that women
just want to... ...get into.

40
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,010
Ain't that right,Donna?

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,560
Yeah,but I would have never got
knocked up at 17 in some K-car.

42
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,710
It ain't go no curves,no back seat.

43
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,990
Never take no for an answer!

44
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,410
Someone says they're just looking?

45
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,270
You tell 'em that's
how you met your wife.

46
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,460
What-what if they say they
have to check with the wife?

47
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,110
Then you tell 'em to
go get their pants back!

48
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,510
You get 'em in a box and
you close these bastards!

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,770
And if you can't do it,then
you find someone who can!

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,640
But you do not-- and I repeat-- you
do not let them walk out that door!

51
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,040
- Are we clear?
- Yeah!

52
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,920
- Are we clear?
- Yeah!

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,950
Shall we go sell some cars?

54
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,180
Let's go sell some cars.

55
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,620
Mickey!Mickey!

56
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,800
Can I talk to you a sec?

57
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,920
The phones aren't gonna
answer themselves,sweetheart.

58
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,490
I know,it's just,um,things are
real tight for me right now.

59
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,440
Oh,looking for an advance?

60
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,610
Just for this week.

61
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,260
But I'm ready to take on more.

62
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,500
That's great.

63
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,250
I'll tell you,why don't you start
by cleaning this mess up right here?

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,450
Look at it,pigsty right here.Look.

65
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,260
Classic car buff trolling for parts found more than
he bargained for in the trunk of this old beater.

66
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,980
Adult female?

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,580
Looks like blunt force
trauma to the skull.

68
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,570
The tire iron was in the trunk.

69
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,030
It's a '73 Eldorado.

70
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,370
Guy probably wanted the taillights.

71
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,050
Donna D'Amico,age 22,went
missing back in '81.

72
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,660
Anyone notify next of kin?

73
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,680
We're trying to locate her mother
who filed the missing persons report.

74
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,440
The car don't belong to her.

75
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,750
The keys don't fit.

76
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,140
And the VIN number plate's gone.

77
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,770
A '73.

78
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,230
Cars had confidential
VIN numbers that far back?

79
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,660
Should be buried in there somewhere.

80
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,430
It's probably on the frame
or under the engine block.

81
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,390
Whoever dumped her knew
what they were doing.

82
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,230
The fat slob at the gate said
they don't inspect cars at intake.

83
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,600
The place should advertise
to criminals: Dump-Jobs-R-Us.

84
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,890
Let's tow the car.

85
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,510
Let the Auto Squad take it apart
in the garage.hello is Stillman

86
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,320
What is it?

87
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,610
A scrap of paper with some
names and some numbers.

88
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,300
Still make out the ballpoint.

89
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,240
Lester,1,200 bucks.Somebody
she owed money?

90
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,060
The address at the top's faded out.

91
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,430
See if QD can pull it up?

92
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,380
I'll run the name Lester
against titles on '73 Eldorados.

93
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,380
Donna's mother passed
away eight years ago.

94
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,530
Only surviving next of
kin is her daughter,Marisa.

95
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,900
How old was she back in '81
when her mom disappeared?

96
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,550
Five.

97
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,920
I'll handle the notification.

98
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,980
It was a good thing we got
to her before the cruncher.

Donna D'Amicl,22-year-old single mom took the
bus to Steed Motors where she worked as a greeter.

103
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,580
Boss says she left at 7:00
P.M. the day she disappeared.

104
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,770
Never returned to pick up
her daughter from the sitter.

105
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,500
Witness statements back in '81?

106
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,990
Nothing indicating foul
play.Like she vanished.

107
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,610
Only after she emptied her
bank account: 400 bucks.

108
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,150
Any guys in the picture?

109
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:30,740
No husband,no degree,bad credit,crap
job with limited prospects.

110
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,320
Assigned figured she skipped town;
ditched the kid and a miserable situation.

111
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,490
- Wouldn't be the first.
- We got any other friends or family?

112
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,720
Friend Paula coming in.

113
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,420
- She was sitting the kid the night she disappeared.
- What about the daughter?

114
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,510
Marisa D'Amico.She's not returning our
phone calls.Rush is hunting her down.

115
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:48,140
Checked registrations on all '73
Eldorados No hits on the name "Lester.“

116
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,990
Check the dealership.See if there ever
was a guy that name worked on that lot.

117
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,160
I hate car salesman.

118
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,970
You could use a new ride.

119
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,450
What's wrong with my car?

120
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,700
Nothing,if you like being single.

121
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,610
Excuse me.Is that,um,Marisa?

122
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,810
Marisa?

123
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,680
Lily Rush.

124
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,020
I've called before about your mother.

125
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,630
My mother walked out when I was five.

126
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,520
We just found her body.

127
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:31,390
- Where?
- In the trunk of a car out in Elmwood.

128
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,120
Might explain what happened to her.

129
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,830
Can't say it's a real shock.

130
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,850
given her choice in men.

131
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,650
Anyone in particular?

132
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,950
I was referring to the loser who
knocked her up in high school.

133
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,400
Your dad.

134
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,180
Got to be around to earn
that title.Never en met him.

135
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,570
Who'd you grow up with?

136
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,650
Grandmother raised me...who
wasn't expecting to.

137
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,360
Reminded me constantly.

138
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,620
I know you were young,but if there's
anything you can remember about your mom:

139
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,980
what she was involved in...

140
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,920
Only thing I remember was we never
had any money or a place of our own.

141
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,480
The name "Lester" mean something to you?

142
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,910
No.

143
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,370
Did she leave anything
behind,personal effects?

144
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,930
Sorry,all I know is the police said
she cleaned out her bank account.

145
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,020
Couldn't get away fast enough.

146
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,170
You think of anything,let me know.

147
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,710
Always knew something
must have happened.

148
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,870
Donna never would have just taken off.

149
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,060
She loved that kid.

150
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,520
You were babysitting Marisa
the night she disappeared?

151
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,230
We were good friends in high school.

152
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,350
Dodged a baby bullet myself.

153
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,660
Figured I'd help her
out whenever I could.

154
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,740
Any guys she was
involved with at the time?

155
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,870
Dating was a hassle
for her,the kid and all.

156
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,780
She was really struggling
to make it on her own.

157
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,840
Any idea why she emptied her bank
account before she disappeared?

158
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,770
No,but it couldn't have been much.

159
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,250
Donna didn't have two nickels.

160
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,250
She owe anybody?Someone named Lester?

161
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,890
Wasn't like her.She hated to borrow.

162
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,070
Was a real blow when she had
to move back in with her mom.

163
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,410
I wouldn't wish that woman on anyone.

164
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,890
You worked with her at the dealership?

165
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,110
Helped her get the job as a greeter.

166
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,920
Quit 'cause I couldn't stand it anymore.

167
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,750
Bunch of sexist sharks.

168
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,010
No idea why she wanted
to swim in that tank.

169
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,600
(Devo's "Whip It" playing)

170
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,900
Steed Motors.

171
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,150
I'll transfer you to Service.Hold.

172
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,680
Hi,Mommy.

173
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,080
Aw,geez,Paula,I totally forgot.

174
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,240
Hi,boo!

175
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,260
I gotta run,Donna. I told
you I got a date tonight.

176
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,150
Yeah,I just gotta close out.

177
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,400
Just a few things.

178
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,230
Donna,hold all my calls,will ya,doll?

179
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,800
Clear my next appointment.

180
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,730
Tell Mickey the fleet sales can wait.

181
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,970
I want to make sure we get Mr.Callahan
here all squared away tonight.

182
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,220
Certainly,sir.

183
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,970
Now,George,if I can get him to throw in the floor
mats with the rustproofing,do we have a deal?

184
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,000
Come on,Frank.I stole
that guy's trade-in.

185
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,680
The deal should have
been two-pounder,easy.

186
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,050
Would you lower your voice,please?

187
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,240
You got a problem,take
it up with Mickey.

188
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,980
Please,sir,wait.Sir,please.

189
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,050
Someone has misplaced Mr.Hathaway's
keys to the Chevy Nova.

190
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,060
I'll get right on that,Sanil.

191
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,740
Perhaps Mr.Hathaway would like to take
one of our vehicles home tonight,huh?

192
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,070
Tell you what,sir.

193
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,380
Take the car home.

194
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,830
- Bring it back tomorrow,huh?
- Donna.

195
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,030
- Yeah.
- Stay late tonight?

196
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,400
Yeah,you know,about that Mickey,I've
been busting my hump around here.

197
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,570
- We all appreciate your hump,babe.
- yeah

198
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,170
Just give me a chance,all
right?Let me sell a car.

199
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,280
Who's gonna do your job,sweetheart,hmm?

200
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,900
You know that Lincoln Mark
trade that came in yesterday?

201
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,890
I know someone right
now I could flip it to.

202
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,260
All right,we'll see.

203
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,770
What about tonight?

204
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,190
Hey,you want your shot?

205
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,700
Pay your dues.Pay your dues.

206
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,950
I gotta stay late.

207
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,270
Can you drop Marisa
off at my mom's,please?

208
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,070
All right,all right.

209
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,910
Bye,baby.

210
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,650
Single mom,no degree,what
are you gonna do?

211
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,300
We found Donna's body in
the trunk of a '73 Eldorado.

212
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,000
You know anybody who
drove that kind of car?

213
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,420
No,but I wouldn't know
a K-car from a Carolla.

214
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,890
That was Donna's thing.

215
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,530
She could tell the car a guy
drove by the shoes he wore.

216
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,310
Lot of late nights at the dealer?

217
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,530
Maybe too many.

218
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,040
I know it was really
hard on little Marisa.

219
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,630
But her mom did the best that she could.

220
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,720
Boss,Auto Squad found a
VIN number on that Eldorado.

221
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,040
Tracked the DMV records on the owner.

222
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,620
Marshall Brooks.We got him?

223
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:48,810
He died a couple years ago but he traded in the Caddy
to Steed Motors the week before Donna disappeared.

224
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,710
What's was the name of that sales
manager who gave a statement back in '81?

225
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,430
It was Mickey Thompson,today
the proud owner of Steed Motors.

226
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,570
Thank you.

227
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,450
You boys let me know when the
Philly PD is ready to upgrade.

228
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,330
I'll get you into
something with real punch.

229
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,940
New Charger,0 to 60 in five seconds.

230
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,210
Volume deal,below invoice.

231
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,510
Brass gets the new cars.

232
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,030
We drive the beaters
till the wheels fall off.

233
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,000
Personally,I prefer the American classics like
the '73 Eldorado we found Donna D'Amico's body in.

234
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,600
That's a shame.

235
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,360
That gal was a real pistol.

236
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,040
- You gave a statement: said she left work at 7:00 that night.
- Sounds right.

237
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,280
Failed to mention it was in the trunk
of the Caddy headed for the salvage yard.

238
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,190
Title traced back to this lot
when you were sales manager,Mickey.

239
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,050
Lot of cars come through,guys.

240
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,290
The beaters come in one door and
out the next.Sold off for parts.

241
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,310
But before or after you
stripped the VIN number?

242
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,570
Hey,hold your horses.

243
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,300
Now,who's the owner
that traded that car in?

244
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,470
Marshall Brooks.

245
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,330
No,I don't remember the
car,but I remember him.

246
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,260
Repeat customer.One of Bruce's clients.

247
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,230
- Bruce?
- Bruce Donnelly.

248
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,610
Must have taken the Caddy off trade.

249
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,260
Lot of cash slipped away
on used cars back then.

250
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,780
Saying this guy dumped the Caddy?

251
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,590
Well,if it was a clunker,he could have had
it stripped for parts and sent to salvage.

252
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,620
And this Bruce had a problem with Donna?

253
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,730
Not when she was getting him coffee.

254
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,100
Donna was a go-getter.

255
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,010
Hey,you want to play with the
boys,you gotta roll with the punches.

256
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,470
(Blue Oyster Cult's
"Burnin' For You" playing)

257
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,020
Yo,Donna.

258
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,690
I just talked to the Tower.

259
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,270
He sees you've been
working your tail off.

260
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,000
I told him you could have the next up.

261
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,840
Come on.Mickey went for that?

262
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,970
Yo,Mickey.

263
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,910
Yeah,give it to the green pea.

264
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,210
Guy's looking for his daughter.

265
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,790
I sold him a car two years ago.

266
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,610
He's a whale.

267
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,420
I thought Sanil had next up.

268
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,780
Sanil couldn't close a door
with two hands and an arm.

269
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,460
Look,you work this right,this
could be worth a pound or maybe two.

270
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,500
I know everything about
that car,inside out.

271
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,690
Get him on the hook.

272
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,390
You tell him to follow yoinside.Don't
even turn around,all right?

273
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,310
Go on.Go make me proud.

274
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,610
Thanks,Bruce.

275
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,910
Show time.

276
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,640
Come inside?

277
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,370
So the guy wants to know if
we'll take a check,full amount.

278
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,550
Damn!I knew that guy was a laydown.

279
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,710
How about that?Didn't even
have to get him in the box.

280
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,510
That's gotta be some kind of a
record,writing the check on the hood of a car.

281
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,050
Don't I still have to get him inside?

282
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,520
Sign paperwork?

283
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,920
Yeah,why don't you get him to wallpaper the
showroom with his checks while you're at it?

284
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,820
I thought Bruce sold him a car.

285
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,360
Every schmuck on the lot
sold that flake a car.

286
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,260
Every month for the past five years.

287
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,650
What are you guys talking about?

288
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,760
The guys a major hoople.He just
likes talking to car salesmen.

289
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,180
Oh,you think that's funny,Bruce?

290
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,640
Oh,you can't handle it,why don't you go
back inside and answer the phone,sweetheart?

291
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,550
All right.

292
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:59,150
I think I'll call your wife first,tell her about all
the female customers you've been test-driving,huh?

293
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,920
- You wouldn't dare.
- Wouldn't I?

294
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,780
Salesman should never
mess where he eats.

295
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,100
Especially with the lady
who transfers his calls.

296
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,350
Bruce and Donna had a thing?

297
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,660
Thing or fling.Bruce was a dog.

298
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,380
He always had women calling the office.

299
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,050
Donna ever get to tell on his wife?

300
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,110
All I know is that he took two
weeks after she disappeared.

301
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,340
Bruce was a closer.He
never took a vacation.

302
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,660
You never told the cops?

303
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,950
He was still married.And
at the time,my top salesman.

304
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,670
Is he still selling cars?

305
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,260
Last I heard,up the street.

306
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,320
German luxury sedans,so screw him.

307
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,480
Excuse me.

308
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,140
Do you have an appointment?

309
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,770
Don't need one,Bruce.

310
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,190
Excuse me.

311
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,790
I thought you were customers.

312
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,210
- We can tell.
- Here about a car.

313
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,780
Remember this one?

314
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,100
'73 Eldorado?

315
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,570
Can't say I do.

316
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,660
You took it as a trade-in from Marshall
Brooks back when you worked at Steed Motors.

317
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,680
Long time ago.Maybe I did.

318
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,630
We found Donna D'Amico's
body stuffed in the trunk.

319
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,170
Greeter girl you had a thing
with before she disappeared?

320
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,080
I knew Donna.But we
definitely didn't have a thing.

321
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,080
Your old boss,Mickey,says different.

322
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,730
Then he's mistaken.

323
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,360
He's also a jealous schmuck.

324
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,290
Nothing more than a piker.

325
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,670
You can tell him I said that.

326
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,090
Told us you were the last
one to handle that Cadillac.

327
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,430
That's a crock.Look,I sold cars.

328
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,690
I didn't process trade-ins.

329
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,580
And I had no problem with Donna.

330
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,140
Way we heard it,she screwed
up your marriage pretty good.

331
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,370
I screwed up my marriage.

332
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,660
All four of 'em.Didn't
need any help with that.

333
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,140
Truth is,I tried to help Donna.

334
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,560
Nobody was moving American back then;
gas prices,the economy in the toilet.

335
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,930
But she saw something none of
the other jokers on the line did.

336
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,530
(The Pretenders' "Brass
in Pocket" playing)

337
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,910
Come on.The guy's a
tire-kicker.Look at him.

338
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,920
What?'Cause he's a Puerto Rican?

339
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,330
He won't even come inside.

340
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,870
He hates all the new models.

341
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,690
Deadbeat.Yeah,it's a waste of time.

342
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,230
Well,get rid of him before Mickey sees.

343
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,870
He's on the warpath today.

344
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,970
Just let the parts
manager go this morning.

345
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,170
Your kidding.Why?

346
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,480
Because the parts keep
disappearing,that's why.

347
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,210
Blaming him for the
break-in last month?

348
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,500
Hey,just get the chiseler
off the lot,all right?

349
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,330
Mickey called.

350
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,620
Actually,Donna,you're up.

351
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,220
For real.

352
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,820
Mickey said you can't
do any worse than Sanil.

353
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,800
This is no place for a lady.

354
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,890
You like that car,sir?

355
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,060
I don't know about these K-cars.

356
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,840
It's a lot of money
for all that plastic.

357
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,880
What's this leatherette thing?

358
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,870
I can't say that I blame you.

359
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,020
Let me show you something else.

360
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,910
cause I See,I,myself,

361
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,840
I prefer a car with a little more
meat on its bones,you know what I mean?

362
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,120
- This is a used car.
- And it's priced right.

363
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,160
I mean,forget those
little four-bangers.

364
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,260
What I like is a big V-8.

365
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,800
Some real power under the hood.

366
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,680
It's a big car.

367
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,820
You look like the kind
of man that can handle it.

368
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,010
I mean,look at these lines.

369
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,270
That is real leather inside.

370
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,990
Power everything.

371
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,060
Curves and chrome.

372
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,590
I mean,I think I lost my virginity in
the back of one of these babies,you know?

373
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,820
I'm Donna.

374
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:34,980
Esteban.

375
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,680
You want to talk price?

376
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,700
Follow me.

377
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,010
She sold that sled for
a pound over Blue Book.

378
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,640
Nobody was moving the
used stuff back then.

379
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,300
And she was smart.

380
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,490
Those American cars are classics now.

381
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,810
Nothing after 1980 is.

382
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,450
That break-in you mentioned.

383
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,760
- Anybody ever find out who did it?
- Nope.

384
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,100
- Cops interviewed everybody.
- Inside job?

385
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,040
That car lot,everybody was
working some kind of scam.

386
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,550
I dug up the old burglary report.

387
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,050
The break-in happened a month
prior to Donna's disappearance.

388
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,920
They killed the guard dogs?

389
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,870
Yeah.Threw poisoned meat over the fence.

390
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,030
Stole two-grand-worth
of parts.

391
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,770
- Insurance cover it?
- Yeah.

392
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,720
The lock on the gate wasn't even broken.

393
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,790
Trying to track down the
insurance investigator.

394
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,090
Inside job,Donna could have got
caught up in the mix somehow.

395
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,120
Well,whoever did it had to know
where to flip stolen auto parts.

396
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,400
The salesman,Oscar
Anderson,called in the burglary.

397
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,960
And was questioned extensively.

398
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,930
Well,history's about to repeat itself.

399
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,950
QD recovered the address on the
Lester receipt in Donna's jacket.

400
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,390
Receipt?

401
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,010
- A business address?
- 482 Ridge Avenue.

402
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,220
Today,it's a Wawa.But back
in '81,it was a Goodwill.

403
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,480
Marisa D'Amico came by,dropped that off.

404
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,890
Said you asked for it.

405
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,470
Personal effects from her mother.

406
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,600
I guess she thinks about
her more than she let on.

407
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:14,150
Now,all you would need to do to collect your
luxury spa vacation getaway prize,Mrs.Hanover,

408
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,900
Is attend a brief presentation upon
your arrival at our Las Vegas resort.

409
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,280
Thank you.

410
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,780
Bye-bye.

411
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,560
Once a salesman,always
a salesman,huh,Oscar?

412
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,750
Oh,I just do this to keep me young.

413
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,930
There's nothing quite like
the rush from a good sale.

414
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,140
You remember Donna D'Amico?

415
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,740
I remember the day the police
came,said she'd gone missing.

416
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,660
Yup.

417
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,410
Left that little girl behind.

418
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,070
- It's just awful.
- You see her the night before?

419
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,000
No,I had a big day on the board.

420
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,450
Took the boys out for drinks.

421
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,270
There was a burglary earlier
that month.You called it in?

422
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,650
I was first one on the lot.Had
to prep a car for a customer.

423
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,900
- You think Donna was involved?
- Do you?

424
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,140
Well,I know people were desperate.

425
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,470
You see,after the oil crisis,we
were selling an inferior product.

426
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,630
Hell,the government had
to bail out Chrysler.

427
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,360
What does that got to do with Donna?

428
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:15,420
A lot of guys were struggling just to feed their
families,and then Mickey lets this lady start selling cars.

429
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,960
Created some resentment.

430
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,930
The day she went on the board,the
timing could not have been worse.

431
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,600
Gotta squeeze more out of every deal.

432
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,380
Get 'em in the box.

433
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,920
Work the four square: Price,down
payment,monthly,trade-in.

434
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,720
And you hammer away.

435
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,100
Start high,you wear 'em down.

436
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,660
You confuse them!

437
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,220
When they're ready to give
up,you call in a closer.

438
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,830
It's not working,Mickey.

439
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,190
- They don't like the cars.
- What'd you say?

440
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,480
He means they can't trust us
when they don't trust the product.

441
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,440
I-I took a guy on a test drive.

442
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,760
I cranked up the
window,and the handle broke.

443
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,900
You want to sell?They
you do whatever it takes!

444
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,580
Cold canvass!

445
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,020
Work the phones!

446
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,780
No shown appointments,no more ups.

447
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,510
- I'm trying,Mickey.
- No.

448
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,900
No,what you're doing is that
you're failing,my friend,okay?!

449
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,660
I mean,the coffee girl could
sell cars better than you!

450
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,270
ah,because you let her take my last up!

451
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,410
- I didn't take anything.
- Shut your mouth,woman.

452
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,600
Haven't you done enough already?

453
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,310
I only closed that deal
'cause you couldn't.

454
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,250
You couldn't close a window,Hoover.

455
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,250
I've carried you long
enough.You know what?

456
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,830
Why don't you,why don't you
try selling vacuum cleaners?

457
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,500
(Queen's "Another One
Bites the Dust" playing)

458
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,590
Mickey,Mickey... please...

459
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,790
I need this job.

460
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,380
Now you need a new one.

461
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,750
Why are you still here?

462
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,810
Go on,hit the bricks.

463
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,860
I told her not to worry.

464
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,040
It wasn't her fault.

465
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,940
- But Sanil felt otherwise?
- I guess I never thought he'd hurt her.

466
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,140
So Donna got promoted,Sanil got canned.

467
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,980
It's either in the blood or it's not.

468
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,680
Some guys just can't close.

469
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,770
1979-- I came
here with nothing.

470
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,800
Tried to sell cars to make a living.

471
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,660
- Chrysler.
- Perfect timing.

472
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,330
Nobody wanted to buy American anymore.

473
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,510
Specially from me.

474
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,300
Donna D'Amico sold cars.

475
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,860
I understand you had a
big problem with that.

476
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,190
It wasn't personal.

477
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,350
We were all struggling.I
realize that now.

478
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,320
You were humiliated.

479
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,020
They fired you and you blamed her.

480
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,940
No,I went to night
school to learn computers.

481
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,380
Programming.1981...

482
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,750
Now,that was perfect timing.

483
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,820
You ever see Donna again
after they let you go?

484
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,730
Day when I came back
to get my last check.

485
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,320
I hated that place.

486
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,990
You didn't bleed the customer
dry,somebody else would do it for you.

487
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,020
DEsteban,what are you doing here?

488
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,650
I can't afford the car you sold me.

489
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,680
What do you mean?We went over
the numbers; it's a good deal.

490
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,560
But then they called me to come back in.

491
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,230
- Told me there was a problem
with my trade-in.- Problem?

492
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,500
The man said it was worth
less than what you told me.

493
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,100
That I owe more money.

494
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,380
Who called you?The finance department?

495
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,090
With this loan,I can afford to
make my payments and make rent.

496
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,660
Please,por favor,could you do something?

497
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,210
Yeah,just,uh...

498
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,690
just give me a minute,okay?

499
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,900
What is this,Frank?

500
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,860
Uh,floor mats,dealer prep
fee... 24% on his loan...

501
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,120
Hey,I did my job.

502
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,900
Mickey,come on,you got to
do something for this guy.

503
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,230
The bank's gonna repo his car that he needs to
get to his job and it's going to wreck his credit.

504
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,640
You,uh... you sign for this?

505
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,940
That your name right there?

506
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,700
You,uh,looking for a good buy,huh?

507
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:02,450
Well... "good-bye." You own it,buddy.

508
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,460
Welcome to America.

509
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,140
If they didn't get you on the front
end,F&I got you on the way out.

510
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,290
Donna told him she would never send
a customer in to him blind again.

511
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,150
Big profits on used cars.

512
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,350
So Donna started cutting
Frank out of the loop?

513
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,140
Sure,he figured it out.

514
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,730
I could think of a
lot of names for Frank.

515
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,050
But "stupid" isn't one of them.

516
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,540
Donna's compact,baby bracelet
from the hospital,phone bills.

517
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,530
It looks like the grandmother swept
it into a box after Donna disappeared.

518
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,720
Kind of sad.

519
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,730
All she has left of her mom.

520
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,720
Christmas card from the dealership.

521
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,150
Doesn't say who sent it,but
the address is handwritten.

522
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,600
Nothing else with the name Lester.

523
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,170
Are Donna's keys in there?

524
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:12,780
There's uh... grandmother's
apartment,car...

525
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,040
and then there's this one.

526
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,760
Kind of looks like it fits one
of those old steamer trunks.

527
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,110
Finally found your Lester.

528
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,230
Thanks for bringing that stuff in.

529
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,850
I'm sorry.It's all I had.

530
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,530
Your grandmother by any
chance own a piano,Marisa?

531
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,010
A piano?

532
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,980
No.Why?

533
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,010
This is a key to a piano.

534
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:03,590
The one your mother put a down payment
on the day before she was murdered.

535
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,420
I don't get it.

536
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,350
A Lester piano.

537
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,510
The ason your mom cleaned
out her bank account.

538
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,030
She bought a piano?

539
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,000
She said we didn't have any room for it.

540
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,130
She was looking for a new place.

541
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,580
I remember her telling me that.

542
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,810
I just wanted it to be true.

543
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:39,670
(playing "Chopsticks")

544
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,850
Let's do it again.

545
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,350
We can't,boo.

546
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,410
I have to be at work.

547
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,620
I want a piano-- a real
one-- to play at home.

548
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,290
Well,maybe someday,when
we find a place for it.

549
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,900
Grandma doesn't have enough space.

550
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,920
And that is another reason why
Mommy has to go to work now.

551
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,970
I don't like it when you got to work.

552
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,360
I don't either,you know,but
everybody's got a job they got to do.

553
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,040
Do you like your job,Mommy?

554
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,800
I like that I found
something that I'm good at.

555
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:14,820
You know,it's real important in life that
you find something that you're good at.

556
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,170
She always had to go away.

557
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,190
I used to think she went to work...

558
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,430
to get away from me.

559
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:36,400
I know what it's like to have a
parent walk out on you as a kid,Marisa.

560
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,200
But that's not what your mother did.

561
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,580
Now,I'm going to find out
whoever took her away from you.

562
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,140
I was in mortgages until
the sub prime thing blew up.

563
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,170
Never thought I'd find another business that
would tank as bad as American cars,but I did.

564
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Cars,caskets-- still dinging
them on the way out,huh,Frank?

565
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,720
Your line of work-- Should the
bereaved ever need a referral.

566
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,290
You were the numbers guy at
Steed Motors back in the '80s?

567
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,230
The numbers stunk.That's why I got out.

568
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,630
See,and we thought it was
'cause of that burglary in '81.

569
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,910
You saying I robbed the place?

570
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,370
Well,probably made the boss money
on that insurance claim-- win-win.

571
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,840
Donna figure it out,too?

572
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,520
All those calls of
yours she transferred?

573
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,190
That what this is
about-- Donna D'Amico?

574
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:25,080
She cut you out.Kept you from
screwing the customers on the back end.

575
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,460
She didn't get it.

576
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,100
Customers have all the power.

577
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,560
They can leave any time.

578
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,330
- Our job was no different than yours.
- Come again?

579
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:36,960
Get 'em in the box,get as much as you can,get
'em to sign before they walk out the door.

580
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,900
I look like a salesman to you,Frank?

581
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,020
You do what you have to do.

582
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:45,080
Befriend,persuade,control,lie.

583
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,680
But once they sign,they're
going to pay for it for years.

584
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,290
Donna got it,Frank.

585
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,690
She just did it her way.

586
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,770
It just turned out to
be bad for your business.

587
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,470
Donna figured out how the
real money was made on the lot.

588
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:01,610
And that put her in direct conflict with
someone a lot more dangerous than me.

589
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,780
Who the hell do you think you are?

590
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,020
Telling customers not to
buy add-ons or financing.

591
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,800
Why,so you can rape my
customers on the back end,Frank?

592
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,260
FRANK: You don't know when to quit.

593
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,010
Hey,she's right,Frank.

594
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,500
All you young sharks are
destroying our business.

595
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,280
You rip a customer's head off
on a deal,they never come back.

596
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,650
Stay out of this,Oscar.

597
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,790
Kills all our referrals,all
our repeat business.

598
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,310
You don't sell a man one car.

599
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,730
You sell him a dozen
cars over a lifetime.

600
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,070
That's a profession,damn it.

601
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,470
Go blow a sale,you old bag of wind.

602
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,330
Why would I help you,Frank?

603
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,490
You're selling cars out from under me.

604
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,540
What are you talking about?

605
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:44,700
I had a guy on the hook the other day,selling a '72
Chevelle-- only to find out it had already been sold.

606
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,420
That wasn't my call.That car
was promised to the wholesaler.

607
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,740
For a song.I know the
Blue Book on that car.

608
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,400
I could have sold it for twice that.

609
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,830
Talk to the Tower.

610
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,350
Who,Mickey?

611
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,970
Why would we dump a good
car for that much less?

612
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:02,290
If you know what's good for you,lady,you talk
to your boss before selling another used car.

613
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:10,430
Donna figured out the sales manager was giving
the best trade-ins to the wholesaler for peanuts.

614
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,280
Mickey?Why would he do that?

615
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,120
Kickbacks.He was lining his pockets.

616
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,820
Screwing over the dealership
owner,and Donna knew it.

617
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,420
But you signed her timecard.

618
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,550
Said Donna left at 7:00 that night.

619
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,950
Mickey had me do that for everybody.

620
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,920
I closed a deal that night.

621
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,210
She was there at least till 10:00.

622
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,900
He had you take care of
that old Cadillac too,Frank?

623
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,290
Me?No.

624
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,190
Mickey decided what
happened to every trade-in.

625
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:36,760
Whether it went to the
lot,wholesaler... or the salvage yard.

626
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,170
- Got me in the box,Detective?
- Yep.

627
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,140
Well,I've done this to
thousands of customers.

628
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,160
Unlike those schmucks,I
know I can walk anytime.

629
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,880
Yeah,you made quite a
ving ripping people off.

630
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,560
People always think
they're getting ripped off.

631
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,800
Look,you're trying to get the best
deal-- I'm trying to make a living.

632
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,270
I just don't like to lose.

633
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,020
Talking about you ripping off
your boss-- the dealership owner.

634
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,040
- Stole so much you became one yourself.
- Bunch of twaddle.

635
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,580
The smart owner knows every guy on
the lot is working some kind of scam.

636
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,970
Too bad Donna figured out
your big used car scam.

637
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,140
She didn't leave at 7:00 like you said.

638
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,190
She stuck around to confront you.

639
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:24,340
- You got nothing.- One of your old lackeys
clued us in as to how you worked the break-in,

640
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,420
the inside job,insurance fraud.

641
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,340
Sounds like I need better lackeys.

642
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,170
Willing to testify that you sent
that '73 Caddy to the salvage yard.

643
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,110
With Donna's body in the trunk.

644
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,340
The only thing we care about
here is the homicide,Mick.

645
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,840
Who told you this nonsense?

646
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,180
Frank?

647
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,390
Let's see... the price
for homicide is life.

648
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,510
Plus fees,which...

649
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,160
you'll be paying on the inside.

650
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,910
Now your down payment so far,is zero.

651
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,760
What do you want your
monthly payment to be?

652
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,650
Unless of course,you're
offering a trade-in?

653
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,080
Do you have anything to trade,Mick?

654
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,010
Except a bunch of bull?

655
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:09,250
See... I'm willing to go to bat for you
here,but you gotta give something up.

656
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,390
You got to...

657
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,830
you got to meet me in
the middle.My boss...

658
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,030
he's gonna hammer me on this one.

659
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,830
So this is your best offer.

660
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,960
I don't think it's
gonna get this deal done.

661
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,190
I liked Donna.

662
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,590
Gotta hand it to her.She
was a hell of a salesman...

663
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,210
In some ways,too good.

664
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,070
- At selling cars?
- Used cars.

665
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,960
She had an eye for it,she knew
what a car was really worth.

666
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,810
Like the ones you sent back to
the wholesalers for kickbacks?

667
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,880
Couldn't let her kill the golden goose.

668
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,030
So I offered her a deal...

669
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,220
I know what you're doing,Mickey.

670
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,550
You know just enough to
get yourself in trouble.

671
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,690
Close the door.

672
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,490
Me?You're the one
stealing this place blind.

673
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,570
You're screwing over the owner.

674
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,580
The owner thinks I'm a hero
'cause I make him a lot of money.

675
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,130
You?

676
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,110
Well,he doesn't even
know your name,sweetheart.

677
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:30,260
All I wanted was a
chance to sell,you know.

678
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,240
A chance to prove myself.

679
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,080
Yeah,yeah,and you got that.

680
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,430
Thanks to me.

681
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,240
Congratulations.

682
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,210
You got your bonus.

683
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,050
Fair and square.

684
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,560
Tops on the board,profit-wise.

685
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,370
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

686
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,290
You know,Oscar was right.

687
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,430
We keep doing business like this,and
there ain't gonna be any business left.

688
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,550
Oscar?Why you listening to Oscar for?

689
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,930
- He hasn't sold a car in months.
- What do you mean?

690
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,740
I thought you took him off the
board to handle fleet sales.

691
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,840
Oscar couldn't handle a yard sale.

692
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,710
Would of fired him a long time
ago,but I felt bad for the old guy.

693
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,130
Let him wash cars to
earn his keep around here.

694
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,870
I earned this.

695
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,870
- For me and for 'Riss.
- Sure,kid.

696
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,230
Yeah.

697
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,370
But in the future?

698
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,340
You check with me before
you sell a trade-in...

699
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,270
Never came back.

700
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,730
Thought she took the money and ran.

701
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,630
Tell me about this Oscar,the has-been.

702
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,310
Tough racket,selling
cars.Game just passed him by.

703
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,170
Was he there the night
that Donna disappeared?

704
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,440
Every night.

705
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,440
He had a lot of cars to wash.

706
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,540
Even let the old guy lock up.

707
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,280
The pulled DMV records
on an Oscar Anderson.

708
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,080
Found his name registered
to a 1971 Cadillac Eldorado.

709
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,150
'71?

710
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,870
Donna's body was found in the trunk
of a '73,Right,a salvage yard beater.

711
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,900
But the models share a lot of the
same parts,and those require upkeep.

712
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,230
You know,seats,wheels,bumpers,you
name it.

713
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,190
It's possible Oscar was taking
parts off the beater for a '71 Caddy.

714
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,730
Yeah.Didn't know he was going to
need it that night to hide a body.

715
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:11,010
Power locks,power steering,power roof.

716
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,710
It's a car ahead of its time.

717
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,360
Won it back in '71.

718
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,930
Top man on the board.

719
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,390
Nine out of 12 months.

720
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,400
- A real classic.
- Oh,yeah.

721
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,900
Bet you Donna could
appreciate a car like this.

722
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,030
She turned out to be a
pretty shrewd salesgal.

723
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,360
Got to admit that.

724
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,100
Kind of a shame how it
ended for you there,Oscar.

725
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,910
At the dealership.

726
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,020
Oh,I had my cold spells.

727
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,340
But I'll tell you this-- when I was
on a roll,there was nobody hotter.

728
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:40,800
Mickey told us you hadn't
sold a car in months.

729
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,300
- You lied to us,Oscar.
- Said you were out celebrating some sale.

730
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,410
Boozing with the boys the
night Donna disappeared.

731
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,420
Well,that's ridiculous.

732
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,400
I don't remember if it
was that exact night.

733
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,880
You should,'cause you
were there on the lot.

734
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,690
Out back washing cars.

735
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,750
You were the next Hoover.

736
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,710
One step away from
hawking vacuum cleaners.

737
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,720
- Magazines,telemarketing...
- Now wait just a damn minute.

738
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,960
I had a run of bad luck is all.

739
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,800
But my customers always came back.

740
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,620
You were done,Oscar.Doing
chores for Mickey.

741
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,900
Locking up,taking the
beaters to salvage.

742
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,630
Like that '73 Caddy.

743
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,150
And when you stripped the VIN
number off,probably some parts,too.

744
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:20,980
'71 never had an egg-crate style grill.

745
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,550
It's 'cause it's from a '73.

746
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,840
Oh,come on.

747
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,390
We take this car apart we going
to find more parts from that '73?

748
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,620
- You can't do that.
- You got careless,Oscar.

749
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,480
You dumped the body,but
you took the parts.

750
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,710
Stole her money,and left
her to rot in that junkyard.

751
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,070
But,hey,you sent Donna's
family a Christmas card.

752
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,710
Marisa saved it.It's got
your handwriting on it.

753
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,580
But you really think that would
make up for killing her mother?

754
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,990
I didn't kill that woman.

755
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,670
And I did not steal her bonus.

756
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,360
What bonus,Oscar?

757
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,720
How'd you know she got a bonus,Oscar?

758
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,920
- You just told me.
- No,we said you took her money.

759
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,150
Now how'd you know about
the bonus she got that night?

760
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,780
Now hold on a minute.Just wait a second.

761
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,470
I'm trying to explain.

762
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:00,810
I... I want to...I'm trying to..

763
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,170
It wasn't me that changed.

764
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,180
You know,it...

765
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,370
...it was the business.

766
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:19,310
You give me a quality car,bet
your ass,I could still close 'em.

767
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,400
Sure you could.

768
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,090
We can work something out here,right?

769
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,440
We... we can work something out?

770
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,090
Yeah,we can work something out.

771
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,990
Just a spell of bad
luck,that's all it was.

772
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,630
If I could have just broken through...

773
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,970
I'd have been right back
on top of that board.

774
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,120
Hey,Oscar.

775
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,810
Oh,hey,Donna.

776
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,690
Just prepping a car for
an appointment tomorrow.

777
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,280
It's good to see you
still get repeat business.

778
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,090
Well,it's the only way.

779
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:13,990
You build a reputation,it's
about repeats and referrals.

780
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,430
Matter of time,I'm back on a
roll bucking for that bonus.

781
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,410
Hey,who won it this time,by the way?

782
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,250
I sold another car today,Oscar.

783
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,530
I got the bonus.

784
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,560
- What?Really?
- Yeah.

785
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,900
I... That's great,kid!

786
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,700
Congratulations!

787
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,480
Yeah.

788
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,560
So how'd you close that baby?

789
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,940
You know,I just knew
what the guy wanted.

790
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,100
And I let the sale come to me.

791
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,820
Like you say.

792
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,840
Get a real charge out of it,too.

793
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,430
Oh,don't I know it.

794
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,430
That feeling never gets old.

795
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,800
You see this car here--
came on the lot today?

796
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,990
- Yeah,the Impala.
- Yeah.

797
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:04,180
Back in '72,I must have sold 20 of
these babies the minute they hit the lot.

798
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,130
Still a good car.

799
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,400
People just don't,uh...
hold on to them anymore.

800
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,310
Harold Bloom.Look at that.

801
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,230
Yeah,that's his trade-in.

802
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,460
That's the guy I sold the car to today.

803
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,400
I know Harold.

804
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,560
I sold him this car.

805
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,100
You sold him this car?

806
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,210
- This Impala?
- Harold's my client!

807
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,980
You know what I had to
do to make this sale?

808
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,200
Look,he just came in.He
didn't ask for you.

809
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,260
- Why the hell not?!
- I don't know.

810
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,740
Look,I feel terrible.

811
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,300
I am so sorry.

812
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,580
I'll split the commission with you.

813
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,360
I don't want your charity!

814
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,710
You know,it's just not right.

815
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,580
It's not how you do business..

816
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,020
.I feel horrible.

817
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,570
You don't have to do this.

818
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,720
Do what?

819
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,950
You don't have to wash cars for Mickey,you
know,you could do something else.

820
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,620
How dare you?

821
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,650
You know,I'm not some
vacuum cleaner salesman.

822
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,630
Who do you think you're talking to?!

823
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,030
I was selling cars when
you were in diapers.

824
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:06,200
I have been a closer
since before you were born!
