you played high school ball with al?

00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,800

halfback in philly in 1967.

murdered the night before
the '73 championship.

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,820
no one knew until he was
a no-show for the game.

55
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,490
check this out.

56
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,360
i'm always searching ebay

57
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,400
for warrior stuff.

58
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,870
found this

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,710
tucked inside a program.

60
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,840
"ticket sign-out sheet."

61
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,330
the way players got tickets
to family and friends.

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,770
now,i know you only played defense,

63
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,170
but,uh,try and keep up.

64
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,160
look at the signature.

65
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,820
mcshane signed out tickets

66
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,050
to r. boreki at 9:00 a.m.

67
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,790
day of the game.

68
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,940
but the cops said he was murdered
10:00 p.m.the night before.

69
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,310
they thought he ran into
some drunk state fans.

70
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,130
big rivalry game.emotions running high.

71
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,020
right.except according to this...

72
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,280
mike was alive on saturday.

73
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,590
that's an entire
morning unaccounted for.

74
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,180
his mom...

75
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,280
she still comes in.

76
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,490
once a year... look
at the pictures of him.

77
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,210
sure would mean a lot to her...

78
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,750
hell,all of us.

79
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,430

leaky pipes.

85

nothing but the best
upkeep for the cold ones.

86
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,100
yeah,this will look great in court.

87
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,730
michael "bad moon" mcshane.

88
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,300
came to the u. in '70 on a full ride.

89
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,490
recruited from latrobe high school.

90
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,310
small-town kid.

91
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,100
only child.raised by
his english teacher mom.

92
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,980
sends her boy off to
school,and he never comes home.

93
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,780
body's found near a dumpster

94
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,200
between the players' dorm and the
stadium parking lot near section g-68.

95
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,790
group of students leaving
the game found him.

96
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,710
blunt-force trauma to the head.

97
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,960
weapon never found.

98
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,310
coroner... innskeep stated time of
death was 10:00 p.m. friday night.

99
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,330
same numbskull coroner who mucked
up every job he touched in the '70s.

100
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,420
there was a message taped
to mike's door friday night

101
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,530
"pez called."

102
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,170
pez? drug dealer nickname?

103
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,940
or the nickname for "r. boreki,"

104
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,990
the guy he signed out the tickets to.

105
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,050
mike's trading player tickets
for drugs.deal goes down wrong.

106
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,470
questioned documents looked
at the sign-out sheet.

107
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,380
it's mike's signature.

108
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,190
it's proof he was there that morning.

109
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,100
so the call from pez

110
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,310
was a set-up to meet?

111
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,430
well,section g-68 was isolated.

112
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,870
original report said a lot
of drug deals went down there.

113
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,950
fullback's a big guy.yet no one saw
him friday nig or saturday morning?

114
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,780
not his best bud tom "the breeze"
bernard,no one on the team,campus...

115
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,430
new timeline might jog some memories.

116
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,590
go visit the u.? see what the team
was doing morning moon's killed?

117
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,500
grab some yearbooks,see if
you can find this "r. boreki."

118
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,080
what do you say,tombstone?

119
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:59,190
i have so many photos of mike playing
football,but this is my favorite.

120
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,100
mike liked to read.

121
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,610
when he was younger,oh,yes.

122
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,490
before the sports took over.

123
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,290
sounds like there was a lot
more to mike than just football.

124
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,280
mrs. mcshane,we're looking
for a friend of his.

125
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,440
r. boreki?

126
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,150
mike ever mention him?

127
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,630
i'm sorry.

128
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,560
you know,mike had so many friends.

129
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,820
that's why i could never understand

130
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,960
why anybody would want to hurt him.

131
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,810
excuse me.

132
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,470
talked to the stadium ticket clerk.

133
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,900
guy never saw mcshane.

134
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,460
what about "r. boreki"?

135
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,360
nope. but i did get us a tailgater.

136
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,880
guys are camped out in the
parking lot before the sun's up?

137
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,740
got to have a game day permit.

138
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,000
rusty jenkins. section g-68.

139
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,830
guy saw a car hightailing it
out of there 'round 9:30 a.m.

140
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,610
there's no crying
allowed in slinging rock.

141
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,090
- good to see you.
- yeah. i mean...

142
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,330

143
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,120

146
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,330

147
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,980
which way to the mud bath?

148
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,580
warrior football
brings in 45 mil a year.

149
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,830
i'm sure they got one.

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,230
got to love amateur sports.

151
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,710
gentlemen.

152
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,380

00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,050
valens.

155
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,420
not a bad-looking
team you got this year.

156
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,110
season's still young.

157
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,440
you were an assistant
when mike mcshane played?

158
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,620
yes,sir. i'll tell you what.

159
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,300
mike was what warrior
football was all about.

160
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,600
together we stand?

161
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,050
you better believe it.

162
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,070
his death was a hell of a shock.

163
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,080
took the program years to recover.

164
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,990
you know anyone named r. boreki?

165
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,850
maybe went by "pez"?

166
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,840

167
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,530

mi casa es su casa.

178
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,080
say,uh... mike was still
alive saturday morning?

179
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,660
good
friends,teammates--

180
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,720
figured you'd know if he was
mixed up in some kind of trouble.

181
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,150
no way. no way.

182
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,690
mike would never do anything
to embarrass the program.

183
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,770
24 hours leading up to the game,

184
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,400
players must have had their rituals.

185
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,580
sure. you know,some of the guys
hit the bars,blow off steam.

186
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,960
mike with you that night?

187
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,770
no. but i didn't think anything of it.

188
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,240
why's that?

189
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,390
he'd read in his room.

190
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,630
he'd try to hide it.

191
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,960
but you didn't play in
that same game either.

192
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,290
something keep you from the field?

193
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,540
yeah,i blew my knee out the week before.

194
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,330
never played again.

195
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,010
couple names coming up: pez.r. boreki.

196
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,350
ever hear of 'em?

197
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,800
that don't sound familiar.

198
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,130
you think of anyone else
might have had it in for mike?

199
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,850
man,mike was a stand-up guy.

200
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,890
everybody loved him.

201
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,520
(the doobie brothers
"china grove" playing)

202
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,030
thanks,stace.

203
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,620
warrior win and cold beer. life is good.

204
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,160
which way to the watergate hotel?

205
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,940
take that stupid thing off.

206
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,110
when the sun comes up
selling these everywhere.

207
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,330
man,that guy's going down.
("on the sleepy little town...")

208
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,310
if the president of the united
states says he didn't do it,he didn't.

209
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,290
how would you know? he wouldn't
lie to the whole country,man.

210
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,790
everybody's saying he's guilty.

211
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,280
well,i believe him.

212
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,930
people got to stay loyal.

213
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,810
like "together we stand."

214
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,560
you're the last boy scout,moon.

215
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,870
hey,how about a doob?

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,530
i got to split.

217
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,070
see you at weights tomorrow?

218
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,790
yeah,you'll see me.i'll be the guy...

219
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,870
out-benching you.

220
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,370
in your dreams.

221
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,480
groove on,baby.

222
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,390
groove on.

223
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,050
got to love the '70s.

224
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,880
instant replay and the pill.

225
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,060
two greatest inventions ever.

226
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,930
so,who hosted this
party,someone's parents?

227
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,520
steve pratt.

228
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,920
booster with big bucks.

229
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,740
they just opened up his housesure.

230
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,530
sure. he recruited moon.

231
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,570
was real close with him.

232
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,360
same pratt who paid for
half the new stadium?

233
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,360
still comes to every game.

234
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,780
well,thanks,breeze.we'll
let you get back to it.

235
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,420
all right.see you.

236
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,330
i remember
two-a-day practices.

237
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,320
never been in such pain.

238
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,330
man,if i could go back.

239
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,850
you ever play?

240
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,080
little bit.

241
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,320
heard mike mcshane spent a
lot of time here,mr. pratt.

242
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,670
oh,hosted a few warrior
parties back in the day.

243
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,320
they get kind of wild?

244
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,220
it was a different time.

245
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,420
mike ever come to you with any problems?

246
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,770
drugs or money?

247
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:53,070
mike was just a fun-loving kid who believed
in god,country and warrior football.

248
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,430
you two close?

249
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,430
both small-town kids
who played big-time ball.

250
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,290
you knew that mike
grew up without a dad.

251
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,140
well,come rain or shine,i took him
out for a good dinner once a week.

252
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,040
that boy needed a father figure.

253
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,530
mr. pratt,you never answered
my question about drug use.

254
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,530
mike worked two jobs,and he
still couldn't make ends meet.

255
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,750
("rock on" by david essex playing)

256
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,230
thanks,honey.

257
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,650
to you,mike.

258
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,620
hell of a season so far.

259
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,800
thanks,mr. pratt.

260
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,850
damn it,son. it's been
three years.call me steve.

261
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,890
sorry. steve.

262
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,800
- i have never profited,never profited...
- can you believe this,

263
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,870
the way they're treating the president?

264
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,350
hey,joe.

265
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,100
could you turn that thing off?

266
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,000
you seem a littl preoccupied.

267
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,950
- well,mr. pratt, i hate to ask...
- are you low on cash?

268
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,320
- just till the end of the week.
- say no more.

269
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,640
hope it's for a girl.

270
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,450
textbooks.

271
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,760
good one.

272
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,530
now,you remember,

273
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,770
you can always come to me.

274
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,360
okay? warrior football is
about sticking together.

275
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,650
and that ain't bull.

276
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,570
no,sir.

277
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,030
you think the money was for drugs?

278
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,720
back then i would've said no.

279
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,490
not a kid like mike.

280
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,400
but now i've seen it
happen to too many players.

281
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,280
someone named pez out
with you that night?

282
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,420
i don't think i ever heard that name.

283
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,550
careful of the pool.

284
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,380
i've done everything i can to
brainwash that boy into loving football.

285
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,050
but he likes soccer.

286
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,160
the things you live to see,detective.

287
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,810
well,i haven't been here
since the '04 playoffs.

288
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,390
mcnabb lit it up.

289
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,970
then the super bowl happened.

290
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,470
yeah,how much you lose on that game?

291
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,360
that's not the point.

292
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,570
- rusty jenkins?
- yeah?

293
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,200
you the detectives
here about,uh,bad moon?

294
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,060
you were parked at warrior
stadium that morning?

295
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,700
firing up the old barrel.

296
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,510
you know,you got to get that pork
falling right off the bone by game time.

297
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,720
you ain't lived till you've had my pork.

298
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,820
sounds delicious.
now,about that morning?

299
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,170
you said you saw a car.

300
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,680
yeah,a red one.

301
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,240
he busted out of there
like he robbed a bank.

302
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,840
you get a good look at the driver?

303
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,230
- nah,he was too far away.-
was the car a two-door?

304
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,720
yeah,it was like one
of them muscle cars.

305
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,950
like a stock car with a
white stripe on the side?

306
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,940
yeah,i think there was.

307
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,590
that's a plymouth
duster. it's got to be.

308
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,180
well,thanks,rusty.

309
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,010
you should do repo work.

310
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,570
busted out of there like a bank robber.

311
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,810
or a killer fleeing a crime scene.

312
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,700
missed out on rusty's pork.

313
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
what are all these files?

314
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,510
records from the dmv.

315
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,190
november '73.

316
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,190
we're looking for anything suspicious

317
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,420
in a red plymouth duster.

318
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,000
you're evil.

319
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,620
oh. found your name in the
yearbook,professor boreki.

320
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,040
mike mcshane a good friend of yours?

321
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,490
- i was his tutor.
- so,why did he leave tickets for you?

322
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,110
well,one of the supposed
perks of the job.

323
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,070
- guess i was next in line.
- big fan,huh?

324
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,990
no.

325
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,880
almost un-american,isn't it?

326
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,890
- so why tutor those guys?
- i needed the money.

327
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,730
students who couldn't throw an inflated
ball actually had to pay their own way.

328
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,620
whitney fellowship? what's that?

329
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,980
it's an academic scholarship.
gonna pay for my grad school.

330
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
free ride,just like me.

331
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,450
what are you gonna study?

332
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,750
you got a beowulf
paper due in two weeks.

333
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,760
i can write that for you next weekend.

334
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,530
shouldn't you help me with it?

335
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,890
{\a6}("do it again" by steely dan playing)

336
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,090
you read beowulf?

337
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,750
just started it.

338
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,240
yeah. you should stick to your
playbook.i'll handle the paper,t-bone.

339
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,110
it's bad moon.

340
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,290
you know,you guys sound
like a ponderosa menu?

341
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,310
t-bone,chunk,ribeye.

342
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,800
you never had a nickname.
that's your problem.

343
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,220
don't worry. i'll think of one for you.

344
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:29,420
- hey mike
- how you doing,cynthia?

345
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,170
these players needed guys like me.

346
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,470
they'd lose their eligibility
if their gpa fell below a 2.0.

347
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,050
hey,what about the pills he was taking?

348
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,680
i tutored a lot of players.

349
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,690
they were always jacked up on something.

350
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,330
- painkillers or uppers.
- where'd they get the drugs?

351
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,100
they had some quack
supplying the whole team.

352
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,900
now,this,uh,quack
doctor,ever hear his name?

353
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,200
no,i'm sorry,i really...
wouldn't know about that.

354
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,680
name pez ring any bells?

355
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,190
no. you'd have to ask
someone on the team.

356
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,530
right.

357
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,570
you were just a... tutor.

358
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,290
uh,if you think of anything else,

359
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,960
professor,let me know.

360
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,960
i don't understand.

361
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,600
mike was never sick a day in his life.

362
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,760
- your son never mentioned taking any pills?
- pills for what?

363
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,390
maybe to help recover from
a game? injury or pain?

364
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,800
the-the team was on a vitamin program.

365
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,820
- a vitamin program.
- mike never liked it.

366
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,730
he always hated needles from
the time he was a little boy.

367
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,850
these vitamin shots,do you
know who gave them to your son?

368
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,000
no. he just told me the
whole team took them.

369
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,380
you wouldn't believe all the
trainers and doctors they have now.

370
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,630
i used to have to tape my own ankles.

371
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,740
what was the doctor's name
you saw back in the day?

372
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,940
you mean the team doctor?

373
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,720
no,the other one,uh,

374
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,640
the guy off campus,the local guy.

375
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,360
- had a crazy nickname.
- pez?

376
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,290
what about him?

377
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,160
hooked you up with
painkillers,cortisone,right?

378
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,380
whatever it took to get
the body back on the field.

379
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,470
what about vitamin shots?

380
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,220
vitamin shots?

381
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,290
what are you talking about?

382
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,280
do you remember the doc's real name?

383
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,770
what's he got to do...

384
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,420
with bad moon's murder?

385
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,770
i don't know. we'll see.

386
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,460
long time ago,will.

387
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,700
come on,al,you kicked up the dust
on this case,brought it to me.

388
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,500
where you going with this?

389
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,180
thinking steroids.

390
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,690
back then? i never saw it.

391
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,030
no. the warriors ran a clean program.

392
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,550
then why go under the table for shots?

393
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,810
except to break ncaa
rules,not to mention the law.

394
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,340
i don't believe it.

395
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,640
then tell me the doctor's name.

396
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,840
if you're right,

397
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,110
and this gets out,

398
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,350
the whole program,

399
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,030
even now,people will get hurt.

400
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,810
screw the warriors program,al.
the kid got murdered.

401
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,680
we got to see this through.

402
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,560
just give me a name.

403
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,960
dr. lason,nice digs you got here.

404
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,640
i understand you did some work
with the warriors back in the day.

405
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,890
former players are starting to talk.

406
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,770
your name keeps coming up...

407
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,550
pez.

408
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,540
i run a sports medicine clinic.

409
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,210
i make my money on player referrals.

410
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,210
did you drive a red
duster back in the '70s?

411
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,070
no,and i don't think i like
the tone of this conversation.

412
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,680
you called mike the night
before he was killed.

413
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,200
- wanted to meet.
- that just a bad coincidence,doc?

414
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,900
- my attorney's number.
- you were involved in a drug ring where a kid ended up dead.

415
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,540
thanks for your time,dr. lason.if we have
any more questions,we'll give you a call.

416
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,740
what's up?

417
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,970
check out dr. lason's golf buddy.

418
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,900
son of a bitch.

419
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,730
popular guy,this pratt.

420
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,170
big game tomorrow.

421
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,510
oh,playing michigan for the 75th time.

422
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,670
you got to love college tradition.

423
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,540
tradition like doping the players?

424
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,970
i don't understand.

425
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,880
dr. lason,steroids,your money.

426
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,500
understand?

427
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,230
mike was just like the rest of the boys.

428
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,610
he would do anything to play ball!

429
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,960
including taking steroids?

430
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,580
nobody knew the side effects.

431
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,850
hell,nobody even knew
what they were back then.

432
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,620
not that you bothered to find out.

433
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,560
we thought we were helping him.

434
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,470
it had nothing to do with mike's death.

435
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,870
so why was he calling dr. lason?

436
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,320
it was about breeze.

437
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,510
you okay,man?

438
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,990
i'm okay. i'm okay.

439
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,120
are you sure?

440
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,080
just don't say anything to coach.

441
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,020
come on,breeze. something's wrong here.

442
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:37,400
i'm begging you,mike.don't
tell them. please?

443
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,920
don't. mike,don't!

444
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,630
mr. pratt!

445
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,520
what'd you do?

446
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,360
my advice was for him to tell the coach.

447
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,830
turns out

448
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,790
that breeze had a bad kidney

449
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,960
which he didn't want
the team to know about.

450
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,340
a life-threatening condition.

451
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,880
- when was this?
- a couple of days before mike died.

452
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,400
mike must have called dr.
lason to take a look at breeze.

453
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,680
that when the coach let breeze go?

454
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,550
yes.

455
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,730
and breeze blamed mike for it.

456
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,990
i sure hope not.

457
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,710
it's not looking good
for the breeze-man.

458
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,310
being kicked off the
team,lying about pez.

459
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,760
a little 'roid rage. bad stuff happens.

460
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,510
i'm pulling him in tomorrow morning.

461
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,860
thinks he's gonna look at mug shots.

462
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,340
it's kinda sad.these
guys still so stuck in it.

463
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,850
the glory days.

464
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,070
i keep waiting for mine to start.

465
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,930
i'm outta here.

466
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,750
audi? what,are you 16?

467
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,200
sorry,granny,i must depart.

468
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,620
i'll see you guys tomorrow.

469
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,020
yep.all right.

470
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,030
two of whatever this guy's having.

471
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,290
oh,detective rush.

472
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,120
i'd say you we're lookin' smokin' hot,

473
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,490
but it'd be an inappropriation
to my co-worker.

474
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,220
i wouldn't want that.

475
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,230
inappropriation a word?

476
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,990
should be.

477
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,050
i came over 'cause i got a question.

478
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,210
question away.

479
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,890
you were talking to that
addict on the last job.

480
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,910
how it is when you started using.

481
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,060
you're free. you're flying.

482
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,020
sounds like you've been there.

483
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,360
so you're thinking,"what's
a guy in na doing in a bar?"

484
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,250
that or you're a better liar than i am.

485
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,630
liar?

486
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,600
i consider us storytellers.

487
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,690
you know,like i came over
'cause i got a question.

488
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,520

500
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,430

501
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,930
thanks for coming in.

502
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,450

00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,510
- this is detective rush.
- nice to meet you.

509
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,320
said you might have a suspect.

510
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,110
yeah. you.

511
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,730
let's count the lies: pez,steroid use,

512
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,700
how they booted you off
the team.i miss anything?

513
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,000
oh,yeah,the one where he had
nothing to do with mike's death.

514
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,860
- i didn't. i swear.
- they didn't just kick you off the team.

515
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,270
they took away your scholarship.

516
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,610
you didn't keep up your
grades,so they sent you packing.

517
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,370
it was all mike's fault.

518
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,920
your best friend betrayed you.

519
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,270
no way he did that.he stood up for me.

520
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,170
the thing with mike is that
he thought with his heart.

521
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,560
told the truth,

522
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,130
and that can get you into
trouble with some people.

523
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,720
hey,hold on.

524
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,310
taking away my scholarship,too.

525
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,550
together we stand,my ass.

526
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,790
i'm sorry,breeze.

527
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,910
- i didn't mean to do...
- it's not your fault,man.

528
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,000
just... just bad luck.

529
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,390

530
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,130

flunking.your beowulf paper was due this morning.

531
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,480
- i turned it in.
- you were supposed to give it to me.

532
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,740
it's half your grade.you get an
f,i'm the one who takes the heat.

533
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,480
i got a team meeting.

534
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,590
the same team who just took
away the halfback scholarship?

535
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,920
he gets sick,all of a sudden
they got a problem with his gpa?

536
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,600
that's a mistake i'm gonna fix.
i'll get breeze back on the team.

537
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,060
a mistake?

538
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,550
come on,mad dog,those 'roids
are clouding your head.

539
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,110
i'm not on steroids,you little maggot.

540
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,670
so you become a warrior,and
suddenly you're benching 400 pounds?

541
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,920
you don't know what
you're talking about.

542
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,660
no,it's simple,mike.

543
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,390
you pass,you play. team
wins,school makes money.

544
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,290
everybody's happy. that's how it works.

545
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,610
you're a dollar bill to them.

546
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,070
you're the one getting paid here.

547
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,530
and if i flunk,you're done.

548
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,320
i'm a dollar bill to you.

549
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,510
don't worry about me.

550
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,740
i got a life after college.

551
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,340
i wonder what would happen
to your stupid fellowship

552
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,920
if they knew you cheated
for football players.

553
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,900
that kid was pissed off.

554
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,810
you're saying nerd bashed
the fullback's head in?

555
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,510
doesn't take much to
sneak up on somebody.

556
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,570
that takes a coward,right,breeze?and
it is about you.

557
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,950
moon took away your football career.

558
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,800
i was in the emergency
room all day that saturday.

559
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,880
the doctors were trying
to save my kidney.

560
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,660
the same kidney made worse
by the steroids they fed you.

561
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,360
- yeah.
- it's the way they treated you.

562
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,780
how could you work there?

563
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,890
it's the only thing i got.

564
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,940
i tell you what.

565
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,330
in that backfield with moon...

566
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,210
still the best days of my life.

567
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,010
quit shoving me,man!i got rights!

568
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,970
can it or i tighten the bracelets.

569
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,820
who's she?

570
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,110
detective rush. she's cool.

571
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,360
well,then get these
damn things off me,man.

572
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,460
that glorious stench?chanel
dumpster no. 5.

573
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,990
that's all right.captain says you're gonna
remember what it's like to stink real soon.

574
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,250
you going someplace,saccardo?

575
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,100
joint operation with the feds
coming down.just waiting to hear.

576
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,100
send me a postcard.

577
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,830
uh,yeah,no,i'm not kidding.

578
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,210
it's about the hit-and-run
report you filed 30 years ago.

579
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,530
yeah,a red duster hit your car near
the university around 10:00 a.m.

580
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,560
yeah.

581
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,740
did you get a look at the driver?

582
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,790
uh,it says in the report the duster
that hit your car had no plates.

583
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,810
dealer plates or no plates?

584
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,490
um,my assistant wants to know
if they were dealer plates.

585
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,100
yeah. thanks,pal.

586
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,720
dealer plates.

587
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,170
suspect was fleeing the scene
in a brand-spanking-new car.

588
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,930
let's find us a duster.

589
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,080
so how'd you afford grad
school with no loans?

590
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,150
what does this have to
do with mike mcshane?

591
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,760
mike was gonna tell those fancy
scholarship guys you were a cheat.

592
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,390
you knew after mike left the tickets,he'd
take the shortcut back to the dorm.

593
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,730
you wait for him,professor?

594
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,980
- if you think...
- we think...

595
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,910
you saw mike again.

596
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,460
bashed the guy's head in.

597
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,290
all right,i was mad at him!

598
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,280
maybe it was my fault.

599
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,980
- your fault?
- if i just hadn't,

600
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,230
i don't know,shined the light...

601
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,510
maybe he'd be alive.

602
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,390
("blue sky" playing)

603
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,540
i just met with a doctor in town.

604
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,000
he said i had signs of liver damage.

605
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,540
side effect of steroids.

606
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,430
i can't believe they did this to me.

607
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,870
to all of us.

608
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,090
i should have listened to you

609
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,360
- about a lot of things.
- i don't know anything.

610
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,600
i stopped by your english prof's office.

611
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,240
just graded your beowulf paper.

612
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,560
- how bad was it?
- got a b+ all on your own.

613
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,520
no way.

614
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,750
maybe i should have listened to you.

615
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,320
don't get all sappy
on me,you little twerp.

616
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,080
- you still gonna play tomorrow?
- why?

617
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,830
just figured maybe you weren't gonna
be playing for those idiots anymore.

618
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,490
fall football...

619
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,330
chill in the air,

620
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,300
pads cracking,fans screaming,

621
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,170
going so hard you think you
might die,but then you don't.

622
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,480
they can't take that away.

623
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,010
let him who may win glory
before death: for that is best.

624
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,350
at last for the departed warrior.

625
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,430
you really did read it.

626
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,630
i'll leave you tickets for the game.

627
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,460
hey... i thought of a nickname for you.

628
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,040
i was gonna go with
"bones,"but then it hit me...

629
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,130
wiglaf.

630
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,250
thanks,bad moon.

631
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,560
wiglaf. that's from beowulf.

632
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:34,240
yeah,the only warrior who
stood by beowulf at the end.

633
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,230
helped him slay the dragon.

634
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,990
- mike's way of saying thanks.
- i guess so.

635
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,150
did mike tell you what he was gonna do?

636
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:46,400
he said he was gonna talk to
coach walters about breeze.

637
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,470
thought he'd never have
the chance,but now...

638
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,740
you think mike stood up to walters.

639
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,370
would have been the
first,that's for sure.

640
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,590
you got a lot to answer for,coach,

641
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,930
treating those players
like disposable meat.

642
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,020
they were treated like kings.

643
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,490
yeah?

644
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,590
breeze,too?

645
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,890
breeze got sick.

646
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,630
because of your steroid program.

647
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,130
mike ever come to you,to talk about it?

648
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,930
yeah,he came to me. friday night.

649
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,950
not saturday morning.that's
convenient for you.

650
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,630
i was with the coaching
staff all saturday morning.

651
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,380
then about 70,000 witnesses
saw me on the sidelines.

652
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,710
why don't you call one?

653
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,430
you like that,don't you?

654
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,420
fans cheering.

655
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,520
all that glory on saturdays.

656
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,570
bet you'd do anything to keep it.

657
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,250
anything to shut mike up.

658
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,400
- i didn't kill mike.
- then what did you say to him?

659
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,570
not a hell of a lot...

660
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,710
but with breeze off the
team,he loses his scholarship.

661
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,990
if he can't keep his grades up...

662
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,950
but that was never a problem
when he was starting. was it?

663
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,850
he's given everything to the team.

664
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,180
i mean,together we stand,right,coach?

665
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,160
finished?

666
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,970
- i-i just think that we need to...
- get the hell out of my office.

667
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,330
- you don't give a rat's ass about us,do you?
- watch yourself,boy.

668
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:24,990
walk away

669
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,100
before you lose your
own damn scholarship.

670
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,840
- you'd do that,wouldn't you?
- put your pads on tomorrow

671
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,880
and be a warrior.

672
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,810
i will never put on a
warrior jersey again,

673
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,660
you son of a bitch.

674
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,510
and you let that stand?

675
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,970
he would've played.

676
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,510
they always do.

677
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,190
besides...

678
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,790
...not my job to mollycoddle players.

679
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,370
now,that's what the
boosters are for,right?

680
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,790
take 'em to dinner,slip
the players cash.

681
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,850
- handle a mess like mike.
- your point?

682
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,220
steve pratt did the dirty work.

683
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,380
you called him,right?

684
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,940
after all these years,still
beholden to steve pratt.

685
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,600
you needed your new stadium,right?

686
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,450
this used to be a game,coach.

687
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,810
you ever miss that?

688
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,280
george!

689
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,840
you folks being helped?

690
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,570
steve pratt sent us.

691
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,440
why didn't you say so?

692
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,810
you affiliated with the program?

693
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,410
class of '92.

694
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,330
looking for a duster.

695
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,540
they stopped making those in the '70s.

696
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,430
we used to sell a ton of 'em.

697
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,320
steve said he test-drove
in one once. that true?

698
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,590
sure.the players loved 'em.

699
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,740
tell us more.

700
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,460
looked you up in some old
warrior programs,steve.

701
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,840
can't seem to find your game stats.

702
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,270
well,i was on the team.

703
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,160
we went to the orange bowl.

704
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,800
but you never played.

705
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,250
does that even count?

706
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,220
it counts.

707
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,080
well,you've been pretending you're
somebody else for a long time

708
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,690
'cause you were nothing like bad moon.

709
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,050
well,you were... warming the bench.

710
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,670
together we... sit.

711
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,550
you two... don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

712
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,720
mike was like a son to you.

713
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,840
must have stung when he
said he was leaving the team.

714
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,150
he was his own man.

715
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,710
you try and talk to him? i
mean he must have come to you.

716
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,910
if it was... just a
talking-to,that we can understand.

717
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,710
i had a chat with your buddy at the
dodge dealership over in roxborough.

718
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,930
he lent you a red duster
the morning mike was killed.

719
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,560
same one you returned
after the hit-and-run.

720
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,120
you know,there's gotta be some mistake.

721
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,510
no mistake.

722
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,800
got a tailgater who id'd you driving
away from the crime scene at 9:30.

723
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,970
well,i can go get our witness right now.

724
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,100
they'll put you through
a lineup,lie detector...

725
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,280
up to you.

726
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,050
you took him for a drive just...to talk.

727
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,660
right? to...work it out.

728
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,850
you always had a way with
those kids,didn't you?

729
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,360
just... went for a drive to talk.

730
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,840
you were the father he never had.

731
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,050
always tried to be there for him.

732
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,110
well,you gave everything to mike.

733
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,940
you rescued him from his small town.

734
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:59,540
yeah. you threw parties.you
took him to fancy restaurants.

735
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,730
you made that kid.

736
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,570
i treated him like a son.

737
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,530
and how does mike thank you?

738
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,390
stirring up trouble.

739
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,980
- going behind your back.
- the coach calls you to fix it.

740
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,600
that's your job: to take care of it.

741
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,790
well,mike starts
talking,you lose everything.

742
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,580
and the games,the parties...

743
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,660
a son.

744
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,100
i tried.

745
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,890
i tried to tell him not to do it.

746
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,950
not to do what,steve?

747
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,660
tell us what happened,steve.

748
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,920
tell us so you don't have
to live with this anymore.

749
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,100
god help me.

750
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,890
well...i was gonna wait
till after the game,but...

751
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,760
that's all yours,son.

752
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,880
you deserve it.

753
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,250
imagine driving through
campus in this baby.

754
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,400
pretty blonde riding shotgun...

755
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,830
you think this is about a car?

756
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,160
what?

757
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,560
don't you get it?you're
ruining the game i love.

758
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,880
- you're thinking too much,mike.
- you don't want me to think.

759
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,750
you pump us full of
steroids without telling us.

760
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,600
- those things help you.
- it's cheating.

761
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,380
it isn't right.

762
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,690
look,i came here to play
ball and get a degree.

763
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,870
well,guess what? you don't
play,you don't get a degree.

764
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,990
- okay? so buck up.
- my grades are good.

765
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,130
- i can get a scholarship anywhere in the country.
- mike,come on. okay?

766
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,970
nobody's talking about you leaving here.

767
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,130
i'm not staying unless breeze does,

768
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,350
unless certain things change.

769
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,950
oh,my god. what the
hell is wrong with you?

770
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,770
do you have any idea how lucky you are?

771
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,860
- how stupid you're being right now?
- i trusted you.

772
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,070
you know,i-i actually th...

773
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,170
i was wrong.

774
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,400
oh,what,about me? is
that what you're saying?

775
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,050
i discovered you.

776
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,650
okay? i made you everything you are.you'd
still be pumping gas back in latrobe.

777
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,540
- that's not true.
- you've eaten at my table.

778
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,330
you never said no to a freebie,did you?

779
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,820
$50 here,$50 there.

780
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,800
- that was for books.
- you think this is easy?

781
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,690
everything i do for
you? for all my boys?

782
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,230
- your boys?
- yeah!

783
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,120
your boys think you're a joke.

784
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,340
- what'd you say?
- you're a benchwarmer.

785
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,430
- you're trying to relive glory you never had in the first place.
- you..!!

786
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,750
- shut your mouth.
- no! if you're what being a warrior is,

787
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,410
forget it.
