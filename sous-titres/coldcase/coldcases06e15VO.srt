1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Come on, Mom.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,500
You know I'll get more out of college

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,800
if I take a year off first.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,100
A lot can change
in a year, Jeff.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,700
People lose perspective.

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,100
Lose perspective?

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,400
You're talking
to the class president,

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,600
captain of the track team,

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,200
4P0-meter dash
state record holder.

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,800
Save it, Carl Lewis.

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,500
So what do you plan to do
during this so-called

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,700
self-enlightening sabbatical?

13
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,300
Travel.

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,200
I'm going to backpack around

15
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,500
and get jobs when
I run out of money.

16
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
What kind of jobs?

17
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,800
A clue for the
less enlightened.

18
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,300
Uh, teaching English
in Beijing...

19
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,100
picking artichokes
in Spain...

20
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,200
That sounds very romantic.

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,100
But what's wrong with a semester
abroad once you're at Cornell?

22
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,500
Well, you don't go abroad
until you're a junior.

23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,900
That's four years away.

24
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,500
And I'm burnt out now.

25
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,100
You don't want me turning into
some mental case, do you, Mom?

26
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,200
You care to weigh
in here, Ben?

27
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,600
Are you even listening?

28
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,400
Yeah.

29
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,000
Artichokes.

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,500
The first time
you're home for dinner,

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,700
you're not really home.

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,200
He's 17. He doesn't have

33
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,800
to figure out his future
before dessert.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,300
We got to go.

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Honey?

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,800
This is Tom Parker.

37
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,200
He's, uh...

38
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,500
he's a US Marshal.

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,000
A US Marshal?

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,700
- What's going on?
- Dad?

41
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,600
You can use these to pack.

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,900
Pack what?

43
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,300
Whatever you want
to take with you.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,800
Where are we going?

45
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,600
I don't understand.
What's going on, Mom?

46
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,900
Ben, talk to me.

47
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,900
Tom's gonna help us.

48
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,800
Everything's
going to be fine.

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,100
But we need
to go.

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,500
Now.

51
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,400
<i>It's a specialized system.</i>

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,900
Not some push-and-play you get at the mall.
9:10 AM

53
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,400
You're not going
to let this go, are you?

54
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,800
Lil, explain to Nick when you're
a guest in someone's home,

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,600
you treat it like a castle.

56
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,000
Trouble in paradise?

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
I accidentally
put a beer down

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,200
on one of King Arthur's
speakers here,

59
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,000
for which I've apologized.

60
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,200
Multiple times.

61
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,500
First of all, it's
a tube amp, not a speaker.

62
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,500
And you not only used it
as a coaster, you moved it.

63
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,600
Maybe two inches.

64
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,700
Yeah, sent the acoustics
straight to hell

65
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,900
<i>and warped
my Benny Carter vinyl.</i>

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,200
Two words for you guys:
couples counseling.

67
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,600
I'm Detective Rush.

68
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,700
Can I help you?

69
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,900
My son Jeff--

70
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,700
I don't know where he is.

71
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,100
He left for school yesterday.
He never came back.

72
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,600
He's not answering
his cell phone.

73
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,300
I'm sorry, ma'am.
This is Homicide.

74
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,000
I brought his computer 'cause...

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We're not Missing Persons.

76
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,100
I can walk you over there
if you'd like.

77
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,200
They told me downstairs

78
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,900
that you deal with old murders,
and, um...

79
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,200
I found this in my son's room.

80
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,500
And I don't know how long
he's had it.

81
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,100
"Body of six-foot
Caucasian male, brown hair,

82
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,000
"believed to be
in his early 40s,

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,500
"found in the Schuylkill
September 24, 2008.

84
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,600
Victim wearing jeans
and a gray T-shirt..."

85
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,100
It was an R.E.M.
concert T-shirt.

86
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,800
This is... this
has to be Ben.

87
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,900
This is about my husband,
Ben Feldman.

88
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,900
You're saying your son's missing
and your husband was murdered?

89
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,100
I sound like a lunatic.

90
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,100
I'm not.

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,500
Where did you think your husband
was all this time?

92
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,600
We didn't know.
We just... we just kept hoping

93
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,200
that he would come
walking through the door.

94
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,600
Who would've wanted
to kill him?

95
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,900
My husband was
an accountant.

96
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,200
He was about to testify against
someone in organized crime.

97
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,600
Organized crime?

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,100
Someone in Philly?

99
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,900
No, Providence.

100
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,400
Freddy Ghiacconi.

101
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,600
You saying you're in WITSEC?
Witness Protection?

102
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,800
That's why we moved to Philly.

103
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,000
You contact WITSEC when
your husband went missing?

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No, I don't trust them anymore.

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,600
Please...

106
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,000
Detective, I already lost
my husband.

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,800
I don't want to lose
my son, too.

108
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:48,700
COLD CASE 
Season 06 - Episode 15
 WITNESS PROTECTION

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
on September 24, 2008.

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,900
MEs estimate it'd been
in the water two to three days.

112
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,300
Tracks with
what Leigh said.

113
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,900
Ben disappeared
September 21.

114
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,700
Concert T-shirt.

115
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,600
<i>Automatic for the People.</i>

116
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,100
Vintage R.E.M.

117
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,900
It was a .380
to the back of the head.

118
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,600
Ain't how you expect
an accountant to go down.

119
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,200
Well, Ben took on a client
who ended up being connected.

120
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,500
Next thing you know,
he's doing the books

121
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,700
for Freddy
"The Ice Man" Ghiacconi.

122
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,900
Once you're in...

123
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,000
There's only one way out.

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,900
Gotta talk to this Ghiacconi.

125
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,500
Know where to find him.
His trial's been going on

126
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,600
for the last four months
up in Providence.

127
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,400
Probably got an army
of lawyers.

128
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,300
Hey, what'd Leigh tell you
about Ben's last moves?

129
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,300
Well, they were in
Cape May on the 21st.

130
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,700
Ben went to Philly that night
to get money out of a locker

131
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,400
at 30th Street Station.

132
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,700
Guy afraid of banks?

133
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,300
Gonna want to check
security tapes.

134
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,800
Well, he would've had to drive.

135
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,000
Probably take the Garden State

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
to the Ben Franklin or Walt Whitman.

137
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,700
Those cameras at the bridges
should be able to get

138
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,200
a timed photo of Ben
coming through.
Yeah.

139
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,700
Wanna check impounds,
see if his car turned up?

140
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,500
Just got back from the morgue.

141
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,100
Keep John Does
on ice for a year,

142
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,400
and get this:
Ben's body was ID'd yesterday.

143
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,100
By who?

144
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,300
His son, Jeff.

145
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,400
He's in Philly.

146
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,000
And he's alive.

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,900
Least he was
at 4:00 yesterday.

148
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,900
Morgue attendant said
the first thing he asked

149
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,300
about a body found in the river
was what kind of gun was used.

150
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Already knew it was
a gunshot wound.

151
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,000
We got to find that kid,
see what else he knows.

152
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,500
Hey, you Curtis Bell?

153
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,300
Yup. Who are you?

154
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,400
I'm Detective Rush.
You've been ducking me.

155
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,300
He look church-ready to you?

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,400
Squeaky clean.

157
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,000
Shot his grandma for her
Social Security check last year.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
Now he's my eyewitness

159
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,300
in a drive-by.

160
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,600
So, uh, what'd
you call about?

161
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,100
Second or third time?

162
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,700
Yeah, I don't really
do voice mail.

163
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,400
I need your approval
for a warrant

164
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,400
for a missing kid's cell phone--
GPS or any data.

165
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,200
GPS--
they have

166
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,900
that kind of thing
on cell phones now?

167
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,700
Yeah, they do.

168
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,700
Scotty, Agent Tom Parker.

169
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,900
Hey.

170
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,000
Have a seat.

171
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,700
So what's this about?

172
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,600
A witness of yours, Ben Feldman.

173
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,200
Accountant who was supposed
to testify

174
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,300
against Freddy Ghiacconi.

175
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,700
Yeah, washed up
in the Schuylkill

176
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,900
in September-- gunshot.

177
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,200
Oh, wow.

178
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,700
Guy goes missing--
you bother to investigate?

179
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,400
Well, the trail went cold.

180
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,800
I have more witnesses
than I can handle.

181
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,700
And then we'd already
videotaped his testimony.

182
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,100
You think Ghiacconi
had him killed?

183
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Well, it'd certainly
lighten his load.

184
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,500
Ghiacconi's been in the ACI
since June.

185
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Trial started November 1,

186
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,500
and it's still going on.

187
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,900
Ben was your witness,

188
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,100
and killed on your watch.
How's that happen?

189
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,200
Witnesses are unpredictable.

190
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,400
You should know that.

191
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,300
Don't always play
by the rules.

192
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,100
Something going on
with the family?

193
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,900
The usual chaos.
People enter WITSEC,

194
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,700
they have to leave old friends,
old lives behind forever.

195
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,900
Listen...

196
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,300
I can only set people up,

197
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,000
I can't make them stay...

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
Where were you born, Jeff?

199
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,200
Ames, Iowa.

200
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,500
What brought you to
Philadelphia, Leigh?

201
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,100
My husband had an opportunity
in online accounting.

202
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,800
Can I at least call my mother?

203
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,700
Do you know what

204
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,000
she must be going through?
We disappeared into thin air.

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,500
It's safer for her,

206
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
for all of us,

207
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
if no one knows
where we are, Leigh.

208
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,500
You'll do anything to avoid
my mother, won't you?

209
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,000
And what about
Jeff's education?

210
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,000
How is he going
to get into Cornell

211
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
with two last names?

212
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,300
Two transcripts?

213
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,000
Starting tomorrow,
he'll be attending

214
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,200
St. Xavier High School.

215
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,600
Um... we're Jewish.

216
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,300
Not in Philadelphia
you're not.

217
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,300
You're not a sprinter
anymore, either.

218
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,100
You're too fast,
it'll raise questions.

219
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,900
What?

220
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,300
Dad!

221
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Is that really necessary?

222
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,600
Jeff's not the witness. I am.

223
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,300
The whole family's vulnerable.

224
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,800
I'm trying to keep
you alive here.

225
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,900
Right.

226
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,300
Cross-country

227
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,100
ain't so bad.

228
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,900
The great
outdoors, right?

229
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,600
And now that we're Catholic,

230
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,000
I can have that Christmas tree
I always wanted.

231
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,100
Don't worry, Leigh.

232
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,800
Jeff will get used to it.

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,200
What if he doesn't?

234
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,400
They were good people.

235
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,800
They're different from the
criminals I usually protect.

236
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
Sounds like you
got close to them.

237
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,800
You said the "whole
family's vulnerable."

238
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,400
Jeff got something
on Ghiacconi?

239
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Leigh said Jeff used
to help his father

240
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,200
in the office on weekends--
might have seen something.

241
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,100
What does Jeff have
to do with this?

242
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,000
He went missing yesterday.

243
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,400
Where's Leigh?

244
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Tom?

245
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,700
Leigh.

246
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,500
I'm sorry about Ben.

247
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah.

248
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,700
They told me Jeff's missing.

249
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
You know, you
could've called.

250
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,500
It's not your fault.

251
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,600
If there's anything

252
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,800
I can do, you know
how to reach me.

253
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Did you hear anything
about Jeff yet?

254
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,400
A technician's looking
at his computer.

255
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,500
We're tracking the GPS
on his cell phone.

256
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,700
Still nothing.

257
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
He stay in touch with
any of his old friends?

258
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,000
Anyone you can think of
he might have gone to see?

259
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,500
I've been wracking my brain.

260
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,400
There's no one
for him to go to.

261
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,300
No family, friends?

262
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,000
After we joined WITSEC, we cut
off everyone we'd ever known.

263
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,900
Jeff never got close
to anyone after that.

264
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,000
It was just the two of us.

265
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,100
We bh knew
Ghiacconi got to him.

266
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,800
Neither of us wanted

267
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,600
to say it out loud,
afraid it'd make it true, so...

268
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,800
He mentioned
Jeff might have

269
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,900
met Ghiacconi at Ben's office,
the weekends he was there.

270
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,700
Any other interactions
between them

271
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,500
you know about?

272
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,100
He ever come over
to the house,

273
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,500
socialize with the family?

274
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,100
No.

275
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,800
No.

276
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,600
I made Ben
keep business separate.

277
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,400
He spent so much time

278
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,100
at the office
as it was.

279
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,600
Relocation must have
been hard on Jeff.

280
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
Sounds crazy, but...

281
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,400
going into WITSEC actually
brought us closer.

282
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,900
Hadn't felt like a family
in so long.

283
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,400
Go, Jeff! Jeff!

284
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,300
Jeff!

285
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,500
So much for
not attracting attention.

286
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,800
Carl Lewis. Can't remember
the last time I saw him run.

287
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,500
Wonder who
he's trying to impress.

288
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,000
Now I get it.
The reason he spent

289
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,500
an hour this morning
primping for

290
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,300
an 8K through the woods.

291
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Know your son better
than you think.

292
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,200
He looks like himself again.

293
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,400
Tom says kids
bounce back faster.

294
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,300
Yeah, yeah.

295
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,500
Shorter memories.

296
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,200
Am I crazy, or do you maybe
hate me a little less?

297
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,000
You have your moments.

298
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,100
But don't push it, Foster.

299
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,400
Everything I put
our family through...

300
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,800
If ever there were a reason
for you  oalk k aw...

301
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,100
...it means the world to me
that you didn't.

302
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's go congratulate Jeff.

303
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,000
Go find Jeff.

304
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,900
We need to go now.

305
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,900
just when we had a chance
to be a family again,

306
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,100
we were back on the run.

307
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,500
Who was the guy?

308
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,400
Vinnie, um, Buonaforte.

309
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,000
Ghiacconi's driver.

310
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,300
He took Ghiacconi
to all his meetings

311
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,500
at Ben's office.

312
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,900
Any idea how he found you?

313
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,400
No.

314
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
As soon as Ben saw him,
we drove to Cape May.

315
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,900
Why Cape May?
Place where we had
our honeymoon.

316
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,800
Ben loved the Jersey Shore.

317
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,800
We'd walk for hours
on the beach.

318
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,400
That the same night Ben came
back to Philly for the money?

319
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,500
I figured if he went late
at night, he'd be safe.

320
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,300
That was the last time
I saw him.

321
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,500
Oh, detectives.

322
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
US Attorney in Rhode Island
got me up to speed

323
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,100
on Vinnie Brown.
You mean Buonaforte.

324
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,600
Brown, Buonaforte.

325
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,400
Tomato, tom-ah-to.

326
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,700
This says Brown.

327
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Oh, oh.

328
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,200
Sorry, I must have grabbed
the wrong file.

329
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,700
Address matches and so
do the fingerprints.

330
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Uh, Vinnie Brown.

331
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,000
Arrested for burglary
in Camden a month ago.

332
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,800
Jacked a bunch
of flat screens.

333
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,500
Do any time?

334
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,600
Charges were dropped at the
insistence of the US Attorney.

335
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,200
That normal--
US Attorney getting involved

336
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,500
in a small-time burglary?

337
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,700
Happens every...
uh, never.

338
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,200
Oh, federal interference,
a name change.

339
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,700
Sounds like Ben wasn't the only
one in Witness Protection.

340
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,100
Bingo.
But here's the ass-kicker.

341
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,600
Feds snapped this guy's picture
in Providence,

342
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,100
August '08.

343
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,100
That's five months after

344
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,400
he was relocated to Philly.
Check it out.

345
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
We had the Ice Man.

346
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,500
Now we got the Dice Man.

347
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,700
So this
Vinnie Buonaforte's

348
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,300
in WITSEC with the feds,

349
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,200
but working for Ghiacconi
in Providence?

350
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Playing both sides.

351
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,000
Maybe he tries to earn
a few stripes with Ghiacconi.

352
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,100
Ah, takes out the feds'
star witness against him.

353
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,500
Sure you don't want me
to brew up some chamomile?

354
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,400
Got a cupboard
full of the stuff.

355
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,300
My daughter's trying to
knock my cholesterol down.

356
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,500
When are you scheduled
to testify against

357
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,200
Freddy Ghiacconi, Vinnie?

358
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,000
Just waiting for the call.

359
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,700
Thought you two were here
to prep me.

360
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,800
Still keep ties with
your old pals in Providence?

361
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,300
You kidding?

362
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,400
They want my head
on their living room wall.

363
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
So how'd the feds get

364
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,700
this pretty picture
of your mug in August?

365
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,700
Missed my old bakery.

366
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,000
People down here,
they don't know

367
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,700
a cannoli from a cruller.

368
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,300
We're supposed to believe you'd
risk your life for a pastry?

369
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,600
It's true.

370
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,700
WITSEC gave me a second chance.
I took it.

371
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,800
I'm a suburban dad now.

372
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,400
I-I punch a clock
at a paper company.

373
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,900
I-I play video games
with my daughter.

374
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,700
I drive a friggin' minivan.

375
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,900
Tell us about the last time

376
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,100
you saw Ben Feldman,
the Ice Man's accountant.

377
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,900
Ben Feldman.

378
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,800
This is about that?

379
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,000
Answer the question,
Mr. Cannoli.

380
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,500
I saw Ben...

381
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,000
had to be... over a year ago,

382
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,200
back when I was
driving Freddy.

383
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,000
Ben was good people.

384
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,700
He always offered me coffee
every time I brought Freddy by.

385
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,100
Uh, and in a mug, too.

386
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,000
Wasn't some Styrofoam situation.

387
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,200
We know you tracked Ben down

388
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,900
at a cross-country meet
in September.

389
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,300
Why you lying
to us, Vinnie?

390
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,300
Right, right.

391
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,800
I-I forgot about that.

392
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,100
Selective memory
will get you hauled downtown.

393
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,200
I was there
watching my daughter run.

394
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,100
Her school was racing
against Ben's kid's.

395
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,500
Ah, that's some coincidence.

396
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,100
Right, right.

397
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,200
I admit, uh, it threw me
when I ran into him.

398
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,500
Been forever since
I seen a familiar face.

399
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,900
Hey, Ben, nice
to see you again.

400
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,500
You run 'cause
of little old me?

401
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,500
If you could see

402
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,100
the look on
your face.

403
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,400
When I saw you at the race,

404
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,200
I thought, "Crap,
he's gonna call Freddy,

405
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
tell him where I am."

406
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,900
Then I realized,
you're his friggin' accountant.

407
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,400
Probably in WITSEC, too.

408
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Since February.

409
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,100
March for me.

410
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
I'm Vinnie Brown now.

411
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,900
<i>My nonna must be rolling
in her grave.</i>

412
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,700
What's this?

413
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,300
Zeppole from Scialo's.

414
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,200
I sneak back
every few weeks,

415
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
get a fix.

416
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
You live in Philly?

417
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,300
Camden.

418
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,700
Wife hit the bricks
when I flipped.

419
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,700
It's just me
and my daughter Tammy.

420
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,100
She was racing this morning.

421
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,400
That's why you were at the meet?

422
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,900
You scared the hell out of me.

423
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,200
What, you follow us home?

424
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,800
Eh, figured you wouldn't notice
me in my beautiful minivan.

425
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,400
Where's the wife and kid?

426
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,900
Waiting in the car.

427
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
<i>Six months ago,
I'm a big spacone.</i>

428
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,600
Freddy and I had box seats
to all the games,

429
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,200
ate at Capreech's every night.

430
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,800
Now I'm waiting
in line at Costco.

431
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,200
It's weird, huh?

432
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,500
Pretending your whole life
don't exist before a year ago.

433
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,000
It isn't all bad.

434
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,200
I see my family more.

435
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,900
Yeah, yeah.

436
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,200
I could never have got through
this without my daughter Tammy.

437
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,000
She's a hell
of a kid.

438
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,600
Makes a chicken piccata
to die for.

439
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Biggest gripe's with my marshal;
guy practically babysits us.

440
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,900
Yeah? I never see my guy.

441
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,900
He even built shelves
for my wife's cookbooks.

442
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,400
That ain't right.

443
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,800
There's only room for one set
of power tools in the house.

444
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm just saying I wouldn't want

445
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,400
some other guy
in my wife's kitchen.

446
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,300
Where were you that night?

447
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,600
<i>Had to be home, watching
High School Musical with Tammy.</i>

448
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,200
Did after every race.

449
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,400
A ritual type thing.

450
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,800
There she is.

451
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,000
Hi, Daddy.

452
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,000
My daughter Tammy.

453
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,300
Straight A's
at Villanova.

454
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,000
Talk about the apple
falling far from the tree.

455
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,600
Cool it on the zeppole runs,
Vinnie.

456
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
Bad for your health.

457
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,600
Found articles on the Ghiacconi
trial on Jeff Foster's computer.

458
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,500
id was checking
every day for updates.

459
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,100
Oh, anything
on his e-mail accounts?

460
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,300
Uh, just got around his password
a few minutes ago.

461
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,700
Any luck
with the GPS?

462
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,300
Nah, nothing yet.

463
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,000
Looking for
the only teenager in America

464
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
not addicted to his cell phone.

465
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,400
Hey, uh, I got tickets
to the Sixers game tonight.

466
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,900
Uh, I-I can't.

467
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,700
Sorry.

468
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,600
Hot date or...?

469
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,700
Look, Scotty,

470
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,600
Billy and I...

471
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Yeah?

472
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,900
We're gonna give it
another shot.

473
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,300
Another shot.

474
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,400
Just like that?

475
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
Family's been all over us.

476
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,000
They even brought in
the priests.

477
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,900
I been married six years.

478
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,100
I never put in any effort,
you know?

479
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
Walk away now, you never
know what could've been.

480
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,700
Yeah, no.

481
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,800
Hey... do what you got to do.

482
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,900
Right?

483
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,500
So we're cool?

484
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah.

485
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,300
We're cool.

486
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,800
Feds make a habit of putting
witnesses who know each other

487
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,300
in the same plac Tom?

488
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,600
Vinnie was in Camden.
Ben was in Philly.

489
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,500
We needed them close
for the trial.

490
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,200
Close enough
where their kids

491
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
run in the same
cross-country league?

492
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,800
Do witnesses sometimes
run into each other?

493
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Sure.

494
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,200
It's happened before.
It'll happen again.

495
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,900
Tom...

496
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
I noticed Leigh called you that.

497
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
All of your witnesses
call you by your first name?

498
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,700
Some.
Much of a
handyman,

499
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,800
Tom?

500
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,600
Uh, no, not really.

501
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,300
Heard you build
a mean cookbook shelf.

502
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,200
Kept an eyonon
Ben's family,

503
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,400
always checking
in, uh...

504
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,900
They were good
people, right?

505
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,800
That's what I said.

506
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,900
You and Leigh close?

507
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,300
She was having
a hard time adjusting.

508
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,000
I was a shoulder to cry on.

509
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,100
Give her more
than your shoulder?

510
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
I'm not going to answer that.

511
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,100
Not very good at your
job, are you, Tom?

512
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,200
Some issues with boundaries?

513
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,600
Where were you the night
Ben disappeared, Tom?

514
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,200
I was on a plane

515
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
transporting a
witness to Ohio.

516
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,700
What I don't understand...

517
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,600
If Ben was a key witness
in Ghiacconi's trial,

518
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,700
why did you let
him leave WITSEC?

519
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,800
I didn't have much choice.

520
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,700
Got here as fast
as I could.

521
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,500
What's going on?

522
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,700
I just saw Vinnie Buonaforte

523
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,200
at Jeff's cross-country meet.

524
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,800
I practically
had a heart attack.

525
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Vinnie's a witness, too.

526
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,000
You said you would
protect my family.

527
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,600
And I will.

528
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,400
Who are we going to run
into next? Huh?

529
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,800
Ghiacconi's inrnist?t?
His tailor?

530
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,000
I am done. I'm out.

531
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,500
I'm going to take care
of my family myself.

532
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,000
Ben, come on. You're in no
position to go out on your own.

533
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,800
You need me to sign some
paperwork, I'll do it.

534
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,700
But then I'm gone.

535
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,500
Walk away and we'll prosecute.

536
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Try to stop me
and I'll tell your bosses

537
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,400
you slept with my wife.

538
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,200
Yeah, I thought you'd say that.

539
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,900
You stay the hell away
from my family.

540
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,800
That was the worst mistake
of my life.

541
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,900
Bosses ever find out
about you and Leigh?
Uh, no.

542
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,500
I'd like to keep it that way.

543
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,400
Then you better
start playing ball.

544
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,300
What else haven't you told us?

545
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,100
Before they left WITSEC,

546
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,800
Leigh asked me how
to go about buying a gun.

547
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,200
Where'd you send her?

548
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,600
I sent her to a gun shop
in Quakertown.

549
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,100
she and Jeff fell off the grid
after Ben disappeared.

550
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,200
And after I found out

551
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,300
that she opened a bank account
in Maryland,

552
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
I stopped looking.

553
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,600
You think she might
have killed Ben?
I don't know.

554
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,400
But he took her life
away from her once.

555
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,700
She wasn't gonna let him
take it again.

556
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,200
Crank call?

557
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,900
I'm trying to schedule a sitdown
with Freddy Ghiacconi,

558
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,700
and his lawyers

559
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,800
keep passing me around
like a hot potato.

560
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,200
What is it with you people?

561
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,500
Well, law school teaches
you three things:

562
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,300
delay, deflect,
derail and deny.

563
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,000
That's four.

564
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,900
Your boy Jeff sent a text at
11:00 this morning from Philly.

565
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,100
"On my way," it said.

566
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,200
Who'd it go to?

567
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,000
Recipient's got a
different carrier.

568
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,400
Waiting to hear back.

569
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,500
That's good info.

570
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,700
Where did you get it?

571
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,200
I know a guy knows a guy.

572
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,400
Tech's gonna call
you personally

573
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,900
the minute that
cell goes live.

574
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
help yourself.

575
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,000
Got a thing for
the Ultra Fine Flairs.

576
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,600
Talked to the gun registry.

577
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,800
Leigh bought a .380
a month before Ben disappeared.

578
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,200
Same caliber that killed him.

579
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,600
Feds didn't make Ben pay
for leaving WITSEC...

580
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,300
YEAH, MAYBE LEIGH DID.

581
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,100
Own a gun, Leigh?

582
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,000
What would I need a gun for?

583
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,900
We're wondering the same thing.

584
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,700
No.

585
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,600
Receipt from Yankee
Arms in Quakertown,

586
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,000
dated August 20, 2008.

587
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,800
Want to read the
signature for me?

588
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,100
I was scared.
We needed protection.

589
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,500
You came to us
for help, Leigh.

590
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,900
We're trying to find your son.

591
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,500
Don't need you holding back.

592
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Jeff ran away.
That 'cause of you?

593
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,300
Of course not.

594
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,600
Maybe he found out
about you and Parker?

595
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,200
Or should I call him Tom?

596
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,000
That was a mistake.

597
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,100
Ben and I were gonna put that
behind us, try again.

598
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,500
You lied about the gun

599
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,500
and forgot to tell us
about Parker.

600
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,600
What other surprises you got
for us, Leigh?

601
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,100
I know it looks bad,

602
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,200
but after all
we'd been through...

603
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,900
I still loved my husband.

604
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,400
I found this in your bag.

605
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,700
Did Parker give
this to you?

606
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,400
No. I bought it myself.

607
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,500
Without telling me?

608
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,200
I panicked, thought
we might need it.

609
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,100
I'm going to take care
of our family, Leigh.

610
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,300
Not with guns.

611
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,700
And after today, I believe you.

612
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,500
I know about you and Tom.

613
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,200
Is it over?

614
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,400
Yes.

615
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,200
We can get through this.

616
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,500
Clean slate.

617
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,900
If you still want to.

618
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,100
I'm sorry.

619
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,300
Me, too.

620
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,300
I'm going to go to Philly
tonight and get the money.

621
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,200
If you don't hear from me
by tomorrow night,

622
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,000
you and Jeff go to
Snow Hill, Maryland

623
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,600
for six months, then...

624
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,400
Come on, Leigh.
Then what?

625
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,800
Then Durham, North Carolina.

626
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Stay there five months.

627
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,600
Then Austin, Texas.

628
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,000
The accounts
are all set up.

629
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,400
You'll have
everything you need.

630
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,600
I didn't hear from him,
so I followed the plan.

631
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,400
Where's the gun now?

632
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
In our apartment

633
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,700
in Snow Hill.

634
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,700
It's been there... five months.

635
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,100
When's the last time you saw it?

636
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,600
???

637
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,800
Jeff

638
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
ID'd Ben's body, Leigh.

639
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,200
He's been tracking
Ghiacconi's trial.

640
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,600
Oh, no.

641
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
No, that's not possible.

642
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,100
Jeff's...

643
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,700
He's not a violent kid.

644
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,100
He ever mention going
to Providence?

645
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,500
Snow Hill PD searched
Leigh's apartment.

646
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,200
Couldn't find the gun.

647
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,000
You think Jeff might be taking
it to Providence?

648
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I put out a broadcast
to all the departments

649
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,100
between here and Rhode Island.

650
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,900
Well, call Providence PD.
Tell them they're gonna

651
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,500
need extra uniforms
at the courthouse.

652
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
All right.

653
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,300
I hia dead end

654
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,300
on the photos
of the bridges, Lieutenant.

655
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,300
No sign of Ben's car
coming into Philly.

656
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
What route did you check?

657
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,400
Garden State to the Walt Whitman
and the Ben Franklin.

658
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,200
Ben was lying low,

659
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,800
might've taken the 73 to 130,
come in the back roads.

660
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Try the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge.

661
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,400
I, uh... just got word
from the phone company.

662
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,300
The number Jeff texted
belongs to Tammy Brown.

663
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,300
Vinnie Brown's daughter?

664
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,600
One and only.

665
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,000
Must have been seeing
each other all this time.

666
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,700
Hiding it from
their families.

667
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,300
Get Tammy in here
and grab a car.

668
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,900
You and Will are going
to Providence.

669
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,700
When'd you last see
Jeff Foster, Tammy?

670
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,400
Guess it was
around September.

671
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,200
At a cross-country meet.

672
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,300
You guys hang out much?

673
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,400
No. I barely know him.

674
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,000
That's too bad.

675
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
'Cause you guys got
a lot in common.

676
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,300
You both listen to Arcade Fire,

677
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,400
both want to save
the rain forest.

678
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,000
Both got daddies in WITSEC.

679
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,200
We know he texted you today,
Tammy. Where is he?

680
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,500
Think you're protecting him
by keeping quiet?

681
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,400
I have a constitutional right
to remain silent.

682
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,600
Constitution also says that
if you know someone's going

683
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,000
to commit a crime,
makes you a co-conspirator.

684
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,200
Looking at life in prison,

685
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,300
even if you're not the one
pulls the trigger.

686
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,300
Where is he, Tammy?

687
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,500
I don't know.

688
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,300
He pulls a gun,
the cops at the courthouse

689
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,800
will shoot him dead,
ask questions later.

690
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,100
Los like you're never gonna
see that rain forest,

691
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,800
much less save it.

692
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,300
Break your daddy's heart.

693
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,500
Wait.

694
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,800
I saw him last night.

695
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
We met at a friend's
dorm room.

696
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,400
I can't believe
you're really here.

697
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,600
I'm really here.

698
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,500
I missed you so much.

699
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,300
I sit in class and dreamf all
the places we talked about.

700
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,100
Walking on the beach
in Ko Samui...

701
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,500
Hiking in Nicaragua...

702
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,200
Breakfast in Bali...

703
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,500
Deciding where to go next
by spinning the globe.

704
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,700
We're never going
anywhere, are we?

705
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,600
Yes, we are.

706
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,300
I promise.

707
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,900
What, you're gonna put us
inin semgiant time machine,

708
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,900
rewrite history?

709
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,200
No.

710
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,300
I'm gonna fix things.

711
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,800
I don't want anything bad
to happen to him.

712
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,800
"Fix things."

713
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
He talking about Ghiacconi?

714
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,400
Yes.

715
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,300
Where is Jeff staying
in Providence?

716
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,600
The Pilgrim's Landing Motel.

717
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,400
The shower's still wet.

718
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,200
We just missed him.
Courthouse.

719
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,800
Let's go.

720
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,300
GPS has him
in a two-block radius.

721
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,200
It's got to be Ghiacconi.

722
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,300
Always send the real one
and a dummy.

723
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,400
Ice, ice, baby.

724
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,400
He's on the move, Scotty.

725
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,300
Heading north
toward the courthouse.

726
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,100
Send him a text.

727
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,100
Scotty, gray hoodie and jeans.
That's him.

728
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,800
No! What are you doing?!

729
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,700
Keep your head down, mouth shut
and legs moving. Come on.

730
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,500
Give it up, Jeff.

731
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,000
You ain't going nowhere.

732
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,200
Who are you?!

733
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,100
Philly PD.

734
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,600
Trying to save your life, stop
you from doing something stupid.

735
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,800
My father was the star witness
against that goombah.

736
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,700
He kills my dad,

737
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,100
and now he's gonna walk?
Your dad

738
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,800
videotaped his deposition.

739
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,600
Ghiacconi's not going anywhere.

740
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,200
He needs to pay
for what he did!

741
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,100
And what, you spend
the rest of your life in jail?

742
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,000
It'd be worth it.

743
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Son, you may think
you want revenge,

744
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,900
but trust me,
just tears you up.

745
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,000
What do you know about it?

746
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,700
I been there.

747
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,900
I just wanted
to make things right.

748
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,800
Until Ghiacconi's behind bars,
we have to keep moving.

749
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,400
So it could be like this
for years?

750
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,000
I hope not,
but I don't know.

751
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,700
Isn't this where
you're supposed to
tell me not to worry?

752
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,200
You've got it
all worked out?

753
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
You're too old
for fairy tales.

754
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,300
I wish
Ghiacconi was dead.

755
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,400
It wouldn't change
what I did.

756
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,600
If I could take
it all back.

757
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,100
It's always your decision,

758
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,600
always your plan:

759
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,100
where I go to school,
what classes I take,

760
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,600
what sports I do.

761
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
When do I get to choose?

762
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,000
You and your mother
are everything to me.

763
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,800
I want us to stay together,
get through this as a family.

764
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,800
But if you still want
to go travel the world,

765
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,600
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

766
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,700
What about Mom?

767
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,200
I'll get her on board.

768
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,900
Give me a day or two
to get you some money
and a passport.

769
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,800
That's it?
You're letting me go?

770
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,600
You've paid enough
for your old man's mistakes.

771
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,300
But I decided to stay
with my parents instead.

772
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,700
I never got the chance
to tell my dad my decision.

773
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,000
Spin the globe?

774
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,700
You saying Tammy was there
with you?

775
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,100
She came down to the shore.

776
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,400
Telling her I couldn't go away
with her...

777
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,000
it was the hardest thing
I'd ever done.

778
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,800
You two were gonna leave
that night?

779
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,100
She was already packed.

780
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,600
Even wrote a letter

781
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,400
to her dad to say
good-bye.

782
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,500
Why didn't you tell us

783
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,200
you were down the shore

784
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,400
the night of the cross-country
meet, Tammy?

785
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I was afraid my father would
find out I was gonna run away.

786
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
He'd kill me.

787
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,500
Where'd he think you were
that night?

788
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,500
At the library studying.

789
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,300
After Jeff said he couldn't go
away with me,

790
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,700
I checked my phone.

791
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,600
He'd already called, like,
nine times looking for me.

792
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,700
What'd you tell him?

793
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,000
That I'd be home soon.

794
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,600
Then I drove like a maniac
back to Camden.

795
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
He there when you got home?

796
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,700
No, thank God. I just tore up

797
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,800
the letter I wrote him,
flushed it down the toilet.

798
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
He never knew I was gonna leave.

799
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,100
Please don't tell him, okay?

800
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,500
Ben'car turned up
at a salvage yard in Whitman.

801
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,600
CSU found blood in the trunk.

802
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,300
Parker wanted in
on the interview.

803
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,200
Said Ben was his witness.

804
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Little late for the
professionalism there, Tom.

805
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,300
I'm not giving this one up
to the feds.

806
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,600
Told him thanks, but I thought
he'd done quite enough already.

807
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,400
The feds said if you testified
against Ghiacconi,

808
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,300
they'd keep you safe,
out of prison.

809
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,000
Didn't tell you what
it would cost you,
though, did they?

810
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,800
Lost your wife,
your friends.

811
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,300
<i>Not the big spacone
anymore, huh?</i>

812
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,000
Just another schmuck
in a minivan.

813
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,400
You're all alone
except for Tammy.

814
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,400
You'd do anything
to keep her under your roof,

815
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,600
wouldn't you, Vinnie?

816
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,100
Where I'm from, girls live
at home until they're married.

817
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,500
Tradition.

818
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,400
But Tammy's a modern girl.

819
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,000
You know,
curious about the world.

820
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,300
Not the kind

821
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,000
to stick around
forever.

822
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,800
Says you.

823
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,900
Well, you found the letter
she wrote you.

824
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,500
Said she was leaving,

825
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
going off to sail the world

826
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,600
with Jeff Feldman.
Don't know
what you're talking about.

827
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,800
<i>No more chicken piccata and
High School Musical for you.</i>

828
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,700
Just you and a frozen pizza,

829
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,900
staring at the wall
like a caged rat.

830
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,100
Detective, you got
some imagination.

831
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
And no way you were gonna
let her abandon you like that.

832
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,800
So you went down the shore
looking for her.

833
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,000
But you found Ben first,
didn't you?

834
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,300
Last time I saw Ben
was at the meet,

835
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,800
just like I told you.

836
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,500
You thought you'd
take one of the major
bridges into Philly.

837
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,900
But if I had a body in my trunk,

838
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,400
I'd take
the Tacony-Palmyra, too.

839
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,500
I got you driving

840
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,700
a dead man's car.

841
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,700
Phone records proving you called
Tammy from Cape May that night.

842
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,200
Got your minivan ticketed
for overtime parking

843
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
on Main Street
in Cape May.

844
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,000
See, it's over, Vinnie.

845
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Talk second chances till you're blue in the face.

846
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,200
Tigers don't change
their stripes.

847
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,500
I need protective custody.

848
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,300
And I wanna see myaughter.

849
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,000
Need it in writing.

850
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,200
Where you gonna put me?

851
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,500
Find a nice pen close to Tammy.

852
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,900
Be difficult, and you're going
to Rhode Island...

853
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,400
see just how vindictive
Ghiacconi's

854
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,700
crew can be.

855
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
I am a family man.

856
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,600
Tammy was all that I had left.

857
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,000
Everything I did
was for my daughter.

858
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,200
Where's Tammy?

859
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,800
What are you doing here, Vinnie?

860
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,200
I'm looking for my daughter.

861
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,600
Why would she be here?

862
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,300
She left
a letter saying

863
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,000
she's going away with Jeff.

864
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,100
Ah, she's the girl he was trying
to impress at the meet.

865
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,100
I found directions
to the Cape May Motel

866
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,500
on her computer.
Now where is she?

867
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,100
I haven't seen her.
I left Jeff a couple hours ago.

868
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,900
I gotta find her.

869
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,700
Where, where's Jeff?!

870
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,200
Vinnie, calm down.
You're gonna give yourself

871
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,400
a heart attack.

872
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
I'm asking you
a question.

873
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,800
Where's your son?

874
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,300
I'm not gonna tell you that,
Vinnie.

875
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
What?

876
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,300
I'm letting him go.

877
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,300
T9is is no life for a kid.

878
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,500
If he wants to travel the world,
I'm gonna let him.

879
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,000
You might wanna do the same.

880
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,600
So that's it?

881
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,400
"See ya later. Bye?"

882
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,900
Our kids have suffered enough
for our mistakes.

883
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,100
You're some kind of father.

884
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,800
Well, I'm doing the best I can.

885
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,100
Where's Jeff?

886
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,800
Son of a bit!h!

887
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,500
Honey?

888
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,500
Hey, Daddy,
I just saw you called.

889
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
Where are you? I've been looking
everywhere for you.

890
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,900
I was just studying
with some friends.

891
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,400
I'll be home soon, okay?

892
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:38,500
* The battle's been lost,
the war is not won *

893
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,700
* An addled republic,
a bitter refund *

894
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,300
* The business-first
flat-earthers *

895
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,800
* Licking their wounds *

896
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,500
* The verdict is dire,
the country's in ruins *

897
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,000
* Providence blinked
facing the sun *

898
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,200
* Where are we left
to carry on? *

899
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,900
* Until the day is done *

900
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,300
* Until the day is done *

901
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,500
* So we've written our stories
to entertain *

902
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
* These notions of glory
and bull-market gain *

903
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,400
* The Teleprompt flutters,
the power surge brings *

904
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,100
* An easy speed message
fas into routine *

905
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,700
* Providence blinked
facing the sun *

906
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,600
* Where are we left
to carry on? *

907
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,500
* Until the day is done *

908
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,400
* Until the day is done. *
