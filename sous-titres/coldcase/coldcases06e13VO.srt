<i>"Simply irresistible"
by Robert Palmer.</i>

00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,610
September 2,1988

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,500
60 seconds to air !

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,890
Where's America's sweetheart ?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Everett.

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,140
Where's Everett ?
Has anyone seen Everett ?

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,730
Keep your pants on, Kravet.
I'm right here.

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,850
60 seconds till we go live.

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,960
Well, you think I wake up
looking like this ?

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,170
It takes time.

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,410
They want ratings,
I'm giving 'em ratings.

13
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,310
You still eating
those damn Tums ?

14
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,200
Only thing keeping me alive.

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,780
Okay, Jane, you've got the S&L thing
and the rerun thing.

16
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,440
Little to your left, Jane.

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,670
- How's this, Clay ?
- Camera loves you.

18
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,320
Have you talked to them yet ?

19
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,570
Come on, Nathan.

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,330
Barbara Wa-Wa isn't the only one
who can make celebrities cry.

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,580
Get me a special.

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,890
You won't remember my name

23
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:53,191
when you sign that big contract
with network, will you ?

24
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,150
The adorable man who rescued me
from tiny-town action news?

25
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,940
- You kidding ?
- 2 ...

26
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,290
- I'll talk to them.
- 1...

27
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,790
A fire in a West Philadelphia
row house claims six lives.

28
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,400
The Channel 7 News Team
is on the ground

29
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:07,201
with that story in just a moment.

30
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,020
And later we'll bring you the...

31
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,820
What ?

32
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,340
- We lost the teleprompter.
- Where is it ?

33
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,770
Um, the update on the...

34
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,780
Cut to commercial ?

35
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,150
Give her a second.

36
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,520
The story on the Bass Group's...

37
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,910
$2 billion purchase of the
Savings and Loan Association.

38
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:30,311
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

39
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,460
No, hang on...

40
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:33,261
But first,
what you've been waiting for.

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,910
After months of reruns due to
the writer's strike,Falcon Crest,

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,010
Murder She Wrote,and all
your favorites are back.

43
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,590
The update after these messages.

44
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,690
All clear.

45
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,710
You get 'em, Jane.

46
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,870
- Okay.
- This ain't casual Friday.

47
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,160
What, are you trying out
for the team mascot, Nick ?

48
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,540
Game's tonight.

49
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,010
You in, Scotty ? Hitting Jones.

50
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,120
I don't do hockey.

51
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,250
I want to see a fight,
I go to the ring.

52
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,080
This one's something.

53
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,860
Anyone remember a newscaster

54
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:37,361
named Jane Everett,
co-anchor at Channel 7 ?

55
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,500
Jane Everett.She was hot.

56
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,930
Yeah, strangled in Fairmount Park
back in the '80s.

57
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,390
A research assistant from Channel 7
is on her way up to show us something.

58
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,950
Was that a tooth ?

59
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,750
Gloves are off, baby.

60
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,430
Tory Roberts ?

61
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,840
Channel 7.

62
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,220
I'm Detective Rush.

63
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,510
Why don't you come with me ?

64
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,500
Oh... I got it.

65
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,220
Make sure you get all her info,
you know : name, number...

66
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,990
marital status.

67
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,330
Said you had something
to show us ?

68
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,160
An old Beta tape.

69
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,300
We're converting
outdated formats to DVD.

70
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,730
I got stuck logging all the footage.

71
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,410
You'd give WCNU reporters
a run for their money,

72
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:26,311
they put you on the air.

73
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,350
- Going to make that jump one day.
- Yeah?

74
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,650
So what do you got ?

75
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,540
<i>This is Jane Everett of WCNU.</i>

76
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,000
<i>Tonight I'll be bringing you
a special report.</i>

77
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,680
<i>Jane Everett.</i>

78
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,540
<i>What ?</i>

79
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,800
<i>Slow down.</i>

80
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,720
<i>Are you threatening me ?</i>

81
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,460
<i>Listen, just...</i>

82
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,710
<i>you did the right thing.</i>

83
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,370
<i>Just don't make
any decisions tonight.</i>

84
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,610
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

85
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,680
<i>I'll be there in 20 minutes.</i>

86
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,750
Tape's got a time stamp.

87
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,520
November 2, 1988.

88
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:05,721
Everyone said her murder
was this random thing,

89
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,180
but they found the body
six hours after that call.

90
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,620
11:46 p.m.

91
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,030
Means Jane met her
caller around midnight.

92
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,700
So the caller's either
the last to see...

93
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,170
Or Jane's talking to her killer.

94

<font color=9015e7>COLD CASE
Season 6 Episode 13</font>

97
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,520
"Local cross-country team finds newscaster
Jane Everett strangled in Fairmount Park."

98
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,080
No shortage of coverage
or man-hours on this one.

99
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,660
Story was all over the place.

100
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,890
People felt like they knew her.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,060
Well, she was in their living rooms
every night.

102
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,970
Pretty girl.

103
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,710
Looked great in a leotard.

104
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,730
Did you see that special
she did on aerobics ?

105
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,360
You into aerobics, Nick ?

106
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,830
What's it to you ?

107
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,990
Don't let me catch you
in a leotard.

108
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,400
Jane grew up in Manayunk.

109
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,640
Tough neighborhood.

110
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,340
Father was a tollbooth operator,
died in '82 ;

111
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:23,741
mom was a housewife.

112
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,910
Margie Everett.

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,890
Valens and Miller are
talking to her now.

114
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,140
Only 27 years old.

115
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,590
- Strangled with her own scarf.
- Crime of passion.

116
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,160
No mention of a boyfriend.

117
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,000
Original theory was some
perv saw an easy target.

118
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,430
No DNA or witnesses
to discount the theory.

119
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,070
Abrasions, torn clothes.

120
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,970
She didn't go without a fight.

121
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,720
Lived a few blocks from the park.

122
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,821
Jogged there every morning
at 5:00 a.m. before work.

123
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,040
5:00 a.m... hours
are worse than ours.

124
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,820
She died in the same clothes
she was wearing in that video:

125
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:54,521
turtleneck, windbreaker.

126
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,720
Time of death was estimated
between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m.

127
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,550
Maybe she didn't go to
the park for her run.

128
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,920
Could have met the caller there.

129
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,090
Or the caller knew she'd be there.
Tracked her down.

130
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,480
See what you can get
from WCNU phone records.

131
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,730
If Jane knew her attacker,

132
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,231
it's about time we did, too.

133
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,050
My daughter was a natural.

134
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,390
One look at her,
people just fell in love.

135
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,790
Anything you can tell us about
her personal life, Mrs.Everett ?

136
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,630
Yeah, she didn't have one.

137
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,800
She spent years at stations out west.

138
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,570
Then she gets a job
here in Philly,

139
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:27,171
I still didn't get to see her.

140
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,650
Attractive woman like Jane
must have had a boyfriend.

141
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,690
Well, if she did,
she didn't tell me about it.

142
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,380
Two of you...

143
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,700
have a falling out?

144
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,180
I left college in the middle
of my junior year to have her.

145
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,620
I got my education
from the school of

146
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:43,821
Edward R.Murrow
and Walter Cronkite.

147
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,540
Janey and I, uh...

148
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,630
we bonded over the news
when she was a little girl.

149
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,060
She'd even give her own
broadcasts at dinner.

150
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,740
But by the time she died,
the news wasn't the news anymore.

151
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,700
It was nothing but fluff,and
she didn't seem to care.

152
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,340
Aerobics and...
celebrity love lives.

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,900
That what your spat was over ?
Type of stories she was covering ?

154
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,700
She was co-anchoring the fourth
largest market in this country.

155
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,850
It still wasn't enough for me.

156
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,520
<i>Hundreds of families...</i>

157
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:16,021
Janey, you're on.

158
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,570
<i>...are taking part in
this great event.</i>

159
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,300
Oh, what are you wearing ?

160
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,250
Um, it's a Halloween costume.

161
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,470
<i>I got to say I think the adults
are having as much fun as the kids.</i>

162
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,960
It's better than the sexy witch.

163
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:30,061
<i>And best of all,
the proceeds go to charity.</i>

164
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,180
Shaw Plastics raised $50,000
for disadvantaged kids.

165
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,140
It was a good cause.

166
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,850
More like a good advertisement.

167
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,990
Did Shaw Plastics pay you
to cover that story ?

168
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,820
We do this kind of stuff
all the time, Ma.

169
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,120
You give companies positive press,
they buy ads.

170
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,070
Well, the Jane I knew dreamed of
covering the presidential debates.

171
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,940
Mort is covering the presidential
debates. You know that.

172
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,090
Can't you cover them, too ?

173
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,040
Why do you always get
stuck with the fluff ?

174
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,750
There's got to be something else.

175
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,340
Like what ? The elections in Chile ?

176
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,690
Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan ?

177
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,160
Do you know what it would take
to get people

178
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:06,261
to watch a story about armed rebels
in remote villages ?

179
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,430
Well, you don't really
believe that, do you ?

180
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,090
Management made changes
to improve our ratings.

181
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,540
I took their advice about my hair
and my wardrobe,

182
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,241
and we went up four points.

183
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,760
Four points for teasing your hair ?

184
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,960
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you this, Ma.

185
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,340
It's just...it's the
way the business is now.

186
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,710
I just...I don't understand

187
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:26,611
why news had to stop being news.

188
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,590
Well, ask Nathan
if you don't believe me.

189
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,830
We've made peace with it.
Maybe you should, too.

190
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,310
Janey, I'm not trying
to be critical.

191
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,110
I know. I've got an early morning, Ma.
I'll see you later, okay ?

192
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,830
Well...

193
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:41,231
<i>"What's the matter here ?"
by 10 000 Maniacs.</i>

194
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,270
The last time I saw
my daughter alive

195
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:49,471
and I was giving her a hard time.

196
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,620
Who's this Nathan
she was talking about ?

197
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,970
Nathan Kravet.

198
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,560
He was her boss.

199
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,780
Well, he was her mentor, really.

200
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,570
They met when Janey was
at Syracuse University.

201
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,080
Thanks for your time, Mrs.Everett.

202
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,030
What I wouldn't give to see
Janey on TV again,

203
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:09,231
cat suit or not.

204
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,200
Everett was something else.

205
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,290
I gave a guest lecture at
Syracuse her freshman year.

206
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,350
She sent me a story idea
every week

207
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:22,751
till she graduated.

208
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,180
They any good ?

209
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,680
Not bad, actually.

210
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,400
She had an eye for the angle.

211
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,320
Could find a story in any picture.

212
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,940
Where'd the cat suit fit in ?

213
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,820
By the time I hired her at WCNU,
things were changing.

214
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,980
What qualified as news was
anything that got ratings.

215
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,120
Including cute newsgirls ?

216
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,480
Before Reagan took office,

217
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,081
stations had to serve the public,

218
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,882
present balanced reports.

219
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,420
Hell, there were even
limits on the amount of ads.

220
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,820
Reagan relaxed all the rules.

221
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,180
Relaxed is right.

222
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,280
Looks more like a
vacation than reporting.

223
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,660
Company retreats.

224
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,280
Better ratings meant better profits.

225
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,820
Better profits meant
better corporate retreats.

226
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,870
Any idea who might have been
threatening Jane the night she died ?

227
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,760
No idea. It wasn't like
she was breaking Watergate.

228
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,820
Uh,I think her last story
was about mall walkers.

229
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,090
You see her that night ?

230
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,140
I was holed up in my
office on the third floor.

231
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,240
Jane was on the first, so no.

232
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,580
Did she always work till midnight ?

233
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,450
Evening news wrapped at 7:00 ;
doesn't mean we did.

234
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,890
Public persona like that,

235
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:22,091
she ever attract the wrong kind
of attention ?

236
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,020
Far as I knew, everyone loved her.

237
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,080
After a year at WCNU,

238
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:28,681
she was getting more fan mail
than the seasoned reporters.

239
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,750
Any of those seasoned reporters
have a problem with that ?

240
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,500
There's one person
who comes to mind.

241
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,540
The crime has left two people dead
and an entire neighborhood devastated.

242
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,680
It's yet another casualty of the
crack epidemic here in the Philly...

243
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,460
...in, in the city of Ph...

244
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,640
In other news, he's this
year's Sexiest Man Alive.

245
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,970
JFK,Junior.

246
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,000
So who made his list
of sexiest women ?

247
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,570
We'll have the story after this.

248
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,850
<i>All clear.</i>

249
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,600
Last I checked,
I was the lead anchor.

250
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,880
I was trying to help you.

251
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:02,181
You help by letting me finish
the damn story.

252
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,290
It's called a transition.

253
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,191
Or don't they teach that
in journalism school anymore ?

254
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,800
Take it easy, Mort.

255
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,320
She's doing her job.

256
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,720
You're the one who hired this
amateur bubblehead newsreader.

257
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,270
As opposed to a pompous has-been ?

258
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,540
Hey, I was here before you, sweetie ;
I'll be here after.

259
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,660
Ten, nine, eight, ...

260
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:18,461
Have you checked with
management on that ?

261
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,080
You bet against me, sweetheart,
and I'll crush you.

262
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,140
...three, two.

263
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,610
An update on a story from yesterday:

264
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,860
the President has stated that
his position will not change

265
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,210
in spite of what Congress...

266
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:32,311
<i>"One thing leads to another"
par The Fixx.</i>

267
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,890
WCNU went from worst to first
that year

268
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:39,191
and there was only one reason :
Jane Everett.

269
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,580
Mort knew it ?

270
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,500
His low-grade insecurity
became full-blown paranoia.

271
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,010
Called me all hours of the
night trying to get her fired.

272
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,630
Why not get rid of him instead ?

273
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,070
Thought about it.

274
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,900
Till he won a Peabody

275
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:52,401
for his coverage of
Jane's murder.

276
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,180
Bought himself another
20 years in the business.

277
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,350
So I get this Bobby
Badass in the squad car.

278
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,460
Thinks I'm hauling him down
to PPD till he realizes,

279
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:06,061
we're heading in
the wrong direction.

280
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,630
The kid starts freaking out

281
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:09,531
'cause we're going into
29th Street territory.

282
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,700
- The rival gang ?
- Yeah.

283
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,600
He's begging us to turn around,

284
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,801
and I'm talking to my partner
about stopping for doughnuts.

285
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,730
Kid wets his pants,
tells us everything.

286
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,470
That'd make a great segment.

287
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,670
Well, there's more where
that came from.

288
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,550
How are things going ?

289
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,370
Jane Everett case ?

290
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,120
Stick around... and I'll let you know.

291
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,620
Scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours ?

292
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,270
Sounds good to me.

293
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,070
Hey, take that off, would ya ?

294
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,770
- What ?
- Looks like you're about to take flight.

295
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,440
Check out Casanova with
that hottie from Channel 7.

296
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,940
Back in the saddle.

297
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,480
Excuse me.

298
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,870
What up, fellas ?

299
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,110
Rush dug up some dirt
on Mort Ackerson.

300
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,080
Jane lodged a formal complaint against him
with the WCNU Human Resources,

301
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:01,481
October 18, '88.

302
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,360
That's two weeks before she's killed.

303
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,430
It said Mort showed up
at her shoots,

304
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:08,631
was following her to interviews
and press conferences.

305
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,560
All right, Tory says
the guy's a real tool.

306
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,140
Got serious issues
working with the ladies.

307
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,060
Eat it, Zaretsky !

308
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,530
That's gonna be better
than the game.

309
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,200
Well, last I checked,
this was a cop bar.

310
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,810
Is that the best you can do ?

311
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,690
- Newsroom Barbie?
- Oh, damn it, Frankie.

312
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,080
What ? I like hockey.

313
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,410
Your husband like hockey too ?

314
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,700
Admit it.

315
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,170
What ?

316
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,310
You're trying to make me jealous.

317
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,760
You're the one came here.

318
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,830
So, maybe it's working.

319
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,510
You know, you're not the
only woman in the world.

320
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,280
Right now I am.

321
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,240
I should go.

322
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,310
Yeah, you should.

323
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,470
Come on. Let's get out of here.

324
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,760
Mr Ackerson ?
I'm Detective Rush.

325
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,570
I don't normally do this, but you
think I could have your autograph ?

326
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,760
Well, sure.

327
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,070
Call me Mort.

328
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,520
It's for my auntie.

329
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,880
Sign it :

330
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:57,481
"Dear Edie...

331
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:00,582
see you in 50 to life."

332
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,280
You think I hurt Jane Everett ?
Is that what this is all about ?

333
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,990
Convince me otherwise.

334
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,170
I always thought it was
innocent until proven guilty.

335
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,600
Remember what happened to your ratings
after Jane was murdered, Mort ?

336
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,660
I didn't pay attention to ratings.

337
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,990
They went up.

338
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,920
Or maybe it's 'cause of
the Peabody Award I won ?

339
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,500
For covering Jane's murder.

340
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,540
You ever show up at her shoots ?

341
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,390
- No.
- Call her at home ?

342
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,580
No.

343
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,720
Oh, Jane's Human Resources file.

344
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,130
But I guess you already know

345
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:34,731
about the complaint she filed
against you.

346
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,110
So I wasn't her biggest fan.

347
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,420
But that girl didn't know her place.

348
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:44,121
<i>"Red skies" by The Fixx.</i>

349
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,960
That's the Shaw Plastics
fundraiser, isn't it ?

350
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,790
Who's that fighting ?

351
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,090
David Wyatt.

352
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,860
He's their PR guy, isn't he ?

353
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,150
Doesn't make sense.

354
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,160
They take care of their employees.

355
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,810
Tell it to that guy.

356
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,870
<i>Mandatory drug testing ?</i>

357
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,120
<i>Don't you think I know
what that's about ?</i>

358
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,860
<i>My family has given
15 years to this plant.</i>

359
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,150
<i>Would you keep your voice down ?</i>

360
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,180
<i>Hey, look, I just want
some answers, all right ?!</i>

361
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,090
<i>We both know I'm entitled
to ask for a lot more than that.</i>

362
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,820
Something's going on here.

363
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,350
So, what do you think, you're some kind of
breaking news reporter all of a sudden ?

364
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,420
Why don't you go bother that new
intern you've been circling, huh ?

365
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,430
Piece of advice, sweetheart ?

366
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,300
Stick to putting on your lipstick
and smiling pretty for the camera.

367
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,040
And upstage you ?

368
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,500
Never.

369
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,670
She was investigating a story.

370
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,350
I was wondering about that myself.

371
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,590
But if there was a story there,
Jane wasn't getting it.

372
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,580
She reported me to Human
Resources the next morning.

373
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,680
She was just mad 'cause she
didn't have what it took.

374
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,550
I was the one people trusted.

375
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,310
Where was that house located ?

376
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,290
Corner of 4th and... Lehigh.

377
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,140
Where were you
the night Jane died ?

378
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,280
I caught up with that new intern.

379
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,730
Rhonda Stewart.

380
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,970
Gonna need her number.

381
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,600
No problem.

382
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm sure she'll remember.

383
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,970
Boss,got the phone records from WCNU.

384
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,870
Call to Jane's extension
at 11:46 was local.

385
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,090
So there was no way to
trace it back that far.

386
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,730
What about her reporter's notebook ?

387
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,020
Station cleaned out
her office back when.

388
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,210
Mort Ackerson's alibi check out ?

389
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,120
Uh, Rhonda the intern.

390
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,440
Big producer over at WIXA now.

391
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,940
Uh, she vouched for him.

392
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,660
Mort's lucky day.

393
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,650
Canvassed the block of 4th and Lehigh.

394
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,560
Guy who lived in the
corner house moved in '89.

395
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,670
Name's Evan Briggs.

396
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,610
Neighbor said he worked at
Shaw Plastics with his wife.

397
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,360
Left the neighborhood
after she died.

398
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,570
Where is he now ?

399
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,360
Meijers Plastics bought Shaw,
December '88.

400
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,690
Lot of red tape getting
to his personnel file.

401
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,670
See if ADA Bell can
help with the warrant.

402
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,090
Sounds like this Briggs
had real issues with Jane.

403
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,470
I, uh, think you got something
of mine.

404
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,520
Something of yours ?

405
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,550
You sure ?

406
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,350
I'm sure.

407
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,230
Let me, uh, see what I can dig up.

408
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,660
Yeah, you do that.

409
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,470
Detectives, I'm Andrew Powers, CEO.

410
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,780
I was hoping to join
your meeting,

411
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,170
but,uh, I'm sure David can help
you with whatever you need.

412
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,560
I'm David Wyatt.
Public Relations.

413
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,510
I understand you have
some questions

414
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:19,411
concerning a former employee,
Evan Briggs ?

415
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,450
Two of you had some kind
of altercation back in '88?

416
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,960
That was a long time ago.

417
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,390
In fact, it didn't ring any
bells until I pulled the file.

418
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,320
I'd only been with the
company a few months.

419
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,620
What does this have to do
with Jane Everett's murder ?

420
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,240
Can I see that file ?

421
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,020
Yes.

422
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,390
He was terminated for failing
to pass a mandatory drug test.

423
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,330
I don't see any prior infractions,
previous 21 years ?

424
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,970
We didn't start the testing until '88.

425
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,960
He could've been coming to work high
every day. We would never have known.

426
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,590
Meijers bought Shaw Plastics
later on that year, right ?

427
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,060
Drug testing a precursor
to the buyout ?

428
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,250
Did make sense, I mean, you'd want
to get rid of the deadbeats first.

429
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,350
Well, drill it down, and yes,

430
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:06,751
a guy like Evan Briggs was bad
for business.

431
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,390
Shaw Plastics is a family corporation.

432
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,890
No room for drug use.

433
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,510
Family corporation ?
It's a funny way of putting it.

434
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,180
Sometimes we had to
use a little tough love.

435
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,090
Jane Everett ever contact you

436
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,391
about this "tough love" program ?

437
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,850
Uh,no.

438
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,070
Well, she ever talk to you
about Briggs ?

439
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,340
Ms. Everett covered a
few fundraisers for us.

440
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,110
That's all.

441
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,410
Now, if you will excuse me,

442
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:36,011
I do have some business
I need to attend to.

443
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,490
Thanks for your time.

444
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,770
Oh, we're holding on to this.

445
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,700
Drill it down.

446
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,350
Guy's a schmuck.

447
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,800
Hey, I gotta swing by Channel 7.

448
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,601
See if they got more
Jane Everett tapes.

449
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,740
You wanna come with ?
Hit Geno's after ?

450
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,320
Oh, you mean 'cause you don't
wanna go to Channel 7 alone

451
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,260
after you ditched that
girl at the bar last night ?

452
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,690
What are you talking about ?

453
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,580
Leave me out of it.

454
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,240
Nope !

455
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,130
Look who's back.

456
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,680
Yeah, Tory, listen...

457
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,490
On-the-line guys needed help
with a bust over in Fishtown.

458
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,800
I wanted to tell you, but this kind
of thing goes down quick and...

459
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,230
Your on-the-line guys
always wear pencil skirts ?

460
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:41,730
Yeah, right, actually, that girl, she's
an associate of the undercover unit.

461
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,190
Hmm,you know what?Next time
something "goes down'...

462
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,930
I get a call for the exclusive.

463
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,450
Deal.

464
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,660
So, where do you want to start ?

465
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,400
Are these the tapes ?

466
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,960
Every tape Jane ever made.

467
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,840
So, you were Jane's cameraman ?

468
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,830
I knew Jane better than anyone.

469
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,070
Best angle, best lights.

470
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,360
Sounds intimate.

471
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,680
Nature of the job.

472
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,650
You two ever get involved ?

473
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,390
Wouldn't have minded.

474
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,190
But she was busy climbing
the ladder.

475
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,070
She ever mention a story involving
a plastics factory, Shaw Plastics ?

476
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,300
We covered a fundraiser
for them once.

477
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,800
Jane saw something.

478
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,630
She had me film
a couple of guys arguing

479
00:22:26,631 --> 00:22:28,631
while she pretended
to talk to fans.

480
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,890
Was this man one of them ?

481
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,520
Yeah, he was arguing with a guy.

482
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,460
Looked like his boss, maybe.

483
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,780
Ever see him giving Jane
any trouble ?

484
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,870
Yeah.

485
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,110
A couple of nights later, we were
shooting B-roll at an aerobics class.

486
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,540
She wanted to go by his house.

487
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,020
But he definitely
wasn't expecting us.

488
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,550
Mr. Briggs ? Are you home ?

489
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:58,551
<i>"Don't come around here anymore"
by Tom Petty.</i>

490
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,230
What the hell are you
doing back here again ?

491
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,920
Mr. Briggs, the door was open ;
I thought you heard us.

492
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,860
I already told you,
I got nothing to say.

493
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,190
Now that drug test was a lie.

494
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,160
Now, get before I call the cops !

495
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,490
Please, I just want to talk to you,
help figure things out.

496
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,230
Maybe that is what the test picked up.

497
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,280
Percocet ?

498
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,050
- You get out of here with that thing !
- Easy, buddy !

499
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,760
Wait outside, Clay. I have done some
research, and I think I can help you.

500
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,530
Look, I ain't going to ask you again.

501
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,490
Now, get out.

502
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,080
I don't know what that story was about,
but whatever it was pissed that guy off.

503
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,590
You didn't think that might've had
something to do with Jane's murder ?

504
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,280
Hotheads like him made good TV.

505
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,800
Way reporters earned their stripes.

506
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,960
What's the hell all this ?

507
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,890
Evan Briggs ?
Philadelphia Homicide.

508
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,350
Like to ask you a few questions.

509
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,290
What kind of questions ?

510
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,320
Kind about Jane Everett.

511
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,730
Got nothing to say.

512
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,510
You want to talk to us for an hour
or talk to a grand jury for six ?

513
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,460
Your choice.

514
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,010
Briggs ? Briggs ?

515
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:43,811
Run !

516
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,690
Hey, don't hurt him, you hear ?!

517
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,150
Control the dog or the
next one has his name on it.

518
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,820
Saw your brand of hospitality, Briggs.

519
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,680
Jane Everett come at you too
many times, get the same treatment ?

520
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,940
I didn't hurt that reporter.

521
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,490
You were in a hell of
a situation back in '88.

522
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,440
Lost your job, your wife...

523
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,990
Life was in a tailspin.

524
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,710
Jane found out you got terminated,

525
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:21,511
threatened to make your life even worse
by exposing your drug use.

526
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,580
Couldn't get worse.

527
00:25:23,581 --> 00:25:25,581
Not when they took
my health insurance.

528
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,170
Not when they took my house.

529
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,520
Had to sting.

530
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,950
Jane throwing you under a
bus just to break a story.

531
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,340
Don't you get it ?

532
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,580
Story wasn't about me.
It was about my wife.

533
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,760
We worked at the factory
together till she got cancer.

534
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,850
Jane knew who was to
blame for her getting sick.

535
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,290
Mr. Briggs.

536
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,820
You scared me.

537
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,690
She's gone. My wife.

538
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,260
Doctors said it was coming,
but...

539
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,130
You don't want to believe.

540
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,700
I'm sorry.

541
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,720
Uh, what you were talking about ?

542
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,420
I'm listening.

543
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,340
I spoke to the pharmacist you go to about
the Percocet you're taking for your cough.

544
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,510
She said you're not the only one
from the factory taking it.

545
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,230
- So ?
- I met with a doctor.

546
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,710
Told him the tubing that Shaw manufactures
is reinforced with asbestos.

547
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,490
He said the tests are just being confirmed,
but a lot of people are saying

548
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:56,491
that asbestos is bad.

549
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,310
Said it's probably what caused
your wife's cancer.

550
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,610
They knew ?

551
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,740
There are others.

552
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,620
Doctor gave Peggy Foster
four months this morning.

553
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,940
She's even younger than my wife.

554
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,020
Cliff Schuster. Len Turner...

555
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,410
All right.

556
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,190
What do you want to do ?

557
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,890
I want to take them on.

558
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,790
Take on Shaw Plastics ? Yeah.

559
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,750
Anyone opens their mouth, company
will cut 'em off at the ankles.

560
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,320
They'll take their health insurance.
That's all those people got.

561
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,040
You do nothing, the company
gets away with murder.

562
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:48,580
Hey,my word ain't going to
mean squat against those suits.

563
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,180
That's why I found
someone to back us up.

564
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,680
- An insider.
- Someone from Shaw ?

565
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,330
He agreed to go on camera,

566
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:59,231
admit that Shaw knew their employees were
being exposed to asbestos and covered it up.

567
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,500
- I'm going to film him tonight.
- Then what ?

568
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,660
Then I bring it to my boss and
we break the story tomorrow.

569
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,600
Prime time.

570
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,380
Wait, your boss knows about this ?

571
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,220
Gonna tell him tonight.
He will stand by us.

572
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,600
- Ms.Everett, uh...
- Jane.

573
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,260
These, uh, men...

574
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,240
they play dirty, and they
ain't gonna stop at me.

575
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,360
So why are you doing this ?

576
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:33,350
What kind of a reporter
would I be if I didn't ?

577
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,430
She ever tell you who
this insider was ?

578
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,260
No idea.

579
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,120
Guys in management were cronies.

580
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,710
Can't imagine any one of
them sticking a neck out.

581
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,050
Morning Jane died,
where were you ?

582
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,330
Cleaning toilets in Center City.

583
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,610
Worked the midnight shift
at the Atco Building

584
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,711
after the factory canned me.

585
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,160
At least until I got sick.

586
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,830
You, too ?

587
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,850
Been in remission twice.

588
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,560
Don't think there'll be a third.

589
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,010
When my wife got diagnosed,

590
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:24,911
would've given anything to be
the one going through it.

591
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,820
Guess my prayers
have been answered.

592
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,200
"You did the right thing.
Don't make any decisions tonight."

593
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,120
Got to be this insider
who called her that night.

594
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,230
Well,Jane wanted to broadcast
the interview the next day.

595
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,390
Guy was trying to undo
what he'd already done.

596
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,840
So if Jane recorded the interview,
where's the tape ?

597
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,100
Well, it definitely ain't at WCNU.

598
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,010
I screened every tape
Jane ever touched.

599
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,740
Could've brought it home
with her.

600
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,550
That's what I would've done.

601
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,800
Who packed up Jane's house ?

602
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,160
Here are the rest of them.

603
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,870
Been in there for years.

604
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,770
Just couldn't bring myself
to throw anything away.

605
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,820
Did Jane ever tell you about the
last story she was working on ?

606
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,160
Was something about people

607
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:21,461
walking in malls for exercise,
wasn't it ?

608
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,310
Lil, I got something.

609
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,710
November 2, 1988.

610
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,590
A day before she died.

611
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,100
<i>People deserve to know the truth
about what's happening to them.</i>

612
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,540
<i>Why it's happening.
People are dying.</i>

613
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,140
<i>The people you're referring to
are employees of Shaw Plastics ?</i>

614
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,610
<i>Factory workers.</i>

615
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,080
<i>They're being exposed to a
dangerous toxin called asbestos.</i>

616
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,620
<i>How do you know this ?</i>

617
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,960
<i>Because I have the memo.</i>

618
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,940
<i>Shaw Plastics was aware
of the effects of asbestos.</i>

619
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,690
<i>Can you explain
what that means exactly ?</i>

620
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,710
<i>Well, if you drill it down,</i>

621
00:30:59,211 --> 00:31:02,511
<i>it means the company knew
asbestos was causing cancer.</i>

622
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,760
<i>And instead of doing anything about it,
they covered it up.</i>

623
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,950
<i>... means exactly ?</i>

624
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,900
<i>Well, if you drill it down,
it means the company knew...</i>

625
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,840
There's our smoking gun.

626
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,760
That spin doctor, Wyatt.

627
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,400
Bad PR from a big, fat liar.

628
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,240
Like to see him spin this.

629
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,030
What'd you talk about,
last time you saw Jane ?

630
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,570
A few fundraisers.

631
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,270
I told you, I barely knew her.

632
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,890
That what you called
her about at 11:46 p.m.

633
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,390
night before she was killed ?
"Fundraiser" ?

634
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,840
Shaw Plastics was
knowingly harming people.

635
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:51,170
Company falsified the results of
mandatory drug tests

636
00:31:51,171 --> 00:31:53,571
to flush out anyone
who opened their mouth.

637
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,850
And you knew about it.

638
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,570
The thing is, 21 years later,
you're still working there.

639
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,700
- What's that make you?
- This is ridiculous.

640
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,470
You people don't know
what you're talking about.

641
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,160
<i>... explain what that means exactly ?</i>

642
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,460
Well, if you drill it down,it means the
company knew asbestos was causing cancer.

643
00:32:13,461 --> 00:32:16,761
<i>it means the company knew
asbestos was causing cancer.</i>

644
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:23,210
<i>And instead of doing anything
about it, they covered it up.</i>

645
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,910
Gonna ask again.

646
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,120
What were you calling about
night before she died ?

647
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,870
I didn't kill her.

648
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,520
"You did the right thing.
Don't make any decisions tonight."

649
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,280
Got your conversation on tape.

650
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,850
You drill it down, she was
trying to warm your cold feet.

651
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,010
Interview never aired.

652
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:50,911
You changed your mind and
got rid of her to cover it up.

653
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,530
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

654
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,580
She was going to meet you ;
makes you the last to see her alive.

655
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,520
I was trying to help those
people who were getting sick.

656
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,340
I tried. I really did.

657
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,050
And then I thought about
what the company would do.

658
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,810
Intimidation, blacklists...

659
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,460
- People's lives get ruined.
- Lives did get ruined.

660
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,470
It takes courage
being a whistle-blower.

661
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,620
Heavy lifting for a schmuck like you.

662
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,710
Family corporation and all.

663
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,090
I thought I could talk her out of it.

664
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,570
I shouldn't have talked to you.

665
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,700
I want you to destroy the tape.

666
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,510
I gave Briggs my word,David.

667
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,710
Look, what the company
is doing is wrong.

668
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,930
- That-that's not the issue.
- So what is ?

669
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,540
What are they going to do
to us when they find out ?

670
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,790
Once the story's out,
Shaw can't touch us.

671
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,830
Everyone will know the truth.
Don't back out on us, David.

672
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,650
Every minute we sit here
someone else gets sick.

673
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,300
Tell me you're with me.

674
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,750
All right.

675
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,190
For every one of those people...

676
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,180
thank you.

677
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,110
I called Powers.

678
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,590
Bastard was sailing
in the Cayman Islands.

679
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,170
You told him about Jane ?

680
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,320
The interview you gave her ?

681
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,570
I thought he'd fire me.

682
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,230
Instead I got promoted.

683
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,640
Keeping his enemies closer.

684
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:49,170
You keep your 401k and Jane
ends up dead. You sleep at night ?

685
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:54,850
I asked him to fix the problem so
that more people would not get sick.

686
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,670
What'd he say he was
going to do about it ?

687
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,630
He said all he had to do was call the
station and the story would disappear.

688
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,900
No wonder he didn't stick
around last time we met.

689
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,440
Andrew Powers ?

690
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,950
Remember that asbestos scandal
you covered up back in '88?

691
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,380
Looks like it's making a comeback.

692
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,010
Got stock in the company,

693
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:24,011
might want to call your broker.
Insider information tip.

00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,730
- Andrew ?
- I'll meet you at the restaurant.

695
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,960
What do you want ?

696
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,060
We're thinking you're a conspirator
to the murder of Jane Everett.

697
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,460
Murder ?

698
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,860
I didn't touch that girl.
I was in the Cayman Islands.

699
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,020
We know.

700
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,030
You called someone at WCNU
from your house

701
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:44,031
a few hours before
Jane showed up dead.

702
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,860
Got the phone records
to prove it.

703
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,740
You tell us who you called,
maybe the conspiracy goes away.

704
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,870
I only wanted to kill a story.

705
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,470
Never intended for anyone to get hurt.

706
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,690
We'll let the jury decide that.

707
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,530
All we want is a name.

708
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,270
You friends with
Andrew Powers, Nathan ?

709
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,320
Station covered a few
Shaw fundraisers,

710
00:36:11,321 --> 00:36:13,421
but, uh, no, I didn't know him
personally.

711
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,670
Think of any reason why he might've
been calling your extension at WCNU

712
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,070
from his house
in the Cayman Islands ?

713
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,000
Corporate bigwigs liked
throwing their weight around,

714
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,990
bitching about a story,
so sometimes they'd call.

715
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,850
This particular conversation
happened at 1:15 in the morning,

716
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,410
few hours before Jane was killed.

717
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,380
Probably had some idea he
wanted the station to cover.

718
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,840
Looked into your financials,Nathan.

719
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:45,570
Yeah ?

720
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,371
You bought stock
in Shaw Plastics

721
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,680
two weeks before Meijers
bought the company.

722
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,960
Stroke of genius made you
a millionaire overnight.

723
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,720
What can I say ?
I had a good broker.

724
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,750
It was the '80s. Guys like Powers
were making millions

725
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:00,551
and you wanted a piece
of the pie.

726
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,400
Nothing wrong with free enterprise.

727
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,050
Except there was
nothing "free" about it.

728
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,870
The stock tip came
with strings attached.

729
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:10,280
Powers was calling you that night
because he wanted a story to go away.

730
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,140
And he was right.

731
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,370
Jane had no business
taking that interview.

732
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,310
No, David Wyatt was
no scientist.

733
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:22,610
I mean, you had taught her better than
that, letting her heart lead a story.

734
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,180
It's called journalistic integrity.

735
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,360
You don't just take the
word of some PR hack.

736
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,760
How'd you know about
that interview ?

737
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,540
What ?

738
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,560
The one Jane had with
David Wyatt, that "PR hack" ?

739
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,520
Did Powers tell you about it ?

740
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,160
Or... was it Jane ?

741
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,070
I would never hurt Jane.

742
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,750
She was almost like a daughter to you.

743
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,520
She was.

744
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:56,321
Sending you those stories
every week.

745
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,830
Coming to work for me.

746
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,570
But she was still
holding onto something.

747
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,390
What, what was that you called it ?

748
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,440
- Journalistic...
- Integrity.

749
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,270
Wasn't as simple for you.

750
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,490
You had suits to answer to.

751
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,780
Ratings to get.

752
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,670
Hard not getting swept up in
the bonuses, the kickbacks...

753
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,760
The business demanded it.
It was sink or swim.

754
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,490
You just wanted that tape.

755
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,240
- Simple request.
- That's all I wanted.

756
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,030
But Jane refused.

757
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,090
She knew that if she gave it to me...

758
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,260
we'd both be lost.

759
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,650
Nathan ? What are you doing here ?

760
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,010
I've been...I've been trying
to reach you all night.

761
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,270
I thought it was time to
take care of this.

762
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,000
So what'd you want to talk
to me about ?

763
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,610
I know I asked for
a celebrity special,

764
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:56,470
but... I have a story.

765
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:00,130
I have a real story. The kind that
we used to talk about at Syracuse.

766
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,570
Tell me.

767
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,870
Employees at Shaw
Plastics are getting sick.

768
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,580
I found an executive who admitted

769
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:09,181
management knew they were being
exposed to asbestos,

770
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,600
a toxin that causes cancer.

771
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,520
I got him on tape reading
the memo.

772
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,270
Jane Everett, you cracked a story.

773
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,700
We break the story.

774
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,750
I mean, employees get a chance
at getting their compensation.

775
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,520
They get... they get
their medical bills paid.

776
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:28,910
Right. So, uh, where is it ?

777
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,770
- Where's what ?
- The tape.

778
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,670
- It's in a safe place.
- Great.

779
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,670
I'll need to vet it with,
uh, legal first.

780
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,760
Legal ?

781
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,670
No, these people don't have
that kind of time, Nathan.

782
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,730
We're exposed on this.
Shaw could take us to the cleaners.

783
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,240
We need to be responsible to our
advertisers and to corporate sponsors.

784
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,840
Then I'll take it to another station.

785
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,610
Are you kidding me ?
We'll lose our jobs.

786
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,790
Be sued for slander.
This isn't college, Jane.

787
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,170
This is business.

788
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,960
Now what's it going to
take for you to see that?

789
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,350
One million.

790
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,550
I always knew you were smart, Everett.

791
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,700
A million it is.

792
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,460
Wait. Hey. Where you going ?

793
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,500
You were the one who
lectured me about ethics !

794
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,360
Come on, Jane. News isn't news anymore.

795
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,020
You love it just as much as anybody.

796
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,280
- The ratings, the attention.
- No. Not anymore !

797
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,880
- Come here !
- Just stay away from me !

798
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,660
- Get over here !
- Stay away from me !

799
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,480
Give me the damn tape!

800
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,190
No !

801
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,780
Stop !

802
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:23,481
<i>"Shout" by Tears for fears.</i>
