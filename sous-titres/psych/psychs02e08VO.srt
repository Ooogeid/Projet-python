1
00:00:00,803 --> 00:00:02,657
So then this, um, guy

2
00:00:02,695 --> 00:00:05,390
with pliers comes in,
probably with safety goggles,

3
00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:07,549
maybe some sort
of fire retardant cover all.

4
00:00:07,596 --> 00:00:11,239
He starts doing his thing,
twisting and turning.

5
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:14,075
There's all sorts of fluids
just spraying all over the place.

6
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:16,770
Then this hydraulic lift
comes into play,

7
00:00:16,826 --> 00:00:19,568
wheeling everything
out of there. There you have it.

8
00:00:19,662 --> 00:00:21,850
- All right? Let's clean up.
- Wait.

9
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:23,590
That's how babies are born?

10
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:27,237
- Yes?
- With a hydraulic lift?

11
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:31,400
- More or less.
- But how are they made?

12
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,019
Uh, Shawn, more important question,
how many hats are in the room?

13
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:36,869
None. How are they made?

14
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:39,010
Hats? Nowadays, I hear
most of them are made in China.

15
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:40,602
- Let's go.
- Forget it.

16
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:42,779
- Maybe I'll go ask mom.
- D... don't, no! No.

17
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:45,781
Wait, wait, come back here. Come
back here, come back here. All right.

18
00:00:51,044 --> 00:00:52,753
Tuck in your shirt
before you talk to her.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,636
All right, tell me exactly
what she said.

20
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,937
- Use her words.
- She said, "hello.

21
00:00:57,965 --> 00:00:59,871
This is chief Vick."
it's a good start, Gus.

22
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:01,000
I love it when she says that.

23
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:04,048
"I have something big to talk
to you about. It's top secret."

24
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,939
Come down to the station
as soon as you can."

25
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:07,225
Do you realize what this means?

26
00:01:07,244 --> 00:01:09,249
It means we're taking it
to the next level.

27
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:12,090
She said "big" and "top secret."
that's two of our favorite '80s movies.

28
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:14,527
I read about the international
yacht bandit.

29
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:15,916
I bet you we're going
undercover on a yacht.

30
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:17,183
Gus, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

31
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,765
She may want us to catch that guy
who's been stalking lingerie models.

32
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:22,728
I know what it is. Last night on the
news, I saw something about a blimp.

33
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:25,952
- "Blimp rides".
-  Shotgun.

34
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,257
You can't call shotgun on a blimp.

35
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:30,114
You can call shotgun anywhere
except a crowded movie theater.

36
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,785
All right, close the blinds, shut the
door, and remain completely silent.

37
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:36,335
This is big.

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,291
Look, I'm trusting you both
to be professional

39
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:45,932
and to keep this matter
completely confidential.

40
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,431
- You got it.
- If you knew how many secrets

41
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,004
I was keeping from you already,
you'd totally trust me.

42
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,864
- It involves a nanny.
- Nanny serial killer.

43
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:54,431
- Nanny on the run?
- Nanny arsonist?

44
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,412
Does she fly a blimp, by chance?

45
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:59,369
No. I need you to hire me
a nanny.

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,236

53
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:27,700
Our big case is finding you
a nanny for your baby?

54
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:30,476
Well, I'd be hiring you
privately, of course.

55
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:33,648
But I cannot stress
how important this is.

56
00:02:33,704 --> 00:02:36,943
Of course. Our children
are our most precious resources.

57
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:37,956
Yes.

58
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:41,824
That. Also, I haven't slept in weeks.

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,842
See, my nephew was nannying her. And
then he went back to nursing school.

60
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,851
And ever since he left,
she won't fall asleep,

61
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:50,715
which means that I don't fall asleep
are you up for this job?!

62
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,384
I...

63
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:55,700
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

64
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:59,758
See, I can run the background
checks on the nannies.

65
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:03,015
Of course, not to mention, the drug
testing, the psychological briefings.

66
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:07,231
But I want to hire you both to
psychically read the best candidate.

67
00:03:07,248 --> 00:03:11,605
Look, chief. With all due respect, I think
our services might be better utilized...

68
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:15,780
Your services are best utilized
by doing exactly what I say.

69
00:03:15,874 --> 00:03:18,550
You are not my first choice,
Mr. Spencer.

70
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:21,113
And I cannot stress
how important this is.

71
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:23,729
I... Need... Sleep!

72
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,727
All right, so, uh, while we're
looking for this babysitter...

73
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:28,628
Nanny.

74
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,187
How about we also hop on board
the yacht bandit case?

75
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:35,500
- Because I think...
- Oh, no.

76
00:03:35,702 --> 00:03:37,589
No, no, no.
No, no way.

77
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:40,331
If I'm hiring you privately,
then this is the only case

78
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,119
that you're going to be working on.

79
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:43,678
I mean, when you're working
on police cases,

80
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:46,411
it's not like you take
private cases as well.

81
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:49,208
Or do you?

82
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:50,628
- No.
- No.

83
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,688
- Of course not.
- We don't do that.

84
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:54,515
- That would be unprofessional.
- It would break the psychic/client...

85
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:56,053
- We wouldn't even think of it.
- Code.

86
00:03:56,054 --> 00:03:58,626
Great. You can go ahead
and leave the door open.

87
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:02,185
Well, Harry, you and deeshaw
start a timeline.

88
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:04,682
McNab, I want you to help Schwartz
go over the witness statements.

89
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,836
Dobson! I want you on tactical!

90
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:11,760
- Where the hell is Dobson?
- Look, Gus, a real case.

91
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:15,763
What do you have?

92
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:20,697
Something something Lassiter's case.
Dude, this blows with a capital z.

93
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:23,467
Shawn, this is the only case
we're supposed to be working on.

94
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:25,440
Besides, it's really important.

95
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,382
Nannies are essential parts
of today's working nuclear families.

96
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:30,072
They're babysitters who drive.

97
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,456
Might I remind you
that this is a private case

98
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:35,100
for the chief of police to find
a caretaker for her child?

99
00:04:35,116 --> 00:04:38,100
If we screw this up, we'll be on
her bad side for pretty much ever.

100
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,400
Gus, you're not going
to find a nanny on the internet.

101
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:43,523
If they're posting there,
they're already too desperate.

102
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:45,000
It's like online dating.

103
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:47,223
Remember when you went
on matchmaker.Com?

104
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:49,652
You mean when you posted a profile
of me without my knowledge?

105
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,758
Right... And all the women
who responded were complete freaks.

106
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:54,316
That's because you said
I was looking for a woman

107
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,462
who was strong enough to hold me.

108
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,940
I didn't think they would
take it literally.

109
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,251
Look, dude, all the good nannies are
employed. We gotta do some field work.

110
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,899
We gotta find the right nanny
and steal her for chief Vick.

111
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:08,278
We should go to a playground
in a really good neighborhood.

112
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:09,781
That's actually a good idea.

113
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,278
Plus this way, we can race
on the monkey bars.

114
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:21,758
You know, Gus, we may be working
the lowest stakes case

115
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:23,711
of our short careers,
but there's something nice

116
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:27,002
about just sitting and enjoying
a sunny day at the park.

117
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:29,209
Shawn, concentrate.

118
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:32,167
Look over there.
The one in the over alls.

119
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:34,019
She seems to be using
reverse psychology

120
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:36,845
on that ten-year-old, which is
actually a pretty good idea.

121
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:38,900
- You know what's nota good idea?
- What?

122
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:43,810
Pineapple and movie theater
popcorn flavored jelly beans.

123
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,124
- That's disGusting.
- Shawn, stop spitting.

124
00:05:47,145 --> 00:05:48,515
You're scaring the children.

125
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:52,084
Hi. Would you like some candy?

126
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,699
I can't say that I blame her.
These are disGusting.

127
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:00,258
I mean, these are really horrible.

128
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:03,986
- Why can't I stop eating them?
- That's it. We're splitting up.

129
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:05,066
You're freaking out the kids.

130
00:06:05,077 --> 00:06:06,325
- And me.
- Fine.

131
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:11,579
Thank you for that. I'm serious.

132
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,371
I mean, I thought this was supposed
to be a safe neighborhood.

133
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,066
Just because you're rich
doesn't mean you're safe.

134
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:18,938
Marissa, get off of her now!

135
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:21,640
So you know Annie,
she worked for the bermans.

136
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,397
She had to go to the police
station because they thought

137
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,949
she might be a material witness

138
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,259
'cause of when the house
by them got robbed.

139
00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:31,740
So... Dakota!
Let someone else go on the slide!

140
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:35,697
They spoil that little girl so hard.

141
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:37,200
So then, an...

142
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:42,541
Perry! Luke!

143
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:44,222
I'll be sitting right here.

144
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,560
Remember, stranger danger!

145
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:50,200
"Stranger danger."
the parents make me say that.

146
00:06:50,558 --> 00:06:54,348
Hi, I'm Shawn.
I'm, uh, I'm a manny around here.

147
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:57,203
Oh, I'm Ada.
This is Jaynie.

148
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:00,093
- Are you with an agency?
- No, I don't model.

149
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:02,400
Strictly a manny.

150
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:08,122
Um, no, most of the families
in this neighborhood

151
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,920
- get their nannies from our agency.
- Oh, which one is that?

152
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:12,075
Red balloon.

153
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:13,970
You should talk to them
about getting reassigned.

154
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,044
Ada's freaking out
because she doesn't feel safe

155
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:19,502
- working in the heights anymore.
- Why not? Oh, gosh.

156
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:21,630
Is there a lot of crime around here?
What kind?

157
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:23,961
- Just some burglaries.
- Just?

158
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:25,566
All these houses.

159
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:28,645
- Only three.
- Three that we've heard about.

160
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
They all happen in, like,
the middle of the day,

161
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:34,354
and all of them had security systems
and everything, and it didn't matter.

162
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,760
Yeah, but it's not like it's
your stuff they're stealing.

163
00:07:36,775 --> 00:07:39,515
So what do you care?
I don't like to be around it.

164
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:43,316
Cody! Wyoming, get your foot
out of that dog!

165
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:53,630
- Hi.
- Hi.

166
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:55,761
Which one is yours?

167
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:59,012
Oh, uh, I'm the nanny
for those two.

168
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:00,850
Oh, really.

169
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:02,519
Do they always fight like that?

170
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:03,844
Pretty much.

171
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:07,646
- Which one's yours?
- Oh, no kids. Just me.

172
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:11,886
So what are your thoughts
on discipline?

173
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:13,829
Do you spank?

174
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:21,255
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

175
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:22,488
You're welcome.

176
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:24,352
Is that your nanny right there?

177
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,792
No. She is.

178
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,400
So she doesn't always pay attention
to where you are, huh?

179
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,232
It would be pretty easy for you to get
away and she wouldn't even know.

180
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,868
Kids. I just want to eat 'em up.

181
00:08:52,895 --> 00:08:55,903
None of these nannies will talk to me.
Even the kids are avoiding me.

182
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:57,998
Tell me the truth. Do I smell weird?

183
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,739
Nah, it's just the usual.
Jerk chicken and new car smell.

184
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:03,664
Look, I was talking
to those two nannies, right?

185
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,874
Oh yeah? You think they may
be right for chief Vick?

186
00:09:05,894 --> 00:09:08,435
Nah. They're terrible.
Yelling at the kids, gossiping.

187
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,104
All they paid attention to
is themselves.

188
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:14,384
But here's the good news, this
neighborhood is rife with crime.

189
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:15,766
See what I mean?

190
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:17,668
Shawn, I think you're forgetting
why we're here.

191
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,104
Did you really just do that?

192
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:21,181
What?

193
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:22,412
Hey, guys!

194
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:24,711
Buzz!

195
00:09:24,726 --> 00:09:29,337
Listen, I got a call about two creepy
dudes hanging out in the playground.

196
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:31,401
Really.
I haven't seen anything.

197
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:32,547
But I'll keep my eyes open.

198
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:34,660
Yeah, we've just been here
hanging out in the bushes.

199
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:38,151
Oh, boy.

200
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:40,156
Sorry about this.

201
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:49,585
I'm so sorry.

202
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,747
- Hey, no hard feelings, right?
- Of course not.

203
00:09:52,947 --> 00:09:56,154
I mean, if you have to have
a Jackie Earle Haley moment,

204
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,812
you'd... You want it to be
from bad news bears.

205
00:09:57,842 --> 00:10:00,252
- Maybe breaking away.
- Not little children.

206
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:03,470
Listen, I'd be happy to give you guys
a ride to wherever you need to go.

207
00:10:03,484 --> 00:10:04,300
Attention all officers.

208
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:07,499
We have a call on a 4-5-9
break-in at 3192 roscoe.

209
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:08,988
There. We need to go there.

210
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:11,800
- You need to go to a crime scene?
- Yeah, it's crazy.

211
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,685
The chief asked us to look
into any new burglaries

212
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,452
in the neighborhood
while we were here...

213
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,498
- At the park.
- Okay. Fine. Hop in.

214
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,935
No. Why you always get
to sit in the front?

215
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,874
I called shotgun.

216
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:24,445
- No, you didn't.
- Shotgun.

217
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:34,633
Chief Vick better not
catch us here, Shawn.

218
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,465
Would you relax? She's not gonna
show up at some random burglary scene.

219
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,795
We spent all afternoon
on that nanny thing.

220
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:41,869
This is like a coffee break.

221
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:47,852
The coolest coffee break ever.

222
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:58,788
- This is so wrong, Shawn.
- That must be why it feels so good.

223
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:04,769
- We already have a case.
- Gus, we can do both.

224
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,589
It's called multitasking.

225
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:09,038
Okay, looks like somebody
came home.

226
00:11:09,053 --> 00:11:11,414
Kicked off their shoes.
Made some chamomile tea.

227
00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:14,092
What ever happened to throwing back
a few beers after work?

228
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:15,594
Whatever happened to cleaning?

229
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,731
This is disGusting.

230
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:25,543
Whoever broke in, managed to disarm
security, find the safe and open it.

231
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:26,820
And killed a guy.

232
00:11:27,256 --> 00:11:30,109
So this is where Mr. Teatime got steeped.

233
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:31,803
That doesn't even make sense.

234
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:34,224
Got brewed?
Got tea bagged!

235
00:11:34,254 --> 00:11:35,938
That must be what killed him.

236
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:39,332
- Good eye, Gus.
- Thank you.

237
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:42,264
So Mr. Teatime
wasn't feeling well.

238
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:45,136
He comes home early,
surprises the intruder.

239
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:47,628
The murder didn't have a weapon.
Reaches for the first thing he can find.

240
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:50,668
Didn't mean to hurt anybody.
He's just a normal thief, right?

241
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:53,781
Dude... I bet this is connected
to those robberies

242
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:55,293
the nannies were talking about.

243
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:57,461
Chief Vick!

244
00:11:57,741 --> 00:11:59,259
Man, we gotta get out of here.

245
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:02,507
I think walking like this
makes everything more exciting.

246
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:08,293
I do not think this is a good idea.

247
00:12:08,323 --> 00:12:10,864
She was clear about only wanting us
to find her a nanny.

248
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:12,173
Are you kidding me?

249
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:14,773
I'll have a psychic vision about
the whole string of robberies.

250
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,568
- She will love it.
- I haven't finished the report yet.

251
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:18,490
- Is your other arm in a sling?
- Excuse me?

252
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:20,718
I don't want excuses, Carlton.
I just want the report.

253
00:12:20,737 --> 00:12:23,041
- I'm not giving excuses.
- Then why are you still talking?

254
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,446
Head detective, my ass.

255
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:28,947
- Uh, listen, I can finish the report.
- I can do my own job, O'Hara.

256
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:31,820
- I know you...
- I can do my own job, O'Hara!

257
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:37,319
Who finished the coffee,
didn't make a fresh pot?

258
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:39,270
I mean, who does that?

259
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:42,648
What kind of person acts like that?

260
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:47,791
Ooh, Shawn, Gus, hi!
Good to see you.

261
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:50,055
Come on in. Come on in.

262
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:53,765
- So you found me a nanny.
- Actually, we were working on that when...

263
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,848
I had a vision.

264
00:12:54,878 --> 00:12:57,840
It was a robbery turned to murder.
There's a light...

265
00:12:57,848 --> 00:12:59,322
Oh, do you know who the murder is?

266
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:02,179
Unless you can name me the murder in
ten seconds, then I'm not interested.

267
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,764
Ten, nine, one.

268
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,079
I hired you to find me a nanny,
and that's it.

269
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:07,463
Yes, that's it.

270
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:09,862
Absolutely. But, chief,
I have this feeling.

271
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:14,133
Mr. Spencer, I thought you understood
that when I hired you, this was to be

272
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:17,329
your top priority.
Your only priority.

273
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,289
It is. This is it.

274
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,890
In fact, we even narrowed it down
to the final three candidates.

275
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:27,901
Go find three candidates.

276
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:33,314
This has to be connected to the
other burglaries in the heights.

277
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,724
Don't even think about it.

278
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:37,198
No, you go ahead. I'm just
going to say a quick hello.

279
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:49,889
Hold on a second. I might need
to make that a large.

280
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:51,090
Can I help you?

281
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:53,418
You guys want to go in with me
on a meat-lover's cheesy crust?

282
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:55,113
No time for a pizza party, Spencer.

283
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:57,760
Nothing helps a big case more than
a belly full of pepperoni.

284
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,888
- We're busy.
- Okay.

285
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:01,939
Keep it a medium,
but yes to the crazy bread.

286
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:03,503
It makes sense
that all these burglaries

287
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:05,178
were connected 'cause
they all have the same M.O.S.

288
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,187
Daytime burglaries...

289
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,110
Hidden valuables found and stolen.
Disabled alarm systems.

290
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:11,682
Yes. That's what I was
in the middle of saying.

291
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:14,084
- Well, then say it.
- Uh, hold on a second.

292
00:14:14,444 --> 00:14:18,629
- Uh, jalapeyo poppers, cinnamon wings?
- Walk away.

293
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:22,754
Thank you very much for your time.

294
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:25,205
Now if you all can just
wait here for one sec...

295
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:27,430
Shawn, I'm glad you're here.

296
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:28,959
'Scuse me.

297
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:31,627
I'm feeling really good
about these nannies.

298
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:34,933
Jean has a background in Montessori,
and Sue has some interesting ideas

299
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:37,610
about establishing nap time
routines that I kind of like.

300
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,800
All right.

301
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,668
No. No good.
None of them.

302
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,079
What? Why?

303
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,680
Slob, psycho, slut.

304
00:14:49,852 --> 00:14:52,227
I spent hours interviewing them,
calling references.

305
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,227
And you just come in here
and dismiss them in two seconds?

306
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:56,633
Well, take a look, Gus.
The one on the far left is a slob.

307
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,459
She's smelling her own armpit.

308
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,283
Psycho there has been
scribbling in her diary

309
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:04,428
- from the moment I walked in.
- So? Maybe she's just creative?

310
00:15:04,774 --> 00:15:06,924
It's the same sentence
over and over again.

311
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,333
Now, I don't know what
that sentence is,

312
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,269
but there is no configuration of words
that makes that behavior acceptable.

313
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:13,485
Fine. That still leaves Fiona.

314
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,782
Why is she a slut?

315
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:18,510
That was more me
predicting her future.

316
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:27,130
- Aw, man.
- What?

317
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:30,210
All right, everybody out.

318
00:15:30,258 --> 00:15:32,634
Sorry, ladies.
The position has been filled.

319
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:34,098
Don't drive angry.

320
00:15:37,294 --> 00:15:39,745
- Why did you do that?
- Gus, she was getting married.

321
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,776
So? She can still work
for chief Vick.

322
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:45,132
No, she's consumed
with planning her wedding.

323
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:47,998
She was studying that bridal
magazine like it was a textbook.

324
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:51,461
After she's done with that, she'll
be on the fertility fast track.

325
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:53,009
Then she'll have her own baby.

326
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,641
And chief Vick
will be out another nanny.

327
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:58,502
And I do not want to have
to do all this work again.

328
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:00,240
And what work exactly are you doing?

329
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,586
How about progress on our actual case?

330
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,859
Looks like all these robberies
are inside jobs.

331
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:08,002
The key is finding the
connection between the victims.

332
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:10,771
But we don't know anything about
the other houses that were robbed.

333
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:12,097
All I'm saying is...

334
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:14,695
I'm just trying to say...
Don't make me slap you, Shawn.

335
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:17,605
Check it out. I got some snapshots
of the evidence.

336
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:33,714
Well, at least two of the victims
have something in common.

337
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:37,963
- What?
- Startek Security company.

338
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:43,739
And you don't find it strange that all
four of these homes had startek security,

339
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:45,980
yet none of them were secure?

340
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,308
Actually, people get overconfident
with a security system and neglect

341
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:51,894
taking even the most
basic precautions.

342
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:54,673
Like turning the system on, for example.

343
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:59,193
So you're saying all of these homeowners
just forgot to turn on their alarms?

344
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,500
That's one theory.

345
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:02,674
- That's a pretty flimsy theory.
- Yeah, I don't think that's what happened.

346
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:04,854
What I'm going to need
from you, spock, is a list.

347
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:08,177
I just told you, yes,
I am second in command.

348
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:10,018
But my name is Gary Mills.

349
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:11,350
I'm at a loss.

350
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,400
You'll have to talk to bones
and get back to me.

351
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:15,851
Jules. Lassie.

352
00:17:15,877 --> 00:17:17,156
Why are you here?

353
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:20,697
Well, I was just in the neighborhood
and my ears started tingling.

354
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:23,603
And then they got pointier.
Oh, and my hand.

355
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:25,592
My hand started doing this.
All on its own.

356
00:17:25,622 --> 00:17:27,171
- Like in that show.
- Star trek.

357
00:17:27,186 --> 00:17:28,991
And this is startek.

358
00:17:29,002 --> 00:17:30,430
Hilarious. What's your point?

359
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,949
Excuse me for trying to take you
on a wonderful psychic journey, okay?

360
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:36,535
I think there's a connection
between this place

361
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:39,300
and the string of robberies
in the heights.

362
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:40,504
How'd you know
about the robberies?

363
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:42,354
I, uh, felt a burning
when I sat down.

364
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:43,961
Forget I asked.

365
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:47,735
Please excuse my pseudo-colleague's
presence. Now assuming...

366
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:49,378
That all four of our homeowners...

367
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:51,589
Didn't just "forget"
to turn on their systems,

368
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:55,416
I think a startek employee could've gotten
those access codes to break in.

369
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:56,833
You remind me of one
of my professors.

370
00:17:56,848 --> 00:17:59,044
Did you ever teach
at devry school of technology?

371
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:02,328
- No.
- Well, I had one of these professors

372
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:04,575
who often had harebrain
theories like yours.

373
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:06,549
If we were really gonna rob
any of the houses

374
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:10,218
that we monitor, we would choose one
in a totally higher income bracket.

375
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,800
Take a look at this mansion, huh?

376
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:16,972
I would Rob this bad boy
so fast your head would spin.

377
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:18,788
Really. How?

378
00:18:18,818 --> 00:18:21,794
- Lassiter, I don't...
- O'Hara, please.

379
00:18:22,237 --> 00:18:23,365
What do you want, Shawn?

380
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,192
Gus, there's no way
it can be these security guys.

381
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:29,161
I mean, they want to be cops, but
they're really just on domestic detail.

382
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:33,023
Really? Like you're a wannabe detective
following a case we're not even on,

383
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:35,264
when you should be finding
chief Vick a new nanny.

384
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:36,582
I trust you to head that up, Gus.

385
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:39,727
Meanwhile, I'm going to borrow your car, check
out those other houses that were robbed.

386
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:40,810
No way.

387
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:44,050
I will not have my echo be a part of
your flagrant disobeying of the chief.

388
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:45,225
Use your motorcycle.

389
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:48,970
Dude, I can't do recon with that
on suburban streets.

390
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,285
Help me find the nanny,
and then I'll take you.

391
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:53,311
Gus, I'm a grown man.

392
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:55,521
I don't have to depend
on others to drive me around.

393
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,403
- Okay?
- Fine.

394
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:01,958
Ooh, slow down. Slow down.

395
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:04,061
What are we looking for again?

396
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,273
My kinkajou. He's got to be
around here somewhere.

397
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:09,017
Maybe he's more in the middle
of the block.

398
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:12,420
- Your kinka-what?
- Kinkajou.

399
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:14,464
It's a 12-inch,
monkey-like mammal.

400
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:16,343
It's become quite vogue
to keep as a pet.

401
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,990
Dermot mulroney had one
named "Baby Love."

402
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:21,566
but I named mine
"Red Hot Monkey Love."

403
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:22,641
All right, Shawn, cut the crap.

404
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:24,791
I'm only doing this 'cause you
agreed to mow the lawn.

405
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:27,368
It's time to fess up.
What is really going on here?

406
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:29,823
All right, fine. There's been a string
of robberies in the heights,

407
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:32,979
and I need to get a closer look at
one of the houses that got robbed.

408
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:34,497
Why didn't you just say so?

409
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,843
Because it's more fun
to say "kinkajou."

410
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:41,009
All right, which one?

411
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:42,436
That one.

412
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:46,020
Yeah? Well, that's
a stupid house to Rob.

413
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:48,770
Does anyone live up
to your standards?

414
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,710
Maybe we can get a hold
of the burglar's number.

415
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,574
You can call. Tell him
how disappointed you are.

416
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:54,882
Shawn, take a look
at all the houses on this block.

417
00:19:54,897 --> 00:19:58,800
Of all of 'em, tell me why that one would
be your last choice to break into?

418
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:00,979
- I don't know, dad. I...
- Shawn. Now.

419
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,565
Because all the other houses
are easier targets

420
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:15,280
than the one that actually got robbed.

421
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,439
Neighbor two houses down
has been gone for several days.

422
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:19,725
Didn't bother to suspend
their newspaper delivery.

423
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:21,733
- Good. What else?
- The house on the other side

424
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,673
is completely hidden
by those trees and bushes.

425
00:20:23,688 --> 00:20:25,123
It's the perfect vantage point
for a burglar.

426
00:20:25,153 --> 00:20:26,371
Especially during the day time.

427
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:28,476
Not to mention our house
has a security system.

428
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:30,018
And bars on the windows.

429
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:32,069
This was not a crime
of chance, Shawn.

430
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,739
That house was chosen for a reason.

431
00:20:35,664 --> 00:20:38,747
- There can only be one.
- What?

432
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:40,612
I thought we were doing
lines from "Highlander".

433
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,673
My bad.

434
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:46,438
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait. That sensational feeling.

435
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,694
That is the quickening.

436
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:52,589
Everyone can do connery.
Your lambert sucks.

437
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:55,752
- At least I have a lambert.
- Hey, Ada, it's Jaynie.

438
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:58,358
They let me out early.
Want to meet up tonight?

439
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:03,864
A nanny wouldn't be able to afford
coach sunglasses, am I right?

440
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:06,600
Well, she should be able to.
Nannies are criminally underpaid.

441
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:09,244
Right. Because our children
are our most precious resources.

442
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:11,003
Because children are
maddening hellions.

443
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:14,696
A great nanny can make all the difference
in the world. Haven't you seen nanny 911?

444
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:16,876
No, I'm still trying to catch up
on my dog whisperers.

445
00:21:16,906 --> 00:21:18,696
Nannies on there are brilliant.

446
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,499
I wish I had one of 'em
when you were a kid.

447
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:23,100
Uh, don't beat yourself up, pop.

448
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,558
Sure, most of my good traits
come from mom.

449
00:21:26,723 --> 00:21:28,392
But you, uh...

450
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:31,900
No, that's really all I got.

451
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:39,571
Okay, chief.
Let me begin by saying no.

452
00:21:39,586 --> 00:21:41,722
We have not found you a nanny yet.

453
00:21:41,752 --> 00:21:44,950
But I have had a vision
about nannies, ironically.

454
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,559
Rings of nannies!

455
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:52,766
Uh, rings of...
of around my collar.

456
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:54,997
Of thieves. Rings of thieves!

457
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:58,284
Supplementing their paltry incomes
as nannies.

458
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:04,443
Rogue nannies robbing their bosses'
aykroyds and belushis.

459
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:07,538
Neighbors! Robbing
their bosses' neighbors!

460
00:22:08,103 --> 00:22:11,862
Chief, if I can just get a little
closer to these robberies...

461
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:15,301
And... And... And we would still
find you a nanny eventually.

462
00:22:19,974 --> 00:22:23,373
Oh, Mr. Spencer. I'm sorry.

463
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:25,381
I must've fallen asleep.

464
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:27,305
That is so creepy.
Your eyes were wide open.

465
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:31,008
Yeah. I learned to do that
back when I was on stakeouts.

466
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:35,232
I have never been so
sleep-deprived in my life.

467
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:38,530
But thank goodness
you found me a nanny.

468
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:39,734
N... no.

469
00:22:39,763 --> 00:22:41,508
No, we haven't...
We haven't done that yet.

470
00:22:42,651 --> 00:22:45,590
- Then why are you here?
- That's what I was saying.

471
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:48,755
I've got some very strong
psychic rumblings

472
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,439
about those robberies.

473
00:22:53,524 --> 00:22:58,858
I gave you explicit instructions.
And you're here to tell me

474
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,324
that you've completely disregarded
everything I said?

475
00:23:02,354 --> 00:23:03,870
No, no, no.
Not completely.

476
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:09,071
Well, look, if you're gonna put it
like that, then sort of.

477
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:11,682
Well.

478
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:14,785
Let me put it
just like this.

479
00:23:14,814 --> 00:23:16,814
And listen very closely.

480
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,822
Because I want you
to get it clearly

481
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:21,205
this time.

482
00:23:21,463 --> 00:23:24,756
You... Are...

483
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:27,274
Fired.

484
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:29,003
Yeah.

485
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:31,694
Ah. From which case?

486
00:23:31,695 --> 00:23:33,034
All of them.

487
00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:39,487
Trying to solve that case is what got us
in trouble in the first place, Shawn!

488
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:42,000
She said she wanted me
to name the murder.

489
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,489
As long as I could do it
in ten seconds.

490
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,900
And as long as it didn't
distract from the nanny search.

491
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,500
So you find the perfect nanny
before she does.

492
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:51,919
I'll find the murder for the police.
And voila, she's loving us again.

493
00:23:51,949 --> 00:23:55,077
And exactly how is this plan different
from what we were doing before?

494
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:58,158
Because now we're renegades, dude.

495
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,827
It's so hardcore!

496
00:23:59,858 --> 00:24:01,722
Working without
the chief's knowledge.

497
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:04,264
Racing against a ticking clock
for her approval.

498
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,165
It's gonna be
so much more exciting.

499
00:24:06,598 --> 00:24:08,382
- Can't you feel it?
- No, Shawn.

500
00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:10,652
I don't feel it.
I feel depression.

501
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,163
I feel a series
of missed payments on our rent.

502
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:16,005
That's the only thing that motivates me
to think we need to fix this.

503
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,055
I need to get more information
on those two nannies from the park.

504
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:21,209
Maybe get into that agency
where they both work.

505
00:24:21,224 --> 00:24:22,833
And how do you plan on doing that?

506
00:24:22,864 --> 00:24:24,758
It's not like you can pretend
you're a nanny.

507
00:24:24,803 --> 00:24:27,866
The agency does do extensive security
checks on who they hire.

508
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:31,964
But not necessarily on the parents
who hire them.

509
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:33,635
Come on, buddy. What do you say?

510
00:24:33,665 --> 00:24:35,425
Do a little cameo onmy two dads?

511
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:37,485
That show was canceled
for a reason, Shawn.

512
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:40,541
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to find
someone else to co-parent with.

513
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:46,356
I was gonna let you be Greg Evigan.

514
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:51,443
I just think that startek
security is a dead end...

515
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:55,400
Okay. All right. Fine.
What if I go investigate a different...

516
00:24:56,303 --> 00:24:59,597
Yes. I know that you
are lead detective, Lassiter.

517
00:24:59,924 --> 00:25:03,006
Oh, going through a tunnel.

518
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:04,530
Gotta go.

519
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,665
Please let me eat my frustration
in peace, Shawn.

520
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,936
There's this dark cloud
surrounding you.

521
00:25:11,966 --> 00:25:14,424
It's starving your chi. Yeah.

522
00:25:14,454 --> 00:25:16,980
And down at the station,
I can see a raccoon

523
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:18,439
with dark circles under his eyes.

524
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:21,443
No... Her eyes.
Oh, god. It's the chief.

525
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,330
Chief Vick is becoming chief coon.

526
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:25,400
And she's... She's lashing out
at everyone.

527
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:27,238
- That's true.
- Especially Lassie.

528
00:25:27,268 --> 00:25:29,629
Who in turn is taking
his frustrations out on you.

529
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:31,719
Look, Jules,
you gotta take your chi back.

530
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:33,132
Take it back.

531
00:25:33,286 --> 00:25:34,519
And that means
doing something big.

532
00:25:34,553 --> 00:25:38,207
Something risky. Something that'll
help you blow this case wide open.

533
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:43,329
Marry me, Juliet.

534
00:25:52,729 --> 00:25:54,790
What are your opinions
on ferberizing the baby?

535
00:25:54,824 --> 00:25:56,117
Oh my god. Never.

536
00:25:56,145 --> 00:25:57,544
That's disGusting.

537
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,290
Do you have any remedies
for teething pains?

538
00:26:03,318 --> 00:26:04,371
Two valiums.

539
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:06,220
You would give the baby valium?

540
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:07,840
Oh, no. Of course not.

541
00:26:07,841 --> 00:26:09,933
Those are for me so I can deal
with the crying.

542
00:26:09,963 --> 00:26:11,542
I just give the baby
half a valium.

543
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:21,672
Look, Jules, you don't
actually have to marry me, okay?

544
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:25,500
Just... Just pose as my wife when we
go to the red balloon nanny agency.

545
00:26:26,245 --> 00:26:29,133
I need to get a better psychic vibe
on a couple of their nannies.

546
00:26:29,157 --> 00:26:30,555
And you need a nanny why?

547
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,102
Two particular nannies.

548
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,722
I think they're behind
the robberies in the heights.

549
00:26:34,752 --> 00:26:37,820
So you're saying that this string
of high-tech cat burglaries...

550
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:39,407
One that ended in murder...

551
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:41,600
Were caused by a couple
of 19-year-old nannies?

552
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:44,260
Don't be ridiculous.
Only one of them is 19.

553
00:26:44,261 --> 00:26:46,846
The other one's a slightly zaftig,
polish nanny in her thirties.

554
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:48,508
Shawn, I can't help you do this.

555
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,676
Oh no, no, no.
You wouldn't be helping me.

556
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,437
I would be helping you...

557
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:54,907
To solve the case the way
you think it needs to be solved.

558
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:58,426
Jules, to get your chi back.
Investigate these nannies with me.

559
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,605
Otherwise your chi's going
to shrivel up and starve to death.

560
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:03,658
You need to feed your chi.

561
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:06,305
Besides, I wasn't
going to say anything,

562
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:08,275
but I had a vision
of us being married.

563
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,378
I know it's probably
this undercover thing

564
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:15,159
we're gonna do, but it might have been
a vision from our future.

566
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:19,180
Mr. And Mrs. Juliet Spencer.

567
00:27:19,296 --> 00:27:20,499
O'Hara?

568
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,913
Fine.

569
00:27:21,914 --> 00:27:22,980
I'll do it.

570
00:27:23,853 --> 00:27:26,003
She said yes, everybody!

571
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:28,311
She loves me so much!

572
00:27:30,193 --> 00:27:32,208
But only for detective Work.

573
00:27:32,238 --> 00:27:34,479
I don't buy into this
whole husband and kids thing.

574
00:27:34,515 --> 00:27:36,425
Marriage is just a contractual obligation

575
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,980
that the state mandated centuries ago
when wives were considered property.

576
00:27:39,995 --> 00:27:42,100
But if we are going to pretend...

577
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,584
This is what our wedding was like.
It's sunset on a beach in Antigua...

578
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:50,907
So then I walk down the aisle to an a
cappella version of James Taylor's "only one."

579
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:54,333
and by this time, the flower girls
have tossed the peony petals into a soft,

580
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:55,702
- butterfly formation.
- Hi.

581
00:27:55,735 --> 00:27:58,000
I'll take you in to see
the head of the agency now.

582
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:02,648
Hi, I'm Abby Daniels.

583
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,841
And it says here that you are
Mr. and Mrs. Levon Tostig.

584
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:08,819
That's correct.

585
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,346
Why don't you tell me a little bit
about your child.

586
00:28:11,376 --> 00:28:15,535
Well, we had little millicent
in a home birth with a doula.

587
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:18,738
And afterwards, Levon here

588
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:21,041
buried my placenta in the backyard.

589
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,432
Some of our nannies are very
environmentally conscious.

590
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,344
They're into homeopathic methods.

591
00:28:26,345 --> 00:28:28,014
- Great.
- What kind of background checks

592
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,142
do you run on these nannies?

593
00:28:29,155 --> 00:28:31,997
Well, I'm glad you asked that,
because the safety of your children

594
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:34,835
is something we pride ourselves on
here at red balloon.

595
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,767
I like that very much.

596
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:39,143
Well, why don't I show you
a little bit around our offices.

597
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:40,929
And you can see some of the services
that we offer here.

598
00:28:40,937 --> 00:28:42,400
Great.

599
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:47,653
So getting any psychic vibrations
on your two suspects yet, Levon?

600
00:28:47,683 --> 00:28:50,000
I think I got thrown off
picturing your placenta.

601
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:53,971
Now this is Steve Hitchcock.

602
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:56,700
He's in charge of the baby
bonding cameras we install.

603
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,979
Part of every
nanny placement package.

604
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,995
What are baby bonding cameras?

605
00:29:01,025 --> 00:29:03,762
Well, they're a series of web cams
we set up in your home.

606
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,822
You can log on
any time during the day

607
00:29:05,841 --> 00:29:07,962
and see how your child
and the nanny are doing.

608
00:29:08,142 --> 00:29:11,300
- So you're spying on them.
- Oh, no. Not at all.

609
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,798
The nannies are aware
these cameras are installed.

610
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,550
It's more to keep in touch
with your child.

611
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:19,764
Not to mention having the nanny know
you may be watching her at any time,

612
00:29:19,774 --> 00:29:22,150
it encourages her to be
extra responsible.

613
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:24,543
You're the only ones with the
access to the camera feed.

614
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:27,815
You sign onto the web site using
a unique password only you know.

615
00:29:27,845 --> 00:29:29,725
So you can see, not only do we run

616
00:29:29,762 --> 00:29:33,867
extensive background checks on our nannies,
you can check on them whenever you like.

617
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:38,363
Ooh, uh, sweetie, why don't you tell them
how we decorated little Millie's room,

618
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:39,864
then they'll know
how to set up the cameras.

619
00:29:39,873 --> 00:29:40,985
Excuse me.

620
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:45,234
Well, we decorated with
a raspberry and sage theme.

621
00:29:45,235 --> 00:29:49,898
And then we did this pinstripe wallpaper
that really accented the sea foam green

622
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,357
that we had done in the crown molding.

623
00:29:51,568 --> 00:29:53,176
Perfect timing, Gus.

624
00:30:09,936 --> 00:30:13,214
A nanny wouldn't be able to afford
coach sunglasses, am I right?

625
00:30:18,254 --> 00:30:21,186
Of course, I love what nate berkus did
on Oprah's nursery theme week.

626
00:30:21,201 --> 00:30:24,073
So I took his idea and I did
the long, flowing curtains.

627
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:25,909
But only on two of the windows,
even though there's four...

628
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:27,994
Hon, we should probably get going.

629
00:30:28,672 --> 00:30:29,672
Great!

630
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,883
Well, if you have any other questions,
you just let us know.

631
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,747
- Thank you. I will.
- Or e-mail.

632
00:30:34,762 --> 00:30:36,041
E- mail is good too.

633
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:39,627
O'Hara.

634
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:41,802
Uh-huh. Where?

635
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,528
Okay, I'll be right there.

636
00:30:45,054 --> 00:30:46,137
That was Lassiter.

637
00:30:46,152 --> 00:30:48,837
Wants me to meet him at some
exotic reptile shop on central.

638
00:30:48,852 --> 00:30:51,426
Said they found some of the
stolen merchandise from the robberies.

639
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:54,736
Ooh. Can I come? I'd love to see
what my wife does at work all day.

640
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:58,320
And then before every nap time,

641
00:30:58,335 --> 00:31:00,545
we read good night moon
and the giving tree.

642
00:31:00,555 --> 00:31:02,435
Those are my favorite books.

643
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,585
And then she lies down
for a 45-minute nap,

644
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,006
which I keep track of
in my client sleep chart.

645
00:31:07,191 --> 00:31:08,665
I love charts.

646
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,109
When can you start?

647
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,176
All right, when'd the items come in?

648
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,949
Jeez Louise. Does it look like
I keep records in quicken in here?

649
00:31:18,302 --> 00:31:20,001
Maybe tuesday.

650
00:31:20,115 --> 00:31:22,777
Can you at least describe the person
who sold them to you?

651
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:24,912
You get used to lookin'
at lizards all day,

652
00:31:25,002 --> 00:31:26,822
people all start to look alike.

653
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:31,195
- Was it a man or a woman?
- Boy, you ask some toughies.

654
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:33,958
- I think it was a guy.
- Pasty white guy?

655
00:31:33,988 --> 00:31:35,702
Beatnik haircut.
Stupid grin?

656
00:31:35,718 --> 00:31:36,876
I don't think so.

657
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,400
Was he roly-poly like a puffer fish?

658
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,729
Spencer, what the hell?

659
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,786
- Yeah. Yeah, he was.
- Now I'm seeing red.

660
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:51,988
Was he red-faced like a kol fish?

661
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:54,132
Exactly.

662
00:31:54,185 --> 00:31:57,328
And did he spit a lot
like a komodo dragon?

663
00:31:57,464 --> 00:31:58,636
Just like a komodo.

664
00:31:58,652 --> 00:32:02,034
Great! I'll take this description down
to our sketch artist at the aquarium.

665
00:32:02,057 --> 00:32:04,725
All right, tell me exactly
which items this fish man sold.

666
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:06,839
Your vision kinda sounds
like that red-faced guy

667
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:08,764
from the red balloon
nanny agency... Steve.

668
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:10,294
I was thinking the kool-aid guy.

669
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:12,317
- But yours probably makes more sense.
- Yeah.

670
00:32:12,318 --> 00:32:13,459
I'm going to head
back down to the station,

671
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:15,121
investigate them a little more.
See if I can get a warrant.

672
00:32:15,144 --> 00:32:18,121
So it's not the nannies that are
responsible for the burglaries.

673
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:20,515
- It's the agency.
- Yeah.

674
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,962
Gus, I'm so glad you called.
You're about to be a lot gladder.

675
00:32:27,992 --> 00:32:31,391
Chief Vick has officially forgiven us.
I just found her a nanny.

676
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:32,443
Oh, that's perfect.

677
00:32:32,473 --> 00:32:34,383
I think I just figured out
who the bad guys are.

678
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:36,473
The best part is,
she can start right away.

679
00:32:36,503 --> 00:32:40,250
Her security check is already done, because
she works for the best agency in town.

680
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:41,327
Oh, no.

681
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:42,847
Please don't say the...

682
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,787
Red balloon nanny agency.

683
00:32:49,642 --> 00:32:51,266
This is the part I hate.
Waiting for warrants.

684
00:32:51,281 --> 00:32:52,514
Oh, we're not waiting for warrants.

685
00:32:52,515 --> 00:32:54,062
Can you please tell me
what we're doing here?

686
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:55,942
Look, Gus, we know the ws of the crime.

687
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:59,058
We know the who, we know the where.
We're pretty solid on the where of.

688
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:00,582
We're pretty sure of the where to for.

689
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:02,297
- We're scratch on the what chamacallit.
- Shawn.

690
00:33:02,327 --> 00:33:04,019
- 'Cause that's self-explanatory.
- Shawn.

691
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,192
We don't have the how.

692
00:33:05,222 --> 00:33:07,583
Why do we need to know the how
if the guy's gonna be arrested?

693
00:33:08,763 --> 00:33:12,387
Dude, I'm the one that has
to do the wrap-up, remember?

694
00:33:12,432 --> 00:33:15,489
You want me to get up there
with eggs benedict all over my face?

695
00:33:15,504 --> 00:33:18,497
The Canadian bacon in my hair?
Hollandaise dripping down?

696
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:22,932
I needzing. I'm a psychic.
I gotta see everything.

697
00:33:23,982 --> 00:33:25,139
Come on.

698
00:33:29,998 --> 00:33:31,998
Oh, hi, Levon.
What are you doing here?

699
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:33,944
This is Samuel Coen.

700
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:36,470
He's my best friend and godfather
to my little millicent.

701
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:40,963
Now he's, uh, very overprotective and he
insisted on coming by and getting a feel

702
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,023
for the folks that are going to be
caring for his little goddaughter.

703
00:33:43,024 --> 00:33:44,552
Oh, well, guys, I'm so sorry.

704
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,616
But Steve and Abby, they're out doing
home interviews with clients.

705
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:50,653
You know what, we're okay with waiting.

706
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:03,275
Dude, she has a headache.

707
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,515
Start whistling something
by philip glass.

708
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:19,463
Okay, you know what, guys?
You don't have to wait out here.

709
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:22,215
You know, I bet you'd be more comfy
in Mrs. Daniel's office.

710
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:24,941
- You sure it's no trouble?
- No, no. Not at all.

711
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:26,419
You know where it is, right?

712
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,878
Thank you.

713
00:34:32,174 --> 00:34:34,171
- What kind of clues are we looking for?
- Any kind.

714
00:34:37,151 --> 00:34:40,935
- Somebody chews tobacco.
- How about some new clues?

715
00:34:50,932 --> 00:34:53,524
- What are you doing?
- Dude, I think this thing opens up.

716
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,270
Scratches on both sides of the wall.
It's, like, a secret door or something.

717
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,628
Nicely done, Gus.

718
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:13,713
These are feeds from the baby bonding
cameras that the agency installs.

719
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:14,886
It's kind of creepy.

720
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:17,149
Yeah, especially since the only ones
that are supposed to be able

721
00:35:17,164 --> 00:35:19,885
to access these feeds
are the parents themselves.

722
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:21,155
This is our proof, Shawn.

723
00:35:21,156 --> 00:35:24,730
They watch the footage from the cameras,
get the security codes, see where people

724
00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:27,015
are hiding their valuables,
and case out their houses.

725
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,603
We got it, Shawn.
Let's go.

726
00:35:28,604 --> 00:35:30,152
- Whoa!
- What?

727
00:35:30,347 --> 00:35:31,986
No, that doesn't make any sense.

728
00:35:32,012 --> 00:35:34,568
None of the houses that got robbed
had nannies working in them.

729
00:35:44,665 --> 00:35:48,575
Dude, it wasn't the houses with the nannies.
It was the houses next door.

730
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:52,315
Juliet's gonna have a hard
time serving the warrant

731
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,427
here at the red balloon,
when the person she's trying

732
00:35:54,457 --> 00:35:56,475
to arrest is sitting
in chief Vick's living room!

733
00:36:00,712 --> 00:36:04,246
Sweet black licorice.
I've got the how.

734
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,283
I've got to get Jules
on the phone right away.

735
00:36:06,328 --> 00:36:08,058
Time is of the essence here!

736
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:10,123
Jules, it's Shawn.

737
00:36:10,424 --> 00:36:11,777
First of all, how are you?

738
00:36:12,202 --> 00:36:13,585
Oh, that sounds nice.

739
00:36:13,608 --> 00:36:16,120
Secondly, meet me
at chief Vick's house pronto.

740
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:18,575
I've had a big vision.
Top seven of all time.

741
00:36:18,602 --> 00:36:19,715
Let's go.

742
00:36:26,724 --> 00:36:28,964
Thanks for getting here
so quickly, guys.

743
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:32,257
- Where's your baby gift?
- A what?

744
00:36:32,362 --> 00:36:33,415
The baby gift.

745
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:35,388
Lassie, we're about
to enter the chief's home.

746
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:38,140
You can't just barge in,
guns a blazing. This is delicate.

747
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,210
The suspect could be holding
chief Vick's baby.

748
00:36:40,212 --> 00:36:42,468
Or we could make
chief Vick very, very angry.

749
00:36:42,513 --> 00:36:45,014
- You don't want that.
- Nobody wants that.

750
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:56,020
Probably should've given you this
sooner, but, uh, happy baby gift.

751
00:36:56,053 --> 00:36:57,527
Uh, thank you.

752
00:36:57,959 --> 00:37:01,462
It's a mini rattle and also
a low calorie breath freshener.

753
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:04,081
Oh, great. Is there anything
I can do for you guys?

754
00:37:04,126 --> 00:37:05,615
We just wanted to say hi.

755
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:11,342
Oh, uh, Shawn,
I'm glad that you're here.

756
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:14,277
I just wanted to apologize
for snapping at you the other day.

757
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:16,143
Chief, there's no need.
Really.

758
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:18,500
Oh, well, you know, I was just so mad,
I just wanted to strangle you.

759
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:20,444
But I admit I was wrong.

760
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:22,587
I realized I was overreacting
after I tried to run

761
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:24,794
my husband over after he left
the garage door open.

762
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:28,479
- But this agency that you and Gus found...
- Yeah, about...

763
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:30,539
- Mrs. Vick!
- Yeah.

764
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,585
I just finished up
installing the cameras.

765
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:37,814
Guess who just fell asleep?

766
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,316
- Iris is sleeping?
- Like a lamb.

767
00:37:40,317 --> 00:37:43,308
Please tell me that your other nannies
are as good with children as you are.

768
00:37:43,338 --> 00:37:44,496
Even better.

769
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:49,669
- You guys did a great job.
- Yeah. About that...

770
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,857
Mr. And Mrs. Tostig.

771
00:37:50,872 --> 00:37:53,082
I didn't realize you knew Mrs. Vick.

772
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:57,770
Mr. Softy would like
to say a few words.

773
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,881
Oh, Shawn, I really don't think
that this is the time.

774
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:03,626
I thought his name was Levon.

775
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:05,491
What's that?

776
00:38:06,814 --> 00:38:09,867
The bear snores really loud, he's pretty
sure the turtle's really an alien,

777
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,198
and all the monkey wants to do
is play pull my finger.

778
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,995
Oh and somebody just put in
some video cameras?

779
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:17,597
Yeah, I just set up
a bunch of them. So?

780
00:38:17,614 --> 00:38:19,208
Well, they're not
normal video cameras.

781
00:38:19,238 --> 00:38:22,395
They're all high-techy
with army-grade resolution.

782
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:24,585
What? What's that, Fella?

783
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,938
Look up?

784
00:38:26,774 --> 00:38:28,564
That's just a fan, Silly.

785
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:34,499
Lassie, what's that?

786
00:38:38,245 --> 00:38:40,124
This is the extella 5400.

787
00:38:40,145 --> 00:38:43,078
They're the baby bonding cameras,
so you can check in.

788
00:38:43,108 --> 00:38:46,627
The extella 5400
retails for over $10,000.

789
00:38:48,288 --> 00:38:49,491
I'm fine.

790
00:38:50,468 --> 00:38:52,949
I'm seeing angles
and pivots and divots.

791
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,119
Well, no divots.

792
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:56,104
But it sure is fun to say
those back-to-back.

793
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:58,472
Pivots and divots and pivots and
divots and pivots and divots and...

794
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,051
Who wants to give that a shot?

795
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,268
- Give what a shot?
- Shots. That's it. Exactly.

796
00:39:03,532 --> 00:39:05,732
But I don't see any shots of nannies
playing with babies.

797
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:08,665
In fact, there's no babies at all.
I'm seeing jewelry boxes and safes

798
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:10,995
and entrances and exits
and security keypads.

799
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:12,912
But... But from where?

800
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:20,538
- From the houses next door.
- What are you talking about?

801
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:26,415
There's a baby sleeping.

802
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,550
I'm talking about...

803
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,345
Shawn, will you stop!

804
00:39:35,753 --> 00:39:37,573
Well, it's like a mine field!

805
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:43,618
I'm talking about casing out houses

806
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,874
next door to the ones
your nannies work at.

807
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,836
I'm talking about a string of robberies,
one of which went terribly wrong

808
00:39:49,851 --> 00:39:53,745
when all of a sudden your witness-less
crime got witnessed.

809
00:39:53,746 --> 00:39:55,399
And then it became murder.

810
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,044
That ridiculous.

811
00:39:57,045 --> 00:39:59,476
Is it as ridiculous as having
a secret panel in your office

812
00:39:59,506 --> 00:40:01,882
where you can plan
all your robberies?

813
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:04,115
You had access to each and every one

814
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,476
of those baby bonding cameras,
and you manipulated them.

815
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:08,972
Not to check on any nannies,
but to case the houses

816
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,182
next door to capture
security alarm codes

817
00:40:11,197 --> 00:40:14,219
so you could break into
those houses undetected.

818
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:17,921
I'd say that's pretty ridiculous.

819
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:20,579
Though not as ridiculous
as Denise Richards

820
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:24,330
playing a nuclear physicist
named Christmas Jones in a Bond movie.

821
00:40:25,565 --> 00:40:27,189
But still.

822
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,633
Look, I don't know what this
guy's deal is, but we gotta go.

823
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:35,665
This guy's deal is that he's a psychic.
Who happens to work for the police.

824
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:36,729
Oh, really?

825
00:40:36,774 --> 00:40:38,292
Yeah, really.

826
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:42,269
The Santa Barbara police department,
which I'm the chief of.

827
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,600
Anybody ever tell you
you look like a puffer fish?

828
00:40:57,738 --> 00:40:58,971
Sorry.

829
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,920
- I can't believe it all worked out.
- I know.

830
00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:05,734
All I had to do was get
the fruit bowl assortment

831
00:41:05,735 --> 00:41:08,937
from Garrett bell's Jelly Bean factory
and every flavor's delicious.

832
00:41:08,938 --> 00:41:10,291
I'm talking about with chief Vick.

833
00:41:10,306 --> 00:41:12,900
Her nephew's transferring to a
nursing school in Santa Barbara.

834
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:14,752
In two weeks,
she'll have her old nanny back.

835
00:41:14,797 --> 00:41:16,391
Mm, pomegranate.

836
00:41:16,406 --> 00:41:18,106
I wonder what she's going
to do in the meantime.

837
00:41:18,132 --> 00:41:19,441
Oh, I took care of that.

838
00:41:19,817 --> 00:41:22,854
You mean, after I scoured the city and
couldn't find anyone, you just stumbled

839
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,638
upon a nanny responsible enough
for chief Vick?

840
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,915
That I did.

841
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:30,565
Give me a little whoop. Whoop.

842
00:41:33,503 --> 00:41:36,676
And you gotta admit...
The man knows how to work a baby.

843
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:39,294
Shawn!

844
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:41,599
Don't look back.
Just keep walking.

845
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,477
Shawn! Shawn!

846
00:41:42,522 --> 00:41:43,800
Where are you going?

847
00:41:43,807 --> 00:41:47,010
Come on, you said five minutes!
Don't you dare leave!

848
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,534
I'm smelling something really foul
coming out of this thing!

849
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:57,300
