00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,500
Hey, shawn. Over here, buddy.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,900
Hey, how about a big hello for your
old man You haven't seen in a week?

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,800
Hi, old man. Can we go now?

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,200
No. Where's gus?

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,700
I think he got abducted.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,000
No, there he is. Hey, gus.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,900
<i>Perfect.</i>

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,100
Step on it.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,900
You two didn't team up for the
pinata contest This year, did you?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,800
No...

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,500
he ditched me For
golden boy jason cunningham,

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,800
<i>Who wins every year.</i>

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,600
And i got stuck with the kid
who wore the jacket The entire week.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,100
It's a million degrees out!

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,100
Why don't you go
live on hoth, you freak?

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,500
<i>You keep the pinata.</i>

17
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,200
Okay, well, you keep the ribbon,
Killer "b"-- I insist.

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,400
<i>- Hi, mr. Spencer.
- Hey, gus. Hop in.</i>

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,300
All right.

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,400
Hey, killer "b."

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,300
If you're looking for your pocket
knife, It's still in my back.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,900
Where's your clown pinata?

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,300
It's not a clown.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,100
And wouldn't you like to know?

25
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,300
??

26
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,200
Oh, no.

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,700
<i>Who are you?!</i>

28
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,800
What are you doing?!

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,300
That's what you get for bein' a harlot,

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,000
Thank you very much.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,900
Hello?

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,000
Is somebody there?

33
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,600
I have a bat.

34
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,100
Hello?

35
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,400
Ohh, sissy, thank god.

36
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,400
No, i'm fine.

37
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,500
It's just so quiet
when you're here all alone.

38
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,700
I took some cold medicine.

39
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,800
I think my eyes are
playing tricks on me.

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
No, no, no. You guys go have fun.

41
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm just gonna drink
some tea and hit the sack.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,400
Tomorrow, i will be as good as new.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,600
Okay...

44
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,600
bye.

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,900
beyond awful.

46
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,100

00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,700
<i>Dude, i'm telling you,
you cannot add lettuce.</i>

51
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,200
<i>It completely takes you
out of the burrito.</i>

52
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
You don't seem to mind
if a taco has lettuce.

53
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,400
That's because everyone knows
the taco has assimilated, gus.

54
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,700
The burrito remains authentic.

55
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,000
It's the rollie fingers of mexican cuisine.

56
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,900
- Oh, my god.
- What the--

57
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,900
- Isn't that your--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,200
It's my rick astley pinata.

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,700
- I think it's dead.
- Rick astley?

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,300
That's what that thing
was supposed to be?

61
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,500
Oh, come on.

62
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,900
You sound like the judges.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,100
Look at it. It's painfully
obvious even now.

64
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,900
It looks more like ann margaret.

65
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,600
What?

66
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,300
I had it narrowed down
to eric stoltz or boris becker.

67
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,500
- Jason cunningham?
- Killer "b"!

68
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,800
'Sup man? Salmon run!

69
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,100
Shawn, it's good to see you.

70
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,900
Cunningham.

71
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,200
Who would make an eric stoltz pinata?
That doesn't make any sense.

72
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
And what are you thinking, man?

73
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,100
Children walk by here every day
Carrying their hopes and dreams.

74
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,600
My sincerest apologies.

75
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,400
Heh, i couldn't resist.

76
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,600
We found it when we dredged the lake.

77
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,700
Dredged the lake?

78
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,400
You went back to camp tikihama?

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Yeah, i been there...

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
and i bought it.

81
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,400
- What?
- Yeah, i'm reopening it.

82
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,200
Friday.

83
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
??Let's take a walk.

84
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,400
Sure.

85
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,100
All right, what's
the rub here, cunningham?

86
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,400
I know you didn't
track us down after 20 years

87
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,900
To tell us that friday the 13th
is your new life plan.

88
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,700
Hey, look, i read the paper.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,800
All right, you guys uncovered a dinosaur

90
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
And rescued a mummy
in the same calendar year.

91
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,700
I need your help.

92
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,300
As detectives and as old friends.

93
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
We're--We're sort of
missing a counselor.

94
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,100
What does that--

95
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,500
What does that even mean?
"Sort of missing."

96
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
I know what you're thinking,

97
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,300
And there are million
possible explanations.

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,200
Her name is annie.
She's kind of a loner.

99
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,700
<i>She's a hiker.
She never tells us where she's going.</i>

100
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,200
Look, i don't say this very often.

101
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,500
But it sounds like one
for the proper authorities.

102
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Are you kidding?

103
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,400
I call the cops, and the press
gets a hold of this, They'll go crazy.

104
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
The camp murder stories
will start all over,

105
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,900
And i'll be dead in the water
before i ever open.

106
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,200
Shawn, please.

107
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,600
<i>Look, i poured 20 grand into this.</i>

108
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,100
All right? It's all i've got.

109
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,500
Look, i'm--I'm sorry, cunningham,

110
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,000
But my gut is saying no.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,700
<i>- In thx.
- Shawn...</i>

112
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,400
If you can't do it for that poor girl
Or an old friend with a good heart,

113
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,400
Do it for the children.

114
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,500
Those kids. It's for the kids.

115
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,600
All right.

116
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,400
May i help you, detective?

117
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,700
Just thought these might
brighten the place up a bit.

118
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,300
Wow, what a wonderful sentiment
For you to buy these for me.

119
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,900
Actually, i bought four,
just to have options,

120
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,200
But these are by far
and away the worst ones.

121
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,400
Must be poisonous.

122
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,300
Tried to give 'em to the lady
down at fingerprinting, but...

123
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,000
Turns out she's a man.

124
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,000
From birth.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,900
I see, well, thank you, i guess.

126
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,900
You're welcome.

127
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,900
Here, you get to choose
between these two.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,100
They didn't make the cut, either.

129
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,900
Be careful, though.
One of 'em's expired.

130
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,100
may i ask what brought
on This generosity?

131
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Yes, you may.

132
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,500
I have a very special dinner date
this evening With my estranged wife.

133
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,100
You're...reconciling?

134
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,900
Things have been pretty good
between us lately.

135
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
We've been friendly.

136
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,500
Beyond friendly. I've been asking her
to go to gerard's for months,

137
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,800
And she's finally accepted.

138
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,500
gerard's. That's a surprisingly
chic choice, detective.

139
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,900
It's where we had our first date.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,900
Back then, it was a greasy spoon.
I got diarrhea for a long while.

141
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,300
They actually changed
some health codes because of it.

142
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,900
But...new beginnings and all.
You get the connection.

143
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,900
Well...heh...

144
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,600
I really, truly wish you the best, carlton.

145
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,300
- Thank you.
- But maybe...

146
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,100
you should be a little cautious...here.

147
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
How so?

148
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,300
you know, The whole eggs in the
basket, Jumping with both feet.??

149
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,000
Hey, you're a woman.
Is it too early to bring up kids?

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,200
Man, this place brings back
so many bad memories.

151
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,700
Shawn, you need to
let the pinata thing go.

152
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,400
We were 11. I wanted to win.

153
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,200
It wasn't about winning or losing, gus.

154
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,100
It was about you and me

155
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,900
Being an unflappable
two-Headed pre-Teen phenomenon.

156
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,600
Like the mowry twins--
Sticking together no matter what.

157
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,500
You're all doomed!

158
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,800
All right, we're out of here.

159
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,000
Shawn, stop it.

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,400
He's kidding. Look at him.

161
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,700
<i>Yeah, clearly.</i>

162
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,000
He has a folksy sense of humor,
The garrison keillor of tikihama.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,200
Turn around before we get stabbed.

164
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,500
Where is he going?

165
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,500
I don't know.

166
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,100
This doesn't feel right, man.

167
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,600
We should not be here.

168
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Look...let's just get it done.

169
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,200
We'll find the girl and get home For
some berner wurstel in a couple hours.

170
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,300
My treat.

171
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,300
'Scuse me.

172
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,700
- Is jason around?
- We're old friends of his.

173
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,400
I think he's inside Trying to
figure out what's eating gilbert grape.

174
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,100
Turns out it was a flesh-Eating virus.

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,600
Oh, i get it. You're the funny guy.

176
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,900
You guys must be counselors.

177
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm clive.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
In charge of all water
activities Or anything wet.

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,100
Billy, fitness/nutrition.
Body sculpting.

180
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,600
I'm a bit of a fitness buff myself.
I'm training for the santa barbara 1k.

181
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
That's only about 3,000 feet.

182
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,400
There's not a lot of training involved.

183
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,000
Hello!

184
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,200
- Oh, please don't do this.
- Do what?

185
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,700
Every time you see a marginally cute girl,

186
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,900
- You lose all semblance of reason.
- I don't do that!

187
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,400
Just like you don't flick
your nose with your thumb

188
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,500
When you're trying to act cool.

189
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,000
Jason, we made it.

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,900
<i>- What the hell happened to him?
- He's fine.</i>

191
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,000
<i>- Those are nurse's shoes.
- They're probably very comfortable.</i>

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,400
They're both left feet.

193
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Hello, burton.

194
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,000
Shane.

195
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,400
<i>I'm so glad you could drop by.</i>

196
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,300
I had some Biscuits in the oven.

197
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,100
But i forgot to light the pilot.

198
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,500
Jason, are you feeling okay?

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,900
I'm super.

200
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,900
Did i tell you about the biscuits?

201
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Uh, my name is shawn spencer.
I'm a psychic.

202
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,200
- This is my partner lumpkin--
- My name is gus.

203
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
- But you can call me slicks.
- Slicks?

204
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,400
What's your name?

205
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,100
Sissy, arts and crafts.

206
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,800
- How are you?
- Good, thank you.

207
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,500
Anyway, we are here to help track
down Your missing counselor.

208
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,300
I thought you said annie called.

209
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,400
I thought she-- I thought she--
I thought she would call.

210
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,500
She hasn't-- She hasn't called.
But we're sure she's fine.

211
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,600
Jason....what haven't you told 'em?

212
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,200
- You guys are aware that this is a--
- Billy...

213
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,900
Let's keep our business our business.

214
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,900
Okay?

215
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,900
This is just about annie.

216
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,100
Now...

217
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,000
show them the camp house.

218
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,300
- What's with the doll?
- It's for the kids, shawn.

219
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,400
And i know what you're doing.

220
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,700
You're trying to interpret
everything as creepy

221
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,200
Just because you're jealous of jason.

222
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,700
Let's just get this over with.

223
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,800
This place is musty.

224
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,200
It's vintage, shawn.

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
- Hello, sissy.
- Hi, slicks.

226
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,600
<i>This is the last place
we know annie was for sure.</i>

227
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,500
I talked to her on the phone last night.

228
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,200
She wasn't feeling well at all.

229
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,900
Well, then...

230
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,100
My guess is that she didn't get up
at the crack of dawn And go for a hike.

231
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,800
So you guys really came here
when you were kids, huh?

232
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,400
<i>Well, you know how it is.</i>

233
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,700
<i>Do the bunk bed thing.</i>

234
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,100
Make some lanyards. Catch a fish.

235
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,300
Go home early because some repairman
Got electrocuted in the swimming pool

236
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,500
And the camp closed.

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,400
Oh, my god, that really happened?

238
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,600
Yes. It was a tragic accident.
And it happened 20 years ago.

239
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,300
??

240
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,600
What is that?

241
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,400
Laundry shack.

242
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,900
<i>Who's doing laundry?</i>

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,100
Not me--We're not
supposed to use the dryer.

244
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,700
It drains too much energy,
And our generator's messed up.

245
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,400
??

246
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,100
It doesn't mean anything.
She could be fine.

247
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,300
Billy's right--

248
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,200
Maybe she was painting a fire engine
And decided to go for a swim.

249
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,800
This is not paint, shawn.

250
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,800
Who could do something like this?

251
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,400
Anybody for The toothless old guy
on the rusty schwinn?

252
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,800
You mean the janitor?

253
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,700
Janitor?

254
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
take a look around. I really don't think
you're getting your money's worth.

255
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,900
<i>Crazy old erwen.</i>

256
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,400
Erwen wouldn't hurt a fly.

257
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,600
Would anybody like some tea?

258
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,100
Maybe something black?

259
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,000
You don't have to decide now.
I'll just put some on.

260
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,500
Okay, what is that about?

261
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,300
Tea isn't the worst idea ever.

262
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,000
It's a great stress reducer.

263
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,900
This cycle just started.

264
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,000
Which means whoever did this is close.

265
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,700
<i>I say we go looking for her.</i>

266
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,500
Clive?

267
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,600
Define looking for her.

268
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,900
Because i don't really feel like
Losing any of my extremities.

269
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,800
We stay within shouting distance.

270
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,200
We meet back at the office at 6:00.

271
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,800
Nobody's one minute late. You got me?

272
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,700
Let's twist this.

273
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
you guys aren't gonna
Let me go alone, are you?

274
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,600
- Of course not.
- Yes, we are.

275
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,700
We were actually thinking of
staying here In the laundry shack.

276
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,300
Really scoping this place out
with a fine-Tooth comb.

277
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
please, gus.

278
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,100
Annie could be out there somewhere.

279
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,000
I hear you.

280
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,200
She's right, shawn.
Annie needs us.

281
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,400
Excuse him.

282
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,500
We've never met annie.
She could be a terrible person.

283
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,600
We've suddenly fallen Into
some kind of slasher movie scenario

284
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,400
And we're making
all the classic mistakes.

285
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,700
We stay here, shut the door,
Wait for help.

286
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,400
At least take something pointy!

287
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,400
- Annie!
- Annie!

288
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,700
It'll be okay, sissy.

289
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,200
I'm sure there's a perfectly logical
explanation For all of this.

290
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,600
Oh, no, there isn't.

291
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,800
But i appreciate your attempt
to put me at ease.

292
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
I am literally shaking over here.

293
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,900
Don't worry.

294
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,900
They call me fearless guster.

295
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,600
I--

296
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,700
And there's plenty more
where that came from!

297
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,200
Annie?

298
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Annie!

299
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,600
Somebody there?

300
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,100
??'Cause i'm right here.

301
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,700
Hello.

302
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
May i help you, sir?

303
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
I certainly hope so.

304
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,000
I have a reservation under
carlton lassiter and spouse.

305
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Your reservation is for 7:00 p.M.

306
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,200
- That's right.
- It's 5:20.

307
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,400
Yeah, well...

308
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,100
Parking wasn't quite the rattlesnake
I had anticipated.

309
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,800
Well, sir, none of our wait staff
Has arrived as of yet,

310
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,600
But i can assure you the table
will be ready At 7:00 sharp.

311
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,500
I'll wait.

312
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,600
You're...going to stand here?

313
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,800
I'm a peace officer.
I'm practiced in surveillance.

314
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,400
I can remain motionless
for up to eight hours, if need be.

315
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,000
The bar is also open
if you'd prefer to sit.

316
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh, that's good too.

317
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,100
Victoria.

318
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,400
I was kind of nervous,
so i got here early.

319
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,600
Me too.

320
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,800
Hello?

321
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,100
Shawn?

322
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,100
<i>Jules!</i>

323
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,900
<i>You made really good time.</i>

324
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,000
Shawn, are you hiding in that closet?

325
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,200
<i>No.</i>

326
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
<i>No, i'm not.
That's a negative.</i>

327
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,700
<i>How have you been?</i>

328
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,400
Okay, this is weird.

329
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,100
Here's the thing, jules,

330
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,600
And i wouldn't possibly have
expected you to know this.

331
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,100
But sometimes the psychic
headlights Can get a little bright.

332
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,000
And i have to balance that
effervescence With dark space.

333
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,300
Closets are very good.

334
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,900
Coffins are great.

335
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Shawn, you sounded really
spooked on the phone.

336
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,700
What's going on?

337
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,100
Yeah, uh, solid question,
And i'm gonna bring you up to speed.

338
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,100
But...

339
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,700
first, would you mind coming back in

340
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
And catching me
doing some inverted sit-Ups

341
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,600
Or perhaps lifting
a large anvil over my head?

342
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Where's billy?

343
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,300
I don't know. We split up.

344
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,500
Well, did you find anything?

345
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,900
I stumbled upon erwen's living
quarters, And i mean that loosely.

346
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,000
<i>Gus! There you are.</i>

347
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,800
<i>- Look who i found.
- What the...</i>

348
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,200
I'm clive. I'm hilarious,
and i have no girlfriend.

349
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,000
Hi, i'm juliette, and i'm a cop.

350
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,400
Nice rejection. Very clean.

351
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
Have you seen billy?

352
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,600
No.

353
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,500
He said 6:00 sharp, not a minute late.

354
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,100
And then he said, "let's twist this."

355
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,500
It's ten past.

356
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,800
Listen, if half of what
shawn has told me is true,

357
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,600
None of you are Being very smart.

358
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,100
Everyone needs to
get inside, together, now.

359
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,000
Let's go.

360
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,300
Come on.

361
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,700
So you don't really know
this jason guy at all?

362
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
Any of you?

363
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,200
<i>I can't believe
i let him talk me into this.</i>

364
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Careful, sissy.

365
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,200
- You of all people should--
- Forget that. Enough is enough.

366
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,800
Jason wasn't completely
honest with you guys, he...

367
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,800
Can't imagine what you were
about to say, sissy.

368
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,900
Can't even imagine.

369
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
- Who is she?
- Detective o'hara.

370
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,400
One of santa barbara's finest,
Both literally and figuratively.

371
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,500
Judas.

372
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,300
Pardon me?

373
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,600
No cops!

374
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
<i>You gave me your word, spencer.</i>

375
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You ruined everything!

376
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,100
Look, jason, we have
blood-Soaked pajamas In the dryer,

377
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,300
and now billy's missing too.

378
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,000
I think it's safe to say That
there is a clear and present...

379
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,200
Danger here.

380
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,300
I'm finished.

381
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,800
I can't open the camp now.

382
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,500
Not now!

383
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,600
Listen, Jason, I am not the enemy here.

384
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
I think we all just need to stay together.

385
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,300
Nobody had to know.

386
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,400
I could have fixed this.

387
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,900
You destroyed me!

388
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,200
Iago!

389
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,300
What does the parrot from aladdin
have to do with this?

390
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,300
He's not well. We can't just let him
go out there all by himself.

391
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,300
All right.

392
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,800
No, you stay here with us.

393
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,200
She's right, you stay here
with Sissy and Clive.

394
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,800
Gus and I will bring Jason back.

395
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,000
This is our case. He's
our responsibility.

396
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,700
You must be out of your mind if you think
for one second I'm going out there.

397
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,900
I've seen enough slasher movies to know that
when the brother goes off to the woods,

398
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,400
He doesn't even sorta come back.

399
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,100
Sorry.

400
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,600
Ll cool j made it all the way
through deep blue sea.

401
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,800
That was in the water, Shawn, with sharks.

402
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,000
And Sam Jackson's ass still
got swallowed whole.

403
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,700
Fine. I'll go alone.

404
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,500
I don't like this, Shawn.

405
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Well, your hands are a little bit tied,
aren't they?

406
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,900
Plus, when you showed up, I was hiding
in a closet.

407
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,300
So I figure I'm due to man up.

408
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,100
If I'm not back in exactly four minutes,
please go looking for me.

409
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,400
But really start giving it some
serious thought after two.

410
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,900
And if you think that there's anything
even slightly amiss after 45 seconds,

411
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,000
You're the leader here.

412
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,400
I told you we never should have come
back to this place.

413
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Jason!

414
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,100
Dude, we took a vote!

415
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,800
Staying in the house and not wandering
around the woods won!

416
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,700
It's pretty much unanimous.

417
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,000
Aw, man, we can totally do laundry
in the morning!

418
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,800
Annie?

419
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,200
Are you okay?

420
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,300
Are you okay?

421
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Are you okay...

422
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,100
Annie?

423
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,100
Uhh!

424
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,900
Drop it, or I will shoot you
where you stand!

425
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,900
No! Don't shoot!

426
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,100
I have the shot!

427
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,400
Don't shoot!

428
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,700
Shawn, what are you doing?

429
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,700
This isn't friday the 13th!

430
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,200
It's April fool's day!

431
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Same formula!

432
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,700
But with a killer twist ending.

433
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,500
You...

434
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,300
Almost had me.

435
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,800
Your humble servant, my lord.

436
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Bravo...

437
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,100
Wow. Mr. Cunningham.

438
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,200
Bravo!

439
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,300
You did it, Shawn.

440
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,200
You really are something special.

441
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,800
What the--

442
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,100
Detective, please forgive me. You...

443
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,600
You so were not supposed to be here.

444
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,800
Somebody tell me what's
going on right now.

445
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,900
In a nutshell...

446
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,300
Jason's reopening camp tikihama,
all right.

447
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,900
But it's not for the kiddies.

448
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,600
I mean, take a look around. He didn't even
refill the swimming pool.

449
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,800
No, he's got something much
darker in mind.

450
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,500
A murder camp.

451
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,600
It's like those mystery train things.

452
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,500
But way, way cooler.

453
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,000
Every other week, eight people
pay to have

454
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
the bejesus scared out of them

455
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and solve a once-In-A-Lifetime
whodunit murder mystery.

456
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,900
I needed a rehearsal, heh.

457
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,600
And you two were in on this?

458
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,700
Only the setup.

459
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,400
The dry run Jason started caught me
by surprise.

460
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,200
Scared me senseless.

461
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,200
But, whoa! What a rush.

462
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,700
We all knew about the camp, but we had
no idea that we were gonna be

463
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,300
his little guinea pigs this week.

464
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
It was so weird!

465
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,000
I could sense that there had been
a struggle in the kitchen.

466
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,800
It's me, it's me.

467
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,000
It's okay. It's okay.

468
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

469
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,200
Quite a mess, but somebody...

470
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,700
Somebody covered it up.

471
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,800
That's amazing.

472
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,200
How did you know it wasn't real?

473
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,100
Well, I'm a psychic, Jason. There's
no reliable defense for that.

474
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,200
I could feel that nothing was
what it seemed.

475
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,600
But I couldn't have done it without Gus.

476
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
You were right, partner.

477
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,500
That wasn't paint on Annie's clothes.

478
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,000
Paint dries. So does blood.

479
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,800
But corn syrup mixed with
red dye number three,

480
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,100
Not so much.

481
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,200
That's how we do it.

482
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,300
Yin and yang.

483
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,200
I'm the spark that starts the fire.

484
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,800
Of course, that probably wouldn't
have occurred to me

485
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,500
If you hadn't wiped it all
over your pants.

486
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Buddy.

487
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,400
You see, my best friend can't
stand the sight of blood.

488
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,300
He's even fainted on occasion.

489
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,400
That's not true.

490
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,300
Wha--I don't believe you!
You were in on all this?!

491
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,800
Well, Jason called me a week ago,

492
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,700
And I figured this was
the perfect chance

493
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,800
to get Shawn back for an entire lifetime
of scaring the daylights out of me.

494
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,000
- Killer "b"!
- What?

495
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,100
So history repeats itself.

496
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,200
You two are my least favorite tag
team of all time.

497
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,300
Really, with Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff
on the table?

498
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,600
Wow...

499
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,800
You just made that reference.

500
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,700
Well, I'll tell you what, let me start
the apology train.

501
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,800
There is champagne on ice inside.

502
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
Maybe strawberries!

503
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
We should go inside.

504
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,700
One, Two, three.

505
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
Thank you very much.

506
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,900
Come on, Jules. Try to have some fun.

507
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,200
We're not being chased around by an
axe-Wielding maniac anymore.

508
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,900
It's kind of a sick little charade and been
a colossal waste of my time.

509
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,800
But...since it's not a crime
to be distasteful,

510
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,300
maybe I can hang out till
the storm passes.

511
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,400
I think I saw some chocodiles
in the fridge.

512
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,000
Tempting.

513
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,600
- I shall return.
- Hmm.

514
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,300
Crazy old man. What have you
done to yourself?

515
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,600
If you're trying to make it up to
the mountains this weekend,

516
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,500
Good luck.

517
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Highway 17 has been completely blocked by
an overturned logging truck.

518
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,500
Ugh. Perfect.

519
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,000
The wind probably brought down the only
tower we had in the area.

520
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,500
I'll radio for an ambulance.

521
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,400
Don't bother.

522
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,000
They won't be coming, and we
won't be going.

523
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
Not tonight. The road is
completely blocked.

524
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Of course it is.

525
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,200
A, uh, confidante told me
not too brazen--

526
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,900
and then I realized that I should
proceed with caution.

527
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,400
?? that's exactly my problem.

528
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,900
I never took any chances.

529
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,300
I didn't seize the moment I never...

530
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,400
let my emotions carry me.
I analyzed it all to death.

531
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,600
Pr-Protecting myself.

532
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,200
Or protecting something. I don't
even know what it is.

533
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
But that's why we're here.

534
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,400
- Mm-Hmm.
- In this place.

535
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,200
'Cause...i wanna restart.

536
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,400
I want a second chance at
a first impression.

537
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,200
So...here is something

538
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,800
from the guy with nothing to protect.

539
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,000
Heart on sleeve, hat in hand.

540
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,200
Oh, god.

541
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,400
Don't say anything.

542
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,000
Just...just put it on.
It is long overdue.

543
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,300
No, this is...

544
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,500
It's just too much.

545
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,000
Well, I've been working
some overtime lately,

546
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and sold some confiscated knives
on craigslist.

547
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And of course that stimulus check,
that certainly helped.

548
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,600
There's been a-- a big mistake.

549
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,500
What?

550
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,300
Is it...

551
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,500
Did i do something?

552
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,300
No, it's me.

553
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,400
I think, um...

554
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I think that I was not very clear
about my intentions

555
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,100
when I said that I needed to
meet with you.

556
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,400
What is this?

557
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,500
It's our divorce papers.

558
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,100
Nobody is to touch that body.

559
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,100
I can justify moving it
because of the storm.

560
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,700
But until further notice, that porch
is off limits.

561
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,800
Do we know what happened to him?

562
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,900
It's impossible to tell before
an autopsy,

563
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,200
But there are no clear signs of foul
play that I can see.

564
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,700
Well, he certainly didn't strike me
as much of a swimmer.

565
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,100
His trailer doesn't have
any running water.

566
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,200
He bathes in the lake.

567
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,900
Ugh, still nothing.

568
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,400
I want to know the second any of you
can use your phones.

569
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
I guess this kills the game
of strip cribbage

570
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,800
That I was trying to start.

571
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,500
No, let's do it. Anything to get
my mind off this day.

572
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,800
Come on, Gus.

573
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,200
Jason, you're playing too.

574
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Whatever you say, my dear.

575
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,600
Come on, Clive, you know you want
some of this action.

576
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,800
No, thanks. I got weird nipples.

577
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,500
Though it does seem appropriate
to play a game

578
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,600
with a dead guy on the porch.

579
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,800
I got a date in the den with
the moon patrol.

580
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,400
What about you, Annie? You in?

581
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,400
Um...no.

582
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,200
I want the rest of this muck off my neck.
I want a hot shower.

583
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,700
Uh, Annie, Where do you think
you're going?

584
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,300
Away from the animals.

585
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,600
Don't worry, you don't need to
babysit me, okay?

586
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,500
I'll just be in my cabin,

587
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,400
regretting the decision to take
this job in the first place.

588
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,000
Jules, may I have a word, please?

589
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,600
Something still feels off.

590
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,700
I'm getting some pretty strong vibes that
Erwen didn't have the big one

591
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,400
while he was exfoliating his armpits.

592
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,100
Can't you do better than vibes?

593
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,700
Jeff goldblum and Cyndi lauper couldn't.

594
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
How 'bout you let me have an honest
look at that body?

595
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,500
All right.

596
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,500
He's a little nicked up, but the current
carried him pretty far.

597
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,300
So it could be anything.

598
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,200
No touching, Shawn.

599
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,000
Didn't need to be said.

600
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,200
Anything?

601
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,500
It's not clear.

602
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,100
Not yet.

603
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,600
Strip cribbage, my ass.

604
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,400
Jason! You jerk!

605
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,400
That is not funny at all.

606
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,800
Get out of here.

607
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,100
Jason?

608
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,100
Aah!

609
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,800
What is that now, four in a row?

610
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,100
This is nuts.

611
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,100
You still have on your shoes and socks?

612
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,700
Do you even know how this game works?

613
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,300
Oh!

614
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,100
Wow!

615
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,200
Boy...billy.

616
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
I will give you everything
in Gus's wallet

617
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,400
if you put your pants back on.

618
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,600
Dude, please cover your junk.

619
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,000
Probably just a breaker.

620
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,900
Back in a flash.

621
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,100
You guys aren't afraid of
the dark, are you?

622
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,100
Thank you.

623
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,800
Carlton...

624
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,400
Let's not.

625
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,200
You know this has been coming
for a long time.

626
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,300
Honestly, let's just skip this part.

627
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,700
I signed 'em while you were
in the bathroom.

628
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,800
Really?

629
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,200
Two years ago, you would have thrown
them in the fire.

630
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,600
No, two years ago I would have
lit them on fire

631
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,000
And put them back in your purse.

632
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,600
I don't think this place
likes me very much.

633
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,800
I don't think I'll ever stop loving you

634
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,300
Not completely.

635
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Say something.

636
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,700
When...you first left me,

637
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,400
I may have had you followed

638
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And called your cell phone,

639
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,700
But...that doesn't matter.

640
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,600
It's not about the past anymore.

641
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,800
It's about tomorrow.

642
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,900
So I'm not gonna say a word.

643
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,500
But know that I want to.

644
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,900
I wanna scream to the sky that I would do
anything to get you back.

645
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,700
But I'm going to let you go.

646
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,300
Because that's what you want.

647
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,600
Once you walk out that door,

648
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,900
I'm gonna let go of everything
I've been holding onto.

649
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,000
So we can both have tomorrow.

650
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,600
Good-Bye, victoria.

651
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,800
Good-Bye, carlton.

652
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,900
Stupid breaker.

653
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,700
Jason. You scared the crap out of me.

654
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Dude.

655
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Finally.

656
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Shawn.

657
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,800
I stumbled upon Erwen's living quarters,

658
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
And I mean that loosely.

659
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:11,900
Clive.

660
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,200
Shawn, what's going on?

661
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,200
I think we have a very serious problem.

662
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,000
What the hell is this?

663
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,500
What the...

664
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,800
Clive killed Erwen.

665
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,200
I don't know why, but he did.

666
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,500
And now he's out there, and so are
billy and Annie.

667
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,500
Listen to me very carefully.

668
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,000
I want you all to stay together
in the living room.

669
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,800
Don't open the door for anybody but me.

670
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,800
- I'm coming too.
- No.

671
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,300
- We can cover more ground this way.
- Shawn!

672
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,800
We're not discussing this.
There's no time.

673
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,000
- Shawn.
- Buddy.

674
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,000
It'll be okay.

675
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,000
I'm gonna be right back.

676
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
You hold down the fort.

677
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,200
This is a disaster.

678
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,300
Oh, I hire a psychopath to work
in my murder camp?

679
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,500
What are the odds?

680
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
Let's just keep it together.
Nobody's getting in here.

681
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,400
We're gonna be okay.

682
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
What was that?

683
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
What was what?

684
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Aah! Jason!

685
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,000
Agh!

686
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,100
Jason!

687
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Get her out of here!

688
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,400
Get her out of here!

689
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,400
Get her--

690
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
Annie!

691
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
Annie!

692
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
Billy!

693
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,200
Uhh!

694
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,900
What are you doing out here?

695
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
He was in--the--

696
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,500
I don't understand!

697
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
He was in the house!

698
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,900
Oh, my god. Gus!

699
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,100
Stay here!

700
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,000
Uh-Huh.

701
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Gus!

702
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,600
You're okay!

703
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,400
You're okay. You're okay. You're okay.

704
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,700
Hey, you're okay, you're okay.

705
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,500
Uh-Oh.

706
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Aah!

707
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,300
No, no, no!

708
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,400
Clive...

709
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
You don't wanna do this!

710
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Gus!

711
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,300
Oh, but I do.

712
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,400
I'm quite sure of it.

713
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,600
You see, the man that died here
20 years ago was my father!

714
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Of course he was.

715
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,200
And you guys think it's funny?

716
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
It's fun?

717
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,300
You wanna reenact it
for a game?

718
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,600
Well, I can play too!

719
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,900
Shawn!

720
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,800
What are you doing here?!

721
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,900
I came in here to save you!

722
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,000
I beat him already!

723
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,300
I can see that now!

724
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,100
Here, take this!

725
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,100
This is a pool skimmer!

726
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,000
There's not a lot of options
here, Shawn!

727
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,200
Juliet!

728
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Clyde, I was a victim here too!

729
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You're one of 'em!

730
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,700
Aah!

731
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,700
And now you're gonna die!

732
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,100
Wait a minute! Whoa!

733
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,300
I don't even like Jason!

734
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,300
My pinata was a lot better than his!

735
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,900
What are you even talking about?

736
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,800
I don't know.

737
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,200
I was trying to make a point.
Things got personal.

738
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Aah!

739
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,300
Gus, what are you doing?!

740
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,600
I'm causing a diversion!

741
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,900
Uhh!

742
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,300
You're all the same!

743
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,600
You want murder and mayhem?

744
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,900
Well, you got it!

745
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,500
This is my game, and guess
who's gonna lose!

746
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,600
Gus, get back!

747
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,700
Agh!

748
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,100
Jules, a little help here!

749
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,200
I don't have a shot, Shawn!

750
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,500
- Take the shot!
- I don't have it!

751
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,800
- Get it!
- Aah!

752
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Shoot that mother--

753
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,800
Aah!

754
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,000
In t are you kidding me?!

755
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,000
Don't...move!

756
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,100
You're gonna be okay, Jason.

757
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,200
I'm so sorry. I never meant for anybody--

758
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
We know you didn't.

759
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,100
Neither did i.

760
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,000
Just--Time will heal.
You'll see.

761
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Just get yourself right.

762
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,400
I'm going with him.

763
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,100
Why don't you stay here with us?

764
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
I really should go.

765
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,400
I--After all, he is my fiance.

766
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,500
What?

767
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,700
I just wanted to say thank you

768
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,700
For shooting that whack job psycho killer
in the hand.

769
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,700
My pleasure.

770
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,100
And I know this probably sounds weird,

771
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,100
But even though I was really scared
and discombobulated and whatnot,

772
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,200
That level of pinpoint marksmanship
from you

773
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,600
is easily one of the sexiest things
that I've ever--

774
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,300
Shawn...

775
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,600
Shh.

776
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,600
Okay.

777
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,100
How could something so ugly happen here?

778
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,400
Just doesn't make any sense.

779
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,900
Last looks, Gus.

780
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,400
It'll be a cold day in hell before we--

781
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,100
I'm sorry i ditched you and made a pinata
with Jason cunningham.

782
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,600
Apology accepted.
