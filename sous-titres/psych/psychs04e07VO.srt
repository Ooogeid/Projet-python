1
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,853
Dad, can I please
get a home computer?

2
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:18,434
Mrs. Phillips said it would help
prepare me for the future.

3
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:21,689
Get your head out of the clouds.
Those things are another passing fad

4
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:24,774
like rap music, Madonna,
and <i>L.A. Law</i>. Here.

5
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:28,277
Why don't you focus on something
that might make you some money one day.

6
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:29,945
All right?

7
00:01:39,248 --> 00:01:40,850
I didn't see anything.
I swear.

8
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:42,560
Please...

9
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:43,728
don't shoot me.

10
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:44,938
Don't worry.

11
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:47,372
We're not gonna shoot you.

13
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,069
How do you not have a black suit?
What grown man doesn't own a black suit?

14
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:12,880
Besides me, the joker, colonel Sanders,
Matthew McConaughey?

15
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:14,755
He doesn't count.
He doesn't own a shirt.

16
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,231
- He doesn't need a shirt.
- You know that's right.

17
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:18,962
Sit down.

18
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:27,073
- So that's them, huh?
- Yes, unfortunately.

19
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:29,882
Come on, man, it's been ten years.
Can't you guys just hug it out?

20
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:33,635
And for the last time, I'm here
to say one final good-bye to Leonard.

21
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,311
He was a good friend.
And then that's it... we're out.

22
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,370
Thanks for coming.

23
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:39,992
Dearly beloved,

24
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:42,109
we gather here today not to...

25
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:43,913
mourn a death,

26
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:45,755
but to celebrate...

27
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:47,458
a life.

28
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:50,438
Can I give an amen
if the preacher guy asks for it?

29
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:52,172
Of course.
But wait for it.

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,801
Leonard Callahan, or "Diddle", as he was
known to those closest to him...

31
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:59,266
- Diddle?
- We all had nicknames, Shawn.

32
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:01,458
... was tragically taken from us

33
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:03,098
by a hit-and-run driver.

34
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,850
But we know...

35
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,644
Diddle is in a better place now.

36
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:09,553
Diddle is in a better place now.

37
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,373
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen!

38
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:14,485
And he continues to live

39
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:18,572
- in our hearts.
- Hallelujah!

40
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:21,344
- Sit down!
- Got caught up in the moment.

41
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:23,536
- I was in the moment.
- And now, in light of his...

42
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:25,898
home-going service,

43
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:29,166
Leonard's former bandmates
from college

44
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:33,087
would like to dedicate a special song
to his memory.

45
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:35,934
He was in a band.
That's cool.

46
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,218
- What are you doing?
- To pay my respects. Be quiet.

47
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:41,041
Get back here!

48
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,103
I can't believe you've been
holding out on me for all these years.

49
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:16,940
It's one of my lifelong dreams
to be part of a 4-piece singing group.

50
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:18,501
Five-piece was my backup.

51
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:21,315
Now I find out not only were you in one,
you let it all slip away...

52
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,280
- I must know why, I must!
- Enough, Shawn.

53
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,003
That was like a new edition
reunion concert minus Bobby and Ronnie.

54
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:30,704
What could have come between men
capable of creating such sweet harmony?

55
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:33,754
Gimme a hint.

56
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,626
You can give me a baby hint.

57
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:38,696
All right, fine.

58
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,416
I wish I could have known you
when you were black.

59
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:46,887
You're the psychic.

60
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:49,765
Yes. Uh, Shawn Spencer.

61
00:05:49,946 --> 00:05:50,946
I'm Tony.

62
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:52,223
This is Joon.

63
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:56,021
We read about yours and Gus's detective
agency in our alumni newsletter.

64
00:05:57,718 --> 00:06:00,401
Look, I gotta tell you guys,
you sounded amazing up there.

65
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,611
- I do a little singing myself.
- Yeah, thanks.

66
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,452
Diddle was the heart and soul
of our group.

67
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:08,075
The day he was taken from us
was the day the music died.

68
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,746
I just keep thinking
he can't be dead... He can't be!

69
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:16,246
And then I look at that casket
and I'm like...

70
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:17,793
That's gotta be Diddle in there.

71
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:21,078
Because why would they put his picture
on another dude's coffin?

72
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:22,923
And that's when I lose it!

73
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:25,634
So... tragic.

74
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:27,705
Look, man...

75
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,389
We don't think that Diddle
died in any bicycle accident.

76
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:34,226
I mean, he was the only brother I knew
who rode a bicycle as a grown man.

77
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:35,936
We think he was murdered.

78
00:06:39,785 --> 00:06:42,067
- Have you notified the police?
- What if they did it?

79
00:06:42,374 --> 00:06:44,823
Normally...
We wouldn't even associate ourselves

80
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:47,147
with somebody who would partner up
with a buster like Gus.

81
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:49,640
- Buster!
- But I checked out that newsletter,

82
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:51,498
and it seem like you are pretty good

83
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:53,412
at solving stuff
without a lot of evidence.

84
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,456
- The less evidence, the better.
- Good.

85
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,652
'Cause Diddle doesn't deserve
to go out like that.

86
00:06:57,777 --> 00:06:58,776
Not him.

87
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:01,503
I mean, the man was barely 5'10"
and could dunk with two hands!

88
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:05,428
- There I go again.
- It's okay, it's all right.

89
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,051
Can we hire you?

90
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,419
You know, man, I think
that might be a little complicated.

91
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,343
Then again...

92
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,396
What are best friends of mysteriously
estranged old college pals for?

93
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,736
Psych 407
"High Top Fade Out"

94
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,604
Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

95
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:21,458
G-whiz.

96
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:23,121
- Joon.
- Sweet!

97
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:26,247
Now that that's out of the way, let's go
ahead and bring Gus up to speed.

98
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,301
Fine.

99
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:29,883
It all started
when we got this weird email

100
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,119
from Diddle on the day that he died.

101
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,598
- "It's so hard to say good-bye."
- There's a huge file attached to it.

102
00:08:37,374 --> 00:08:39,247
It's not like any file
I've ever seen.

103
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:41,687
And it's heavily encrypted.
It can't be opened.

104
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,786
We can't figure out
what the message means,

105
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:45,732
but it has something
to do with him dying.

106
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,361
You're listed as a recipient here.
Do you remember getting this email?

107
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,698
I got it, and I immediately proceeded
to place it into the trash bin.

108
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,242
That's cold, B.

109
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:58,035
Yo, that's like Beyonce
and the first destiny's child cold.

110
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,212
Me and Diddles' relationship
was rock solid.

111
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:01,646
We never lost contact.

112
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:04,459
But he would send us these emails
about getting the group back together,

113
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,420
which involve reconciling
with these jokers,

114
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,755
- and that was not gonna happen.
- Not happenin'.

115
00:09:09,004 --> 00:09:11,216
Not even if Jesus was our manager.

116
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,747
You're not serious about that.

117
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:15,929
- No, I ain't serious. I was... playin'.
- All right.

118
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,869
Then it's settled.
There'll be no reunion

119
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:20,016
unless Jesus agrees
to manage the group.

120
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,110
That's fine by me.

121
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:31,069
<i>If Jesus</i>

122
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:34,406
<i>was our manager</i>

123
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,270
<i>he would bring us</i>

124
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:41,455
<i>all together</i>

125
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,257
We aren't gonna sing
our problems away.

126
00:09:44,441 --> 00:09:45,935
Look, you guys,

127
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,661
whatever happened between you,
it happened a long time ago.

128
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:52,007
You've clearly suffered a great loss.
Look at the bright side.

129
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,279
You've the opportunity
to make Diddles' wish come true.

130
00:09:54,404 --> 00:09:57,570
Yeah, but look at the dark side. Being
together makes a bad situation worse.

131
00:09:57,695 --> 00:10:00,348
Look on the dark side?
Who talks like that?

132
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:01,934
The most negative dude I know.

133
00:10:02,257 --> 00:10:04,895
Okay, guys, let's just...
Let's get the email up

134
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,458
and we'll see what's what.

135
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:09,900
Call me negative.
He's been doing that all these years.

136
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:13,362
- I read the purpose driven life!
- Man, transformation equals change.

137
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,875
- It's encrypted, all right.
- Well, de-cryptify it.

138
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,411
You can't just un-encrypt something.

139
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,126
You need a data key,
a pass code, a complex algorithm.

140
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:26,540
Whatever this file is,
he went out of his way to protect it.

141
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,952
- Diddle worked for Cybervault.
- I know.

142
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,713
- Diddle worked for Cybervault.
- This dude...

143
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,602
Companies hire them to protect
and encrypt data sent over networks.

144
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:37,461
So they can or cannot lift
the parental lock on my laptop?

145
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,513
That was me.
It was for your own good.

146
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,340
They protect
credit card transactions,

147
00:10:41,465 --> 00:10:44,004
trade secrets,
classified government documents.

148
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:46,478
Those guys are running
some big brother-type stuff over there.

149
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,120
We think Diddle maybe stumbled across
some secret information

150
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:50,982
somebody was trying
to get their hands on.

151
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:53,443
Now you feel where we're comin' from.
How'bout you, Gus?

152
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,488
Oh, man. He's not even hearing it,
much less feelin' it.

153
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,524
It's clear to the 3 of us that you're
neither hearing it nor feeling it.

154
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,701
What I can't discern is
are you mad at it?

155
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:05,106
All right.

156
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,374
We need to retrace
Diddles' final steps.

157
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:11,795
Diddles' time of death was pegged
right after he sent the email.

158
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:15,257
- So he had just left the apartment.
- Brilliant! We'll start there.

159
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,149
We're helping the family collect
his things so we can gain full access.

160
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,602
No, he didn't keep these.

161
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:33,358
What?

162
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:36,289
Let me see, let me see.

163
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,836
- Mine still fits!
- Mine does too.

164
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:46,997
Like yesterday.
Let's do the steps.

165
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:49,193
All right.

166
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:02,720
Mine smells like mothballs.

167
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,091
- Yeah, mine smells like mold.
- Like my grandmama feet.

168
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:13,150
- You think I could have Diddles'?
- No. Let's get back to work.

169
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:17,277
Let me ask you something.
Was he always this safety-conscious?

170
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:20,989
Once in college, he left his seatbelt
on during a drive-in movie.

171
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,368
He's not the guy that would go cycling
without his protective cycling gear.

172
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:25,701
Good point.

173
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:27,120
Check that out.

174
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:30,082
Who uses a power strip for one plug?

175
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,044
I'm sensing that some
of Diddles' computer equipment

176
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,838
has been stolen and that there is more
going on here than meets the eye.

177
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,053
Hi, Jules.
Hi, old penguin from <i>Happy feet</i>.

178
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:45,817
- What do you got?
- I'm so sorry to hear

179
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:48,808
that Leonard is a friend of yours, Gus,
but we looked at it again,

180
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,887
and we agree
with the initial assessment.

181
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,940
Even though it was a grisly accident,
it is a straightforward hit and run.

182
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:56,900
That's it?
Can we look into it?

183
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:59,486
I'm afraid not. City's cutting down
on wasteful spending.

184
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:02,418
That includes
all non-essential expenditures.

185
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:05,784
And we already have a team on that,
so no need for a psychic consultation.

186
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,152
Anything else?

187
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:09,998
Did Lassiter throw his voice
into your mouth?

188
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,915
Because that's really unsanitary.

189
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,399
That's nice work.

190
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:16,711
Shoo, flies.

191
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,923
If I could just get a psychic reading
on the autopsy report...

192
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,829
Gosh, I'm sorry, see that would
require one meeting with the new coroner

193
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:26,725
which requires an official police detail
which one does not have because...

194
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,550
one is not welcome here.

195
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,309
Shoo.

196
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,370
And we're shooing.

197
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,893
We're shooing.
We're shooing.

198
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:36,318
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

199
00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:38,794
Sweet.

200
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,437
You heard Lassiter.
We need a police detail.

201
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:44,204
Don't be the American adaptation
of the British Gus.

202
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,576
- I'm not impersonating a coroner.
- Fine. You're on your own then.

203
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,753
It's the one without any teeth.

204
00:13:51,273 --> 00:13:53,582
Tell me what to do!
My knees and calves are locking up!

205
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:56,334
- You must be out of your damn mind!
- Do it for Diddle.

206
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,002
- I get claustrophobic.
- You're a cadaver.

207
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:09,188
Cover you because cadavers don't wear
shirts from Abercrombie and fletch.

208
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:11,892
It's Abercrombie and Fitch.
And, no, you haven't heard it both ways!

209
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,214
- Hey there.
- Hi.

210
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,865
- You must be the new coroner.
- I just transferred over.

211
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,776
But don't worry, I've been playing
with dead things since I was a toddler.

212
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,004
I'm Shawn Spencer.

213
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:26,323
This dead body here
is detective Miles.

214
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:29,409
- Another one of the good guys, huh?
- No, sir. His first name is detective.

215
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:32,747
Of course. Well, leave him right there
while I prepare a toe tag.

216
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,922
You got it.

217
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:37,792
You know, an emt buddy of mine
said he brought in

218
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:41,008
a hit and run victim the other day.
Nasty stuff, huh?

219
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:42,931
I worked that specimen.
It was pretty bad

220
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,327
but consistent
with an automobile/cycling collision...

221
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,490
Multiple cranial fractures,
crushed larynx,

222
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:49,941
fractured hyoid bone,
contusions this,

223
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,709
blunt force trauma that.

224
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:53,767
Stupid government pens.
I'll be right back.

225
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:00,489
A crushed larynx and broken hyoid could
also be consistent with asphyxiation.

226
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,485
- Did you say a token hemorrhoid?
- I said broken hyoid...

227
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:07,577
Yeah, you know what?
That's pretty much what he said.

228
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:09,949
Then he went on
to say something pretty crazy.

229
00:15:10,832 --> 00:15:13,036
That the crushed larynx and hyoid

230
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:15,330
could have meant
that he was asphyxiated.

231
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:17,668
Asphyxiation?

232
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:20,710
- That wouldn't make any sense.
- That's what I said.

233
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,415
Unless this crash...

234
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,520
was postmortem.

235
00:15:26,484 --> 00:15:27,884
That was my Caruso.

236
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,011
Not bad, right?

237
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:32,152
Oh, man!

238
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:34,201
I'm gonna need another release form.

239
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:36,768
I filled this out in farsi
by mistake.

240
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,604
I've been using the rosetta stone
to learn new languages in my down time.

241
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,525
That computer software
really works, huh?

242
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,650
Wait a second.

243
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,984
There's software called
the rosetta stone too?

244
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:49,614
- You got me! Touche!
- Revenge!

245
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,702
I've got some more release forms
in the back, you boob!

246
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:56,903
Dude, did you hear that?

247
00:15:57,028 --> 00:15:58,847
He said someone could have
used the accident

248
00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:02,419
to cover up the way that Diddle died.
They were right. This was murder!

249
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,129
Is the guy still here?

250
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,267
He's in the back.
I really didn't mind him though.

251
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,758
Yeah. He's a real character.
Can we get outta here?

252
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:16,627
Poor Diddle. They probably threatened
to torture him first

253
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:18,137
then tortured him second.

254
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:21,211
Then they threatened to kill him third.
Then they killed him fourth.

255
00:16:21,336 --> 00:16:23,940
Stop making up conspiracy theories.
You don't know if they tortured him.

256
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,791
I do know,
because that's what they do.

257
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,193
- Who is "they"?
- "Them".

258
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,488
He should've just played dead.
I always say

259
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,493
that's what I would do if somebody
was trying to kill me... Just play dead.

260
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,600
I mean, they'd be like...
"we're gonna kill you!"

261
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:37,293
And then I'd be like... dead.

262
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:39,977
Then they'd be like, "He's dead.
Let's go kill somebody else."

263
00:16:40,102 --> 00:16:43,288
- And then they would leave.
- Guys, I'm afraid I have more bad news.

264
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:45,378
Whoever they are, they might know

265
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,441
that Diddle emailed
the 3 of you the file.

266
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:49,924
You guys could be
in some serious danger.

267
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,414
- I didn't get any email.
- What?

268
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:54,721
- We all got the email.
- Y'all got it... I didn't.

269
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,681
You can't pretend
you're not a part of this.

270
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,725
- I don't even have a computer.
- You do too!

271
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:01,936
- I didn't get the email either then.
- You would even sell out each other.

272
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,823
Don't talk to me, crazy.
I didn't get it.

273
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:05,148
Let's get outta here.

274
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,895
My mama bought me that car!

275
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,706
I'm not with you!

276
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:29,642
- Okay, here's the deal.
- Now do you believe there's a case?

277
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:32,092
We need to see if the bomb squad
has any evidence we can trace

278
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,303
- like residue, fragments, detonators...
- Slow down.

279
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,694
Nobody said anything
about you being put on this case.

280
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:39,244
It's not that simple anymore.
We're under direct orders from Vick.

281
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:41,092
Now, clearly, something's going on,

282
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:43,932
but the top brass has instituted
a whole new layer of protocol.

283
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:47,393
The first thing we need to do is run
full background checks on your pals,

284
00:17:47,518 --> 00:17:49,317
make sure all
doesn't start with them.

285
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,747
- You are kidding, right?
- No, I'm not, Guster.

286
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:54,906
Your attitude confirms that this case
presents a conflict of interest for you,

287
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:57,158
which is precisely
why you won't be getting involved.

288
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,943
- What do we do in the meantime?
- Just sit tight.

289
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:01,571
And take the bus.

290
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,060
What?

291
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,626
Too soon?

292
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:13,336
All right, Jules,

293
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:17,262
I'm now entering
our cone of confidentiality.

294
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,264
Get to the point.
I'm really busy.

295
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,206
Let's be honest with each other.

296
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:23,820
This is you paying me back
for the awkwardness

297
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:26,146
and tension that I've allowed Abigail
to cause between us.

298
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,583
Contrary to what you may think, Shawn,
it isn't always about you.

299
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,689
When I open an investigation,
I have to answer to people in authority

300
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:34,028
above me.

301
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:35,697
I understand.

302
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:38,129
Especially if,
by contrary to what I believe,

303
00:18:38,254 --> 00:18:40,764
it isn't always about me,
and when you open an investigation

304
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:43,788
you have to answer to people
in authority above you, you mean

305
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:45,123
it's because of Abigail.

306
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,793
I'm supposed to giggle, because
your charm is just too irresistible?

307
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,781
Almost.

308
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:52,476
I was gonna bring it home
doing both sides of the conversation

309
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:55,049
using my high-pitched
eighth grade Jules voice.

310
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,008
I'm sure
that your girlfriend appreciates

311
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:59,345
you using her as a tactic
to scam information.

312
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,056
Gold star, Shawn.
Really.

313
00:19:06,302 --> 00:19:07,103
Well?

314
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:08,780
Crashed and burned.

315
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:12,484
Then somehow crashed again in Chile,
only to be eaten by my soccer teammates.

316
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:14,845
We're on our own.
That much is clear.

317
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,759
We'll stash Tony and Joon
at my dad's place.

318
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:18,521
That way we can focus on the case.

319
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:20,721
We need to figure out
what was on that encrypted file.

320
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,408
It was way too complicated
for any normal person to crack.

321
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,498
Then we'll find someplace
with people just as smart as Diddle

322
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:29,125
like a chemistry lab or...

323
00:19:29,473 --> 00:19:31,376
- Cybervault?
- What?

324
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:34,129
Bringing your good stuff today, man.

325
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,360
I'll figure out the processing power

326
00:19:57,485 --> 00:19:59,823
we'll need to run our localized servers
and report it to I.T.

327
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:02,167
- Better yet, you do it.
- Copy.

328
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:04,229
And what about the open source
coding seminar?

329
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:06,253
I know it's important.
I don't have the time.

330
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:08,237
Here's an idea.
I'll do it.

331
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:14,133
Let me take the lead on this one.
You're way out of your element here.

332
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:15,547
Make it quick.

333
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:19,209
Thank you for taking the time to speak
with us, sir. My name is Gus... Brown,

334
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,594
and this is my associate
Shawn White.

335
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,471
We're friends of Leonard Callahan,

336
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,808
and we're wondering if someone could
help us with one of his encrypted files.

337
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:29,811
I doubt it. Leonard was the best we had.
No one could break his encryptions.

338
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:31,479
He even had patents on them.

339
00:20:32,924 --> 00:20:34,413
I can't even figure out...

340
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:37,068
what he was working on
before he died.

341
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,982
I don't suppose either of you can create
an 802.1q spanning tree loop

342
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,241
using auto forwarding
non-wintel based equipment?

343
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,326
I can make a straw wrapper crawl
like a worm.

344
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:48,668
And...

345
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:51,356
make the inside of my elbow
look like a butt.

346
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,759
- Thank you for your time.
- See?

347
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,991
Dude, it's Diddle's cubicle.

348
00:21:00,304 --> 00:21:02,805
Maybe there's a clue there
about what was on that encrypted file.

349
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,030
That's just what I was thinking.

350
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:11,519
This guy's almost as organized
as you are.

351
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,230
Those  brothers, they couldn't color-tab
their way out of the staples.

352
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,108
You're on them cause
they're not anal-retentive enough?

353
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,180
- What happened between you?
- Move on.

354
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,825
Dude, I've always wanted to do this.

355
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:40,689
Look what I just did.
I'm like Mr. Wizard.

356
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:43,176
I wonder what was so important

357
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,938
about those addresses.

358
00:21:54,372 --> 00:21:56,189
- That's interesting.
- What?

359
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:09,619
Your boy liked big butts,
and I cannot lie.

360
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:10,703
What?

361
00:22:10,886 --> 00:22:13,163
Looks like Diddle
had a little stalker in him.

362
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:15,959
Diddle was a saint, Shawn.
Don't talk about him like that.

363
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:20,463
I'm not mad at him.

364
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,264
Excuse us.
We were never formally introduced.

365
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,842
I'm world-renowned
psychic/lothario Shawn Spencer.

366
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:32,517
- This is my associate...
- Gus.

367
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,226
But you can call me John Slade.

368
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:35,603
I'm Chelsea.

369
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:39,482
I'm getting a psychic transmission
right here as we speak, Chelsea.

370
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:41,693
A fleeting glance

371
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,061
a stolen moment between coworkers.

372
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:46,364
Leonard had a little thing for you.

373
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,158
- How'd you know that?
- Psych... psychic... I'm...

374
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,707
I could always tell, the way he'd...

375
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:54,539
hold the door for me
or offer to help carry my files.

376
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:58,233
He finally got up the nerve
to ask me out right before he...

377
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,170
He was very sweet.

378
00:23:01,568 --> 00:23:03,630
You don't meet many guys
like that these days.

379
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,676
There, there.
I know how you feel.

380
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,805
Do you recall anything unusual
about his final days?

381
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,507
We just started talking.

382
00:23:12,632 --> 00:23:15,311
I never...
got to know him all that well.

383
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:19,655
He sure loved his music, though.
Always humming

384
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,816
or riffing on songs
over there in his cubicle.

385
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:25,194
Talking about some group
he used to sing with back in college.

386
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,320
Blackapella.

387
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,252
I was a part of that group, but...

388
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,910
Anyway.

389
00:23:31,296 --> 00:23:32,994
If you can think of anything else

390
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:35,580
or if you just need someone
to talk to, please...

391
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:37,330
Feel free to give us a call.

392
00:23:37,576 --> 00:23:40,501
This is my work card, but my personal
cell number's on the back.

393
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:43,139
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chelsea.

394
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:45,149
All right.

395
00:23:45,352 --> 00:23:48,032
Dude,
you realize that's the third variation

396
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:50,927
of "my work card with my some other
number on the back in pencil" move

397
00:23:51,052 --> 00:23:52,547
that you've used this month alone?

398
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:55,296
It's called showing off
my penmanship, Shawn.

399
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:57,769
Ancient culture saw it
as a sign of virility.

400
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:08,125
- Shut up.
- It hurts.

401
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,033
Dad.

402
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:11,455
We left them here to keep them safe.

403
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,698
- Who did this?
- They did. Damn fools shot themselves.

404
00:24:13,823 --> 00:24:15,661
Who the hell left them
with a BB gun?

405
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,603
I did.

406
00:24:17,295 --> 00:24:19,791
They said they wanted to be able
to defend themselves.

407
00:24:20,122 --> 00:24:21,122
Dumb move.

408
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:26,255
Calm down. The BB bounced off you.
It's like you're made of rubber.

409
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:30,033
I thought you two were wusses.
You're commandoes compared to them.

410
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:33,423
Please tell me you're onto something,
'cause our lives may depend on it.

411
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:35,636
- You can say that again.
- Don't you worry.

412
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:38,434
My meta-ethereal game
is as tight as Gus's workout shorts.

413
00:24:39,152 --> 00:24:42,855
Checking some addresses here
that are psychically linked to Diddle.

414
00:24:43,344 --> 00:24:44,065
<i>Hello.</i>

415
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:45,823
<i>Hello.</i>

416
00:24:47,784 --> 00:24:49,484
Yes. This is John Slade.

417
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,906
Hey, Chelsea.
How you doing?

418
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:55,286
No. I'm glad you called.

419
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,036
Drinks later?

420
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:58,405
Okay, sure.

421
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,170
All right.

422
00:25:01,976 --> 00:25:03,619
Who the hell is John Slade?

423
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,547
Hell, no, B.

424
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,465
I know you not using Diddle's death
to get some play with that shorty.

425
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:12,176
All I did was give her my number
in case she need to talk.

426
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,314
Let me guess.

427
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:16,639
Did you write it out for her
so she could see your good penmanship?

428
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,314
- I taught you that move, B.
- Say it ain't so, B.

429
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,978
- Who the hell is B?
- Everyone but you.

430
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:25,064
Gus will always sell out his boys
for some woman.

431
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:27,549
- Amen to that.
- What?

432
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,362
Last week, you left me at a Coco's
to help a chick to move a table.

433
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,698
Sister had green eyes.
That's a special circumstance.

434
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,659
Doesn't surprise me.
Gus has never honored the code.

435
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:39,287
- So you wanna go there?
- We can go there.

436
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,663
- You sure?
- We can.

437
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,666
- You wanna bring up the past.
- Absolutely.

438
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,918
It hasn't really been
long enough, okay?

439
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:48,443
It still kinda cuts deep
like a machete in the bush.

440
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:51,424
I'm the one that should be hurt.
You two slept with my girlfriend.

441
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,510
- She wasn't your girlfriend.
- She was a groupie!

442
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,596
An a cappella groupie?
That exists?

443
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,124
It was college, B.
We had the matching jackets...

444
00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:01,473
And free biscuits and gravy
after every show.

445
00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:03,517
It doesn't matter
what you two saw her as.

446
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:05,938
I was way into her and she was into me,
and you knew that.

447
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:09,108
You don't fall in love with a groupie.
That's part of the code!

448
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:10,763
Even Patrick Fugit knows that.

449
00:26:10,888 --> 00:26:13,529
You don't sleep with your mate's girl.
That's the code!

450
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:16,908
I thought the code was about not having
a fling with your best friend's sister.

451
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,118
Wait a minute.
You hooked up with Joy?

452
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,329
- My hero!
- Gimme some.

453
00:26:21,634 --> 00:26:24,081
- Stop it, Shawn.
- No, you stop it, G-Whiz.

454
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,167
You broke up Blackapella, man.

455
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,585
We were going places!

456
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,546
The whole world was our oyster, man.
Everybody loved us.

457
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,549
Did you see that video at the funeral?
We looked like idiots.

458
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:36,343
Those were hammer pants.
Five years behind the curve.

459
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,179
It wasn't about that.

460
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:41,599
We played shows at the student center
and the Cinnamon Festival, that's it.

461
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,644
It was about college and friendship
and having the best times of our lives.

462
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,104
And you betrayed me.
The both of you.

463
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:51,067
Got your minds mixed up in nonsense,
and it broke my heart!

464
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,536
We're all over this case, okay?

465
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,440
We're gonna check out these addresses,
and we will report back what we find.

466
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:07,416
In the meantime, you two stay put.

467
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,874
Diddle was here
the night that he died.

468
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:43,369
That's messed up.

469
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:44,837
What the...

470
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:47,123
I specifically told you guys
to stay at my dad's.

471
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:48,709
But then you gave us the nod.

472
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,877
So clearly you were saying, don't trust
something this important to Gus, B.

473
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:55,868
No. I'm not nearly adept enough
at using "B" to work it into a nod.

474
00:27:55,993 --> 00:27:57,800
I was saying, "good-bye for now."

475
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:00,045
I told you not to mess with the nod.

476
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,935
Never.
You've never once said that to me.

477
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,568
Bottom line...
If you want this case to get solved,

478
00:28:04,693 --> 00:28:07,590
you have to trust us,
and you have to stay away.

479
00:28:07,715 --> 00:28:09,353
You're targets, remember?

480
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:11,405
- All right.
- Bet.

481
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:14,984
We're gonna check this out.
You go back to my dad's and stay put.

482
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,029
We'll check in with you later.

483
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,591
We'll wait five minutes and then
follow them inside with the BB guns.

484
00:28:23,716 --> 00:28:25,316
You know that's right.

485
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:37,493
It looks like this party's over.

486
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:40,156
It actually looks suspiciously
like Steve Martin's office

487
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:41,761
in <i>The Spanish Prisoner</i>.

488
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:42,743
Help!

489
00:28:43,376 --> 00:28:44,191
Help!

490
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:49,393
They got Tony and Joon!

491
00:29:04,469 --> 00:29:07,328
- Tell me you have a plan.
- Sit down. We'll be doing the talking.

492
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,109
Two of my friends are missing,
and I'm next on the list.

493
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:12,291
- I'm entitled to...
- You're entitled to nothing.

494
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,337
And as far as your friends go,
you've got yourself to blame for them.

495
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:18,272
You must be out of your damn mind.


496
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:19,673
Enough, both of you.

497
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:24,320
Gus, I know this must be difficult,
but Lassiter is right...

498
00:29:24,445 --> 00:29:26,680
Your friends had no business
being near that warehouse.

499
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:29,129
They followed us.
What were we supposed to do?

500
00:29:29,254 --> 00:29:32,103
We tried to stash them at my dad's.
They bolted while he was on the throne.

501
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,980
We told you there was something rotten
in Sweden, but you wouldn't listen.

502
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,024
I am ordering you two to lay low
and stay out of our way.

503
00:29:38,705 --> 00:29:41,135
We will call you
when we find your friends.

504
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,792
And Shawn, if you are feeling anything,
you better tell us right now.

505
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,684
Really?
Would that be useful?

506
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:49,511
I'm gonna put my energy
into making sure that my best friend

507
00:29:49,636 --> 00:29:52,774
isn't the next domino to fall,
since that's the least of your concerns.

508
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:54,583
- We just...
- Just nothing.

509
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,044
Time is wasting.
Let's go, O'Hara.

510
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,814
Come on.

511
00:29:59,286 --> 00:30:01,549
I know what'll make you feel better.

512
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:07,616
- Feel better?
- A little.

513
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:10,379
I never wanted to punch Lassiter 
before today.

514
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:13,285
- Really?
- The worst part is that he's right.

515
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,980
Tony and Joon are not detectives.
They had no business being there.

516
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:17,857
They're grown men with free will.

517
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:21,350
There's so many things left unsaid.
All those years of radio silence...

518
00:30:21,475 --> 00:30:23,529
I wish I had a chance
to tell them how I truly felt.

519
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,407
You have had countless opportunities
in the last 48 hours alone.

520
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:27,979
You know what?

521
00:30:28,104 --> 00:30:30,933
You should have sang that song
you came up with for our high school.

522
00:30:31,058 --> 00:30:33,247
Same one you sang for the principal
in the bathroom.

523
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,124
That's fromlean on me,
and you know it.

524
00:30:35,606 --> 00:30:37,207
Don't act like you really care.

525
00:30:37,332 --> 00:30:40,671
The reason why you took this case is
because you wanted to sing in our group.

526
00:30:42,852 --> 00:30:44,252
All right, look...

527
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:48,429
I'll admit the thought
may have crossed my mind very briefly.

528
00:30:50,364 --> 00:30:51,514
The truth is,

529
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:53,773
I took this case
because I got freaked

530
00:30:53,898 --> 00:30:56,832
that you could have a falling out
with dudes that used to be so close.

531
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:59,355
If it could happen to you,
then it could happen to us.

532
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:02,970
Don't you realize that none
of the myriad of stupid, selfish,

533
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:05,948
and ultimately life-threatening stunts
you pulled over the years could do it?

534
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,490
It's probably not gonna happen.

535
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,579
So what do you wanna do?
We should probably hide you somewhere.

536
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:18,985
What would we do if we were still
on the case and looking for them?

537
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,651
Whatever Diddle was tracking,

538
00:31:20,776 --> 00:31:23,942
the second warehouse on his list
is probably next, so...

539
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:27,010
we throw caution to the wind,
dress up like american ninjas,

540
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,227
and check it out.

541
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:44,944
- I don't wanna get shot, Shawn.
- Just stay low. You'll be the lookout.

542
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:47,386
Good 'cause I can look out
from outside.

543
00:31:47,511 --> 00:31:48,711
Get back here!

544
00:31:53,475 --> 00:31:54,370
That's weird.

545
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:56,446
What? What is it?

546
00:31:56,864 --> 00:31:58,958
There's one hair on my knuckle
that's like...

547
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,626
twice as long as all the other ones.

548
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:02,169
What do you see, Shawn?

549
00:32:04,937 --> 00:32:05,695
Dude.

550
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:09,260
It's some sort of secret deal.
With briefcases.

551
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:10,979
It looks super-shady.

552
00:32:11,104 --> 00:32:13,237
How did Diddle get himself
mixed up in all of that?

553
00:32:13,362 --> 00:32:16,064
He was the smartest,
most responsible brother in our group.

554
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:19,803
It's drugs.

555
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,147
This is all about drugs?

556
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:25,084
The weird guy from the funeral
is here!

557
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:28,145
- What is Reverend Watkins doing here?
- It's not Reverend Watkins!

558
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,148
- Who is it?
- The weird guy with the scar.

559
00:32:30,273 --> 00:32:32,073
He left early, I told you.

560
00:32:33,394 --> 00:32:34,660
That's a lotta dough.

561
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:36,996
This is straight out
of <i>To Live and Die in L.A.</i>

562
00:32:37,464 --> 00:32:40,416
They put their pinky in the blow
and taste it to see if it's good?

563
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,167
He just did. It's good.

564
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:45,963
It's really good.
Dude, he double-dipped.

565
00:32:46,347 --> 00:32:49,145
- That's unsanitary!
- Not if it's for his personal stash.

566
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,176
- We don't know.
- Do you see Tony and Joon?

567
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,819
Don't come up!
There's not room for you up here!

568
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,973
They're not here.

569
00:32:56,526 --> 00:32:58,707
But I bet one of these b-holes
can lead us right to them.

570
00:32:58,832 --> 00:33:00,638
I say we go back to the car,

571
00:33:00,763 --> 00:33:03,063
wait, and then
follow the guy with the scar.

572
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:06,066
- That rhymed.
- <i>Hello</i>.

573
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:08,569
What are you doing?
He heard that!

574
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,802
- It's my phone!
- Turn it off.

575
00:33:10,927 --> 00:33:13,198
- I'm trying to.
- Who could be calling you at this...

576
00:33:13,804 --> 00:33:14,756
You are!

577
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:17,370
I tell you about putting your phone
in your back pocket.

578
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,787
That's ridiculous!

579
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,782
It is me. It is me.

580
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,628
Who are you?

581
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,507
You move, and I paint this wall
with your brain matter.

582
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:34,094
Now, who the hell sent you?

583
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:35,804
You wouldn't believe us.

584
00:33:36,754 --> 00:33:37,556
Try me.

585
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,410
Mikhail...

586
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:44,021
- Dudikoff.
- Russian mob?

587
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,520
American ninjas.

588
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,024
<i>Hello.</i>

589
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:12,999
Get in the car!

590
00:34:18,832 --> 00:34:20,793
I don't wanna get tortured, Shawn.

591
00:34:27,187 --> 00:34:28,187
Shut up!

592
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:32,204
You two have managed to stumble
into the biggest undercover operation

593
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:34,780
- in this department's history!
- Where are Tony and Joon?

594
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,495
Tony and Joon are safe and sound
in the room right next door.

595
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:44,862
Joon is on his third doughnut.

596
00:34:44,987 --> 00:34:48,210
This is detective Moses Johnson
from narcotics.

597
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,853
He's our inside man.

598
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:52,043
We simply couldn't risk
exposing him.

599
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,342
You two...

600
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:57,376
Sure have a propensity

601
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:59,221
for being in the wrong place

602
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,097
at the wrong time.

603
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:08,063
It's a refined skill.

604
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,288
Keeping track of you two
is getting sticky.

605
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:12,526
That's why we scooped up
your two friends.

606
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:13,688
Last night,

607
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:16,280
you literally landed
in the lion's den.

608
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,210
I'll be in the conference room.

609
00:35:21,513 --> 00:35:24,680
How... in the hell
could you not tell us about this?

610
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:27,488
- We are members of this team!
- We solve a murder a week.

611
00:35:27,613 --> 00:35:30,294
- Why did you leave us here all night?
- It was for your own protection.

612
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:33,292
What is all of this about,
and what did Diddle get himself into?

613
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:35,943
The SBPD uses undisclosed warehouses

614
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:38,761
to store the caches of drugs and weapons
they seize from busts.

615
00:35:39,018 --> 00:35:41,509
The street value on this contraband
is astronomical.

616
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:44,686
Somebody cracked our network system,
discovered these locations,

617
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,226
and stole the confiscated drugs.

618
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,730
Detective Johnson was undercover
as a drug lord trying to make a score.

619
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:52,524
<i>Diddle worked for Cybervault.</i>

620
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,167
<i>They protect credit card transactions,
trade secrets,</i>

621
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:56,945
<i>classified government documents.</i>

622
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:58,197
I can see it.

623
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,875
Sbpd contracts Cybervault
to do their network security.

624
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,577
It's probably their biggest account.

625
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,549
We didn't make the connection
until you came

626
00:36:05,674 --> 00:36:07,790
saying that your friend's death
wasn't an accident.

627
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:10,425
Diddle

628
00:36:10,695 --> 00:36:13,545
discovered a workaround
in his company's code...

629
00:36:14,287 --> 00:36:16,226
One that would allow
someone to access

630
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:19,301
any of their clients' protected
network communications.

631
00:36:19,738 --> 00:36:22,264
He tried to take it to his supervisor,
got blown off,

632
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,848
and then he went
and followed the evidence for himself.

633
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:28,227
Your buddy was one smart cookie.

634
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:30,187
He got close enough to the rat

635
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,497
to catch him making the deal
with the bad guy on video.

636
00:36:32,622 --> 00:36:34,566
Which is what we think
he attached to the email.

637
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,184
He also managed
to get himself killed.

638
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,182
Tony and Joon gave us the file.

639
00:36:39,307 --> 00:36:42,798
We've had one of our best techies
working on it with no luck as of yet.

640
00:36:42,923 --> 00:36:45,030
They've tried
every decryption algorithm.

641
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:46,592
I'm really sorry.

642
00:36:46,717 --> 00:36:48,789
Your friend Leonard really seemed
like a stand-up guy.

643
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,512
I can't believe this.

644
00:37:03,503 --> 00:37:06,598
- Man, it's good to see you too.
- Man, we thought we was dead for sure.

645
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,976
Tony started praying out loud
in the back of the car,

646
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:12,568
so then the scary <i>Sugar Hill</i> dude
was like, "shut the hell up back there!"

647
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:14,207
- Tell 'em what I said .
- Then...

648
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:17,526
I said, "man, don't you know
when it's time to keep your mouth shut?"

649
00:37:17,695 --> 00:37:20,404
You understand me?
I was thinking words in my head,

650
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,060
but I wasn't saying them.
See? In my mind, I was like...

651
00:37:23,185 --> 00:37:24,746
None of this would have happened

652
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:27,953
if we'd have got the group back together
like Diddle always wanted us to.

653
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:29,288
Right?

654
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,042
<i>He sure loved his music, though.</i>

655
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,415
So then when the bad dude
with the gun was like, "shut up!"

656
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,769
I was just like...

657
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,720
Because my mama taught me
from a very early age...

658
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:47,164
very early age...
I would say four, five, or six...

659
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:49,908
She was like,
"all you need in this world...

660
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:51,810
Basic morals, values, and respect."

661
00:37:52,522 --> 00:37:53,722
Joon, shut up!

662
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:58,025
<i>It's so hard to say good-bye</i>.
Diddle gave us everything we need.

663
00:37:58,629 --> 00:38:00,840
I gotta see the encryption on this file.
You guys...

664
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:02,465
Warm up your voices.

665
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:05,041
Follow me!

666
00:38:07,901 --> 00:38:09,684
- Not now, Spencer.
- No, I think I got it.

667
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:10,537
Right.

668
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:12,753
I've run every algorithm imaginable.

669
00:38:12,878 --> 00:38:15,563
There are four separate locks,
and I can't see a pattern anywhere.

670
00:38:15,688 --> 00:38:18,017
It's not what you can't see.
It's what you can't hear.

671
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:19,509
- May I?
- Be my guest.

672
00:38:19,634 --> 00:38:21,904
Fellas.
<i>It's so hard to say good-bye.</i>

673
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:24,051
Just like the old days,
minus the hair and satin.

674
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,148
It's working!

675
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,901
- The last strip?
- There were four of us. The harmony.

676
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,940
I got it! I'll do it.

677
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,411
That can't be.

678
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:10,389
Wait a second.

679
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,224
- That's the rat?
- Who is that?

680
00:39:13,258 --> 00:39:14,258
Let's go!

681
00:39:16,926 --> 00:39:17,751
Babies.

682
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,914
Chelsea Patterson.

683
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,001
You're under arrest.

684
00:39:39,997 --> 00:39:41,251
What is this...

685
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,630
- John Slade?
- It's the end of the road.

686
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,882
Leonard discovered
the leak in your security code

687
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:49,618
and reported it to your supervisor
who, as always, passed it off to you.

688
00:39:49,743 --> 00:39:50,595
<i>Copy.</i>

689
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,097
Unlike my friend,

690
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:55,247
you didn't do the noble thing
and decided to try and get yours.

691
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:02,669
You used the leak to acquire
the locations of the SBPD warehouses

692
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,861
and then sold that information
to a drug kingpin.

693
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:08,658
Diddle caught it all on camera.

694
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,182
He wasn't creepily
checking out your posterior.

695
00:40:13,307 --> 00:40:15,454
- That's not creepy at all.
- He was investigating you.

696
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,586
You felt horrible
that your dealings led to his death,

697
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:20,568
but by then the damage
was already done.

698
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:24,546
Because of you, those same drug dealers
went after Gus, Tony, and Joon.

699
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:26,173
I'm officially canceling drinks.

700
00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:30,427
- Probably.
- Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

701
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:33,388
Least of all Leonard.
I'm sorry.

702
00:40:34,002 --> 00:40:36,016
You'll have plenty of time
to think about that.

703
00:40:36,683 --> 00:40:38,974
In fact, we might be able
to cut into some of that

704
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:42,564
if you were to name some names
and lead us to your associates.

705
00:40:43,438 --> 00:40:44,626
Do it for Diddle.

706
00:40:49,649 --> 00:40:50,906
Nice work, guys.

707
00:40:51,717 --> 00:40:53,617
- No thanks to you.
- Especially you.

708
00:40:54,303 --> 00:40:57,996
I can't believe you didn't let us in.
I thought we were on the same team.

709
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:01,416
You are not a cop, Spencer.
You never will be.

710
00:41:06,903 --> 00:41:08,629
Thank god for that, B.

711
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,143
I heard singing.
What's going on?

712
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,236
Tony's cousin's getting married
next week,

713
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:25,148
and one of the singers fell out,
so we're stepping in.

714
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:26,483
We need a fourth.

715
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,820
- Only question is, are you down?
- Are you kidding me?

716
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,850
With Shawn part of the group,
we can't use our old name. Blackapella?

717
00:41:33,642 --> 00:41:35,342
- True, that.
- I've...

718
00:41:35,731 --> 00:41:37,771
Actually given this some thought.

719
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:39,412
I think I got it.
What?

720
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,498
Quarterblack.

721
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,573
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes perfect sense. It's math.

722
00:41:45,698 --> 00:41:47,212
One of me and three of you.

723
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:49,339
Quarterblack would be one black
and three white.

724
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:50,632
No, wait.

725
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,009
I like the ring of that.

726
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,284
Quarterblack.

727
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,380
It's like we're all...

728
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:57,213
Randall Cunninghams.

729
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:59,776
Three to one. I think that's settled.
Quarterblack it is.

730
00:41:59,901 --> 00:42:01,601
That's not how it works.
We don't vote.

731
00:42:02,643 --> 00:42:04,437
Who thinks we should start voting?

732
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:07,816
Who's hungry?

733
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,999
Who thinks Gus should pay?
