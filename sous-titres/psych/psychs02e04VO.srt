But how did I lose?
My bike's twice as good as his.

10
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:05,259
Yeah, well you see,
that's the thing, Shawn.

11
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:08,330
Sure, your bike looks great
with all these ridiculous

12
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:11,599
reflectors and gadgets from
years' worth of cereal box tops, but

13
00:01:11,669 --> 00:01:15,350
Gus here focused
on what's important: hard work.

14
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:18,596
I'm sorry son, but he just
out-pedaled you.

15
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:22,291
- Do you understand?
- I think so.

16
00:01:24,077 --> 00:01:28,088
I got it! I had the wrong song
playing that time.

17
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,309
Best two out of three.

18
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:48,732
I know... what you're
trying to do, Shawn.

19
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:51,301
And it's not gonna work.
I'm not buying.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,956
Oh, it's on now.

21
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,872
On three. One... two...

22
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:19,900
- Let go of my chair, Shawn. The wheels!
- They're stuck together!

23
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:24,499
- Listen, you two...
- Did you see who won?

24
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,600
- I beat him, didn't I?
- No, no, no.

25
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:27,827
- Two out of three.
- Ha, that means I beat him, right?

26
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:31,461
Unlike everyone else around here,
I'm not fooled by the fact that you...

27
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:33,914
wear grown-up clothes
have mastered the rudimentary

28
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:36,477
levels of communication and, somehow,
manage to feed yourselves.

29
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:38,963
I see you for what you are:
children.

30
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:43,041
So do me a favor and let
the grown-ups do their work.

31
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:45,344
I got a boo-boo.

32
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,332
Speaking of boo-boos,
you wouldn't happen to have

33
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:52,984
any extra unsolved cases
lying around, would you?

34
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:55,415
Spencer, there is just
no easy way to tell you

35
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,017
that I consider you a waste of
this department's time and energy.

36
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:02,063
I guess there was an easy way.

37
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:04,461
But actually I've got less patience
for you today than normal.

38
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:09,378
See, I received an invitation
to give a presentation at 21-LES.

39
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,085
21st Century Law
Enforcement Seminar?

40
00:03:14,797 --> 00:03:15,899
Yes.

41
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,144
We know that better as
"21 Saint Cent-Les. "

42
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:20,630
I like to call it
21 Cent Law Info Semin.

43
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:23,172
Go ahead... make jokes.

44
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:26,141
But we just did.

45
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:31,233
You see, kids, I will be presenting
the cutting edge technology.

46
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:33,623
Modern tools for
the new detective.

47
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,462
We're talking back-scatter
x- ray scanning, DNA sampling,

48
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,091
sonic weaponry, you name it, I am...

49
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:44,057
That's weird. I could have
sworn that I...

50
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:48,161
- I don't believe it.
- Don't believe what?

51
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:53,093
My car, it's gone. It was right
there. It's... It's been stolen.

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,100
- Who would dare steal my car?
- Well, here's the good news.

53
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:04,022
It'll make for an amusing anecdote during
your presentation at 21 Saint Cent-Les.

54

63
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:32,635
All right, just keep
your mouth shut.

64
00:04:32,657 --> 00:04:34,502
I don't want people
to think anything's wrong.

65
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,879
Morning, O'Conell. Schwartz. Dobson.

66
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:41,014
Just rapping with the fellas,
shooting the breeze.

67
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:42,727
Sweet, now they'll just
think it's 1974.

68
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:46,426
Wait a minute.
Is... is this a prank?

69
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:50,139
Did you take my car?
Is this some sort of "punking"?

70
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:54,772
To think that we would stoop so low as
to tamper with police-issued property,

71
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,627
and defile the institution that is
the Santa Barbara police department,

72
00:04:58,671 --> 00:05:00,406
is an affront to our honor.

73
00:05:00,494 --> 00:05:01,875
I for one, am greatly offended.

74
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,444
And I, for two.

75
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,049
I just don't see
how this could have happened.

76
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:08,833
Did you?

77
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,911
- Wait! I'm getting something.
- What, Shawn? What is it?

78
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:24,050
It's a trace on Lassie's car.
It's faint, but clear.

79
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:26,989
You were recently somewhere where the
security of your car was compromised.

80
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:29,232
I'm sensing someplace posh.

81
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:33,407
Surprisingly upscale for someone
on half a civil servant's salary.

82
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:37,701
As it happens, I... dined at a very
exclusive restaurant last night.

83
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,652
The type of restaurant
one would take a date to?

84
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:44,580
Is old Lassie back in the game?

85
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:47,422
It is non of your business with
whom I spend my personal time.

86
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:49,309
Now you have to dish.
She blonde ?

87
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:50,403
- Brunette?
- Mail order?

88
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:51,894
You sly dog.

89
00:05:51,938 --> 00:05:56,988
Please, I'm not gonna engage in some
sort of juvenile masculinity contest.

90
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,861
- He went by himself.
- Yeah.

91
00:05:57,884 --> 00:06:00,447
Her name was Polly Smith.
324 Sycamore Lane.

92
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:04,154
- We kissed. Ask her.
- Polly Smith?

93
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:11,573
Something happened at that restaurant
that led to your car being stolen.

94
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,275
I'm sensing red coats.

95
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:15,514
And accents.

96
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:18,819
- The British?
- No. The valets.

97
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:20,521
Check the valet departure car.

98
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:22,631
He may have used the old
"key in the putty" trick

99
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:23,966
to get an impression.

100
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,024
Of course, that would have been
my first deduction, had I not been...

101
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,980
overcoming this blatant violation.

102
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,262
I'm gonna get right over there.

103
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:36,814
- No, oh.
- No car, remember?

104
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:42,454
You guys are so funny.
Oh, guess what.

105
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,983
I just got a new car.
Yours.

106
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:48,198
Maybe we had a little
too much fun with him.

107
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,492
Maybe.

108
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:56,714
I have to pee-pee.

109
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:04,843
May I help you, gentleman?

110
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,361
The theft of police
property has occurred.

111
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:08,405
I have reason to believe
the guilty party works here.

112
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:09,461
Oh, dear.

113
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:12,555
Well, rest assured you have
our complete cooperation.

114
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:15,441
I only ask that you keep
your investigation under wraps.

115
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:17,093
You know, for appearance sake.

116
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:20,305
Noted. Now, I'm gonna need to
sequester your main dinning room

117
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:23,410
interview your entire valet staff,
and possibly your busboys.

118
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:24,820
One moment.

119
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,073
- Yeah, he's gonna be a problem.
- I don't know.

120
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:30,372
- He seemed pretty cooperative.
- Your work here is done.

121
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:32,564
I'll get my car back soon enough.
Here.

122
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:36,089
But I'm warning you, if word
of this little incident

123
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:38,652
gets out of the station,
I will start making things very

124
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:40,647
difficult for you down there.

125
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:44,375
You're saying you haven't
even been trying?

126
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:45,778
All this time?

127
00:07:46,154 --> 00:07:47,402
Good-bye.

128
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:54,980
He's not gonna get anywhere
talking to those valets.

129
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:56,261
They have a very strict code.

130
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:58,085
I still think you're
thinking about the British.

131
00:07:58,122 --> 00:08:00,011
May have to roll my sleeves up
for this one, Gus.

132
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:02,895
Actually, I may have
to take off my entire shirt.

133
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:03,920
Please don't.

134
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:07,080
Oh, later.

135
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:14,164
Hi there. My name is Shawn Spencer.

136
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:17,229
I'm the head psychic for the
Santa Barbara police department.

137
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:18,936
And I may need to get
a statement from you.

138
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,130
More specifically,
the word "yes. "

139
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:22,220
Nice try.

140
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,975
But I reserve the right
to refuse service to anyone.

141
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:31,925
That's all right.

142
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,433
If my parents were visiting,
I probably wouldn't

143
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:38,820
wanna waste time meeting handsome
new strangers either.

144
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:41,467
Regardless of how smart
or interesting they might be.

145
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:45,049
My parents are visiting.
That was pretty impressive.

146
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:46,375
You really are psychic.

147
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:48,779
Sorry, I thought you were
just hitting on me.

148
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:52,335
Oh, I'm actually much more interested
in going out with your parents.

149
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:54,835
I love the Miniatures Museum.

150
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:59,232
What was it you need
to ask me about?

151
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:00,967
Do you recall any uh...

152
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:05,048
suspicious behavior from any
of the valets on duty last night?

153
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:07,965
Now that you mention it, we had
a new guy who started yesterday,

154
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:09,926
- but didn't show up this morning.
- Bingo.

155
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:11,762
Gonna need a name
and a phone number.

156
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,938
Of course.

157
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:15,449
And then...

158
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,289
I'll give you the information
about the valet.

159
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:28,000
Get this. The valet's number is
actually a number to a pay phone

160
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:32,564
outside of a warehouse. Yeah.
I don't know.

161
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:35,926
I don't know if it looks like
the warehouse from Blue City, Gus.

162
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,683
You're the only one
that rembers that movie.

163
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:39,756
What, are you insane?

164
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:42,176
Way more people saw
from The Hipthan Blue City...

165
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:44,088
Look, I'm not gonna talk
Judd Nelson right now.

166
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:47,619
No, just... just meet me at the
station in an hour. Thank you.

167
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,441
A warehouse?
Sweet!

168
00:09:51,497 --> 00:09:54,082
There's always something happening
on the DL inside a warehouse.

169
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,016
You staked it out, right?
I know you staked it out.

170
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:57,999
Oh, it got staked. Stook.

171
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:00,839
Staken?

172
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:03,555
- Staked, right?
- Right.

173
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:05,693
Yeah, yeah... it got staked.

174
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:07,196
You found out what happened
to Lassiter's car?

175
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,959
A whole bunch of cars go in,
but only boxes full

176
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,387
of car parts come out.

177
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,792
Dude, it's a chop shop.

178
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:16,405
That's big.

179
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:20,692
Victims... I see victims everywhere!
It's horrible!

180
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:25,131
Sawed-off parts strewn about.
Fluids spraying in every direction.

181
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:26,159
Oh, dear God!

182
00:10:26,214 --> 00:10:27,430
Are we talking about
a serial killer?

183
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:30,480
I can see the victims' names.
Accord, look out!

184
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:31,400
Get outta there!

185
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,978
Escalade, don't let
him  in the door.

186
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:38,393
- Oh, Camry, you were too young to go!
- Are we talking about cars?

187
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:42,429
- Stolencars?
- The signal's too strong.

188
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:44,768
I'm getting "chop sticks. "

189
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:46,378
- "Chopped salad?
- What?

190
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:50,547
- "Chop suey?"
- Good God!

191
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,683
"Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch. "

192
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:57,270
Does that mean anything to you?
"Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch. "

193
00:10:57,876 --> 00:11:00,622
- Chop shop! It's a chop shop.
- Yes!

194
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:04,907
And... and I see a warehouse.
And cargo containers.

195
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,998
And a street sign. And a little
mouse named Algernon in a maze.

196
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:09,312
Flower Street!

197
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,314
Flower Street...
that's down by the tracks.

198
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:12,827
We better check this out.

199
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:16,292
You know you just bought that, right?

200
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:41,343
Looks like a slam dunk, Mr. Spencer.
Wally there is the ringleader.

201
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:44,382
And all the evidence we need
to take him down is right here.

202
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,879
I mean, stolen parts,
serial numbers, shipment logs...

203
00:11:46,912 --> 00:11:49,136
- You name it.
- No need to thank me, Chief.

204
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,117
Just glad to help.
Don't thank him either.

205
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,593
Well, if I can't thank you
I can't pay you.

206
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:58,003
- Our pleasure.
- Oh, you're very welcome. You are.

207
00:11:58,056 --> 00:12:02,048
You know, this ring was responsible
for hundreds of car thefts around town.

208
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:03,676
Wally had operatives
in places...

209
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:05,852
mechanics, valets,
car wash attendants...

210
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,963
all copying people's keys
and then stealing their cars

211
00:12:08,997 --> 00:12:10,191
from different locations.

212
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,604
Does it say anything in there
about them stealing loose change

213
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:14,332
or switching the presets
on radios?

214
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,200
'Cause that happens to me
all the time.

215
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:17,581
Okay, Gus.

216
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:21,086
Go ahead and put your aluminum
foil hat back on.

217
00:12:21,144 --> 00:12:23,400
I'm not paranoid, Shawn. It happens.

218
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:25,515
Anyway, I believe this is
a department record

219
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,477
for the fastest bust ever
in a case this size.

220
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,252
Truly your most efficient work.

221
00:12:33,446 --> 00:12:36,282
Oh, stop. That's so unnecessary.

222
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:41,217
You know, I couldn't help but notice
that a certain vehicle belonging

223
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:45,595
to a certain head detective
just happens to not be here.

224
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,300
Lassie, we had the boys
from crime scene

225
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:51,272
move your car up the street right
before you and the Chief arrived.

226
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,482
You're in the clear, tiger.

227
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:56,712
Thanks.

228
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:01,693
Although... today
is a street sweeping day.

229
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,505
Did we park on the east side
or the west side of the street?

230
00:13:03,571 --> 00:13:05,756
- North side.
- No, no, no. It wasn't the north side.

231
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,521
Yes, it was. I'd know, Shawn.

232
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,087
I'm good with directions.
You're not.

233
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,770
Gus, you have the bearings
of a wounded bumblebee.

234
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:11,532
Why would...

235
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,750
We need to get out of here.

236
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,486
Well, you're certainly
a unique guy, Shawn.

237
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:24,284
A guy who calls
the day he gets the number.

238
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:29,275
- And brings flowers.
- I stole the flowers. From table one.

239
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,889
They're fake, and they smell vaguely
of creamy pesto, but I'm pretty sure

240
00:13:32,922 --> 00:13:34,369
it's the thought that counts.

241
00:13:35,638 --> 00:13:39,207
And you're good enough to come
and meet me here my last

242
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,350
free night before my parents arrive.

243
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:44,383
Oh, wrapping up this case
was a lot easier than I thought.

244
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:48,262
And this is one of the biggest
strawberries I've ever seen.

245
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,958
Impressive.

246
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:52,095
I've been here all day.

247
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:56,084
So... what do you say we take our
dessert back to my place?

248
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,542
I say yes.

249
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:02,425
Was this too easy?

250
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:04,684
I beg your pardon?

251
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,113
Nothing. I'm sorry. Never mind.

252
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:15,000
I can't believe how quickly
I nailed this.

253
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:18,626
- Am I really this good?
- Excuse me?

254
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,559
I mean, is it possible that... no.

255
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,752
No, nothing like this
has ever happened before.

256
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:26,931
And nothing's going to happen
tonight either.

257
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,468
How dare you think that I'm easy?
Good-bye.

258
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,522
What... no. No, no, no.
I'm not talking about you.

259
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:37,561
This is... this is something
much worse.

260
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:40,787
This is the first time
I've been wrong about a case.

261
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:45,578
Gus, I'm telling you,
it was too easy.

262
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,905
Why would this Wally guy
slip up by stealing

263
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:50,159
a detective's car from in front
of a police station?

264
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,720
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Sure it does.

265
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:52,957
One of his guys got sloppy.

266
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,587
Gus, I'm pretty sure I saw him
smile as they loaded him

267
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:56,592
into the squad car.

268
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:59,800
What, he thinks going
to prison is dope? No, come on.

269
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:02,827
I think I solved the crime
I was supposed to solve.

270
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:04,610
Not the crime I should've solved.

271
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:06,700
Okay, you're not making
any sense.

272
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,351
And I happen to be busy,
so if you don't mind?

273
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,539
What are you doing? What is this?
What, are you going somewhere?

274
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:15,141
Yes, actually, I am.
I finally have a free weekend.

275
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,224
Which means I get to use
the Spa Utopia package I won

276
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,700
for being top sales rep.

277
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:21,878
It comes complete with
town car and driver.

278
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:24,994
Gus, you've been bragging about that
award for over a year... why go now?

279
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,077
Maybe I kept pushing it back because
I was always working a second job.

280
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:30,491
Like when I had to enter
a Civil War reenactment?

281
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:34,169
Or when I was protecting
a sorority of pajama-clad coeds.

282
00:15:34,214 --> 00:15:35,772
You're actually complaing about that?

283
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:39,896
No, I'm not. But let's not forget
about the entire week I gave up

284
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:44,032
riding shotgun to a cat, which, by
the way, was not a boy cat at all.

285
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:45,616
That's some serious stress, Shawn.

286
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:49,516
I have to get a deep-tissue massage
to work out all the knots in my back.

287
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,803
I call the big one "Little Shawn. "

288
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,220
Okay, that's the creepiest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

289
00:15:55,283 --> 00:15:57,349
They have a blind masseuse up
there named Gloria.

290
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,400
I hear she works wonders.
I can't wait.

291
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,907
What is it with you and the blind?

292
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,819
I remember you went crazy for that
blind sculptor that did your bust.

293
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:08,913
That was Lionel Richie
in the video for Hello.

294
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:13,295
Great. Now I'm gonna have
that song stuck in my head.

295
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:16,053
Good. Good-bye, Shawn.

296
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:25,517
Chief! We gotta reopen
the chop shop case.

297
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,678
I'm pretty sure
we missed something.

298
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:31,166
First of all, "we" don't decide
to reopen cases. I do.

299
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:31,935
That's what I meant.

300
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:33,659
- Morning, Chief.
- Morning.

301
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,060
Uh, Lassiter, Mr. Spencer seems to
think we might have missed something

302
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:40,379
in the chop shop case.

303
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:43,142
No... no, that's an open-and-shut
case if ever I've seen one.

304
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:45,936
Sorry, Mr. Spencer, but if you want
to reopen the case, you're gonna

305
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,753
need to come up with
some concrete evidence.

306
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:52,615
We don't devote department
resources to personal whims.

307
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,461
Carlton, I finished the PowerPoint
slides for your 21-LES presentation.

308
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,040
This is... official
department business?

309
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:01,338
Oh, you're right, Helvetica is
a much better font.

310
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,885
I know... see how the M
in "double murder suicide"

311
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:05,631
just jumps off the page?

312
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:06,925
Okay.

313
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:10,770
Is there anyone left that I can
actually speak to about this case?

314
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:17,864
Like I said, there's still...
quite a few unanswered questions.

315
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:20,169
Well, what can I say?
You guys got me fair and square.

316
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:24,678
That's just it. What kind of chop
shop artist steals a cop's car

317
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,905
and doesn't chop it up?

318
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:27,997
It's almost like you wanted
to leave a trail.

319
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,897
Leave a trail, don't leave
a trail, wouldn't do any good.

320
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:33,549
You guys caught me quick. Snap!
Mind of a cheetah.

321
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:35,807
I was like, "What?"
Cops are like, wham! Miranda.

322
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,482
Yeah, well, there's still
some questions.

323
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:44,267
For instance, why haven't you
posted bail, Wally?

324
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,874
Oh, it's all good. You know, I'am
just do my time. With good behavior.

325
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:50,956
And go on with my life.
Till then, I'm like,"My bad!"

326
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,028
The court's like,
"Get in that cell. " Justice.

327
00:17:55,096 --> 00:17:57,400
Okay. Let's try this again.

328
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,553
Prisoner 1906,
visiting time is over.

329
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:01,740
Gotta go.

330
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:29,619
Your massage therapist will be
right with you, Mr. Guster.

331
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,946
In the meantime, please relax.
And hydrate.

332
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:33,908
Thank you.

333
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:44,126
Excuse me. Excuse me, do you mind?
Shawn, what are you doing here?

334
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:49,896
Sorry. Shawn,
what are you doing here?

335
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:53,100
Trust me. The way today's going,
I need to relax too.

336
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:55,155
I can't get the Chief
to reopen the case.

337
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:56,492
I already...

338
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,478
I already told you
I'm not helping you either.

339
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,419
- You will when you hear this.
- What?

340
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,896
I visited Wally.

341
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:05,281
In prison.

342
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:07,536
- You went to the pen?
- I went to the joint.

343
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:08,243
You went to the clink?

344
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:10,398
According to the visitors' log,
the only other person who

345
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,614
dropped by to see Wally
was Jonny G.

346
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,950
Who turns out to be
the Jonny G. of Jonny G.'s

347
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:18,939
Bling it On Custom Auto Shop.

348
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:22,574
- So all he's guilty of is a bad pun?
- Hardly.

349
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:25,149
First Wally gets arrested
for running a chop shop,

350
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,302
then he gets visited by Jonny G.,
who works in custom auto parts.

351
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:32,214
Adds a whole new angle
to the case, Gus.

352
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:36,460
Look, is Jonny G. dirty too?
What's the G stand for?

353
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:38,128
Is Wally working for him?

354
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:40,393
What other criminal nonsense
are they up to?

355
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,824
Man, we may have just uncovered
the tip of the iceberg here.

356
00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:46,546
- That's all you've got?
- That... and this.

357
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:51,712
It burns.

358
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:55,580
Sitting here listening  to you right
now, Little Shaw just got bigger.

359
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:56,675
I beg your pardon.

360
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:58,145
- No thanks.
- Fine.

361
00:20:01,454 --> 00:20:03,012
What time are you seeing
that blind chick?

362
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:04,200
Gloria can't see me.

363
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:06,747
Dude, I know how being blind works.

364
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,846
I mean she's booked, Shawn.

365
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:10,619
I had to book
with this girl named Kelly.

366
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:11,989
I hope she's good.

367
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,852
Mr. Guster.

368
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,380
Are you ready for your massage?

369
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:21,668
- Kelly?
- Call me Kel.

370
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:25,665
Um... you know what, Kel?

371
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,996
I forgot I have another
appointment I have to go to.

372
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:29,679
Uh... thanks for your time.

373
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,110
Dude. That dude's shoulders looked
like two little baby heads.

374
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:40,835
I know. Okay, I'll help.
But I must be back in two hours.

375
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:42,438
That's when I booked
the isolation chamber.

376
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,834
Sweet. We'll take your town car.

377
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:46,658
You're not naked under there,
are you?

378
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:48,614
Naked and unashamed.

379
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:51,125
Man... I'll be outside.

380
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,909
How are we gonna get this information
out of Jonny G.?

381
00:20:57,948 --> 00:21:00,286
The dude thinks we're customers, Gus.
It's a perfect cover.

382
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,782
I don't get it.
Who wastes money tricking out a car?

383
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:04,325
It's frivolous and ridiculous.

384
00:21:04,326 --> 00:21:07,142
Not to mention it compromises
the integrity of the vehicle.

385
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,495
Yo, Shawn!

386
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,439
Yo, lookin' good, man.

387
00:21:18,574 --> 00:21:20,583
- Wassup, homie?
- Jonny G., how are ya?

388
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,545
- Good, man.
- This is my friend, Ovaltine Jenkins.

389
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,400
Oh, respect, a'ight?
What's up, O?

390
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:25,510
- What's happening?
- Peace, man.

391
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:28,410
Yo, check it out.
Your ride is fresh to death.

392
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:30,673
Always do the last checks
myself, you know what I mean?

393
00:21:30,674 --> 00:21:32,804
Just to make sure it meets specs.
You know what I mean?

394
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:34,144
- I do know what you mean.
- You know what I mean?

395
00:21:38,737 --> 00:21:39,741
What ride?

396
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:40,973
This one.

397
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,127
My car!

398
00:21:44,748 --> 00:21:47,139
- Shawn!
- I told you it was the perfect cover.

399
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:48,903
That is fresh to death.

400
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:02,204
This is a company car, Shawn.

401
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:04,890
- I have to visit clients in this.
- Would you relax?

402
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:08,694
I can't believe you spent all our money
from the chop shop case on this.

403
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:11,104
What? You couldn't find
any magic beans?

404
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:13,501
A "Jack and the Beanstalk" reference?
Really?

405
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,841
- You wasted our money.
- I reinvested it in the business, Gus.

406
00:22:16,842 --> 00:22:19,066
Once we figure out what's up
with Jonny G.'s shop

407
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:21,051
and re-solve the case,
we'll get another check.

408
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,721
And you want to know what
we are going to do with it?

409
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:24,440
- Party like it's 1999.
- No, we're gonna...

410
00:22:24,482 --> 00:22:25,176
- Party.
- Shawn.

411
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:25,877
- Karamu?
- No!

412
00:22:25,905 --> 00:22:27,194
- Fiesta?
- We're gonna spend that money

413
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:28,850
turning my car back
to the way it was.

414
00:22:28,907 --> 00:22:31,870
All right. But I still don't see why
you won't drive it like this.

415
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:34,620
- Because! It's embarrassing.
- Embarrassing?

416
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,345
Dude, this is sweet.
This is fresh to death.

417
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,977
You won't enjoy it,
I will.

418
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:49,652
What's up, ladies?

419
00:22:50,062 --> 00:22:51,845
Nice ride. That's hot.

420
00:22:52,114 --> 00:22:53,119
Thank you.

421
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,743
You're hot!

422
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,775
You are so hot!

423
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:00,678
Get out of my seat.

424
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:03,225
- You said you didn't want to drive.
- It's my ride, Shawn.

425
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:04,230
I'm driving.

426
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:19,309
Just get us to the station.

427
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,614
I gotta convince the Chief to let us
snoop around Jonny G.'s operations.

428
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:25,043
What now?

429
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:35,747
I'm gonna need your license
and regis...

430
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,600
I... I didn't know it was you guys.

431
00:23:40,456 --> 00:23:43,357
Sorry, but in this car, you just
happen to fit a profile.

432
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:47,333
I'm really sorry to bother you guys.

433
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:53,005
Mauler! Heel! Heel!

434
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,708
Now I'm really, really sorry.

435
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:57,760
He's just a trainee for K9 unit.

436
00:23:57,907 --> 00:23:59,775
Obviously, he's not gonna make it.

437
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:01,615
Sorry again, fellas.

438
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,656
And Gus?

439
00:24:03,657 --> 00:24:05,199
Mauler barks at all cars.

440
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,699
Not just blue ones.

441
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:10,564
Carlton, it's here!

442
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:14,230
Is this the new nanomaterial vest
we ordered for 21-LES?

443
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,702
Yes, it's gonna kill.

444
00:24:16,075 --> 00:24:18,820
"The KEV-TEK 7000 is made with
nanomaterial polymers

445
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:21,961
that give it enough strength
to stop a tank mortar shell. "

446
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:23,616
I can't wait to try it out.

447
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:27,366
Oh, no, no, no. Last time, you got to be
incapacitated by the sonic gun.

448
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:28,502
Now it's my turn.

449
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:32,720
- Let go, O'Hara.
- Oh, come on.

450
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:33,795
Drop it!

451
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:35,988
- Just let me try it...
- You know I've had just about enough

452
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:37,050
of the two of you.

453
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:39,777
You can both be shot.
Just sign the waivers.

454
00:24:45,995 --> 00:24:47,297
Sonny...

455
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:48,528
was a cuckoo bird.

456
00:24:48,764 --> 00:24:50,844
Clearly he was cuckoo for something.

457
00:24:51,378 --> 00:24:53,076
- Cocoa Puffs.
- Exactly.

458
00:24:53,288 --> 00:24:55,565
- I always thought it was Cuckoo Puffs.
- No...

459
00:24:55,566 --> 00:24:58,511
Sonny is cuckoo for the puffs,
which are coco.

460
00:24:58,512 --> 00:25:00,592
That's why the milk turns
all brown and chocolatey.

461
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,087
I was never allowed to eat
that stuff when I was a kid.

462
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:05,984
That's why I don't have any cavities.

463
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:09,316
- So, are we having cereal?
- Yes.

464
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:11,114
But I'm getting more.

465
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:14,233
...9459687.

466
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:16,370
7635452.

467
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:18,168
250960.

468
00:25:18,296 --> 00:25:20,319
- Are these serial numbers?
- Yes, but there's more.

469
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:21,992
I see shiny rims.

470
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:24,262
Spoilers.
Hammered rims.

471
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,955
Spencer, is this about the chop shop?

472
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:27,994
- 'Cause we told you the case is closed.
- Now, hold on...

473
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:30,980
this is very specific information.

474
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:34,485
O'Hara, run the numbers
by the crime lab,

475
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:36,664
just to make sure we didn't
miss anything in the sweep.

476
00:25:36,944 --> 00:25:39,825
And you better not be wasting
department time, Mr. Spencer.

477
00:25:39,826 --> 00:25:42,132
Because if you are, we'll be
using these new vests on you.

478
00:25:42,172 --> 00:25:43,672
- That's a great idea.
- Thank you.

479
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:46,757
Because that way, it's a plus for me
whether they work or fail.

480
00:25:49,993 --> 00:25:52,412
It better not take long for Juliet
to run those numbers.

481
00:25:52,441 --> 00:25:53,403
It won't.

482
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:56,629
I already missed all of yesterday
on this already-solved case.

483
00:25:57,011 --> 00:25:58,827
This is my last day
to enjoy my vacation.

484
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:01,346
You don't realize how much stress
I've been on these past few...

485
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:07,089
I'm not playing, Shawn.
I never get to do anything for myself.

486
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,498
I'm getting that massage.

487
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:11,272
And yes, I'll be naked and
unashamed under my robe

488
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:13,267
while they rub
Little Shawn down!

489
00:26:17,997 --> 00:26:20,176
Wait! It wasn't like that!

490
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:29,021
Jules, what do you got
on those serial numbers?

491
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,989
Well, the good news is,
they tracked them to car parts.

492
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:35,701
The bad news is, the parts were
purchased legitimately for Bling it On.

493
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,882
And the even worse news...

494
00:26:37,883 --> 00:26:40,330
is that Lassiter wants to know
what size vest you wear.

495
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,883
Very funny.

496
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,214
Thanks for making my life
more challenging.

497
00:26:45,332 --> 00:26:48,148
- The car parts at the shop were legit?
- Looks that way.

498
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:50,879
There must be something else
going on down there that we're missing.

499
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,626
Besides selling stolen car parts.

500
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:54,735
We gotta get back down there
and look for clues.

501
00:26:54,976 --> 00:26:57,495
I don't know about you,
but I'm still on vacation.

502
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:05,422
Looks like something's wrong
with your in-dash

503
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,579
DVD navigation and integrated
surround sound system.

504
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:10,045
That was my speedometer.

505
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,930
Now I can't see how fast I'm going.

506
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:15,159
Regardless, we've gotta take it back
to Jonny G. to fix.

507
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:22,831
Hey, dude. Is Jonny G. around?

508
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:24,778
Uh, don't know. We've been busy.

509
00:27:25,506 --> 00:27:27,614
- What you working on there?
- Getting this fleet ready

510
00:27:27,615 --> 00:27:28,913
to ship to Arizona.

511
00:27:32,474 --> 00:27:33,564
Okay, thanks.

512
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:36,255
And stealth mode.

513
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:43,665
- What are we looking for, anyway?
- Anything that points

514
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:45,165
to criminal activity.

515
00:27:45,272 --> 00:27:48,018
You know... a white cloth sack
with a green dollar sign.

516
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:49,391
A red barrel labeled "TNT."

517
00:27:49,392 --> 00:27:51,033
An anvil. Anything.

518
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:55,624
- Check this out.
- What, you already have something?

519
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:58,215
The point of those examples was to imply
it wouldn't be so obvious.

520
00:27:58,356 --> 00:27:59,675
Look how light it is.

521
00:28:00,057 --> 00:28:02,618
Awesome. Flavor Flav can
wear it around his neck.

522
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:04,966
Flav wears clocks, not rims, Shawn.

523
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:09,570
Why don't you put
your phone on vibrate?

524
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:11,905
Dad, this is not a good...

525
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:15,066
Okay, relax.

526
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:17,967
I will be right there.

527
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:20,597
- We gotta go.
- Go?

528
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,295
We either need to be working on this case,

529
00:28:22,296 --> 00:28:23,828
or I need to be back on my vacation.

530
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:25,314
He said he needed me there immediately.

531
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:28,045
I've never heard him sound this urgent.
I hope everything's okay.

532
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:32,098
Here. Scale.

533
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:36,278
- This was the urgent emergency?
- Yeah..

534
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,415
Gotta get these on the grill
before it's too late.

535
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:40,976
I can't believe you had me
rush down here for this, Dad.

536
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,429
I thought something was
actually wrong with you.

537
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,113
- What's wrong with you?
- You remember how to scale,

538
00:28:44,114 --> 00:28:46,551
- don't you, Shawn?
- Yes, I remember how to scale.

539
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:48,476
You only made me do it
1000 times as a kid.

540
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,080
A kid who didn't believe
in animal cruelty, by the way.

541
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:54,401
Those animals would've
killed you dead, given the means.

542
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,198
All right, you scrape the scales,

543
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:58,805
you don't bruise the flesh,
you make an incision around the gill,

544
00:28:58,806 --> 00:29:00,588
- and you fillet...
- Down the spine.

545
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:03,988
Very good. You do remember.

546
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:05,785
And Gus, you remember...

547
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:07,775
where the bathroom is.

548
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:12,417
You're taking me away from
very important work right now.

549
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:16,035
I'll have you know I'm on the verge
of uncovering something big, really big.

550
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:17,036
Huge.

551
00:29:20,683 --> 00:29:22,650
Did you ever have a case
you couldn't crack?

552
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:26,788
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Of course.
More than a few.

553
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:30,727
But a good detective learns the most
when he doesn't get the bad guy.

554
00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:33,899
- No, I got the bad guy.
- Oh, well, sometimes he gets off.

555
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,951
But a good detective doesn't
let that get him down.

556
00:29:35,994 --> 00:29:37,436
No, he's still in jail.

557
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:40,494
Matter of fact, Chief Vick even says
it's my best work.

558
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:42,207
All right, then what's the problem?

559
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:45,015
It doesn't feel like
my best work, you know?

560
00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:47,286
It feels too easy.

561
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,974
Did you ever have that problem?

562
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:59,046
No, Shawn, I don't recall any
champagne problems like things being...

563
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,782
too easy.

564
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,457
I don't know, I guess...

565
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:05,549
I just imagined my best work
would be more complicated, you know?

566
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:07,209
More...

567
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,795
Intricate, important, and...

568
00:30:09,796 --> 00:30:11,805
Just more, you know, more.

569
00:30:11,864 --> 00:30:15,534
As always, you go after something
for the flash, for the excitment.

570
00:30:15,535 --> 00:30:17,558
And when you finally get it,
you're never satisfied.

571
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:20,275
- It always needs something more.
- That is categorically untrue.

572
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:22,966
Your best case, what does it need?
It needs more excitement.

573
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:25,556
Your first bike, what did it need?
More reflectors...

574
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,091
Well, Shawn, did you ever stop and think
that maybe it's your expectations

575
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,402
that need to change?

576
00:30:29,403 --> 00:30:31,390
Son, look at me.
Look, Shawn.

577
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:34,004
Sometimes, a case...

578
00:30:34,005 --> 00:30:35,476
...is just a case.

579
00:30:38,952 --> 00:30:40,975
He's just a trainee for K9 unit.

580
00:30:41,003 --> 00:30:42,008
Wait a second.

581
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:43,740
Wait a second.
I just figured it out.

582
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:45,382
Wait, wait, don't...
Shawn, don't do this.

583
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,031
Oh, this is much bigger than we thought.

584
00:30:47,064 --> 00:30:49,257
- And I was right all along.
- Shawn, don't you dare...

585
00:30:49,258 --> 00:30:53,394
don't you dare learn a wrong lesson while
I'm trying to teach you a right lesson!

586
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:55,726
Look how light it is.

587
00:30:55,782 --> 00:30:57,291
Getting this fleet ready
to ship to Arizona.

588
00:30:57,337 --> 00:30:59,813
Stop it... stop... stop...
stop trying to figure it out.

589
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:01,341
- Stop jumping!
- I can't help it!

590
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:03,470
It all makes sense!
Gus, we gotta go!

591
00:31:03,484 --> 00:31:05,476
- I'll explain on the way.
- Shawn, Shawn!

592
00:31:05,477 --> 00:31:07,414
You should be happy
with a job well done,

593
00:31:07,415 --> 00:31:10,174
regardless of the excitement
that it produces.

594
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:11,452
Is that it?

595
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,518
Yeah, that's it.

596
00:31:15,244 --> 00:31:17,395
Is it a tight knot right under
the shoulder blade?

597
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:18,722
Yeah, how'd you know?

598
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:19,968
Gus!

599
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,563
Jonny G. is smuggling drugs
out of state inside a car parts.

600
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:27,472
That's why those rims at the office
were so light, dude.

601
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:28,746
They were hollow!

602
00:31:28,747 --> 00:31:30,091
And that's how he gets the drugs out.

603
00:31:30,092 --> 00:31:32,015
And some of that residue
must've gotten on your car,

604
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:34,789
which is why that police dog
went crazy barking at the wheels.

605
00:31:34,948 --> 00:31:36,780
That's what Wally's been
covering for all along.

606
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:39,469
He's just a fall guy.
Jonny G.'s running the real operation.

607
00:31:39,512 --> 00:31:41,287
Drug trafficking.

608
00:31:41,288 --> 00:31:44,651
We need to make it back to that shop
before the evidence leaves for Arizona.

609
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,043
Let's go!

610
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,003
- Damn it, we're too late.
- Somebody's here.

611
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:55,557
Jonny G.!

612
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,381
Dude!

613
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:19,475
His foot is still on the accelerator.

614
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:27,617
Stop! This isn't funny.

615
00:32:28,986 --> 00:32:30,700
You stop.

616
00:32:31,663 --> 00:32:32,795
I can't!

617
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,418
The nitrous oxide canister's open.

618
00:32:42,446 --> 00:32:45,050
Laughing gas? That stuff is deadly
in high doses.

619
00:32:46,525 --> 00:32:48,747
At least we know
what the cause of death is.

620
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:55,701
I can't believe Jonny G.
went out like that.

621
00:32:55,913 --> 00:32:57,583
The police suspect foul play.

622
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:59,632
But so far, they have no leads.

623
00:32:59,675 --> 00:33:01,260
All while I was on lockdown?

624
00:33:01,965 --> 00:33:04,527
Guess I ended up with a
better sentence than Jonny G. did.

625
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:06,381
Irony.

626
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:09,806
We still have a few questions.

627
00:33:10,241 --> 00:33:13,892
What do you know about a shipment
of custom cars on its way to...

628
00:33:13,893 --> 00:33:15,038
Arizona?

629
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:16,460
We were partners, but...

630
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,092
Jonny G. was involved in a lot
of stuff I didn't know about.

631
00:33:19,234 --> 00:33:22,287
If I asked questions, he'd be like,
"Nunya. " I'd be like, "Okay." Relegate.

632
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:24,302
So... so... you're saying

633
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,455
you weren't involved with
the custom car shop at all?

634
00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:28,705
I'm saying I was just
a front man for the chop shop.

635
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:30,505
And now I'm doing my time.

636
00:33:30,887 --> 00:33:32,288
But when I get out,

637
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:35,495
crime's gonna be like,
"Come out and play, Wally. Come on."

638
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:37,796
I'm be like, "No."

639
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:39,947
"Wally doesn't live here anymore."

640
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:41,714
Reassimilated.

641
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,344
Time's up.

642
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,857
Dude.

643
00:34:04,858 --> 00:34:07,236
I'm starting to think
I was wrong about Wally.

644
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,548
When? The first time
or the second time?

645
00:34:10,604 --> 00:34:11,609
Both.

646
00:34:11,793 --> 00:34:16,667
I think he's the mastermind behind this
whole drug thing and Jonny G.'s murder.

647
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,638
But Wally was in jail
when Jonny G. died.

648
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:20,713
Yeah.

649
00:34:20,714 --> 00:34:22,274
He made sure of that.

650
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:27,172
- This is a little awkward.
- Man, let's get outta here.

651
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:31,985
Wally made it easy for us to catch him
because he wanted to get thrown in jail.

652
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,893
That way, he'd be locked up
when he murdered Jonny G.

653
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:37,045
Which would give him the perfect alibi.

654
00:34:37,095 --> 00:34:38,297
With Jonny G. out of the way,

655
00:34:38,298 --> 00:34:40,469
Wally assumes sole control
of the custom car shop.

656
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,922
- And the secret drug operation.
- Hello, motive, my old friend.

657
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,054
Get this.

658
00:34:45,055 --> 00:34:48,005
According to public court records,
Wally posted bail this morning.

659
00:34:48,182 --> 00:34:49,724
Why wait until now?

660
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:52,880
Dude.

661
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:55,045
Because the big drug deal
goes down today.

662
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,559
But we don't know when or where.

663
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,870
Oh, yes, we do.

664
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:04,964
Yes, we do.

665
00:35:04,965 --> 00:35:06,561
You call Fleet Feat Trucking.

666
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,938
Find out if they're making
any custom car deliveries today.

667
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:11,606
Find out when and where.
I'll go get Jules and Lassie.

668
00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:12,695
Dude, we got this!

669
00:35:12,882 --> 00:35:16,943
As you will see, the tools in the
arsenal of the modern-day detective

670
00:35:16,944 --> 00:35:18,465
are formidable,

671
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:19,895
to say the least.

672
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:22,683
Lights, please.
Enjoy.

673
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:32,851
I pretended to be Jonny G.'s lawyer.

674
00:35:32,852 --> 00:35:35,512
Got the trucking company to tell me
that a fleet from Bling it On

675
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:37,677
is expected to be dropped off at 2:30.

676
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:39,331
I wrote the location down.

677
00:35:40,294 --> 00:35:42,529
This says "In the middle of a field. "

678
00:35:43,088 --> 00:35:45,854
- Why did you have to write that down?
- The address is on the back.

679
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:46,903
Nice.

680
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,413
We don't...
We don't have a lot of time.

681
00:35:49,456 --> 00:35:50,701
Lights, please.

682
00:35:52,647 --> 00:35:54,557
Scientific advancements

683
00:35:54,558 --> 00:35:56,955
in the mapping of the human genome,

684
00:35:56,956 --> 00:36:00,097
in the manipulation of
the building blocks of matter itself,

685
00:36:00,098 --> 00:36:05,027
have taken law enforcement into
the 21st century and beyond.

686
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,137
Thank you.

687
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,590
Thanks very much.

688
00:36:11,591 --> 00:36:13,362
So, are there any questions?

689
00:36:14,027 --> 00:36:15,032
Yes.

690
00:36:16,265 --> 00:36:20,072
I thought you were gonna show us
some new law enforcement techniques.

691
00:36:20,073 --> 00:36:22,061
We've seen all these things on CSI.

692
00:36:22,132 --> 00:36:24,453
Well, I can assure you that

693
00:36:24,454 --> 00:36:27,586
this technology represents the
latest available to police departments.

694
00:36:27,629 --> 00:36:29,751
Oh, now you're onto something, Lassie!

695
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:31,450
Spencer?

696
00:36:31,457 --> 00:36:33,558
Nobody called for a psychic.

697
00:36:33,586 --> 00:36:36,346
- Psychic? Awesome!
- I'm getting a reading here.

698
00:36:36,347 --> 00:36:37,487
It's strange.

699
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:42,128
- Gus, what is this?
- I think you may be magnetized.

700
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,988
Right in the middle
of my presentation.

701
00:37:01,087 --> 00:37:03,280
Wait, is he police sanctioned?

702
00:37:03,365 --> 00:37:04,370
Yes.

703
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:06,550
Yes, he is.

704
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:09,014
Because we at the Santa Barbara
Police Department believe in using

705
00:37:09,015 --> 00:37:11,829
every tool in our arsenal
to combat crime,

706
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,348
and Mr. Spencer here is often
under my jurisdiction.

707
00:37:14,462 --> 00:37:17,222
Wait... I'm getting a location.

708
00:37:17,223 --> 00:37:20,208
It's an abandoned
railroad track, but why?

709
00:37:20,397 --> 00:37:23,850
Please tell me, spirits of cutting-edge
law enforcement technology.

710
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:27,204
I'm getting Michael Douglas.

711
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:29,511
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

712
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:31,970
The always under-appreciated
Don Cheadle.

713
00:37:31,998 --> 00:37:33,724
- You know that's right.
- Traffic.

714
00:37:37,361 --> 00:37:40,757
Say hello to my little friend!

715
00:37:40,785 --> 00:37:41,790
Uh,Scarface.

716
00:37:42,057 --> 00:37:43,528
They're all movies about drugs!

717
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:45,226
Yes! Drugs!

718
00:37:45,227 --> 00:37:47,759
There must be a giant drug deal
going down there!

719
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,461
- Right now!
- We can send a squad car over

720
00:37:49,462 --> 00:37:50,948
- to check it out.
- Fine.

721
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,216
There's no time!
It's happening in ten minutes.

722
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:55,417
- We have to go now!
- We can't get there in ten minutes.

723
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,973
I can. Let's roll.

724
00:37:58,725 --> 00:38:00,465
- Can we come?
- Yes, of course you can come.

725
00:38:00,466 --> 00:38:02,625
You wait out front.
And we'll pull around for you.

726
00:38:15,088 --> 00:38:16,998
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

727
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,045
Thank you.

728
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:27,680
Get up against the car.

729
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:29,874
Turn around! Up against the car!

730
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:33,430
Look, we were just having
a business transaction.

731
00:38:33,431 --> 00:38:35,681
I was like, "Here are your
automotive parts, good sir,"

732
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:37,663
and he's like, "Please, take my money. "

733
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:38,724
Capitalism.

734
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:39,913
Come on.

735
00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:41,696
Oh, Wally.

736
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,636
Selling custom car parts is legal.

737
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:49,234
Killing Jonny G. to take over
his drug operation...

738
00:38:49,235 --> 00:38:50,198
not legal.

739
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,648
I'm laughing.
Ha ha ha ha.

740
00:38:53,649 --> 00:38:54,852
Entertained.

741
00:38:55,234 --> 00:38:56,239
Well, we try.

742
00:38:56,808 --> 00:38:58,530
Makes perfect sense, though.

743
00:38:58,531 --> 00:39:00,880
Knowing how much
you resented Jonny G.

744
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:03,994
for not including you in the
real business down at the shop, huh?

745
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,795
Jonny G. was involved in a lot
of stuff I didn't know about.

746
00:39:06,796 --> 00:39:10,009
If I asked questions, he'd be, like,
"Nunya." I'd be like, "Okay." Relegated.

747
00:39:10,673 --> 00:39:12,301
You figured out a way
to take him out

748
00:39:12,302 --> 00:39:14,989
and take over his entire enterprise.

749
00:39:17,345 --> 00:39:20,612
You got yourself arrested because you knew
that in jail, you'd have the perfect alibi

750
00:39:20,613 --> 00:39:22,071
when Jonny G. showed up dead.

751
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:27,094
Who would dare steal my car?

752
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,509
Brilliantly planned
this murder beforehand,

753
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,910
knowing that Jonny G.
is a creature of habit.

754
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:37,533
I always do the final checks myself,
just to make sure it meets the specs,

755
00:39:37,534 --> 00:39:39,401
you know what I mean?
You know what I mean?

756
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:41,695
That he personally inspects

757
00:39:41,696 --> 00:39:44,158
every single car on the day
that it's supposed to be delivered,

758
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:46,422
and that he is very, very thorough.

759
00:39:46,722 --> 00:39:49,369
So you figured out which canister of
nitrous oxide he'd be using,

760
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,050
and rigged it so it would leak

761
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:52,679
when the gauge redlined.

762
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:56,107
Very creative.

763
00:39:56,108 --> 00:39:58,272
But unlike last time,
there's no evidence.

764
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,005
The people's burden.

765
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:03,910
I'm sorry, Jules, what was that?

766
00:40:03,988 --> 00:40:05,163
Oh, I didn't say anything.

767
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,918
- You didn't say anything?
- No.

768
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:09,087
Well, who's the chatty Cathy with...

769
00:40:09,088 --> 00:40:10,601
back there in...

770
00:40:10,602 --> 00:40:11,634
nothing?

771
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:14,069
Well, who's...

772
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,575
who's talking?

773
00:40:16,108 --> 00:40:17,310
Some...

774
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:19,717
somebody that saw
everything go down.

775
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:20,565
Wha... who...

776
00:40:20,566 --> 00:40:21,726
who is that?

777
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:29,238
It's Bessie.

778
00:40:30,538 --> 00:40:32,377
It's Bessie the Mustang.

779
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:36,164
She's a female Mustang.
That doesn't make any sense.

780
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,509
Technically, that would make her a...

781
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,296
- what?
- That would be a filly.

782
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:42,376
A filly, everyone.

783
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:45,382
Bessie is technically a filly, she...

784
00:40:45,383 --> 00:40:46,614
I'm sorry, what?

785
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,210
Put his what in your what?

786
00:40:54,142 --> 00:40:55,796
Check inside Bessie's wheels.

787
00:40:55,797 --> 00:40:57,296
- Check inside her wheels.
- Okay, stop.

788
00:40:57,297 --> 00:40:59,362
You don't have a warrant.
That's illegal seizure.

789
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,692
Bill of Rights.

790
00:41:00,983 --> 00:41:02,709
Very suspicious behavior.

791
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:04,124
Probable cause.

792
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:06,190
- Nice, Jules.
- It's drugs.

793
00:41:06,485 --> 00:41:11,452
You are under arrest. But this time,
it's for drug trafficking and murder.

794
00:41:11,593 --> 00:41:12,980
Guess that's three strikes.

795
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:16,165
- Legislated!
- Oh, nice, Gus.

796
00:41:22,171 --> 00:41:24,067
Oh, tell me about it.

797
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:27,731
- Hey, dude.
- Hey.

798
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:31,051
Yeah, we'd like to schedule
a couple of massages with Gloria.

799
00:41:31,187 --> 00:41:33,161
I'm sorry, but Gloria's still booked.

800
00:41:33,218 --> 00:41:35,510
The only slot she has available
is a couples' session.

801
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:36,819
- No.
- That's fine.

802
00:41:37,356 --> 00:41:39,691
I mean... no way.

803
00:41:40,963 --> 00:41:41,968
Thank you.

804
00:41:42,764 --> 00:41:43,768
What's wrong with you?

805
00:41:43,825 --> 00:41:45,715
Dude, you're the one
who said she's so amazing.

806
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:46,551
I figured it was worth it.

807
00:41:46,594 --> 00:41:48,914
Me and you in the same room
with just a towel between us?

808
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:49,834
Not gonna happen.

809
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:51,014
- She's blind.
- I'm not.

810
00:41:51,043 --> 00:41:53,038
- That's naked and ashamed, Shawn.
- Maybe you're ashamed.

811
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,439
- Naked and ashamed.
- You're ashamed.

812
00:41:54,481 --> 00:41:55,401
I'm not ashamed, Shawn.

813
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:56,859
- Full of shame.
- I am not!
