1
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:21,516
Okay, come on.
Move it out.

2
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:28,362
Listen, Franks...

3
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:33,987
You have the right not to get shot.

4
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:35,322
Make the wrong move,

5
00:00:36,372 --> 00:00:37,616
you lose that right.

6
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,576
Put down the bomb.

7
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:51,298
Good move.

8
00:00:53,105 --> 00:00:55,863
We recently obtained intelligence
of a bomb plot

9
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:58,094
by an antigovernment radical.

10
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:00,347
His intended target was
this very building.

11
00:01:01,326 --> 00:01:03,182
We owe the success of this investigation

12
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:05,435
and, indeed, our very lives
to sergeant Henry Spencer.

13
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:08,304
Well done.

14
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:11,686
Sergeant Spencer, would you like
to say a few words?

15
00:01:12,264 --> 00:01:13,818
No, thanks, chief.

16
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:16,420
A police officer doesn't deserve
any special attention

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,947
for just doin' his job.

18
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:24,685
You may be able to sense
the electricity in the room.

19
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:28,333
That's because our arrival usually
signals that a huge case is going down.

20
00:01:28,593 --> 00:01:30,749
- Step in here please, gentlemen.
- That's the chief.

21
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:32,629
She likes the two of us very much.

22
00:01:34,363 --> 00:01:36,189
- I'm sorry, you are?
- Oh, sorry, chief.

23
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,748
I got roped into doing a silly interview
with the independent.

24
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:42,373
They've been calling and begging
for weeks, and I finally relented.

25
00:01:42,543 --> 00:01:45,170
- But... you called me.
- And you called me back.

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,740
Which means we're both right.

27
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,187
The important thing is that
you got your cover story.

28
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:50,871
Actually, it's page 64.

29
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,691
Depends on how you fold it, doesn't it?

30
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:54,901
She can't be in here,
so get her the hell out.

31
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,071
Come to think of it, I think

32
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:00,650
you'll probably get a better shot
here through this window.

33
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,741
Now, try to catch me with
a good expression,

34
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:05,266
preferably with this eyebrow raised...

35
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:06,587
Like so.

36
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:08,487
Or my serious face.

37
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:15,486
Best-case scenario, snap a shot
when my signature look comes up.

38
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:17,696
I call it senor gotcha!

39
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:20,357
How will I know what that is?

40
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:23,096
You'll know. Good luck.
We're all counting on you.

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,909
Lassie, you're here!
I need you... Here.

42
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:29,511
Thank you.

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,551
Chief, what's up?

44
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:37,145
Mr. Spencer, as you may be
aware, a cal...

45
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:39,606
California prisoner's advocacy...

46
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:42,115
- Are you okay?
- Right as rain.

47
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:47,067
Long story short,
a handful of convictions,

48
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:50,415
some of them decades old, have been
recently called into question.

49
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:54,634
Unfortunately, the biggest one was
a Santa Barbara P.D. conviction.

50
00:02:55,304 --> 00:02:58,322
So we're reopening the case
and launching a new investigation.

51
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:00,759
Now we're hiring y...

52
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:04,262
You to provide us with any psychic
leads that you may have.

53
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:08,326
Now, normally, we don't devote
department resources to this,

54
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:11,919
but these are... special circumstances.

55
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:13,688
Could you do the handoff again, chief?

56
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:17,891
Thanks.

57
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,031
Oh, no.

58
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:24,488
What is it?

59
00:03:25,717 --> 00:03:27,243
It's my dad's biggest case.

60
00:03:41,726 --> 00:03:45,428
<i>Psych 3x05
The disco didn't die, it was murdered.</i>

61
00:03:57,867 --> 00:04:01,110
<i>Synchro: Arrow, Golgi, IceFre@k</i>

62
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:17,836
<i>www.seriessub.com
www.sub-way.fr</i>

63
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:23,153
It goes without saying,
Mr. Spencer, that

64
00:04:23,323 --> 00:04:26,534
your father is in no way to participate
in this investigation.

65
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:28,035
He's no longer on the force,

66
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:30,265
and his meddling could compromise
the case in court.

67
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:32,720
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, you do, chief.

68
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,728
What isn't clear is why people always
say, "it goes without saying,"

69
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:39,423
yet still feel compelled to say
the thing supposed to go without saying.

70
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:42,610
- Doesn't that bother you?
- No. And frankly, I could care less.

71
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,498
Now, that's the one that bothers me.

72
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:47,866
Why do people say, "I could care less"
when they mean "I couldn't care less"?

73
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:51,181
Why don't you tell me
how to properly say this:

74
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:53,709
if you share any official information
about this case

75
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,456
with your father or let him anywhere

76
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:57,771
near any new evidence,

77
00:04:58,415 --> 00:05:01,462
then the two of you will have to find
another police department to work for.

78
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:04,342
And I will personally see to it
that each f you is charged

79
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,009
with obstruction of justice.

80
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,095
- You split an infinitive.
- Good catch, Gus.

81
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:11,639
You two realize I carry a gun, right?

82
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:13,558
That was perfectly elocuted.

83
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:19,856
My dad's gonna freak when he sees this.

84
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:21,548
We have to go into stealth mode.

85
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:23,969
No taking his calls.
This won't hit the news till tomorrow.

86
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,154
That should give us
a 24-hour head start.

87
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:27,989
Hand it over.

88
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:29,890
Dad, how did you get in here?

89
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,974
The unlatched window.
The unlocked back door.

90
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:33,950
Maybe this key that I made.
You choose one.

91
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,362
What do you want?

92
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:38,207
I dropped by to share my new chocolate
chip raisin bread recipe with you.

93
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:39,665
What do you think?

94
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:41,878
I know chief Vick just
gave you the new Franks case.

95
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:44,839
Why don't you let me take a look at what
you're hiding in that folder

96
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:46,409
so I can get moving on this?

97
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,523
Okay, you're right.
Chief Vick did just hire us.

98
00:05:48,693 --> 00:05:51,346
But there is no way that I'm showing you
what's in this folder.

99
00:05:51,595 --> 00:05:53,848
You're lucky I'm asking you.
I could do this the simple way.

100
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:55,099
I could grab it,

101
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:58,436
clean up any evidence of struggle before
you and your friend knew what hit you.

102
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:01,272
- In some states, that's child abuse.
- I think all of them.

103
00:06:01,532 --> 00:06:02,690
Look, chief Vick

104
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,801
made it clear that you, specifically,
were to come nowhere near this case.

105
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:08,422
This shouldn't even be a case.

106
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:11,324
The son of a bitch was let out on
some microcrap problem with

107
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:12,624
my search warrant.

108
00:06:12,794 --> 00:06:15,169
- Everybody makes mistakes.
- There was no mistake!

109
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:22,627
It was the 70's.
We did what we had to do.

110
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:26,214
But only when we knew we had
the right guy, and I got the right guy.

111
00:06:26,862 --> 00:06:27,910
Period.

112
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:30,315
Okay. You got the right guy.

113
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:32,991
Still doesn't mean I'm gonna
put you on this case.

114
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:34,472
Nor would I even want to.

115
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:37,016
Dad, you have no idea how
Gus and I roll... Gus, tell him.

116
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:39,727
You know what? You go ahead
and handle this half-assed

117
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:42,537
like you do everything else.
But you bear this in mind.

118
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:46,800
This case is important to
a lot of people who could have died

119
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,736
if he had blown up our headquarters.

120
00:06:52,618 --> 00:06:54,659
It should be important to
their family members too.

121
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:06,129
Never seen my dad beg before.

122
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:07,505
That's how he begs?

123
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:10,176
He's clearly not gonna let this go.

124
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,368
So look, if we're gonna investigate
this thing undisturbed,

125
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:16,764
we're gonna have to jump a few steps,
fill in the blanks when we're done.

126
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:21,185
We should go straight
to the D.A.'s office.

127
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,614
Beat you by eight minutes.
Not too embarrassing.

128
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:35,491
Dad, I knew you would come and try
to investigate this on your own.

129
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:37,593
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this is?

130
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:39,829
Why? I'm a tax paying, voting citizen.
Therefore,

131
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:43,416
I have a right to speak to any elected
official, such as the D.A., I please.

132
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:45,545
You don't have to be a...

133
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,588
- Tax paying, voting citizen, do you?
- May I help you?

134
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:51,771
Yes. My name is Shawn Spencer.

135
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:54,253
I am the head psychic for
the Santa Barbara Police Department.

136
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:56,703
- And that is my partner...
- Yeah, yeah, that's his partner,

137
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:59,307
methuselah honeysuckle,
which makes me old scratch johnson.

138
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,850
We need to see copies

139
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,228
of the original court transcripts
for the Eugene Franks case.

140
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:05,938
I'm not sure I can release those.

141
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:19,999
I'm getting a very soft,
cuddly vibe here.

142
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:21,871
It seems like you and your wife are...

143
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,581
They're gonna have another kid.

144
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:27,005
It's a boy. Congratulations.
Do yourselves a favor.

145
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:29,420
Don't call it Shawn.
Problems.

146
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:31,047
More importantly,

147
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:33,119
according to the freedom
of information act,

148
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,218
those transcripts are
available for viewing.

149
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:36,550
So...

150
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:38,598
Very well. Good point.

151
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,797
I'll have our records department
make copies.

152
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:42,475
Thank you very much.

153
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:45,319
You know, you're putting a damper
on the proceedings.

154
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:47,396
You call it a damper.
I call it working.

155
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:49,296
All right, that's it.
Come here.

156
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:52,195
All right, I need you to hear me, okay?

157
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,936
If you insist on staying involved
in this case,

158
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:56,661
there are going to be rules.

159
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,407
I was hired by the police department.

160
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:01,506
Therefore, it is my ass on the line,
and those rules will be made by me.

161
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:02,954
You are no longer a cop.

162
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:05,137
And unless you plan on going back
to the academy

163
00:09:05,307 --> 00:09:06,999
climbing the wall, doing the obstacle

164
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:09,714
course where you shoot the bad guys,
but not the lady with the sack

165
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:13,614
or the guy with the cane or the squirrel
with the tail and the big, fat nut...

166
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:15,633
That started off well.

167
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:17,328
It really fell apart at the end.

168
00:09:17,498 --> 00:09:19,554
You should have had a name
for the wall or something.

169
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:23,141
What I'm saying is that you need
to listen to me, is what I'm saying.

170
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:25,643
All right, Shawn.
Point taken.

171
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:28,354
You got a deal.

172
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:33,993
That means you're workin' for me now.

173
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:36,494
Why don't you grab some coffee for us?

174
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:38,539
Black.
Two sugars.

175
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,411
I don't understand...
You guys had to handwrite everything?

176
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:45,260
What if you need multiple copies?

177
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,450
Well, we had one computer,
but it took up the entire second floor.

178
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,294
Generally, we would use
the mimeo machine.

179
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:53,337
How long did that take, a week?

180
00:09:53,597 --> 00:09:55,471
All the high-tech fancy gadgets
they use today

181
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:57,388
don't solve crimes any better
than we did.

182
00:09:57,558 --> 00:10:00,261
A good detective is born with all
the tools he needs right here.

183
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:07,695
Hello. Chief, what's the good w...

184
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:10,980
My dad, down at the D.A.'s office?

185
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:14,692
No, I-I don't think so.

186
00:10:14,932 --> 00:10:17,197
I think I can clear this up
for ya, chief.

187
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:20,054
That wasn't my dad.

188
00:10:21,307 --> 00:10:23,326
That was Phil Collins.

189
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,386
We saw Phil down at the courthouse.

190
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:28,759
My dad gets mistaken for
him all the time.

191
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:32,376
I don't look... Shawn...
I don't look anything like phil collins.

192
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:35,254
No, I'm... I'm fairly certain
about this, chief.

193
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:38,674
He was humming invisible touch,
if that helps you.

194
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:39,683
No.

195
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:44,013
I- I wasn't aware that Phil Collins
lives in switzerland.

196
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:47,391
How does she know so
much about phil collins?

197
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,885
I don't know.

198
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:50,949
Yes. I do hear you.

199
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:53,073
I will make sure he stays away.

200
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:55,566
Love you too.

201
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:59,761
Do you see?
Do you see?

202
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:02,138
- We have to be more careful.
- Okay, hot shot.

203
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:03,734
All right, I get it.

204
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:05,765
Tell me what you can glean from this.

205
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:07,578
You'd like to know what I can glean?

206
00:11:07,838 --> 00:11:08,663
Glean.

207
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,337
The D.A. arrested after only submitting
the initial evidence?

208
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:19,548
Correct-a-mundo. The evidence
I uncovered in that department

209
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:22,391
was so strong, the D.A. didn't need
anything else to get a conviction.

210
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:25,109
But all the evidence is poisonous fruit
because of the search warrant.

211
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,347
This evidence, yes.

212
00:11:26,607 --> 00:11:28,838
Good thing I got a different warrant
for the second round.

213
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:31,644
The D.A. didn't submit any of that stuff
which means we can use that now.

214
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:34,868
All the high-tech gadgets in
the world won't tell you that, will it?

215
00:11:35,038 --> 00:11:36,200
We gotta get the chief

216
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,277
to let us into the county archives
so we can take a look at that evidence.

217
00:11:39,537 --> 00:11:41,375
- Gus, gimme your keys.
- That would be a no.

218
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:43,822
- Ogletree's checking my mileage.
- We'll take my truck.

219
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:47,535
No, we won't. That raises the chances
of you being seen again.

220
00:11:48,443 --> 00:11:51,497
We'll have to take my motorcycle.
I've always wanted to try threesies.

221
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:53,567
Who wants the handlebars?

222
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:55,763
- Gus, feels like you.
- No.

223
00:11:56,053 --> 00:11:58,170
That shouldn't draw any attention.
We'll cab it.

224
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,576
Fine.
It's funny.

225
00:12:00,746 --> 00:12:04,010
It's usually me who can't show
my face in public.

226
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:07,806
Just think, the contents
inside these boxes

227
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:10,828
could determine whether someone spends
the rest of their life in jail.

228
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:11,975
Catch.

229
00:12:12,469 --> 00:12:14,923
Better hope they don't reopen
the handyman killer case.

230
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:17,034
Your fingerprints are all over
the murder weapon.

231
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,113
- That's not funny, Shawn!
- Dude, I'm kidding.

232
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:21,331
It's not really evidence.
It was just lying here.

233
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:24,216
Well, stop it. You know I'm afraid
that being wrongfully convicted

234
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:25,823
is the tragic way my story ends.

235
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,336
Would you two girls stop bitching
and see what we got here?

236
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:29,596
What is this stuff?

237
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:32,663
Various possessions, personal effects of
Eugene's we found after he was arrested.

238
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:35,219
All right, what do we got here?

239
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,117
Pawn ticket made out to Eugene

240
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:41,097
a few days before he was arrested.

241
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:43,299
"Goldstein's pawn."
Anybody?

242
00:12:43,718 --> 00:12:45,551
Wait. That place is still around.

243
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,739
Desperate people pawn things.

244
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:51,974
Let's see what eugene pawned
and never got back, huh?

245
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,891
Two new cases just came in.

246
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:58,148
One involves an international
diamond smuggling ring.

247
00:12:58,318 --> 00:12:59,436
- Sweet!
- Bingo!

248
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:02,026
The other involves fraudulent permits
at a plastics factory.

249
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:06,364
Well, I'll leave it up to the two of you
to decide who gets which.

250
00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:12,370
- I am the head detective.
- Who owes me.

251
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,538
I covered your butt on
last month's paperwork.

252
00:13:14,798 --> 00:13:16,374
Damn it.

253
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:19,752
Follow my lead.
Mcnab!

254
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:21,327
Get over here!

255
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,299
I don't know, O'hara.
I don't think he's ready.

256
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:28,761
Yeah, I... I don't think he is either.

257
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:29,970
No. I'm ready.

258
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,340
All right.

259
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:36,727
Mcnab, how would you like to
do some real police work?

260
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:37,954
I'd love to.

261
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:41,941
Now, technically, you'll be working
under detective O'hara and myself, but

262
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:43,734
we'll let you take the lead on this.

263
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:46,767
It will be such a
good experience for you.

264
00:13:46,937 --> 00:13:50,491
It might even earn you a spot
on the detective bureau someday.

265
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:53,477
Wow! Thanks, guys.

266
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:56,414
This means a lot. The fact that you
think so highly of me

267
00:13:56,674 --> 00:13:59,409
- to trust me...
- We love you. Get back to work.

268
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:06,599
This ticket is from

269
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,185
30 years ago when my dad
ran the shop.

270
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:14,268
I'll have to go look through the box.

271
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,558
Box?

272
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,644
What do you think the box is?

273
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:19,647
A giant room like in raiders?

274
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,893
I think it's a box.

275
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:23,527
Secret catacombs underneath
the building like in national treasure?

276
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,067
Shame on you for knowing that.

277
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:29,086
This is where we keep all the
old unclaimed stuff from over the years.

278
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:31,515
- As I said, a box.
- What do you think's inside the box?

279
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:34,029
- Will you calm down?
- I can't, man! There's stuff in there!

280
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:37,070
All kinds of stuff, old stuff,
shiny stuff, secret stuff...

281
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,801
- How come you're not as excited as me?
- Because I'm not a raccoon.

282
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:42,456
- You look like a raccoon.
- Hey, you're in luck.

283
00:14:42,626 --> 00:14:44,450
This ticket here...

284
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:47,465
Matches this old receipt.

285
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:50,058
Not a lot of info on it, i'm afraid.

286
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:57,889
I know what that...

287
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:00,809
- Right. Your case.
- Oh, I'm getting something here.

288
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:02,862
Oh, this is intense.
I can see Eugene.

289
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:04,936
He's desperate
and he's sweating nervously.

290
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:08,412
He's stinky, he wants to get rid
of something, cover his tracks,

291
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,906
hide where he's been.
He brings in the title to his car.

292
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:12,998
That must be
the V.I.N.{\vehicle identification number} right in there.

293
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,395
Right.
Whose benefit was that for?

294
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:20,256
Don't ever question my methods
in front of a civilian. OK?

295
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:21,422
Never do that.

296
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:22,554
Come here.

297
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,554
I always thought that Eugene
was gonna use the car in a bomb plot.

298
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:30,524
That was a common M.O. back then.
He probably pawned the title

299
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:33,102
- to cover his tracks.
- If nobody reclaimed the title,

300
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:35,046
we would have sold it.

301
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:39,400
We could use the VIN number
to track where it ended up.

302
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:41,986
That could take us {\all}over the city
or the state, for that matter,

303
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:44,319
thus increasing the chances
that you'll be seen by someone

304
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:46,871
you work with
and you being caught by the police.

305
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:53,256
Unless...

306
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,837
Nobody recognizes us.

307
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:06,413
I feel ridiculous.

308
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,704
Speak for yourself.
I've got this shirt at home.

309
00:16:08,824 --> 00:16:11,256
- His mother used to love it.
- Yeah, like 30 years ago.

310
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:12,975
Kid, I wore it to lunch last week.

311
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,188
There it is.

312
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:20,410
It's been sittin'
in some old lady's backyard

313
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,352
- for dang near 30 years.
- You got the keys?

314
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:25,615
- Let's take a look inside.
- Make me an offer and it's yours.

315
00:16:26,214 --> 00:16:27,780
You gotta be kiddin'.

316
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:30,159
Just... give us a second here.

317
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:35,623
- How much money do we have between us?
- What?

318
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:38,827
I think I got about...

319
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:39,932
50 bucks.

320
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:43,320
I got about 400
between my wallet and my sock.

321
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,807
It's my "just in case" money.

322
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:53,192
All right. Add in what I have,
and we've got about...

323
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:55,032
450.

324
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,062
All right, let me go talk to him.

325
00:16:58,223 --> 00:17:00,140
You stand down, popeye doyle.

326
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:01,832
I'll handle this.

327
00:17:04,984 --> 00:17:08,091
Got about $450 here.
Now, how much is this gonna cost me?

328
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,907
- $450.
- Done.

329
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:12,493
He's good!

330
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:15,496
Nice goin'.
That was all of our money.

331
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:17,767
That's what happens
when you send in the one guy

332
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,458
who's never bought a car before.

333
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:22,494
- We had exactly enough.
- All right, look at it this way.

334
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:24,298
It isn't a car.

335
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,958
It's a time machine.

336
00:17:26,498 --> 00:17:30,176
This little kitty's gonna tell us
about Eugene 30 years ago.

337
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:32,263
Well, looks like a car to me.

338
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:34,158
And if I bought it, i'm drivin' it.

339
00:17:34,278 --> 00:17:36,475
That means my same car rules apply.

340
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,250
Wipe your shoes before entering.
No slamming doors.

341
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,280
No food.

342
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:50,534
Looks good up here.

343
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:11,385
Doesn't look like factory soldering.

344
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:18,434
Smuggler's hatch.

345
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:26,734
Gotta get this down to the crime lab.

346
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:31,155
Let me guess. This is where we take one
step back before involving the police.

347
00:18:31,316 --> 00:18:33,699
We need to see
what's on that film first.

348
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:38,474
That's how we roll.

349
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:56,764
I think I need a tetanus shot.

350
00:18:58,315 --> 00:18:59,199
Got it.

351
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:01,605
Miracle anything came out.

352
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:09,093
This guy really loved his car?

353
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:12,154
After seeing it all cleaned up,
I like it too.

354
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:14,425
In fact, I love it.

355
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:18,296
Bingo! You think these two other ones
could have had something to do

356
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,696
- with the bombing?
- From the AK-47s they're holding,

357
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:23,341
they had something to do with something.
{\I think}It's worth checkin' out.

358
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:26,265
There's no telling where they are,
if they're even still around.

359
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:28,977
You know, back then, I used to have
this snitch working for me.

360
00:19:29,097 --> 00:19:30,588
His name was Pookie.
Real weasel.

361
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,308
The guy would turn on
his siamese twin for a buck.

362
00:19:33,428 --> 00:19:35,177
If these two had anything
to do with this,

363
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:37,654
- Pookie's the guy who would have known.
- Sorry. What...

364
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:39,722
- What was his name?
- Pookie.

365
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,644
- Do you know where we can find this...
- Pookie?

366
00:19:45,124 --> 00:19:46,469
Yeah, his name is...

367
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:49,947
His name is Pookie Wiggington,
and I know where to find him.

368
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:53,362
- What's so funny?
- Stop, please!

369
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:56,781
Nothing's funny, you just...
But you're keepin' it real right now.

370
00:19:57,219 --> 00:20:00,244
- Right on.
- Let's see if we can find Pookie.

371
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:03,831
See if he still remembers the'70s.

372
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:18,554
If that had been on purpose,
that would have been totally cool.

373
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:22,073
I need to get that power steering fixed.
Not to mention the seat is jammed

374
00:20:22,193 --> 00:20:25,313
all the way to the front and makes
my entire left side fall asleep.

375
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,615
<i>And remember, tomorrow night will be</i>

376
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:41,450
<i>ladies' night
at the top flight dance club,</i>

377
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,829
<i>where it's the'70s every night!</i>

378
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:46,453
Don't worry!

379
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:49,376
I think Pookie remembers
the'70s just fine.

380
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:52,287
By the way,
I'm just puttin' this out there.

381
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,632
Once we re-solve this case,

382
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:58,508
preserve your legacy as a detective,
you don't have to say thank you.

383
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:00,428
- No biggie.
- Course it is.

384
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,520
Heck, let me say it right now.

385
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:03,891
Thank you.

386
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:05,331
You're welcome.

387
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:08,142
That's Pookie.

388
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:09,680
Let's go.

389
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:16,412
Officer Spencer.

390
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:18,503
Long time no see.

391
00:21:18,938 --> 00:21:21,491
What brings you gentlemen
to my establishment?

392
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:27,288
As you may have heard,

393
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:30,009
the D.A. recently overturned
the conviction on the Eugene

394
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:31,919
Franks bombing case.

395
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,854
Maybe I heard.

396
00:21:33,974 --> 00:21:35,171
Maybe I didn't.

397
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,214
Right.

398
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,085
We're lookin' for information on a few
people that might have used to run

399
00:21:40,205 --> 00:21:41,285
with old Eugene.

400
00:21:41,405 --> 00:21:43,387
Sorry. I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

401
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:45,057
All right.
I know how this works.

402
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:46,974
Hit the other sock.
Give him some money.

403
00:21:47,228 --> 00:21:49,478
No offense, guys,
but I don't need your pocket change.

404
00:21:50,514 --> 00:21:54,503
I can see two of Eugene's partners
in crime, a man and a woman...

405
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:57,736
Dangerous, highly skilled
with military weapons.

406
00:21:57,896 --> 00:21:59,321
But not U.S. military.

407
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:00,986
Smuggled

408
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:01,990
weapons.

409
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:03,866
I used to trip like that.

410
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:06,119
Always looking for the escape.

411
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,539
Pookie, he's cool.
He's...

412
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,166
Psychic.

413
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,960
Really?

414
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:16,465
Then I can dig it.
Spiritual.

415
00:22:18,695 --> 00:22:20,508
- Third eye.
- That's where it is.

416
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,679
You guys are deep.
Like me.

417
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,230
Gimme five.

418
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,394
So listen,
you were dead on it.

419
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,643
Check this out.

420
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,952
The cats you were describing
ran with Eugene, all right.

421
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:39,186
There were two of 'em.
Derek Ford, white guy, stringy hair,

422
00:22:39,306 --> 00:22:40,612
and his old lady

423
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:41,632
Melanie.

424
00:22:41,752 --> 00:22:44,866
Really fine... I got shot
over a white girl like that once.

425
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,744
Anyway, they were together in a militant

426
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:50,372
organization with Eugene called S.A.G.

427
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:53,152
Soldiers Against Government.

428
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:55,705
They were into all kind
of radical stuff.

429
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:58,839
Why would Eugene go all those years
and not rat them out?

430
00:22:59,168 --> 00:23:00,764
Word on the street was

431
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:02,831
that SAG was ruthless.

432
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:06,097
Nobody dared cross them,
not even one of their own.

433
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:08,314
So Eugene was just a Patsy?

434
00:23:08,691 --> 00:23:11,977
You didn't hear it from me.
No, them suckers are dangerous!

435
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:16,674
He had partners.

436
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:18,398
My biggest bust...

437
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:20,571
And I was wrong.

438
00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:29,611
Everything hurts.

439
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:32,203
You had to be a tough guy
and go in first.

440
00:23:32,694 --> 00:23:36,506
Let's just fill out the incident report
and be done with this fiasco.

441
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:41,424
What happened to you guys?

442
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:44,690
The diamond smuggling case
that detective O'Hara

443
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,426
wanted to take didn't go quite

444
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:48,495
- as planned.
- That I wanted to take?

445
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:51,558
You're the one who insisted on it,
Mr. Head-detective.

446
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:54,832
Basically,
we conducted a stake out to catch

447
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:57,088
the smugglers red-handed,
but when we opened

448
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,314
the cargo container
to seize the evidence,

449
00:23:59,434 --> 00:24:01,363
we discovered we had the wrong one.

450
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:04,756
This one belonged
to exotic animal smugglers.

451
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:06,447
And it was filled

452
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:08,221
with wild marmosets.

453
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:10,978
- I hate marmosets.
- Apparently, they don't like

454
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:13,119
- being shot at.
- No, apparently not.

455
00:24:13,473 --> 00:24:15,543
All I can remember after that are

456
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,106
hundreds of those... tiny,

457
00:24:18,431 --> 00:24:21,058
razor-sharp claws and teeth!

458
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,306
Lower primate, my ass.
I recognize a military formation

459
00:24:24,426 --> 00:24:25,730
when I see one.

460
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,687
You'll be happy to know
that case you gave me took a fun turn.

461
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:29,969
That's great!

462
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,035
It turns out that plastics factory
was a front for real-life sea pirates.

463
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:38,880
- You're kidding.
- They've been using high-tech boats

464
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,653
and GPS to rob freighters
in the shipping lanes.

465
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,135
Now, I'm teaming up
with the coast guard for a showdown

466
00:24:44,255 --> 00:24:47,280
- of the Santa Barbara coast.
- On the high seas?

467
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,550
Appears so.

468
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:53,133
Gosh,

469
00:24:53,663 --> 00:24:55,321
I'm sorry, Buzz, but...

470
00:24:55,441 --> 00:24:58,009
you need a certain level of clearance
to work with the coast guard.

471
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,244
It's... It's department rules.

472
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:04,538
- Really?
- I'm afraid we're gonna have to...

473
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:06,216
Take over from here.

474
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:09,052
But good work
on getting us to this point.

475
00:25:14,395 --> 00:25:16,950
- It was fun while it lasted.
- Yeah.

476
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:19,343
Good work, buddy.

477
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:25,209
- We're gonna capture pirates!
- I know!

478
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:28,988
- Almost makes up for the rabies shots.
- Almost.

479
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:33,272
Let's face it, Shawn.
I blew the case.

480
00:25:33,962 --> 00:25:35,788
- You're quitting on me?
- I'm not quitting.

481
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:38,080
I just realized
that maybe chief Vick is right.

482
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:39,540
I should stay out of it.

483
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:41,418
Dad, this was your big case.

484
00:25:42,313 --> 00:25:44,029
My big case. My big bust.

485
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:47,155
You see, that's the problem right there.
That's how I started seeing it.

486
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:48,300
But in reality,

487
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:50,703
it's a Santa Barbara P.D. case

488
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:53,847
- and always has been.
- You don't believe that.

489
00:25:54,008 --> 00:25:56,099
A good detective knows
when to let it go.

490
00:25:56,476 --> 00:25:59,280
That's a lesson both you
and I could learn right now.

491
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:06,563
- Where's your dad?
- He's not coming. He says

492
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:08,911
it's to protect the case,
but I can tell

493
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:12,326
it's really bumming him out
that he got fooled 30 years ago.

494
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:17,817
I can't believe I'm about to say this,

495
00:26:17,937 --> 00:26:21,656
but instead of lording over him
that this is our case, our rules...

496
00:26:22,193 --> 00:26:24,997
{\I think}We have to convince him that we can't
solve this thing without him.

497
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,296
How do we do that?

498
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,673
Most likely,
through the use of trickery.

499
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,053
What kind of wood are we
gonna use for these bookshelves?

500
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,472
Cypress?

501
00:26:35,632 --> 00:26:37,474
Cypress? Really?

502
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:40,267
It's a good wood.
It's what Noah's ark was made of.

503
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:42,480
You wanna use something
that breathes a little more,

504
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,731
don't worry, we'll hit
a lumberyard on the way there.

505
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:47,859
At least I get a chance
to use my new laser level.

506
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:55,390
Why are we stopping here?

507
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,876
No reason...
I just randomly selected this spot.

508
00:26:57,996 --> 00:27:00,573
Don't be a smart-ass. You're reading
an address of a piece of paper,

509
00:27:00,693 --> 00:27:03,208
we're sitting in somebody's driveway.
Whose house is this?

510
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:06,693
Actually, we're dropping
in on some people that we know.

511
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,423
Shawn, I think that's them!

512
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:13,009
- What the hell is going on?
- Don't lose 'em. Go, go!

513
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:14,116
Come on!

514
00:28:04,255 --> 00:28:06,878
- So what do we do now?
- I don't know.

515
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:08,939
I've never cornered anyone before.

516
00:28:17,484 --> 00:28:19,764
They better hope
they're not uneven in there.

517
00:28:19,884 --> 00:28:22,371
I'm gonna blind 'em
with the laser, Shawn.

518
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:32,629
May we help you?

519
00:28:35,645 --> 00:28:37,385
Derek and Melanie Ford?

520
00:28:38,474 --> 00:28:41,632
Or should I say
"Soldiers Against Government"?

521
00:28:45,977 --> 00:28:48,396
You sure your father
doesn't want to come inside?

522
00:28:48,556 --> 00:28:50,774
He's clinically insane and a biter.

523
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,404
Sorry again about running
from you guys,

524
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:56,571
but when we saw the mercury cougar
in the driveway, we just figured

525
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:59,199
it was Eugene...
coming after us for revenge.

526
00:28:59,597 --> 00:29:00,792
Revenge for what?

527
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:03,865
He thinks
that we set him up to take the rap

528
00:29:03,985 --> 00:29:07,853
- for the police headquarters bombing.
- {\We know}He's been asking around town about us,

529
00:29:07,973 --> 00:29:09,793
trying to figure out our whereabouts.

530
00:29:09,954 --> 00:29:11,502
We thought he'd finally found us.

531
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,122
Well, don't you worry about that.
You help us with this investigation,

532
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:17,674
we will make sure the police
protect you from your old pal.

533
00:29:17,836 --> 00:29:19,032
Thank you.

534
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:22,052
Tell him everything, honey.

535
00:29:26,447 --> 00:29:29,379
After Eugene got arrested 30 years ago,
we freaked out,

536
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:31,430
and we stopped our radical ways.

537
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,723
We became soldiers for government.

538
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:35,839
We built this great life.

539
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:39,987
You have to believe us. We had
nothing to do with setting Eugene up.

540
00:29:40,107 --> 00:29:41,817
I mean, we were all brainwashed.

541
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,219
We were all caught up in the movement.

542
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:47,568
Do you know of anyone else
who would have wanted to set him up?

543
00:29:48,449 --> 00:29:50,230
Honey, are you okay?

544
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:54,493
I cut myself pretty good.

545
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:57,882
Excuse me. I'm gonna have
to go put something on this.

546
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:09,418
Sorry.

547
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:11,604
We should get going.

548
00:30:11,764 --> 00:30:14,126
Thank you for your cooperation.
And rest assured,

549
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:16,610
Eugene will not learn
of your whereabouts. Thanks again.

550
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,571
- Hope your finger feels better!
- Thank you!

551
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,906
Good news, pop!
The trail is hot again.

552
00:30:22,466 --> 00:30:24,367
Like I said, count me out.

553
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:27,579
Damn it, Dad, do you have to be
so prideful all the time?

554
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,388
So you made a mistake 30 years ago.
Nobody cares. Just get over it.

555
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:34,294
Not everybody's as comfortable
screwin' up as you are, kid.

556
00:30:34,454 --> 00:30:37,720
I'm comfortable 'coz my mistakes is the
only thing that was pointed out to me.

557
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,300
Here we go, here we go.
Would you put away the violin?

558
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,218
I pointed out the good stuff.

559
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:45,346
But usually, you were too busy bragging
and showing off to take notice.

560
00:30:45,842 --> 00:30:48,031
Enough. I'm sick of you two
fighting all the time.

561
00:30:48,151 --> 00:30:49,551
Listen, Mr. Spencer,

562
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:52,145
Shawn needs you on the case because,
frankly, you're old,

563
00:30:52,305 --> 00:30:54,520
and we were barely even alive
during the'70s.

564
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,512
And Shawn,
your dad needs you on the case

565
00:30:56,632 --> 00:30:58,443
because even though you can be annoying,

566
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:01,196
you actually have a brilliant idea
every now and then.

567
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:03,860
But you're too damn stubborn
to admit you need each other.

568
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,075
Now can we go, please?
Thank you.

569
00:31:07,454 --> 00:31:09,127
Is he always such a know-it-all?

570
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:11,164
- You don't know the half of it.
- Very preachy.

571
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,470
So tell me what you have.

572
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,754
- I think there's another SAG member{\ out there}.
- How do you know that?

573
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:20,934
Did you see Melanie when we asked{\ her}
if{\ there was} anyone{\ else} who'd want to set up Eugene?

574
00:31:21,054 --> 00:31:23,134
She cut herself right there,
right there on the spot.

575
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:25,798
No, maybe they were telling you
what they wanted you to know,

576
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,347
not what you needed to know.

577
00:31:27,507 --> 00:31:29,891
I think they're protecting somebody
from Eugene.

578
00:31:30,051 --> 00:31:32,110
But there were only three people
in the picture.

579
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,698
No, there was four.

580
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:36,022
The three of them
and whoever took the picture.

581
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:38,066
Maybe they're protecting an old mentor.

582
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,725
I'm pretty sure
that Eugene met Derek and Melanie

583
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:43,536
when they were all students
at Santa Barbara University.

584
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,215
Let's see if they shared
any professors or advisors or RAs.

585
00:31:47,335 --> 00:31:49,327
- RA... That's a thing, right?
- It is.

586
00:31:49,447 --> 00:31:50,537
Okay, let's do this.

587
00:31:50,863 --> 00:31:52,317
Back to undercover.

588
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:54,788
Got it. Thank you, Jules.

589
00:31:55,402 --> 00:31:57,715
All right, according to Juliet,

590
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:01,834
University records show that our
SAG members only shared one professor,

591
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:04,801
and that is Dr. Richard Colbert.

592
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:46,676
I think Eugene got here before we did.

593
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:50,970
I've been waiting for you guys.

594
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,282
Yeah, we got your call
when we were out on the open ocean

595
00:32:53,402 --> 00:32:55,294
chasing down our sea pirates at flank.

596
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:58,143
That's a nautical term
for maximum speed.

597
00:32:58,263 --> 00:33:00,633
We cordoned the private vessel
before they could club haul...

598
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:02,937
That's the nautical term
for evasive maneuver...

599
00:33:03,057 --> 00:33:05,458
- And make it to international waters.
- That sounds awesome.

600
00:33:05,578 --> 00:33:07,954
- What do modern sea pirates look like?
- We have no idea.

601
00:33:08,074 --> 00:33:10,291
{\Apparently, }Once you get three miles out,
it's out of our jurisdiction,

602
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:12,091
so the coast guard has us sequestered

603
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:14,203
to a tiny, windowless cabin
on the lubber deck.

604
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:17,259
Yeah, apparently that's a nautical term
for place they send you to puke.

605
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:20,143
- Had to wash my hair three times.
- Still sorry about that.

606
00:33:20,263 --> 00:33:21,460
Let's do this.

607
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:28,275
So, what do we have here?

608
00:33:28,886 --> 00:33:30,928
The deceased is one Dr. Richard Colbert.

609
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:34,432
Male, 60 years old,
professor of chemistry.

610
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:36,425
Apparently, he died from a lab accident

611
00:33:36,545 --> 00:33:39,145
involving poisonous hydrochloric
acid fumes.

612
00:33:39,305 --> 00:33:42,682
When will people ever learn that alcohol
and hydrochloric acid don't mix?

613
00:33:42,802 --> 00:33:44,400
Technically, they do.

614
00:33:44,681 --> 00:33:48,112
See, the hydrogen atoms in the acid
form a loose bond with the chlorine...

615
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:50,239
What the hell are you wearing?

616
00:33:51,685 --> 00:33:54,551
I'm gettin' some serious jive,
and it is fly.

617
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,102
I can see the struggle.
There's a rag on Colbert's face.

618
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,097
It was him who masterminded the bombing,
30 years ago.

619
00:34:04,217 --> 00:34:05,588
He set Eugene up.

620
00:34:05,966 --> 00:34:07,715
And eugene has murdered him...

621
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:09,550
In revenge.

622
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:13,714
But... Wait!

623
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:16,018
There's more.

624
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:22,146
The field is strong.

625
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:28,027
I am gettin' it.
And it is a bad mother...

626
00:34:28,187 --> 00:34:30,655
- Shut your mouth! I can dig it.
- I'm havin' a vision.

627
00:34:37,905 --> 00:34:39,455
It's a big birthday cake.

628
00:34:40,616 --> 00:34:41,999
- Make a wish!
- What?

629
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,461
Bomb.
Eugene's built another bomb!

630
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:48,719
He built it here in the lab!
That's how he's gonna exact his revenge

631
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,884
on the remaining members of SAG!
We've gotta stop him now!

632
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:56,973
That's all I got. The jive's over.
We should go before people explode.

633
00:35:14,984 --> 00:35:17,777
Found him lookin' around out back.
Must have hidden this under the house.

634
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,082
We got a bomb!

635
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:27,003
Which... hasn't been activated.

636
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,840
Call the bomb squad.

637
00:35:30,485 --> 00:35:33,426
Eugene, looks like you've been up
to your old tricks.

638
00:35:33,586 --> 00:35:35,762
I'm only here because
they called me saying

639
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:37,597
they were finally ready to come clean.

640
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:39,849
Invited guests don't go
snoopin' around the back.

641
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:42,143
I was just checking to see
if anybody was home.

642
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:44,269
- I swear!
- Save it for the trial.

643
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:46,481
You're under arrest
for the murder of Richard Colbert.

644
00:35:46,761 --> 00:35:47,885
Wait, wait!

645
00:35:48,452 --> 00:35:49,751
Colbert's dead?

646
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,520
And the attempted murder
of Derek and Melanie Ford.

647
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,697
Thank god you stopped him in time.

648
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:05,708
I cut myself pretty good.
I need to go put something on this.

649
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,443
Maybe they were telling you
what they wanted you to know,

650
00:36:08,563 --> 00:36:10,213
not what you needed to know.

651
00:36:12,848 --> 00:36:14,842
Lies, lies, lies!

652
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:16,044
Lies!

653
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:22,449
You two.

654
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:25,969
You were two young kids
in way over your head

655
00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:27,650
with the militant SAG

656
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,391
So you used Eugene
as a scapegoat, didn't you?

657
00:36:31,811 --> 00:36:34,190
Set him up to take the fall
for the police headquarters bombing

658
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,669
so you could make a clean break.

659
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:39,116
But then you heard he got out early,
and you were afraid he'd

660
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:41,536
he'd come track you down
and expose your criminal past.

661
00:36:41,904 --> 00:36:43,630
We know he's been asking {\around town }about us,

662
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,271
trying to figure out our whereabouts.

663
00:36:46,391 --> 00:36:47,625
We thought he'd{\ finally} found us.

664
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:49,544
Because of the four members of SAG,

665
00:36:49,704 --> 00:36:52,839
only two of you are doin'
okay for yourselves.

666
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,258
Eugene has lost 30 years,

667
00:36:55,418 --> 00:36:57,289
and he will be marked
as a criminal forever.

668
00:36:57,409 --> 00:37:00,096
And Dr. Colbert,
his drinking destroyed his career.

669
00:37:00,827 --> 00:37:02,018
But you two...

670
00:37:02,813 --> 00:37:04,912
Your life is picture-perfect.

671
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:07,517
And you would kill to protect it.

672
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:09,856
First, it was Dr. Colbert.

673
00:37:10,178 --> 00:37:12,360
His guilt-ridden conscience
and drunk mouth

674
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,955
would cause him to confess
everything to Eugene.

675
00:37:15,075 --> 00:37:16,628
And then the plan was simple.

676
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:18,197
Frame eugene for that murder,

677
00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:20,283
and then blow Eugene up

678
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:22,577
right along with all the traces
to your past

679
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:26,831
so you could move on
to a very bright, white pickety future.

680
00:37:27,308 --> 00:37:29,333
That's a preposterous theory.

681
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:31,085
- Preposterous!
- You have no proof.

682
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:32,253
Really?

683
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:35,229
What if I did somethin' like this?

684
00:37:40,713 --> 00:37:42,078
Spencer, what did you just do?

685
00:37:42,198 --> 00:37:46,017
In exactly one minute,
we will all be blown to smithereens.

686
00:37:46,243 --> 00:37:48,797
Or the people responsible
for making that bomb

687
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:50,426
will deactivate it.

688
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:52,690
Don't look at me. He's crazy.

689
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,233
I don't know how either.

690
00:37:54,513 --> 00:37:57,570
I demand that someone
disarm this bomb right now!

691
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,674
Arrest them.

692
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:22,088
Come on.

693
00:38:23,143 --> 00:38:24,158
Go.

694
00:38:26,736 --> 00:38:29,977
Spencer, I'd appreciate it in the future
if you just played with your own life.

695
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:31,604
Come on, lassie.

696
00:38:32,071 --> 00:38:34,857
If derek hadn't caved,
I would have just deactivated it myself.

697
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:35,900
Very easy.

698
00:38:36,145 --> 00:38:38,903
You just clip the red wire
and the green wire at the same time.

699
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,201
- There is no green wire.
- Really?

700
00:38:46,671 --> 00:38:49,101
In that case,
we all would have died.

701
00:38:50,963 --> 00:38:52,884
I am starving.

702
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:55,262
Who's up for fajitas?
My treat.

703
00:38:55,382 --> 00:38:58,334
Come on, you guys.
Not everybody would have died.

704
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:00,707
A couple of people would have lived.

705
00:39:00,827 --> 00:39:03,672
Those are the...
The odds are that at least one...

706
00:39:04,505 --> 00:39:06,467
Gus would have made it.

707
00:39:12,062 --> 00:39:15,019
It'll only take a few minutes for me
to finish my interview{\ with the independent}.

708
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:16,940
I still don't see
why you{\ have to} drag me into this.

709
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,404
I told you... They're gonna wanna hear
about my last case,

710
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,444
which was originally your case,
and without you,

711
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:24,360
- it wouldn't have been solved again.
- Interviews, press, hair...

712
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,663
Those are your things.

713
00:39:25,783 --> 00:39:27,459
A little attention isn't gonna kill you.

714
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:29,250
- One more thing.
- What?

715
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,467
Thank you.

716
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:46,060
As the bomb ticked{\ all the way} down to zero,
we held our ground.

717
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:50,188
And I looked those culprits in the eye,
and they knew that their time was up.

718
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,825
We don't seek out
the high-profile cases.

719
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:56,688
They just have a way of finding us.

720
00:39:57,402 --> 00:39:59,817
- Well, we should just show her.
- That's a great idea.

721
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,141
- You were there. You were here.
- I was here?

722
00:40:04,261 --> 00:40:06,137
No, we walked up,
and then they walked out.

723
00:40:06,257 --> 00:40:08,444
- They did?
- Yeah, they came out with the...

724
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,479
- So they had the bomb.
- No, they really did.

725
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,164
They didn't know it was a bomb.
