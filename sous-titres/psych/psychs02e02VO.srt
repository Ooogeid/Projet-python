1
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:10,851
Please don't touch it.

2
00:00:10,906 --> 00:00:11,989
Excuse me.

3
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:20,079
Gus, Gus, Gus!

4
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:21,529
Where's your project, Shawn?

5
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,237
- Did you even do it?
- My project?

6
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:24,287
Of course I did it.

7
00:00:24,403 --> 00:00:25,453
When?

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,498
When?

9
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:27,605
Last night.

10
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:28,652
It's right here.

11
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:30,597
This head
is to exact scale.

12
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:32,618
It took me three months
to make it.

13
00:00:32,696 --> 00:00:34,674
Yours took five minutes.

14
00:00:34,757 --> 00:00:36,817
No, Gus, you're totally wrong.

15
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:38,697
It took me a whole hour.

16
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:41,175
Check this out.

17
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:57,881
I hate you, Shawn.

18
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:13,700
Lompoc.

19
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:16,057
Okay, I did it.

20
00:01:21,072 --> 00:01:22,686
That's seven in row.

21
00:01:22,742 --> 00:01:24,739
Eight... the gas station guy
confessed last week!

22
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,526
Oh, I wouldn't
call myself a hero.

23
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:28,515
I'm just doing my job
just like all of you.

24
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,730
Hey, that's enough
goofing off.

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,089
Let's get back
to work, huh?

26
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:32,250
You too.

27
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:33,675
Ladies and gentlemen,

28
00:01:33,775 --> 00:01:34,968
Detective Lassiter!

29
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:36,848
Oh, stop it!

30
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,618
- Jules!
- Shawn.

31
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:45,284
- Is there a problem?
- With what?

32
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:47,370
With you. With me.
With the Chief.

33
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:49,502
She hasn't called
in a month.

34
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,944
Is she still mad about me
requisitioning the Segway?

35
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:53,189
You did that?

36
00:01:53,963 --> 00:01:55,057
No.

37
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:57,234
Well, I don't really

38
00:01:57,278 --> 00:02:00,438
have time right now,
but the short answer is

39
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:02,786
we just haven't really needed
any outside help.

40
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:04,460
Well, what's the long answer?

41
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:06,149
I mean,
throw a "but" in there

42
00:02:06,188 --> 00:02:07,614
and add something
about a dream

43
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:09,641
where you and I got thrown out
of a mattress showroom.

44
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:11,967
Detective Lassiter
is literally on fire.

45
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,249
What kind of fire
are we talking about?

46
00:02:13,304 --> 00:02:15,089
Michael Jackson
in the Pepsi commercial fire

47
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,044
or misusing the word
"literally" fire?

48
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,603
He's solved eight cases
in a row fire.

49
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:22,934
Nine... I just rembered
the DeShano case.

50
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:24,680
Hey, Shawn.
What's new?

51
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:26,238
You still doing
the psychic thing?

52
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:30,019
Is this some sort of
weird dream?

53
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:32,345
On the last two cases,
the first suspect

54
00:02:32,422 --> 00:02:33,925
Lassiter questioned confessed.

55
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:35,162
It's really magnificent.

56
00:02:35,262 --> 00:02:38,057
We are talking about
Carlton Lassiter, right?

57
00:02:38,096 --> 00:02:39,134
Yea high?

58
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:41,477
Bats ninth for the department
softball team?

59
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:42,940
Tenth.
We play with a rover.

60
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:45,648
Spencer, long time, no see.

61
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,000
Or is that no need?

62
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:50,397
I can't believe this.

63
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:52,584
Oh, believe it.
It's real.

64
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:54,264
They've done a preliminary
on the body down

65
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,491
at the marina, Detective.

66
00:02:55,524 --> 00:02:56,916
They're ready for you
at the scene.

67
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:59,109
Well, I would love
to stay and chat,

68
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:01,198
but duty does call.

69
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,844
Oh, Spencer, you look so sad.

70
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:07,857
Come on, we'll show you
how real cops do it.

71
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:10,864
No comeback?

72
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:14,455
Shawn, that's
slightly embarrassing.

73
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:18,957
Where'd you get that... suit?
The toilet store?

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,201
Good luck with this one,
Detective.

75
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,990
There's no identification.

76
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,379
Nobody's been reported missing
fitting this description.

77
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,723
Oh, Mr. Spencer.

78
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,612
I'm surprised
you didn't take the Segway.

79
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:45,087
She did know about that.

80
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:46,237
O'Hara just told me.

81
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:47,855
Traitor.

82
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:50,129
I'll deal with you later.

83
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:56,144
So what's the new
case we've got?

84
00:03:56,188 --> 00:03:58,188
A slight error
in grammar there, buddy.

85
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,531
Which part?
"Got. "

86
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:01,840
I came all the way down
from the office, Shawn.

87
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:03,933
Gus, don't be
a giant snapping turtle.

88
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:06,624
We'll have a case
in five minutes.

89
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:16,574
Nobody can explain
these puncture wounds.

90
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:18,563
We can't rule out
an animal attack.

91
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:22,817
No... no, there's nothing
in these waters

92
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:24,452
with a bite radius that large.

93
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,226
No, this is maybe
a... boating accident.

94
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:30,847
The wounds caused by
some machinery.

95
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,968
I can't really be sure
at this juncture.

96
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:35,299
Completely stumped.

97
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,351
You getting something,

98
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:38,478
Mr. Spencer?

99
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:40,939
Yes.

100
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:44,939
Yes, I am.

101
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:50,908
No, no, no! No, hold on.
Okay, I've got it.

102
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:51,860
The wound on the head

103
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,761
was caused by the edge
of a boat

104
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:56,912
when he fell in the water
unconscious.

105
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:58,636
And the wounds on the back,

106
00:04:58,693 --> 00:05:01,786
they were caused by a large
industrial crab trap.

107
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:05,593
Or a whale.

108
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:07,106
It definitely
could've been a whale.

109
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:09,234
Lost from his pod.

110
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,841
Separated, migrating
north or south.

111
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:14,877
And sees our man dead,
already floating up

112
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:15,772
above the surface.

113
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:19,159
Thinks it's a seal
and then... whale.

114
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:21,268
A whale?

115
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,379
What's your guy got?

116
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,147
Watch and learn, Jules.

117
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:25,197
Watch and learn.

118
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:26,356
Or...
Detective,

119
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:27,163
if you don't mind,

120
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:29,899
I'd like to see what
Mr. Spencer has to offer.

121
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:32,772
All right, look,

122
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,694
this is gonna be
a little rough, okay?

123
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:36,249
I didn't have time
for shading.

124
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:37,951
There's no forced perspective.

125
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:39,266
If I had really
had my druthers,

126
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,167
I would've done it
in charcoal.

127
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:41,465
You know what
I'm talking about.

128
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:43,266
Look, what I'm trying
to say is,

129
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,271
I'm not the artist
I'd like to be...

130
00:05:44,315 --> 00:05:45,371
Okay, Mr. Spencer, enough.

131
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,575
Can you or can you not
tell us who's responsible

132
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:48,320
for this man's death?

133
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:50,988
If I can present you
with a semi-accurate sketch

134
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:53,165
of the culprit, is that enough
to get us on this case?

135
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:54,969
Yes.

136
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:56,669
All right.

137
00:05:56,758 --> 00:05:57,907
The puncture wounds.

138
00:05:57,973 --> 00:05:58,957
They're the key.

139
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:01,675
Giving me the impression
that this crime could only

140
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:05,808
have been committed...
by this guy.

141
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,005
This guy here.

142
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:18,579
Excuse me.

143
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:20,339
What?

144
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,599
Chief?

145
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:24,896
Where are you off to?

146
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:27,657
So what, that's a no?

147
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,309
Gus!

148
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,093
This is not a boating accident.

159
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:02,179
You're mad.

160
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:04,057
No, I'm not mad. I'm happy.

161
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,687
I'm thrilled. I love looking
like an idiot.

162
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:08,145
Well, that explains
your shoes.

163
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:09,942
You almost closed down
our agency

164
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,283
with that little act
of yours, Shawn.

165
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:12,314
Me?

166
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,016
You're the one spending
all your extra time

167
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,508
at your little
"side project. "

168
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,503
You mean my real job?

169
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:19,479
Soon to be my only job?

170
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,346
Gus, you're panicking.
Don't panic.

171
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,203
Those bite marks are consistent
with a tyrannosaurus bite.

172
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:26,031
You know that.
Yes, I know that.

173
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:28,165
The hard way.

174
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:30,988
I was canned from the Wyoming
Natural History Museum

175
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:32,049
for that little shot.

176
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:34,656
The bruises from the teeth
didn't go away for a year,

177
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:35,766
but totally worth it.

178
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,673
It was my best
screensaver ever.

179
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:40,745
Gus, please, connecting
a dinosaur to this case

180
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:42,076
is the least of our worries.

181
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,899
Look, I can I stash
a toy dinosaur

182
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:44,805
in the window of the killer.

183
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,369
I can link him to a box
of Dino Bites or Fruity Pebbles.

184
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:52,518
I can play Six Degrees of Dinosaur
with you right now.

185
00:07:54,986 --> 00:07:57,273
You've never been in a movie
with Kevin Bacon

186
00:07:57,322 --> 00:07:58,494
or a Dilaposaurus, have you?

187
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:01,853
How about you play
Six Degrees of Kiss My Ass?

188
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,581
First of all, that sounds like
a totally disturbing game.

189
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:06,913
What's weird is that my guess
on the jaw radius

190
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:08,629
was actually spot on.

191
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:11,701
It almost seems to make sense.

192
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:14,606
So now you're getting on board
with your own joke theory?

193
00:08:14,672 --> 00:08:16,518
How are you gonna match
your bite radius

194
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:17,601
to the victim, Shawn?

195
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:20,252
Drag the body
to the Wyoming museum?

196
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:24,562
I can do you one better.

197
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:25,866
What?

198
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:28,021
I need to borrow
my dad's truck.

199
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:30,785
You coming or what?

200
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:32,943
That's clearly a no.

201
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:35,468
The one thing we can be sure of is

202
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:37,755
the cause of death
was not drowning.

203
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:40,832
Blunt force trauma
to the head was severe enough

204
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,158
to knock him unconscious.

205
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:44,777
More than likely he fell
from some sort of

206
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:47,605
a platform after
knocking himself on the head.

207
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,418
And this is how he ended up
in the water?

208
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:51,241
No, he landed
on something hard.

209
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:52,900
Dislocated a rib.

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,567
He has bruises consistent
with a six, seven,

211
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,716
or eight-foot fall.

212
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:58,893
My guess is that he landed
on something else

213
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:02,810
and ultimately expired
before tumbling into the water.

214
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:04,368
You know, this might be a leap,

215
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:06,279
but I would check
the offshore oil rigs.

216
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:08,401
See if any of them
are missing workers.

217
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,176
I'll make some calls.

218
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:11,736
Interesting, Detective.

219
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:12,835
Thanks, Chief.

220
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:15,072
This theory feels good.
Just makes sense.

221
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,508
The work boots, the odd
configuration of the wounds.

222
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:19,558
You know us, Ted.
It's worth a shot, right?

223
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,138
- We don't go out on limbs too often...
- Thanks, guys.

224
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:22,922
I just need
to measure something.

225
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:26,443
Oh, good!

226
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,070
You're all here.
Get ready to be shocked.

227
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:31,239
Can we get the sheet
off the dead guy, please?

228
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,833
Confirming the bite radius...

229
00:09:32,877 --> 00:09:34,982
No! Mr. Spencer...

230
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:37,101
Whoa, hey, hey, be careful.
This isn't mine.

231
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:39,803
Mr. Spencer, your antics
have always been a little...

232
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,600
let's say unorthodox.

233
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:43,302
But let me be as frank
as I can be

234
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:45,921
with my assessment
of your most recent behavior.

235
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:47,191
Seek help.

236
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:50,733
Chief, sometimes
you have to jump off a cliff.

237
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,059
You have to close your eyes.

238
00:09:52,114 --> 00:09:54,584
You have to unhook
your clip "chasses"...

239
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:56,574
Chassis?

240
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,949
Climbing thing...

241
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:03,049
and you have to leap.

242
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:04,651
Now I ask you, Chief...

243
00:10:04,762 --> 00:10:06,475
will you leap with me?

244
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:10,165
Are you thinking about
jumping off a cliff?

245
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,298
Maybe.

246
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:25,137
Dad!

247
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,986
I've brought the keys back.
Hello!

248
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:33,933
Okay, this is creepy.
Why is Gus here?

249
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,575
Why do you think, Shawn?

250
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:37,232
He's a hostage.

251
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:39,614
Perhaps I can shed
some light on that.

252
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,448
Two hostages.

253
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:44,032
Doug Devette is an old colleague
of mine from the force.

254
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:46,132
The Chief asked me
to have him drop by.

255
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:48,100
Why?

256
00:10:48,726 --> 00:10:51,212
Doug is the department
psychologist, Shawn.

257
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:53,599
What is this, some sort
of intervention?

258
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:54,726
Yeah, sort of.

259
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:57,743
We don't like to use the term
"intervention," Shawn.

260
00:10:58,193 --> 00:10:59,210
Gus?

261
00:10:59,265 --> 00:10:59,950
Don't look at me.

262
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,674
I'm here for the cupcakes.

263
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,518
Dad, I am not on drugs.

264
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:05,722
Oh, nobody thinks that, Shawn.

265
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,269
Well, I'm not completely
sure about that, Doug.

266
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:08,650
We're all just
a little concerned

267
00:11:08,716 --> 00:11:10,014
that you might be
stretching yourself

268
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:10,998
a bit too thin.

269
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:12,638
It wasn't my idea,
but he's right, Shawn.

270
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:14,080
You're acting like a nut job.

271
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:16,887
Just because I take
Gus' giant dinosaur

272
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,771
head down to a dead body
does not make me a nut job.

273
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,058
What?

274
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,796
You took my T-Rex?

275
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,177
My mom gave it to you?

276
00:11:25,238 --> 00:11:25,669
Gladly.

277
00:11:25,713 --> 00:11:28,376
She also gave me some pictures
you can pay me to not show

278
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:28,962
your next girlfriend.

279
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:29,768
What pictures?

280
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:31,149
The ones that document
your Terence Trent

281
00:11:31,205 --> 00:11:32,365
D'Arby phase.

282
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:34,844
Whatever, Shawn.

283
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,645
You took Danny Dino
to the police station?

284
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,562
No, Gus, give me some credit.

285
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,200
I took him to the morgue.

286
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,508
Good news.

287
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:45,436
Your specifications
were spot on.

288
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:50,900
Your father tells me you have
delusions of magical powers.

289
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:53,417
Delusions?
Really.

290
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:56,964
Doug, I'm employed as a psychic.

291
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:59,395
I've solved 18 cases this year.

292
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:01,637
I have business cards
and a personalized coffee mug

293
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:03,140
that backs up the whole thing.

294
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:06,074
I feel things about people.

295
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:12,571
You, for instance,
are color blind.

296
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,803
That's nothing
to be ashamed off.

297
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,523
You're also really stressed
about something.

298
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:28,002
College.

299
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:30,444
It can be very expensive, Doug.

300
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,002
Oh, that was good, Henry.

301
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,913
Doug, do not be a stooge.

302
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:36,764
Not a stooge, but in this
one case, he was right.

303
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:40,017
Knock at door.

304
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,932
Karen, do you mind?

305
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:44,258
We're in the middle
of an intervention here.

306
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:45,116
We don't have time for that.

307
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:46,283
But you're the one
who asked for this.

308
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:47,057
And I thank you, Henry,

309
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:48,244
but I'm afraid
that this can't wait.

310
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:49,774
We just got a break
in the case.

311
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:51,697
We just found out
the name of the dead man.

312
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:53,443
You want to tell him
who he is, Detective?

313
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,912
No.

314
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:58,711
His name was
Christopher Franzen.

315
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,631
He is a paleontologist.

316
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:07,469
A dinosaur hunter.

317
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,829
As expected.

318
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:11,619
Doug...

319
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:12,906
pleasure was all mine.

320
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:14,436
Oh, no, Shawn, mine.

321
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,800
We should get together.

322
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,109
All right, here's
what we know so far.

323
00:13:21,154 --> 00:13:24,347
A man, a paleontology professor,
washes ashore with wounds

324
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:25,551
specific to a dinosaur.

325
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:28,272
I don't think we can rule out
the possibility of island

326
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:30,515
somewhere in the Pacific
where dinosaurs do exist.

327
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,360
And have an appetite
for Jeff Goldblum.

328
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,186
I'm being serious, Shawn.

329
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,971
Well, look who's Mr. Onboard
and sounding like

330
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,023
a whacked wombat.

331
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:37,841
Then what is it?

332
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,908
I don't know.

333
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:41,490
It actually scares me
that my wild dinosaur reach

334
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,386
landed so close
to the bull's-eye.

335
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,226
This guy was possibly killed
by something dinosaur-related,

336
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,690
but it was probably a model
or something from

337
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:49,916
the archaeology department.

338
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,800
We'll have to spend
the better part

339
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,314
of the next 24 hours
sifting through

340
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:53,761
their entire collection
of artifacts.

341
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,967
And by "we" I mean mostly you.

342
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:03,800
This is all there is?

343
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,848
No. No, no, no.

344
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:06,754
This is just the big stuff.

345
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,972
We got the trilobites
in a shoebox,

346
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:11,823
but the shelf is kind of high.

347
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:15,443
You've got Pinhead, Chatterbox,
Surgeon, and Stitch

348
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,300
up there on a shelf?

349
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:18,123
Shawn, those are Cenobites.

350
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,500
Well, what are trilobites?

351
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,217
Fish fossils.

352
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,123
Oh, Gus, for my sake,
at least pretend like

353
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,841
you don't know this stuff
off the top of your head.

354
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:27,288
Do this move.

355
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:30,230
Trilo... trilobite?

356
00:14:30,263 --> 00:14:31,000
What... it'll help you!

357
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,671
I'm serious.

358
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,921
Look, Ethan, I can honestly say

359
00:14:33,954 --> 00:14:35,668
there were more
historically significant items

360
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,840
in the lost and found at the Taco
John's in Porterville.

361
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:40,287
Yeah.

362
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,226
Yeah, it's a little sad.

363
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,248
Word is the whole program
is going under.

364
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,655
You sure about that?

365
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,152
Look, Professor Franzen
would never really give us

366
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,041
a straight answer.

367
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:53,782
In fact, most nights he wasn't
around to give us any answers.

368
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,561
He was a pretty crappy advisor.

369
00:14:55,616 --> 00:14:57,727
And when he did show up,
he was late, tired,

370
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,207
completely disheveled.

371
00:14:59,251 --> 00:15:00,800
Nobody really trusted the guy.

372
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:03,417
Look, do not ever take
a class from him.

373
00:15:03,461 --> 00:15:04,450
He's dead.

374
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:05,732
Oh, yeah.

375
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:07,596
Then totally.

376
00:15:13,383 --> 00:15:15,360
Well, this sure was a dead end.

377
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,738
Yep, but at least we were
the first ones

378
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:19,252
to find the dead end.

379
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:21,845
Oh, come on!

380
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:24,453
He really is on fire.

381
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:26,131
Literally.

382
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,511
I don't get this.

383
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:32,361
The cops beat us
to the dead guy's house.

384
00:15:32,394 --> 00:15:34,527
I don't know how I feel
about the police department

385
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,600
being so proactive.

386
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:37,133
Feeling the heat?

387
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,990
What, do you think I'm afraid
of a little competition?

388
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:40,592
I know you're afraid
of competion.

389
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:42,497
Why else would you have
purposefully broken

390
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:43,868
the Battlezone at Pizza Royale?

391
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,083
Dude, you beat me once.

392
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:46,279
And only because you first

393
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:48,688
used the eye piece and then
revealed you had pinkeye.

394
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,775
Let's venture off
the beaten path.

395
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:06,696
What's wrong?

396
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:08,861
I'm just trying to figure out
what to do here,

397
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:10,717
since as a rule we don't
break and enter.

398
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,385
What do you mean
we don't break and enter?

399
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,054
The 2400 Motel.

400
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,986
The Hotel de la Cruz.

401
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:16,123
The spellmaster's box.

402
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:18,908
Yeah, but we really
shouldn't pick this lock.

403
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:20,532
You know I want
to pick that lock.

404
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:21,581
Yes, I do.

405
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:23,030
Watch out.

406
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,831
What are you, the lock whisper?

407
00:16:32,396 --> 00:16:34,606
Are you channeling
Michael Jackson?

408
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:36,647
Who heard the second click?

409
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:38,017
I heard the second click.

410
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:43,679
Really?

411
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,171
Come on.

412
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,708
I can't see anything.

413
00:16:56,763 --> 00:16:58,719
Oh, I got it, I got it.

414
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:04,084
Gus, that thing is
brighter than the sun.

415
00:17:04,117 --> 00:17:05,421
Think you just gave me glaucoma.

416
00:17:05,454 --> 00:17:07,741
You can't give someone
glaucoma.

417
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,042
Thank you.

418
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:16,111
This is better than the entire
university department.

419
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,146
It sure is.

420
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,955
And his digging equipment
is some heavy duty stuff.

421
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,248
Looks like some shovels
are missing.

422
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,274
Part of a portable light kit.

423
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:29,431
A lot of brushes.

424
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:35,639
And fine finishing equipment,
which I would assume

425
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:37,289
he was only using in the lab.

426
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:41,803
Dude, I got something.
What?

427
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:43,642
He was the worst
tic-tac-toe player

428
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:44,548
in the history of the world.

429
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:47,116
I'm investigating and you're
analyzing his doodles?

430
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,659
Doodles are the window
to the soul, Gus.

431
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,382
Or maybe that's the epiglottis.

432
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:54,352
Where's the uvula?

433
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:55,855
Lassiter's here.

434
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,060
That guy's like five minutes
behind us everywhere we go.

435
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:02,007
Don't sleep in the nude tonight.

436
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:14,300
Spencer.

437
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,180
Enjoying your time
riding my behind?

438
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:18,257
Definitely not in the nude.

439
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:20,251
This lock looks too high tech
for a backyard shed.

440
00:18:20,295 --> 00:18:21,873
We gotta find somebody
who can crack the code.

441
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:24,348
There's already someone
here who can do that.

442
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:27,183
That person... is me.

443
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:29,469
Well, make yourself useful.

444
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:33,346
I'll need you
to step back, please.

445
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:35,235
Give me some room to operate.

446
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:39,675
Further, please.

447
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:42,176
Further.

448
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,359
Jules, could you
help me out here?

449
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,657
Just get him back
onto the cobblestone.

450
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:47,612
That's good, that's good.

451
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:50,148
Thank you.

452
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:55,075
I am sensing
the first two digits.

453
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,957
What is it, 31?

454
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,106
Gus, help me out here.

455
00:19:00,117 --> 00:19:01,200
Come on, buddy.

456
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:04,570
You can have my
Tony Gwynn rookie. 25.

457
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:07,462
25!

458
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:10,987
Eight?

459
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,283
Three.

460
00:19:12,758 --> 00:19:13,786
Three!

461
00:19:14,998 --> 00:19:16,103
Four?

462
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:16,838
Two.

463
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,526
And... two.

464
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:20,876
There's one more.

465
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:22,800
Wait!

466
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,042
There's one more.

467
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:26,274
Nine.

468
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:40,404
That was amazing.

469
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:42,367
I'll give you that one.

470
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:47,259
Can't see a thing in here.

471
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,889
Oh, I've got it.

472
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,056
Wait, I'm sensing a light switch.

473
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:54,133
Tools are missing.

474
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:56,077
Good work, Detective.

475
00:19:57,392 --> 00:19:59,072
He had a blunt force
trauma.

476
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:00,961
That could be supplied
by one of these missing items.

477
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:04,876
Maybe this rock hammer
or this medium shovel.

478
00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:06,500
But where would they be?

479
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:08,077
The bed of his pickup.

480
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:10,453
It wasn't parked out front
or at the university.

481
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,012
We find that truck,
we find the murder weapon.

482
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,083
Let's go, O'Hara.

483
00:20:14,117 --> 00:20:15,332
Burning daylight.

484
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,576
Excuse us.

485
00:20:19,842 --> 00:20:21,466
Man, you missed the truck?

486
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:23,147
I'm not the psychic.

487
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:29,984
What?

488
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,119
Why would someone
frequent a fruit stand

489
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:36,086
that's over 50 miles away?

490
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,268
They like pomegranate?

491
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:51,342
Yeah, I know him.

492
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,919
He was my best customer.

493
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,219
Don't know his name.

494
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:56,843
But he comes by
every night before closing.

495
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,600
Did you ever see
which way he went?

496
00:20:59,019 --> 00:20:59,560
Yeah.

497
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:01,810
Always up the hill.

498
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:03,126
That's all I see.

499
00:21:03,402 --> 00:21:05,615
Although every once in a while

500
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:08,812
I see him come back down the hill
early in the morning.

501
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,240
Well, thank you very much.

502
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:12,101
Gus, you got anything else?

503
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:13,958
Yes, is that peach pie in the back?

504
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:14,670
Yeah.

505
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:36,311
Another dead end.

506
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:37,578
Let's turn around.

507
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:41,884
Hold on a second.

508
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:55,666
This looks like a place
someone's been sneaking into.

509
00:22:06,218 --> 00:22:06,980
What is this?

510
00:22:07,546 --> 00:22:09,427
Looks like some kind of farmland

511
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,633
or grazing plain.

512
00:22:10,928 --> 00:22:11,899
Oh, look at that.

513
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:15,000
It's like that movie.
The one with Sigourney Weaver.

514
00:22:15,452 --> 00:22:16,866
- Aliens?
- No.

515
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,771
- Alien.
- No.

516
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:19,878
Alien: Resurrection.

517
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,098
Gus, the one with the holes
and Shia LaBeouf.

518
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:23,501
They had holes in Shia LaBeouf?

519
00:22:24,102 --> 00:22:26,437
The holes are in the ground,
dude, like that.

520
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:28,974
And Jon Voight was walking
around all crazy.

521
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,130
Oh,Anaconda.

522
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,232
Yeah, never mind.

523
00:22:32,313 --> 00:22:33,199
Gorillas in the Mist?

524
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:35,334
- Death and the Maiden?
- No!

525
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,461
Half Moon Street?

526
00:22:36,498 --> 00:22:38,170
Just let it go.

527
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,561
I'll be damned.

528
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:45,606
What?!

529
00:22:45,962 --> 00:22:47,174
Somebody's shooting at us!

530
00:22:49,657 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, God! They're shooting!

531
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:52,424
We're gonna die!

532
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,198
Run, Gus!

533
00:22:53,383 --> 00:22:54,643
Gus, run like the wind!

534
00:22:54,717 --> 00:22:56,229
No... get... get up!

535
00:23:00,618 --> 00:23:02,499
Come on, get in the car!

536
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:03,950
Hurry up, Shawn!

537
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,711
Start it, start it!

538
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:07,558
Go, go, go!

539
00:23:07,923 --> 00:23:10,419
Dude, look at the road
while you're driving!

540
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:12,527
- I'm staying down for safety.
- He was shooting

541
00:23:12,528 --> 00:23:13,831
directly into the air, Gus.

542
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:15,465
Bullets go up. They have to come down.

543
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:17,784
Do you know what the trajectory
would have to be for that to happen?

544
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:19,444
Don't you dare argue physics with me.

545
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:21,498
Not while we're in the process
of almost being killed.

546
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:32,403
Didn't you see the
"Trespassers Will Be Shot" sign?

547
00:23:34,118 --> 00:23:35,182
Oh, yeah.

548
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:36,590
It totally said that.

549
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:38,172
My bad.

550
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,913
Mr. Spencer, if you have any
substantial information concerning

551
00:23:45,914 --> 00:23:48,924
the Christopher Franzen case,
please get on with it.

552
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:50,708
I've got something.

553
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:52,875
It's a cluck.

554
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:54,154
A cluck?

555
00:23:58,896 --> 00:23:59,990
Actually there's two.

556
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,048
Two clucks.

557
00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:02,570
A cluck-cluck here.

558
00:24:07,456 --> 00:24:10,444
A bawk-bawk... there.

559
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:12,599
Here a bawk.
There a...

560
00:24:12,721 --> 00:24:13,164
Cluck?

561
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,441
Everywhere a bawk-baaawk.

562
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:17,941
Let me guess. You have a name.

563
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,068
MacDonald, perhaps?

564
00:24:20,117 --> 00:24:22,171
No. No, it's a farm.

565
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:23,567
With a farmer. An old farmer.

566
00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:25,869
Farmer... Shooty Pants.

567
00:24:26,456 --> 00:24:27,022
That's a nickname.

568
00:24:27,023 --> 00:24:29,226
- I don't think that's his actual handle.
- I've got it.

569
00:24:29,383 --> 00:24:31,237
Lassiter found
the paleontologist's truck.

570
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:32,811
- You helped.
- I did help.

571
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:33,794
It was his hunch.

572
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:36,009
It was down at the old marina.
I just had a feeling.

573
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:39,015
I also found the prints of a certain
grad student named Ethan Robinson

574
00:24:39,016 --> 00:24:42,494
along with a stack of letters from said
grad students demanding the professor

575
00:24:42,495 --> 00:24:43,843
stop ruining his life.

576
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,703
We're sending a car over
to pick him up.

577
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:49,201
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting your trance?

578
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,829
I don't buy it.

579
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:51,604
Which part?

580
00:24:51,817 --> 00:24:54,559
The damning evidence
or the murder weapon?

581
00:24:54,991 --> 00:24:58,153
There's more going on in
this guy's life. Chief, I'm sensing...

582
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,281
digging.

583
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,390
Yeah, the archaeology
department was going under.

584
00:25:05,391 --> 00:25:06,705
He was trying to make a big discovery.

585
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:08,673
Put him on the map, get more funding.

586
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:09,822
The farm.

587
00:25:09,935 --> 00:25:11,472
I can see the name of the farm.

588
00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:13,056
It's Wallll...

589
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:15,762
Wall...

590
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:20,900
Walker Farms. Yeah, we got that lead
off the phone records... Yesterday.

591
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:23,305
Apparently our victim made
a series of phone calls

592
00:25:23,306 --> 00:25:26,396
to the farmer trying to buy some
of his land, but it wasn't for sale.

593
00:25:26,517 --> 00:25:28,558
Farmer was forthcoming, cooperative.

594
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:29,713
Definitely not a suspect.

595
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,918
Anything else?

596
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,863
I have to say,
you have been very through.

597
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:36,261
We're just doing what
any good cops would do.

598
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:47,707
- Shawn, what are you doing?
- Yeah, what are we doing, Shawn?

599
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:50,830
- I need to borrow some tools.
- What kind of tools?

600
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:53,669
Digging tools. A little excavation
project we got going on.

601
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,514
- Are you still on that dinosaur thing?
- We're still on that dinosaur thing?

602
00:25:56,581 --> 00:25:59,483
What, is there an echo in here?
Yes, we're still on the dinosaur thing.

603
00:25:59,565 --> 00:26:02,622
We step foot on the far end
of this guy Walker's farm in Ojai

604
00:26:02,623 --> 00:26:04,417
and he starts blasting us
with buckshot.

605
00:26:04,503 --> 00:26:06,959
We know our dead guy was there
every night leading up to his death,

606
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,147
digging around the periphery
of this property.

607
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:10,936
No, Shawn, wait.

608
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:12,499
I don't want you borrowing my tools.

609
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:14,562
Oh, Gus will leave
his class ring as collateral.

610
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:15,336
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will.

611
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:16,262
- No, I won't.
- Sure you will.

612
00:26:16,297 --> 00:26:16,862
No, I won't.

613
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:18,092
I can't support this.

614
00:26:18,322 --> 00:26:19,958
Well, there's a shocker.

615
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:21,507
You not being supportive.

616
00:26:21,543 --> 00:26:22,552
Would you shut up and listen?

617
00:26:22,553 --> 00:26:25,701
I'm saying I can't support you going
somewhere where you could get shot.

618
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:28,410
What, are you...
Are you worried about me?

619
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:30,782
Shawn, I've been worried about you
since you were three years old

620
00:26:30,783 --> 00:26:33,044
and started eating your own toenails.

621
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:34,708
Well,

622
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:36,020
Dad, I'll be fine, okay?

623
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:37,521
We're not gonna go
anywhere near the house.

624
00:26:37,522 --> 00:26:40,743
And if it'll make you feel any better,
I will stand behind Gus the entire time.

625
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:41,571
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.

626
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,764
- No, you won't.
- Oh, yes, I will.

627
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:43,194
You want to bet?

628
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:44,242
I don't like it.

629
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:45,679
It doesn't feel right.

630
00:26:46,511 --> 00:26:47,545
I know feelings.

631
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,035
Pardon me? Did...

632
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:52,088
Did you just say... "I know feelings"?

633
00:26:58,015 --> 00:26:59,023
Perfect.

634
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,351
This will be easy.

635
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:02,174
Oh, there's a pattern here.

636
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,067
Those guys dig with a reason.

637
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,297
How do you know that?

638
00:27:05,503 --> 00:27:09,130
Gus, I worked at the museum for almost
an entire weekend before I got canned.

639
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,648
<i>He was the worst tic-tac-toe player
in the history of the world.</i>

640
00:27:14,528 --> 00:27:15,536
Wait a second.

641
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:18,173
Those weren't tic-tac-toe boards.

642
00:27:18,174 --> 00:27:19,858
Those were all the places he'd dug.

643
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,389
There were like 25 Xs.

644
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:22,806
No way he scored that often.

645
00:27:22,928 --> 00:27:24,306
The Xs were misses.

646
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:27,246
In this case, "O" marks the spot.

647
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:39,354
And that's the "O."

648
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,753
This is the only hole
filled by a bulldozer.

649
00:27:51,184 --> 00:27:54,101
No self-respecting paleontologist
would use a bulldozer.

650
00:27:55,793 --> 00:27:56,814
Why do you know that?

651
00:27:57,023 --> 00:27:58,166
Because, Shawn, if you use a bull...

652
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:01,007
- Gus, I don't actually want to know.
- Then don't ask.

653
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,876
This shouldn't take long. Grab a shovel.

654
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,086
And keep an eye out for that farmer.

655
00:28:16,143 --> 00:28:19,214
- How you doing on your side?
- Good, solid.

656
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:21,071
I'm holding up.

657
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,124
- Shawn!
- What?

658
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:26,491
I'm keeping watch.
That's how the other guy died.

659
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,438
What, you're not concerned?

660
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:33,977
All right, I get it!

661
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:36,129
It's my turn.

662
00:28:42,172 --> 00:28:43,901
This is the end of the loose dirt.
Be careful.

663
00:28:50,454 --> 00:28:51,523
This is weird.

664
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:53,908
What, that there's rocks in the ground?

665
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,462
These aren't rocks.

666
00:28:57,177 --> 00:28:58,402
These are fossils.

667
00:28:58,698 --> 00:29:01,293
But they've been processed,
finished off, residue,

668
00:29:01,294 --> 00:29:02,375
rocks chipped away.

669
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:04,766
Stuff you would normally do in a lab.

670
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,004
Franzen found something.

671
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:10,888
Why wouldn't he just take it out

672
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:13,705
and do the work in the lab
where it should be done?

673
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:17,425
Unless...

674
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:19,688
Unless it was too big to move.

675
00:29:20,401 --> 00:29:23,487
Oh, dude, I'm gonna get the leaf blower.

676
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,666
You brought a leaf blower?

677
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:41,875
You gotta be kidding me.

678
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,133
I just discovered a dinosaur.

679
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:53,421
Filling that hole was
the worst idea ever.

680
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:55,969
It had to be done, Gus.

681
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,711
We have to save it for when
we unmask Franzen's killer.

682
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,616
I still don't get it.

683
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:04,199
He was on the trail of
a fossil graveyard.

684
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,148
It lead him right to Deacon Farms.

685
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:08,788
Farmer wouldn't let him
dig on the land, so

686
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:11,629
he takes matters into his
own hands after hours.

687
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:14,457
But why wouldn't the farmer let him dig?

688
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:16,435
Maybe he didn't want his farm disturbed.

689
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:21,336
A dig like that is worth
millions to a land owner.

690
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:24,166
And the fossils I discovered
weren't even on crop land.

691
00:30:24,226 --> 00:30:25,234
You discovered?

692
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:27,369
Don't try to take away
my dinosaur discovery, Shawn.

693
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,212
I wouldn't dream of it.

694
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:30,622
I'm sorry. It was all you.
I'm very proud of you.

695
00:30:31,444 --> 00:30:33,571
Don't you think once
they unearth that thing

696
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:36,566
there would be a swarm of people
crashing in from all over the world?

697
00:30:36,684 --> 00:30:38,307
Why didn't he just lease the land?

698
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:39,718
I don't get it.

699
00:30:40,813 --> 00:30:43,346
- I've got an idea.
- What?

700
00:30:43,739 --> 00:30:44,809
Let's ask him.

701
00:30:44,987 --> 00:30:45,995
What?!

702
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,307
We're pretty sure we just found
a cold-blooded murderer,

703
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:50,311
and you want to go to his house
and ask him about it?

704
00:30:50,397 --> 00:30:51,885
We can ask nicely.
No!

705
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:54,421
All right, all right.
We come up with a cover story.

706
00:30:55,011 --> 00:30:56,065
We're vacuum salesmen.

707
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:57,122
No...

708
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:58,635
Traveling gypsies.

709
00:30:58,636 --> 00:30:59,955
No, no, no!

710
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:02,201
We'll do Of Mice and Men.

711
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:04,133
- I'm Lennie.
- No.

712
00:31:04,182 --> 00:31:07,790
"George, you said that I could
take care of those rabbits, George."

713
00:31:07,852 --> 00:31:08,319
Shawn.

714
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,780
"And later on you're gonna
cook those beets. "

715
00:31:10,853 --> 00:31:11,370
Shawn!

716
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:12,527
"Beets make me go... "

717
00:31:12,712 --> 00:31:13,732
No Lennie.

718
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:17,009
Gus, you know how long
I've been waiting to pull out my Lennie?

719
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:20,512
No, Shawn, we do the National
Paleontology Society thing as agreed.

720
00:31:20,513 --> 00:31:22,392
And we keep it very, very simple.

721
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:24,569
It's not as much fun as
whipping out my Lennie.

722
00:31:25,262 --> 00:31:26,530
And why are we stopping here?

723
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,955
Have you tried these peaches?

724
00:31:30,365 --> 00:31:31,367
You're back.

725
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:32,437
Yes, sir, we are.

726
00:31:32,556 --> 00:31:33,860
We're addicted to your citrus.

727
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,041
Peaches aren't citrus, Shawn.
They're stone fruit.

728
00:31:36,117 --> 00:31:37,833
- It's the same thing.
- No, not the same thing.

729
00:31:37,914 --> 00:31:40,271
They have pits.
Peaches, cherries, plums, and apricots.

730
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:43,901
I can't do this with you right now.
Does your fruit come from Walker Farms?

731
00:31:44,178 --> 00:31:47,067
Oh, no. We grow on our own
little parcel of land.

732
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:50,943
Deacon Walker's farm used to be
a supplier of ours years ago,

733
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:53,464
but they don't grow nearly
as much as they used to.

734
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:57,354
Thank you so much for your information.

735
00:31:57,355 --> 00:32:00,846
If you have a moment, my friend and I
would like to buy every peach on that truck.

736
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:02,224
Including the one you're eating.

737
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:12,102
You sure you don't want
to do Of Mice And Men?

738
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:14,932
You so much as slur one word,
I'll give you an Indian burn so hot

739
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,368
your socks will catch fire.

740
00:32:16,422 --> 00:32:17,516
"Indian burn. "

741
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:19,658
I haven't been threatened
with that this millennium.

742
00:32:19,683 --> 00:32:21,306
Take a shot if your ulna feels safe.

743
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,999
I don't think the ulna's in the forearm.

744
00:32:24,288 --> 00:32:25,236
Trust me, it is.

745
00:32:26,058 --> 00:32:28,812
- How can you Indian burn a bone?
- Stop analyzing my threat.

746
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,417
- Get it right.
- I got it right.

747
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,393
- Deacon Walker?
- Sullivan Walker.

748
00:32:33,803 --> 00:32:35,340
Is Deacon Walker home?

749
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:36,913
There is no Deacon Walker.

750
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:38,618
That's confusing.

751
00:32:40,662 --> 00:32:42,457
I've got nothing.
Gus?

752
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:45,074
Then why name the farm
Deacon Walker Farms?

753
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,706
Because it used to be called
Deacon Walker.

754
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:48,157
Roger Deacon was my partner.

755
00:32:48,158 --> 00:32:49,116
He's not anymore.

756
00:32:49,984 --> 00:32:51,262
That cleans it up nicely.

757
00:32:51,312 --> 00:32:53,058
- Maybe we come in?
- No.

758
00:32:53,107 --> 00:32:54,090
What do you want?

759
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:56,414
We're from the National
Paleontological Society...

760
00:32:56,488 --> 00:32:57,398
Not interested.

761
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:01,983
Clearly he's not interested.

762
00:33:06,557 --> 00:33:07,504
We would like to make you

763
00:33:07,505 --> 00:33:10,086
a very sizeable offer
on a very small portion of your...

764
00:33:18,969 --> 00:33:21,022
Hello, my name is Lennie.

765
00:33:21,023 --> 00:33:22,122
I like to...

766
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,660
You think he'd open up
if we knocked again?

767
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:36,106
I'm glad it only took us
an hour to get up here.

768
00:33:36,178 --> 00:33:37,764
Not like I wasted a whole day.

769
00:33:40,441 --> 00:33:42,114
Franzen dug up here too?

770
00:33:53,634 --> 00:33:54,644
No, he didn't.

771
00:33:55,085 --> 00:33:57,335
These are all new and
dug with a bulldozer.

772
00:33:57,448 --> 00:33:58,505
A real paleontologist...

773
00:33:58,554 --> 00:34:01,112
would never use such an indelicate tool.
I got it.

774
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:04,697
- So our farmer's been digging too.
- Right.

775
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:09,101
But if the gold mine's out there,
why is he digging over here?

776
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:16,578
It's my dad.

777
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:18,366
Think he wants his leaf blower back?

778
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,328
Shawn?

779
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:23,529
Shawn, you're not anywhere
near that farmhouse, are you?

780
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,255
Dad, how dare you? Of course not.

781
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,509
Good.
Stay away, Shawn.

782
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,885
I know where I rember that farm.

783
00:34:27,886 --> 00:34:30,898
Deacon Walker Farm.
I was up there about 20 years ago.

784
00:34:30,953 --> 00:34:33,302
A girl reported that
her boyfriend went missing.

785
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:34,581
Roger Deacon.

786
00:34:34,685 --> 00:34:36,308
He was a partner in the farm.

787
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:37,747
He was never found, Shawn.

788
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:39,009
Never found?

789
00:34:39,058 --> 00:34:41,775
That's right, the farmer claimed he
went back to England or some nonsense.

790
00:34:41,776 --> 00:34:43,989
The point is, we never found out
where he went.

791
00:34:44,591 --> 00:34:46,121
I think I might know where he is.

792
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,179
Where?

793
00:34:47,596 --> 00:34:49,505
- I might be looking at him.
- Shawn!

794
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,562
Gotta go.

795
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:52,762
Shawn!
God...

796
00:34:53,794 --> 00:34:55,331
- Dude.
- What?

797
00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:01,256
It now appears a lot of our
evidence is circumstantial.

798
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,520
We're checking the grad
student's alibi, but...

799
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:05,291
I'm not as confident
as I like to be.

800
00:35:05,348 --> 00:35:07,616
- Shawn Spencer's on line one.
- What does he want?

801
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:10,357
He wants us to go meet him
in the Ojai Valley somewhere.

802
00:35:10,418 --> 00:35:12,214
We're in the middle
of the Franzen case.

803
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:13,395
I told him that.

804
00:35:13,493 --> 00:35:16,210
He guarantees that in ten minutes
he can solve the case,

805
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:19,677
nab the killer, close an additional
unsolved murder, and...

806
00:35:21,354 --> 00:35:22,559
And what?

807
00:35:23,715 --> 00:35:25,203
Unearth a dinosaur.

808
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:28,264
Well... I'm curious.

809
00:35:37,766 --> 00:35:41,946
This is as far as my property goes.
That's all there is.

810
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:45,489
Well, I've answered
all your questions, Detective.

811
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:47,468
What more do you want from me?

812
00:35:47,931 --> 00:35:50,541
- I'm not entirely sure, sir.
- We just have one more person

813
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:52,053
we need you to talk to.

814
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:56,015
Lennie?

815
00:35:56,826 --> 00:35:57,835
Lennie?

816
00:35:57,884 --> 00:35:59,052
Don't even ask.

817
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,224
My name is not Lennie, Mr. Walker.

818
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:03,544
But if it were,

819
00:36:03,545 --> 00:36:05,349
- I would've been amazing.
- No, you wouldn't have.

820
00:36:05,448 --> 00:36:06,598
Would've brought tears, Gus.

821
00:36:06,689 --> 00:36:07,700
Guys, the point?

822
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,003
The truth is...

823
00:36:10,004 --> 00:36:11,159
I'm a psychic.

824
00:36:11,474 --> 00:36:13,342
I work for the SBPD.

825
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:14,772
And the mystic vibrations

826
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,120
of the sea have brought me here

827
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:20,550
to solve not one,
but two murders.

828
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:21,998
You're a what?

829
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,981
Christopher Franzen was
a persistent annoyance, huh?

830
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,222
He couldn't help it.

831
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:27,990
His department was going under.

832
00:36:28,033 --> 00:36:30,133
He was desperate to find
something significant

833
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,669
to save his career.

834
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:34,768
And he knew that your property
held the key.

835
00:36:34,802 --> 00:36:36,840
But you wouldn't let him dig.

836
00:36:36,957 --> 00:36:39,399
You couldn't let him dig.

837
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:42,166
So he did what any
self-respecting paleontologist

838
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,652
on the verge of a nervous
breakdown would do.

839
00:36:44,814 --> 00:36:46,715
He dug anyway.

840
00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:48,792
Secretly.

841
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:50,068
Under the blanket of night.

842
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,107
And into the early morning.

843
00:36:52,217 --> 00:36:57,333
And he dug, and he dug,
and he found something.

844
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:07,072
And that's when you found him.
You knew the magnitude

845
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:08,254
of the find.

846
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,648
Once word got out,
you'd never be able to keep

847
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,406
the rest of the world
from digging here too.

848
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:14,055
And you couldn't have
the rest of the world

849
00:37:14,091 --> 00:37:15,682
digging here either,
could you?

850
00:37:15,725 --> 00:37:16,775
Shawn!

851
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:18,544
Dad?

852
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:19,538
What are you doing here?

853
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:21,078
I was worried.

854
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,870
About my tools.

855
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,788
What?

856
00:37:24,832 --> 00:37:26,522
If I had known you were
finally smart enough

857
00:37:26,555 --> 00:37:27,760
to bring some backup,
I wouldn't have had

858
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:28,577
to come up here, Shawn.

859
00:37:28,611 --> 00:37:30,909
Shawn, will you tell them
why Walker wouldn't let him dig?

860
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:32,499
Roger Deacon.

861
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,354
Deacon is buried
on the property!

862
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,300
Dad!

863
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:39,125
Dad, you just blew
the big reveal.

864
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,133
You already mentioned
his name, Shawn.

865
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,889
No, Deacon
was the partner

866
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:44,400
Walker killed 20 years ago.

867
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:46,649
- Hey, now wait a minute here...
- He what now?

868
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,113
Yeah, he killed Deacon
and he buried him

869
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:52,421
somewhere on the farm
and he can't rember where.

870
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:54,409
Isn't that right,
Farmer Shooty Pants?

871
00:37:54,454 --> 00:37:56,951
I don't have to stand here
and take this.

872
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,677
No, actually you do.

873
00:37:58,787 --> 00:38:00,710
What does this have to do
with Christopher Franzen?

874
00:38:00,754 --> 00:38:02,798
He killed Franzen when he caught
him standing above his

875
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:05,700
dinosaur skull discovery,
sending him flying right into

876
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:07,605
the teeth of the dinosaur.

877
00:38:07,627 --> 00:38:08,997
But he couldn't bury him here.

878
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:10,909
No, no, no,
he had called the farm.

879
00:38:10,942 --> 00:38:12,401
He had snooped around the farm.

880
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,444
There was a trail to the farm.

881
00:38:13,455 --> 00:38:16,417
No, he had to dump him somewhere
where there'd be no forensics.

882
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:19,099
Like the ocean.

883
00:38:19,388 --> 00:38:23,278
Just let the salt water clean
the corpse and wash it ashore.

884
00:38:23,311 --> 00:38:24,836
And the murder scene.

885
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,278
Well, he hopped on
his handy bulldozer

886
00:38:27,311 --> 00:38:29,099
and filled the hole.

887
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,438
I'm getting a bad feeling
about your streak.

888
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:34,302
You too, huh?

889
00:38:34,571 --> 00:38:36,191
I think I need a lawyer.

890
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:37,445
I think you're right.

891
00:38:37,468 --> 00:38:38,550
Put your hands
behind your back.

892
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:39,735
- What?
- You heard me.

893
00:38:39,757 --> 00:38:40,802
You still haven't answered
the question

894
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:42,504
why he dug all the holes
around the house, Shawn.

895
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:45,485
Dad, that's the finale.

896
00:38:45,552 --> 00:38:48,010
That's why I don't invite you
to these things.

897
00:38:49,472 --> 00:38:52,593
He was looking
for Deacon's body.

898
00:38:52,638 --> 00:38:53,676
Whatever.

899
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:54,957
Are we done here, Mr. Spencer?

900
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,648
No, we're not done.

901
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:58,941
For my final demonstration...

902
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,697
I will now...
discover a dinosaur.

903
00:39:03,752 --> 00:39:05,300
Shawn!

904
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:09,705
Actually... Gus will discover
a dinosaur.

905
00:39:10,294 --> 00:39:11,620
Wait a second.

906
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:13,426
You just want me
to dig this hole.

907
00:39:13,471 --> 00:39:14,603
I do not.

908
00:39:14,703 --> 00:39:16,172
I'm not falling
for that, Shawny boy.

909
00:39:16,205 --> 00:39:17,360
You dig it.

910
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:19,183
I'll take credit
for the discovery.

911
00:39:19,216 --> 00:39:20,945
Oh, no, you won't.
Give me that shovel.

912
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:22,190
It's too late.

913
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:23,560
You blew it.
What?!

914
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:25,040
And whoever discovers it
gets to name it.

915
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:26,333
I'm naming him Zippy.

916
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:27,880
Or Chompy.

917
00:39:27,913 --> 00:39:30,692
Zippy the Dinosaur,
discovered by psychic

918
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:32,239
paleo-sleuth Shawn Spencer!

919
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:34,239
Give me this shovel,
Shawn!

920
00:39:45,698 --> 00:39:47,311
Killed by a dinosaur.

921
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:49,000
And he's right.

922
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:50,779
It was an actual dinosaur.

923
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,249
Technically, it's the fall

924
00:39:52,293 --> 00:39:53,420
that killed him.

925
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:54,669
Not helping.

926
00:39:56,243 --> 00:39:57,669
Who am I kidding?
I am doomed.

927
00:39:57,707 --> 00:39:59,862
I am never gonna suspect
an extinct creature.

928
00:39:59,906 --> 00:40:01,044
How can I compete with that?

929
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:02,138
You don't have to compete.

930
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:04,812
O'Hara, I am physically incapable
of pointing the finger

931
00:40:04,856 --> 00:40:08,137
at a dragon or a leprechaun
or the Loch Ness Monster.

932
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,859
I quit. I'm gonna donate
my badge to charity.

933
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:13,985
It was a good run, Carlton.
All streaks have to end.

934
00:40:14,018 --> 00:40:16,172
Lou Boudreau fielded
the ball cleanly.

935
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,590
You have to let it go.

936
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,819
Who the hell is Lou Boudreau?

937
00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:22,702
He recorded the out that ended
DiMaggio's hit streak.

938
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:23,718
Don't you watch baseball?

939
00:40:23,762 --> 00:40:24,713
Of course I watch baseball.

940
00:40:24,746 --> 00:40:25,784
I just don't know meaningless

941
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:27,784
- facts from 75 years ago.
- 66.

942
00:40:27,874 --> 00:40:29,244
You disturb me.

943
00:40:31,908 --> 00:40:32,935
Do you need a hug?

944
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:34,720
Oh, what do I look like?

945
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:42,529
Yeah, I'll take the hug.

946
00:40:45,424 --> 00:40:47,274
Okay, thanks.
Okay.

947
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,144
Oh, come on, you guys.

948
00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:57,497
We're still doing
this intervention thing?

949
00:40:57,601 --> 00:40:59,490
Yes, yes, Shawn,
we are.

950
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:02,651
Son, you have no sense
of responsibility.

951
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:05,612
And lately you've been
purposefully putting yourself

952
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:07,501
in a severe amount
of unnecessary danger.

953
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:09,973
On top of which, you are
constantly belittling

954
00:41:10,018 --> 00:41:11,330
the good work of...
Actually, Henry,

955
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,202
I stretched the truth a bit.

956
00:41:13,246 --> 00:41:14,958
This isn't about Shawn.

957
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:17,704
- This is about you.
- What?

958
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:21,163
Can we talk about your obsessive
need for control?

959
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,566
You come into my house,
Devette.

960
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:25,096
You lie to me?!

961
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:26,474
Let's try to be rational.

962
00:41:26,507 --> 00:41:29,894
Did you really drive all the
way up to Ojai just to crash

963
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:31,739
Shawn's crowning moment?

964
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:33,473
Get out.

965
00:41:33,683 --> 00:41:35,015
Henry, we're here for you.

966
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,385
- At least listen.
- Out now.

967
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:39,400
Get out!

968
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,031
Out!

969
00:41:42,406 --> 00:41:43,567
I'd like to start.

970
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:46,661
When I was about seven, he...
