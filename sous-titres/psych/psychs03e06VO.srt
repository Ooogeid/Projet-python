1
00:00:01,538 --> 00:00:05,008
- How can you be sure it's down there?
- I can feel it in my bones, Gus.

2
00:00:05,387 --> 00:00:08,041
All great oil wildcatters
have that ability.

3
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:10,263
Me... getty,

4
00:00:10,782 --> 00:00:11,745
clampett,

5
00:00:12,217 --> 00:00:13,555
crisco and wesson.

6
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:15,975
But your dad told us
never to dig in the yard.

7
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:18,980
My dad doesn't understand
the concept of taking risks.

8
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,876
All we have to do is find the oil,

9
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:23,299
and that'll show him.

10
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:28,546
Let's say we do find oil.

11
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:31,493
- What happens then?
- All of our dreams come true.

12
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,196
I'll be rich, and you'll work for me.

13
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:54,659
- What the hell's going on here?
- Hey, dad.

14
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,352
We were prospecting for oil.
How was your day?

15
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:01,671
All right, there's grass seed
and duct tape in the garage.

16
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,900
I want this yard exactly as it was.

17
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,859
I don't care if it takes you both
all night, you understand?

18
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:20,546
You're bunching up over there!
Let's go!

19
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,358
Move that pipe. Let's go!

20
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:25,468
Bring those forks in through here.

21
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:26,923
Watch it now. Watch 'em.

22
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:28,981
Easy on the tongs.

23
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,162
Easy on the tongs.

24
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:35,060
Don't break those chains!

25
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:38,120
You two are bunching up over there.
Let's move that pipe.

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,102
Let's go!

27
00:01:43,318 --> 00:01:44,940
McCloud, watch that lift.

28
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,826
Check your line, Aldridge.

29
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,192
Hey, you!

30
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:53,341
That's no man's land.
Get away from there!

31
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:54,993
Hey, buddy!

32
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:56,536
I'm talking to you.

33
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,127
Clear the area.

34
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:03,217
Don't think
I'm not gonna write you up.

35
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:33,189
Great, I'm missing a huge symposium
on new frontiers in medical treatment,

36
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:36,159
- and I don't even know what for.
- What is that? The fungus one?

37
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:40,288
Don't play. You know
that fungus is my bread and butter.

38
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:41,476
Really?

39
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:44,514
You know what my bread and butter is?
Bread and butter.

40
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,576
Fungus has never entered
into the equation. Not once.

41
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:50,072
All the chief said
was that time was of the essence

42
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:53,360
- and that she'd brief us on the boat.
- I wonder what this case is about.

43
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,009
- It has something to do with the ocean.
- It could be anything.

44
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:00,767
Crab on crab violence, a gang war
between the mermen and the shark people,

45
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:03,917
or maybe she wants
to take us wild orca hunting.

46
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:06,144
All right, guys.
Come on up.

47
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,877
All right, here's the deal.

48
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:11,940
A safety inspector named Butch Hicks
fell to his death

49
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,346
from an offshore oil rig last night
and his body washed up onshore.

50
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:18,022
The rig, he was working on,
is the Bamford number 7.

51
00:03:18,142 --> 00:03:20,935
- That's where we're headed.
- First of all, let me just say,

52
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:23,507
awesome, I've always wanted
to go on an oil rig.

53
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:26,407
Excuse me, chief,
but how is this a police matter?

54
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:28,336
From what you've said, it's an accident.

55
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:31,005
That's what the coast guard thinks,
but I'm not so sure.

56
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,090
We received an anonymous tip
about a week ago

57
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:36,266
that we traced to a pay phone outside
the dive shop on the pier.

58
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:39,110
The caller said that something
highly unsafe was going on

59
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,187
out on that rig and that he was risking
everything to warn us.

60
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:44,138
- Dude, harbor seal.
- What?

61
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:47,574
Did you share this information about
the anonymous tip with the coast guard?

62
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,895
Absolutely not.

63
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:52,163
I've had dealings with them in the past
and I don't trust 'em.

64
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:56,701
If you suspect foul play, shouldn't your
lead detective be here? Where's lassie?

65
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,449
And Juliet?
Shouldn't she be here?

66
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:02,524
The truth is...
what we're doing isn't exact.

67
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:05,582
We're acting more
in an unofficial capacity,

68
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:08,166
more questions and I'm gonna turn
this boat around, take you both

69
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:10,474
- back to shore, understood?
- I'm all right with that.

70
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:12,560
- Except that Gus' leg is touching mine.
- Is not.

71
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,356
- He keeps looking at my ear.
- Enough.

72
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:16,594
Now we're gonna be there
in about five...

73
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:19,487
<i>This is the U.S. coast guard.</i>

74
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:22,125
<i>Stop your engine
and prepare to be boarded.</i>

75
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:23,179
Damn it.

76
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,014
I'll handle this.

77
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,810
Good morning.

78
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:37,121
Good morning.
What brings you out here?

79
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:40,106
- Just doing a little sight-seeing.
- Is that right? What's this?

80
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,610
It's a rig manifest.
You wouldn't be thinking of nosing in

81
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,495
on my accidental death case, would you?

82
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,637
Cause that's my jurisdiction.

83
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:50,042
Sorry to break it to you, commander,
but according to the GPS,

84
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:53,224
that southeast corner of the rig crosses
back inside three miles,

85
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:55,840
which brings it under my jurisdiction.

86
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:59,285
You don't want to come up against me
because you will lose.

87
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:01,168
We'll see about that.

88
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:04,223
Hi, commander, I'm Shawn Spencer,

89
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,607
amateur dolphinologist,
big fan of the briny and lemon squares.

90
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:09,145
Stay out of this.

91
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:11,188
Don't worry, chief.
I'm sure the commander here

92
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,728
is a perfectly reasonable human person.
Here's the thing.

93
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,638
We received an anonymous tip

94
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:18,196
that there may be more going on here
than meets the eye.

95
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,478
So with your blessing, of course,
we'd like to go ahead

96
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:23,136
and check out the rig.

97
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,954
Anonymous tip? You weren't gonna share
this information with me?

98
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:28,065
Like you ever shared anything with me.

99
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:31,381
- I Could have you brought up on charge.
- You can't intimidate me.

100
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:34,545
I'm giving you exactly ten seconds
to get this vessel out of my waters.

101
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:36,866
I'd like to see you make me.

102
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,905
My nose is touching yours.
What do you think about that?

103
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:43,475
- Can you do that to a commander?
- You can when she's your sister.

104
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:45,856
Don't you put your nose right up
into mine again.

105
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:48,559
- What if I put it really close?
- What if I actually touch your nose?

106
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:13,305
Yes, sir.

107
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:15,394
I understand.

108
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,847
Judge ruled with me
on jurisdiction, didn't he?

109
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:21,617
But that doesn't change the fact
that I have far more experience

110
00:06:21,737 --> 00:06:24,145
- investigating homicides.
- But this wasn't a homicide.

111
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:27,195
- This was an accident.
- You don't know that for certain.

112
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,881
I can't get over it.

113
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:31,300
After all this time,
the chief never said she had a sister.

114
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,446
It's strange.

115
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:35,226
- And such an alluring sister at that.
- Creepy.

116
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,691
You should hear this.
I got the commander's bio

117
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,544
of the coast guard web site.

118
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,129
"Commander B... "

119
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:43,419
"Commander Barbara Dunlap.

120
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:46,075

"and has saved 57 lives."

125
00:06:57,385 --> 00:07:00,326
- Very impressive.
- Impressive and intoxicating.

126
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:02,600
I mean, all that power in one woman?

127
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:04,500
There's no photo.

128
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:06,095
- Creepier.
- I know

129
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:08,258
I don't care
about your so-called experience.

130
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:10,287
You are not getting anywhere
near my oil rig.

131
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:13,394
Too bad because
we have a psychic, Mr. Spencer,

132
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:15,916
who is gonna figure out
who our anonymous tipster is,

133
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,546
which could be pretty darn important
to the investigation.

134
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:21,026
It could, since this is now
in my jurisdiction,

135
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:22,854
your psychic is my psychic.

136
00:07:27,368 --> 00:07:29,887
Commander...
Carlton Lassiter, head detective.

137
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:33,289
I had no idea that the chief had such
an accomplished younger sister.

138
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:35,041
She's older.

139
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,216
What are you doing standing there?
We have a missing persons case to work.

140
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:44,480
I'd love to stay and chat,
but I have an investigation to conduct.

141
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,054
Spencer, are you coming?

142
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,704
May we have a moment
with the chief, commander?

143
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:53,787
Meet me at the ship. And I'll see you
in an hour. Don't be late.

144
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:59,829
- Chief, I only said yes so that we...
- You don't owe me an explanation.

145
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,757
You do what you have to do.

146
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,460
Is it just me,
or does she seem peeved?

147
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:18,777
All I'm saying is, so much for us being
in chief Vick's good graces.

148
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:22,062
- May have burned our bridge with her.
- Don't be a myopic chihuahua.

149
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:24,384
I have a foolproof plan
that not only solves the case,

150
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,359
- gives chief all the credit.
- What is it?

151
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,649
All I have is the phrase,
"I have a foolproof plan."

152
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,295
Beyond that, i'm wide open.

153
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:38,062
<i>We received an anonymous tip
about a week ago</i>

154
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:41,049
<i>that we traced to a pay phone
outside the dive shop on the pier.</i>

155
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,368
Research time.

156
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,896
Give me everything you got
on offshore oil rigs.

157
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:48,120
Generally, oil platforms are located
on a continental shelf.

158
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,158
- Shelf. Got it.
- A typical platform has around

159
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:51,736
- 30 well heads.
- 30, check.

160
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:55,127
Drilling continues 24 hours a day, there
are two crews on board at all times.

161
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:56,984
One for the day shift,
one for the night.

162
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,077
"Love brokers."

163
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:00,825
Night shift.

164
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:03,460
Come on, dude.
You got the fonz playing against type.

165
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:05,156
Where is this boat?

166
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:06,954
Excuse us.

167
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:09,369
Is this where the coast guard boat
launches from?

168
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:11,417
- Are you Shawn Spencer?
- I am indeed.

169
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:14,236
Commander Dunlap
instructed me to give you this.

170
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:20,966
"Gentlemen, your job is to stay put
and do nothing."

171
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:26,231
I don't believe this. She goes
through all the trouble to hire us

172
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:28,995
- and then leave us behind?
- Don't you see what's happening here?

173
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:30,858
We are merely pawns

174
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:33,751
- in a bitter sibling feud.
- I'm nobody's pawn.

175
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:34,936
I'm a queen.

176
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:39,151
At least I can make
my conference on foot fungus.

177
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:40,963
- We cannot quit.
- Why not?

178
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,235
Because we're not quitters. We're doing
this for the chief, remember?

179
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,682
- We've gotta get on that rig.
- But how?

180
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,843
Have a good trip, Mr. Bamford.

181
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,654
<i>The rig he was working on
is the Bamford number 7,</i>

182
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:58,517
<i>That's where we're headed.</i>

183
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:05,113
I have an idea.
But we'll need cool names.

184
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,710
- So, Mr. Turner...
- Please, call me T-Bone.

185
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,620
T-Bone, have you two invested
in offshore drilling before?

186
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,311
Have we... Yes, lordy.

187
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:20,738
So you're familiar
with the technology?

188
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:22,893
I'd say it's pretty straight forward.

189
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:26,123
You got your basic rig with 30 warheads,
sitting on the continental countertop,

190
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:29,131
running 24 crews day
and night every two hours.

191
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:31,370
That made absolutely no sense.

192
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,821
The truth is, we're not
that sophisticated in the oil business.

193
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:36,243
I didn't think so.

194
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:38,831
My father and I don't appreciate
our time being wasted.

195
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:41,060
You'll have to pardon
my daughter, gentlemen.

196
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,683
Apparently, Yale university
didn't teach her any manners...

197
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:45,136
Or how to get a husband.

198
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:48,386
Honey,
run down there into the galley

199
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:51,517
mix us up some cocktails
while the men talk.

200
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:53,666
Sure.

201
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,829
Not to be rude, Billy Joe,
but it's the 21st century,

202
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:02,054
women have earned the right
to be treated equally.

203
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:03,525
Cut the crap, son.

204
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:06,377
Blind men could see
that you two aren't investors.

205
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:09,352
Technically, a blind man
can't see anything.

206
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:12,049
I offered you a ride out here
so I could take a look at you,

207
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:14,268
figure out what you were up to.

208
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:16,470
What are you?
Government watchdogs?

209
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,346
EPA?

210
00:11:17,758 --> 00:11:19,744
Is this about that little oil spill?

211
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:21,582
You had a oil spill out here?

212
00:11:24,563 --> 00:11:27,368
The truth is that we have not been
completely honest with you.

213
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:29,967
We're working for the coast guard.
My name is Shawn Spencer.

214
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:32,945
This is my partner,
Chesterfield McMillan, and wife.

215
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:35,614
We are investigating
the death of your safety inspector.

216
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:38,617
And whether or not
it was truly an accident.

217
00:11:39,077 --> 00:11:42,671
But we were running late,
so we missed the boat ride out here.

218
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,374
As much as I don't appreciate
being lied to,

219
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:48,044
if you're right about Hicks's death
not being an accident,

220
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,687
I want to know
about it as much as you do.

221
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:52,217
What can I do to help you?

222
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,620
First thing we'll need to see
is Mr. Hicks's personal effects.

223
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,444
And I will be needing
a little baby umbrella in my mal tal.

224
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,559
- What's our missing person's name?
- Dr. Christopher Renaud.

225
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,059
- He's a professor at the university.
- And last seen?

226
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,947
His 3:00 lecture on thursday.

227
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,573
We're gonna need a list of all
the people in attendance that day.

228
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:19,228
I've obtained a list from the TA,

229
00:12:19,348 --> 00:12:22,179
I've set up interviews with each
and every one of his students.

230
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:23,868
Good work, O'Hara.

231
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,794
- One more thing.
- Shoot.

232
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,398
I am thinking of asking
out commander Dunlap on a date.

233
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,826
Your thoughts.

234
00:12:34,313 --> 00:12:35,841
I think it's a bad idea.

235
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,048
Really?

236
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:38,436
Why?

237
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:43,408
For starters, you know,
she's the chief's sister.

238
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:47,186
Not to mention, they don't get along.
{\You saw the way}They're screaming at each other.

239
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:48,383
See it?

240
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:50,880
I devoured it.
It was incredible.

241
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:53,555
She's a real snap pea, isn't she?

242
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:57,113
She's got that great sturdy build.

243
00:12:57,702 --> 00:12:58,512
Yeah.

244
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:03,387
Why don't we focus on interviewing our
witnesses for the missing persons case?

245
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:06,789
Absolutely. Forget I even
mentioned that other thing.

246
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:07,972
I will.

247
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:17,583
There was an anonymous tip

248
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:20,556
that something unsafe
was going on out here.

249
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:23,061
Any clue as to what the caller
might have been referring to?

250
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:26,126
I have no idea.
This place is run strictly by the book.

251
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:29,145
Butch Hicks made sure of that,
and so do I.

252
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:30,807
You can ask anybody.

253
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:34,428
My professional reputation
is based on safety.

254
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:36,694
Watch your head going in here now.

255
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:39,311
Somebody put a rail
on this side of this ladder.

256
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:40,803
That's a violation.

257
00:13:42,373 --> 00:13:43,911
Here's Hicks's office.

258
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:45,623
Let's see.

259
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,508
- What's in here?
- That's the geologist's lab.

260
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,838
My daughter's trying
to get me all High-Tech.

261
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,549
She thinks because I punched
a few dry holes

262
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:01,968
that I've lost my touch,
and she talked me into hiring this...

263
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:03,664
fancy rock doctor.

264
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:05,374
Showing me where to dig.

265
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:08,252
I don't need nobody
to tell me where to dig.

266
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:10,186
Once this well comes in like I know

267
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:11,527
it's going to,

268
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:13,647
I'm gonna be back on top again.

269
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:16,583
You guys take your time.

270
00:14:16,703 --> 00:14:18,712
If you need me, I'll be topside.

271
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:20,996
If you need us, we'll be bottoms-up.

272
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,231
- What are we looking for?
- Anything that will help us figure out

273
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:29,104
who the anonymous tipster was.

274
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:30,927
Or a Kit Kat.
I'm starving.

275
00:14:31,555 --> 00:14:33,806
Since hicks was in charge
of safety on the rig,

276
00:14:33,926 --> 00:14:37,040
it's safe to assume the tipster
may have come to him first.

277
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,860
I have this big stack
of safety violation reports.

278
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,259
Man, this guy Hicks
was a real stickler.

279
00:14:42,922 --> 00:14:45,221
If by stickler,
you mean a guy who doesn't have

280
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:47,360
any snacks, I agree with that.

281
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:54,966
What are you two doing here?

282
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,590
Not eating candy,
I can tell you that.

283
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,462
My orders for you
were to stay put and do nothing.

284
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,262
Really, that wasn't reverse psychology?

285
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:03,237
Out.

286
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:04,126
Wait.

287
00:15:04,518 --> 00:15:06,667
I was drawn to this office.

288
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:09,160
With very powerful psychic visions

289
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:12,706
of a man in scuba gear with
a salamander in his wetsuit.

290
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:15,584
Well, thank you, Mr. Spencer,
but I don't see how that's helpful.

291
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:16,585
Or healthy.

292
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:18,504
Wait, I'm seeing more.

293
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:20,256
The anonymous tipster.

294
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,715
I can tell you where he is.

295
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,842
Really?
And where's that?

296
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:25,719
The morgue.

297
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:30,158
Commander, look.

298
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:33,727
My myriad psychic detective skills
assure me that the anonymous tipster

299
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:35,813
is safety inspector butch hicks.

300
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:38,482
- Your psychic detective skills?
- You left out myriad.

301
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:40,097
- Right.
- Wait, there's more.

302
00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:42,753
I see a security camera
in front of the dive shop.

303
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:45,823
All you have to do is review friday's
tape and you'll see that I'm right.

304
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:48,409
Fine. Let's say you are right.
It doesn't change anything.

305
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:52,246
All the evidence still points to
his death being an accident, let's go.

306
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:58,399
As long as I'm in charge of this case,
you will follow my orders to the letter.

307
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,587
My orders are that you get off this rig.

308
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:03,411
We have a shuttle leaving in an hour.
You will be on it.

309
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:08,650
Is it just me, or is that woman
a tinge bossy?

310
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,874
She scares me.

311
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,173
Let's hop to it.

312
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:13,871
We have less than an hour to interview
every worker on the night shift.

313
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:16,224
No, let's discuss something
that won't get us into trouble.

314
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:18,420
Like where we're gonna eat
when we get back to shore.

315
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,114
All that kit kat talk made me hungry.

316
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:21,746
This may be the only chance we have

317
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,816
to weed out who might
have wanted to kill hicks.

318
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:26,185
If the commander finds us,
she's gonna go ape...

319
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:29,491
Do I smell meatloaf?

320
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:32,453
And fresh apple cobbler,
if I'm not mistaken.

321
00:16:32,835 --> 00:16:35,627
I guess it won't hurt
to ask a few questions.

322
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:44,333
Well, hello, miss ashley.

323
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:49,178
Would you kindly direct my
buddy and I to the chuck wagon, please?

324
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:50,638
I'm sorry?

325
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:52,652
We would like to know where
the mess hall is.

326
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:53,891
It's two decks down.

327
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:56,598
Awesome. Would you like
to have lunch with us?

328
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:59,046
Perhaps, afterwards, you could
give us a little tour?

329
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:03,209
Regardless of how my father treats me,

330
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:05,402
I'm not the cruise director here.

331
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:09,865
So tell me about the safety inspector.

332
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:12,337
That guy was always writing me up
for the smallest infraction.

333
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:14,424
I hate to say it,
but I'm glad he's dead.

334
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,665
There's no dairy in that, is there?

335
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:21,334
You know, I had a dream that
I knifed him in his sleep.

336
00:17:22,283 --> 00:17:23,716
But I woke up.

337
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:26,215
Hicks should have never gone
into no man's land.

338
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,424
No man's land?

339
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:30,287
It's the area that's strictly off-limits
during crane operation.

340
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:33,409
Hicks should have known better.
I mean, he was a safety inspector.

341
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:37,306
Anyway, it's a shame if someone
loosened that tackle and killed him.

342
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,479
You know, you're the first
person to show any mpathy for hicks.

343
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,439
What?

344
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,402
No, I'm saying if it was me,
I would have used a gun.

345
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:51,345
This place is lousy with suspects.

346
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:53,280
And excessively heavy food.

347
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,549
I think I ate my weight in that
cowboy chicken casserole.

348
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:58,080
Man, this food was disgusting.

349
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:01,375
All I had was a half a bran muffin.
What's our next move?

350
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:04,397
Well, I think we need to get
into hicks's house.

351
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:05,963
If there really was a conspiracy

352
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,160
to kill him, we're gonna need
hard evidence.

353
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,535
When we get back to shore,
we go see chief vick.

354
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,308
First we go home, change
into our jammies, take a nap,

355
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,432
then we wake up, have some juice.

356
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:19,074
Then straight to Vick.

357
00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:23,282
All right, well, call me if anyone
matching that description shows up.

358
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,268
Thanks.

359
00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:25,252
Hey, Jules.

360
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:26,973
- Chief in her office?
- Ladies room.

361
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:28,888
Darn. Gus and I really
need to speak to her.

362
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,599
Think you can give us a numeral so
we can gauge just how long she'll be?

363
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,406
I don't know.
Five, seven minutes maybe.

364
00:18:33,594 --> 00:18:36,162
- How about number one or number two?
- I have no idea, shawn.

365
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,371
And no, I am not gonna go to the
ladies room and check on her for you.

366
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:41,913
- Is this your missing person?
- Dr. Christopher renaud.

367
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:44,924
He's a professor at the university.
Been missing for a week.

368
00:18:45,611 --> 00:18:47,749
- What are you two doing here?
- Oh, we have our answer.

369
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:49,723
- Tinkle.
- Chief, we need your help.

370
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:51,242
Oh, you need my help.

371
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:53,652
Oh, I've got to give you credit,
Mr. Spencer.

372
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:55,512
You have more than
your share of gumption.

373
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:58,432
- This will only take a minute.
- Come on. For old times' sake.

374
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:00,655
One minute. No more.

375
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:04,281
Chief, I read every single
worker on that rig.

376
00:19:04,401 --> 00:19:05,845
And they all hated hicks.

377
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:08,343
I'm getting two very
distinct psychic vibes here.

378
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:09,312
The first...

379
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:11,348
There was a conspiracy behind
hicks's death.

380
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:15,033
Second, Craig T. Nelson will donate
his remaing hair to the Smithsonian.

381
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,493
Yeah, look, chief, we need help
learning more about hicks,

382
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:19,953
and a good start would be access
to where he lived.

383
00:19:20,113 --> 00:19:22,481
I still don't understand why
you're coming to me with this.

384
00:19:22,601 --> 00:19:24,348
I mean, why don't you go
to the commander?

385
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:26,696
She really doesn't want us
involved with this case.

386
00:19:26,816 --> 00:19:28,003
Really?
Imagine that.

387
00:19:28,342 --> 00:19:30,280
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

388
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,008
As the commander pointed out,
this case is out of my jurisdiction,

389
00:19:33,168 --> 00:19:35,106
and your minute is up.

390
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,127
Gus, will you excuse us? I need
to speak with the chief in private.

391
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:40,098
No problem.

392
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:44,119
Just so you know, it was Shawn's idea
for us to go with your sister.

393
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:50,030
Karen.

394
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:51,624
Chief karen.

395
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:53,406
Chief karen vick?

396
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:55,906
That just feels a little long,
doesn't it?

397
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:57,741
I said I'm busy, Mr. Spencer.

398
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,451
I'm sensing something here.

399
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:01,095
Don't do that.

400
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:05,624
Look, the only reason I took
this case was to help you.

401
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:07,209
Oh, really?
Help me how?

402
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:10,462
If I can tie that murder to
a piece of evidence on land,

403
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:12,214
the case is back in your jurisdiction.

404
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:16,077
Well, that's actually kind of sweet.

405
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,404
Don't tell anyone I used that word.

406
00:20:18,524 --> 00:20:19,528
Deal.

407
00:20:20,092 --> 00:20:22,224
Now I know it's none
of my business, but

408
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:25,352
what is going on with you
and commander babs?

409
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:27,187
It's complicated.

410
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:29,940
Believe me. I know what it feels like
growing up with

411
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:31,909
an older sister who gets
all the attention.

412
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:34,027
I didn't know you had
an older sister, Spencer.

413
00:20:34,147 --> 00:20:34,915
I don't.

414
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:37,155
But I did watch a lot
of reruns ofthe brady bunch.

415
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:40,870
You know,

416
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:43,472
barbara and I weren't always like this.

417
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:44,925
I mean, we used to be...

418
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:47,165
Well, close.

419
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:50,210
I know exactly how you feel.
And by I, I mean jan.

420
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:53,950
So was it something

421
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:57,175
specific that brought things to a head?

422
00:20:57,652 --> 00:20:59,895
No, nothing specific.

423
00:21:00,946 --> 00:21:04,507
It's just years of trying to
outdo each other.

424
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:07,780
So...

425
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,481
Should I go divine that piece
of evidence I was referring to?

426
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:14,151
I don't know. Should you?

427
00:21:30,982 --> 00:21:32,032
Shawn!

428
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,076
I'm sorry, buddy.

429
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:36,340
There we go.

430
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:37,962
Right in there.

431
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,821
Looks like Hicks's obsession with
safety did not extend to his colon.

432
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,402
Vick will go ballistic if she
found out we broke in here.

433
00:21:48,522 --> 00:21:50,577
We didn't break in. The window
was open. Now come on.

434
00:21:50,697 --> 00:21:53,244
- What the heck are we looking for?
- Anything hicks may have received

435
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:55,158
with the threat of violence.
Correspondence,

436
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:58,229
- angry phone messages, mash notes.
- Mash notes are love letters, Shawn.

437
00:21:59,472 --> 00:22:00,472
Really?

438
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:03,098
Remind me.
I owe someone a huge apology.

439
00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:05,327
Let's start with this computer.

440
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:07,694
I guess I have to break the pass code.

441
00:22:13,453 --> 00:22:14,503
Panther21.

442
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:16,672
- Panther21?
- Just try it.

443
00:22:20,937 --> 00:22:21,831
That's it.

444
00:22:22,446 --> 00:22:25,101
You got all that just from putting
together things from around the room?

445
00:22:25,221 --> 00:22:28,972
No, it was written on the computer.
I saw the reflection on the cd case.

446
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,186
All right,

447
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:36,233
Almost all of his recent emails
are from someone called bishop77.

448
00:22:37,003 --> 00:22:38,488
"Why haven't you called me back?

449
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,904
"The situation on the rig is getting
more serious every day.

450
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,156
"Why are you ignoring me?"

451
00:22:43,316 --> 00:22:45,299
Dude, listen to this one.

452
00:22:45,652 --> 00:22:48,912
"If you don't do something about this,
I'll go to the authorities."

453
00:22:49,473 --> 00:22:50,775
You know what this means?

454
00:22:50,895 --> 00:22:52,786
Bishop77 is the anonymous tipster,
not Hicks.

455
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:54,479
And if we could figure out who he is,

456
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,779
we could find out what's really
going on out on that rig.

457
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:58,921
And who killed hicks, and why.
Bishop77...

458
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:01,405
- He's catholic, or he plays chess.
- I got it. I got it.

459
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:03,593
A guy at work showed me
how to take an email address

460
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:05,220
and get its owner's real name.

461
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,340
I'll start by using an email header to
trace back to the original ip address...

462
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,018
What?

463
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:14,352
Dear god, what are you doing?

464
00:23:14,472 --> 00:23:18,081
Shawn, what did I tell you
about eating onions during lunch?

465
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:21,090
It makes your breath stink.
That's why I bought you those mints.

466
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,029
Use them.

467
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:24,977
I didn't eat onions during lunch.
I ate everything but onions.

468
00:23:25,097 --> 00:23:26,461
I don't smell anything.

469
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:34,473
That smells good.

470
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,755
That smells really good.

471
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,631
Dude, it's coming from inside here.

472
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:43,324
Well, open it up.

473
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:50,849
Why does it always
have to be a dead guy?

474
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:53,143
- Why does he smell like onions?
- Will you help me?

475
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,440
Who do you think it is?

476
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,736
- Is this your missing person?
- Dr. Christopher renaud.

477
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,698
That's Lassiter and Juliet's
missing person.

478
00:24:25,168 --> 00:24:27,960
- Mr. Spencer, what's this about?
- Whoa, whoa, wait, he works for me.

479
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,471
Mr. Spencer, what's this about?

480
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:31,660
The reason I called
the two of you is because

481
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,053
there's something in this house
that concerns you both.

482
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:37,623
Oh, please don't tell me you went
into Hicks' House without a warrant.

483
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:40,110
Hey, warrant... No one talked
to me about a warrant.

484
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,085
I need a warrant?
All of a sudden?

485
00:24:42,536 --> 00:24:44,945
I'm a diviner. It all happens here.

486
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,363
And here.

487
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,950
And, in extreme cases, here.

488
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,701
Okay, what exactly is in there?

489
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:54,663
A missing person.
Professor... Renaud?

490
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,915
That's our missing person.

491
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:59,127
But we never found a connection
between he and Hicks.

492
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,414
We'll check it out.

493
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:03,593
What would renaud be
doing in hicks's house?

494
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:06,424
- And how does this affect my case?
- Oh, wait, i'm getting something.

495
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,653
Talked me into hiring
this fancy rock doctor.

496
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:11,194
Showing me where to dig.

497
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:13,849
Well, I don't need anybody
to show me where to dig.

498
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:16,771
Renaud worked as a consulting geologist

499
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,907
for hicks's employer,
bamford exploration.

500
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:21,314
It's Renaud.
Spencer's right.

501
00:25:21,713 --> 00:25:23,233
Not words I enjoy saying.

502
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:25,778
Okay, then.

503
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:29,154
Well, I'd say that ties up
the missing person case quite nicely.

504
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:33,118
This is usually the place where
you say, "nice work, Spencer."

505
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,038
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

506
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,665
The victim worked for bamford drilling.

507
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,642
What does that have
to do with hicks's murder?

508
00:25:41,762 --> 00:25:42,793
If you don't mind,

509
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:45,755
let me ask the questions because in
case you haven't noticed, we're on land.

510
00:25:45,915 --> 00:25:47,870
Which brings this case back
into my jurisdiction.

511
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,781
- Listen to yourself, will you?
- "my jurisdiction."

512
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:52,888
You're only interested in
this case because you're

513
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:54,842
- itching to horn in on my turf.
- Itching?

514
00:25:54,962 --> 00:25:56,719
Oh, my... Listen to yourself!

515
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:57,657
Your turf?

516
00:25:57,777 --> 00:25:59,769
We're talking about a whole ocean,
not the tv room.

517
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:01,592
Whoa, whoa, sisters, please.

518
00:26:01,874 --> 00:26:03,511
Nobody's getting horned here.

519
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:04,907
Two men are dead.

520
00:26:05,027 --> 00:26:07,217
This is not the time for
petty sibling squabbles.

521
00:26:07,337 --> 00:26:08,790
That's what thanksgiving is for.

522
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,331
We need to come together and work
as a group to get to the truth.

523
00:26:11,451 --> 00:26:13,074
And the truth is,

524
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:17,078
Rnaud is our anonymous tipster,
not hicks.

525
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:20,207
I can see a series of emails
from renaud to hicks,

526
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:22,028
the safety inspector, warning him

527
00:26:22,202 --> 00:26:24,169
that something unsafe was
happening on that rig.

528
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:26,695
But hicks, he refuses
to address the issue,

529
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:28,909
probably because he's covering
something up.

530
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:32,802
And then, fearing that the truth
would get out, he ext... Pssh!

531
00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:35,013
Stop!
Hammer time! Whoosh!

532
00:26:37,592 --> 00:26:39,011
Hicks kills Renaud.

533
00:26:39,271 --> 00:26:41,880
The question is, what was
Hicks trying to hide?

534
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,105
Thank you for that eloquent
summation, Mr. Spencer.

535
00:26:44,265 --> 00:26:46,691
It's my pleasure, chief.
I think our next move should be...

536
00:26:46,851 --> 00:26:48,985
For me to have Lassiter and O'Hara
now look into it.

537
00:26:52,165 --> 00:26:54,275
Wait, wait.
Okay, this is great.

538
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:56,965
Barbara just witnessed the chief
choose me over spencer.

539
00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:59,466
In her eyes, my stock just went up.

540
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:03,030
Now if I could just get her to witness
me discharge my weapon.

541
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:07,920
Well, Mr. Spencer, this case does
warrant further investigation

542
00:27:08,082 --> 00:27:09,650
on my end as well.

543
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,316
Absolutely.
Thank you, commander.

544
00:27:11,436 --> 00:27:14,009
I think the first thing we need
to investigate is why hicks was in

545
00:27:14,171 --> 00:27:15,136
no man's land.

546
00:27:15,296 --> 00:27:17,614
The safety inspector, of all people,
should have known better.

547
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:19,641
I'll have my people look into that.

548
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:21,518
By the way, you're fired.

549
00:27:24,764 --> 00:27:26,231
Fired?

550
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:27,961
Nobody fires me, shawn.

551
00:27:28,432 --> 00:27:29,717
What do we do next?

552
00:27:29,837 --> 00:27:32,434
I can't stop asking myself,
why was the geologist's office

553
00:27:32,554 --> 00:27:35,407
the only door that was locked?
I'm telling you, something was in there.

554
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:37,826
We gotta get back on that rig.
But how?

555
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:39,902
- I have an idea.
- Is it good?

556
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:41,167
Not really.

557
00:27:42,956 --> 00:27:44,339
Dad!
W- wait! Wait, wait.

558
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:45,778
Ah, thank god!

559
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,341
Shawn, what are you doing here?

560
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:51,506
You know what, gus and I thought
maybe we'd go out with you today.

561
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,940
That's a first... Every time I ask you
to go out fishing, you

562
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,136
come up with some lame excuse.
What was it last time?

563
00:27:56,296 --> 00:27:58,243
It was... One word.
The books.

564
00:27:58,363 --> 00:28:00,261
That's funny.

565
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:01,778
What can I say?

566
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:04,723
We're both in the mood
for some serious angling.

567
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:10,317
- We heard the big ones are biting.
- That's not what I heard,

568
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:13,194
the storm scared all the fish away.

569
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:16,132
Wait a minute.
What did you hear is biting?

570
00:28:17,168 --> 00:28:18,313
It's not pike, is it?

571
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:22,203
As a matter of fact, it was pike.
Man, the pike is biting.

572
00:28:22,363 --> 00:28:24,656
Yeah, well, pike is a freshwater fish.

573
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:28,126
In case you morons haven't noticed,
that's the ocean out there.

574
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:30,225
All right, shawn, what's up?
What do you want?

575
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:33,840
We believe the evidence we need to
solve a case is on an offshore oil rig.

576
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,759
It's the bamford number seven.

577
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,035
We were hoping that you could
give us a lift out there.

578
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:39,557
Can't do it.
Sorry, guys.

579
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:42,868
Even if I was so inclined, this boat
isn't designed to go out that far.

580
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,533
Dad, come on, this is important.
It's not just about solving the case.

581
00:28:45,653 --> 00:28:47,641
We gotta get back in vick's good graces.

582
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:49,227
Cannot do it.

583
00:28:49,918 --> 00:28:51,031
Shocking.

584
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:53,804
But I think I got a friend over here...

585
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:55,820
Captain dale might be able
to help you out.

586
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:03,703
Course, you'll have to do some chores.

587
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:06,676
Chores?

588
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,350
- Can I come in?
- What do you want, barb?

589
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,260
Here to argue some more
about jurisdiction?

590
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,491
Actually, no.

591
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:22,619
Yeah, well, I have a lot
of work to do, so...

592
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:26,694
Well, the thing is, is I had my people
look into what Spencer said.

593
00:29:27,494 --> 00:29:30,192
What was Hicks doing out
in no man's land?

594
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,055
Did somebody lure him out there?

595
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:34,150
So I took a trip out to the rig,

596
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,612
had a look at the crane, it turns out
the crane had been tampered with.

597
00:29:39,307 --> 00:29:40,625
Hicks was murdered.

598
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:42,784
And I was wrong.

599
00:29:49,993 --> 00:29:52,293
Spencer was right

600
00:29:52,863 --> 00:29:54,379
about Hicks murdering renaud.

601
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:56,839
His prints were all
over the murder weapon.

602
00:29:57,553 --> 00:30:00,760
Well, then, we need to find Spencer
and see what else he's figured out.

603
00:30:01,803 --> 00:30:03,430
- Lead the way.
- Can i?

604
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:06,182
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

605
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:22,269
Damn that captain dale.

606
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:24,244
I still smell like fish.
I hate fish.

607
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,210
That's not true.
You love my cajun crawfish hushpuppies.

608
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,020
That's mostly cornmeal,
and you know that.

609
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:43,174
Look what you did to my credit card.
You ruined it.

610
00:30:43,294 --> 00:30:46,931
Dude, it had a 29.7% interest rate.
I did you a favor.

611
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:49,225
Stop complaining.
Start looking.

612
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:52,402
You good on litmus paper?

613
00:31:14,644 --> 00:31:16,217
What the heck is that?

614
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,300
Looks like a map.

615
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:22,063
BR number seven.

616
00:31:24,155 --> 00:31:26,638
<i>I don't need nobody to tell
me where to dig.</i>

617
00:31:28,498 --> 00:31:31,259
Why would renaud hand draw a map
that already existed?

618
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:33,305
Remember that map
we saw in the corridor?

619
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,525
Go grab it.

620
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,642
That's what Renaud meant
{\when he said}by they were doing something unsafe.

621
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:15,018
They're not drilling
where they say they're drilling.

622
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:17,454
They're drilling directly
on a fault line.

623
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:26,680
This is a private lab.
What are you two doing in here?

624
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,164
Dude, I got this.

625
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:32,996
Ashley, the truth is that I'm a psychic.
A damn good one, I've been told.

626
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,858
I am sensing that there is stuff
going on that will be hard

627
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:37,959
for you to hear.

628
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:40,596
Very hard.

629
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:45,425
Very, very hard.

630
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:47,404
Damn, girl, you are so lean.

631
00:32:47,795 --> 00:32:50,305
- What, do you spin?
- I thought you said you got this.

632
00:32:50,465 --> 00:32:52,515
Sorry.
I'm... I'm seeing faults.

633
00:32:53,153 --> 00:32:55,143
Faulty something.
Faulty intelligence.

634
00:32:55,303 --> 00:32:57,260
Faulty wiring.
Fawlty towers.

635
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,485
Fault.

636
00:32:58,605 --> 00:32:59,668
Your father

637
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:01,941
is drilling into a fault line.

638
00:33:03,427 --> 00:33:05,205
- What?
- Yeah, he made a fake map

639
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:07,603
with the help of Dr. Dre.

640
00:33:07,723 --> 00:33:09,385
No, Dr. Pepper.

641
00:33:09,646 --> 00:33:12,418
No, Dr. No.
No, Dr... Dr. Renaud!

642
00:33:13,403 --> 00:33:15,702
- Our geologist.
- That's right. There's more.

643
00:33:15,822 --> 00:33:17,997
Unfortunately,
I think your father may be responsible

644
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:20,418
for the deaths of Dr. Renaud and Hicks.

645
00:33:21,394 --> 00:33:23,928
I think he's trying to cover his tracks.

646
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:28,595
I'm... I'm sorry.
I can't believe that

647
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:29,927
Dad would do that.

648
00:33:30,087 --> 00:33:31,003
I know.

649
00:33:31,123 --> 00:33:32,805
He's always been a risk-taker,

650
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:35,952
willing to gamble everything...

651
00:33:36,072 --> 00:33:39,020
If he thought there was oil
to be found.

652
00:33:42,427 --> 00:33:45,128
But I can't believe
that he would do this.

653
00:33:46,451 --> 00:33:48,262
- I feel sick.
- It's okay.

654
00:33:49,151 --> 00:33:52,033
- We're gonna get through this together.
- Probably over dinner.

655
00:33:52,193 --> 00:33:54,638
I was thinking tapas,
but I could be talked into greek.

656
00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:57,580
- We need to stop drilling immediately.
- Right.

657
00:33:57,978 --> 00:34:00,333
And as far as dinner goes,
let's just put a pin in it.

658
00:34:02,614 --> 00:34:06,354
Communications room is down the hall.
We'll radio up to the floor

659
00:34:06,474 --> 00:34:08,504
and tell them to suspend operations.

660
00:34:11,102 --> 00:34:12,727
The light is on the opposite wall.

661
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:15,181
- I'll turn on the radio.
- I know It isn't easy,

662
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:18,719
hearing{\ that} your father isn't
who you thought{\ he was}, but you're doing{\ the} right{\ thing}.

663
00:34:19,165 --> 00:34:20,905
This is the radio room?

664
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,481
Sweetie pop.
Come on now.

665
00:34:24,176 --> 00:34:26,478
You shouldn't have come back
out here, Shawn.

666
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:29,445
Now I'm gonna have to figure out
a way to get rid of you.

667
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:35,660
I might have made a mistake.

668
00:34:36,078 --> 00:34:39,002
She fills those jeans out quite nicely,
though.

669
00:34:41,951 --> 00:34:45,736
Shawn, that sign says "toxic fumes."
I am breathing in toxic fumes.

670
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,078
Come on, dude.

671
00:34:47,266 --> 00:34:50,303
You think they gonna expose employees
to stuff that's really harmful?

672
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:51,956
Did you not seesilkwood, shawn?

673
00:34:52,076 --> 00:34:55,175
They're gonna make me take a shower
where they scrub my skin off.

674
00:34:57,653 --> 00:34:59,267
Miss Bamford, can we talk to you?

675
00:35:00,088 --> 00:35:03,334
- Can it wait? I'm really busy.
- Sorry, honey, it can't wait.

676
00:35:03,576 --> 00:35:06,107
{\See, we know that }Hicks's death wasn't an accident.
That he was murdered.

677
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:09,303
It looks like we have solid alibis
from everybody on the rig that night.

678
00:35:09,423 --> 00:35:13,781
The pilot said there was a passenger
who wasn't on the manifest.

679
00:35:14,337 --> 00:35:16,286
That passenger was you,
Miss Bamford.

680
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,582
We're hoping you can clear this up{\ for us}.
Why were you out there that night?

681
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:21,901
And why didn't you want your name
on the manifest?

682
00:35:22,021 --> 00:35:24,924
Well, that's simple.
I was... you see...

683
00:35:26,078 --> 00:35:28,463
Sometimes
I like to make surprise visits.

684
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:31,048
- She's got a weapon!
- Halt!

685
00:35:40,288 --> 00:35:41,588
We gotta get outta here.

686
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:44,084
{\I think the rule is }When you hear gunfire,
you don't go towards it.

687
00:35:44,204 --> 00:35:46,147
We're in here! We're in here!

688
00:35:56,565 --> 00:35:59,660
Jules, Lassie. Thank god.
It's Ashley Bamford. She's armed.

689
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,544
We know. We're in pursuit.
You two stay put.

690
00:36:02,664 --> 00:36:04,724
- Do you understand?
- Got it.

691
00:36:06,828 --> 00:36:08,420
What part of {\"stay put"}it is confusing to you?

692
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,210
The put part. "Stay put"?
I wasn't put in the first place, Gus.

693
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,549
The expression is a complete disaster.
Look.

694
00:36:21,665 --> 00:36:24,352
- What's her 20?
- On the left. 30 feet.

695
00:36:24,512 --> 00:36:25,853
It's more like 35 feet.

696
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:28,856
Why do you always have to feel
like you have to correct me?

697
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,733
Was I correcting?
I don't mean it.

698
00:36:30,893 --> 00:36:32,109
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

699
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:42,456
- What the hell are you doing?
- I have a plan.

700
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,497
It's called "Gus is a table."

701
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,973
- I'm a what?
- It was our signature prank{\ in the seventh grade}.

702
00:36:57,093 --> 00:36:59,024
I know you remember this.
"Gus is a table."

703
00:36:59,144 --> 00:37:00,583
Let me get thi...

704
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:12,326
Let me get this straight.

705
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:15,592
You want me to sneak up behind her{\ on all fours},
so you can push her, and she'll fall{\ over me}?

706
00:37:15,712 --> 00:37:16,531
Exactly.

707
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,058
I'll distract her
while you get in position.

708
00:37:29,842 --> 00:37:32,837
- Don't make me shoot you.
- It's okay. I just wanna talk.

709
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:35,566
I'm putting my cards on the table.

710
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:38,342
Right smack dab on the table!

711
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:40,887
- Doesn't matter. It's too late.
- No, no, no, no!

712
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,110
No, no, no, it's not too late.

713
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:45,850
- Gus is a table.
- Gus is a statue.

714
00:37:46,428 --> 00:37:48,076
- You're a sellout!
- What's going on?

715
00:37:48,196 --> 00:37:50,415
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing, nothing.

716
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:51,899
Nothing's going on.

717
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:56,654
- Don't come any closer, Shawn.
- What is he doing?

718
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:58,446
I have no idea.

719
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:01,115
- Shawn, get out of there!
- Juliet, stay back.

720
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:03,826
All of you, stay back.

721
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,014
And stop shooting.

722
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,176
Look, Ashley...

723
00:38:12,237 --> 00:38:14,211
I know what it feels like

724
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:17,757
to have a dad that does not appreciate
or respect you.

725
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,225
Let me tell you what I see.

726
00:38:22,628 --> 00:38:26,140
I see a gorgeous young woman
with a smart jacket.

727
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:30,561
And an impressive education,
and even more impressive

728
00:38:30,952 --> 00:38:32,428
arm muscle tone,

729
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:34,915
who desperately wanted to save

730
00:38:35,128 --> 00:38:36,776
her father's crumbling business.

731
00:38:37,278 --> 00:38:39,654
I know that's why you had Renaud
make the fake map,

732
00:38:39,814 --> 00:38:42,531
so that nobody would know
you were drilling into{\ a dangerous} fault line.

733
00:38:43,943 --> 00:38:46,827
And when Butch Hicks found out about it,
you did what any good child

734
00:38:46,987 --> 00:38:48,704
would do in your place.

735
00:38:48,904 --> 00:38:50,341
You had no choice.

736
00:38:51,344 --> 00:38:52,452
You had to kill him.

737
00:38:52,806 --> 00:38:55,256
I couldn't have let hicks
or anyone else get in the way.

738
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:57,796
- You understand that, don't you, Shawn?
- Of course I do.

739
00:38:57,916 --> 00:38:59,148
Are you kidding me?

740
00:38:59,492 --> 00:39:00,925
I completely understand.

741
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:06,263
What are you doing?
Give me that.

742
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:08,998
Give me that gun.

743
00:39:11,406 --> 00:39:12,436
It's okay.

744
00:39:18,644 --> 00:39:19,485
Come here.

745
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,056
Did Barbara see that?

746
00:39:35,934 --> 00:39:38,295
Well, I gotta say,
Mr. Spencer, nice work.

747
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,132
Thanks, chief.
No help to my table.

748
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,467
No help to my table.

749
00:39:48,066 --> 00:39:51,642
This really isn't necessary.
I already told you guys you're forgiven.

750
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:55,187
I should be giving you gifts for
bringing me and my sister back together.

751
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:56,565
Chief, stop it.

752
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,233
The only gift we'll ever need from you
is your sweet, toothy smile.

753
00:39:59,907 --> 00:40:02,322
And any possible cases
you might want to send our way.

754
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,153
But mostly the toothy smile.

755
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:08,492
Well, ahoy, Commander.
Welcome aboard.

756
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,189
- Thar she blows.
- All hands on deck.

757
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:14,280
Enough, the painfully cute mugging
is starting to get on my nerves.

758
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,095
What are you, entertainment weekly?

759
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:19,224
- So we still on for lunch, Kare?
- Absolutely.

760
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,126
This is kind of awkward,

761
00:40:21,706 --> 00:40:24,175
but I'm thinking
of asking out detective Lassiter.

762
00:40:24,918 --> 00:40:26,375
What do you think?

763
00:40:29,983 --> 00:40:32,308
- You don'want to go there.
- Really? Why?

764
00:40:32,468 --> 00:40:35,686
It's just he's a little... wound up.

765
00:40:35,846 --> 00:40:38,356
And trust me, you'd be far better off
pursuing somebody else.

766
00:40:38,476 --> 00:40:41,192
- I'm doing you a favor.
- I get it. You want him for yourself.

767
00:40:42,257 --> 00:40:43,074
What?

768
00:40:43,194 --> 00:40:45,640
No, I'm married, Barb.

769
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,782
And even if I weren't,
I mean, Carlton?

770
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:55,439
- You are so transparent.
- Transparent?

771
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:58,024
You can't stand to see me
with someone you're attracted to.

772
00:40:58,144 --> 00:41:00,404
- All of a sudden too, by the way.
- Often... transparent...

773
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,343
You know, fine.
You know what?

774
00:41:02,463 --> 00:41:04,316
- Ask out Lassiter.
- I will.

775
00:41:04,436 --> 00:41:05,494
Go ahead.

776
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:09,741
You, me, lunch.

777
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,353
So I take it the sibling rivalry
is back on?

778
00:41:17,718 --> 00:41:18,897
Oh, it's on.

779
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:20,864
And I am so winning.

780
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,195
You have a problem.
