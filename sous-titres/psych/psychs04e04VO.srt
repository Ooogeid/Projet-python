1
00:00:12,107 --> 00:00:15,356
- Thanks for coming in, Henry.
- Of course, father. Of course.

2
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:19,268
I wanted to discuss Shawn's attitude
in Sunday school lately.

3
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,139
I can't get through a lecture
without him questioning every detail.

4
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:25,171
Take this morning's, for instance,
on Noah's ark.

5
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:27,652
I'm sorry, dad.
But it doesn't make sense.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,487
What doesn't make sense, Shawn?

7
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:31,305
Lots of things.

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,423
Like if the ark was built
in the Middle East,

9
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:37,995
how did animals
like the koala bear get to it?

10
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:40,414
God helped them get there
using his almighty power.

11
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:42,333
That's exactly right, Gus.

12
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,669
Then why didn't he use those powers
to create the ark?

13
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:47,879
Wouldn't that be much faster
than getting Noah to build it?

14
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:52,635
Because god prefers his creations
accomplish things on their own.

15
00:00:53,114 --> 00:00:56,013
Unless those creations happen
to be koala bears, right?

16
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,185
Shawn, I think you're getting
a little too hung up on the details.

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,976
Really? You've always taught me
that details are everything in life.

18
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,498
- You're missing the point.
- How'd they keep all the lions

19
00:01:04,623 --> 00:01:05,897
from eating all the zebras?

20
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,319
Don't you think that the seven lions
would have gone through

21
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,444
at least seven zebras by then?

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,432
They could have easily eaten
seven zebras by then.

23
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,440
Lions eat close to 5,000 pounds
of meat a year.

24
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:26,323
Why don't we break this down?
What have we got here? We've got Noah,

25
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:29,130
we got a boatload full of animals.
What would be his M.O.?

26
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:31,903
This is not a detective case, Henry.
This is...

27
00:01:33,406 --> 00:01:36,186
Have you two ever considered visiting
the methodist church down the street?

28
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:37,346
It's quite nice.

29
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,608
Agatha!

30
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,142
- Wait!
- Get away!

31
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:16,594
Get... Stay back!

32
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,265
No, don't come any closer to me.

33
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,568
Stay back.

34
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,105
Come down.
I wanna help you.

35
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:25,056
How come you're so quiet?

36
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:28,023
- 'Cause I'm mad at you.
- What? How come?

37
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:29,527
How come? Really?

38
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:31,911
Does this conversation
sound familiar?

39
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:34,974
"Hey, Gus,
you wanna go to the beach today?"

40
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,467
"Are you sure you don't wanna check out
that jumper over at Saint Attalus?"

41
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,851
"It sounds like a straightforward
suicide to me. Are you peeing?"

42
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:45,415
"No, Shawn, I'm doing the dishes."
"Sounds like you're peeing, excuse me."

43
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,226
The nozzle was on spray mode.
And Shawn, I do not talk like that.

44
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:51,541
"Shawn, maybe we should stop
by Saint Attalus just to be sure.

45
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,543
"Besides,
there'll be all kinds of hotties

46
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:55,670
"running around
in catholic school girl uniforms."

47
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:56,729
What?

48
00:03:56,854 --> 00:03:57,836
Question...

49
00:03:58,854 --> 00:04:01,540
Where are all the girls
in the catholic school girl uniforms?

50
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:04,354
- There's one right over there.
- No, that is a male bagpiper.

51
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,199
- Why is this case so important to you?
- It happens to be intriguing to me.

52
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:09,629
Besides,
I'm here to see an old friend.

53
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:13,570
You randy little spaniel.

54
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:17,155
Why didn't you just say so?
Dude, you know I love playing wingman.

55
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,884
Just point her out,
we'll get this party started... tonight!

56
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,531
- Father Westley?
- Hello, gus.

57
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,755
Scratch the wingman thing, man,
I'm out.

58
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:33,688
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

59
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,563
- Been a long time.
- Yes, it has.

60
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:37,317
You remember Shawn Spencer,
don't you?

61
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,819
How could I forget?
He's my favorite little skeptic.

62
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,696
- My friends call me "skepty".
- No.

63
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:44,407
- They will.
- I was happy when you moved back here.

64
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,038
Well, you and I both.

65
00:04:46,163 --> 00:04:48,100
I was right in the midst
of shoveling five inches

66
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:50,122
of snow off my driveway in Buffalo.

67
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:52,625
When I got the call offering me
the position here.

68
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:56,337
I can't believe
you have become detectives.

69
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,046
Psychic detectives to be exact.

70
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:00,689
Actually, he's the psychic,
I'm a pharmaceutical salesman.

71
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:02,479
- We also do commercial jingles.
- No.

72
00:05:02,604 --> 00:05:03,604
We will.

73
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,264
Muffins.

74
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,602
- That's incredible.
- Thanks, I made it up just now.

75
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,918
- It's about the detective thing.
- That too.

76
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:16,544
Can you tell us about the tragedy
that occurred here last night?

77
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:17,961
If you two don't mind,

78
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:19,933
- we're asking questions.
- If one of them is,

79
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:22,310
"do the female students
wear catholic school girl uniforms?"

80
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:23,656
The answer to that is no.

81
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:24,614
Stay.

82
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:26,107
Father.

83
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,797
What else can you tell us
about the deceased?

84
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:31,609
Agatha was a model student.

85
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,984
Hard-working, well-liked, outgoing.

86
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:36,048
Then about three weeks ago
something changed.

87
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:39,171
She became extremely short tempered,
emotionally unstable.

88
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,882
Almost manic.
None of us knew what it was.

89
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:43,987
There was no history
of mental illness

90
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:46,241
and her friends say
she never touched drugs or alcohol.

91
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:48,614
Was she a fan
of the game <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>?

92
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:51,678
I know when I play, I become raving mad,
foaming at the mouth.

93
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:54,811
- I had to taser him once.
- Which I still feel was excessive.

94
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,952
St. Attalus doesn't allow
video games.

95
00:05:57,352 --> 00:05:59,241
They don't allow
school girl uniforms, either.

96
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:00,526
- Will you stop?
- No.

97
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:02,295
Will you just stop it?

98
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:05,041
Excuse us for a moment.
Detective...

99
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,639
- You know what I think?
- What?

100
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:08,663
- I think she was...
- You're wrong.

101
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:11,829
I'm sorry, I jumped the gun on that.
Please continue.

102
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,599
- I think she was murdered.
- Are you finished?

103
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:17,641
You're wrong.

104
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:20,044
My senses are telling me
that this girl committed suicide.

105
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,588
Well you can tell your senses
to kiss my sweet...

106
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:26,510
Love biscuits.

107
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,098
I don't know
if you made it less offensive.

108
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,622
Look, you have to admit
there's something weird here.

109
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:37,704
I mean, a girl like Agatha doesn't just
randomly go nuts and kill herself.

110
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:40,156
- There has to be an explanation.
- I have one.

111
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,567
Now is not the time, Peter.

112
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:44,987
I'd like to hear what he has to say.

113
00:06:49,314 --> 00:06:50,714
She was possessed.

114
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:02,222
I guess my video game theory
isn't looking so stupid right now.

115
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,816
Timing: Psych Team

116
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,322
Psych 404 - The Devil's in the Details
and in the Upstairs Bedroom

117
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:33,326
So let me get this straight.
You think that she was possessed?

118
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:36,482
As in floating above the bed,
head spinning, pukes up on the wall,

119
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:39,036
- that sort of thing?
- That's the Hollywood version.

120
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:42,872
The real life signs of possession
are often more subtle than that.

121
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:45,329
Though there have been some reports
of levitation in exorcisms.

122
00:07:45,454 --> 00:07:47,943
- That's true.
- You'll have to forgive father Westley,

123
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,595
he comes from an era of the church where
such beliefs were more widely accepted.

124
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:54,014
Today the majority
of us view the concept

125
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,725
of demonic possession
to be a little far-fetched.

126
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,019
Now, if you'll excuse me.

127
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,119
Father, you should come as well.

128
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:04,191
I'm speaking the truth.
You have to believe me.

129
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,585
I don't arrive
at such conclusions easily.

130
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,028
- Father Westley.
- Yes.

131
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,613
- You have a little shiver over there?
- No,

132
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:16,547
it's all this talk of devil
and possession.

133
00:08:16,672 --> 00:08:19,039
I don't scare easily, but that stuff
makes me shake in my boots.

134
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,959
I'm talking to Vick, she wants to know
if you two dopes are on the case.

135
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,283
Lassie, my friend,

136
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,878
- I'm afraid the answer is a big fat...
- Yes.

137
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:28,674
- And by yes, he means...
- Absolutely.

138
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,464
May I speak with you in the "stop openly
contradicting me" room, please?

139
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:32,981
You can tell her we'll take it.

140
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:34,642
What?

141
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:37,349
Since when do you accept a case
without running it by your partner?

142
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,724
- You do it every week.
- That makes it right?

143
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:43,647
Shawn, I know who killed that girl.

144
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:45,592
Who?

145
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,780
The devil.

146
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,864
So, I've been thinking...

147
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:55,605
If we end up catching the devil,
and he starts acting all devily,

148
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,293
I know what to do.
First, I'll buy a fiddle,

149
00:08:58,418 --> 00:09:00,909
play a quick tune
so he underestimates my ability,

150
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:04,035
then I'll challenge him to a wager...
He wins, he gets my soul.

151
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,170
I win, we get his cooperation.

152
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,216
I get it.
You don't believe in possessions.

153
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:10,318
But I do.
Especially after I saw

154
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:13,014
this police sketch of the suspect.

155
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,805
Last seen
at the local canned ham factory.

156
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,749
How long did it take you
to draw that?

157
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:21,165
A good half hour,
but I think it sold my point.

158
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,915
Look, I know father Westley's theory
is kind of crazy.

159
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,226
But if he believes it,
then I need to take it seriously.

160
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:29,284
- You know how much I look up to him.
- I look up to Brett Favre.

161
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:31,741
It doesn't mean
I believe everything he says.

162
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:34,731
All right, that's a bad example.
It's those tearful press conferences.

163
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:37,544
- They get me every time.
- I just wanna at least look into it.

164
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:39,293
But I can have your back on this.

165
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:41,542
I know, that's why
I wanna be the lead investigator.

166
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:44,192
- Since when do we have titles?
- Since you ordered business cards

167
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,514
that say,
"Shawn Spencer, lead investigator."

168
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,607
No, silly.

169
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:49,669
It's "lead...
Leadinvestigators."

170
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:53,087
A business I was thinking of starting
after we watched <i>Erin Brockovich</i>.

171
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:55,422
- Okay... fine.
- Thank you.

172
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:56,796
You're the <i>lead</i>.

173
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,918
- I'm in the back seat.
- Thank you.

174
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:01,684
Yeah, come in.

175
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:06,398
Come on in, boys.

176
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,697
Let me get another look
at you two, huh?

177
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:14,426
You two haven't changed a bit.

178
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:16,951
Have a seat, boys.

179
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:21,428
You know,
I want to apologize for earlier on.

180
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:24,933
You know, father Bard, like a lot
of the younger members of the church

181
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,585
isn't very tolerant towards views
that he doesn't agree with.

182
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,395
I actually want to ask you
about that.

183
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,006
What was it about Agatha
that made you think she was possessed?

184
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:36,016
Well, her extreme change
of personality for one.

185
00:10:36,524 --> 00:10:37,937
And that, coupled with...

186
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:41,009
the fact that I learned
that she'd been dabbling in the occult.

187
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,976
According to a friend,
she had been conducting seances

188
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,683
and using Ouija boards.

189
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:48,633
Both of which can be used
as calling cards

190
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:50,738
of sorts for demonic spirits.

191
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:52,567
Just for the record, father,

192
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,731
I use Ouija boards all the time
when I was a kid.

193
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:56,584
And never once was I pos...

194
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,592
You're gonna die up there.

195
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:05,978
Come on, man,
it's a line from the movie.

196
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,458
If Agatha was possessed,
why didn't you

197
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,628
- or someone else perform an exorcism?
- Believe me, I tried.

198
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:14,660
But I had to get
the approval of the headmaster

199
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:17,411
who happens to be father bard.

200
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:20,273
And he said no, of course.

201
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,347
I could have prevented her death.

202
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:25,756
That's an interesting theory, father.
But isn't it possible...

203
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:28,562
- Back seat.
- Agatha was a disturbed young girl?

204
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,448
- Back seat.
- Shawn, believe me,

205
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:33,066
I've dealt with enough disturbed people
to know the difference.

206
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:36,987
Look, I understand how this may seem
a bit illogical to you, but trust me,

207
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:39,238
possessions are real.

208
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,850
They're real.

209
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,260
I can personally attest to it.

210
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:57,758
This thing.

211
00:11:58,535 --> 00:11:59,343
Come on.

212
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,846
Let me know when you're ready
to bail on the possessed theory,

213
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,076
because I actually have a real idea
for why Agatha was acting crazy.

214
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,492
There will be no bailing.

215
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:08,894
I just found these articles online
about father Westley.

216
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,021
Did you know he's one of the foremost
experts on demonic possession in USA?

217
00:12:12,204 --> 00:12:15,256
He performed a bunch
of high profile exorcisms in the '70s,

218
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:17,569
including this one in Peru,
which lasted over a month.

219
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:19,885
I remember reading
about it as a kid.

220
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,532
In what?
This never actually happened <i>magazine</i>?

221
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:24,718
You mock, but check this out.

222
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:28,912
- Agatha's page.
- You friended a dead person.

223
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:30,915
No, I figured out her password
and logged on.

224
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:32,271
Let me guess.

225
00:12:32,396 --> 00:12:35,504
She's kind of gothy, so it's probably
something like "bauhaus"

226
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,880
- or "siouxsie" with an "x."
- Her birthday.

227
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,834
No, that's too obvious.
"Bjork"?

228
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,718
- The password is her birthday.
- Bravo for knowing Bjork's birthday.

229
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,405
Her own birthday.
Will you check this out?

230
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:47,963
Look at her status updates
from 3 weeks ago.

231
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:49,457
Notice how they're all cheery?

232
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:52,854
"Agatha is loving Santa Barbara ."
"Agatha played with the cutest puppy."

233
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,274
- I bet it was a labradoodle.
- You know that's right.

234
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,818
Look here now, the next day,
they completely change.

235
00:12:58,298 --> 00:13:01,738
"Agatha is over everybody!
Agatha just wants to be left alone."

236
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:04,091
That is when she became possessed.

237
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,287
Or...

238
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:07,410
- may I go now?
- Go ahead.

239
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,551
Or, that is precisely when she started
having man trouble, come on.

240
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:12,022
What are you talking about?

241
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:15,043
She was wearing a sweatshirt
that was at least a double XL.

242
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,999
That means she either spent a few hours
in one of those cartoon steam boxes

243
00:13:19,124 --> 00:13:21,800
that shrinks you a few sizes,
or it belonged to her boyfriend.

244
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,010
So why don't we check her photos

245
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,012
- and find out?
- Go ahead.

246
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,954
Man, how come every girl posts,
like, a million photos online

247
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,778
of her and friends
posing cheek to cheek? It's so lame.

248
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:34,867
Says the guy
who has that on his desk.

249
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,798
It's not posted online, gus.

250
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:39,287
Yet.

251
00:13:40,224 --> 00:13:41,153
Boring.

252
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,321
Boring.

253
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:45,912
I give you Agatha's boyfriend.

254
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:49,035
What's your name, smoochie?
Well, hello, Cameron.

255
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,352
We don't know
that they were having trouble.

256
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:52,329
Really?

257
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,788
Wednesday, the 5th:

258
00:13:54,913 --> 00:13:56,972
"Agatha is pissy at her boyfriend."

259
00:13:57,305 --> 00:14:00,051
9th:
"Agatha's tired of all the drama."

260
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:01,213
And the 14th:

261
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,717
"Agatha is now single."

262
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,677
That last one was two days
before she died.

263
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,795
I'll give you two possible scenarios.
One, Cameron dumped Agatha,

264
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,005
and she threw herself off a building
in despair. Or two,

265
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,607
Agatha dumped Cameron, he pushed her
off the building in a fit of rage.

266
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:18,349
Both of which are far more plausible

267
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:20,442
than the devil going down
to Santa Barbara.

268
00:14:21,422 --> 00:14:24,469
- Where are you going?
- We are going to talk to Cameron.

269
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:27,192
I'm going to crack this thing.
But first,

270
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,802
I'm gonna need
my <i>leadinvestigator</i> title back.

271
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:31,249
Thank you.

272
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,511
- What was her major?
- It's Christian studies.

273
00:14:40,636 --> 00:14:42,075
Christian studies.

274
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:44,138
Unbelievable.

275
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,300
Lassie has now beaten us
to a suspect.

276
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:48,365
I'm afraid history
will not look too kindly

277
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,803
on your tenure as <i>leadinvestigator</i>.

278
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:51,928
Hey, kids,

279
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,100
- what did we miss?
- This is Agatha's ex-boyfriend.

280
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:57,270
Let me guess.
Your name is Cameron.

281
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,773
- That's right.
- You guys broke up two days ago.

282
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,277
- And you weigh a solid 225.
- You're about 50 pounds off.

283
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:05,737
I got greedy.

284
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:09,065
Sorry to hear about the breakup.
Those can be tough.

285
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:11,910
Let me guess, you dumped her,
but she wouldn't accept it?

286
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:16,132
Agatha was the one
that broke up with me.

287
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:18,124
I was willing to make it work.

288
00:15:18,422 --> 00:15:21,072
Where were you last night
when she jumped?

289
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:23,725
I was in the desert at <i>Burning Man</i>.

290
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:26,037
I hope you can prove that, buddy.

291
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,448
Well, it looks like you guys
got this one covered.

292
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,980
Gus and I are going to throw back shots
and hit the confessional booth.

293
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:42,064
The dude's alibi is good.

294
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:45,569
There was a backpack and shoes
covered in sand from <i>Burning Man</i>.

295
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:48,071
Excuse me,
are you the grief counselors?

296
00:15:48,736 --> 00:15:50,824
As a matter of fact we are, Mary.

297
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:54,536
- How did you know that was my name?
- Just a hunch.

298
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,247
How's Cameron doing?
We're all really worried about him.

299
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,068
It's tough.
He's hanging in there.

300
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,668
I think he'll feel much better
once the medication kicks in.

301
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:05,130
- He's on medication?
- No, I am. Just an antacid.

302
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:08,678
Is there anyone else you can think of
who's taking the news of Agatha's death

303
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:10,203
particularly hard?

304
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:12,012
Family or close friends?

305
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:16,099
You know about Lucy?

306
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:18,490
Yes, of course. She charges,

307
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:20,240
what, five cents
for psychiatric help.

308
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:23,133
And if she ever asks you
to kick a football, you say no.

309
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:24,691
We don't know about Lucy.

310
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,693
She was
one of Agatha's best friends.

311
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:29,124
She saw the whole thing happen.

312
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:30,949
Agatha died in her arms.

313
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,392
Really?

314
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:37,996
You wouldn't happen to know
where we could find this Lucy?

315
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:56,556
Hello, Mrs. Ryan.

316
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:59,684
My name is Shawn, this is Shawn.
No relation.

317
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,686
We're grief counselors
from the school.

318
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:03,605
Thank God. Please come in.

319
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:11,279
I'm sorry, I thought you were
just another pair of detectives.

320
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:13,811
There were detectives here earlier?

321
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:16,368
Yes, two by the name
O'Hara and Lassiter.

322
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:19,120
- Dude, you're on fire.
- They didn't get much.

323
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:21,164
Lucy was really withdrawn.

324
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,906
You two couldn't have come
at a better time.

325
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:26,681
It's like she's a shell
of her former self.

326
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,429
Do you think she has PTSD?

327
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:33,612
I'm afraid this is far more serious
than a mere menstrual issue.

328
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:36,589
It could be
post traumatic stress disorder.

329
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:38,986
But we won't know for sure
until we talk with her.

330
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:40,475
In private, if you don't mind.

331
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:43,053
Of course.
Please, go on up...

332
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,600
Her room is the first left
at the top of the stairs.

333
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,017
Can I get either of you something?

334
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:52,779
A diet coke, some garlic hummus,
and the new <i>Tv Guide</i>, if you have it.

335
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:27,856
Mrs. Ryan,

336
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:31,887
is your daughter
by any chance an expert yogi?

337
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:34,748
Or an olympic gymnast, perhaps?

338
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:38,003
No, why?

339
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:41,311
There's no particular reason.

340
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,393
Hey, Lucy.

341
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:53,128
That was some pretty sweet
spider walking.

342
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:58,386
We were hoping you could shed
some light on what happened last night.

343
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:00,047
Die.

344
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:05,351
We heard you lost your best friend.
That's terrible. We're so sorry.

345
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:07,979
Both of you die.

346
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,878
There's something wrong with her.

347
00:19:12,003 --> 00:19:14,067
She just saw
her best friend kill herself.

348
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:18,087
Imagine how you'd be if you saw me
torn apart by a pride of angry lions.

349
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:20,575
I'm having second thoughts
about our spring safari trip.

350
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:21,774
Hear me out.

351
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:25,055
Agatha jumped off to kill herself
and the demon that was inside of her.

352
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,875
Right before she died, the demon
transferred out of her and into Lucy.

353
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,711
- Just like in <i>The Exorcist</i>.
- You're basing this on a fiction.

354
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,422
You once tried to solve a case
using the movie <i>Pretty In Pink</i>.

355
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,812
That's completely different,
<i>Pretty In Pink</i> is more of a docu-drama.

356
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,897
All right, fine,
let's say she is possessed.

357
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,639
How come she isn't
projectile vomiting

358
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:46,483
and spouting stuff in languages
that she doesn't know?

359
00:19:52,745 --> 00:19:53,817
You mean like that?

360
00:20:02,148 --> 00:20:04,661
How many foreign languages
does your daughter speak?

361
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:05,912
Just french.

362
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:08,269
In your fudge.

363
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:09,845
She was speaking german.

364
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,372
- How do you know that?
- I went to college.

365
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,391
Lucy, please calm down.

366
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:18,603
Admit it, the only reason
why you won't accept possession

367
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:21,135
as a real possibility is because
Father Westley came up with it.

368
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:24,332
- You've always had a problem with him.
- I don't have a problem with him.

369
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,634
He has a problem.

370
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,101
Because I have the ability
to see things in more than one way.

371
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,820
You clearly can't see things
objectively right now.

372
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:33,877
That's it, I'm taking back over
as lead investigator.

373
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:39,815
Sorry, buddy.
Only one title switch per investigation.

374
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,198
It's in the fine print
on the back of my business card.

375
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:46,995
Come on, chill out, man.
I'm just messing with you.

376
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:48,764
Don't punch me, Shawn.

377
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,374
- That was way harder.
- Well.

378
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:53,877
- You want to do this?
- Come on.

379
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,322
- Right now?
- Come on.

380
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,597
- Come on, baby girl.
- Come on, come on.

381
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:00,689
Excuse me!

382
00:21:00,814 --> 00:21:03,214
What kind of grief counselors
are you?

383
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:05,597
We're very progressive.

384
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,724
This is an exercise that we do.

385
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:10,310
It helps us empathize
with your daughter's pain.

386
00:21:10,943 --> 00:21:12,687
Right, watch.

387
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:20,194
I'm now going
to turn things over to the lead

388
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,012
grief counselor, Shawn.

389
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:24,782
You're on your own.

390
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:35,460
All right.

391
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,767
Where's is it?
Where is my Xbox?

392
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,673
- Where is it?
- What are you talking about?

393
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:44,087
Dad, this is not the day
to mess with me.

394
00:21:44,212 --> 00:21:45,962
I can assure you of that.

395
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:48,973
I can't believe
you stole this from me.

396
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,965
I prefer the term "repossessed,"
in that you reneged on our deal.

397
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,127
I painted your house,
just like we agreed.

398
00:21:54,252 --> 00:21:57,019
Minus the spots behind the bushes
that no one ever sees,

399
00:21:57,144 --> 00:21:59,192
and the windows,
and of course, the entire back.

400
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:01,819
That stays here until you're finished.
End of story.

401
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,409
Let me guess.
Relationship trouble?

402
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,206
- I hate it when we fight.
- I'm sure she feels the same way.

403
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,500
I'm not talking about Abigail,
I mean Gus.

404
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:16,876
So am I.

405
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:19,651
I was starting to make some progress
on this case we're working on,

406
00:22:19,776 --> 00:22:22,924
and he refuses to let go
of this ridiculous theory that he has.

407
00:22:24,506 --> 00:22:26,386
Do you remember
my ex-partner, Stevie?

408
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:29,503
There was this one time
when Stevie was convinced

409
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:33,601
that break-ins was being committed
by an ape who had escaped from the zoo.

410
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:37,432
I thought he had lost his mind.
But I went down the road with him on it.

411
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,524
And it turned out to be
a good move, you know why?

412
00:22:39,874 --> 00:22:41,434
I don't know. Headlines?

413
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:43,736
"Cops stop monkey business:
criminals go bananas"?

414
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,476
I'm trying to make a point here.

415
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:47,865
The point is
it turned out to be a good move

416
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:51,536
because from that point on
Stevie always supported my ideas.

417
00:22:53,362 --> 00:22:55,612
You get your partner's back, Shawn.

418
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,376
Even if it means putting
your doubts aside for a minute.

419
00:23:11,726 --> 00:23:13,425
What are you doing here?

420
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,776
I came back to help my partner.

421
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:17,669
Thanks, buddy.

422
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:19,955
But I already called someone.

423
00:23:20,676 --> 00:23:21,676
Who?

424
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,029
I appreciate you keeping
an open mind about this.

425
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:38,791
No problem, buddy. Tell me if...

426
00:23:39,904 --> 00:23:42,837
this girl turns out to be possessed
and the whole exorcism thing works...

427
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:45,006
Where does that leave us?

428
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,925
It's over, we know
why Agatha killed herself.

429
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:50,555
Right.

430
00:23:51,184 --> 00:23:52,814
Now when it doesn't work...

431
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:55,039
I'm sorry, if it doesn't work...

432
00:23:55,806 --> 00:23:58,102
you promise me that we can go back
to doing things my way?

433
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,813
- And what way is that again?
- You know,

434
00:24:01,248 --> 00:24:03,273
follow a few leads,
make some inappropriate jokes,

435
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:06,235
I'll remember and then we'll tip off
the police using a little bit of this.

436
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,434
- You got it.
- All right.

437
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,959
I want both you boys
in there with me

438
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,845
in the event
she needs to be restrained.

439
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,205
Have either one of you
ever been involved in an exorcism?

440
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,625
You need to be strong in there.

441
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:22,279
Understand?

442
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,110
All right, let's bring it in.

443
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:32,678
- This isn't a ball game, boys.
- You.

444
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,722
I always try to start
with a little humor.

445
00:24:35,068 --> 00:24:37,492
Check this one out.
A priest, a rabb...

446
00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:38,518
It's over now.

447
00:24:39,918 --> 00:24:40,918
Let's go.

448
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:45,525
Now.

449
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:46,694
Right now.

450
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:58,379
Demons will do everything in their power
to keep from getting expelled.

451
00:24:58,504 --> 00:24:59,831
And their powers are great.

452
00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:02,041
And they know everything about us...

453
00:25:02,444 --> 00:25:05,005
Facts, dreams, inner desires.

454
00:25:05,307 --> 00:25:07,338
And they won't hesitate
to use them against you.

455
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,019
What's going on?

456
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,280
We're here to help.

457
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:18,174
But I don't need any help.
I'm fine.

458
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,017
See that? She's fine.
Great work.

459
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,186
- Who's up for some fro-yo?
- She's lying...

460
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,219
to get us to leave.

461
00:25:24,344 --> 00:25:27,118
If I woke up and there were two dudes
and a priest standing over me,

462
00:25:27,243 --> 00:25:28,343
I'd lie too.

463
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:30,444
Holy water.

464
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:33,739
- In the name of the Father, the Son...
- Stop it! Stop it!

465
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:36,242
the Holy Ghost...
Hold her down.

466
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,744
Now! Hold her down.

467
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,875
You're okay, you're okay.

468
00:25:46,904 --> 00:25:47,954
You're hot.

469
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,174
Thank you.
You're not so bad yourself.

470
00:25:51,662 --> 00:25:53,676
Maybe a little...
Well, young.

471
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:56,057
She's using lies to distract you.

472
00:25:56,182 --> 00:25:58,472
Well, it's not fair
to assume she's lying.

473
00:25:58,641 --> 00:25:59,541
Silence!

474
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,017
Be gone, Satan!

475
00:26:01,402 --> 00:26:03,820
Inventor and master of all deceit,

476
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,897
- be gone!
- All right, you know what?

477
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,032
Carson D.'s got
Simon Baker on tonight.

478
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,196
That's a can't-miss, okay?
I'm gonna go, you can keep exorcisizing.

479
00:26:13,715 --> 00:26:15,615
I know about Mr. Reno.

480
00:26:18,084 --> 00:26:19,160
What did you say?

481
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,205
He was
your seventh grade shop teacher.

482
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:24,415
You placed a tack on his chair.

483
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,753
How did you...
Did you tell her that?

484
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,173
You're the one
who gave him blood poisoning.

485
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:35,229
- No, we don't know that for sure.
- Get him out of here, Gus.

486
00:26:35,354 --> 00:26:38,512
The man made
a living handling rusty metals.

487
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:41,265
Father Westley,
what in God's name is going on in here?

488
00:26:46,092 --> 00:26:47,386
Good luck, guys.

489
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,869
You sure you didn't say
anything to her about Mr. Reno?

490
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:09,639
Stay here. It's okay.

491
00:27:11,189 --> 00:27:13,965
The most high God commands you!

492
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:17,612
<i>Nomine patris, et filii,
et spiritus sancti...</i>

493
00:27:23,713 --> 00:27:24,813
Double whoa.

494
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:31,970
It's over.

495
00:27:32,823 --> 00:27:33,923
She's clean.

496
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:42,368
- How's she doing?
- She's exhausted and a bit confused.

497
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:45,329
I have to say,
she really seems like her old self.

498
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,373
I can't thank you all enough.

499
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,241
It's Father Westley
who deserves the credit.

500
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:52,003
I was just doing the Lord's work.

501
00:27:52,432 --> 00:27:53,921
Thank you, Father.

502
00:28:01,636 --> 00:28:05,568
There has to be an explanation
for why Agatha was acting nuts.

503
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:07,718
- Tell me you have something there.
- I wish.

504
00:28:07,843 --> 00:28:10,643
Her toxicology report
just came back negative.

505
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:12,989
Are you getting a premonition?

506
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:14,664
No, just a head rush.

507
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,518
Happens to me quite a bit
when I'm sleep deprived.

508
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:21,032
Spencer, you're wrong about this one.
That girl was murdered.

509
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,951
- That's not humanly possible.
- And how come?

510
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,537
- Because you think she was murdered.
- I guess we'll see.

511
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,164
- We will see.
- We'll see.

512
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,415
I just said that.


513
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:30,584
Boys.

514
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:37,048
So, if she had any drug in her system,
it would show up on this report?

515
00:28:39,394 --> 00:28:42,636
No, just the ones they test for.
The standard narcotics, why?

516
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,104
Do you have a specific drug in mind?

517
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,540
Not yet.

518
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:49,715
... bursts of energy.

519
00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:51,896
Hey, Gus. What is up?

520
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:53,647
Why are you sitting at my desk?

521
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,223
Just working on my status updates.
Check this one out...

522
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:58,550
"Shawn Spencer
is trading in his Chevy

523
00:28:58,675 --> 00:29:02,034
"for a Cadillac-a-lac-a-lac-a-lac."

524
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:03,491
Then why...

525
00:29:03,832 --> 00:29:05,477
- Then why were you...
- What?

526
00:29:05,602 --> 00:29:07,413
Why are you reading
my index of medications?

527
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:08,746
Because it's hilarious.

528
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:12,083
The section on medications that treat
urinary infections made me pee my pants.

529
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:14,752
Which is ironic
if you think about it.

530
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:18,172
- You're on to something, aren't you?
- Yep. Got to go. Thanks for the cake.

531
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,791
That's a sponge to moisten stamps.

532
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:26,364
Dad? You know I hate coming here,
but I need more partner advice.

533
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:36,273
Well, this is sad.

534
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,818
You haven't gone to bed, have you?

535
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:41,195
I tried, but it's this game.
It keeps calling me back.

536
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,824
It lets you feel like a cop without
all the guilt after you shoot someone.

537
00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:50,079
What are you doing?

538
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:54,935
Kids your age should not be cooped up
inside playing video games all day.

539
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,920
You should be outdoors feeding pigeons,
and driving with your blinker on.

540
00:29:58,092 --> 00:29:59,588
What do you want, Shawn?

541
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,588
What do you want, Shawn?

542
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,842
You remember I asked you what you should
do when you think your partner's wrong?

543
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,136
What do you do
when you know they are?

544
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:08,723
That's simple...

545
00:30:09,121 --> 00:30:10,710
You tell them the truth.

546
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,934
But in the most
respectful way possible.

547
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,606
You were wrong.

548
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:20,860
Wrong, wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong, wrong. Finger-guns.

549
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:22,917
Wrong. Wrong.

550
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:25,481
- Wrong on your weenie.
- Shawn, put down the finger-guns.

551
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:27,499
Agatha wasn't possessed.
She was drugged.

552
00:30:27,624 --> 00:30:29,777
I saw the toxicology report,
she was clean.

553
00:30:29,902 --> 00:30:33,123
The preliminary report, sure.
But they don't test for everything.

554
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,366
I made a list of medications
with psychological side effects

555
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:38,057
and had them test for those as well.

556
00:30:38,182 --> 00:30:40,171
And guess which one
they found in her system.

557
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:43,841
L-dopa.

558
00:30:44,265 --> 00:30:46,635
- The parkinson's medication?
- Correctamundo.

559
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:49,686
And do you know what happens
to someone who takes L-dopa

560
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:51,731
that doesn't have Parkinson's?

561
00:30:52,007 --> 00:30:54,379
They experience
extreme emotional states,

562
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:57,420
disillusionment,
and uncontrollable bursts of energy.

563
00:30:57,545 --> 00:30:59,547
What's up?
Sound like anyone we know?

564
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:02,182
That doesn't explain the lamp,
or how Lucy knew the German,

565
00:31:02,307 --> 00:31:03,371
or the tack story.

566
00:31:03,496 --> 00:31:05,654
All right, in order.
The lamp...

567
00:31:06,316 --> 00:31:08,616
The chick was flailing about,
she was grabbing at everything.

568
00:31:11,178 --> 00:31:12,244
The German...

569
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:17,572
Etcetera is a line
from <i>Run Lola Run</i>,

570
00:31:17,697 --> 00:31:20,370
which according to her page
is her favorite movie.

571
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:23,299
I mean, it's a nice little film,
but favorite? Really?

572
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,674
It ends in the middle
and starts all over again...

573
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,411
Anyway, speaking
of personal networking sites,

574
00:31:28,536 --> 00:31:31,932
I forgot that our good friend stumpy
from grade school

575
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,975
posted the following message
on my page a few months back.

576
00:31:35,557 --> 00:31:37,970
"Hello, Shawn.
Remember when you put that tack

577
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:40,949
"on Mr. Reno's chair
and gave him blood poisoning?"

578
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:42,369
Stumpy wasn't british.

579
00:31:42,494 --> 00:31:44,744
My page is open for public viewing

580
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,746
so that our potential clients
can check us out.

581
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,914
Clearly she went onto it
after we stopped by yesterday.

582
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,182
So, you think they were just
popping Parkinson's pills?

583
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:54,995
They were being given
to them secretly.

584
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,057
By who?

585
00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:58,120
Someone with access
to the medication...

586
00:31:58,245 --> 00:32:00,376
Which brings me to the bad news.

587
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,367
Father Westley?

588
00:32:06,262 --> 00:32:07,799
He was diagnosed ten years ago.

589
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,763
I'm sorry, dude.
It all checks out.

590
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:13,221
- Guess what he takes.
- L-dopa.

591
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:14,514
Every day.

592
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:17,268
No. There's no way.

593
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,813
Think about it, Gus.

594
00:32:21,182 --> 00:32:24,619
Back in the'70s, when disco
and exorcisms were all the rage,

595
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:25,692
he was the man.

596
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,155
Strutting around, exorcising demons
in his polyester cassock.

597
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,242
Cut to 30 years later,
and all the younger members

598
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,347
of the church treat him
like a crazy old man.

599
00:32:34,472 --> 00:32:38,872
So what does he do? He tries to create
a possession to prove them all wrong.

600
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:43,085
He drugs the chick with the Ouija board.
That goes terribly awry.

601
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,713
He realizes he has one last chance.

602
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,494
When he learns that Lucy
was next to her when she died.

603
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:52,303
So he makes her possessed.

604
00:32:58,703 --> 00:33:00,394
I really am sorry, buddy.

605
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,991
- You're doing okay?
- Oh, I can't complain.

606
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:17,051
My vows of poverty and abstinence

607
00:33:17,176 --> 00:33:20,581
that I took 40 years ago prepared me
quite well for prison life.

608
00:33:25,741 --> 00:33:27,504
You believe I'm innocent, right?

609
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:28,994
I do.

610
00:33:29,518 --> 00:33:31,450
But I need your help to prove it.

611
00:33:31,832 --> 00:33:34,051
Do you know anyone
who had access to your medication?

612
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:36,340
Well, I suppose there were a lot.

613
00:33:36,465 --> 00:33:40,113
You know, I kept it
in the top drawer of my desk,

614
00:33:40,238 --> 00:33:41,934
I rarely ever locked my office.

615
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,026
Do you know of anyone
who may have had it out for Agatha?

616
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,409
Actually, someone does come to mind.

617
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:58,410
Who?

618
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,746
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

619
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:03,665
They revealed it
to me during confession.

620
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,060
You can't make
this exception just once?

621
00:34:06,185 --> 00:34:08,600
As a man of the cloth,
you know I can't.

622
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,673
How about a man of the orange cloth?

623
00:34:11,904 --> 00:34:13,745
Your freedom is at stake here.

624
00:34:14,437 --> 00:34:17,971
I have total faith that the Lord
will get me through this, Gus.

625
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:24,143
Until then, I have my Bible
to give me strength.

626
00:34:24,836 --> 00:34:27,272
Proverbs 11:6.

627
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:31,402
It's been especially
comforting to me as of late.

628
00:34:33,514 --> 00:34:34,525
Time's up.

629
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:37,017
Dad?

630
00:34:47,557 --> 00:34:49,842
- Is that you?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

631
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:51,710
But there's no reason to come down.

632
00:34:51,835 --> 00:34:55,617
I'm just here... I'm just here
to finish up the painting.

633
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,971
Where have you been?
I need to talk to you.

634
00:34:59,678 --> 00:35:01,849
- Now is not the best time.
- Father Westley is innocent.

635
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:02,680
What?

636
00:35:02,805 --> 00:35:04,939
Someone confided in him
that they had it out for Agatha.

637
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:07,771
But he can't say who it is because
it was told to him during confession.

638
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:11,984
What are you saying? You have a hunch
based on unverifiable information?

639
00:35:12,432 --> 00:35:14,455
That's what you use
to solve every case.

640
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,196
Okay, that stings.
It's true, though.

641
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,354
What else did he say?

642
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:21,287
He did say he's been getting strength
from a particular proverb.

643
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:24,246
All right, fine. Let's do a quick list.
"You can't teach an old dog new tricks"?

644
00:35:24,587 --> 00:35:26,408
"A bird in the hand's
worth two in the bush"?

645
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:30,169
- "If it's brown, flush it down"?
- Shawn, proverbs 11:6. The Bible.

646
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,088
- What's going on in here?
- Nothing is going on.

647
00:35:36,213 --> 00:35:37,529
Where is your Bible?

648
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:41,096
I don't know.
That's a good question.

649
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:42,868
- Where did I put it?
- Gosh.

650
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,096
- Really?
- Here, let me see that.

651
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,274
All right, look, this is just a shot
in the dark, but I think maybe... Maybe

652
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:54,538
Father Westley was trying
to tell you something

653
00:35:54,663 --> 00:35:56,654
with the proverb that he mentioned.

654
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,028
Where's the table of contents
in this thing?

655
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,287
Tell you what, you do this,

656
00:36:01,412 --> 00:36:05,451
I am gonna go prime the outside,
'cause I'm gonna paint!

657
00:36:05,576 --> 00:36:08,276
If you leave with that bag,
I will pull out my gun.

658
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:10,151
All right, do you know what?

659
00:36:10,276 --> 00:36:12,211
You need help.

660
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,803
I know. I know.

661
00:36:15,485 --> 00:36:17,326
What's happening to me?

662
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:18,901
Okay, here it is.

663
00:36:19,026 --> 00:36:21,053
"The righteousness of the upright
will save them,

664
00:36:21,282 --> 00:36:23,931
the unfaithful will be trapped
by evil desires."

665
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:26,808
The unfaithful...

666
00:36:29,075 --> 00:36:31,648
- will be trapped by evil desires.
- That's good.

667
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,948
- What up?
- Hello, Cameron.

668
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,147
Hey, guys.

669
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:44,535
What are you doing here?

670
00:36:45,192 --> 00:36:47,641
Unfortunately, we're here to tell you
that you are under arrest

671
00:36:47,766 --> 00:36:50,587
for possession
of an illegal hot plate.

672
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:52,774
What?

673
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:55,468
Just messing with you, man.

674
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:58,159
We were in the neighborhood.
We thought we'd come by and say hey.

675
00:37:00,508 --> 00:37:02,213
Are we interrupting something?

676
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:03,387
Well, actually...

677
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:11,462
- What's going on?
- Put a sock on the door next time.

678
00:37:11,587 --> 00:37:14,120
Lucy and I were just
comforting each other.

679
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:17,587
Is that what the church
is calling it these days?

680
00:37:17,712 --> 00:37:19,111
You tell us what's going on?

681
00:37:19,312 --> 00:37:21,211
I know who was drugging Agatha,

682
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:23,608
and it wasn't Father Westley.

683
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,451
- You don't think it was me?
- What do you think, Lassie?

684
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:27,774
Absolutely.

685
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:30,509
Great, now I know
for sure that it was...

686
00:37:31,036 --> 00:37:31,927
Lucy.

687
00:37:33,323 --> 00:37:35,273
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

688
00:37:35,398 --> 00:37:36,314
Admit it.

689
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:39,087
You wanted Cam the whole time
that he and Agatha were together.

690
00:37:39,743 --> 00:37:41,077
That's so not true.

691
00:37:41,202 --> 00:37:43,649
Yeah, Lucy and I
have always just been friends.

692
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,488
Cam, don't be so naive.
Men and women can't be friends.

693
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,097
<i>When Harry met Sally</i>.

694
00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:51,810
It also taught us
that women often fake orgasms.

695
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:55,105
Lucy, you wanted him badly.

696
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,940
So badly it was
filling you with guilt.

697
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:59,898
So much guilt that you had
to go and confess to someone

698
00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:02,068
in order to get it off your chest,
isn't that right?

699
00:38:02,474 --> 00:38:04,405
Did Father Westley
tell you about that?

700
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:07,284
You just did.

701
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:08,899
I know how this movie ends.

702
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,947
She desperately
wanted them to break up.

703
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:14,212
So she stole
Father Westley's medication

704
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:15,918
and secretly gave it to Agatha

705
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:19,504
hoping the poor girl would act so crazy
that Cameron would dump her.

706
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,965
But Agatha ended up dumping him,
but that didn't matter.

707
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,522
Because Lucy got what Lucy wanted.
But there was a problem.

708
00:38:25,647 --> 00:38:27,938
The medication
made Agatha too crazy.

709
00:38:31,462 --> 00:38:33,060
And then Lucy was trapped.

710
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:36,399
'Cause it was only a matter of time
before someone uncovered your plan.

711
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:38,777
Then she overheard
Father Westley's proclamation.

712
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,402
She was possessed.

713
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,075
And she figured she had the perfect
thing to throw us off the trail.

714
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:47,962
Props to you for your performance
as a possessed girl.

715
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:49,557
Linda Blair would be proud.

716
00:38:49,682 --> 00:38:52,960
And now you can do your best impression
of her inchained heat.

717
00:38:53,085 --> 00:38:54,085
And?

718
00:38:54,296 --> 00:38:55,713
- Red heat.
- Right.

719
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:56,962
Two prison movies!

720
00:38:58,837 --> 00:38:59,753
Is this true?

721
00:39:06,296 --> 00:39:08,524
I never meant to hurt her, honest.

722
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:12,513
I just knew
that she wasn't right for you.

723
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:21,444
Let's go.

724
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:39,239
Okay, you're up.

725
00:39:40,456 --> 00:39:44,339
Look, I'm having second thoughts
about this whole confession thing.

726
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,152
- You promised me you'd go just once.
- I know, I know I did.

727
00:39:47,277 --> 00:39:49,930
But it's Father Westley,
and he knows me.

728
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,722
And it just... It feels weird.

729
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:54,578
Trust me, you'll feel
better about yourself.

730
00:39:55,285 --> 00:39:56,130
Go on.

731
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:00,523
Wrong door.

732
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:13,368
Bless me father for I have sinned,
it's been...

733
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:16,429
Carry the one...

734
00:40:18,744 --> 00:40:21,251
15 years since my last confession.

735
00:40:23,397 --> 00:40:24,671
That's not very priestly...

736
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:26,777
I don't think.

737
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,472
Whatever.
As far as the sinning goes,

738
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:33,540
I'm a little unclear as to
what's still on the list nowadays.

739
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:36,266
I'm assuming that stealing
is still a no-no, right?

740
00:40:36,597 --> 00:40:38,393
- That's correct.
- Okay, and then greed?

741
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:41,187
- Impure thoughts?
- Big time.

742
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,940
You have any place you need to be soon?
This could take a while.

743
00:40:44,983 --> 00:40:47,148
Let's start with the lying.
I do it all the time.

744
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:50,096
But here's the good news:
nature of my job.

745
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:51,990
Yeah, go on.

746
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:56,368
I'd rather switch over to stealing,
if you don't mind.

747
00:40:56,538 --> 00:41:00,293
I don't do it often, but something's
been gnawing at me lately.

748
00:41:01,557 --> 00:41:03,311
Gus, can you hear me?

749
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,774
Here's the thing,
I've been stealing food

750
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,576
that Gus hides in his desk
and eating it.

751
00:41:12,028 --> 00:41:14,821
And then blaming it
on the cleaning lady Onelia.

752
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:17,151
I knew it!
I knew it!

753
00:41:17,587 --> 00:41:18,586
Damn it.

754
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:21,186
Was that word a sin?

755
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,187
I'm sorry.

756
00:41:23,178 --> 00:41:26,619
One thing I wasn't lying about
was the commercial jingles.

757
00:41:27,325 --> 00:41:30,101
Perhaps, I could help the church out
with a new theme.

758
00:41:32,714 --> 00:41:36,868
Boom, boom, boom wafers

759
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:39,913
No, that's not it.

760
00:41:40,277 --> 00:41:42,124
That's not the one.
Let me try this.

761
00:41:43,772 --> 00:41:50,257
Boom, boom, boom holy ghost

762
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:54,977
I like that.
Holy ghost.
