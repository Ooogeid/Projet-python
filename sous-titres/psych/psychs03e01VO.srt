1
00:00:00,075 --> 00:00:02,291
- Previously, on psych...
- I need to talk to you.

2
00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:04,045
- Just say it. Say what it is.
- I don't wanna feel guilty

3
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,576
about moving on with my life.
Your mother's not a part of it anymore.

4
00:00:06,577 --> 00:00:09,570
Look, I don't care what you do, okay?
I don't care!

5
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:13,840
Mom.

6
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:32,026
Dispatch, we've located
the stolen vehicle.

7
00:00:32,154 --> 00:00:33,807
Occupants inside.

8
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:35,567
Approaching now.

9
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:37,654
10-4. Proceed with caution.

10
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:39,476
Henry.

11
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:42,397
- You don't want to do this.
- I don't have a choice, ray.

12
00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:44,056
Think of the consequences.

13
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:46,555
We're way past consequences.

14
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:48,783
This needs to end tonight.

15
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,085
It's my neighbor's car.
We were gonna put it back.

16
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:11,636
- It was just a dare.
- Is there a problem here, officer?

17
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:14,921
You wanted my attention, shawn.
You got it, buddy.

18
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:17,093
Wait, you guys know each other?

19
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:19,268
Yeah, he's sort of my dad.

20
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:23,117
I'm afraid
i'm gonna have to ask for that

21
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:25,976
- world's greatest dad mug back.
- You just keep talking, shawn.

22
00:01:25,977 --> 00:01:27,270
You keep talking.

23
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,246
Don't worry, I will. Like
when I read you your rights.

24
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:31,670
I have rights.
That'll be new and fun.

25
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:34,106
- What am I gonna tell your mother?
- I don't know.

26
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:36,266
You think you can get
ahold of her new phone number?

27
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:38,304
I hope it was worth it, smart-ass.

28
00:01:38,318 --> 00:01:40,501
This officially ends
your chance of being a cop.

29
00:01:40,573 --> 00:01:44,132
Let's be honest. I gave up wanting
to be like you a long time ago.

30
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:46,091
That's it! Somebody book him!

31
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:49,016
You... beanpole. Get over here.
Fingerprint him now!

32
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:52,073
Oh, I'm so... I'm sorry. Me?

33
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:55,129
Never mind, rookie.
I'll do it myself.

34
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:05,882
Dude, I'm freaking out.
You have to help me.

35
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:08,042
- What's wrong?
- My mom's here.

36
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,463
- She's back in the country?
- Back in the country? Try...

37
00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:11,888
try back in this city.

38
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:13,818
Try downstairs in my dad's kitchen.

39
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:16,572
- Where are you?
- Hiding out in my bedroom.

40
00:02:16,656 --> 00:02:18,122
Oh, my god. Holy crap.

41
00:02:18,123 --> 00:02:20,712
I just found an entire,
unopened box of shrinky dinks.

42
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:23,131
You're hiding in your bedroom
because your mom came to visit?

43
00:02:23,132 --> 00:02:24,555
Dude, you've got problems.

44
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:25,897
Are you hearing what I'm saying?

45
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:29,140
My mom is standing downstairs
in my dad's kitchen,

46
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:31,269
laughing it up,
having a grand old time.

47
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,748
You don't think
that's a little weird?

48
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:34,022
And you're unhappy she's here.

49
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:36,720
No, I'm not unhappy she's... here.

50
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:39,705
I don't know, I haven't seen her
in three years.

51
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:41,368
She used to...

52
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:43,861
- Tell me everything.
- What is she doing here?

53
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,082
- Working.
- For the police department?

54
00:02:46,135 --> 00:02:47,688
I guess. I don't know.

55
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:50,281
I haven't... found out much,
because, apparently,

56
00:02:50,282 --> 00:02:52,875
it's 1988 in my house,
and no one felt the need

57
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:54,638
to tell me anything. But...

58
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:57,228
i know my dad
is behind all of this.

59
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:00,216
Oh, my god.

60
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:03,231
Dude, did you know I had a furby?

61
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:06,673
Shawn, I have no time for this.
I've got my own problems.

62
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:08,901
I have to go see frankjim ogletree.

63
00:03:08,991 --> 00:03:11,382
Frankjim ogletree? Is that
a person or a hippotamus?

64
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:13,063
He's the new regional sales manager,

65
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:15,268
my immediate boss, and a tyrant.

66
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,077
They call him the little pinochet.

67
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:18,649
That's too abstract.

68
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:21,343
Why don't they just call him
jerk pants or suck mcjones.

69
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:24,109
They're m.i.t. Guys, shawn.
Now go face your parents.

70
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,879
You've been wanting
to see your mom forever.

71
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,727
And tell her I'm coming by
for some jell-o cake.

72
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:29,278
Holy... dude!

73
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:32,035
I just found a pristine
issue ofdynamitemagazine.

74
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:33,735
Square pegson the cover.

75
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:35,732
Hold on, I'm gonna read
"bummers" to you.

76
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:39,928
The cheese knife
is in the same place, right?

77
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:42,317
Yeah, it's right there. You want me
to give you a hand, hon?

78
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:44,396
Did you just call me honey?

79
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:47,408
I did not. I was going to say...

80
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:50,922
- Hunchback.
- Oh, shawny, look at this.

81
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:54,078
Not only does your father
own a very expensive bottle

82
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,872
of bordeaux, he hand-made
little cucumber sandwiches.

83
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:58,332
Do you believe that?

84
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,235
He is just chock full
of surprises today.

85
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:04,126
What? I'm allowed
to expand my horizons, right?

86
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:10,801
I'm so glad to see you, mom.

87
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:12,732
What are you doing in town?

88
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:15,370
Well, some police departments
occasionally call me up

89
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,557
to come back
and do psych evaluations.

90
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:19,428
How long have you known about this?

91
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:21,315
Not long. I almost didn't do it.

92
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:23,231
I changed my mind
at the last second.

93
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:27,618
I'm doing santa barbara p.d.,
a few in san diego the bay area.

94
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:30,124
When are
our dinner reservations, henry?

95
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,485
There's dinner plans tonight!

96
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:34,704
- You can make it, right?
- Of course he can make it.

97
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:37,558
Of course I will come. I just...

98
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:40,259
Need to cancel a date.
But that is not a big deal.

99
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,670
- You made other plans?
- I didn't make other plans.

100
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:45,028
- I... I didn't know.
- Didn't know what?

101
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:47,162
That you were coming.

102
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:49,869
Why didn't you
tell him I was coming?

103
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,546
He doesn't have a phone.

104
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:53,225
- You don't have a phone?
- I do.

105
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,932
Are you having money problems?
Why don't you buy him a phone?

106
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:58,558
Mom, I'm fine.
I'm not having money problems.

107
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:02,433
I'm... I dropped my phone
while I was solving

108
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:04,634
a very important crime.
It was on the front page

109
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:06,856
of the newspaper yesterday. Yeah.

110
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:10,262
May I speak with you privately?

111
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:20,664
What the hell is going on in there?
I tried to tell you.

112
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,518
Allow me to demonstrate trying.

113
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,824
"Shawn guess who's coming back
into the country on friday.

114
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,380
Your mother."
That's it... mission accomplished.

115
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:28,177
Look, I wanted to clear
the air on a few things

116
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:29,882
- before she got here.
- Clear the air?

117
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:31,752
You think you can undo 15 years
of hard feelings

118
00:05:31,753 --> 00:05:34,239
- with a bottle of pinot...
- Bordeaux.

119
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,136
I didn't even know wal-mart
had a wine cellar.

120
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,413
Look, would you give me a break.

121
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:39,846
I'm just trying to make
a nice night for her here.

122
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:42,152
You're sabotaging me.

123
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:44,143
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know.

124
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:45,649
But I'm gonna figure it out.

125
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:54,593
You wanted to see me, mr. Ogletree?

126
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,779
Shut the door, burton.

127
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,677
I... was reading the paper...

128
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:02,001
Yesterday...

129
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:05,040
And something caught my attention.

130
00:06:06,343 --> 00:06:09,563
Have to say I was surprised,
considering you seem

131
00:06:09,564 --> 00:06:12,220
to already have a full-time job.

132
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,147
This is... just...

133
00:06:16,148 --> 00:06:19,498
Something I do on the side.
A hobby, really, like...

134
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:22,624
Collecting thimbles
or, raising carrier pigeons.

135
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:26,175
- You raise carrier pigeons?
- No, not at all. That's totally lame.

136
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:28,253
I just said that
because I was flustered.

137
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:30,742
I raise carrier pigeons.

138
00:06:30,864 --> 00:06:32,736
I'm glad you said that.

139
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:35,006
Because I was afraid
to tell you how cool

140
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,920
I thought carrier pigeons are.

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,650
Flying around and...
Carrying stuff.

142
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:41,247
Coming back.

143
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:42,899
Awesome.

144
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,616
I hear that.

145
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:48,245
Are you familiar with the
exclusivity clause in your contract?

146
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:51,665
It means we
don't allow second jobs.

147
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,100
Jobs?

148
00:06:55,594 --> 00:06:58,488
No, no. Psych is more like
community service.

149
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:01,094
- And it never affects my work.
- Well...

150
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:04,616
this photo
was taken thursday night.

151
00:07:04,617 --> 00:07:07,216
I notice that you
signed out early that day.

152
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:09,144
I think the important thing
is I signed out.

153
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:11,213
Let's roll back
the clock, shall we?

154
00:07:11,257 --> 00:07:13,074
Monday, the 28th.

155
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:14,944
You had three appointments.
You missed all of them.

156
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:18,201
Tuesday, the 29th,
you disappeared after lunch.

157
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,459
And, wednesday, well, here you are.

158
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,302
You did your entire week's work
in one afternoon.

159
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:26,239
- It was a crazy week.
- Seems to me you had a crazy year.

160
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:30,352
I have taken the liberty
of preparing this for you.

161
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:34,056
What is this?

162
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:36,065
It's a termination notice.

163
00:07:36,378 --> 00:07:40,260
Or... you could quit
your other job.

164
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,241
You tell me.

165
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,680
Good choice!

166
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:58,596
Psych 301
"Ghosts"

167
00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:13,916
Synchro : Flolo

168
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:16,212
For SeriesSub.com

169
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,063
you don't have to walk me
through the whole building.

170
00:08:24,064 --> 00:08:26,426
I used to do
quite a few sessions here.

171
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:29,407
- This is where I met your father.
- I know. I heard the story.

172
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,571
He did his evaluation
after he shot some drug dealer.

173
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:34,098
He told you that?

174
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:37,818
He twisted his ankle doing security
for the cinnamon festival.

175
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:39,838
I had to clear him for duty.

176
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:41,860
Figures.

177
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:43,728
That's about par.

178
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:45,625
What happened?

179
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:47,950
He said the two of you
were getting along better.

180
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:50,890
Mom, the last thing I wanna do
right now is talk about henry.

181
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:54,166
Okay, that's fair.
Let's talk about you.

182
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:56,723
Who is that date you had
to cancel on friday?

183
00:08:56,724 --> 00:08:58,316
It was just some girl I met.

184
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:01,770
She's a... museum curator.
It's not a big deal, mom.

185
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:03,420
I doubt it would have
worked out anyway.

186
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,414
- How many dates?
- That would have been the first.

187
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,656
- mom.
- Come on, goose.

188
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:09,885
Whenever we talk,
you're always about

189
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:12,110
to not go on a second date
with somebody new.

190
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:14,477
I happen to be excellent
at first dates.

191
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:16,209
You know who is
having multiple dates?

192
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:17,814
Dad. I believe he's up to number eight

193
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:20,397
with his jekyll-and-hyde
english girlfriend.

194
00:09:20,398 --> 00:09:22,227
You guys should connect more often.

195
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:24,599
He told me they broke it off
a few weeks ago.

196
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:28,425
- We're talking about him again.
- Yes, we are. Let's stop. I should let you go.

197
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:31,303
How many of these
do you have to do, anyway?

198
00:09:31,348 --> 00:09:33,624
Three uniforms and a detective.

199
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:38,207
- you wanna see me, chief?
- yes.

200
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,855
It has come to my attention,
detective,

201
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:43,821
that you've discharged your weapons
in the last four cases you've worked.

202
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:46,804
- Thank you.
- That wasn't a compliment.

203
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:48,679
I'm just trying to keep
the streets safe, chief.

204
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,969
The last incident
was at a cat show.

205
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,621
Well, let me just
go on record as saying

206
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:55,910
that I would never shoot a cat.

207
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:58,511
I guess I could find
some solace in that.

208
00:09:58,512 --> 00:10:00,756
Unless it was approaching
in a threatening manner.

209
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:02,391
Or refused to stop upon my command.

210
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:04,471
I would probably just fire
a warning shot

211
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:06,768
to make my point,
but it's really a field decision.

212
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,792
I can't commit to it
at this juncture.

213
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:12,290
I've requested
a department-sanctioned

214
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,363
psychologist
to come here and have...

215
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,331
A session or two with you.

216
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:19,785
I'm just... Gonna have to say no.

217
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:21,577
That wasn't a question.

218
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,551
Could you phrase it like one?

219
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,067
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same question.

220
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:40,310
I work here.

221
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:42,289
I should ask you
a different question.

222
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,106
Why didn't you return
my calls all weekend?

223
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:46,274
I had no other choice
about all of this.

224
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,747
Oh, my god. This isn't a joke.

225
00:10:48,836 --> 00:10:51,364
- You're really quitting psych?
- I'm so sorry.

226
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,771
In a text message, no less?

227
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:54,563
I couldn't think
of any other way to tell you.

228
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:56,740
I knew you would just try
to convince me to stay.

229
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:59,031
Listen, maybe we could
still do it on the weekends.

230
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:00,514
If you're ready
to hear some good news,

231
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:02,878
I have worked out a compromise
that will solve all of this.

232
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,745
- Really?
- Yes. You quit this job. This job you quit!

233
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:08,047
We take on extra cases
to make up the difference in salary.

234
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:09,783
I make 48 grand a year.

235
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:11,461
What is that, yen?

236
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:13,381
Who needs $48,000 to live?

237
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,136
I need 32.The other 16
generally goes to you.

238
00:11:16,137 --> 00:11:18,714
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I claimed you on my taxes.

239
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:22,794
Holy crap. Is this bianca's
pappardelle?

240
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,449
I found it in the kitchen fridge.

241
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,017
Oh, my gosh, she's gonna go insane.

242
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,200
She hand rolls her pasta
every weekend.

243
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:31,055
They take all day. She grinds her
own spices.

244
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,750
Well, I thought
it was for everybody. Crap!

245
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:39,665
- Paul would like to see you.
- Mr. Haversham?

246
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,642
Really? Lovely.
I'll be there in a second.

247
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:49,903
What does she do?

248
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,992
She's haversham's secretary.

249
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:53,287
Is haversham the guy
who tried to fire you?

250
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:56,372
No, he's that guy's boss.
Everybody's boss. He's the vp.

251
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:59,416
Perfect he's the one we have to convince
to let you keep doing both jobs.

252
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,824
I need a second. I'm gonna
clean my teeth before we go in.

253
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:04,120
No, no, no, shawn.
You're leaving now.

254
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:07,496
Gus, I'm not budging
until we make this nice.

255
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:10,604
All right. But you asked for it.

256
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:14,315
- Asked for what?
- Let go of me.

257
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:19,491
Don't you dare go boneless on me!

258
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:21,298
Okay, my ba...

259
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:22,862
You see, that's why it's not...

260
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:24,433
you son of a bitch!

261
00:12:37,218 --> 00:12:38,776
You wanted to see me?

262
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:42,184
Yes, I did. I have a project for you.
Have a seat.

263
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:45,776
- Is that your wife?
- It's my grandmother.

264
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:47,314
Tell her I said she's lovely.

265
00:12:47,315 --> 00:12:49,974
- She died.
- I'm going to sit down now.

266
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:53,118
Lots of talk about this
in the office.

267
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:56,384
Yes, sir, i'm aware of that,
and I've already taken care of it.

268
00:12:56,385 --> 00:12:59,215
I don't think you have.
When my wife and I moved

269
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:02,858
into our house, we were met with
a series of unexplained disturbances.

270
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:05,423
Perhaps fueled by my wife's
predilection for the supernatural.

271
00:13:05,424 --> 00:13:06,764
Well, after a while, it stopped.

272
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,974
But recently,
these occurrences have returned,

273
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:11,968
to the point where my wife
is staying with her mother.

274
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:14,259
Mr. Haversham,
why are you telling me this?

275
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,980
Because I believe my wife believes
our house is haunted.

276
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:18,796
And I would like to hire you.

277
00:13:22,737 --> 00:13:25,845
I... Had a strange feeling
I was needed.

278
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:34,725
Looks like word getting out
about you moonlighting

279
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:36,748
- isn't the worst thing in the world.
- Let's be clear:

280
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,283
haversham is the most
powerful man in this office.

281
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:41,475
He's gonna be running
this company sometime soon.

282
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:43,925
- Give the man the respect he deserves.
- What is this?

283
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:47,132
- His company bio.
- Learn it. "Bred for success."

284
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:50,263
His father is william haversham,
genius entrepreneur.

285
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:52,361
This guy grew up under the tutelage

286
00:13:52,362 --> 00:13:54,274
of a business master
and real estate magnate.

287
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:57,117
I know him. He's the one that built
the poliodome.

288
00:13:57,187 --> 00:13:58,643
Polodome.

289
00:13:58,762 --> 00:14:00,341
That's a much less depressing name.

290
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,074
- Shouldn't we go?
- No.

291
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:04,085
Meet me at haversham's at 7:00.

292
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:06,697
- Think I can handle that.
- And no whimpering, no screaming,

293
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:10,113
no running from anything. I don't
care how spooky his old house is.

294
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:13,138
Haversham thinks my nickname
is fearless guster.

295
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:20,018
Well, do you want to start
some sort of recording device?

296
00:14:20,181 --> 00:14:23,321
No, I don't record
my sessions. I prefer just to talk.

297
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,494
How do you remember
the important things?

298
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:27,442
You've heard of
a photographic memory?

299
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:31,565
Well, I have a bit of, I guess you'd
call it an eidetic tonal memory.

300
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:33,486
So you'll remember
everything I've said.

301
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:36,505
Pretty much, yes.
Would you like to start?

302
00:14:36,506 --> 00:14:38,619
Yes. First question:
where's the bug?

303
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,478
- The what?
- The bug.

304
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,917
Nothing new in this area.

305
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:45,801
Must be concealed on your person.

306
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,641
I honestly don't have
anything on me.

307
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:49,625
Then you wouldn't be opposed
to me patting you down.

308
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:50,897
Actually, i'm very opposed to that.

309
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:53,142
Would you be willing to submit
to a polygraph?

310
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:13,741
Don't do this to me. You're late.

311
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:16,143
At this moment,
you are officially late.

312
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:21,936
Just call me when you get here.

313
00:15:58,314 --> 00:15:59,758
Hello?

314
00:16:21,784 --> 00:16:23,369
Is somebody there?

315
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:42,811
I just heard you squeak.

316
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:45,643
Damn you, I thought you
were a ghost from outside.

317
00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:48,175
And yet you still came in,
all by your lonesome.

318
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:51,724
- Fearless guster impresses.
- How did you get inside the house?

319
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:55,193
Hadewych, the housekeeper.
She was leaving, so she let me in.

320
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,028
Tiny little dollop
of a woman. Dutch-indonesian.

321
00:16:58,029 --> 00:16:59,987
Enormous forearms.

322
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:01,820
She made me apannekoek.

323
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:05,684
It's like a pancake,
but it is the size of a manhole cover.

324
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:08,617
- Are you wearing haversham's robe?
- Yeah. You should try it.

325
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:11,416
The worm that spins this silk is
extinct. You can't find these.

326
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,191
- Take it off.
- I can't.

327
00:17:14,362 --> 00:17:16,797
- Hello?
- Where are your clothes?

328
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:18,340
- In the dryer.
- In the dryer?

329
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:21,168
Well, the sauna was a little
bit hotter than I was expecting.

330
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:28,214
- Mr. Haversham, we got here early.
- Hadewych let us in.

331
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,551
We love her, and we'd like
one of our own.

332
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:34,016
- Is that an ascot?
- yes.

333
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,598
Yes, it is.

334
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:37,637
I like it.

335
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,610
It's a classic accoutrement.

336
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:41,721
It's nice to see someone
with a sense of tradition.

337
00:17:41,722 --> 00:17:43,834
Gus and I are both
huge fans of the classics.

338
00:17:43,835 --> 00:17:47,732
To be completely honest, I'm surprised
he isn't wearing his spats this evening.

339
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:50,817
Can we see the epicenter
of the ghoulish activity?

340
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:55,844
Please don't touch anything.

341
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,210
I'm sorry, Mr. Haversham.

342
00:17:58,401 --> 00:18:02,230
But I'm afraid I'm going
to have to touch absolutely everything.

343
00:18:02,906 --> 00:18:05,597
Including this naked lady lamp.

344
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,472
I also might
have to sniff some stuff.

345
00:18:09,473 --> 00:18:11,113
Possibly lick some things.

346
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:13,669
These tootsie roll pops
come to mind.

347
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:18,082
Are you a skeptic, sir?

348
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:22,375
Elaine's the real believer,
so I guess you could say that.

349
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:23,888
Just as I thought.

350
00:18:23,944 --> 00:18:26,021
- Please leave.
- What?

351
00:18:26,924 --> 00:18:29,538
I'm sorry, sir. You are a skeptic.

352
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:33,365
Therefore, you must wait
in the hall preferably at the end.

353
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:35,742
You're killing all of my jubes.

354
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:42,329
Jubes are candies.

355
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,306
Exactly.

356
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:49,338
You better take off that robe.

357
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:51,338
I will. And I know
what you're trying to do.

358
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,155
What, innocently flip
through a photo album?

359
00:18:53,156 --> 00:18:55,602
No, you're sabotaging this
on purpose.

360
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,569
Why would I do that?

361
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,921
To get me fired, so I have no other
choice but to go back psych.

362
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:09,448
That's actually an ingenious plan.

363
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,483
But that's not how I play, gus.

364
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:14,074
I play fair. And I roll hard.

365
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,689
I'm gonna find this man's ghost,
and I will rid him of it.

366
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,553
Did haversham have any enemies?

367
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:26,087
Not really. Corporate thinks
he's a magician.

368
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:28,292
He completely revamped
our inventory system.

369
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,994
Really? Whole system,
from "a" to "z"?

370
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,899
Including "m"? All the vowels.

371
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,211
This guy sounds like
a real maverick.

372
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:42,293
Mr. Haversham, allow me to say

373
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,709
this is my most
valuable work experience yet.

374
00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:47,290
Allow me to say
that I'm not impressed.

375
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,397
Duly noted.

376
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,917
Magnum...

377
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:54,642
Quiet, boy!

378
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:57,511
Stop that!

379
00:19:57,934 --> 00:19:59,273
Quiet, boy!

380
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:04,259
I dont know. What is he barking at?

381
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,871
Come on, boy. Come on.
Come on, that's it. Here we go.

382
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:12,360
Dude... look at you.

383
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,332
You were cool as a cucumber
while that went down.

384
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:18,600
Fearless guster's a badass.
Let's check the basement.

385
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,705
- I can't.
- Why not?

386
00:20:20,706 --> 00:20:22,349
My feet won't move.

387
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,872
So how did it go?

388
00:20:28,957 --> 00:20:30,761
- I'm winning.
- How are you winning?

389
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,760
I answered every question
in character as tom "gunny" highway.

390
00:20:33,761 --> 00:20:36,058
Who is tom "gunny" highway?

391
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:38,133
Clint eastwood's character?

392
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:39,719
In heartbreak ridge?

393
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,155
It's not a contest, carlton.

394
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:44,055
Don't kid yourself, o'hara.

395
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:46,059
You'll only come out losing.

396
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:49,301
Losing what?

397
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:51,807
Why are we going to the basement?

398
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:53,365
Because, gus, that's
where ghosts do their thing.

399
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:56,662
- It's cold and dark and dusty.
- Excuse me.

400
00:20:57,706 --> 00:20:59,592
Can I help you two?

401
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,323
Yeah, we're just gonna
check out the basement.

402
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:03,770
- We don't go to the basement.
- He doesn't go to the basement.

403
00:21:03,771 --> 00:21:06,242
- Why is that?
- Mold spores.

404
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,034
My wife had some workers here.

405
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,059
You can get to the door,
but you can't get in,

406
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,739
- 'cause it's bolted shut.
- Still think it's probably worth...

407
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:19,976
Is that hot chocolate?

408
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:21,425
It's dutch cocoa.

409
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:23,947
Hadewych makes a pot
for me each night before she leaves.

410
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,927
I see. Mr. Haversham, in order
to fully understand

411
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:29,248
the connection that you have
with this ghost,

412
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:31,100
I will need to see what you see.

413
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:32,979
Wear what you wear.

414
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,906
Drink what you drink.

415
00:21:35,704 --> 00:21:37,549
You're saying you'd
like some hot chocolate.

416
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,421
Yes, with marshmallows, please.

417
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:40,594
Right.

418
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:42,849
What?

419
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,514
It's dutch.

420
00:21:48,464 --> 00:21:51,170
Tastes like it was dipped
straight out of willy wonka's river.

421
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:52,810
Would you get serious?

422
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,727
Well, he's not the most
gracious host, you know.

423
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:57,708
If he'd just offered,
I wouldn't have had to ask.

424
00:21:57,709 --> 00:22:01,453
And that pannekoek, not nearly as
filling as it may have seemed.

425
00:22:04,676 --> 00:22:06,755
You're getting hot chocolate
on the floor!

426
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:16,899
Did you see that?

427
00:22:23,334 --> 00:22:25,398
What the hell is...

428
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:34,580
Magnum! Down, boy!

429
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:37,870
That dog is kind of an a-hole.

430
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:40,075
- It sees something.
- Yeah.

431
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:42,611
Urine stains on my pants.

432
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:44,941
So what do we do now?

433
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:47,303
I think we stay here.

434
00:22:47,304 --> 00:22:49,892
We close the blinds,
we lock the doors, we call it a night.

435
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:51,688
Del taco? Del taco.

436
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:53,628
No... not me.

437
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:55,716
- I'm going out there.
- Are you kidding me?

438
00:22:55,717 --> 00:22:57,946
Shawn, this is what we do.

439
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:02,339
Yeah, but there's
a ghost out there...

440
00:23:02,598 --> 00:23:03,924
okay, fine.

441
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:08,600
Do you have high-end,
energy-efficient xenon flashlights?

442
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:20,167
Pardon me for saying so...

443
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:22,039
But fearless guster sucks.

444
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,272
I don't care what you say.
We're solving this case. So suck it up.

445
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:26,767
Suck what up?

446
00:23:26,768 --> 00:23:28,672
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

447
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,253
I don't know.
You got my mind all messed up.

448
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:32,185
- I'm going that direction.
- She went that way.

449
00:23:32,186 --> 00:23:33,849
- Good luck.
- What...

450
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:46,679
Hey, it's me.

451
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:49,002
Not letting you do this alone.

452
00:23:49,164 --> 00:23:51,623
Where's... There.

453
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,030
I got her!

454
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:00,955
What do you mean you got her?

455
00:24:08,622 --> 00:24:10,357
What is going on here?

456
00:24:11,444 --> 00:24:13,467
I don't know.

457
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,550
I realized something.

458
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:23,150
Yesterday, with all that talk
about weapons,

459
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:26,282
I neglected to ask you
a very important question.

460
00:24:26,283 --> 00:24:28,356
What kind of gun do you carry?

461
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:33,534
- Would you like to see it?
- I would love to.

462
00:24:34,996 --> 00:24:37,158
Picked this up
with a little extra cash

463
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,425
after I decided not to go
with a divorce attorney.

464
00:24:39,426 --> 00:24:41,369
You're going through a separation?

465
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:42,852
Well, yeah.

466
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:44,722
Yeah, it's...

467
00:24:44,888 --> 00:24:47,854
She went with one of these
high-powered ambulance chasers,

468
00:24:47,939 --> 00:24:50,920
but, that's just her...
Insecurities, you know.

469
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:53,193
You know who you remind me of?

470
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,751
Who?

471
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:57,221
Did you ever see that movie
heartbreak ridge?

472
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:07,101
Mold spores, shawn.

473
00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:09,947
Well, I'm attracted
to places I'm not allowed to go.

474
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:11,562
Good luck
with your stachybotrous virus.

475
00:25:11,563 --> 00:25:13,802
Listen, man, we need
to wrap this up quickly.

476
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,315
I have dinner plans
with my mom tonight.

477
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:17,253
I've hardly had a chance
to see her at all.

478
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:18,578
What?

479
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:19,965
Hadewych!

480
00:25:20,455 --> 00:25:22,354
It's okay, I'm...

481
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:23,906
I'm shawn spencer. It's me,

482
00:25:23,907 --> 00:25:26,615
and my partner,
lemongrass gogoloab.

483
00:25:26,616 --> 00:25:29,200
Have you noticed anything strange?

484
00:25:29,213 --> 00:25:30,566
Only now.

485
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:32,795
We saw a woman
in the woods last night...

486
00:25:33,752 --> 00:25:35,859
That may not have been alive.

487
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,208
Saturday, the missus...

488
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,721
She leave. Go to mother's, yes?

489
00:25:45,722 --> 00:25:48,118
Sunday, I forget my bag,

490
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:50,217
come back, I hear voices.

491
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:53,153
- Lady voices in the house.
- What did you do?

492
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:56,065
I leave... too much
strangeness here lately.

493
00:25:56,465 --> 00:25:58,993
Something's off
with that woman, shawn.

494
00:26:06,114 --> 00:26:08,274
Okay, nothing's happening.
I gotta go.

495
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,351
- What?
- Gus, we made plans.

496
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:12,747
My dad has been
manipulating her time all week.

497
00:26:12,748 --> 00:26:14,220
Let me be clear.

498
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:16,182
I'm not leaving here
until haversham not only

499
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:18,013
wants me to keep moonlighting
at psych forever,

500
00:26:18,014 --> 00:26:20,739
- but also makes me a partner.
- Sorry, buddy.

501
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,022
What... Wait, what's this?
Are you leaving?

502
00:26:23,023 --> 00:26:24,983
Mr. Haversham, it is my belief

503
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,389
that we have done
all there is to do here tonight.

504
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,897
Tomorrow, we will look
into the history of the house,

505
00:26:33,898 --> 00:26:36,041
see if there's anything
there that can help us.

506
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:40,556
Just don't have
any leads at this point.

507
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:46,697
So! I think we should all
pat each other on the backs

508
00:26:46,698 --> 00:26:48,986
for a job well done so far.

509
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:52,315
Reconvene first thing in the morning
for a nice farmer's breakfast.

510
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:03,087
I have dinner plans with my mother.

511
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:07,826
Oh, you made it.

512
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,604
I was sure
you weren't gonna make it.

513
00:27:09,605 --> 00:27:11,081
I'm sorry, ma.

514
00:27:11,082 --> 00:27:13,227
You have no idea
the day I just had.

515
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:15,441
Well, I'm just running
to the ladies. We're right over there.

516
00:27:15,442 --> 00:27:16,277
We?

517
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:18,568
Your father was lonely,
and I thought I might

518
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:21,138
have to eat dinner alone,
so I let him tag along.

519
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,827
That's fine, right?

520
00:27:22,828 --> 00:27:25,228
You're absolutely certain
he's my father?

521
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:37,868
Grab a menu. We already ordered.
I'm sure it's all right.

522
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:39,647
- All right, what is this?
- What is what?

523
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,369
This. What is all of this?

524
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,832
The aftershave, the pumiced scalp.

525
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,811
- The suit.
- I can wear a suit.

526
00:27:45,812 --> 00:27:48,012
Which one of the three tenors
did you borrow that from?

527
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:50,587
- Not the dead one, I hope.
- It's my suit, shawn.

528
00:27:50,588 --> 00:27:52,559
I dress up occasionally.
You have a problem with that?

529
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,646
No, I have a problem
with this pretend henry

530
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:58,054
that showed up
when mom got to town.

531
00:27:58,055 --> 00:27:59,623
I don't know
where you're going with this.

532
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:01,168
You're acting like a phony.

533
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:03,143
And you know it, and it's
bugging the hell out of me.

534
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:05,428
- Look at yourself.
- Shawn, I order a braised quail salad,

535
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:07,245
and all of a sudden,
you think I'm putting on airs?

536
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:10,594
Excuse me, who here has the guinea hen
crostone with the liver pancetta?

537
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,104
That would be me.

538
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:16,139
Everybody here is ordering it.

539
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:18,367
Look, I'm...

540
00:28:18,487 --> 00:28:21,503
I'm just gonna make this easier
for both of us, okay?

541
00:28:21,504 --> 00:28:23,406
I know exactly what you're up to,

542
00:28:23,407 --> 00:28:26,127
- and I'm not gonna let it happen.
- Let what happen, shawn?

543
00:28:26,128 --> 00:28:28,406
Yeah, if you don't mind
my saying so,

544
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,159
you've been a real jerk
to me all week.

545
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,714
I'm sorry I didn't tell you that your
mother was coming back into town.

546
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:36,484
I'm sorry you think that I
messed up your whole youth.

547
00:28:36,485 --> 00:28:38,810
I'm sorry you think
that I screwed up your life.

548
00:28:38,908 --> 00:28:40,821
Get over it.

549
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:47,442
You had your chance.

550
00:28:47,443 --> 00:28:49,408
Now leave her alone.

551
00:29:03,146 --> 00:29:06,235
Did you know that ogletree
raises carrier pigeons?

552
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:11,200
Hello.

553
00:29:12,758 --> 00:29:13,988
Hello?

554
00:29:16,242 --> 00:29:17,950
That's strange.

555
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:19,356
Who called?

556
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:21,619
Me.

557
00:29:21,796 --> 00:29:23,402
You?

558
00:29:26,105 --> 00:29:28,756
There it is again.
That's my number.

559
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:31,603
- From work?
- No... from here.

560
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:35,541
The call is coming
from inside the house?

561
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:42,594
Put it on speaker.

562
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:49,204
Hello?

563
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,128
Who is this?

564
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,566
Does this number have
any other extensions?

565
00:29:57,616 --> 00:29:58,613
No.

566
00:29:58,655 --> 00:30:01,279
Just... well, there's one,
but it's not plugged in.

567
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,137
Where is it? I'll go check it out.

568
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:05,119
Up in the attic.

569
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,761
The attic?

570
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:11,514
I'll... stay on the line.

571
00:30:12,171 --> 00:30:15,287
You... good luck.

572
00:31:37,993 --> 00:31:40,166
Come on, don't be mad.

573
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,168
You haunted my boss's house?

574
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:45,380
It was the only way to show him
how important and need you are.

575
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:46,999
Look how brave you've been.

576
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:50,113
If we're being honest, I think this has been
a real confidence booster for you, buddy.

577
00:31:50,114 --> 00:31:52,004
Plus, once you solve
the case, you're a hero.

578
00:31:52,005 --> 00:31:53,692
He never bothers you again.

579
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,896
Maybe you'll get a numbered
space in the green lot.

580
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:58,056
Shawn, stop it. How did you even...

581
00:31:59,693 --> 00:32:03,124
Friday, after you quit
our business,

582
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:07,217
I went to your office in hopes of haunting
your regional sales manager. Ogletree.

583
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,003
Unfortunately,
he doesn't believe in ghosts.

584
00:32:10,004 --> 00:32:11,944
So I had to go
a little higher on the rung.

585
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,296
Luckily for me,
katie from accounts receivable

586
00:32:14,297 --> 00:32:17,139
gave me a little tip
about haversham's wife.

587
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,452
Finally got to use my air conditioner
and heating guy disguise.

588
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:23,059
I had an ultrasonic beeper
in my pocket for the dog.

589
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,219
I actually thought you
caught that one for a second.

590
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,138
And, dude, hear me.

591
00:32:28,127 --> 00:32:31,475
Don't ever, ever
put dry ice in your mouth.

592
00:32:31,487 --> 00:32:32,964
It doesn't matter
how well you wrap it up.

593
00:32:32,965 --> 00:32:35,341
- Okay, what about the old woman?
- Young woman.

594
00:32:35,342 --> 00:32:37,924
She does shakespeare
in the parking lot.

595
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:40,323
Down at the albertson's
by la cumbre plaza.

596
00:32:40,388 --> 00:32:42,388
She was all stoked
to finally have a paying gig.

597
00:32:42,414 --> 00:32:45,393
And ditching the dress in the woods,
well, that was just an improv.

598
00:32:45,394 --> 00:32:48,998
Because who knew fearless guster
would come after her, you badass.

599
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:51,541
The rest of it
was pretty simple, really.

600
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:54,753
I even visited alice bundy
in prison to get a few pointers.

601
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:56,944
- How do we solve it?
- Solve what?

602
00:32:56,945 --> 00:32:59,746
The ghost. How do we solve a case
where you're the culprit?

603
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:02,164
That is a very good question.
I hadn't thought that far ahead.

604
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:05,393
- You haven't thought that far ahead?
- Well, give me a second.

605
00:33:06,032 --> 00:33:08,943
I'm hiding under the towel.

606
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:14,316
And then I realize
the towel's my life.

607
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:18,468
And... and the pool is third grade,

608
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:22,281
and the high dive is my father.

609
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,373
I poured out to you secrets
even I didn't know I had.

610
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:42,626
That was... amazing.
I mean, it's so...

611
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:44,981
Liberating to...

612
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:48,784
To trust someone
with your darkest innermost secrets.

613
00:33:48,785 --> 00:33:51,056
Where have you been?
Why haven't you been here before?

614
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:54,002
I used to be here quite a bit.
I just recently came back.

615
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:57,195
I know someone here who works
for the department occasionally.

616
00:33:57,196 --> 00:33:59,058
Actually, he's my son.

617
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:00,461
Really?

618
00:34:00,534 --> 00:34:02,151
You know, I know pretty much

619
00:34:02,152 --> 00:34:04,531
everybody who comes through
the department. What's his name?

620
00:34:09,093 --> 00:34:12,558
- Ghost... gone.
- Just like that?

621
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,630
Just like that. It's split, it's history.

622
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:17,381
Will not be bothering you again.
And that is a guarantee.

623
00:34:17,382 --> 00:34:20,600
 100%.
- How can you... guarantee.

624
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,713
Please don't ask. Just enjoy.

625
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:24,810
And now, regarding our fee...

626
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:26,919
Of course, there will be no charge.

627
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,840
Knowing that you appreciate the work
that gus does for the community.

628
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:32,152
And for the company.
It's more than enough reward.

629
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,086
But if you were to insist
on some sort

630
00:34:34,087 --> 00:34:37,790
of expense reimbursement,
we, of course, would not accept.

631
00:34:37,893 --> 00:34:39,455
Please, have a seat.

632
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:44,600
I have a bit
of the sixth sense myself, mr. Guster.

633
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:46,964
Helps me out when a business deal's
about to go south.

634
00:34:47,015 --> 00:34:48,923
And it's bothering me right now.

635
00:34:48,924 --> 00:34:52,729
I don't understand
this... guarantee. And I don't like it.

636
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,572
Last night, when that call came in,
guster, you went upstairs.

637
00:34:56,573 --> 00:34:57,828
At the end of that call,

638
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,479
I heard something
that made me question all of this.

639
00:35:01,303 --> 00:35:03,408
- What was it?
- It was the voice.

640
00:35:03,415 --> 00:35:06,097
- Something was wrong with it.
- What was wrong with it?

641
00:35:06,098 --> 00:35:08,843
It said... "gus."

642
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,028
Just like that.

643
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,301
Well, sir...

644
00:35:16,854 --> 00:35:19,724
I'm pretty sure that
that can be easily explained.

645
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,543
Yes, I'm sure that it can.

646
00:35:22,544 --> 00:35:25,380
But there's something I really need
for you to do for me right now.

647
00:35:25,482 --> 00:35:26,718
Yes?

648
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:29,396
Leave!

649
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,267
And, Mr. Guster,
I will carefully ponder

650
00:35:32,268 --> 00:35:35,548
my next move and your future
with the company.

651
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:39,204
Let's talk, burton.

652
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:48,023
Well, thank you for your time,
mr. Haversham.

653
00:35:48,216 --> 00:35:51,250
I'm... sorry you don't believe me.
But I do understand.

654
00:36:01,103 --> 00:36:03,030
Can we speak privately?

655
00:36:03,947 --> 00:36:05,697
Just one second.

656
00:36:07,906 --> 00:36:09,491
What's your game?

657
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:14,005
I have two games.
Red rover and lawn darts.

658
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,905
We'd need at least four
for even the most

659
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:18,685
rudimentary game of rover, and they
don't make lawn darts anymore.

660
00:36:18,686 --> 00:36:20,987
Too dangerous.
But that's not why I'm here.

661
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:24,427
I sensed several things
in that house that...

662
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:27,732
I couldn't tell you
with other people in the room.

663
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:29,820
This is getting desperate,
mr. Spencer.

664
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:32,048
But, please, wow me.

665
00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:34,397
You weren't raised by your father.

666
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,625
You were raised
by your grandmother.

667
00:36:40,485 --> 00:36:42,180
It was her ring.

668
00:36:42,538 --> 00:36:46,351
Her ring that your wife wears now.

669
00:36:48,068 --> 00:36:51,211
Perhaps my father
wasn't as present as I'd hoped,

670
00:36:51,212 --> 00:36:54,058
and, yes, my wife
wears my grandmother's ring.

671
00:36:54,204 --> 00:36:56,814
- That doesn't mean anything.
- Maybe not to you.

672
00:36:56,986 --> 00:37:00,621
But the sanctity of marriage
means a lot to your grandmother,

673
00:37:00,622 --> 00:37:02,817
and having an affair with, what...

674
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:04,633
A secretary?

675
00:37:04,634 --> 00:37:06,859
That just feels wrong.

676
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,751
No matter how good
her pappardelle is.

677
00:37:08,752 --> 00:37:10,387
And just what the hell
are you accusing me of?

678
00:37:10,388 --> 00:37:12,465
You're getting hot chocolate
on the floor!

679
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,951
Is this bianca's pappardelle?

680
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:18,466
I hear voices.
Lady voices in the house.

681
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:20,254
No accusations here.

682
00:37:20,255 --> 00:37:23,054
I'm just telling you, your grandmother
is very disappointed in you.

683
00:37:23,055 --> 00:37:24,930
And she doesn't want you
to go to jail.

684
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:27,760
Well, nothing you've
accused me of is illegal.

685
00:37:28,236 --> 00:37:30,846
He completely revamped
our inventory system.

686
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:37,059
Repackaging samples and reselling them,
while lucrative, is highly illegal.

687
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,832
So what is this now?

688
00:37:39,905 --> 00:37:42,293
- A shakedown?
- No, there's no shakedown.

689
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:45,202
I'm just telling you what I know.

690
00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:49,829
I'm a psychic, and with great power
comes great responsibility.

691
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,795
And that responsibility
I share with gus.

692
00:37:52,796 --> 00:37:56,794
All we want is the opportunity
to continue doing our work.

693
00:37:58,632 --> 00:38:00,245
Just between us?

694
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:02,407
I'm a psychic.

695
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:03,908
I can't lie.

696
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:10,777
Mr. Guster, back to work.

697
00:38:10,778 --> 00:38:14,913
As per our conversation, your raise
will be reflected in your next check.

698
00:38:15,784 --> 00:38:17,970
I'm sorry, i'm confused.

699
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,962
Spend a little more time
on your own business, frankjim.

700
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:23,664
Excuse me.

701
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,716
I know about you too.

702
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,134
His hair is horrible.

703
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:42,270
- She who bore me.
- What are you doing here, goose?

704
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:44,156
I finished working on my case.

705
00:38:44,185 --> 00:38:46,232
And I had this amazing idea
that I would come by,

706
00:38:46,265 --> 00:38:49,746
and scoop you up, and take you to
a movie, and it would just be us.

707
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,338
Actually, your dad
was planning on coming by.

708
00:38:52,984 --> 00:38:54,417
Of course he was.

709
00:38:55,204 --> 00:38:58,908
- Okay, I'll go.
- Wait... enough.

710
00:38:59,161 --> 00:39:01,006
- What happened?
- When?

711
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,414
Between you two.

712
00:39:02,975 --> 00:39:06,829
Mom, that is a veritable
lifetime of conversations.

713
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,842
- Follow me.
- No, mom. Mo... come on.

714
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,228
Sit!

715
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:17,230
- Are we really gonna do this?
- Sit down!

716
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:20,078
What happened? Don't mince words.

717
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,049
With dad? Mom, we were both there.

718
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,359
You know. We don't need
to revisit the past.

719
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,536
Maybe we do.

720
00:39:26,537 --> 00:39:29,173
Well, I'm not sure I wanna forgive him
for what happened.

721
00:39:29,174 --> 00:39:31,476
- The divorce?
- It wasn't what happened, mom.

722
00:39:31,477 --> 00:39:33,964
It was the way that it happened.

723
00:39:33,965 --> 00:39:37,498
I mean, let's call it what it was.

724
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:39,639
He left us.

725
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:41,926
He left you.

726
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:47,945
He ended up with the house, and he left
you by yourself to pick up the pieces!

727
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:53,292
That's not exactly what
I call hero material, you know?

728
00:39:56,385 --> 00:39:57,902
I left him.

729
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,876
Come on, mom, you don't...

730
00:40:01,877 --> 00:40:03,811
You don't have to spin this
for me, okay?

731
00:40:03,812 --> 00:40:05,383
Let me be clear.

732
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:08,356
Your father was wonderful to me.

733
00:40:08,357 --> 00:40:10,044
He wanted to keep
going to counseling.

734
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:12,449
He kept saying we could make it, but

735
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,663
the writing
was on the wall a long time.

736
00:40:15,634 --> 00:40:17,957
You're losing me here, mom.
What are you...

737
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:24,819
When I got that job out of town,
it was an incredible opportunity.

738
00:40:24,994 --> 00:40:28,697
I was afraid I would
never have a chance again, so I took it.

739
00:40:29,214 --> 00:40:31,219
You were into your senior year.

740
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,180
Your... your path was set.

741
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:36,382
It seemed the right time,
if such a thing is possible.

742
00:40:37,942 --> 00:40:40,853
I thought, of all people,
that you would be okay.

743
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:44,310
And I am so sorry.

744
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:50,305
Mom, you don't ever...
You don't ever have to be sorry.

745
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:53,435
- About anything.
- Don't you spin this.

746
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:56,452
Sometimes I get
the worst realizations.

747
00:40:58,143 --> 00:40:59,647
I know...

748
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:03,591
I know...

749
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,625
That I failed you.

750
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:09,514
But... i think...

751
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:13,201
That day, my life began again.

752
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:18,123
And that sounds terrible, but don't
you ever think I wanted to leave you.

753
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:29,210
