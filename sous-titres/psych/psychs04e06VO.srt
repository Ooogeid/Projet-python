1
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:14,138
Special girl, huh?

2
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:17,391
Yeah, kind of.

3
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:19,464
It's nice to see you
applying yourself.

4
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:21,478
It looks like you put
a lot of work into that.

5
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:23,813
Thanks, dad,
but I don't know if I'm gonna send it.

6
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:25,051
Why?

7
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:26,233
Why, Shawn?

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,027
- There are obstacles.
- Obstacles?

9
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:30,569
All couples have obstacles.
The key to it is,

10
00:00:30,694 --> 00:00:33,282
you're never gonna know
unless you put yourself out there.

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,786
- Gus says it'll never work.
- What does Gus know? Gus is 12.

12
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,464
You remember at that skate party

13
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:40,998
how he cried
when that girl touched his arm?

14
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,166
Come on.

15
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:44,807
- What do you think?
- Let's see.

16
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:47,463
The heart is good.
You tell her that she's pretty,

17
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,123
but not in an creepy,
aggressive kind of way. I like that.

18
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:53,104
Down here, I think what you wanna do is,
I think you wanna...

19
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:55,554
tell her that you'd like
to call her sometime.

20
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,123
Do that.

21
00:00:57,675 --> 00:00:59,873
It looks like you forgot
to address it there.

22
00:00:59,998 --> 00:01:02,404
You want to write
her name big and pretty,

23
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,272
make her think she's important.
You know how sometimes I write

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,060
and I do the calligraphy
with big loops and swooping letters?

25
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:09,683
Do that, do that up there.

26
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:12,361
Dad,

27
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:13,786
could you do it?

28
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:15,938
Yeah, sure, I guess.

29
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,287
All right, what's her name?

30
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:23,003
Mrs. Phillips.

31
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:55,656
What's wrong?

32
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:59,410
I hate having to hide what we have.
You know, we can't really...

33
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:03,096
be together until you tell her.

34
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:05,012
I will.

35
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,083
Soon.

36
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:09,821
Mina?

37
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,590
You're back on in two minutes.

38
00:02:18,024 --> 00:02:19,574
- I'll go.
- No.

39
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,515
I don't want to disturb your ritual.

40
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,342
It's bad luck.

41
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,800
This is my "I told you so" room,

42
00:02:51,925 --> 00:02:54,153
where I like to gloat
after a completely wild accusation

43
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:56,886
turns out to be spot on.
That's my "oops" corner,

44
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,906
where I apologize to people
for being arrested

45
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:01,776
after a completely wild accusation
turns out to be just that.

46
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:03,652
Over there is where you get gum.

47
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:05,601
- Free, by the way.
- What?

48
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,428
- This is...
- I know you.

49
00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:11,440
I met you
at our high-school reunion.

50
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:13,573
Yes, you did.

51
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,403
- Shawn tells me you're a teacher.
- Yeah, kindergarten.

52
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,467
That's great.
I think that's great.

53
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:21,408
I mean, kids... they're so great.
That must be really fun.

54
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,343
You know,
I loved my kindergarten teacher.

55
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:27,414
Before I went into law enforcement,
I actually considered teach...

56
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,832
This is detective Carlton Lassiter.

57
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,294
I do his job and sometimes his hair,

58
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,730
though clearly not today.

59
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:35,785
I'm really sorry.
I can't play with you today.

60
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,717
I'm about to go solve another case
and do it in record time.

61
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,596
It is at this point that I must decide
which part of that very bold statement

62
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:46,919
to riff off of. Now, I can hone
in on "another", which implies

63
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:49,382
- that he's solved more than one.
- That's pretty easy, though.

64
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:51,224
Or I crack down on "record time"

65
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:53,982
and the positive, for him,
record time is, like, 2 and half years.

66
00:03:54,163 --> 00:03:56,037
- Good, not great.
- You drive a hard bargain.

67
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:58,404
- You love it.
- I know. Why don't you go home

68
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,613
and wait for me

69
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,081
not to call you?

70
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,288
He's just saying that so
that it'll be more dramatic later on

71
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:07,266
- when he has to ask for my help.
- More dramatic for who?

72
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:09,252
I don't know.

73
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:10,875
That guy, I guess.

74
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,460
All right,

75
00:04:17,585 --> 00:04:19,603
so what exactly is this information

76
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,844
about the accident
behind the theater earlier?

77
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:23,596
This was no accident.

78
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:24,983
Really?

79
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:27,045
Well, that's helpful.

80
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,170
And you...

81
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:29,934
You know the victim?

82
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,798
Victims, plural.

83
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,146
Mina wasn't the only one.

84
00:04:33,965 --> 00:04:36,065
Fortunately, she is the only one
who didn't get hurt.

85
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:38,819
Sir, you are exactly
what I needed today.

86
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:42,835
We're gonna have to do this quick
while his girlfriend is still waiting.

87
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,325
Whose girlfriend?

88
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:47,854
Never you mind. I'm thinking out loud.
Don't want to interrupt your flow.

89
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:49,226
I like what you're saying,

90
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:51,659
so let's just go straight
to the million-dollar question:

91
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:53,374
who exactly is responsible?

92
00:04:55,302 --> 00:04:56,179
I am.

93
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:58,964
I hurt them all.
I'm a danger to everyone around me.

94
00:05:01,178 --> 00:05:02,630
All right, Mr. Singh,

95
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:04,367
this is how it's gonna work.

96
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:07,025
See, sometimes there are
these bleeding-heart activist judges

97
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,642
who won't take a detective's iron-clad
word for it when he gets

98
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,947
a perfectly uncoerced confession.

99
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:14,654
So just so we're clear,

100
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:16,440
I'd like you
to write everything down.

101
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,572
When you did it,
where you did it, why you did it.

102
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:20,736
Now, the why is very important.

103
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,030
- You're done?
- Yes.

104
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:25,311
You just wrote, like, three words.

105
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:33,937
Would you excuse me?

106
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,138
I'll just be a minute.

107
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,061
This place was actually built
by the Amish,

108
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:44,927
which explains the complete
and utter lack of zippers.

109
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,013
I was too harsh.

110
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:50,135
- When?
- Just now.

111
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:51,989
Perhaps always.

112
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,190
The truth is,
the guy in the interrogation room "A"

113
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:57,515
is a solid lead,
and I just don't have the...

114
00:05:58,052 --> 00:06:00,609
- You know, to follow through.
- What exactly are you trying to say?

115
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,487
I'm saying I need your help.

116
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,590
All right,
but only if Abigail can watch.

117
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,284
I'll put a chair
in the viewing room.

118
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:11,412
Perfect.

119
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:12,891
Thanks, buddy.

120
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,171
This should be interesting.

121
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:34,201
First, I want to tell you that...

122
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,352
I love you.

123
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:40,107
Secondly...

124
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:42,525
What can I do for you...?

125
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:43,610
Raj.

126
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:46,613
- Can I call you Roger?
- First name's Rajesh.

127
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:48,611
I'll stick with Roger.

128
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:51,615
I'm going to tell you what I do.

129
00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:53,871
I don't want you to freak out
because it's so cool.

130
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:57,711
I'm a psychic,

131
00:06:57,836 --> 00:07:00,057
a great and powerful psychic

132
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:03,338
whose powers inspire fear and awe
in those who first experience them.

133
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,792
I am a crime-solving machine,

134
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:10,005
<i>and I have closed over 50 cases,</i>

135
00:07:10,318 --> 00:07:11,363
<i>many without pants.</i>

136
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,975
Finally,
someone who will understand me.

137
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:18,395
You can talk to me.
I am your friend.

138
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:21,660
I hurt people,
lots of people,

139
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:24,902
lots of innocent people.

140
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:31,075
It's funny, 'cause you don't...
really strike me as a violent guy.

141
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:34,286
How could you commit these crimes?

142
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:37,289
I can't help it.
The attacks, they just happen.

143
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:39,341
I see.

144
00:07:40,515 --> 00:07:41,464
And...

145
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:42,762
what, you use...

146
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:44,213
some sort of weapon?

147
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,291
I am the weapon.

148
00:07:49,316 --> 00:07:50,052
Really?

149
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,938
And it's immediate.
Even I can't predict it.

150
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,145
I can just be alone

151
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,601
in a room with somebody.

152
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,353
Got it.

153
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,615
In that case, Raj,

154
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:04,900
I think all that's left here,

155
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:07,027
<i>question-wise, is...</i>

156
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
"why?"

157
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,573
I mean, why, why,
why do you hurt these people?

158
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,117
Why have I hurt these people?

159
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:16,620
You got to see this.
Wait for it. Here it comes.

160
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,281
<i>It's because I...</i>

161
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:22,126
It's because I'm...
It's because I'm cursed.

162
00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:26,255
<i>Yes, I win.</i>

163
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:27,538
Finally!

164
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:29,491
Finally I put one over on him.

165
00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:31,113
This is...

166
00:08:31,703 --> 00:08:33,887
This is completely satisfying.

167
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:41,603
You're a psychic.
You must believe me.

168
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,689
You must be able to help me.

169
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,980
Can you?

170
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:46,755
Yes, I can, Roger.

171
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,770
I will break your curse,

172
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,447
and I will solve this case,
mostly...

173
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:57,217
Because the detective
who was in here earlier...

174
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:58,537
cannot.

175
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,302
This is so good.

00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:03,143
- Where are the bunnies?
- What?

179
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:06,313
You said someone left a dozen bunnies,
and you didn't know how to feed them.

180
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:09,233
I made that up.
I just needed you here, man.

181
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,069
- This is about a case, isn't it?
- What do you think?

182
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,655
I should have known, when you said
they were falling asleep in your hand.

183
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:19,076
Look, I was humiliated by Lassiter,
Carlton Lassiter.

184
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:21,954
A challenge has been issued,
I need every tool we've got.

185
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,540
- Are you calling me a tool?
- I'm calling you my partner.

186
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,209
My logic brain,
my magic wish machine.

187
00:10:27,723 --> 00:10:28,710
What have we got?

188
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:34,669
My name is Raj.
I have a curse.

189
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:38,356
I don't do curses. You know that.

190
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:40,668
- Gus, come on.
- That mummy almost sucked my eyes out.

191
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:42,382
- It wasn't a mummy.
- Yes, it was.

192
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:44,768
It was a snobby guy
and an effeminate dude in a wheelchair.

193
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:46,307
Apples and oranges.

194
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,220
This is a love curse.

195
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:50,656
This poor guy thinks
there's some kind of hex

196
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:52,645
on all the girls
he tries to hook up with.

197
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,946
We investigate, find some evidence,
convince him he's not cursed

198
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,609
so that he can live a full
and happy life with his lady love.

199
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:00,784
Man, this is a matter of the heart.

200
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,922
- He's paying us, right?
- Yeah, cash.

201
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:13,254
The last four women that I've dated
have all had terrible accidents.

202
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:15,331
And with each girl,
it gets worse and worse.

203
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:18,257
The first one had a car accident.
Another's apartment burned down.

204
00:11:18,382 --> 00:11:20,320
What do you do
after these things happen?

205
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:22,876
I break up with them.
I have tried to be alone,

206
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,480
believe me, I have,

207
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:26,935
but then I met Mina,
and my heart couldn't help itself.

208
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:29,446
I keep thinking
that the next time will be different,

209
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:33,575
but every woman that I fall in love with
is targeted by forces I can't fight.

210
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:36,331
Do you have any enemies
in this world?

211
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:37,700
I'm a nice guy.

212
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:39,734
I don't know why anybody
would want to curse me.

213
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:41,388
You are a nice guy, Roger.

214
00:11:41,513 --> 00:11:44,450
And I presume you could teach us both
a thing or two about cricket.

215
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:48,050
But let's not jump to conclusions.
Show me where this accident occurred.

216
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,328
It was just inappropriate, Carlton,
with his girlfriend standing there.

217
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:56,515
When has anything he's ever done to me
been appropriate?

218
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,636
Having his girlfriend there was just
a gift from god for all my good deeds.

219
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:02,929
Speak of the devil.

220
00:12:04,101 --> 00:12:07,933
I want you to know that I am not gonna
gloat about what happened yesterday.

221
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,896
Yesterday, why? What happened?
What day is this?

222
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,063
The truck ended up striking
the dumpster, fortunately,

223
00:12:14,188 --> 00:12:16,360
which pinned the girl
between the grill and the wall,

224
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,087
but left her enough room
to escape without serious injury.

225
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,368
We talked to the driver, who swears
that he put blocks under the tires

226
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,410
to prevent the truck from rolling down
the alley, which is on an incline.

227
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:28,272
- So it is a case?
- I checked out the driver.

228
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:31,458
He's been written up twice for failing
to take basic safety precautions.

229
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:33,543
- So it's not a case?
- We don't know yet.

230
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,523
The brakes haven't been checked
in 15 years.

231
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:37,130
It looks like an accident.

232
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,467
- Like your hair.
- Really? Down to hair jokes now?

233
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,599
That is so sweet.
Look how much he cares for her.

234
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:51,973
He's really taking
this accident pretty hard.

235
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:58,468
My brother Jay is a choreographer,
he's been trying to get this playhouse

236
00:12:58,593 --> 00:13:01,321
to put on a bollywood-style show
for years. There he is.

237
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,730
Come on, now.
Five, six, seven, eight.

238
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:08,284
Mina said she was coming in
to rehearsals today.

239
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:11,393
I'm just gonna go check on her,
make sure she's okay after the accident.

240
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,533
- You don't think Lassiter may be right?
- Gus, please.

241
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:18,933
Don't be Harry Potter
and the prisoner of marzipan.

242
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:20,618
- Azkaban.
- I've read it both ways.

243
00:13:20,743 --> 00:13:23,363
- No, you haven't.
- Of course I don't think he's right,

244
00:13:23,488 --> 00:13:26,816
but it's not looking too good
for Raj's whole curse idea either.

245
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,403
How many of you have seen
<i>All That Jazz</i>?

246
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:33,603
No? <i>White nights</i>?

247
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:35,313
Gregory Hines, Baryshnikov?

248
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:39,504
That explains everything.
We're gonna redo the whole routine.

249
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:41,676
Go wait in my dressing room.
Go, go, go.

250
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,242
Lakshmi,

251
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,856
she's Mina's understudy.

252
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:49,911
Excellent.

253
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,286
Yes, she is.

254
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:55,750
So it's safe to assume
that you don't believe in this curse?

255
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,081
Everything that goes wrong in his life,
he blames on the curse.

256
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,806
I mean, it's a crutch.

257
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:03,469
Don't get me wrong,
I love him like a brother.

258
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:05,051
He is your brother.

259
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:06,887
Yeah, by blood,

260
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:09,672
but he doesn't live in the same world
as the rest of us.

261
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:12,219
He lives in a world of magic
and goblins,

262
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,856
and what he needs to do
is step into reality, okay?

263
00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:17,348
Up!

264
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:19,719
Talk some sense into him.

265
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:22,728
I'm getting married in a month, I would
love to have a reasonable person

266
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:24,236
as my best man.

267
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:25,697
He believes in you, psychic,

268
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:28,116
for better or for worse.

269
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,203
That butterfly was right.

270
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:35,052
Raj is a guy that just needs
to get out of his own head.

271
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:36,957
Everything bad that happens to him,

272
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:39,413
he interprets as some sort
of divine intervention.

273
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:40,969
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

274
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:42,784
How do we break him out
of the pattern?

275
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:44,596
Apparently he believes in me,

276
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:48,136
so I will lift his curse,
and you will be my special helper.

277
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,669
Cursed girlfriend-ruiner,

278
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:54,076
be gone.

279
00:14:54,557 --> 00:14:55,999
This seems dangerous.

280
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:58,619
You're not letting the curse
leave your body.

281
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:00,716
- He's right. You could electrocute him.
- Really?

282
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:02,722
- His hand is in water.
- You tell me that now.

283
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,905
You saw what I was doing us
at that bowl.

284
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:08,835
Repeat after me.

285
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,912
"I am not cursed.

286
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:14,328
- "It's all in my head."
- But it's not all in my head.

287
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,922
You have to say it in order
to believe it. Let me do the rest.

288
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,476
- Who is the professional here?
- You?

289
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:21,467
Close your eyes.

290
00:15:23,351 --> 00:15:24,651
I am not cursed.

291
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,478
It's all in my head.

292
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,790
- I'm feeling it.
- Really?

293
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,972
Get me the hedge clippers.

294
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,933
I guess I am feeling something.
It's tingling.

295
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,317
That's the electrical breaker
shorting out.

296
00:15:37,442 --> 00:15:39,103
- What?
- It's shorting out.

297
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:40,728
His hand's in water.

298
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:44,234
Are you here? Give me a hand,
I got some groceries here.

299
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,617
- Hallelujah, the curse is broken.
- What?

300
00:15:46,742 --> 00:15:47,961
All gone. Get your coat.

301
00:15:48,086 --> 00:15:49,322
- Broken?
- All broken.

302
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,156
Let's get out
efore it finds you again.

303
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:53,181
All gone. You're curse-free.

304
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,834
What the hell?
Smoke in my living room?

305
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,284
Dad, it's not smoke.
It's just a little dry ice, okay?

306
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:07,173
We're helping a client by freeing him
of the feelings that he might be cursed.

307
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,051
The guy that's got the girlfriends
that keep dropping like flies?

308
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,704
One girl that we know of for sure.

309
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:15,181
She almost got crushed by a runaway
truck, but she's fine, relatively.

310
00:16:15,462 --> 00:16:17,210
- Did you talk to her?
- I didn't need to.

311
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:19,060
She's not gonna crush herself.

312
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:22,020
Smart-ass.
All right, just clean up this crap.

313
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:23,145
Ten-four.

314
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:24,834
That's me,

315
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:26,812
cleaning machine.

316
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:46,504
You seem different.

317
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:56,153
What?

318
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:58,757
Aren't you gonna introduce me
to your...

319
00:16:58,882 --> 00:16:59,915
whoever they are?

320
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,993
That's Shawn and Greg.

321
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:04,314
And they helped me out

322
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,816
with a problem earlier,
and I owe them.

323
00:17:07,657 --> 00:17:08,943
Can you hook my friends up

324
00:17:09,398 --> 00:17:11,946
with two tickets
for tonight's performance?

325
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:35,645
Standing room,
back of the theater...

326
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,722
- Some reward.
- Come on, Greg.

327
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,568
Let's just congratulate each other
on a job well done

328
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:43,436
and enjoy this explosion of culture.

329
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,901
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

330
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:52,790
Just celebrating another successful
conclusion to a case.

331
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:54,163
- In record time.
- What?

332
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:55,288
Really?

333
00:17:56,915 --> 00:17:59,690
Then you know that the brake lines
on the truck were severed?

334
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:01,579
Look, Lassie,
that truck was very old.

335
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,082
Parts can snap at any time.

336
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,875
You also know, the safety blocks

337
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,086
that should have been
under the tires were found

338
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,295
in the dumpster.

339
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:12,455
Maybe we should have done
some actual investigating.

340
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,426
- You think?
- What are you two talking about?

341
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:15,385
Nothing.

342
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:18,680
I just might need to go up there.

343
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:21,234
No, Shawn, you do not go up
under any circumstances.

344
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,643
- I think we made a huge mistake.
- I don't care.

345
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:27,564
- Shawn, stop it!
- Let go!

346
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,484
Don't go boneless on me...
My back!

347
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,217
I got you.

348
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:06,478
I told you it was a curse.

349
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,478
Did you notice anything suspicious
around the stage today?

350
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:19,463
And you can't think of anyone
that's been threatening you?

351
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:20,588
No one.

352
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:23,166
Don't you worry, miss.
I'm gonna find the person who did this.

353
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,856
I'm done. You can take her.

354
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,291
Raj, will you meet me
at the hospital?

355
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,765
No, I can't.

356
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:33,768
- I have to go.
- Go where? I need you.

357
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:36,716
This is all my fault.

358
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:38,908
I am so sorry...

359
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,494
For everything.

360
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,298
Raj, come back!

361
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:49,548
They're taking Mina for x-rays.

362
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:51,689
Some uniforms stay with her,
then take her home.

363
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:54,569
We should send a unit
to secure her residence as well.

364
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,029
This ladder is really built for one.

365
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,116
Jules, lots of things say
they're built for one,

366
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,175
but can easily fit two people.

367
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,801
Tanning beds, iron lung...
That's just to name two.

368
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,439
Why are you still here? II thought
you solved this case hours ago.

369
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:18,766
- Lassiter's really got your goat, huh?
- Yeah, he does, and I want it back.

370
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:20,885
God knows what he's doing
to that poor thing.

371
00:20:21,113 --> 00:20:24,722
You don't really believe
in love curses, do you?

372
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,419
Jules, I'm a psychic.

373
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,893
I have to remain open
to any number of...

374
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:31,187
Why, do you?

375
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,843
Well, I think that everybody
who's looking for a soul mate

376
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:37,379
may, at one time, feel
that there are outside forces

377
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,320
conspiring against them, but...

378
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:43,992
Shawn, what are you doing?

379
00:20:45,897 --> 00:20:47,149
It wasn't a curse...

380
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:49,694
Not this time.

381
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:51,614
Plastic.

382
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:53,877
That wasn't gonna
hold Mina for long.

383
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:57,005
Snapped in two
and painted to look like metal.

384
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,438
This means we're looking
for a real flesh and blood human being

385
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:02,566
or a genetically enhanced monkey.

386
00:21:02,691 --> 00:21:04,554
Either way, someone wanted
to hurt this girl.

387
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:07,015
I'll have forensics see
what they can get off of these.

388
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:08,808
- This doesn't make sense.
- Why?

389
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:11,923
Because there were, like,
15 backup dancers up here, right?

390
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:14,827
I mean, how would the perpetrator
know that this trapdoor would give way

391
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:17,525
at the precise moment
that Mina danced across it?

392
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:24,235
What are we doing here?
I thought we were going to a movie.

393
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,416
Yes, movie, later.

394
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,571
But first, Gus and I need to knock
off some quick case business.

395
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,549
You!

396
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,914
He must've mistaken us
for someone else.

397
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,175
Go away, Shawn!

398
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:48,431
I wonder how many Shawns he knows.
I should double-check.

399
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,529
You are a fraud!

400
00:21:53,857 --> 00:21:56,796
Dude, if you don't let us in,
we're gonna break through your window.

401
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:58,173
We need to talk to you.

402
00:21:58,298 --> 00:22:00,734
We got to figure out
who could've wanted to hurt Mina.

403
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:01,777
Fine.

404
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,050
It's okay.

405
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:04,085
Fine.

406
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,700
Curse breaker?
You ridicule me?

407
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,369
My hand in a bowl of water?
You could've gotten Mina killed.

408
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:13,998
The reason the ceremony didn't work,
Raj, is because you are not cursed.

409
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:17,669
- It was sabotage, and I know this.
- And how can you be so sure?

410
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:21,673
Because I happen to travel in these
sort of metaphysical arenas, dude.

411
00:22:22,103 --> 00:22:25,123
As sure as I am that Gus will
accidentally cause his own death...

412
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,986
I know that you are not cursed.

413
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:29,681
Now, we need to talk to you and Mina.
Is she here or what?

414
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,849
Who's out there?

415
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:33,672
Come on.

416
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,214
Wonderful.

417
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:40,024
More mouths to feed.

418
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:42,151
Thank you for the advance notice.

419
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:43,945
No, we didn't come to eat.

420
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:50,297
You know, guys, my grandmother tends
to make her food a little spicy.

421
00:22:50,422 --> 00:22:53,740
- You might want to take it easy.
- Please. I'm one-quarter Jamaican.

422
00:22:54,113 --> 00:22:56,172
- I'm also one-quarter Jamaican.
- You are not!

423
00:22:56,297 --> 00:22:57,874
Stop telling people that!

424
00:23:05,298 --> 00:23:06,884
So how do you know my grandson Jay?

425
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:09,887
We're actually friends of Raj.

426
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,265
You're not here for Jay
and Sita's engagement dinner?

427
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,673
We're helping Raj with a problem.

428
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:18,312
I'm sorry, was this chicken
seasoned with molten lava?

429
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,275
Sorry about that... Wedding stuff.

430
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,234
Hi, I'm Sita.

431
00:23:24,742 --> 00:23:25,451
Hi.

432
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,063
Did you get the mango leaves?

433
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:29,824
They're not in season.

434
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:32,735
How can we have a wedding
without mango leaves?

435
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,078
Very inauspicious.

436
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,749
We could push the wedding date,
if it means that much to you.

437
00:23:38,526 --> 00:23:41,310
Again? How many times
are we gonna do this?

438
00:23:42,358 --> 00:23:43,502
Until it's right.

439
00:23:43,737 --> 00:23:45,840
But I already booked
Kajagoogoo for the party.

440
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,967
What do you mean, like a cover band?

441
00:23:48,524 --> 00:23:49,533
Come on, kid.

442
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,764
Don't worry. It's gonna be great.
It'll be beautiful.

443
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,503
This wedding business
is more trouble than it's worth.

444
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:57,685
Better than being alone forever.

445
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Really?

446
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:00,172
You're just fine?

447
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:02,548
I taught English to children
in Mumbai for a month.

448
00:24:02,673 --> 00:24:04,105
This is very authentic.

449
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,360
What's the matter, Shawn,
you don't like it?

450
00:24:06,485 --> 00:24:09,530
- I think I like it too much.
- It's so authentic.

451
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,984
I can't see anything
out of my left eye.

452
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:13,633
I see dead people.

453
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:19,540
- My god, even the water's spicy.
- Who does that?

454
00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:33,156
What are you watching?

455
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:35,544
Footage from the night
that Mina was almost killed.

456
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:37,725
On the right screen is
a performance from a week ago.

457
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:41,562
Why you watching this? We were there.
Went over the stage with a comb.

458
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,186
Just something that Shawn said
at the crime scene.

459
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:46,463
Wait.

460
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:50,488
Do you see what I see?

461
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,038
Looks like I better get a warrant.

462
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,497
All right.
I'm sorry, no offense,

463
00:25:03,622 --> 00:25:06,629
but it's stupid
that you people eat food this hot.

464
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,829
I said "no offense," right?

465
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,765
You should marry her.

466
00:25:18,295 --> 00:25:19,037
Dadi.

467
00:25:19,162 --> 00:25:21,932
She's not on tonight's menu, sorry.

468
00:25:22,483 --> 00:25:25,533
She's so much better
than your other lady friends.

469
00:25:25,668 --> 00:25:27,733
There were some real gems
amongst those.

470
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:30,194
Dadi, those were
all very nice people.

471
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,989
And you found all of the things
that you said were stolen.

472
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,230
More uninvited guests.

473
00:25:37,355 --> 00:25:38,555
Thank you all very much.

474
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,746
I'll just go to my garden
and harvest some food.

475
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:43,254
Okay, I will get that.

476
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:51,418
Spencer, excellent.

477
00:25:51,543 --> 00:25:54,093
I'm so glad that you're here
to see me close your case.

478
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:56,390
Would you like a little insight
into our process?

479
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:59,693
You see, first we start by asking
a few simple questions.

480
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:01,934
Jay, would you mind telling me

481
00:26:02,486 --> 00:26:04,027
who has changed the choreography

482
00:26:04,152 --> 00:26:06,448
so that only Mina danced
over the trapdoor?

483
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:08,941
Of course, I changed the choreography,
but I had no idea...

484
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,652
And who originally
wanted Mina's understudy for the role?

485
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,606
Well, I originally recommended Lakshmi,
but then I grew to appreciate Mina,

486
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:16,490
especially after
she and Raj started...

487
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,792
You have to stop him.

488
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,203
Sorry, I don't think
it'll be possible.

489
00:26:20,483 --> 00:26:23,090
You see, my partner's already
searching his apartment as we speak,

490
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,474
and guess what she already found?

491
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,714
Turns out Jay's the one that rented

492
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:30,004
and had access to the truck
that almost killed Mina.

493
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,434
Jawaharlal Singh, stand up,
put your hands behind your back.

494
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,260
You're under arrest
for attempted murder.

495
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,951
- Stand up.
- What?

496
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,990
Let's go, tough guy.

497
00:26:41,356 --> 00:26:43,043
Lassie, you can't do this.

498
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,810
You're way, way off base.

499
00:26:44,981 --> 00:26:46,262
What are you talking about?

500
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:48,669
You're the one who gave us
the choreography lead.

501
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:50,480
Thank you for that, by the way.

502
00:26:54,222 --> 00:26:55,821
Come on, come on!

503
00:26:56,276 --> 00:26:59,154
But we're supposed to get
married in a month.

504
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,292
You're destroying my family.

505
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:09,622
So you came here to help Raj.

506
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:12,358
But instead you got his brother
arrested for attempted murder.

507
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:13,560
That's correct.

508
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:15,129
Business as usual?

509
00:27:15,564 --> 00:27:17,042
It's a process.

510
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,605
I'm sure it's just
a misunderstanding.

511
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,536
Don't cry.
We'll sort it out.

512
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,814
- Here's the good news.
- You see what you've done?

513
00:27:30,236 --> 00:27:33,693
You ridiculed my curse and my beliefs,
and now it's affecting everyone I love.

514
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:35,711
First it was Mina, then my brother,

515
00:27:35,836 --> 00:27:38,061
and now Sita,
who's like a sister to me.

516
00:27:38,277 --> 00:27:39,864
Look, Raj, I can fix this.

517
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:43,375
The case against Jay is pretty strong.
They have motive, means, opportunity.

518
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,298
The only thing they don't have is
a video of him committing the crime.

519
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,526
Maybe you can find that
for the cops too, Shawn.

520
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:50,376
Leave us all alone.
You've done enough.

521
00:27:51,565 --> 00:27:52,670
Stop it, Raj.

522
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,088
Just stop.

523
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:57,049
There is no curse.
Someone is doing this to you.

524
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:58,148
Really?

525
00:27:58,273 --> 00:28:00,553
Then how do you explain
what happened to Gita, Raini,

526
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,054
Dipti, and Victoria, huh?

527
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:04,223
- He's like a puma.
- We need to get out of here.

528
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,710
- How'd he get up so fast?
- I don't know.

529
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:09,735
- I blinked, and he was right there.
- He's probably right.

530
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,709
We should talk to Gila,
Ray Jay, and Dipstick.

531
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:15,067
You know those names
were nowhere near close, right?

532
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,236
It all started
with the break-in at my condo.

533
00:28:19,024 --> 00:28:20,454
And then a car accident.

534
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,075
Next thing I knew,
my apartment was on fire.

535
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:26,579
We talked about moving in
together, right before it ended.

536
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:30,248
I met his family on Friday,
and by the next weekend, it was over.

537
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,329
He seemed really sad to call it off.

538
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,274
Right when things were best,
I thought he was the one.

539
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:38,711
I had that accident.

540
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:40,551
Then he said
we couldn't be together.

541
00:28:40,842 --> 00:28:43,147
Are you as jealous
of this guy as I am?

542
00:28:43,272 --> 00:28:44,272
More...

543
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,487
Except for the parts
where his girlfriends almost die.

544
00:28:53,841 --> 00:28:55,941
They're releasing my brother,
no thanks to you.

545
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,774
Actually, all thanks to me.

546
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:01,447
I'm the one that lined up his alibi
with the timeline of the crime.

547
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,199
I'm the one that found two witnesses

548
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,525
that put him someplace else
when the sabotage occurred.

549
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,204
And I am the one that got him
arrested in the first place.

550
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:10,748
That last one didn't play.

551
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:13,209
Just scratch the last one, okay?

552
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:15,397
We spoke to your other girlfriends.

553
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:17,671
And we have concluded
that they were all kind of hot.

554
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,688
That's true.

555
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,399
But more importantly,
there's a pattern here.

556
00:29:21,524 --> 00:29:23,274
This person,
whoever's out to get you,

557
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,471
only strikes when you get
serious with someone.

558
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,145
- I don't understand.
- It means it's someone you know.

559
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,851
Or knows you, and they only attack
when you've committed to someone.

560
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,646
I've devised a plan
to draw out the attacker.

561
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:36,357
We just need Mina...
I need to stop you right there.

562
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,317
Mina's gone.

563
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:39,581
What?

564
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:42,662
- You didn't kill her, did you?
- Gus, please, some decorum.

565
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:46,235
- You didn't, right?
- No! I put her on a plane.

566
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,910
I broke it off with her.

567
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:50,334
Maybe I was just meant to be alone.

568
00:29:51,604 --> 00:29:54,456
You would rather lose her than see
the possibility of harm come to her.

569
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:56,148
You love her that much?

570
00:29:56,273 --> 00:29:58,610
- I don't know any other way to love.
- Really?

571
00:29:58,858 --> 00:30:00,398
Have you seen <i>9 1/2 weeks</i>?

572
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:02,716
Or any of Zalman King's other stuff?

573
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:06,822
- What's the plan?
- It's not important now.

574
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:10,099
We were going to dangle Mina out
to lure the killer to attack.

575
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:13,579
You were gonna make the woman I love,
the woman I would give my life for...

576
00:30:13,704 --> 00:30:17,154
- You were gonna make her bait?
- Bait? That's a strong...

577
00:30:17,581 --> 00:30:18,889
fishing term.

578
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:21,819
We were gonna make her an incentive,

579
00:30:22,216 --> 00:30:25,781
since the attacker's only pattern
is to keep you from finding love.

580
00:30:27,257 --> 00:30:28,492
I have an idea.

581
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:35,958
Man,

582
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,586
I don't like this.

583
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:42,088
- You don't like Julia dating somebody.
- Fake dating.

584
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:43,613
But that's not it.

585
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:46,799
It's this whole
"using her as bait" thing.

586
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,263
You had no problem
dangling his girlfriend as bait.

587
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,783
Now you're changing the rules,
aren't you?

588
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:53,006
Look at Raj.

589
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:55,978
He's getting
awfully "handsy" over there,

590
00:30:56,697 --> 00:30:59,176
taking advantage
of the situation like that.

591
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:02,501
<i>No, he's definitely bugged
by O'Hara dating this guy.</i>

592
00:31:06,258 --> 00:31:08,308
Don't leave the talk button on.

593
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,554
That was so good.

594
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:16,785
I've never had broccoli
in a milkshake before.

595
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,450
But just think
how good it is for you.

596
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:20,961
Well, well, well.

597
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:22,784
It's 11:20.

598
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:25,257
Look who finally decided
to come home.

599
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:26,776
I'm sorry, Shawn.

600
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,222
- Are you upset about something?
- As a matter of fact, I am...

601
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,453
What did I do?

602
00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:35,549
I didn't like this idea to begin with.
You've been on four dates now.

603
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:37,520
It's been
a complete and total failure.

604
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,647
No, Shawn,
we've been on three dates.

605
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,650
No, there was the carnival,
where Raj won you a big, fat octopus.

606
00:31:43,129 --> 00:31:46,320
There was a long walk on the pier,
where he kept brushing your hair gently.

607
00:31:46,795 --> 00:31:49,498
Then there was dinner tonight,
where there was a lot of hand-holding.

608
00:31:49,623 --> 00:31:51,582
Who could forget coffee
at the police department,

609
00:31:51,707 --> 00:31:54,945
where you blushed and squealed
and giggled like a schoolgirl?

610
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,022

He was there to sign some papers.

611
00:31:57,147 --> 00:31:59,870
- You were watching us?
- It's called surveillance.

612
00:31:59,995 --> 00:32:01,413
I "surveillate" things.

613
00:32:01,538 --> 00:32:03,212
I'm a purveyor of "surveillerism."

614
00:32:03,857 --> 00:32:06,171
Let's not get caught up in wordplay.
The point is,

615
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:09,927
we've been at this charade for 3 weeks,
and it's yielded a grand total of <i>nada</i>.

616
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,888
- You're right.
- Of course I am. You see that?

617
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:16,684
It's clear that the killer doesn't think
detective O'Hara is my girlfriend,

618
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:19,027
or maybe they know
I'm still in love with Mina.

619
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:21,935
We can keep at this for six months,
we're still not gonna get anywhere.

620
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,815
Unless we did something
to remove all doubt, something big.

621
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,446
You said it yourself,
it happens when Raj gets serious.

622
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,364
Right.

623
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:34,333
Your entire family's going
to the Holi Festival this weekend?

624
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,920
I have another idea.

625
00:32:39,603 --> 00:32:41,208
You want to get married?

626
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:56,563
This is so considerate of you.

627
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:59,468
I always wanted to go to the Festival
when I was in India.

628
00:32:59,593 --> 00:33:00,796
Yes, I sensed that.

629
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:03,225
I'm aware
of your immense love for...

630
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,450
traditional festivals of colors.

631
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,527
There also might be a killer here,
and I may need you to block an exit.

632
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:09,506
What?

633
00:33:10,315 --> 00:33:11,615
Fresh laddu.

634
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:16,660
There's Mrs. Singh.

635
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:20,247
She hates me, and people don't hate me.
I get cards from people I arrest.

636
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:22,166
She doesn't hate you, okay?

637
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:26,284
Apparently I don't fit the picture
of what her perfect Raj deserves.

638
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:29,965
I am smart, and I am fun,
and I am almost always in a good mood.

639
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,301
You're not actually marrying Raj,
remember?

640
00:33:33,072 --> 00:33:35,929
- Let's just get this show on the road.
- Please.

641
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:39,817
Hello, everybody.

642
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:43,520
I see that a lot of my family
are here today, and...

643
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,564
I wanted to share
some great news with you.

644
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:48,859
As many of you know,
I've had some trying times lately.

645
00:33:49,182 --> 00:33:51,582
I lost a love
that I thought was true

646
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:54,907
and... had some trouble
within my family.

647
00:33:55,462 --> 00:33:56,962
But this woman here,

648
00:33:57,608 --> 00:34:00,704
this beautiful angel
has been my savior.

649
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,274
And I know that a lot of you
will think it's crazy, and...

650
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,211
it may be impulsive, but...

651
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:09,922
I've asked my beautiful Juliet
to marry me,

652
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:13,801
and she accepted.

653
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,808
All right.
Looks like people bought it.

654
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:23,746
Now we just have to wait.

655
00:34:24,297 --> 00:34:25,297
And watch.

656
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,259
Is it too early for a snack?

657
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:33,237
We've been here five minutes.

658
00:34:35,127 --> 00:34:38,015
All right, I admit it.
I was wrong about the brother.

659
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,619
- We should call a truce.
- That's awfully big of you.

660
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:44,289
Detective,
might I have a word with you?

661
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,860
What can I do fo...

662
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:48,627
Wait a minute.
You're the guy from the theater, right?

663
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,004
I didn't tell you everything
the day you questioned me.

664
00:34:52,108 --> 00:34:54,225
On that night
just before the accident,

665
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,050
I overheard
Mina and the Raj guy talking...

666
00:34:57,948 --> 00:35:00,198
<i>I hate having to hide what we have.</i>

667
00:35:00,676 --> 00:35:03,976
<i>You know we can't really be together
until you tell her.</i>

668
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,117
<i>I will. Soon.</i>

669
00:35:06,877 --> 00:35:08,418
He was seeing someone else.

670
00:35:08,912 --> 00:35:12,151
Mina was going to expose the affair,
giving Raj motive for murder.

671
00:35:12,956 --> 00:35:15,174
He wasn't distraught
because he almost lost his girlfriend.

672
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:17,369
It was guilt
over trying to kill her.

673
00:35:17,494 --> 00:35:19,408
His first confession was real.

674
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:21,672
<i>Who, exactly, is responsible?</i>

675
00:35:21,797 --> 00:35:22,529
<i>I am.</i>

676
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:25,414
<i>I hurt them all.
I'm a danger to everyone around me.</i>

677
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,041
I solved it. It was Raj.
Truce over.

678
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,794
- You can't take back a truce.
- You coming with me or not?

679
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:34,131
Raj wouldn't cheat on his taxes,
much less his girlfriend.

680
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,799
I'll take that as a no.

681
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:41,138
Tell him, you can't take back a truce.
Indian giver!

682
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:51,201
I meant to insult
an entirely different group

683
00:35:51,326 --> 00:35:53,233
of Indians.
Sorry about that.

684
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,844
You can't endanger Juliet
over a gripe with Lassiter.

685
00:35:56,969 --> 00:35:59,621
I'm not. You heard the dude
from Temple of Doom.

686
00:35:59,746 --> 00:36:01,463
Raj was hiding his relationship,

687
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:03,749
but from who?
That's who we're looking for.

688
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,893
And Lassiter's following Raj,
who didn't do it.

689
00:36:07,018 --> 00:36:09,268
Then who exactly is watching Jules?

690
00:36:14,629 --> 00:36:15,629
There!

691
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:20,969
What happened?
Where's Juliet?

692
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:24,828
I got hit from behind.
Next thing I knew, she was gone.

693
00:36:24,953 --> 00:36:26,016
Did you see who?

694
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,782
- No, it all happened so fast.
-  Do you want me to call an ambulance?

695
00:36:29,907 --> 00:36:30,813
I'm fine.

696
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,607
Spread out, everybody.
I want eyes on my partner in 5 minutes.

697
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,845
You, take a break.
Have a sweet ball.

698
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:42,414
Excuse me.

699
00:36:57,141 --> 00:36:58,141
There!

700
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,936
It's gonna be okay, Sita.
Just take it easy.

701
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,288
I know what's going on.

702
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:14,064
- You do?
- Of course I do.

703
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,691
Shut up! Don't come any closer.

704
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:18,164
I can see... I can see it all.

705
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:21,113
You met Jay.
He proposed. You accepted.

706
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:23,998
Then you starting
hanging out with the family,

707
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:25,075
mostly Raj.

708
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,387
That's when you realized

709
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,776
you were truly in love with Raj,

710
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,582
not your fiance.

711
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:33,125
But you were stuck.

712
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:35,836
You couldn't call off the engagement,
make a play for Raj.

713
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:39,006
He would never do that to his brother.
So what did you do?

714
00:37:42,898 --> 00:37:44,636
Really, dude? Really?

715
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,333
- Where was I?
- She was stuck.

716
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:49,308
Right. You were stuck,

717
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:52,227
engaged to one man
but in love with his brother.

718
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:54,062
So you decided to take action.

719
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:57,566
First, you did everything you could
to delay your wedding to Jay.

720
00:37:58,703 --> 00:38:01,862
<i>We could push the wedding date,
if it means that much to you.</i>

721
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,365
Then, you sabotaged
all of Raj's relationships,

722
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:07,773
waiting for a time
when both of you were free,

723
00:38:07,898 --> 00:38:09,869
convincing him
that he would be by himself

724
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:13,332
for the rest of time, making it easier
for you to swoop in at the right moment.

725
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:15,004
Poor Mina,

726
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,668
she was the easiest one of all.

727
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,384
Nobody was gonna question
why you were hanging around.

728
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:22,305
After all, you were engaged
to the choreographer.

729
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,176
You swing by, you say, "hi,"

730
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,929
and that's what granted you access
to the crew's trucks.

731
00:38:27,424 --> 00:38:30,349
Probably even had blueprints
and keys to the theater.

732
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,200
You even watched the rehearsal
to see if the dance steps changed.

733
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,330
Get back.

734
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:39,376
I'm gonna kill her.

735
00:38:39,511 --> 00:38:42,059
She can't have what I want,

736
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,801
because he's mine.

737
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:46,448
Me and Raj,
we're meant to be together.

738
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:48,408
Let her go.

739
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,384
Let her go, and all of this
will be much easier for you.

740
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:53,747
You were...

741
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,607
You were crazy in love.

742
00:38:57,469 --> 00:39:00,374
Any fool could see
what would drive you to do this.

743
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,095
Word of advice,

744
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,980
when you take someone hostage,
you might want to check for weapons.

745
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,199
Drop the knife.
Drop it.

746
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,600
- Did Abigail see that?
- I'm here.

747
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:25,948
Yes, you are.
The pain surprised me.

748
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,418
And I wasn't supposed
to get slapped by a girl.

749
00:39:28,543 --> 00:39:29,733
It's a process.

750
00:39:30,444 --> 00:39:31,992
It is a process.

751
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:35,455
- What'd I miss?
- Not me getting slapped.

752
00:39:35,922 --> 00:39:37,833
- By a girl.
- 'Cause that didn't happen.

753
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:41,253
You're caught... Assaulting a cop
and tons of witnesses.

754
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,879
You're not gonna get away.

755
00:39:47,279 --> 00:39:49,179
Have fun with shock therapy.

756
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,195
I got a wedding invitation
from Raj and Mina.

757
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:58,578
It feels good,

758
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:01,663
bringing people together,
watching them sail off into the sunset,

759
00:40:01,788 --> 00:40:04,303
giving a good guy
the old happily-ever-after.

760
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:06,987
I felt for Raj. End of the day,
we had a great deal in common.

761
00:40:07,602 --> 00:40:08,902
You gonna go?

762
00:40:09,027 --> 00:40:10,607
I barely knew that dude.

763
00:40:10,732 --> 00:40:13,076
And this, Abigail,
is where we end our tour,

764
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:14,716
because right here

765
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:18,290
is where I choose not to gloat
when I've gotten the best of Lassie.

766
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,513
Right here?

767
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:21,875
It's more all...

768
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,647
All-overish, I guess.

769
00:40:24,061 --> 00:40:25,422
But I've never done that,

770
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,299
though there's
a 1st time for everything.

771
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,217
Color me impressed.

772
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,470
I'd rather color you
with edible body paints.

773
00:40:31,966 --> 00:40:32,846
Duly noted.

774
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,775
Besides, it's not that impressive.

775
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,476
I solve a case every week
and usually one around christmas.

776
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:39,439
It was so impressive

777
00:40:39,564 --> 00:40:41,980
the way you just attacked
that mad woman with a knife.

778
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,901
It says so much about your character,
about how you feel.

779
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,360
How I feel?

780
00:40:47,593 --> 00:40:50,527
You risked your life
for a random coworker.

781
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,511
She's not random.

782
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:02,894
What I mean is, it's part of the job.
I would do that for anybody...

783
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:04,709
Colleague, coworker,

784
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:07,756
Corey Haim once.
Wouldn't do it again, to be honest.

785
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:10,856
Never got a thank you, and I'm sure
he stole my medic alert bracelet.

786
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:12,919
- You have one of those?
- It's Gus'.

787
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,750
Long story.

788
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:17,307
So am I fingerprinting you or what?
It's fun,

789
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,775
but you'll have little black fingers
for, like, a month.

790
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,856
Three stores have been hit
in 15 minutes.

791
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,651
Units are in pursuit of the suspects.
Let's roll!

792
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,083
Go ahead.

793
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:34,930
I got the last one.
We'll let Lassie have this one.

794
00:41:41,147 --> 00:41:42,958
Want to do a fake mug shot instead?

795
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:45,261
Are you kidding me right now?

796
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,595
We'll need costumes. Where did I put
the key to the evidence locker?

797
00:41:50,225 --> 00:41:51,622
The holding cells.
