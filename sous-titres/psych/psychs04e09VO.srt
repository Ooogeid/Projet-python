1
00:00:02,351 --> 00:00:03,418
I'm sorry, dad.

2
00:00:03,543 --> 00:00:05,826
But since
when did bandanas count as hats?

3
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:08,013
- I was close.
- Close doesn't cut it anymore.

4
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:09,508
You're going soft on me.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,510
You know I'm 11, right?

6
00:00:11,702 --> 00:00:14,327
It's not some bar trick, Shawn.
This is about survival.

7
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:17,183
Knowing how many hats in the room
may very well save your life one day.

8
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:20,636
Now pay attention. Today we're learning
about worst-case scenarios.

9
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:23,499


10
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:29,124
We got down here as soon as we could.
Are you all right?

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,936
You had better have a good reason
for dragging me out of my bed

12
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:34,742
and down here to "Nowheresville"
at 4:30 in the morning.

13
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:36,889
Where the hell's Spencer?

14
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,898
Your guess is as good as mine.

15
00:00:39,023 --> 00:00:40,784
If I wanted to make guesses,

16
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:42,958
I would go on a game show.
What is going on?

17
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:46,190
Look, all I know is he left me
this message about an hour ago.

18
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:48,762
<i>Buddy, I figured it out.
It's sweet.</i>

19
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:51,495
<i>This whole thing was just a rehearsal.
I'm leaving my place.</i>

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,351
<i>Meet me down
at the storage yard now.</i>

21
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:55,825
<i>Come in your fireman PJ's
if you have to. Just be there.</i>

22
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,765
What does that mean, "rehearsal"?

23
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:58,891
I have no idea.

24
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,731
What are you doing here?

25
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:08,508
Here we go.

26
00:01:09,447 --> 00:01:11,779
How do you escape when you're locked
in the trunk of a car?

27
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:15,116
"When"? Don't you mean "if",
as, like, maybe never.

28
00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:16,886
Not today, kid.

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,060
Your survival training

30
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:20,654
starts right now.

31
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:27,753
Don't worry, Ms. Nussbaum. It's fine.
Got the keys right here.

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,867
Just teaching Shawn
a little survival technique.

33
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:32,452
Thank you.

34
00:01:33,888 --> 00:01:35,386
All right, Shawn.
Listen up.

35
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,133
Now here's what you want to do.
You want to feel for the brake light.

36
00:01:38,258 --> 00:01:40,296
You feel it?
It's right over here.

37
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,444
Okay, now what you would do
is you'd kick it out with your feet.

38
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:46,981
You'd want to create a hole
to look out and see where you are.

39
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,527
I didn't say to actually do it.
I said you would do it.

40
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,392
Two, two...

41
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,603
Three, four.

42
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:31,026
Gina, who is it?

43
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,611
- It's Shawn Spencer.
- Who's Shawn Spencer?

44
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:37,281
It's this guy that I went on maybe
two dates with, like, three years ago.

45
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,842
- Pick it up.
- No, it's weird

46
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:42,203
'cos we had a great time, I don't know.
He never called me back, it's awkward.

47
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:48,566
Play hard to get.

48
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:49,691
Watch this.

49
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,560
<i>Shawn Spencer, what do you want?</i>

50
00:02:57,668 --> 00:02:58,768
<i>Gina Repach.</i>

51
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:01,973
Hello.

52
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,983
That's all you have
to say for yourself... "hello"?

53
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:07,037
Why did you never call me back?

54
00:03:07,162 --> 00:03:09,847
Was it because I had two slices
of cheesecake at the cheesecake factory?

55
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,777
<i>'cause if that's it, I have lost a lot
of weight since then. I really have.</i>

56
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:17,401
And I feel so bad about that.
And I want to address it, I do,

57
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:21,242
but you could do me a little favor here.
See, I'm in some trouble, and I need...

58
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,542
A favor?

59
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:25,293
How dare you ask me for a favor
after what you did to me?

60
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:26,705
<i>I'm sorry, but nobody,</i>

61
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,250
nobody treats Gina Repach
that way, FYI.

62
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,541
Wait, don't...

63
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:33,608
It wasn't the cheesecake.
It was...

64
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:36,373
the talking about yourself
in the third person.

65
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,930
Come on, come on.

66
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:00,322
All right.

67
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:07,621
Wait.
This just came in from Shawn.

68
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:08,747
Read it.

69
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:11,613
I have no idea what this means.

70
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:15,302
"Trunk yelrfx ocone pol peac sig."

71
00:04:15,427 --> 00:04:16,577
What is that?

72
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:17,903
It's gibberish.

73
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:23,397
Wait, there's more.

74
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:24,922
"Binshot not lol."

75
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:27,887
- What is he talking about?
- Binshot.

76
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:34,963
What are you playing with
over there?

77
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:39,441
It's blood.

78
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:41,463
Binshot.

79
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,075
Oh, my God.

80
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,440
Shawn's been shot.

81
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,973
Psych 409
"Shawn Takes a Shot in the Dark"

82
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,077
Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

83
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:13,844
Based on the blood patterns
and marks on the ground,

84
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:16,419
he was shot here
and dragged this way.

85
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:17,983
Blood trail ends here.

86
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:20,272
Couldn't get
any useable tread marks,

87
00:05:20,397 --> 00:05:22,846
but these swirls in the gravel
indicate kickback from a car

88
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:24,792
pulling out of here
at a high rate of speed.

89
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:27,993
Recovered a single shell casing.
Shooter used a. 45 auto.

90
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,497
Who the hell called him down here?

91
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:34,622
I did.

92
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,002
- It's his father.
- Which is why I don't want him here.

93
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:38,711
If Shawn really is shot,

94
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,881
they'll be no room for family
in the investigation.

95
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,927
If Shawn has been shot, there's no room
I'm not gonna bust open to find my son.

96
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,847
- You got it?
- Henry, please.

97
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,140
This thing may get personal.
We might need him.

98
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:56,105
If we do this, we do this my way.
No questions.

99
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,890
Spencer will ride with me.
We'll chase the breadcrumbs to find him.

100
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:01,652
You take Gus
to retrace Shawn's steps

101
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,113
in whatever ridiculous investigation
he got himself into.

102
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,407
We got a lot of ground to cover.
Let's go.

103
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,135
Move out!

104
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:17,263
Think hard.

105
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:19,336
What brought Shawn down here?

106
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:25,998
All I know is this whole thing
started a few days ago,

107
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:27,884
with the ice cream truck
on the highway.

108
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:35,142
Easy there, grubbs.

109
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:37,312
Keep those oversized mitts
off the car.

110
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:39,356
This is a brand-new issued vehicle.

111
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:41,457
I just picked it up.
It is cherry,

112
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:43,532
and it's gonna stay that way.

113
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:45,643
It's almost too sweet to drive.

114
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:49,027
- Smells like new car plus lemons.
- Yeah, it does.

115
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,631
- Leather?
- Pleather. Closest thing to it, though.

116
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,319
Hit me.
What do we got going here?

117
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:55,413
An accident.
The driver was taken to the hospital.

118
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:57,402
He's in stable condition
but unconscious.

119
00:06:57,927 --> 00:06:59,126
So what am I doing here?

120
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,463
Well, sir, nobody is sure
how the accident happened.

121
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,590
The key word in that sentence
is "accident".

122
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,107
What are we supposed to do,
go to the hospital and wait bedside

123
00:07:07,232 --> 00:07:09,105
while the ice cream man comes to?

124
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,886
Call me when somebody gets shot
or there's a dead body.

125
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:16,543
That's it.
That's the winner.

126
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:20,064
Get a 5x7 of that and a couple
of wallet sizes for my buddy here.

127
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:23,421
- What are they doing here?
- Maybe Vick called them in.

128
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:25,694
We are not here to hone in
on your case.

129
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,176
We just heard "ice cream"

130
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:29,663
on our police radio,
and it happened to be Gus's snack time.

131
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:31,985
Look, fellas. Tell you what.
You're welcome to it.

132
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,167
Have at it! Go for it.
Who knows?

133
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:36,954
Maybe you'll solve the great ice cream
crime caper of the century.

134
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,787
Crime of the century.

135
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,503
Still 91 years to solve that one.
Gus and I are gonna pace ourselves.

136
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:43,712
We accept.

137
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,423
You know we still have to file
the paperwork on the accident, right?

138
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:51,926
You thinking what I'm thinking?

139
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,223
Hell of a lot of strawberry
shortcake bars,

140
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,350
destroyed.

141
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,309
Before they even had a chance,
buddy.

142
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,729
<i>Shawn sensed someone might've tampered
with the truck before the accident.</i>

143
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,447
Anyone tried tracking Shawn's phone?

144
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:33,332
His GPS must not be working.
They can't get anything.

145
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:36,756
"Ocone yelrfx sig... "

146
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:39,210
How does he expect us
to find him with this cat scratch?

147
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:41,919
We can do this. It's a text.
They're abbreviations.

148
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:45,334
That's like that. You're out of the loop
on what the young people are doing now.

149
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,832
"The young people"?

150
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:50,380
Yeah, fact check.
I'm a little younger than you.

151
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:51,673
You're sure?

152
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:54,676
You're kidding, right?

153
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:58,522
With all due respect, Spencer,
I know that you were a good cop.

154
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:02,071
But I'm still on the force, and maybe
I'm a little more viable at this point.

155
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:03,451
We'll see.

156
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,564
You hear them out loud,
you could trigger some stuff.

157
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,278
"Ocone."

158
00:10:12,843 --> 00:10:13,843
Cone.

159
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:16,907
Maybe the "o" is on its own.
Maybe it could be it's own word.

160
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:19,326
O... outreach, outhouse cone.

161
00:10:19,843 --> 00:10:22,055
Oval cone, orange cone, or...

162
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:24,581
Orange cone.
Construction.

163
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:27,169
Could this be pertaining
to some sort of construction?

164
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,581
"Yelrfx."

165
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:29,920
Yellow reflector.

166
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,409
"Peac sig, peac sig."
What the hell is a peac sig?

167
00:10:32,534 --> 00:10:33,590
I'm not sure.

168
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:35,632
But I do know
a stretch of road on the 166

169
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:37,803
that's been under construction
for more than a month.

170
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:39,423
It's worth a shot.

171
00:10:44,695 --> 00:10:47,579
So Shawn has a psychic hunch
about this ice cream truck.

172
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:49,020
Where does that lead you?

173
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,822
<i>So we found out
who was servicing those trucks</i>

174
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:55,821
<i>and decided to pay them a visit
the next day.</i>

175
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,490
Fire in the hole, huh?

176
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,663
- Hey, there.
- Can I help you?

177
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:06,262
I sure hope so.

178
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:08,834
I assume you're one of the mechanics
that works here at the shop.

179
00:11:09,965 --> 00:11:11,215
I just started.

180
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:13,647
- Who are you?
- My name is Shawn Spencer.

181
00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:16,465
This is
my associate Donut Holestein.

182
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:20,262
- Garth Longmore.
- "Garth Longmore"?

183
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,152
I feel bad. I should've come up
with something better for you.

184
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:26,935
What do you want?

185
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,319
That's a fair question.
Deserves an answer.

186
00:11:29,444 --> 00:11:31,144
Donut, you got anything?

187
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:33,844
Mr. Longmore,
with a name like Longmore,

188
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:36,315
have you given any thought to...

189
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,895
getting involved
in the adult pictures?

190
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,157
- What?
- Sorry.

191
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:43,618
Do you know any reason why a truck
may have welding marks underneath it?

192
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:48,710
Without seeing the truck for myself,
I wouldn't know for sure.

193
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:51,555
But...

194
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:54,394
Welding's usually
used to repair a crack

195
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,464
or reinforce steel
that's been compromised in some way.

196
00:11:58,555 --> 00:12:01,635
You guys looking for some repairs
or you need a truck or what?

197
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:05,307
I, sir, am starting a new business.

198
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:08,214
I'm going to need to create
a vehicle that combines

199
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:09,989
a standard Wienermobile

200
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,522
with a Zamboni.

201
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:14,566
Can these two things
be welded together into one?

202
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:17,650
The simple mission statement
for my venture is

203
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:19,672
to create the perfect juicy Wiener

204
00:12:19,797 --> 00:12:23,185
and the perfect icy surface
to enjoy said Wiener on.

205
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,365
Now,
to be completely frank with you...

206
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:27,829
No pun intended...

207
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:30,040
The majority of my investors
have yet

208
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,703
to see the brilliance
of this business plan.

209
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:37,332
Thank you for your time.

210
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:40,402
You know what?
Hold onto that thought, and I'm gonna...

211
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,567
I'm gonna grab
one of these pamphlets here.

212
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:44,922
And I'm gonna call you,
Garth Longmore,

213
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:47,265
when I'm ready
to build my first prototype.

214
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,602
Okay, so Shawn figured out
what exactly from this venture?

215
00:12:51,894 --> 00:12:54,016
He was convinced
that the truck had been tampered with,

216
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:57,234
he was going to need a different tactic
if he was gonna get any real answers.

217
00:12:57,645 --> 00:12:58,645
Or...

218
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:00,802
Maybe just one of these.

219
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:03,237
Let's go see this Garth Longmore.

220
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:10,384
Okay, listen up.
I am detective Juliet O'Hara.

221
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:12,465
I am looking for a garth Longmore.

222
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,200
Anyone want to step up?

223
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:16,128
Longmore quit just yesterday.
He ain't here.

224
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,546
He quit? He just started.

225
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,132
Hell of a mechanic on top of it.

226
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,813
Did he give a reason for quitting?

227
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:24,511
Judging by the car he pulled away in,
maybe he won the lottery.

228
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:27,013
- What kind of car was he driving?
- '70 yellow roadrunner.

229
00:13:27,343 --> 00:13:29,266
Is this supposed to be a nice car?

230
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:32,093
What? Don't look at me.
I drive an echo.

231
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:34,588
Son,
are you wearing children's pajamas?

232
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,983
Can we move on, please? Did he leave
a forwarding address or anything?

233
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:42,571
But... if you find him, let me know,
because he walked off with my mig gun.

234
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:44,092
He had a gun?

235
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,151
It's not a gun. It's a mig gun.
It's used for welding.

236
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:48,644
All right, thank you.

237
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,043
What do you do
when an assailant is chasing you?

238
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:10,826
Do we have to do this?

239
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:12,767
You really don't like me, do you?

240
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,487
One day you'll thank me.

241
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:19,231
Once you get some distance,
change your course.

242
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:21,103
Never run in a straight line!

243
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:24,128
Straight line is the shortest distance
between two people.

244
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:25,030
Zigzag!

245
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,296
That's right!

246
00:14:26,421 --> 00:14:28,825
That's right! Thatta boy!
Throw them off their course!

247
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,706
This is the area. There's construction
for the next 6 miles.

248
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:14,371
There's our "peac sig".

249
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:18,583
It's a peace sign.

250
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:20,573
That's what Shawn saw.

251
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:23,255
Wait. Yellow reflector.

252
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:25,966
Orange cone.

253
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:29,511
- Stop the car right here. Just stop it!
- Why?

254
00:15:35,124 --> 00:15:36,774
God, I love new brakes.

255
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:42,774
All right, what are we looking at?

256
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:49,948
This was from the car Shawn was in.

257
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:52,834
There's accidents up and down
this highway...

258
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,202
This is Shawn.

259
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,745
How can you be so sure?

260
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:58,582
Because I'm the one
who taught him how to do it.

261
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,166
This is all I have on Longmore.

262
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:03,795
- Does he have a record?
- Only record he has is of being dead.

263
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:08,216
- What do you mean?
- Garth Longmore died in 1956.

264
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:09,976
Criminals do this all the time.

265
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:12,921
They buy the social security numbers
off the deceased on the black market.

266
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:16,600
Clearly he didn't want anyone to know
who he was or what he wanted.

267
00:16:17,218 --> 00:16:19,394
Do you have any idea
what you've stumbled onto?

268
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:24,167
What have you got for me?

269
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:29,070
So we don't know the guy's name,
but he's definitely our bad guy.

270
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,964
- Any leads?
- All we got

271
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,557
is that he was last seen driving off
in a vintage 1970 Plymouth Road Runner,

272
00:16:34,682 --> 00:16:36,745
yellow with black racing stripes.
Have you seen it?

273
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,352
We may have seen part of it.

274
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:40,091
Yellow reflector is the last clue,

275
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:42,962
which means he must've escaped
somewhere around here.

276
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:44,544
He's close.

277
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:47,364
O'Hara, listen.

278
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:49,452
Tell McNab to come pick up my car.

279
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:51,757
It's off 166
just past mile marker 8.

280
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:55,228
If he touches anything other than
the door and 10 and 2 on the wheel,

281
00:16:55,353 --> 00:16:57,599
<i>I'll personally visit his nightmares
for all of eternity.</i>

282
00:16:57,944 --> 00:16:59,434
- Copy?
- Copy that.

283
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:02,479
Because Spencer and I
are going it on foot.

284
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:04,551
Let's go find my son.

285
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:52,278
Anybody in there?
Could use some help out here.

286
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:57,075
Open up if you're in there!

287
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:01,074
I've been shot.
And I'm being chased.

288
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,361
Could you call
the Santa Barbara Police Department

289
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:06,626
and ask
for detective Carlton Lassiter?

290
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,044
I'm sorry I'm getting blood...

291
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,589
No, slow down.

292
00:18:12,313 --> 00:18:14,197
We should hurry,
he's really motivated.

293
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:15,260
I got a phone.

294
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:22,225
- Tell me again who you need me to call.
- Detective Carlton...

295
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,393
Lassiter.

296
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:33,069
You really are incompetent,
aren't you?

297
00:18:33,508 --> 00:18:34,608
Aren't you?!

298
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:38,522
You couldn't do one simple thing.
It's the same as it was in the joint.

299
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:41,328
He surprised me, all right?
I had no choice.

300
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,411
But then
you couldn't just get him here.

301
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:47,292
How the hell do you escape
from the trunk of a car?

302
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:51,129
In his defense, I think
I'm the only kid whose father taught him

303
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,840
how to kick out a taillight
from the back of a trunk.

304
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,259
Shut your face.

305
00:18:57,363 --> 00:18:59,127
What if I didn't make it
back here in time

306
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:01,973
after having to go pick up your car
you just left on the road?

307
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:03,920
Idiot!

308
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,354
- Did you at least get the truck set?
- It's ready. Give me some credit.

309
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,259
We're this close to the money,
and you're screwing it up.

310
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,548
We don't need this distraction.

311
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:15,777
Not now.
I say we just shoot him in the head

312
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:17,697
and dump the body
and get on with this.

313
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:20,658
Guys,
if I could interject briefly here...

314
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,761
And this is me speaking
from my own experience...

315
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:25,817
That feels a little rash.

316
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,505
You're both
under a great deal of stress,

317
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,544
and I don't think now is the time
to make important life decisions.

318
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:34,172
I'll tell you what works for me,
and maybe it's...

319
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,790
it's just me.

320
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:38,009
Draw a hot bath.

321
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:40,303
It doesn't matter who goes first.

322
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:41,971
You got a smart mouth, huh?

323
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:44,010
Look, I got it under control.

324
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:46,653
You want me to shoot him right now?
I will.

325
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:48,845
- I'll take him out...
- Not to be a stickler, but...

326
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,271
you did shoot me once.

327
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,227
Are you listening to me?

328
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:56,157
I'm having a hard time
concentrating on anything but the gun.

329
00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:58,676
Could be my A.D.D. acting up.

330
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:01,068
I want you to imagine

331
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,498
a bullet coming from that gun

332
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:05,971
penetrating your skin
and lodging in your brain.

333
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:10,378
You know how easy
that would be for me?

334
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:13,545
Physically,

335
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:15,531
yes.

336
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,530
But I would imagine
that it would give you some pause

337
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:21,115
emotionally.

338
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,593
You don't know how lucky you are.

339
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,345
My idiot partner here
screwed up big-time.

340
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,977
But that's par for the course.

341
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:29,965
Now...

342
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:32,021
I pull this thing off,

343
00:20:32,382 --> 00:20:33,601
and we're out of here.

344
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:36,985
But if Einstein here screws up again,
you're gonna be my ticket.

345
00:20:37,522 --> 00:20:41,043
Now I got a hostage in my back pocket
just in case, but know this...

346
00:20:41,168 --> 00:20:42,743
One stupid move,

347
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:46,230
and I got more than enough plastic bags
for your body parts.

348
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:47,227
Got it?

349
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:50,295
I got it.

350
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,020
Note to self:

351
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:01,308
call Hefty with commercial idea.

352
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:06,119
Thanks

353
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:07,657
for duct-taping

354
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:10,310
my bullet hole with a chamois.

355
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,061
Maybe if you could

356
00:21:12,484 --> 00:21:14,533
mail me to my dad's house now.

357
00:21:14,658 --> 00:21:16,232
That'd be awesome.

358
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:23,781
What do I call you?

359
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:25,898
Mr. Blonde? Mr. Pink?

360
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,744
Shut it!

361
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,203
God, what is your problem?

362
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:36,054
You know, I...

363
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:38,808
I've heard people say

364
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,471
that with gunshot wounds,
it's really all about the shock,

365
00:21:42,596 --> 00:21:43,468
you know?

366
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:45,562
That at some point, you know,

367
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:48,944
the bullet wound itself just goes numb.
You can't feel anything.

368
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:50,016
Well,

369
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,384
it's not true.

370
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:52,927
I can say,

371
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,940
without a doubt, that this is
the most pain I've ever been in.

372
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,109
So if you wouldn't mind
turning the other direction,

373
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:02,594
I would very much like to weep,

374
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:04,948
- if that's okay.
- It's a flesh wound.

375
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:06,974
All right?

376
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,702
You're fine. Stop whining.

377
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:50,326
Hey, what are you doing here?

378
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:54,211
Man, it is the darnedest thing.

379
00:22:55,094 --> 00:22:56,539
The Yelp application

380
00:22:56,664 --> 00:22:58,159
on my iPhone here

381
00:22:58,284 --> 00:23:00,407
told me
that there should be a Starbucks,

382
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:02,588
right where we're standing.

383
00:23:03,444 --> 00:23:06,482
And unless you can make
caramel macchiatos with that...

384
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:07,900
with that pistol,

385
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,471
then Yelp is dead wrong.

386
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,890
- Stay where you are.
- Easy, man.

387
00:23:14,612 --> 00:23:15,812
Wait a minute.

388
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:17,887
I know you.

389
00:23:18,012 --> 00:23:19,522
You're Garth Longmore,

390
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,644
though I'm beginning to suspect
that's not your real name, is it?

391
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,236
By the looks of you, I'd say
it's probably something preppy.

392
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,488
Am I right?
Maybe Ryan

393
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,849
or Geoffrey

394
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,002
with a "G".

395
00:23:31,228 --> 00:23:32,578
I will shoot you.

396
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:35,165
Just relax.

397
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,874
It's creepy enough without the whole

398
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:41,169
gun-and-flashlight routine,
don't you think?

399
00:23:41,605 --> 00:23:43,345
We can talk.
We're just...

400
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,632
We're just two guys talking.
We're rational men speaking.

401
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:49,811
I know what's going on here,
and I get it.

402
00:23:50,902 --> 00:23:52,680
And it's an ingenious plan,

403
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,998
to be honest.

404
00:23:54,598 --> 00:23:56,398
Of course, if it was me...

405
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:58,853
I'd just be happy
stealing the ice cream.

406
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,132
So what was it like over there?

407
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:18,303
The jungle?

408
00:24:22,117 --> 00:24:24,286
- What are you talking about?
- Combat.

409
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:26,798
Must've been hell.

410
00:24:29,527 --> 00:24:30,877
How did you know?

411
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:32,207
I'm a psychic.

412
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:34,847
That's what I do.

413
00:24:35,914 --> 00:24:38,667
I think between the gunshot
and the head bashing,

414
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:42,105
my visions
are coming in kind of crazy,

415
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:43,755
but I can see them.

416
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,234
They're clear. They're sharp.
I see you.

417
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:47,946
Were you

418
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,530
like, special forces or a sniper?

419
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,108
I was.

420
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:53,366
LRRP.

421
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:54,450
LRRP?

422
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,850
Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol.

423
00:24:57,815 --> 00:24:59,457
It was a long time ago, though.

424
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,532
My skills have no time clock.

425
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,397
So you could probably
take a target from what?

426
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,125
800 yards?

427
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:09,988
1,200.

428
00:25:10,113 --> 00:25:11,968
If the wind conditions are right.

429
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:15,134
1,500 possibly.

430
00:25:16,618 --> 00:25:17,723
That's impressive.

431
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,976
Some people get pretty good
at that stuff.

432
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,851
It does beg the question,

433
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,619
why didn't you kill me
from three feet?

434
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:29,840
We both know you could've,
but you didn't.

435
00:25:31,462 --> 00:25:34,512
I suspect
it's because you're not really a killer,

436
00:25:34,848 --> 00:25:35,848
are you?

437
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:37,197
At least...

438
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:39,954
not anymore.

439
00:25:40,403 --> 00:25:42,790
I think it's time for you
to stop talking.

440
00:25:42,915 --> 00:25:44,215
No more talking.

441
00:25:56,671 --> 00:25:59,056
Think you can pick up the pace,
Mr. Viability?

442
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,915
There's an excellent chance
I was bitten by a tick back there.

443
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,270
I could be going
through the stages of Lyme disease.

444
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,522
- Man up, detective.
- What is it?

445
00:26:07,222 --> 00:26:08,522
Steroids, right?

446
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:10,188
You're juicing, aren't you?

447
00:26:10,313 --> 00:26:11,313
I knew it.

448
00:26:27,582 --> 00:26:28,932
He went this way.

449
00:26:42,128 --> 00:26:44,278
So this is where Shawn is living.

450
00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:47,412
Odd that it takes him being shot
and dragged away in a trunk

451
00:26:47,537 --> 00:26:50,864
- for me to actually get an invitation.
- You didn't have an invitation.

452
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:51,777
True.

453
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:54,779
This is
the old Mee Mee's Fluff n' Fold.

454
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,156
Shawn got a good deal.

455
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,243
- I hope so. It was a dry cleaners.
- It's kind of his thing.

456
00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:03,091
Last spring he stayed
at the old Color Me Mine space.

457
00:27:03,216 --> 00:27:05,357
All the saucers you see here,
he made.

458
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:07,532
Besides, it has its advantages.

459
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,837
- What are you doing?
- I'm not wearing these pajamas anymore.

460
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,215
So you're stealing his clothes?
He's not dead.

461
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,860
I'm not stealing anything.

462
00:27:16,857 --> 00:27:19,212
Holy crap.
Half these clothes are mine.

463
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:22,060
- This is my shirt.
- Let's split up and comb the place.

464
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:24,746
Shawn was here when he left you
the message about the rehearsal,

465
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:26,747
so there are clues
as to what he was doing

466
00:27:26,872 --> 00:27:28,761
or looking at that made him call you

467
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:32,024
and drive down to that stockyard
in the middle of the night.

468
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,490
You see anything?

469
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:37,368
I mean no.

470
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:41,117
Did Abigail move in?

471
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:42,089
What?

472
00:27:42,637 --> 00:27:44,870
- This is Shawn, remember?
- Right.

473
00:27:45,351 --> 00:27:49,125
Has he been particularly aggressive
about his hygiene,

474
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,045
or has he been
cross-dressing lately?

475
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,417
I think they've officially reached

476
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,676
the "he has a drawer,
she has a toothbrush" stage.

477
00:28:00,754 --> 00:28:02,304
And how's that going?

478
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,084
Not too sure.

479
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,018
- I think I found something.
- What?

480
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,199
Shawn grabbed this
from the auto shop.

481
00:28:09,324 --> 00:28:11,446
It was sitting here
next to the phone.

482
00:28:11,886 --> 00:28:13,739
This is what he was looking at
when he called!

483
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:15,086
Look at the bottom.

484
00:28:16,058 --> 00:28:18,317
"Expert mechanics
of all domestic and foreign vehicles.

485
00:28:18,442 --> 00:28:20,406
Engine work, transmissions,
exhaust systems... "

486
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:21,825
No, below that.

487
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,750
"Long-haul refrigeration,
armored transport."

488
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,622
I still don't get the connection
to the ice cream truck.

489
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,956
I think Shawn did.

490
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:32,562
I'm checking his history to see
what his most recent web searches were.

491
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:34,516
mentalistspoilers.com,

492
00:28:34,641 --> 00:28:36,988
billyzane.thumbnail/hair.com.

493
00:28:37,665 --> 00:28:38,841
No, here we are.

494
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,442
"armoredcar/santabarbara/theft."

495
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:43,868
Armored car theft.

496
00:28:43,993 --> 00:28:46,643
The ice cream truck
was just the rehearsal.

497
00:28:49,368 --> 00:28:52,267
I know you said not to talk,
but I got to be frank with you.

498
00:28:52,392 --> 00:28:54,119
It's always been an issue for me.

499
00:28:54,244 --> 00:28:57,109
You should've seen
my report cards in grade school.

500
00:28:57,234 --> 00:28:59,631
I like to talk out loud
when I'm working stuff out in my head.

501
00:28:59,756 --> 00:29:01,023
That's what I do.

502
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:02,831
Just feel free to ignore me, okay?

503
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:05,842
This is a really elaborate plan
you guys have going here.

504
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:09,031
I mean, you got the job as a mechanic
just to have access to the truck, right?

505
00:29:09,156 --> 00:29:10,306
That's smart.

506
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,626
Then instead of reinforcing the bottom,
you actually weakened it,

507
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,839
creating easy access
to get to the money.

508
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,004
The question is,

509
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,469
how are you gonna get to it
while the truck was still moving, right?

510
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,663
Sorry, man.
Like I said, this is all me.

511
00:29:25,788 --> 00:29:27,848
Just pretend like I'm not even here.
You tip it.

512
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,725
That's what you do.
You tip it over.

513
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:37,566
Once the car's tipped over,

514
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,656
you just crowbar open the trapdoor
and you make off with the dough.

515
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:47,326
<i>All right, let's light it up!</i>

516
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:50,204
<i>Come on, Rick.
Let's go! Let's go!</i>

517
00:29:52,193 --> 00:29:53,207
This time,

518
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,690
it's not about ice cream.

519
00:29:57,283 --> 00:30:00,083
You could still get one after,
if you'd like.

520
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:02,228
But it's gonna be real, man...

521
00:30:02,353 --> 00:30:03,878
The armored car, the money.

522
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:06,762
Question is,
where is it gonna go down?

523
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
And when?

524
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,465
What do you care?

525
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,311
You'll be dead.

526
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:39,861
You let me do all the talking,
got it?

527
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,881
Can I help you?

528
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:44,611
We're looking for a yellow Plymouth.
You seen it?

529
00:30:45,536 --> 00:30:48,053
As a matter of fact, I have.
You don't forget a car like that.

530
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,646
Pulled in about ten minutes ago
looking for gas.

531
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:54,018
Offered to fix his broken taillight
for him, though.

532
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,475
My and my partner
got a nice little mechanic business...

533
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,457
Did you happen
to see who was driving?

534
00:30:58,582 --> 00:31:01,027
I got a look at him.
A big, oafy-looking guy.

535
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:04,118
Not sure he had all his marbles.
He was kind of stupid, if you ask me.

536
00:31:04,243 --> 00:31:06,280
I sent him up four miles
to the next station.

537
00:31:06,686 --> 00:31:08,286
Was this guy with him?

538
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,862
No, that guy wasn't with him.

539
00:31:13,274 --> 00:31:15,498
Why, is that guy wanted
or something?

540
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,274
- You could say that.
- All right...

541
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,099
Thank you for your time.

542
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:21,712
- About four miles...
- That was about ten minutes ago?

543
00:31:30,201 --> 00:31:32,531
What was that all about?
I was gonna ask the questions.

544
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:33,692
Old habits.

545
00:31:33,817 --> 00:31:36,595
Cut it out, all right?
I'm in charge of this investigation.

546
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,993
God,
it's just like working with Shawn.

547
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:40,764
McNab, put out an APB
on the Plymouth

548
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:44,193
and alert all authorities to patrol
the 166 off the Horse Creek exit.

549
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:46,646
You got more questions?

550
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,923
Come on, Chatty Cathy,
we're wasting time.

551
00:31:49,048 --> 00:31:50,604
Want me to carry you?

552
00:31:52,729 --> 00:31:54,666
Because of your screwup,
now we got the cops

553
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:57,122
and what I figure must be this
guy's old man snooping around.

554
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,166
What's the big deal, man?
They took off.

555
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:02,470
Because I was thinking on my feet!

556
00:32:03,027 --> 00:32:04,121
I'm telling you.

557
00:32:04,737 --> 00:32:06,487
If you can't take care
of this, I'm gonna.

558
00:32:06,612 --> 00:32:08,346
Kid should've been dead an hour ago.

559
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,407
Fine, fine, fine.

560
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,604
"Fine, fine, fine," you nimrod.
You gonna do it or not?

561
00:32:13,729 --> 00:32:15,979
What do you want?
I did what I was supposed to do.

562
00:32:16,104 --> 00:32:17,506
You idiot, you did not!

563
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:19,134
- Get in there and do it!
- I did!

564
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:21,979
Jesus, of all the people
I could get linked up with...

565
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:29,697
Yeah, you want the money,
you better step up.

566
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:34,410
Gina?

567
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:38,003
Look, I'm sorry I hung up on you.
It was immature, I know.

568
00:32:38,128 --> 00:32:39,623
It's just my feelings were hurt,

569
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,823
<i>because I never heard back
from you...</i>

570
00:32:41,948 --> 00:32:42,918
It's fine.

571
00:32:43,244 --> 00:32:44,420
Get in there!

572
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:47,298
Look, it's really, really important
that you call the p...

573
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,924
More important than my feelings?

574
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:51,814
<i>- You are so self-centered!
- No, Gina, don't...</i>

575
00:32:51,939 --> 00:32:53,902
- What are you doing?
- It's not what you think.

576
00:32:54,027 --> 00:32:55,417
- Give me that!
- I swear!

577
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:58,040
I wasn't calling the police
or anything like that.

578
00:32:58,539 --> 00:32:59,479
Look, man.

579
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,788
I know this doesn't end well
for me, okay?

580
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:05,166
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time, and...

581
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,150
And I've made my peace with that.

582
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,488
But recently,

583
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,118
I met a girl,

584
00:33:11,437 --> 00:33:12,695
somebody special,

585
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,491
just like you did.

586
00:33:15,164 --> 00:33:16,351
Just like me?

587
00:33:16,853 --> 00:33:18,162
Yeah, I saw her in a vision.

588
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,604
She's beautiful.
She's got...

589
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:22,683
She's got red hair, right?

590
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:25,169
Most beautiful hair I've ever seen.

591
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:27,229
My girl's name's Abigail.

592
00:33:28,057 --> 00:33:29,006
What's yours?

593
00:33:31,883 --> 00:33:32,676
Maureen.

594
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:34,541
Maureen O'Hara.

595
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:35,846
No, better.

596
00:33:38,537 --> 00:33:41,727
Look, I just want to call her
and say good-bye.

597
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,578
That's it, no funny business.

598
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,382
You can watch me dial.
You can listen in.

599
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,728
If I say anything...

600
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:52,944
Anything that you don't like,
you can shoot me.

601
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:55,726
Deal?

602
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Count on it.

603
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:00,010
I will shoot you.

604
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:03,781
Thank you.

605
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:07,960
I found something!

606
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,538
There's a large transfer of money
to be delivered,

607
00:34:10,663 --> 00:34:12,063
close to $500,000.

608
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:14,182
That's the schedule and route.

609
00:34:17,604 --> 00:34:19,681
This call is to say good-bye.

610
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:22,038
- Shawn, are you okay?
- Try to get anything, a location.

611
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:23,166
Where are you?

612
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,665
<i>Don't... don't ask me any questions,</i>

613
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,940
'cause I can't say anything else.

614
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,359
If you care about me,
you'll understand.

615
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,118
I'm listening.

616
00:34:34,243 --> 00:34:37,866
<i>I'm not gonna be able to have
much of a future anymore.</i>

617
00:34:37,991 --> 00:34:40,841
But if you look back
at where we were,

618
00:34:41,366 --> 00:34:42,975
I'll be there, okay?

619
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:44,647
Back?

620
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:47,625
What are you talking about?

621
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:50,462
The wind chimes
that I got you for your birthday,

622
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:55,334
every time you hear them
from now on,

623
00:34:57,134 --> 00:34:58,262
that'll be me.

624
00:34:59,928 --> 00:35:02,266
First of all,
you are going to be fine.

625
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:04,977
We are going to find you, okay?
Don't worry.

626
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,811
This is supposed to be
a good-bye call.

627
00:35:06,936 --> 00:35:08,689
Now tell her you love her,
and let's go.

628
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:12,192
Listen, before... before I go,
I have to say one more thing.

629
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,010
Of course, Shawn.
What is it?

630
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:14,986
Say it.

631
00:35:15,928 --> 00:35:17,569
I need you to know that...

632
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:20,696
I love you.

633
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:30,502
- I think that I...
- Good-bye, Abigail.

634
00:35:35,982 --> 00:35:37,468
Hang it up now! That's it!

635
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,967
That's it! It's done!

636
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:40,930
How stupid letting him use a phone?

637
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,694
The cops are probably on their way!

638
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:45,517
- He was just calling his girlfriend!
- It's over!

639
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,295
I'm putting an end to this.

640
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:52,568
Lassiter, I just spoke to Shawn.
He's alive.

641
00:35:52,696 --> 00:35:54,716
He was trying to give me clues
about something.

642
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:56,612
I didn't understand.
None of it made sense.

643
00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:57,943
What?

644
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:59,943
Juliet, wait.
Slow down.

645
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:02,069
Going back?
Wind chimes?

646
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:05,087
- No, that doesn't mean anything to me.
- Wait!

647
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:10,209
He's back at the gas station!

648
00:36:11,571 --> 00:36:12,819
Come on! Come on!

649
00:36:12,944 --> 00:36:16,048
Can you make it back
to the Mariposa exit off the 166?

650
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:18,681
<i>There's a gas station two blocks up.</i>

651
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:22,262
That's where the robbery'll take place.
I'll explain when we get there.

652
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:23,472
Let's go.

653
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:52,381
Where's Shawn?

654
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,773
All right, let's do this.
O'Hara, stay close. You know the drill.

655
00:36:58,898 --> 00:37:01,211
- Keys.
- I'm not covered for someone else.

656
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:03,460
I'm a police detective
and a certified pursuit driver.

657
00:37:03,585 --> 00:37:04,837
I think you'll be okay.

658
00:37:04,962 --> 00:37:05,774
Keys.

659
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:31,024
Go, team!

660
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,003
- Gun it, Jules! Give it all it's got!
- This is all it's got.

661
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,898
Is that my shirt?

662
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,554
Look at you, buddy!
You're like Vin Diesel!

663
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,974
That makes Jules Michelle Rodriguez
and you Paul Walker!

664
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,023
- This is no good!
- Don't worry, you'll be all right.

665
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:35,586
I know, I'll be fine.

666
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:37,960
I just really
don't want to be Paul Walker,

667
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:39,524
not even for one day.

668
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,773
You could be Lucas Black
from Tokyo Drift,

669
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:43,929
but then we wouldn't be
in the movie with you!

670
00:38:44,054 --> 00:38:45,030
That's weird.

671
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:47,449
I'll just be Walker.

672
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,327
You ready, buddy?
I'm gonna jump on your hood.

673
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,120
You must be out of your damn mind!

674
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:54,581
It's a company car.
Jump on Lassiter's!

675
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,882
Move closer!

676
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:06,399
Do not jump on this vehicle!

677
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:08,095
This is a brand-new vehicle!

678
00:39:08,477 --> 00:39:10,337
Look, man, I have been shot!

679
00:39:10,462 --> 00:39:12,432
I am jumping on somebody's car!

680
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,085
- Stop the car!
- Got him!

681
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,820
Don't you dare stop
this car, Lassie!

682
00:39:25,134 --> 00:39:27,280
Hang on tight!
Hold on! Hold on!

683
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:30,367
Great idea, dad!
I was thinking of not doing that.

684
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:34,955
Lay back!

685
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:43,424
Did he hit my car?

686
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,300
- Gun it, old man!
- Watch this!

687
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,687
- What the hell are you doing?
- Which Spencer are you talking to?

688
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:00,439
Doesn't matter! You're the same!

689
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:01,455
Am not!

690
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,319
Dad, I have a clear shot.
Give me the gun.

691
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,693
Do it!

692
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,123
Drop it!

693
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:29,926
Drop it now!
Hands where I can see them!

694
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:31,385
Hands!

695
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:40,537
Come here.
Come here son.

696
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,089
That's it.

697
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:50,498
Nice shooting, detective.

698
00:40:52,647 --> 00:40:54,242
Did you just call me "detective"?

699
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:00,857
Shouldn't we wait
for Diesel and Rodriguez

700
00:41:00,982 --> 00:41:02,751
before you slap the cuffs on him?

701
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:18,726
You know, I...

702
00:41:19,168 --> 00:41:21,559
I had to tell Juliet
that I loved her.

703
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:25,943
- Was it awkward?
- Little bit.

704
00:41:26,558 --> 00:41:29,682
Of course, at the time, I was more
concerned about not getting shot again.

705
00:41:29,807 --> 00:41:32,247
Guess you were just doing
what you had to do.

706
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:33,824
The weird thing is...

707
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:36,715
I think she was about
to say it back to me.

708
00:41:37,934 --> 00:41:39,871
I bet she was just playing along,

709
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,524
doing what she had to do.

710
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:45,793
Yeah, you're probably right.

711
00:41:48,246 --> 00:41:50,557
Oh, look, that's weird.
It's for you.

712
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:51,682
Who's that?

713
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:52,980
Just say hello.

714
00:41:57,185 --> 00:41:58,185
Gina who?

715
00:41:58,653 --> 00:42:01,410
Will you stop yelling in my ear?
I don't even know you.

716
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,378
Dude, tell her we're going
for cheesecake.
