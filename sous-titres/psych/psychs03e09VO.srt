1
00:00:15,953 --> 00:00:18,434
It's barely morning, just hold on.
I know you're excited.

2
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:22,288
Your adrenalin is rushing, your heart is
pumping just like it got a big case

3
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:23,936
this is a hot crime scene.

4
00:00:24,798 --> 00:00:26,601
I just want to see
what Santa brought me.

5
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,201
And you will, soon enough.

6
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:32,834
First, I want you to recreate everything
that went down here last night.

7
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:42,528
Santa came in.

8
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,836
He sat down.

9
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:47,793
Ate his milk and cookies

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,302
Put the presents under the tree.

11
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,390
Then something spooked,
and he ran off

12
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,740
He tried.

13
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:02,259
Maybe you woke up a little earlier
than he thought.

14
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:03,945
It's a pity too because

15
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:07,107
He didn't had a chance to finish
to gather your brand new bicycle.

16
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:16,617
Merry Christmas, Shawn.

17
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:23,415
What took you so long?
I have to get to my mom and dad's.

18
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,613
Choosing the perfect
holiday gift takes time, Gus.

19
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,331
You can't cut corners.

20
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:31,715
You have to customize.
Match the gift...

21
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:33,384
With the individual.

22
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:35,076
Look...

23
00:01:35,201 --> 00:01:36,970
I took our Halloween decorations

24
00:01:37,712 --> 00:01:39,252
and put Santa hats on them.

25
00:01:39,377 --> 00:01:40,462
What do you think?

26
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:43,955
Look, can we do this later?

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,938
My sister Joy's flight gets
in any minute now.

28
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:48,870
- You have plenty of time.
- No I don't.

29
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:50,737
She usually works
during the holidays.

30
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:52,799
London, Paris, Hong Kong.

31
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:55,531
Now that she's home, we have to spend
as much time together as possible.

32
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,201
All that time away from home for work.
Precisely why I didn't go to law school.

33
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,161
Yeah, that and the school part.

34
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,582
Well, hello there.

35
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:09,586
- May I help you?
- Are you Mr. Psych?

36
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:12,495
I'm Mr. Shawn.

37
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,493
And this is Scrooge Jones.

38
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,635
We're psychic detectives.
Who might you be?

39
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:19,203
My name's Brittany.
Mr. Shawn...

40
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:22,018
- I need to hire you.
- I see.

41
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:24,518
- What for?
- To get Santa out of jail.

42
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:28,230
All I have is $1.38.
I hope it's enough.

43
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,012
- We couldn't possibly accept that.
- He's right.

44
00:02:31,137 --> 00:02:32,484
What else do you have?

45
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:36,155
The policemen dragged him away
from the Santa's village in Solvang.

46
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:39,852
- Please. You have to help him.
- Don't worry, Brittany.

47
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:42,697
There are some wonderful
public defenders in the North Pole.

48
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:46,335
- Santa will be out in no time.
- But if he's not out by Christmas eve,

49
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,083
he can't deliver his toys.

50
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,932
This is...

51
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:52,880
This is a matter for the police.

52
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:56,341
And we never interfere
with police matters.

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,404
- I understand.
- Okay.

54
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:00,806
Good.

55
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:09,980
Oh, boy.

56
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:15,590
What are you supposed to do
when a child's crying like this?

57
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,069
You cave.

58
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:22,868
Mr. Shawn and I will get Santa
out as soon as we get back.

59
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,378
Thank you, scrooge jones.

60
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,207
Thank you, Mr. Shawn.

61
00:03:30,948 --> 00:03:31,953
Let's go.

62
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,989
We're back from the airport.

63
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:46,328
- Hey, sis!
- Gussie!

64
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,061
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

65
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:53,015
You don't know what it's been like
not having anyone to talk to.

66
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,942
Well, I want to hear more about
this psychic detective agency.

67
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,278
It's very impressive.

68
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:00,503
As we found out last year

69
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:02,658
when we were both brought
up on murder charges.

70
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:04,534
I still find that hard to believe.

71
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:07,336
Well, we were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

72
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,950
Nobody to blame.

73
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:16,088
You two must be pretty good.

74
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:19,549
It's funny...
I don't remember you being psychic.

75
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:22,838
When did this happen?

76
00:04:23,782 --> 00:04:25,889
- High school.
- Did you two just look at each other?

77
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,170
You just did it again.

78
00:04:30,514 --> 00:04:32,896
As if to corroborate
what you are going to say.

79
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:35,407
Joy, what is this?

80
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:38,435
We're not on trial here.

81
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,094
- It's Christmas...
- Came through the door...

82
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:43,727
- This is not a court room.
- It's all about love.

83
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:46,326
So why are you both
striking defensive poses?

84
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,124
I was just, I was keeping it loose.

85
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:55,168
I'm going to be late to work.

86
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,629
Don't forget,
I'm covering the night shift.

87
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,778
No, joy just got here.
Raytheon can wait.

88
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:02,709
Government planes don't
make themselves...

89
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:03,635
yet.

90
00:05:04,573 --> 00:05:08,203
It's okay, daddy. It'll give me and Gus
a chance to catch up.

91
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:09,727
All right, well...

92
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:13,159
- I'll see you in the morning, then.
- Okay, bye.

93
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,052
Sweetheart, your room's all ready.

94
00:05:16,177 --> 00:05:18,319
And I'll just be
a little longer in the kitchen.

95
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,193
Let me get this up
to your room for you.

96
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,002
I doubt you need all of them.

97
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:27,185
You can get them later.

98
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,483
Synchro: Arrow, mpm

99
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,622
www.sub-way.fr / www.seriessub.com

100
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:08,731
Wait a minute.

101
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:11,536
What are we doing?
This can not happen.

102
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:12,914
I know.

103
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,540
- It was a one time fling
- ten years ago, and that's it.

104
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:18,165
- I never told.
- Well, thank God.

105
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:20,348
Gus would be crushed.

106
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:22,255
We're both adults, okay?

107
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:24,043
No, that's where you're wrong.

108
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:25,977
We're not adults.
You're Gus' big sister

109
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:27,908
with the tassels on your bike.

110
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:31,598
And I'm Gus' best friend,
who put a frog on top of your head.

111
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,578
Listen, listen,

112
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:36,436
we can't fool around.
Especially not in your living room.

113
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,396
And for Gus' sake,
we have to fight it.

114
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,949
Speak for yourself.

115
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:46,431
You know, Joy, since you're
so interested in psych,

116
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:49,240
you should spend as much time
with me and Shawn as possible.

117
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,426
Great!

118
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,928
This is where we do our thing.
Where it all goes down.

119
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:57,268
Where the magic happens.

120
00:06:57,393 --> 00:06:59,850
You know you repeat yourself
when you're trying to impress someone?

121
00:06:59,975 --> 00:07:02,263
Yeah, right.
Whatever. Please.

122
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,053
- You kind of do.
- Told you so. Touche.

123
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,867
You can't touche yourself.

124
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,416
Sure I can.
Your bad.

125
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,790
It's not "my bad."
You can't "my bad" for someone else.

126
00:07:10,915 --> 00:07:12,135
But you ain't mad at it.

127
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,713
- Know what you saying'?
- Stop.

128
00:07:13,838 --> 00:07:16,643
Mr. Spencer, Mr. Guster,
I don't remember hiring you for a case.

129
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:19,387
We're here researching a case for...

130
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:21,029
another

131
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:23,274
client.
Detective o'hara is expecting us.

132
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:24,644
All three of you?

133
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,490
This is my sister, Joy.
She's our guest.

134
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,741
Technically you are guests so you
don't have the right to bring your own.

135
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,786
I'm sorry, chief.
Joy was just excited to see what we do.

136
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,873
Have you ever seen a movie
about high school?

137
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,844
Then you've pretty much seen
what they do.

138
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:43,670
Chief is just a joker.

139
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:46,756
Sorry, no visitors
beyond this point.

140
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,410
Wait here just a moment.

141
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,925
Jules, wait up.

142
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:03,074
I'm sorry. I got your message.
Things have just been

143
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,441
really hectic around here.
Something about the holidays.

144
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:08,370
Speaking of which, I'm sensing the Santa
we've been looking for

145
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:09,737
would've been brought in.

146
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:12,925
Must've been that fight down at Santa's
village in Solvang, we got a call.

147
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,311
We sent a paddy wagon
down to assist the county.

148
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:17,701
- Where are they now?
- Unfortunately, some poor guy

149
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:20,400
was knocked unconscious,
so we're holding everyone

150
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:24,120
in a holding cell until we can find
out who's going to face assault charges.

151
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:25,086
This way.

152
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:30,972
And here we are.

153
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:34,777
He really does look like Santa.

154
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,618
Excuse me, sir,
could you please step out of the way?

155
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:40,956
That's your Santa.

156
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:43,397
Of course it is.

157
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:47,165
Let me know
if you need anything else.

158
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,120
Our Santa only has defensive wounds.
There's no way he put anybody in a coma.

159
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:10,006
And I can tell
from that guy's bracelet

160
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:11,734
that he's a master of krav maga.

161
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:14,885
- His fists are deadly weapons.
- Since when can you read hebrew?

162
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:17,388
Since I spent a summer working
at a hasidic deli.

163
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,316
Those were good times.

164
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:22,058
Shlomo.

165
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:28,204
- I'm getting something here.
- I'm seeing hands fast as lighting.

166
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:30,681
- It's more than a little upsetting.
- Kung fu fighting.

167
00:09:30,806 --> 00:09:33,005
That's right.
Someone was a master of martial arts.

168
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,907
- But not Santa.
- He brings peace and joy.

169
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,586
That's right. The man I'm thinking
of is a lethal machine,

170
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,036
trained in the martial arts
of the middle east,

171
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:43,183
That's him. He's the one who knocked
the victim unconscious

172
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,332
and that should serve time
for assault.

173
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,542
Assault?!

174
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,837
I was minding my own business.

175
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:51,725
I only hit that guy because
I was defending Santa.

176
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,884
Nice job, Shawn.
You just saved us hours of processing.

177
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,021
Consider it your Christmas gift.

178
00:09:57,406 --> 00:09:59,171
Take him to the interrogation room,
please.

179
00:09:59,296 --> 00:10:01,286
And make sure this one gets
back to Santa's village

180
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:03,285
to spread some Christmas cheer.

181
00:10:03,848 --> 00:10:05,807
There's a very sweet
little girl counting on it.

182
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:08,042
- We just saved Christmas.
- What?

183
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,390
So when the cluster
of bullets is very tight,

184
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,449
we refer to that as precision.
Not to be confused with accuracy.

185
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:21,494
Which has to do with the proximity
to the intended target.

186
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:23,558
What's going on here?

187
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:27,162
Just having a conversation
with your delightful sister.

188
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:28,755
Really?

189
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:30,747
Let me get that for you.

190
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:34,173
"Get that for you."
I know exactly what that means.

191
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:37,177
Shawn, what is the sentence
for assaulting a police officer?

192
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:39,470
It's okay, buddy.

193
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:42,431
Sorry, Gus is a little overprotective
of his older sister.

194
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,751
What's the deal with you
and people's sisters anyway?

195
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:47,353
First Vick's and now mine?
And aren't you still married?

196
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,215
Stand down, Guster.
We were simply having a conversation.

197
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,044
- Geez.
- You snow white...

198
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:55,653
Lassie... I think Dobson
is calling for you.

199
00:10:58,978 --> 00:11:00,660
Really nice to meet you.

200
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,914
The nerve of some people.

201
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,290
You know, Gus, hey.

202
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:10,414
I'm a big girl.

203
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:12,544
And I can see whoever I want,
thank you.

204
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:16,757
No, not if that person's supposed
to be a friend of mine, Hell no.

205
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:24,764
You weren't there to see
it's little face looking up at me.

206
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:26,963
Meowing for milk
and warmth and shelter.

207
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:28,407
Were you, garth?

208
00:11:29,282 --> 00:11:30,282
Fine,

209
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:31,541
thanks.

210
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,816
Apparently, my apartment
is infested with fleas.

211
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:36,943
It may or may not have something
to do with the stray cat that I took in.

212
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:39,279
But they can't blame me for
infesting the entire building.

213
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:41,782
One adult female flea
lays thousands of eggs.

214
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,038
That's a little bit frightening.

215
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,037
I'll need a place
to crash while they fumigate.

216
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:50,082
I'd stay at my dad's, but
he's got some of his lodge buddies.

217
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,418
Gus and I are staying
with our folks for the holidays,

218
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:54,128
why don't you stay with us?

219
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:58,257
I don't know, joy.

220
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:00,676
- Shawn, please.
- There, it's settled.

221
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:05,305
- Look.
- What is it?

222
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:08,642
I saved your butt this time, daddy.

223
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,454
You're lucky I didn't
leave you in there to rot.

224
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,567
Now we only have three days left.
Don't screw up again.

225
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:20,988
Geez.
She's a little con artist.

226
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:23,629
I bet she had more
than $1.38 on her too.

227
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:28,078
Dude, we got conned on Christmas.

228
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,719
I don't like having my emotions
toyed with like that.

229
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:33,000
We ran fingerprints on everyone.

230
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:35,432
His name was Carl Wilcox.

231
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,505
And according to police records,
he is a known con man.

232
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:41,133
<i>Now we only have three days left.</i>

233
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,761
Whatever it is, they must
be planning it for the 24th.

234
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,826
We just need to get proof.

235
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:48,235
Thank you, Jules.

236
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:09,775
What?
What?

237
00:13:17,147 --> 00:13:19,078
There you go, ma'am.
Enjoy.

238
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,516
- Have you been good this year?
- All right, so that will be 20 wallets

239
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:32,839
and one 8 x 10.

240
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:36,487
We can send it to a home address.
Just check the box.

241
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:41,151
Okay, now you keep those grades up.

242
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,694
So that we can give you
everything on your list, okay?

243
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:45,220
All right, go ahead.

244
00:13:46,238 --> 00:13:48,326
Who's next in line to see Santa?

245
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:49,553
Excuse us.

246
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:52,704
I don't think Santa's lap
is big enough for you boys.

247
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:54,328
Cut the crap, Carl.

248
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:56,541
We know you conned us
into getting you out of jail.

249
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:00,670
Okay, not here, all right?

250
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,130
Santa's going to take a five.
Be right back.

251
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:15,060
What blind kid
did you steal that from?

252
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:18,062
Why would a blind kid
have a video game?

253
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:22,316
You have cooties on your face.
She started it.

254
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,444
- You started it.
- She gave me the stink eye.

255
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:26,804
- She's a little...
- Okay, look guys...

256
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:28,876
I appreciate
you getting me out of jail,

257
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,538
but I'm working here, okay?

258
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:32,869
Why don't you come back
when we have a lunch break?

259
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:36,456
Or you could tell us about that little
con you have planned for the 24th.

260
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:39,074
Here's the thing, Carl,
we're on to you.

261
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:40,914
Both of you.

262
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:43,880
Couple of smart guys, huh?

263
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:46,893
You're too smart for your own good.

264
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:48,985
... this guy...

265
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,536
Don't hit me!

266
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,626
Not so fast, st. Nick, huh?

267
00:14:58,312 --> 00:14:59,813
International sign of guilt.

268
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,194
Those were the same two guys
who I saw cut in line.

269
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:08,588
- They don't even have kids.
- This is not good.

270
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:10,740
All right, enough of you two.

271
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:12,447
- Let's go.
- What?

272
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:27,797
I've never been kicked out
of Santa's village before.

273
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:30,801
- You get used to it.
- I don't want. It's humiliating.

274
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,554
We still don't know what crime

275
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:35,047
Carl and Brittany
are planning for Christmas eve.

276
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:38,332
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

277
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:39,487
'Night, Joy.

278
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:43,472
See you in the morning.

279
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:48,359
It's like they're mocking us,
you know.

280
00:15:48,484 --> 00:15:51,281
Feels like a slap in the face.
And not a Rhett Butler slap,

281
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:52,904
an Ike Turner slap.

282
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,912
But we still have a few days
to figure it out. Let's just go to bed.

283
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:58,037
Cool.

284
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,876
- Good night, dude.
- 'Night.

285
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:11,217
This is ridiculous.

286
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:14,714
- Shawn.
- Mr. Guster?

287
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:17,461
You're supposed to be asleep.
Why are you here?

288
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:20,417
I thought that I heard
a noise or something.

289
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:23,667
You're supposed to be working the night
shift. What are you doing home?

290
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,306
I forgot something.

291
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:28,901
So I guess you'll be going back
to work then.

292
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,298
And I guess you,

293
00:18:30,803 --> 00:18:32,478
you'll be going back to sleep?

294
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:37,965
- Why aren't you leaving?
- It's my house, I leave when I want to.

295
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,158
You want to tell me
what you were looking for down here?

296
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:48,582
I'm getting something here.

297
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,965
You weren't at work
like you said you were.

298
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,755
I see a projector,
a movie projector.

299
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:57,466
- You're not going to be reading me.
- Yes.

300
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,844
Please, that's ridiculous.

301
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:02,263
- Stick a move.
- Please don't do that.

302
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,173
I've already had the vision.

303
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:07,179
It's over, the vision is over,
I've had it, it's done.

304
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:12,439
You lied to your family
about working the night shift.

305
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:13,882
Truth is,

306
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,279
I lost my job at Raytheon
a month ago.

307
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:21,297
I'm sorry.

308
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:25,991
- Why are you keeping it a secret?
- It's Christmas time.

309
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:27,455
Joy's home.

310
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,034
I didn't want everybody to worry.

311
00:19:31,107 --> 00:19:34,077
So I go out on interviews
all through the day.

312
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:38,349
And hang out at the movies
or a coffee shop at night.

313
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:42,121
My family thinks I'm doing
my night shift. Remember.

314
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,236
This is between...

315
00:19:44,465 --> 00:19:47,589
- me and you and that lamp, all right?
- You're saying the lawn chair

316
00:19:47,714 --> 00:19:49,643
- isn't trustworthy...
- Be serious, boy!

317
00:19:50,214 --> 00:19:52,229
- So, we're cool, right?
- We'll cool, Mr. G.

318
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:55,792
I would hate to think that things
changed because you betrayed my trust.

319
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,746
Believe me...
You don't have to worry about that.

320
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:06,373
The problem is,
Carl already knows we're on to him.

321
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,120
He's not going to let us get close
enough to figure out what he's up to.

322
00:20:09,245 --> 00:20:10,254
Unless...

323
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:16,012
- You guys ready to grab lunch?
- Good idea. You could use a pick-me-up.

324
00:20:16,137 --> 00:20:18,827
I'm sorry, man.
I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

325
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:21,035
Unless... Of course we could figure out
a way to snoop

326
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,843
around the village
without Carl knowing.

327
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:25,221
- How are we going to do that?
- I can help.

328
00:20:35,337 --> 00:20:36,806
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

329
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:39,902
We can use all the help
we can get for the Christmas rush.

330
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:54,832
All right, enough of you two.
Let's go.

331
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:02,237
- Merry christmas!
- Merry christmas.

332
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:04,488
- Great job.
- Thank you.

333
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:06,479
Make sure you sign up
for Carl's shift.

334
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:09,281
Stay close to him. Let us know what
you find out. We'll pick you up later.

335
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:10,475
I'm on it.

336
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,649
What the heck you looking at?

337
00:21:17,535 --> 00:21:19,226
That is a beautiful wreath.

338
00:21:20,457 --> 00:21:21,400
I hear that.

339
00:21:34,122 --> 00:21:36,821
So? Did Carl realize
you were checking up on him?

340
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:39,169
- He didn't suspect a thing.
- What did you find out?

341
00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:41,880
I'm sorry guys, but Carl seems
like he's on the up and up.

342
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:44,490
You didn't see him talking
with any shady characters?

343
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:48,492
No, just the kids. And you know what,
he's a pretty good Santa.

344
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,048
He just doesn't ask them
what they want, he asks the kids

345
00:21:51,173 --> 00:21:53,947
what they like most about Christmas,
what they're most thankful for,

346
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:56,687
what relatives they're going to visit.
It's quite touching.

347
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:59,731
So that'll be 20 wallets
and one 8 x 10.

348
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:03,610
We can send it to a home address,
just check the box.

349
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:06,192
- Wait a minute, that's it.
- What?

350
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:08,448
- What do you see?
- Are you having a vision?

351
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,585
It's a small, it's a small...

352
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:12,063
Tiny vision.

353
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:15,987
Cold shower, baseball stats,
watching my grandmother eat meatloaf.

354
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:17,291
I see Carl and Ted.

355
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:21,279
Standing in front of a computer screen,
it's a list of addresses.

356
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:25,033
Getting the information from the kids
about who's traveling over the holidays

357
00:22:25,158 --> 00:22:27,576
gives them a built-in list
of empty houses to rob.

358
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:29,769
That's why he had to be out of jail
on Christmas eve.

359
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:32,319
We need to warn the police
before tomorrow.

360
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:36,420
What the heck are you looking at?

361
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,208
That.

362
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:41,765
- Look how cute that little snowman is.
- I hear that.

363
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:46,886
His car's still here,
so where's Carl?

364
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,830
Not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

365
00:22:57,102 --> 00:22:59,187
Much less a robber. Really?

366
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:02,993
No one is here?
Not a single person? Hello?

367
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:04,125
Great.

368
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,047
Thanks for dragging us out here
for nothing.

369
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:08,927
You're sure you sensed something
was going to happen tonight?

370
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:10,505
Maybe we just missed them.

371
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,887
We could try and figure out which houses
they want to rob.

372
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:15,307
What do you do,
just randomly start knocking on doors?

373
00:23:15,475 --> 00:23:18,005
We've got better things to do,
come on, O'Hara.

374
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,649
- How often are you wrong like this?
- Not often.

375
00:23:24,774 --> 00:23:25,774
Often.

376
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:34,409
As usual, they neglected to make
one of the wise men black.

377
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:37,422
I thought everyone knew
about Balthazar.

378
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:07,637
It's Ted.

379
00:24:15,193 --> 00:24:17,152
We're not dealing with con artists,

380
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:19,536
we're dealing with murderers.

381
00:24:23,608 --> 00:24:25,593
Thank you for coming, Mr. Spencer.

382
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:29,797
Now that this has become a murder case,
we're amping up the investigation.

383
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:32,286
As you can imagine,
the city wants people to feel safe

384
00:24:32,411 --> 00:24:34,872
- this holiday season.
- Carl's in custody since this morning.

385
00:24:34,997 --> 00:24:37,889
Brittany's in the conference room.
So far we haven't found anything

386
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:40,407
to link Carl to the murder.
Technically, we can only charge him

387
00:24:40,532 --> 00:24:43,353
with conspiracy to commit burglary.
But we're willing to recommend

388
00:24:43,522 --> 00:24:45,939
that the D.A. cut a deal
if he cooperates in the murder case.

389
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:48,939
- Did he take?
- He says he'll only talk to you guys.

390
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,723
So I need to know
what you can get out of him.

391
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:53,978
Let's close
the book on this one, pronto.

392
00:24:58,068 --> 00:24:59,162
I admit it.

393
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:03,074
The Santa job was just a long con
to rob some people, okay?

394
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:07,199
But you got to believe me,
I could never have killed Ted.

395
00:25:07,324 --> 00:25:08,324
I know.

396
00:25:09,255 --> 00:25:10,840
Ted was your inside man.

397
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:14,995
I kept that from the police.

398
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:18,500
Ted and I were partners
for a long time.

399
00:25:18,824 --> 00:25:21,698
We scammed people all up and down
the coast. But we were just con men.

400
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:24,906
We never physically hurt anybody.
That wasn't our thing.

401
00:25:27,731 --> 00:25:28,741
Listen,

402
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:31,275
whoever it was that killed Ted...

403
00:25:31,702 --> 00:25:35,113
might be coming after me next.
Or even worse after Brittany.

404
00:25:35,756 --> 00:25:37,857
I don't trust the cops
to protect us.

405
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,535
- You got to stop them.
- How can we believe anything you say?

406
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:44,496
Fool us once, shame on you.
Fool us twice, shame on us.

407
00:25:44,665 --> 00:25:45,665
Fool us thrice

408
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:48,145
makes an ass out of "u" and "me".

409
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:50,189
- We're parted?
- That's a fool and his money.

410
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:52,130
- What a fool believes?
- Look!

411
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:55,382
If they kill me, they're just gonna
throw Brittany back in the system.

412
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:58,831
Now she's a tough little girl, but she's
already been through a lot, all right?

413
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:01,315
- And I'm all she's got.
- Sorry, man.

414
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:04,343
We don't trust you
as far as Gus can throw you.

415
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:11,627
Now we know
where Brittany got this little trick.

416
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:18,717
Dude, I think he's really crying.

417
00:26:20,534 --> 00:26:23,381
You know I can't handle it
when a grown man cries.

418
00:26:24,288 --> 00:26:26,539
- I'm a sympathetic crier.
- What?

419
00:26:34,165 --> 00:26:35,757
Okay, fine. Fine.

420
00:26:36,473 --> 00:26:39,694
We'll see what we can do. But you have
to promise to cooperate fully.

421
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:42,679
Otherwise we'll have you dragged right
back in here for this Christmas con.

422
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:43,890
Deal, thank you.

423
00:26:44,843 --> 00:26:45,843
Stop it.

424
00:26:46,817 --> 00:26:49,352
Do you know who may have wanted
to hurt you or Ted?

425
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:51,122
We might have

426
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:54,650
- kind of owed someone a little money.
- How about you be more specific?

427
00:26:55,007 --> 00:26:57,779
We were into our bookie for 10 grand.
That's why we're gonna do the robberies.

428
00:26:57,947 --> 00:26:59,905
Do you know
where we can find this bookie?

429
00:27:00,158 --> 00:27:01,158
Frank...

430
00:27:01,577 --> 00:27:02,927
works at two bars.

431
00:27:04,035 --> 00:27:06,162
O'Neils and The Wild Ox.

432
00:27:06,503 --> 00:27:07,513
Sweet.

433
00:27:10,271 --> 00:27:13,638
We'll have to split up.
You in the mood for hepatis A or C?

434
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:21,072
Excuse me, where's Frank?

435
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:38,436
All right,

436
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:41,879
get me 10 on "do not resuscitate"
in the fifth race. I don't have any cash

437
00:27:42,004 --> 00:27:45,165
but give me your paypal account
and I'll make a secure deposit online.

438
00:27:46,085 --> 00:27:48,931
- Some kind of joke?
- Maybe I should introduce myself.

439
00:27:49,056 --> 00:27:50,831
Shawn Spencer, psychic detective.

440
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:55,362
I'm here to talk to you about a couple
of your customers, namely, Carl

441
00:27:55,664 --> 00:27:56,764
and Ted.

442
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:59,965
I hope it's about those two bums
paying me the money they owe me.

443
00:28:00,134 --> 00:28:02,094
It's going to be tough
for Ted to pay you back.

444
00:28:02,219 --> 00:28:04,220
Seeing as how he's dead
and everything.

445
00:28:04,673 --> 00:28:07,175
- When did this happen?
- Last night.

446
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,017
As if you didn't already know.
Come on, I know the game.

447
00:28:10,553 --> 00:28:12,853
Somebody loses big,
they can't come up with the cash,

448
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:15,606
you got to send a little message.
Isn't that the code?

449
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:17,649
There's a bigger code than that.

450
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,303
Dead men don't pay back debts.

451
00:28:20,428 --> 00:28:21,597
Injured men do.

452
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,566
So I'm not your guy.
Besides...

453
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:28,350
There's a bar room with witnesses that
can vouch for my whereabouts last night.

454
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:29,965
Now,

455
00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:32,333
if you'll excuse me.

456
00:28:32,618 --> 00:28:35,356
- A paying customer has just arrived.
- Fine.

457
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:38,459
That's weird.

458
00:28:41,823 --> 00:28:42,823
Mrs. G?

459
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:47,184
What in the world are you doing here?
Do you know what this guy does?

460
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,060
This is so embarrassing.

461
00:28:51,115 --> 00:28:53,727
I've recently made the first

462
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:55,771
and the only bet in my life.

463
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,732
But you're Gus' mom,
for goodness sakes.

464
00:28:58,901 --> 00:29:00,339
I know, I know.

465
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:04,196
And normally gambling isn't something
that I would approve of,

466
00:29:04,364 --> 00:29:06,813
but Susan in accounting
has this cousin, Jeff,

467
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:10,395
nice guy, he knows someone
who knows someone who knows Frank.

468
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:14,664
- I already told you this, Frank.
- I wasn't listening.

469
00:29:15,377 --> 00:29:18,255
Anyway,
it all seemed like fate at the time.

470
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,608
Until I lost.

471
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,091
I felt terrible.
And I learned a valuable lesson

472
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:25,718
about the perils of gambling.

473
00:29:26,288 --> 00:29:27,932
Long story short, I've...

474
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:31,114
I lost my Christmas money.

475
00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:41,025
You have to promise not to tell
my husband.

476
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,880
I don't want him to know
about my secret vice.

477
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:44,861
Mrs. G...

478
00:29:45,072 --> 00:29:47,774
First of all,
one time is not a vice.

479
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:51,035
It was a momentary lapse in judgment.
Maybe a "Jones."

480
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:55,342
Secondly, I'm psychically detecting that
Mr. Guster will not be angry with you

481
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:57,632
for keeping a secret
from the family.

482
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,543
He'll understand.

483
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,429
What are you guys doing up?
It's barely light outside.

484
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:11,764
Have a seat, dear.

485
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:16,118
Christmas at my house never starts
'til after the football game.

486
00:30:16,243 --> 00:30:18,228
Well, you're just
in time to open presents.

487
00:30:20,815 --> 00:30:22,775
Gee, I wonder if santa
put money in our stockings

488
00:30:22,943 --> 00:30:24,816
even though he knows
we don't need it.

489
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:29,740
Where's my Christmas money?
I was looking forward to that.

490
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:32,583
I thought you had this handled.
With me working the night shift,

491
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,828
- I didn't have time...
- I have been cooking,

492
00:30:34,996 --> 00:30:37,421
cleaning, getting the house ready,
I've been swamped.

493
00:30:40,907 --> 00:30:42,233
I'm not gonna lie.

494
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:44,671
Honey, I made a horrible mistake.

495
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:48,118
I know how you feel about gambling.
There's no place for it in our house,

496
00:30:48,243 --> 00:30:49,051
but...

497
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:53,305
I placed a bet with a bookie
and I lost all my spending money.

498
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,159
- You know how to find a bookie?
- I am sorry.

499
00:30:58,382 --> 00:31:00,897
I am so, so sorry.
Please forgive me.

500
00:31:02,263 --> 00:31:04,077
Winnie guster placed a bet.

501
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:15,202
Oh honey, of course we forgive you.

502
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:16,870
Come here.

503
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:22,493
In fact,

504
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,713
you've inspired me to come clean
about something, too.

505
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:30,239
I...

506
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:33,762
I got laid off of my job
a month ago.

507
00:31:35,472 --> 00:31:37,641
Before you all start worrying,
it's okay.

508
00:31:37,902 --> 00:31:40,310
I've already got a couple of call backs
for some interviews.

509
00:31:40,878 --> 00:31:43,488
I just couldn't bring myself
to admit it to you guys.

510
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:45,454
Daddy.

511
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:47,484
You know you could've come to us.

512
00:31:47,718 --> 00:31:50,891
Yeah, I mean... layoffs are
common in this economy, we understand.

513
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:53,734
Oh sweetheart, you'll always be
a good provider.

514
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:00,414
Hey you, down there.

515
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,375
You deserve some of this.

516
00:32:05,564 --> 00:32:08,883
It was Shawn who helped me realize
that I could trust you with the truth.

517
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:12,259
Yes, he was there when I needed
him, too. Come on up here, boy.

518
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:17,059
Group hug.

519
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,130
Group hug.

520
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:24,312
I have something to confess, too.
Well actually, Shawn and I do.

521
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:26,481
- No, we don't.
- Yes, we do.

522
00:32:29,376 --> 00:32:33,029
We had a romantic tryst ten years ago.
Just a little something something.

523
00:32:34,177 --> 00:32:36,840
But with everyone's blessing,
we would like

524
00:32:37,578 --> 00:32:39,035
to pick up where we left off.

525
00:32:39,203 --> 00:32:42,156
- You fooled around with my sister?
- Please don't say "fooled around"

526
00:32:42,281 --> 00:32:43,957
that makes it sound so dirty.

527
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:46,259
One time ten years ago,
you were off at college.

528
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:48,920
Just because I'm not here,
doesn't make her not my sister.

529
00:32:49,088 --> 00:32:50,647
Or our baby girl.

530
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:53,717
Point of information:
I'm not a baby.

531
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:59,472
What happened to all the love
and forgiveness from just a second ago?

532
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:02,692
My mistake wasn't this bad.

533
00:33:03,307 --> 00:33:04,368
Wait a minute...

534
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:08,398
are you saying that my mistake was worse
than yours? 'cause yours was worse.

535
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:11,109
- Excuse me, I have a job.
- I knew it!

536
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,652
I knew it was coming.

537
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:15,256
Who loses a job after 35 years?

538
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:17,864
You see? That's why you lost
all your little money.

539
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,701
God don't like ugly.

540
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:26,227
No he didn't.

541
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,266
Oh, no he did not.

542
00:33:30,637 --> 00:33:33,043
Wait a second.
I'm the one that should be upset here.

543
00:33:33,168 --> 00:33:35,050
- Everyone in here was lying to me.
- Grow up!

544
00:33:35,674 --> 00:33:38,547
I can't see who I want
because you can't handle it.

545
00:33:39,055 --> 00:33:40,805
You fooled around
with my best friend.

546
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:43,992
You'll do whatever you can just to be
the center of attention won't you?

547
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:45,894
- Forehead.
- Ears.

548
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,580
What?

549
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:53,443
- I'm so sorry...
- Goodbye, Shawn.

550
00:33:58,781 --> 00:34:00,292
Yeah, yeah, shrimp.
I got it.

551
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:02,227
- I'm coming.
- Dad, merry Christmas?

552
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:04,415
I thought you were staying over
at the Gusters.

553
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,383
Yeah, well I kind of, sort of

554
00:34:06,871 --> 00:34:10,376
- ruined Christmas at that house.
- What'd you do this time?

555
00:34:12,945 --> 00:34:15,548
Gus' sister and I sort of hooked up
a while back,

556
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:19,886
and for some unknown reason,
she announced it to the whole family.

557
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:21,686
And now Gus is pissed.
And he's

558
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,389
kicking people out.

559
00:34:23,557 --> 00:34:25,415
Fooling around
with your best friend's sister

560
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,435
certainly wasn't
your most brilliant idea.

561
00:34:27,603 --> 00:34:29,824
No, that was the toaster alarm
I invented in the 3rd grade,

562
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:32,649
that woke you up by smacking you
in the face with a waffle.

563
00:34:33,442 --> 00:34:35,883
- I think I peaked too soon.
- Look shawn,

564
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,819
of course Gus is going to overreact.

565
00:34:37,944 --> 00:34:40,286
He's more than just your friend,
he's your partner.

566
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,977
There's a kind of trust there.

567
00:34:42,102 --> 00:34:44,590
When you find out that you've been
lied to by your partner,

568
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:46,314
you get angry.

569
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,456
I saw it on the force all the time.

570
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:52,794
<i>We scammed people all up
and down the coast.</i>

571
00:34:54,474 --> 00:34:55,641
Dad, that's it.

572
00:34:56,215 --> 00:34:58,883
That's it! I bet Carl and Ted
have another partner.

573
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:01,642
What? Carl and ted?
How many relatives do the Gusters have?

574
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,910
I got to go, I have a break
in the case.

575
00:35:05,515 --> 00:35:07,345
- Merry Christmas.
- Where's the shrimp?

576
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:12,922
I'm sorry for taking you away
from your family on Christmas, Jules.

577
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:13,940
It's fine.

578
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:16,352
Where's Gus?

579
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,098
We had a fight.

580
00:35:18,571 --> 00:35:20,071
He totally overreacted.

581
00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:23,562
Back in the day, his sister and I
had this teenie, weenie little...

582
00:35:24,649 --> 00:35:25,700
fling.

583
00:35:26,814 --> 00:35:28,955
You're going to take his side.
I can't believe this.

584
00:35:29,123 --> 00:35:30,790
I'm just saying it's inappropriate.

585
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:33,418
- It was way before I knew you.
- Why would that matter?

586
00:35:33,586 --> 00:35:34,842
- It might.
- It doesn't.

587
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,254
- It could.
- It won't.

588
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:40,744
Let's carry on.

589
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,367
So I pulled all of Carl
and Ted's court records

590
00:35:43,492 --> 00:35:47,402
from across the state like you said.
Your psychic sense about them was right.

591
00:35:47,527 --> 00:35:48,651
Look at this.

592
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:51,993
Ten years ago in Fresno, Carl and Ted
turned states' evidence

593
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:53,535
in an assault and robbery case.

594
00:35:53,939 --> 00:35:56,072
They implicated someone
named Moncrief Johnson.

595
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:57,997
I knew I heard that name before,

596
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,871
but I thought it was
the black quarterback

597
00:35:59,996 --> 00:36:01,529
that replaced Harrelson in <i>Wildcats</i>.

598
00:36:01,697 --> 00:36:03,104
And then I remembered...

599
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:04,775
he was the guy

600
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:06,624
who

601
00:36:07,443 --> 00:36:09,579
was knocked unconscious
in the fight at the mall.

602
00:36:10,222 --> 00:36:12,725
- The same fight Carl was involved in.
- And guess what else?

603
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,043
He was released from the hospital
the same day that Ted's body was found.

604
00:36:17,796 --> 00:36:20,756
<i>We never physically hurt anyone.
That wasn't our thing.</i>

605
00:36:22,837 --> 00:36:24,312
I'm getting something here.

606
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:27,813
Carl and ted turned states' evidence
because he started using violence.

607
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:29,123
Which wasn't their m.o.

608
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:31,223
Moncrief wasn't a victim
in the fight.

609
00:36:31,518 --> 00:36:33,324
<i>He started it.
Carl didn't realize</i>

610
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:35,767
<i>he had gotten out of prison
and was hunting him down.</i>

611
00:36:36,701 --> 00:36:40,701
<i>But the krav maga expert knocked him out
before he could get to Carl.</i>

612
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,616
When Moncrief got out of the hospital,
he picked up right where he left off.

613
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:51,287
<i>Only this time,
he didn't rely on his fists.</i>

614
00:36:51,784 --> 00:36:53,998
He'll make his move
before Carl can get away again.

615
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:56,665
You call Lassie,
I have to warn Carl.

616
00:37:22,694 --> 00:37:25,529
Moncrief Johnson, you're under arrest
for the murder of Theodore Meltregger

617
00:37:25,697 --> 00:37:28,211
and the attempted murder
of Carl Wilcox.

618
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:30,451
I think you made "the naughty list."

619
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,283
Congratulations, Shawn.
We got him.

620
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:40,544
Thanks for believing me
this time, man.

621
00:37:42,278 --> 00:37:44,007
Thanks for saving my daddy.

622
00:37:52,288 --> 00:37:54,416
All right, folks.
Let's clear the area.

623
00:37:54,977 --> 00:37:57,143
All right, you guys
can come with me.

624
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:59,342
Hey, man.

625
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:02,733
Look, I'm not a parent

626
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:04,328
or an uncle.

627
00:38:04,604 --> 00:38:05,782
Or even a godfather.

628
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,238
I think children are sticky.
But look,

629
00:38:09,908 --> 00:38:13,010
one thing's for certain, and that's that
Brittany is a very smart little girl.

630
00:38:13,135 --> 00:38:14,917
But she's not going
to be little for long.

631
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:18,278
When these times are gone, she'll be out
there making her own choices.

632
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,753
Do you really think that you're teaching
her to make the right choices?

633
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,708
Please don't,

634
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:30,144
I'm a grown man.
She's right over there.

635
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:43,372
Here comes your dad.

636
00:38:44,677 --> 00:38:47,194
- Daddy.
- Come on, come on, let's go home.

637
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:04,656
What do you want?

638
00:39:06,682 --> 00:39:07,798
I feel...

639
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:09,800
Good enough for me.
Come on in.

640
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:24,640
What is going on here? When I left,
you guys were furious with each other.

641
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:26,859
We stayed that way for a while,
but we got over it.

642
00:39:27,303 --> 00:39:28,717
Like we always do.

643
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:31,385
See, it's not the first time
that we got mad

644
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,404
because one of us
did something stupid.

645
00:39:33,529 --> 00:39:34,825
And it won't be the last.

646
00:39:34,993 --> 00:39:37,775
Our rule is, you can get
as mad as you like,

647
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,497
as long as you spend the same amount
of energy working it out after.

648
00:39:40,665 --> 00:39:42,757
It took a lot of energy to work out

649
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:45,388
how we felt about the secret
the two of you were keeping.

650
00:39:46,796 --> 00:39:48,579
- But they got over it.
- Then we realized,

651
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,977
you frustrated us
the way only family can, so

652
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:52,652
we decided to forgive you too.

653
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:55,447
- Thanks, man.
- Merry Christmas.

654
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:00,460
And as far as your sleeping
arrangements, well,

655
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:04,021
you don't have to go home. But you
got to get the hell up out of here.

656
00:40:04,189 --> 00:40:06,245
- I hear that.
- Believe that.

657
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,194
- Merry Christmas, though.
- Merry Christmas.

658
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,099
Just came by to drop off your gift.
What happened to your lodge buddies?

659
00:40:24,775 --> 00:40:28,138
I made the mistake of telling singleton
his wife was getting hippy.

660
00:40:28,263 --> 00:40:30,503
Just a joke,
I didn't mean anything by it.

661
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:31,996
But tempers started to flare,

662
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:34,195
and the next thing,
the room is divided into 2 camps,

663
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,677
"hippy" and "not hippy."

664
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:39,056
Needless to say, it was time for me
to send everybody's ass home.

665
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:42,413
I'm really sorry to hear that, pop.

666
00:40:42,769 --> 00:40:43,821
No worries.

667
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,526
Because we still have
our tradition to do. Right?

668
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,611
And my winning streak
is about to be extended.

669
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:01,279
Oh, my.

670
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:03,844
- Did we get each other the same...
- No.

671
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:08,656
I figured you'd pull a stunt like this.
So mine is just a decoy.

672
00:41:09,398 --> 00:41:10,693
Your real present...

673
00:41:16,298 --> 00:41:18,016
You're so predictable.

674
00:41:18,847 --> 00:41:21,681
Which is why I hid
your real present...

675
00:41:24,602 --> 00:41:26,311
Now this is just uncanny.

676
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:28,757
You better not have gotten me
the same iphone I got you.

677
00:41:28,882 --> 00:41:31,855
Don't be ridiculous.
I got you the psych

678
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:33,454
iphone

679
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,940
skin.

680
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:39,199
But silly me,
you don't have an iphone.

681
00:41:39,738 --> 00:41:41,658
So I'll just keep it for my new one.

682
00:41:43,046 --> 00:41:44,621
And my winning streak continues.

683
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:46,780
Merry Christmas.
