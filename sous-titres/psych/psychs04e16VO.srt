00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,917
<i>Last season on</i> Psych...

2
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:05,504
Mr. Yang is the most notorious killer
this city has never seen.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,006
He only resurfaces when he feels
there's a worthy opponent.

4
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:11,135
That is Mary Lightly. He's very familiar
with the patterns of our killer.

5
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:13,760
- Question regarding the {\whole }Mary thing.
- My father's name was Mary,

6
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:16,807
his father before him was named Mary,
his father before him was named Craig.

7
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:19,769
I forbid you to be a part of this.
This guy knows about you.

8
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,582
- {\He knows }About everybody you care about.
- He's got my mom.

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,998
This switch has such a light touch,
and then boom!

10
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:27,652
You're gonna rot in a cell
with four padded walls. The end.

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,570
I'm gonna write a book.
Our story.

12
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,030
- Guess I have to find a new hobby.
- Tours, racquetball.

13
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:33,492
That could work.

14
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:38,191
All right, last chance. You really want
to do this on a Friday night?

15
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:40,676
{\pos(192,220)}<i>The Little Mermaid.</i> Without Gus?

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,439
{\pos(192,220)}Apparently Gus has a strange aversion
to Rene Auberjonois.

17
00:00:44,564 --> 00:00:45,859
It's a <i>Benson</i> thing.

18
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:47,767
You really want to see this flick?

19
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:50,066
Dad, don't say "flick".

20
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:52,050
And I'm barely tickling adolescence.

21
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:55,442
- Why do you want me to grow up so fast?
- All right, I know the running time.

22
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:58,507
I'm gonna be back here
in exactly 116 minutes.

23
00:00:58,632 --> 00:00:59,632
Awesome.

24
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:03,634
Bye, Dad!

25
00:01:16,624 --> 00:01:17,493
Is that you?

26
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,330
{\}

27
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:23,014
'Scuse me.

28
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,667
Just hurry.

29
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:28,511
Just kiss the knees in a touch, guys.
Thanks.

30
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,679
You're very sweet, both of you.
Your drink. I'm...

31
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:33,300
That's my bad. I'm sorry.

32
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,968
That's just awkward.

33
00:01:36,307 --> 00:01:38,634
Where have you been?
You missed the first third of the movie.

34
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,937
Let me guess: dude has a creepy voice
and a mommy complex.

35
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:44,186
All I care about
is the shower scene.

36
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:46,849
Wait for it...

37
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,767
Did you know that Hitchcock appeared
in all of his films?

38
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:54,980
- Everyone knows that.
- But did you know

39
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:58,331
that he was also obsessed with women's
Japanese household slippers?

40
00:01:58,456 --> 00:02:00,202
Wore them everywhere, even to bed.

41
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,021
- That's not true.
- No, it's not.

42
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:03,748
It's part of a new bit
I'm working on

43
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,423
called completely random,
untrue trivia.

44
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:12,757
You guys like pie?

45
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:18,872
When I was nine years old,
my mother gave me my first haircut.

46
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,099
- Here's your milk, doll face.
- Thank you.

47
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,397
Mary, you seem disturbed.
Even more so than usual.

48
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:30,149
I'm almost afraid to ask, why don't you
tell us what's really on your mind?

49
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:32,554
I'm assuming you've read this.

50
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,121
{\}

51
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:36,029
Are you kidding?
We're in it.

52
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:38,324
If I'm not mistaken,
and I am paraphrasing here,

53
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,907
I'm introduced on page 11

54
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:42,657
as a thick-tufted boy genius
who ice skates through life

55
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:44,468
on polished blades
of snarky eloquence.

56
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:46,123
That is an exact quote.

57
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:47,708
{\Do you remember }What was I described as?

58
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,943
Laughing on the outside,
crying on the inside,

59
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:52,254
the fastidious wrinkle
on the brow of Psych.

60
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:53,783
True, but she also said

61
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:55,908
you had skin
of pure cocoa velvetiness.

62
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:58,928
She also she would like to use that skin
to make children's dolls.

63
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:00,235
I'd buy that doll.

64
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,666
The point is,
you know Yang almost as well as I do.

65
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,767
You're the only other person who would
know that none of this is possible.

66
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:09,663
Come on, Shawn, the projectionist.

67
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:11,773
We didn't get
to the drive-in till 11:26.

68
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:13,825
How would Yang have had
the time to do all that

69
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,417
and strapped your mother down
with incendiary explosives?

70
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:17,692
Look, Mary...

71
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:20,741
I know that Yang
was a big part of your life.

72
00:03:21,477 --> 00:03:25,120
But she is behind electronic gates now,
and she can't hurt anyone anymore.

73
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:28,905
Yang wasn't working alone.

74
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:38,259
- You didn't {\give}start racquetball{\ a fair shake, did you?}.
- I will not wear short pants, Shawn.

75
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,127
I think it's time for you
to go home, Mary.

76
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:42,606
I am home.

77
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,332
I live here.

78
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:46,725
- Say what?
- I never left Santa Barbara.

79
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,565
I've been here since we caught Yang.

80
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:56,609
You should have told us.

81
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:59,426
We would have gotten you
a house chilling gift.

82
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:02,199
A belated welcome to you,
and forever good-bye.

83
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:04,611
Don't go, Shawn.

84
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,186
You will regret it.

85
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,613
Good luck at the creepy arm grab awards
this year, Mary.

86
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:12,492
I think you have a real shot...

87
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:13,667
at winning.

88
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:53,998
Shawn, thanks for coming out here.

89
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:55,624
We think that this just happened,

90
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:57,666
so if there's anything
to get psychically,

91
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,315
I wanted you to take a look
while things are still fresh.

92
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,895
- What happened?
- It isn't pretty.

93
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:07,437
The victim's a caucasian female,
approximate age, mid-40s.

94
00:05:08,252 --> 00:05:11,018
Strangled, dropped here
like a sack of potatoes.

95
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:14,146
Body's still warm.

96
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:16,272
I know.

97
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,682
What's the matter? You've forget
to take your crime scene pills?

98
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,372
- Do you know this woman?
- She served us our pie.

99
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:28,869
What the hell does that mean,
She served you your pie?

100
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:45,453
What is it?

101
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,126
Psych 416
"Mr. Yin Presents"

00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,966
Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu{\pub}

103
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:27,886
{\pos(192,220)}All right, you were the last customer{\ in this place last night}.
What do you remember seeing?

104
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,395
Nothing, she brought Gus's milk,
and I never saw her again.

105
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,308
- I couldn't {\even }find her to pay the bill.
- Wait, you didn't pay the check?

106
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,194
So what happened to my $20?

107
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:38,230
I folded it into a tiny sailor's hat
for a special friend.

108
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:51,014
Here we go.

109
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:53,662
- It's Yang.
- She's in jail.

110
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,622
Indeed, this is the work of Yin.

111
00:06:57,026 --> 00:06:59,026
{\pos(192,220)}Back off, this can get sticky.

112
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,099
{\pos(192,200)}- What is that?
- Crossword puzzle.

113
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,856
{\pos(192,220)}It's from yesterday's paper.

114
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,718
{\pos(192,220)}There's two clues highlighted.
12 down and 6 across.

115
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:15,893
{\pos(192,220)}"A Good Man Is Hard to blank.

116
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,728
- "Blank, Myself, and I."
- I got it!

117
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,981
{\pos(192,220)}A Good Man Is Hard to Find.

118
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:23,512
{\pos(192,220)}Me, Myself, and I.

119
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:25,863
{\pos(192,220)}The answer is "find me".

120
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:29,907
{\pos(192,220)}I think that bailiff from <i>Night Court</i>
is spot-on.

121
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:33,494
- Perfect, we can start by...
- No, Jules, we don't start, period.

122
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:36,327
{\pos(192,200)}You guys want another crime scene?
You want another dead body?

123
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:37,795
{\pos(192,200)}Go ahead, engage.

124
00:07:38,097 --> 00:07:39,874
But we can't play this game again.

125
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:43,504
{\pos(192,220)}I wish I had the luxury not to follow
a lead in a murder investigation.

126
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,253
{\pos(192,220)}Fine, you do what you have to do.

127
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:47,541
{\pos(192,220)}Gus and I are going
straight to the source.

128
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:50,219
{\pos(192,220)}You coming or what?

129
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,140
Solitary confinement
in a mental institution?

130
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,605
Feels redundant.

131
00:07:56,828 --> 00:07:59,355
{\pos(192,220)}- I smell crazy.
- I crave sweet, sweet marshmallows.

132
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,295
{\pos(192,220)}- And why are we wearing these?
- It's a preventative measure.

133
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,233
{\pos(192,220)}She gets overly stimulated by color.

134
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:06,054
What about my face?

135
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,704
I knew you'd come.

136
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,913
She's cute, right?

137
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,360
{\pos(192,220)}I got the googley eyes for her,
but she's playing hard to get.

138
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,926
{\pos(192,220)}I can't stand it any more.
What did you think of the book?

139
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,254
Honestly?

140
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,988
I thought Bruce Campbell's
was better.

141
00:08:36,113 --> 00:08:37,928
We're here to ask you one,
simple question.

142
00:08:38,053 --> 00:08:40,769
The answer is yes, Shawn,
they do allow conjugal visits.

143
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:42,980
But I think we'd have
to get married first.

144
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:46,400
- I am a fully-ordained minister.
- {\That's }The most disgusting thing I've {\ever }heard.

145
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:49,528
Mary here seems to think
that you are not the sole mastermind

146
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:51,537
behind this nasty venture.

147
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,323
I don't think, Shawn, I know.

148
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:55,506
Do you, Mary, quite contrary?

149
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:00,307
Do you now?

150
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:10,716
I think we can help each other out.

151
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,896
- This isn't <i>Silence of the lambs</i>.
- It's totally <i>Silence of the lambs</i>.

152
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,096
- That makes you Frankie Faison.
- I know.

153
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,641
We're gonna catch this sicko{\ with or without you}.
{\I thought }I'd give you one shot at redemption.

154
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,373
Make no mistake:
you're going to hell either way.

155
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:24,526
Speak now, or we're out of here.

156
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:28,128
See you.

157
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:37,016
I never said
I didn't have a dance partner.

158
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:42,492
So there really is a Yin
to her Yang.

159
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,599
If you think I'm sick,

160
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:46,947
you ain't seen nothin' yet.

161
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:51,089
- What are we doing here?
- Retracing our steps.

162
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:54,910
We were here {\last night }for the Hitchcock festival.
It was a triple feature.

163
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:57,092
Guster, I don't care
how many movies you saw.

164
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:59,181
Spencer, what the hell are we doing?

165
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:08,564
<i>There's two clues highlighted.
12 down, 6 across.</i>

166
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:10,442
12 down.

167
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,012
6 across.

168
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:16,823
He was here!

169
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:19,251
12 down, 6 across.

170
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,411
He was sitting right there.

171
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,477
I think we were in the same row.

172
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:26,199
Then you must have seen him.
What did he look like?

173
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:29,169
<i>Just hurry.
You're very sweet, both of you.</i>

174
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,213
<i>Your drink.
I'm... that's my bad.</i>

175
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,966
- I don't know.
- There's something here.

176
00:10:35,322 --> 00:10:38,011
"Oh, Shawn,
don't cry over spilled soda.

177
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,791
"But, tsk tsk, you were 20 minutes late,
so now you'll have to play catch-up. "

178
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,393
- You two need to go back and see Yang.
- No, she is not...

179
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,645
The puppet master anymore.
Yin is working alone.

180
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,147
What can you tell us about Yin?
What's his game?

181
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,857
There is no game.
It's the law of opposites, okay?

182
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:54,194
Yang had rules... The ticking clock,

183
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,499
the keen rhyming schemes,
nothing but order.

184
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:58,156
Yin, nothing but chaos.

185
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,674
And you can bet your sandy bottom that
as soon as you figure out the rules,

186
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,168
they'll change.

187
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,999
- Let's go to the movies!
- Seriously, not again.

188
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,876
I'm not gonna watch you act
like a court jester for a second round{\ of this nightmare}.

189
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,627
The necktie around the waitress,
that's straight out of <i>Frenzy</i>.

190
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,812
We're {\clearly }dealing in themes and motifs.
Him knowing we were here last night,

191
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:18,175
our clues are gonna be found
in Hitchcock films.

192
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,956
That's very good, Gustus.

193
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:22,925
Okay, we've got
a lot of cinema to cover.

194
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,143
Gus and I'll take {\the }<i>Cannonball</i>{\ run series}.
You take <i>Hooper</i> through <i>stroker ace</i>.

195
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,769
Those are Burt Reynolds movies.

196
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:31,928
We really have
our work cut out for us then.

197
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,191
Think, Shawn, think.

198
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,816
Try and find something.

199
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:59,314
You didn't see his face,

200
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:02,179
but you can pick up on something.

201
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,442
You can do it, Shawn.

202
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:09,202
The feet, the shoes.

203
00:12:09,691 --> 00:12:10,691
Something.

204
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:16,509
I'm cold!

205
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:18,445
And hurry up.
We don't have all night.

206
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,991
- You can do it, Shawn.
- Come on. Focus.

207
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:25,226
Think.

208
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:26,957
See something.

209
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,199
Show me your face! Look at me!

210
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:32,084
<i>Come on, Shawn, the projectionist.</i>

211
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,322
<i>We didn't get
to the drive-in till 11:26.</i>

212
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:36,670
<i>How would Yang have had the time
to do all that?</i>

213
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,475
Come on, Shawn. It's me.

214
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:46,514
It's always been me.

215
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,603
<i>I don't think
we're speaking to the mouse.</i>

216
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,187
<i>The mouse is speaking to you.</i>

217
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:55,110
<i>I don't think, Shawn.</i>

218
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:56,402
<i>I know.</i>

219
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:01,942
Look what happened to our window.

220
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:14,447
I know who Yin is.{\pub}

221
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:18,543
Mr. Spencer, this is outlandish.

222
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:21,868
- Just hear him out.
- Mary Lightly all but confessed

223
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,386
{\pos(192,240)}to Gus and I when he said {\that }he had spent
the last 13 years of his life with Yang

224
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:28,265
{\pos(192,240)}and had no idea
what he was going to do without her.

225
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:29,992
{\pos(192,240)}Mr. Spencer, I have to ask:

226
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:32,982
{\pos(192,240)}why are you just now receiving
these psychic signals?

227
00:13:33,107 --> 00:13:35,355
Why didn't you tag Mary as a suspect
the last time around?

228
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,649
He did. It was the first thing
he said when he saw him.

229
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:41,058
- He was being flippant and jackassy.
- Our track record speaks for itself.

230
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:43,579
{\pos(192,240)}We can either do this together,
or we can follow you around

231
00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:45,629
{\pos(192,240)}and conduct our own investigation.

232
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:50,912
{\pos(192,240)}All right, Mr. Spencer.
But you're on a very short leash.

233
00:13:51,841 --> 00:13:53,415
How do you suggest that we proceed?

234
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,293
Keeping in mind, of course,
we haven't a shred of physical evidence.

235
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:59,546
- We do nothing.
- Nothing? How seinfeldian.

236
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:03,152
Chief, we let him hang himself.
We keep him close, we play along.

237
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:04,968
We catch him red-handed.

238
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,743
I got Yin's next clue.
I found it on my doorstep,

239
00:14:17,868 --> 00:14:20,599
along with a can of matizallego sarnes
in olive oil.

240
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:22,915
It took ever ounce of willpower I had
not to open them up.

241
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,696
Sweet. Sock it to us.

242
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:27,842
"Take 39 steps by 12:05.

243
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,159
"Wait for it.

244
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:31,536
"Coordinates north by Northwest.

245
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:34,498
- "Make a wish."
- Wait for what? More Hitchcock.

246
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,089
No, it's just a motif.
Try to think through it, chief.

247
00:14:37,425 --> 00:14:40,275
- He's showing off.
- We're all ears, Lightly.

248
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,156
You really are all ears, Carlton.

249
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:44,381
Spectacular.

250
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:49,392
I've delivered this clue, and I suggest
that we all think about it analytically.

251
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,804
Northwest, northwest.
Northwest mall, northwest air.

252
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:54,309
Northwest... Park and picnic.

253
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,437
That's it. I play dominoes
with some Jamaicans there on Sundays.

254
00:14:57,849 --> 00:15:00,607
There's a set of stairs that leads up
to a penny fountain. "Make a wish."

255
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,485
We have less than a half hour.
Mr. Lightly, {\you ride }with my detectives.

256
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:06,104
- Let's go!
- We'll be right behind you!

257
00:15:07,437 --> 00:15:09,416
Come on, we're taking a detour.

258
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,954
We're close.
His house should be right here.

259
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:19,228
That's it.
That's the address.

260
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:20,403
Damn, Mary.

261
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:23,417
I think Mary would want you
to have a can or two.

262
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:24,792
Shut up, Shawn.

263
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,887
Dude, it's Ben!

264
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:35,183
- He wasn't kidding.
- That hat belongs in my wallet.

265
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:38,049
What's with all the numbers?

266
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:42,106
It's Pi.

267
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,151
Don't be Topher Grace running
on the beach at the end of <i>Good Company</i>.

268
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,798
The value of Pi, Shawn,
as in mathematics.

269
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:49,296
Right, with the...

270
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:51,623
Do we like Pi, he asks.

271
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:53,159
This dude has problems.

272
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:08,732
Quick.

273
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,670
Arrest that fat kid.

274
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:13,555
There's no time.

275
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:15,809
No, there's less than a minute.

276
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,184
Damn it, Mary, come on!
What are you wearing, ankle weights?

277
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,311
Of course I am!

278
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:21,146
I've got a thigh spasm!

279
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,231
It burns so deep, you guys!

280
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,918
Go on without me!

281
00:16:28,562 --> 00:16:30,662
- Damn it.
- What do you think?

282
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:32,157
Just come on, Mary!

283
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,243
Dude, a ticket stub.

284
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,559
He was definitely
at the movie theater.

285
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:37,784
He sure was.

286
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:44,715
Oh, hell, no.

287
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:57,745
36, 37, 38, 39.

288
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:00,904
It's 12:05 on the dot.

289
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:03,686
What the hell are we supposed
to be looking for?

290
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,192
Wait.

291
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,318
I think I have something.

292
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,529
That's the north line.
"North by northwest."

293
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:12,530
That's him!

294
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,940
Where the hell is Mary?

295
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:18,767
Son of a bitch!

296
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:21,646
What is it?

297
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:25,184
"It's time we met in the flesh,
don't you think?"

298
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:27,754
It's his next move.
He's just working out the wording.

299
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,322
"736 la porte avenue,
industrial lane.

300
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:31,674
"Curtain's at 9 P.M.

301
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:32,994
"Come alone."

302
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:35,089
Who is it for?

303
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:37,308
His next victim.

304
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,684
McNab, do not tell me that!

305
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,609
Someone on that bus must
have seen something.

306
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,950
What happened? Where were you?

307
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:49,109
- Cut the crap, Mary! Start talking!
- Didn't you see at the bus stop?

308
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,327
It was him!

309
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,640
I tried to stop him, I tried,
but it was too late.

310
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:55,126
He was wearing a...
very stylish fedora.

311
00:17:55,251 --> 00:17:58,034
We know. We got off on the next stop.
We must have missed him {\by a matter of}for few seconds.

312
00:17:58,309 --> 00:17:59,404
Of course you did.

313
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,329
He knew exactly
how much time it would take.

314
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,248
He probably rehearsed it 100 times.

315
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,000
He totally manhandled me.

316
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:08,405
I dropped my shoe.

317
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,596
Spencer where the hell are you?

318
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:13,383
Yeah, thanks for nothing.

319
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,051
Is Shawn okay?

320
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,970
He's fine. His tire blew.
Get in the car.

321
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:27,914
Shawn, are you sure
this is where we're supposed to be?

322
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,775
Absolutely. This is one of the strongest
visions I've had in years.

323
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,485
<i>"736 la porte avenue,
industrial lane."</i>

324
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,751
I saw this place, I saw Mary's face,

325
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:37,176
I saw his watch.

326
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:43,045
Look at that.

327
00:18:50,702 --> 00:18:52,014
It's show time.

328
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:53,764
Let's bag this degenerate.

329
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:55,239
You two stay put.

330
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:01,498
Of course it's locked.
I'm gonna take the east exit.

331
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,699
Copy that. I'll head around back.
Take it from behind.

332
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:05,830
Let's try and keep this P.G. rated.

333
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:07,712
Damn it,
I told you to stay in the car.

334
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:09,580
He's probably
keeping an eye on that door.

335
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:12,458
We know-we're gonna walk the perimeter.
Go back to the car.

336
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,521
This door opens, or you see anything
that doesn't look right, honk the horn.

337
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:16,646
Go, now!

338
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:28,762
Shawn, what are you doing?

339
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,790
We're out of here.

340
00:19:45,106 --> 00:19:46,406
We're locked in.

341
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:49,354
- What are we looking at?
- I don't care.

342
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:52,862
<i>Come out, come out,
wherever you are.</i>

343
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:57,004
What are you up to, Mary?

344
00:20:04,964 --> 00:20:07,372
Dude, I'm getting
serious deja vu right now.

345
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:09,979
Wait a minute.

346
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,960
Oh, my gosh.

347
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,472
He's gonna shoot somebody, Shawn.
He has a gun.

348
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,262
This is <i>Psycho</i>! We were wrong!
Mary is the victim.

349
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,473
Get out of here!

350
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,814
There's gotta be
a way out of this room!

351
00:20:52,357 --> 00:20:53,607
I'm sorry, Gus.

352
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,461
The clue was meant for him.

353
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,266
{\I don't understand.}What about the notebook?

354
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:59,257
All recreations.
Not first drafts!

355
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,758
I should...

356
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,276
I should have told you guys, but...

357
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:05,138
I wanted to be heroic.

358
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:07,807
This is detective O'Hara.
We need a IM...

359
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:10,385
With a flare gun?

360
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,380
I was really counting on
the element of surprise.

361
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:14,679
There...

362
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,859
- What the hell happened?
- There! He was right there!

363
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:27,619
- Could you take care of Ben?
- You hang on. There's help on the way.

364
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,250
Do you think they have
racquetball in heaven?

365
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:37,737
I know they do.{\pub}

366
00:21:58,677 --> 00:22:02,110
{\pos(192,240)}You're interrupting my exercise time{\, Shawn}.
I only get 45 minutes a week.

367
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,864
{\pos(192,240)}Aside from shock treatments,
this is all I have to look forward to.

368
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,234
That and hell.

369
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:12,371
- Roll it back, Reginald!
- Who{\ the hell} is she talking to?

370
00:22:12,768 --> 00:22:15,480
Look, your partner
wore ankle weights to throw me off.

371
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:17,042
I was wrong about Mary.

372
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,212
I know.

373
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,003
Such a shame.

374
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:24,372
My lady guard friend told me.
Please don't beat yourself up, Shawn.

375
00:22:24,497 --> 00:22:27,457
The guy creeped me out.
This was an honest mistake.

376
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:29,847
We need your help.

377
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,059
Little brooding brown one.

378
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,310
I've already given you all the help
you need to catch Yin.

379
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,929
How? You just seem bat s.
crazy to me.

380
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,461
Never... judge a book by its cover.

381
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:43,186
No matter how sexy
that picture might be.

382
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:52,023
- Give me the book.
- Shawn, I read{\ this book} it cover to cover.

383
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:53,767
I've pored over it.

384
00:22:57,468 --> 00:22:58,802
Cover to cover.

385
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:00,539
What?

386
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:06,803
Look{\ at that}.

387
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:10,220
Nice. She drew a self-portrait
just for you. But what does it mean?

388
00:23:12,872 --> 00:23:13,872
Chief...

389
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:17,533
Yin sent another clue.

390
00:23:19,626 --> 00:23:21,941
We have the address.
The time will be 9:00 pm.

391
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:25,255
He wants you all to show up there,
where he has created his own movie set.

392
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,822
- I'm done watching movies{\, chief}.
- Exactly, detective.

393
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,657
You now, are the movie.

394
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:33,452
He's cast you all as archetypal
characters from Hitchcock's canon.

395
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:37,033
There will be clues that lead you
to catch him, based on{\ the plots of} those films.

396
00:23:37,158 --> 00:23:39,833
You serious about this? We're{\ just} supposed
to play dress-up all night?

397
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,191
We will do whatever it takes,
detective.

398
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:44,417
He is giving us
an opportunity to catch him

399
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:45,757
before he kills again.

400
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:49,247
Now, I'm not sending you
in there like sitting ducks.

401
00:23:49,372 --> 00:23:50,901
He{\'s made it very clear that you are} wants you to come alone.

402
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:53,269
But the only way
that this is going to work

403
00:23:53,394 --> 00:23:56,016
is if I set up a team on the outside
and cover the perimeter.

404
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,143
- Snipers?
- You bet your ass.

405
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:01,438
Karen... I got your message.
What can I do?

406
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:04,900
He's called you out{\, henry}.
You have a history with him as well.

407
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:08,354
- Sean Connery?
- Dad, you can say no.

408
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:12,145
{\Shawn, }The last time{\ this happened,} you put your life
on the line, we almost lost your mother.

409
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,868
I'm gonna be right by your side, son.
End of discussion.

410
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:17,171
All right, people.

411
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:19,068
This ends tonight.

412
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:25,364
All right, chief, no sign of{\ human} movement.
We're gonna gain a better vantage point.

413
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:28,469
<i>Okay, proceed, but keep me posted
as to your coordinates,</i>

414
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:31,038
<i>and make sure
that everyone is tuned in.</i>

415
00:24:31,163 --> 00:24:34,047
Snipers are in place
and will go at my ready.

416
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,674
<i>So no false alarms.</i>

417
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:41,337
Wait a minute.
I think that's meant for me.

418
00:24:41,462 --> 00:24:44,189
That scene from <i>The Birds</i>,
Tippi Hedren's attacked in the car.

419
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,569
What are you talking about{\,Lassiter}?
Didn't you see <i>Marnie</i>?

420
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,052
Half that movie was me
and Tippi driving around{\ in a car}.

421
00:24:49,177 --> 00:24:50,370
That clue is all me.

422
00:24:50,495 --> 00:24:52,613
You do realize you're not
{\actually }Sean Connery{\, right}?

423
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:54,992
Oh, I'm sorry.
{\No, }I got lost for a moment there,

424
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,675
because I literally thought
I was talking to Rod Taylor.

425
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,621
- Who's Rod Taylor?
- I am!

426
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,290
{\Look, stop. }We can't be sure.
You should both go and check it out.

427
00:25:15,454 --> 00:25:16,654
"Need a ride?"

428
00:25:19,757 --> 00:25:20,807
It's clear.

429
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:28,359
- {\All right, }We're in the vehicle.
- <i>Watch yourself.</i>

430
00:25:35,682 --> 00:25:36,783
{\Well, }Look at that.

431
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,746
That's a wheelchair.
Up in that window there.

432
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:46,887
Looks like that's my clue.

433
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:48,952
Be careful.

434
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,664
Canada lee? Lifeboat?

435
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:55,261
Do you see any water{\ around here}?
There wasn't even a puddle.

436
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:57,877
Yeah, I don't know
how it fit into this either.

437
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:04,664
Maybe it is just a prop.

438
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:07,729
There's no ignition,
not even a place for a key.

439
00:26:19,984 --> 00:26:21,618
<i>This place is creepy.</i>

440
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,815
I'm almost at the door.

441
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:28,001
Open it and then run away.

442
00:26:34,123 --> 00:26:36,176
It's locked.
Yin in screwing with us.

443
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:37,535
<i>What are you seeing?</i>

444
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,173
Gus, it's rear window. I can see
all of you. I can see everything.

445
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:43,016
Question is, what actually matters?

446
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,148
- That's Ernie's bar from <i>Vertigo</i>!
- Kim Novak.

447
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:51,399
<i>This is me{\, Shawn}.</i>

448
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,267
I'll signal{\ everyone} if there's anything.

449
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:55,576
<i>Proceed with caution, detective.</i>

450
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:58,323
We're in a tunnel{\ now}.
How the hell's he doing this?

451
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:08,250
What is... What is that?

452
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,717
- What are you doing in here?
- We can't see you{\ in here}.

453
00:27:25,842 --> 00:27:27,644
That music is playing so loud
we can't hear{\ anything}.

454
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,264
Stay where you are.

455
00:27:29,662 --> 00:27:30,814
I have a clue.

456
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,968
"Draught us a couple cold ones,
and let's make a toast

457
00:27:34,093 --> 00:27:36,194
"to you falling head
over heels for me."

458
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,367
{\Gus... }Relax. It's why we're here.

459
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,672
I'm going to do this.

460
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,080
Talk to me. Talk to me, Gus!

461
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,348
Cover your eyes!
I'm gonna shoot out the window!

462
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,044
O'Hara, somebody, come in.
What happened?

463
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:32,168
- Car was a trap! We lost contact.
- Something happened in the bar!

464
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,099
I know this is hard.

465
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:01,697
We're ready to take the call{\ when it comes in}.
There's nothing more we can do.

466
00:29:02,268 --> 00:29:03,468
It's my fault.

467
00:29:03,685 --> 00:29:05,762
Dammit, Spencer,
this is not your fault.

468
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:08,244
Detective O'Hara
was my responsibility.

469
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,373
The tunnel wasn't on {\any of the }schematics,

470
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,833
the son of a bitch knew it.
{\There's no way }We couldn't{\ have} know{\n}.

471
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:14,898
Unless you're a psychic.

472
00:29:17,394 --> 00:29:20,170
I{\ just} spoke with your mother.
I wanted her to know that you were safe.

473
00:29:20,295 --> 00:29:21,299
She's fine.

474
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,876
She's at a hotel in New York
at a conference.

475
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:25,540
I told her to stay put.

476
00:29:27,445 --> 00:29:28,973
Doesn't Abigail get in tonight?

477
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:34,569
What time is it?

478
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,978
- It's almost 1:00.
- Her flight gets in in half an hour.

479
00:29:38,103 --> 00:29:40,110
We can't afford to let you go.

480
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,821
{\Shawn, }What happens if a call comes in
and we need to {\be somewhere halfway across}cross

481
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,073
- the city in 11 minutes?
- I have to pick her up.

482
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:48,284
Don't worry. We'll send someone
to get her. Someone she knows.

483
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,512
How was Uganda?

484
00:29:56,637 --> 00:29:59,892
It was rich, compelling, a must-see.
What is this about, Buzz?

485
00:30:00,017 --> 00:30:02,259
Can't{\ really} say.
I'm{\ just} here to{\ make sure} get you home safe{\ly}.

486
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,909
Why wouldn't I be safe?

487
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:06,130
This is ridiculous,
and I am beyond jetlagged.

488
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:08,255
Just tell me what is going on.

489
00:30:08,536 --> 00:30:09,936
Please, Ms. Lytar.

490
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,250
Just following my orders.

491
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:15,499
"Ms. Lytar"?

492
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Really?

493
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,115
What are you doing?

494
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:30,201
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

495
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:35,079
Somebody help me!

496
00:30:41,451 --> 00:30:44,091
It's Abigail. Hey, Abs, sorry I couldn't
pick you up myself.

497
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:47,093
<i>Hello, Shawn.
I have good news and bad news.</i>

498
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,890
<i>The good news is that our femme fatale
is still very much alive.</i>

499
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:54,226
<i>The bad news, for you anyway,</i>

500
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:57,351
<i>is that I have now met
the girl next door.</i>

501
00:30:57,476 --> 00:31:00,576
<i>I understand your predicament.
They're both so you.</i>

502
00:31:01,374 --> 00:31:03,861
<i>But we can't have our cake
and eat it too.</i>

503
00:31:04,168 --> 00:31:06,113
<i>So I'm doing you a favor here</i>

504
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:08,031
<i>by forcing you to choose.</i>

505
00:31:08,296 --> 00:31:09,296
Choose?

506
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,052
<i>Who do you care about more?</i>

507
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,449
Because you can't save them both.{\pub}

508
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:29,362
McNab is okay.

509
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,088
{\pos(192,240)}He didn't get a look at Yin.

510
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,534
{\pos(192,240)}You want something
from the snack machine?

511
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,414
{\pos(192,240)}You know, they have bugles.

512
00:31:46,298 --> 00:31:47,362
This is it!

513
00:31:48,486 --> 00:31:49,536
This is it!

514
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,260
What is the clue?

515
00:31:54,385 --> 00:31:55,685
What's the clue?

516
00:31:56,808 --> 00:31:58,582
{\pos(192,240)}<i>I'll drop by half past 4:00.</i>

517
00:31:59,562 --> 00:32:01,179
My hands are on my face.

518
00:32:01,485 --> 00:32:03,503
Please come quick,
or this could be messy.

519
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,743
<i>Shawn, you can still save Abigail...</i>

520
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:23,990
"Hands on my face." It's a clock.

521
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:27,402
- Half past four, this could get messy.
- "I'll drop by."

522
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,487
She's Kim Novak in <i>Vertigo</i>.

523
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,807
"I'll... drop by. "

524
00:32:31,932 --> 00:32:34,285
- Instead of a bell tower...
- It's the clock tower!

525
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:37,670
Detective, wait.
A civilian has been taken as well.

526
00:32:37,795 --> 00:32:40,583
She must be given priority.
If we had the slightest clue...

527
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:44,127
You've got other units, chief.
I'll be going to get my partner now.

528
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,129
Detective!

529
00:32:46,837 --> 00:32:48,987
Can you tell us where Abigail is?

530
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,470
I can't.

531
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,029
There's no way to save them both.

532
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,921
It's Jules. We know where she is,
we follow Lassie.

533
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:04,296
We save Juliet.

534
00:33:07,897 --> 00:33:08,947
I'll drive.

535
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:10,839
Henry, go home.

536
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,455
- Your role{\ here} is finished.
- Not a chance{\ in hell}.

537
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,108
You, too, are a civilian,
and therefore an unnecessary risk.

538
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:19,521
- All right, I accept.
- Excuse me?

539
00:33:19,646 --> 00:33:22,416
The job you offered me, Karen.
I accept.

540
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:26,316
Cut me a little slack
on the wardrobe. It's great to be back.

541
00:33:28,531 --> 00:33:29,590
Gus, wait.

542
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:33,345
The cover.

543
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,305
Yang didn't draw herself.

544
00:33:37,022 --> 00:33:39,766
She drew Abigail... on the pier.
I think I know where she is.

545
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:41,934
- Let's go{\ get her}.
- No{\, no, no}. I could be wrong.

546
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,813
- {\You }Go with the chief, {\. You }help Lassie.
- {\Shawn, }You're not going alone.

547
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:48,244
{\Gus, }The only way that I can not be there
for Juliet is if I know that you are.

548
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:49,651
And I won't be alone.

549
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,980
Boats.

550
00:34:00,024 --> 00:34:02,830
All right, don't worry, son.
If she's here, we'll find her.

551
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:21,849
She's under the pier, isn't she?

552
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,073
I see you, sweetheart.
Blink once for yes, and two for no.

553
00:34:42,198 --> 00:34:44,956
Are there any explosives
that I can trigger by coming in?

554
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,369
You've got to be kidding me!

555
00:35:03,494 --> 00:35:06,811
Take the stairs. I'll man
the point and set up a perimeter.

556
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:13,778
We've really come full circle{\, huh}? This is
where I stood you up on our first date.

557
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,737
Thanks for showing up this time.

558
00:35:17,987 --> 00:35:20,032
- How was your trip?
- Awesome!

559
00:35:20,543 --> 00:35:23,369
It's just rope!
{\Please }Tell me you {\still }carry your swiss.

560
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,955
Of course I do.
I taught you that.

561
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,124
Come on in! The water's great!

562
00:35:29,651 --> 00:35:31,529
You just concentrate
on your breathing.

563
00:35:31,654 --> 00:35:34,380
I promise not to try anything
while I'm down there.

564
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,556
It's getting higher!

565
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,189
Hurry!

566
00:35:57,954 --> 00:35:59,257
We're almost there.

567
00:35:59,382 --> 00:36:00,832
We're almost there.

568
00:36:14,342 --> 00:36:15,962
O'Hara! My God.

569
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:19,550
All right, don't worry.
We'll get you out of this!

570
00:36:31,851 --> 00:36:34,531
You gotta do something, quick!
I can't hold it for long!

571
00:36:59,974 --> 00:37:00,883
Good work!

572
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,039
We got you. We got you.

573
00:37:09,857 --> 00:37:11,857
- All right.
- You all right?

574
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:22,905
We got her.

575
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,199
It was close, but we got her.
She's OK.

576
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:26,369
God.

577
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:27,728
Thank God.

578
00:37:30,064 --> 00:37:31,498
Abigail's okay too. She's good.

579
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,210
Gus, he was here.

580
00:37:37,247 --> 00:37:39,338
<i>I saw him.
I could have touched him.</i>

581
00:37:39,998 --> 00:37:41,257
{\But }I had to let him go.

582
00:37:42,102 --> 00:37:43,502
You had no choice.

583
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:45,592
You did the right thing.

584
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:48,475
You know, this game isn't over.

585
00:37:49,182 --> 00:37:50,182
I know.

586
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:54,387
Thanks for being there, buddy.

587
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:03,541
Juliet's Okay.

588
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,397
Good. Good.

589
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:08,618
Listen, you take care of your girl.

590
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:10,922
I'll go talk to the cops.

591
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:12,047
All right?

592
00:38:13,962 --> 00:38:15,712
How about the swiss, huh?

593
00:38:16,104 --> 00:38:18,004
Never leave home without it.

594
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:21,639
No, I mean{\, uh}... I think you've got
my knife, I've got yours.

595
00:38:22,877 --> 00:38:24,527
Did we get switched up?

596
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:27,194
Look at that.

597
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:29,464
God,
yours is so much bigger than mine.{\pub}

598
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:43,011
You warm enough?

599
00:38:45,676 --> 00:38:46,743
Okay, here goes.

600
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:50,779
{\pos(192,240)}I know this is probably a gut reaction
to everything that we just went through.

601
00:38:50,904 --> 00:38:53,982
{\pos(192,240)}But the fact that we are sitting here,
I mean here, in this place,

602
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:56,826
it has to mean something,
doesn't it?

603
00:38:57,631 --> 00:38:59,259
I mean, what if I said

604
00:38:59,384 --> 00:39:02,088
that I was willing to learn
how to compromise?

605
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:05,217
Yeah, and meet you halfway...
on everything.

606
00:39:06,728 --> 00:39:08,036
You make me laugh.

607
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,930
And... you make me feel
like I'm a little bit crazy.

608
00:39:12,055 --> 00:39:15,807
And I know that if I just let myself,
I could completely fall...

609
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,282
But there's a lot of things
that I want to do.

610
00:39:21,846 --> 00:39:23,786
I'm not just kindergarten teacher

611
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:26,116
who wants to settle down
and make a family.

612
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:28,699
{\I want to- }I want to make a difference.

613
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:31,518
I want to inspire people.

614
00:39:32,516 --> 00:39:33,953
And I can't do any of that

615
00:39:34,495 --> 00:39:35,595
if I'm dead.

616
00:39:41,355 --> 00:39:42,605
You inspire me.

617
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,810
I'm just not cut out for this.

618
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:06,616
That's okay.

619
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:13,091
I'm sorry, Abigail.

620
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:14,695
Call me...

621
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:18,956
If you ever decide
to stop chasing psychopaths.

622
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,350
<i>You're just amazing.</i>

623
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,939
<i>My most admirable foe.</i>

624
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,966
<i>That's why I chose you.</i>

625
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,116
<i>We're gonna be
working together again.</i>

626
00:42:15,523 --> 00:42:16,923
<i>I knew you'd come.</i>
