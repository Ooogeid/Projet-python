1
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,907
Get in here a second.

2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:09,283
Gus, what are you doing here?

3
00:00:09,403 --> 00:00:11,514
I'm representing shawn
in this situation.

4
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:14,016
Shawn!
Get in here.

5
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:21,840
Take a look around.

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,319
Well, what am I looking at?

7
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:26,650
Something's missing.

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,026
I took something of yours.

9
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:29,657
You need to figure out what it is.

10
00:00:29,817 --> 00:00:30,964
Dad, you robbed me?

11
00:00:31,084 --> 00:00:33,341
No, robbery's the taking of property
by force or fear.

12
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:35,330
I'm not afraid of anyone in this room.

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,290
So you're a burglar then?

14
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:39,125
No, gus.
Burglary involves breaking in.

15
00:00:39,663 --> 00:00:41,686
This is theft, pure and simple.

16
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:43,545
You need to figure out what it is...

17
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:47,132
or you're not getting it back.
Concentrate.

18
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:07,708
You thief!

19
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:09,030
You stole my bb gun.

20
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,022
Technically, yes, theft makes
me a thief.

21
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:13,409
- You're learning.
- So can I have it back now?

22
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:14,770
No.

23
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,895
I told you not to play with
it in the yard.

24
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:18,540
It's too dangerous.

25
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,167
But you said if I figured out
what was missing, I--

26
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:22,663
thieves always lie.

27
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:24,044
Remember that.

28
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:26,422
How'd you even know I was playing
with it in the backyard?

29
00:02:21,913 --> 00:02:25,022
Mr. Coburn, we are interested
in anything you can tell us.

30
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:28,317
They were big and scary, these guys.

31
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,920
Didn't you say you didn't see them?

32
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:33,114
That's... right.

33
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:35,469
Of course they were big and scary.
Look at this place.

34
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,952
- The man's lucky to be alive.
- Carlton, I've got this.

35
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:41,581
- What time did you begin your shift?
- 8:00.

36
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:44,120
- Are you the only watchman?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,919
Would you mind showing me where you
were standing at the time of the attack?

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,918
Yeah.

39
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,800
I was walking through here.

40
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:03,269
Spencer, what the hell are
you doing up there?

41
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:06,119
Right now I'm putting my hand
in my pocket, sans thumb,

42
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,690
pointing at an imaginary seagull.

43
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:10,400
But earlier I got a call from the chief.

44
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,961
She sounded serious.

45
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:13,901
Third break-in of its kind
in as many months.

46
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,948
- No leads.
- Chief told you that?

47
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:17,897
No, she did.

48
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:20,037
She looks like the venus de milo,

49
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:22,088
but she prefers to be called
Traci with an "i."

50
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,257
She saw everything.

51
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:26,542
Said I should check the videos
in the surveillance room.

52
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,775
- The mannequin told you that?
- No, chief did.

53
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:30,986
Come on, Lassie, keep up with me here.

54
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,820
- I need you paying attention.
- Do you think you can make that happen?

55
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,013
I only opened my book
for a second, Shawn.

56
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,322
- You know I have to study for my exam.
- Right.

57
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:42,931
The RX... something.

58
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:44,629
RX Rep, RX.

59
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:47,207
Pharmaceutical rep
re-certification exam.

60
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,433
That is the second worst
name for a test ever,

61
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:52,520
right after the proctological practicum.

62
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,086
My job depends on it and you said
you were gonna help me.

63
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:57,489
I'm not sure how I can.
You keep such sloppy notes.

64
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,632
What is this green slime on your book?
Did you come from kids' choice awards?

65
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:02,543
- This place is filthy.
- Maybe it's a clue.

66
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:04,080
- Maybe it's urine.
- Smell it.

67
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,681
I'm not gonna smell it.
Are you gonna help me or not?

68
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,773
We've never had more
than two people in this room.

69
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:12,899
It's cozy, which means I'll need
everyone's hands where I can see them.

70
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,878
That means yours, too, chief.

71
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:17,406
- Who's this?
- That's our psychic, Shawn Spencer.

72
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:20,526
Psychic, and treasurer of
the american wicker council.

73
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:23,121
I'm up for re-election.
I'm running on a rattan platform.

74
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:25,175
- Stuart.
- This is my favorite booster,

75
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:27,823
- detective carlton lass...
- Would you just play the tape?

76
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:35,361
That's a lariat move.

77
00:04:36,398 --> 00:04:38,405
These guys are ex-military.
No question.

78
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:47,769
And that one there is calling the shots,

79
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,084
so there appears to be a pattern here.

80
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:53,462
Well, detectives,

81
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:56,694
when you know something,
you could find me in my office.

82
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:01,180
Hey, chief.

83
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:09,103
All right, we definitely
need to check out

84
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:12,210
all the local paramilitary groups,
the security contractors, rotc.

85
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,397
Santa barbara ladies auxiliary.

86
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,901
Oh, they're women.

87
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,678
It can't be women.

88
00:05:21,798 --> 00:05:23,745
This kind of thing took
some kind of muscle.

89
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,370
It's a little shocking, isn't it?

90
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,055
Not as shocking as this:

91
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:30,057
these are 31s and they're really
pulling through here.

92
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:32,173
Make yourself useful.
Get me the 32s.

93
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,421
I don't have time for this.
Either you have something or you don't.

94
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:46,849
Got it.
Let's go see the chief.

95
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:49,487
- You got it?
- Let's just say I've got suspects.

96
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:51,274
Good.
Let's go and give them the names.

97
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,693
I got studying to do.
How many suspects are we talking?

98
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:55,342
Eh, give or take--

99
00:05:57,352 --> 00:05:58,902
80 suspects?

100
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:00,653
Really, Mr. Spencer.

101
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:04,532
It wouldn't be possible perhaps
to narrow it down just a bit, would it?

102
00:06:04,694 --> 00:06:06,660
Not without help.
It's a tight group, chief.

103
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,727
It's a clique.

104
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,474
It's a sisterhood of the ya-ya variety,

105
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:11,389
and it's gonna take
a lot more than a smile

106
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,306
and a pack of pall malls
to get 'em to talk.

107
00:06:13,426 --> 00:06:16,085
Not a problem. Tough-to-crack suspects
are right in my wheel house.

108
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:18,130
Negative, we cannot go about this

109
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,503
using a typical lassitarian technique.

110
00:06:20,623 --> 00:06:21,922
We need someone...

111
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,969
On the inside.

112
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:27,096
Are you saying you want
to go undercover?

113
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:29,433
Undercover? Yes.
Me? No.

114
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:31,702
Unfortunately I'm not qualified
for this sort of thing.

115
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:32,935
Don't worry about it.

116
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:35,460
I've been itching to do
some undercover work and

117
00:06:35,924 --> 00:06:37,357
I've got a new moustache guy.

118
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:39,432
I like where your head's at,

119
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:42,776
because this is going to take
a very specific skill set.

120
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:44,615
There is only one person in this room

121
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:46,367
that can pull it off.

122
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:48,362
I've just got one question.

123
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:51,983
Can you skate?

124
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:54,666
And it's looking like we're in for an

125
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:56,752
an excruciating jam as maniac

126
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:59,354
cuts through the pack like a machete.

127
00:06:59,474 --> 00:07:02,633
That defense had better get on
the defensive or else.

128
00:07:02,753 --> 00:07:04,016
Ooh, look out below!

00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:35,953
the garden of beatin'!

134
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:40,300
And it's Miss anthropy
around the outside.

135
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:42,630
Don't let her through!

136
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,632
Pick her up!

137
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,041
Pick her up!
Somebody pick her up!

138
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:48,374
I couldn't have called
a better assignment.

139
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:50,429
Yeah, right.
You're a rocket scientist.

140
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:53,936
I thought the police had a suspect from
the roller derby, like, a month ago.

141
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,416
- Seven-- seven--
- Seven deadly cinderella.

142
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:58,063
Yeah, but it didn't go anywhere.

143
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,714
What did you find that got chief Vick
back onto this roller derby angle?

144
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:03,244
Oh, just everything.

145
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,589
Damage, the hand signals.

146
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,700
The scuff marks on the floor
were caused by

147
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,153
62-millimeter core composite
competition skate wheels.

148
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:15,341
Vick wouldn't buy it until
I threw in some roller babble.

149
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:18,208
Think about it.
Who better for a smash and grab job...

150
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:19,550
than an organized team?

151
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:22,129
You think they were all on wheels?

152
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:24,034
At least one of them was.

153
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,536
What makes you so sure
it was one of these teams?

154
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,285
You want to take this one?

155
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:29,521
What?

156
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:32,472
Check the schedule. These were
the only two teams who were off

157
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:34,336
on all the nights the break-ins
occurred.

158
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:37,402
We call that detective work.
It's a rare and beautiful thing.

159
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:38,895
Like clubbed thumbs.

160
00:08:39,973 --> 00:08:42,577
I don't know how we're gonna solve
this case. These women scare me.

161
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:44,401
Are you kidding?
It's a cake assignment.

162
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:47,559
I used to do some security work
for the roller derby back in the day.

163
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,614
Those broads, they knew
how to get the job done.

164
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:51,798
This is-- I don't know.
This is like a fashion show.

165
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:55,092
- These broads, they don't hit
- That's why we brought you down here.

166
00:08:55,212 --> 00:08:57,214
To hear you say "broads"
repeatedly.

167
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:59,903
Why don't you explain to us
how all this works.

168
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:01,912
Do you see the one with the star
on her helmet?

169
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:03,851
She's the lead jammer. She scores points

170
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:06,172
when she passes the opposing skaters.

171
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:08,589
All right, look at her, right there.
The one they call fox--

172
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:10,475
She's reaching down.
She's up to something.

173
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:11,773
See that piece of tape?

174
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:13,405
Number 13.
She's been marked.

175
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:15,432
She's gonna get hit.
She's gonna be taken down.

176
00:09:15,592 --> 00:09:17,754
Watch this.
Watch it. Here it goes.

177
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,313
Oh, and there's another one
for the suicide seats!

178
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,676
It's happy times for westwood, wilde,

179
00:09:25,796 --> 00:09:28,846
and captain denise "kamikaze" fox.

180
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:32,183
This is our only chance
to snoop around, gus.

181
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:33,198
Let's go.

182
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:34,922
- Dad, you all right?
- Hit her!

183
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,753
No, hit her now!
She's down!

184
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:37,947
He's fine.

185
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,367
Would you--

186
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:40,626
hit!

187
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,020
What are we doing, shawn?

188
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,541
Well, for starters, we're both
growing moustaches

189
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:48,057
very, very slowly,
but we're also investigating.

190
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:50,688
This is Juliet's investigation.
We're gonna blow her cover.

191
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:53,219
- We need to stay out of her way.
- You're exactly right, gus.

192
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:57,765
Or we do the exact opposite.
I vote for number two.

193
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,871
Be my lookout.

194
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:05,935
No, there's only a few minutes left,
shawn, and you want to go inside...

195
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:15,446
Worst lookout ever.

196
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:17,553
You didn't see the girl walk in?

197
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:20,251
And I round this corner,
and there's maniac.

198
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:22,057
And I'm, like, "where'd she go?"

199
00:11:22,219 --> 00:11:25,603
And she's, like, "where'd who go?"
She moves pretty good for fresh meat.

200
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:28,231
That's totally a compliment.
Where'd you learn to skate like that?

201
00:11:28,391 --> 00:11:30,607
Oh, you know, college roller-skate team.

202
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:33,486
And Xanadu.

203
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:38,241
That's funny.
I get it.

204
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,316
Dude, you are leering.

205
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:50,002
And if by leering, you mean
staring oddly

206
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:53,589
in a creepy way, yes, but it's for
an investigation, gus.

207
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:55,758
They're all scraped up
from burglarizing.

208
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,928
Burglarization?
Burglarism.

209
00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:01,264
Of course they're scraped up.
It's a full contact sport.

210
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:04,434
Since when do we get injuries
underneath our elbow pads.

211
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:07,289
And that's a glass cut on the other one.
Check it out.

212
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:13,526
That's leering.

213
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:19,404
- Shawn, what are you guys doing here?
- I'm moving on this case.

214
00:12:19,524 --> 00:12:21,975
I'm pretty sure I found the extra
sensory vortex in this building.

215
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:23,530
- Where?
- Women's locker room.

216
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,717
Which is a place I've always wanted
to hang out,

217
00:12:25,837 --> 00:12:28,040
- so it's totally a win-win.
- I get this is how you work.

218
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,240
But this is not how we are going
to be doing things.

219
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,056
I am lead detective, and this is first
and foremost a police investigation.

220
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:36,381
So if we are going to be partners,
we are going to be doing things my way.

221
00:12:36,543 --> 00:12:38,709
All kidding aside, I got some
serious vibes in there.

222
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:40,149
And possibly athlete's foot.

223
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:42,472
Great, i'll check it out and
come by your office later,

224
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:44,755
but right now I need you guys
to get out of here.

225
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,435
Is this guy bothering you, maniac?

226
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,270
Wilde, fox, this is--

227
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,444
- This is...
- I know who this guy is.

228
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,692
We see gawkers like him all
the time around here.

229
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:56,902
Really easy to spot.

230
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:59,321
There's always one thing off about them.

231
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:01,616
Clothes, hair,

232
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:03,034
teeth.

233
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:04,973
You just named my three best features.

234
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:06,656
Fourth on the list, posture.

235
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:08,597
Fifth, elocution.

236
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:12,168
Maniacmaniac19, president pro-tem,

237
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:13,544
maniac fan club.

238
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:16,767
This is my vice president,
longbranch pennywhistle.

239
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:19,175
I'm just looking to score a little
face time with the maniac,

240
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:21,469
you know, for the blog.

241
00:13:21,755 --> 00:13:23,971
689 hits and climbing.

242
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,858
Nothing I can't handle.

243
00:13:25,978 --> 00:13:27,737
I was just about to give 'em
an interview.

244
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,268
It was only gonna be two words.

245
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:34,299
Okay, come on.

246
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:37,544
I'll see you tonight.
Bring the outfit.

247
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:39,044
One of us might wear it.

248
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:40,384
Get lost!

249
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:55,753
Might I have a word in my office?

250
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:05,971
Oh, sorry, chief.
I have to break these things in,

251
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:09,058
and you know how my family is cursed
with bad arches, right?

252
00:14:09,218 --> 00:14:10,351
Please take them off.

253
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:12,019
I was just gonna suggest that.

254
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:13,712
Later.

255
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:17,942
Did you break somebody's nose?

256
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:20,361
Yes, I did.
Thank you.

257
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:22,821
Oh, but it was a clean hit.

258
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:25,866
It was actually more of a dislocation.
You know, it just popped right back in.

259
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:29,958
Yeah, she curled into my wingspan,
so I was totally justified.

260
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,479
We're friends now.
She has a cat.

261
00:14:33,345 --> 00:14:36,859
I'm concerned for your safety
and that this might be a mistake.

262
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:39,380
No, no, no.
It is not a mistake.

263
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,131
It's actually a very smart call.

264
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,612
I have found a scad of priors
on my suspects.

265
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:45,094
Aggravated assault, battery.

266
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,429
Oh! And reckless endangerment.

267
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,889
So you're saying putting you
in danger is a bonus?

268
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:52,059
I'm telling you I can handle myself.

269
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:55,562
I didn't want to do
this in the first place,

270
00:14:55,723 --> 00:14:57,232
and I'll be candid, O'Hara.

271
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:59,964
You tend to dive in a little too deeply
when you go undercover.

272
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:02,524
Look, chief...
First off,

273
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:04,593
roller derby is better than therapy.

274
00:15:04,713 --> 00:15:06,323
If I were into that sort of thing.

275
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,543
And secondly, these girls,
they're not making any money.

276
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:11,370
Most of them are paying out of pocket,

277
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,872
they are all the right element
for this kind of behavior.

278
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:16,536
Hunches and profiles
are not gonna keep this thing going.

279
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:18,388
I need concrete proof...

280
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:19,783
soon.

281
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:24,007
I want every single one of those
suspects from that security video.

282
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:25,623
Done.

283
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:31,404
This a typo, right?

284
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:33,100
$800 for skates?

285
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:37,227
Would it help if I told you
the other pairs weren't cute at all?

286
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:39,857
Get me results.
Hurry.

287
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:51,764
This is "maniac".

288
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:56,372
Tonight?

289
00:15:58,604 --> 00:16:00,248
Yeah, I can keep it quiet.

290
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:02,640
Okay.

291
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,721
I'll be there.

292
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:09,892
I'm sorry I'm late.

293
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:13,419
Oh, my God.

294
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,797
Is there somebody here?
Are you on a date?

295
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:22,274
I didn't know if you'd be hungry,
I threw something together quickly.

296
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:26,308
We gotta get right to this.
I was just at the station,

297
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:29,213
- I really think I am on to something.
- That's great.

298
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,990
We have all night to talk about it.

299
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,003
- Gewurztraminer?
- Yes... No!

300
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:35,383
I can't stay.
I got a call from one of the girls.

301
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:37,492
- Are those crab cakes?
- Yes, they are.

302
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:39,317
With dill and coriander.

303
00:16:40,223 --> 00:16:42,543
- Which girl are we talking about?
- They call her

304
00:16:42,705 --> 00:16:44,971
"toxic waste",
but her name is Shelly.

305
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,924
Said she was talking to some of the
other girls and that they were very

306
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:50,243
impressed by me,
I am perfect for something

307
00:16:50,363 --> 00:16:53,847
they have going on downtown tonight.
A money-making opportunity.

308
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:02,426
Don't go.

309
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,111
I ran some of their names.

310
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:07,800
- They have records.
- I've already eliminated "toxic waste".

311
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,338
- She wasn't at the break-in.
- I don't think you understand.

312
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:14,325
I am undercover right now,
things can get real sticky, real fast.

313
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:15,539
Sticky how?

314
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:17,761
Listen.
This thing that's happening tonight,

315
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:19,289
it's not what you think it is.

316
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,625
Now, sit down, have some endives.

317
00:17:21,785 --> 00:17:23,216
Are we working together or not?

318
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:25,798
Technically we're working together
on this case, but you know what?

319
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:29,255
- I'm not feeling together right now.
- Then support me.

320
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,434
Because I really think
I am on to something.

321
00:17:31,554 --> 00:17:34,458
I gotta go
and you're either in or you're out.

322
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:52,511
North exit, south exit.
Nobody gets out.

323
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,117
You do realize
we're outside of a warehouse.

324
00:17:56,277 --> 00:17:58,778
That's not the point.
Even if it's not a burglary,

325
00:17:58,898 --> 00:18:01,373
it's likely some kind
of criminal activity.

326
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,499
This place isn't like
any of the others.

327
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:05,972
I am really sorry
I have to do this to you, but...

328
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:10,881
Spencer, you're in the way.

329
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:11,755
Go.

330
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:15,541
We're gonna let her get in here.

331
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,013
And on her signal,

332
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,150
we're gonna light this candle.

333
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,484
- Brilliant! Beautiful!
- Stand down.

334
00:18:29,604 --> 00:18:31,695
Do it again!
Reset the playback, please.

335
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:33,476
A music video shoot?

336
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:37,033
I sent nearly a dozen uniformed officers
and six black and whites,

337
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:39,119
and none of your suspects
were even there.

338
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:42,667
I'm gonna need a pretty damn compelling
reason not to pull the plug on this one,

339
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,874
because right now, we've got nothing.

340
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:46,592
It was me.

341
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:49,282
I felt a vibe.
I got a message.

342
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:50,629
You did?

343
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,511
Yes.

344
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:54,515
Turns out it
was a major metaphysical snafu.

345
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,357
O'Hara said it was a non-start.

346
00:18:56,513 --> 00:18:58,772
I threw a tantrum.
I was crying,

347
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:01,385
kicking, and stamping my little feet.

348
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:05,126
They're not abnormally small.

349
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:08,480
Chief, I can get results.
Let me in on this.

350
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:11,097
Sure, chief.
Lassie seems like a smart choice.

351
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,438
We know he's a demon on wheels,
and he's so very good with women.

352
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:16,916
Under the circumstances,
I might consider you.

353
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:19,582
But you're never more obvious than
when you're undercover.

354
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:23,181
Perhaps you've forgotten
the prosthetic nose debacle of 2005?

355
00:19:35,014 --> 00:19:37,332
Chief, we are definitely onto something.

356
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:40,521
Last night's robbery fits the pattern
we've seen between criminal activity

357
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:43,080
and specific teams. We've narrowed
it down to a few suspects.

358
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,809
Three suspects.
Teammates, friends, pen pals.

359
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:47,187
Solid suspects.

360
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:49,103
Maybe four.

361
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:50,386
Possibly five.

362
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:53,640
- Six could...
- The idea is to have fewer

363
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,321
suspects.
You don't get paid by the suspect.

364
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:58,114
I see us closing this by tomorrow.

365
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:01,109
- Tomorrow then.
- Absolutely.

366
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:01,951
Fine.

367
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:05,353
But I'm gonna need results
without another incident, metaphysical

368
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:06,808
or otherwise.

369
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:08,707
You're all dismissed.

370
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,878
She really unloaded on us.

371
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,229
Thank you
for taking the heat on that one.

372
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:21,652
That's how it goes
when you're partners.

373
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:25,149
If I could count the number of times
that Gus has left my cheese in the wind.

374
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:27,028
- What?
- Nothing. Study on, buddy.

375
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:29,777
Arteriosclerosis, rosacea, croup.

376
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,838
- Croup?
- You'll have to owe me one.

377
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,399
Or... you can give me
one of these bracelets.

378
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,819
They come in teal?

379
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:39,738
- Can't do.
- Can't do teal?

380
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,115
Westwood gave it to me.

381
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:43,333
A roller derby thing.
Think of something else.

382
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:46,703
You can dial back the "maniac" routine.
Stop pulling rank on me.

383
00:20:47,197 --> 00:20:48,705
- Ordering me around.
- Fine.

384
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:51,166
And smoothies
are on you until we nab someone.

385
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:54,337
I want to figure out the next step
by seeing how you work.

386
00:20:54,497 --> 00:20:57,298
I want to get close to your process.
Get some hard evidence.

387
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,674
Yeah. That's a good idea.

388
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:01,778
Why don't you bring her right
in on your process?

389
00:21:01,898 --> 00:21:03,959
Here's the thing.
Close is good.

390
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:05,514
Very close is even better.

391
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:06,849
But not for this.

392
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:09,977
My process is not a tandem bike,
it's a unicycle.

393
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:11,895
You belong at practice.

394
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:13,579
I can see fox.

395
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,203
- You gotta keep an eye on her.
- That's gonna be difficult.

396
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:18,525
She's always surrounded
by Westwood and Wilde.

397
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,488
Perfect.
Keep an eye on them too.

398
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:25,681
There.

399
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,809
The lists... from Vick's desk.

400
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:31,536
They make absolutely
no sense whatsoever.

401
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:33,630
Why don't you arrange them
in alphabetical order?

402
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,457
That's not the point.
They stole a dvd of spanglish.

403
00:21:36,577 --> 00:21:40,010
- They weren't after the merchandise.
- That's not exactly hard evidence.

404
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,133
- Thank you, professor no help.
- What?

405
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:46,108
I'm sorry. Did you miss that?
Maybe I should've said MC no help

406
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:48,807
or Doctor do-nothing because
you're bringing nothing to the table.

407
00:21:48,969 --> 00:21:50,309
I have a test, remember?

408
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:52,432
No pass, no job.

409
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:54,397
No job, no driving you around.

410
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:58,245
Besides, you're doing perfectly fine
with your new partner.

411
00:21:58,365 --> 00:22:00,408
- Who? Jules?
- "Who? Jules?"

412
00:22:00,812 --> 00:22:02,080
Who do you think?

413
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,864
- Don't be jealous.
- I'm not.

414
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:06,950
Don't be vexed. You're still number one
on my myspace page.

415
00:22:07,112 --> 00:22:10,088
Jules and I are just working
a case together. Nothing more.

416
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:17,400
What is this green slime on your book?
You come from the kid's choice awards?

417
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,628
This place is filthy.

418
00:22:19,324 --> 00:22:20,993
- Wilde was there.
- What?

419
00:22:21,113 --> 00:22:22,966
Cynthia "speed freak" Wilde

420
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:25,293
was there at Zilk's
during the break-in.

421
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:27,805
She uses this green oil
to lubricate her skates.

422
00:22:29,463 --> 00:22:31,434
Looks like she left some behind.

423
00:22:31,594 --> 00:22:32,810
Good clue, buddy.

424
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:37,351
You have fox with the broken watch and
now wilde. Why don't you call the cops?

425
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:39,594
According to the tapes,
there were at least three more.

426
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:42,317
If we don't get them, they're gonna
doing their thing. That...

427
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:44,409
is the oath of thieves.

428
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:47,420
That... is the code of the roller girl.

429
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:50,410
I never thought
I would hear you say that.

430
00:22:50,572 --> 00:22:53,700
Even more than sinkhole sissy feet
flapjack go-go boots?

431
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:56,876
Juliet isn't answering her phone.

432
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:03,566
You know, those crab cakes are,
like, three days old or something.

433
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:07,831
Okay, remember, "maniac",
the key is to just get through the pack.

434
00:23:08,528 --> 00:23:10,890
- Whatever it takes.
- We don't want to injure anyone

435
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,099
- in practice, do we?
- Of course not.

436
00:23:13,303 --> 00:23:15,603
If someone's shoulder has to get
dislocated,

437
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:17,954
make sure it isn't yours.

438
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,938
Back to it, boss?

439
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,734
- Wait, where is "lethal weapon"?
- Oh, Westwood?

440
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:25,821
She had to split a second ago,
go visit her mother.

441
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:29,408
- Let's go kick some ass.
- Cool.

442
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:32,600
- I'm just gonna grab something.
- Okay, see you on the track.

443
00:23:38,535 --> 00:23:40,365
- You leaving?
- Yeah.

444
00:23:40,788 --> 00:23:43,463
- Everything okay?
- I have to go meet my boyfriend.

445
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,000
He's kinda got car trouble, so...

446
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,538
I have to go.

447
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,299
He's kind of stranded out
on the mesa somewhere.

448
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:55,892
Okay, all right, make sure
you bring him to the bout tomorrow.

449
00:23:56,054 --> 00:23:57,304
Yeah, I'll try.

450
00:23:59,255 --> 00:24:00,418
See ya later.

451
00:24:55,737 --> 00:24:58,927
I found a couple of hand-held
scanning machines here at the hall.

452
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:01,115
You feel anything on scanning machines?

453
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:02,668
Scanning machines?

454
00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:04,043
For making copies.

455
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:09,486
Copying devices are notoriously
unreliable psychic fetters.

456
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:12,593
Now, if they were
three-hole punchers, different story.

457
00:25:12,754 --> 00:25:15,383
I'm gonna look around some more,
but I wanted to let you know

458
00:25:15,503 --> 00:25:17,427
Westwood left practice early today.

459
00:25:17,547 --> 00:25:20,213
She gave me some lie
and then she just took off.

460
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:26,941
I'm getting something now. Street
clothes, green tank top, jeans, belt...

461
00:25:27,103 --> 00:25:29,023
Terrible, terrible belt.

462
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:31,597
- Do you see her?
- <i>En mi cabesa</i>.

463
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:34,479
<i>I got a psychic track on her now.</i>

464
00:25:35,642 --> 00:25:38,349
Okay, I gotta go.
Call Lassiter if you find anything out.

465
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:40,449
Of course.
I'll call Lassiter.

466
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:42,292
I'm not calling Lassiter.

467
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:52,584
Follow the bouncing Westwood.

468
00:26:11,966 --> 00:26:14,291
Not too close.
She's gonna see us.

469
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,749
- Dude... is that...
- What?

470
00:26:25,497 --> 00:26:28,197
I think there's a body
in the back of that truck.

471
00:26:28,777 --> 00:26:29,837
It's not a body.

472
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:31,797
It is! That's a head.

473
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:35,084
This test has got you all jacked up.
You're not thinking straight.

474
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:37,679
You're distracted trying to remember
the difference between lermacil

475
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,070
- and hermacil.
- Lermacil is for fever blisters.

476
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,559
- Hermacil is for eczema.
- What about chermacil?

477
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:44,281
No such thing as chermacil.

478
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:45,499
Studying.

479
00:26:50,978 --> 00:26:53,111
Sweet fantasy island,
that is a body!

480
00:26:53,272 --> 00:26:54,333
I told you.

481
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:55,798
Not too close.

482
00:26:56,726 --> 00:26:59,505
Westwood is ditching a body.
That's the break in the case we need.

483
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:02,102
We need is to call Lassiter
like Juliet said. And back off a little.

484
00:27:02,222 --> 00:27:04,331
- She's gonna see us.
- We're not calling him. You know

485
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:07,060
how this works. I really have
to explain it to you every single time?

486
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,563
You lost Westwood.

487
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:10,501
Damn it!

488
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:21,634
Bingo.

489
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:52,207
- Let's go.
- I'm not going out there.

490
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:54,763
Dude, it's only gonna take a second.

491
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,307
You cannot sit here
alone in the dark in a parked car.

492
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,226
- You'll get picked up for Mopery.
- Mopery?

493
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,011
With intent to creep.
Trust me,

494
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:03,247
it'll kick a big hole in your future.

495
00:28:24,594 --> 00:28:26,273
I guess it wasn't a body.

496
00:28:42,544 --> 00:28:43,999
Well done, Spencer.

497
00:28:44,363 --> 00:28:47,014
I don't know, chief. You want me
to try and get her statement?

498
00:28:47,134 --> 00:28:49,162
Of course, I don't speak mannequin.

499
00:28:50,552 --> 00:28:52,437
Cute.
You might want to hold off on that

500
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:56,059
because we still have all the
merchandise from the zilk's burglaries.

501
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:58,114
- Excellent work.
- Thanks, chief.

502
00:28:58,234 --> 00:29:00,210
It's all right.
I accept your apology.

503
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,640
So the burglars
weren't after the merchandise.

504
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,990
- That's right.
- So what were they after?

505
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:09,223
One, two, three, four, five.

506
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,174
Five, four.

507
00:29:11,473 --> 00:29:13,084
- Four, five.
- What?

508
00:29:13,244 --> 00:29:16,047
I'm seeing four and I'm seeing five.
Lassie, four and five!

509
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:18,506
- Nine? The number nine?
- No, four times five.

510
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:19,793
- 20?
- 5 and 20.

511
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:21,384
- 5 times 20.
- 100.

512
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:23,845
- Minus 4 times 4 times 5.
- 4 times 4 times 5?

513
00:29:24,005 --> 00:29:25,218
- 80.
- No, 20.

514
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:28,560
100 minus 80 is 20.
We all have our math facts straight.

515
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,195
Is this going somewhere?

516
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,213
Skater number 20.
She's the one who dumped all this stuff.

517
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,523
That's Rita "lethal weapon" Westwood.

518
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:37,461
Great, we got one.
We need all of 'em.

519
00:29:37,581 --> 00:29:39,410
Correct.
This is bigger than Westwood.

520
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,613
A lot bigger.
Juliet's close.

521
00:29:44,224 --> 00:29:48,146
Let's get someone on the lookout
for any more dumping sites around town.

522
00:29:53,607 --> 00:29:55,753
We've got to get to Zilk's,
and check something out.

523
00:29:55,873 --> 00:29:58,130
If you say "pants,"
I'm gonna sock you in your Adam's apple.

524
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,568
Sock you in your...

525
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:05,303
Hey, it's me.
Listen, we got a situation.

526
00:30:05,463 --> 00:30:07,513
- <i>What is it?</i>
- Westwood screwed up again huge.

527
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:09,849
The cops found everything.
{\If they get to her, }She's gonna talk.

528
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,969
- <i>This is bad.</i>
- Yeah, and it gets worse.

529
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:13,728
Maniac's fan boy's also here.

530
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:15,980
- <I>Doing what?</I>
- He's working with the cops.

531
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,011
- Are we compromised?
- I don't know,

532
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:19,998
but after we handle Westwood,

533
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,557
I think we need to have a talk
with Maniac.

534
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:30,031
What are we doing here, Shawn?
We{\ already} know it wasn't the merchandise.

535
00:30:30,215 --> 00:30:31,969
But it was something else.

536
00:30:35,237 --> 00:30:36,273
Let's go.

537
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:43,216
Dude, I can't believe this.

538
00:30:43,438 --> 00:30:45,843
You lifted your look
right off this mannequin.

539
00:30:45,963 --> 00:30:49,340
On the contrary, Shawn.
Clearly, someone is stealing my look.

540
00:30:49,536 --> 00:30:50,348
Right.

541
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:54,268
I did see tommy hilfiger creeping
from bush to bush sketching you.

542
00:31:01,011 --> 00:31:02,193
And we're moving.

543
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,863
But your friend can't come.

544
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:10,701
The thieves were after something
in this room.

545
00:31:10,861 --> 00:31:13,454
Dude, we can't go inside there.
Read the sign.

546
00:31:13,614 --> 00:31:15,797
"Laura noid. Employee of the month."
You know her?

547
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,796
Not that one.
"Employees only."

548
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:19,563
Gotcha. Be my lookout.

549
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:23,422
No problem.
I'll just keep it safe from the outside.

550
00:31:25,755 --> 00:31:27,426
It's okay.
It's all right.

551
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,562
My name is Shawn Spencer.
This is my partner...

552
00:31:32,895 --> 00:31:35,205
I can't believe I'm blanking.
I've done this a million times.

553
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:37,061
- Nice work.
- Office, code blue.

554
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:38,854
It's okay.
We're not here to rob you.

555
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:41,639
Your buddy stole the clothes
right off the mannequin.

556
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:42,942
These are my clothes.

557
00:31:43,252 --> 00:31:46,070
Look, we don't keep the cash back here.
This is the credit department.

558
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:48,406
We just want to talk to you
about the burglary.

559
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:49,991
Oh, do you, mannequin man?

560
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,670
Well, why don't you tell that
to my little can of pepper spray?

561
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:56,749
Tell her!

562
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,125
It's all right.
These guys are with the police.

563
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:03,546
Why is your friend dressed
like the mannequin?

564
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:06,519
That mannequin is dressed like me.
Thank you.

565
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:08,926
- Can we go, shawn?
- Hold up. What were you doing{\ over there}?

566
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:10,679
Oh, uh, it's friday.

567
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,889
I was shredding
credit card applications.

568
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:14,723
It's the only fun thing I get to do.

569
00:32:21,598 --> 00:32:23,683
Burglary happened on a thursday.

570
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,177
The day before
they shred the credit applications.

571
00:32:28,688 --> 00:32:31,353
Thanks, guys.
It was good to see you, Stu.

572
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:40,583
Jules, I'm getting some strong messages.

573
00:32:40,743 --> 00:32:43,192
- Okay, what are they?
- First one's from Keanu Reeves.

574
00:32:43,312 --> 00:32:46,161
He's living in a house
I built on a lake two years in the past.

575
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:47,542
How will I meet him?

576
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:50,301
The second is that the thieves were not
after the merchandise.

577
00:32:50,461 --> 00:32:52,178
Well, we already know that, Shawn.

578
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,414
They were using the hand scanners
to steal information

579
00:32:54,534 --> 00:32:57,795
off credit card applications.
They're stealing identies.

580
00:32:57,915 --> 00:33:01,687
So then ransacking the store{\ and stealing the merchandise}
was just to throw us off the trail.

581
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,148
Right-o.
A handful of fake credit cards

582
00:33:04,684 --> 00:33:07,225
is worth more than everything
in that entire store times ten.

583
00:33:07,345 --> 00:33:08,798
It's a pretty brilliant plan.

584
00:33:08,918 --> 00:33:11,003
Only slightly less brilliant
than that Youtube video

585
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:12,531
of the monkey bathing the cat.

586
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,578
We need you to come with us, Maniac.

587
00:33:17,738 --> 00:33:18,762
Right now.

588
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,498
Jules, who is that?
Who's talking?

589
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:23,802
We gotta go.

590
00:33:32,782 --> 00:33:34,627
So we have three suspects.
Two to go.

591
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:36,840
- {\And }You think they're on to Juliet?
- {\I said }They might be.

592
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,975
- {\Either way, }We're gonna find out pretty quick.
- What do you think they'll do to her?

593
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:46,899
<i>Westwood gave it to me.
It's a roller derby thing.</i>

594
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,429
They may've done it already.

595
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:05,478
That's Westwood's truck.

596
00:34:15,307 --> 00:34:18,663
- I can't see anything.
- Look for something to jimmy the lock.

597
00:34:29,977 --> 00:34:31,967
- Thank god.
- Thank god?

598
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:34,696
- It's a dead person.
- Yeah, but it's not Juliet.

599
00:34:35,162 --> 00:34:37,408
It's still a human being, Shawn.
It's Westwood.

600
00:34:37,562 --> 00:34:39,344
What's the matter with you?

601
00:34:39,776 --> 00:34:42,371
You're saying you'd rather it be someone
that we know and care about?

602
00:34:42,805 --> 00:34:45,854
Fine, next time I see Jules,
I'll{\ just} tell her you wish she was dead.

603
00:34:45,974 --> 00:34:47,834
I never said
that I wish Juliet was dead.

604
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,462
<i>Lead jammer Mrs. Bash is trapped
in the pack.</i>

605
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:54,578
<i>Speed freak trying to slash
through pismo's vulnerable inside line.</i>

606
00:34:55,628 --> 00:34:58,528
<i>The trollops are gonna have to do
a 180 in the second half tonight.</i>

607
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:03,011
<i>Unless Hayseed wanna be
and off-white trash have their way,</i>

608
00:35:03,131 --> 00:35:04,559
<i>it might just happen.</i>

609
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:07,032
<i>It's down to the wire, friends.</i>

610
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:22,417
- The roller girls are onto Juliet.
- Which ones?

611
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,162
The bad ones,
and I know who they are.

612
00:35:24,593 --> 00:35:27,761
They're marking their own teammate.
They want to hurt her or worse.

613
00:35:29,202 --> 00:35:30,751
We gotta do something.

614
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,680
<i>Things are heating up out here, people.
I hope you've brought protection.</i>

615
00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:56,656
- What are you doing?
- You've been complaing about me

616
00:35:56,776 --> 00:35:58,795
not being any help here,
and that's about to change.

617
00:35:58,915 --> 00:36:01,857
They're gonna try to make a run for it,
but not before they take juliet down.

618
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:04,376
- Yes, but this is a terrible idea.
- I can skate, shawn.

619
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:05,954
I got this.

620
00:36:06,114 --> 00:36:07,427
What are you...

621
00:36:08,138 --> 00:36:10,917
Now it looks like we got
a guest on the track.

622
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:13,140
You're taking your life
in your hands, pal.

623
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:22,929
And oh, speed freak goes down!

624
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:25,390
There's something you don't see
every day.

625
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,605
Oh, man!

626
00:37:13,226 --> 00:37:14,528
Four suspects.

627
00:37:14,648 --> 00:37:15,982
It was identity theft, chief.

628
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:18,401
They were only after the information off

629
00:37:18,562 --> 00:37:20,606
the credit card applications
the customers fill out.

630
00:37:20,726 --> 00:37:23,031
All of the stores they hit had similar
credit card programs.

631
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:26,701
They break in, wreak havoc,
and split before the clock runs out.

632
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,528
Just the kind of anarchy
their fans pay for night after night.

633
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,791
I got prints off a key piece of evidence
I found here.

634
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:35,627
She got 'em when she wasn't busy
kicking ass.

635
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:40,090
Can I hear something for maniac?
She really brought it, huh?

636
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,883
Am I right?
Who's with me?

637
00:37:43,147 --> 00:37:45,720
- Lassiter, take them away.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

638
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:48,154
I'm seeing the fifth suspect.

639
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:50,780
- She get away?
- no.

640
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,603
Rita "lethal weapon" Westwood.

641
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:58,483
Unfortunately, you'll find her body in
her pickup truck in the parking lot.

642
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:02,779
She's the one that botched
the merchandise drop.

643
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:04,364
She paid dearly for it.

644
00:38:06,013 --> 00:38:06,991
Anything else?

645
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:10,356
Not really.

646
00:38:10,646 --> 00:38:14,457
Did I mention juliet's
roller derby awesomeness?

647
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:16,748
Maniac, Maniac, Maniac.

648
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:18,503
I can't get anything from these people.

649
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:21,095
They're murders, shawn.
They're going away for life.

650
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,472
I gotta study.

651
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,100
Lassiter, take them away.

652
00:38:26,407 --> 00:38:28,034
All right, ladies.

653
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:30,856
You two work together well.

654
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,142
I certainly think so.

655
00:38:32,262 --> 00:38:34,355
We're available for more cases,
by the way.

656
00:38:34,475 --> 00:38:36,856
Embezzlement, extortion, espionage.

657
00:38:36,976 --> 00:38:39,044
Pretty much anything
that starts with "e."

658
00:38:39,164 --> 00:38:40,441
Elephant theft.

659
00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:42,817
I'll take that under advisement.

660
00:38:47,226 --> 00:38:49,163
- Elephant theft?
- Oh, yeah.

661
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:52,352
- People steal elephants?
- Major problem.

662
00:38:52,671 --> 00:38:53,997
Pretty much out of control.

663
00:39:05,624 --> 00:39:07,218
Hey, jules.
What are you doing here?

664
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:10,555
I'm returning my equipment.
What are you doing here?

665
00:39:11,662 --> 00:39:13,494
Just hangin', you know?

666
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:14,788
Chillin'.

667
00:39:16,077 --> 00:39:18,277
I was actually feeling
a little nostalgic.

668
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,322
Remember when we cracked that case here

669
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:22,859
and the criminals turned out
to be roller derby girls?

670
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,111
Yeah, I remember that.

671
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:28,281
Gosh, seems like it was just yesterday.

672
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:31,743
Probably because it was yesterday.

673
00:39:31,863 --> 00:39:33,161
Why are you wearing skates?

674
00:39:34,774 --> 00:39:36,054
Oh, yeah, look at that.

675
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,123
I guess I am.

676
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:38,624
I don't know.

677
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:41,731
I guess I just thought it was a shame.

678
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:43,547
We have this big, beautiful track

679
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,339
and no one to skate on it.

680
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:47,675
It's also been a while since
I've had a good blister.

681
00:39:54,207 --> 00:39:56,173
This will be a couples skate.

682
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,405
Couples only.

683
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:04,900
Come on.

684
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:18,290
- Did you do that on purpose?
- No.

685
00:40:19,243 --> 00:40:20,254
Maybe.

686
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:23,544
Okay, yes.
Yes, I did.

687
00:40:26,947 --> 00:40:28,090
No hands.

688
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:53,719
Damn!

689
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:55,910
- What is it?
- It won't let me log in,

690
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,745
and I have to take my exam by today.

691
00:40:58,494 --> 00:40:59,519
Really?

692
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,289
It's probably because
I just took it for you.

693
00:41:03,409 --> 00:41:04,163
What?

694
00:41:04,283 --> 00:41:07,046
I can't believe you're still using
"chocolate thunder" as your password.

695
00:41:07,221 --> 00:41:09,548
You took my exam?
Little harder than the river raft test.

696
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:12,093
Way easier than the secret service test.

697
00:41:12,835 --> 00:41:15,228
Any of the questions I didn't know
I just answered "c," right?

698
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:16,428
Oh, my god.

699
00:41:17,657 --> 00:41:19,530
- Oh, my god.
- Dude, it's done.

700
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,541
Relax.
And you know what?

701
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:22,656
Nailed it!

702
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:25,231
Well, almost nailed it.

703
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,277
At the very least,
definitely didn't blow it.

704
00:41:28,397 --> 00:41:29,380
I don't think...

705
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,170
Hey, you're in, okay?

706
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:33,709
Sadly, you're still
a pharmaceutical rep.

707
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:34,865
But hey, whatever.

708
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,951
I studied for this test all week
for nothing.

709
00:41:37,111 --> 00:41:38,095
Yes, you did.

710
00:41:38,215 --> 00:41:40,412
But that's the sort of thing
that builds character.

711
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,231
Knowledge is power!

712
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:46,387
Don't you want to feel powerful?
