1
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:07,397
What's with the Michael Jackson
outfit?

2
00:00:07,472 --> 00:00:08,752
That's, like, two years old.

3
00:00:08,753 --> 00:00:09,753
I got scared.

4
00:00:09,754 --> 00:00:11,343
You were supposed to be
Billy Ocean.

5
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:16,233
Why would Michael Jackson
sing with Roland Orzabal?

6
00:00:16,314 --> 00:00:18,602
Why would Billy Ocean
sing with Roland Orzabal?

7
00:00:18,703 --> 00:00:20,094
'Cause he's awesome.

8
00:00:21,138 --> 00:00:23,644
Now we gotta add
the moonwalk into Shout

9
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:25,992
and hope the judges
don't slam us for it.

10
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:27,502
I don't know how
to moonwalk.

11
00:00:27,582 --> 00:00:29,000
You better learn quick.

12
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:30,743
Shawn Spencer
and Mr. Burton Guster.

13
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:32,910
Let's give 'em
a nice round of applause.

22

You're stiff.

23
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:08,079
Inarticulate.

24
00:01:08,273 --> 00:01:09,552
Slightly jaundiced.

25
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:10,954
Asymmetrical.

26
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:12,254
You smell.

27
00:01:12,377 --> 00:01:13,535
The one on the right...

28
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,881
there's something
in your teeth.

29
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:15,897
All in all, I'd say

30
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:17,342
there's absolutely
nothing worthwhile

31
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:18,759
about either one of you.

32
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:22,124
But we haven't even sang yet.

33
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:23,699
Apples and oranges.

34
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,874
Anybody else?

35
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:25,875
I like 'em.

36
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:27,236
Well, of course
you liked them.

37
00:01:27,318 --> 00:01:29,303
You've been asleep
for the last 45 minutes.

38
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:30,361
Zapato?

39
00:01:30,362 --> 00:01:30,800
Well, I...

40
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:31,460
Good.

41
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:32,461
Moving on.

42
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:34,494
Coming up after the break...

43
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:35,666
You see what I mean?
Shh!

44
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,095
You shooshing me
for reality TV?

45
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:39,079
Dude...
Zip!

46
00:01:39,193 --> 00:01:41,900
I'm Lester Beacon
and this is American Duos.

47
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,618
o/~ American Duos o/~

48
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:47,618
Rule number one, Shawn...

49
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,247
no talking during Duos.

50
00:01:49,356 --> 00:01:51,176
Oh, for the love
of Lori Loughlin.

51
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:53,780
Please use the pause button
just once.

52
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:56,497
Why did we get TiVo
if we never fast-forward

53
00:01:56,603 --> 00:01:58,167
and I can't stop
for commentary?

54
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:01,828
Whoa, no calls either.

55
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:04,519
Gus, don't be
a rabid porcupine.

56
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:06,558
This is just
another knockoff

57
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:08,398
of the other knockoff
of the original knockoff

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,399
of that other show.

59
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,323
o/~ And welcome back o/~
o/~ to American Duos. o/~

60
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:12,997
First of all, Shawn,
look at the guy

61
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:13,998
on the right.

62
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,245
o/~ American Duos o/~
Zapato?

63
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:17,556
He's not black.

64
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:18,790
He's Latino.

65
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,791
That's different.

66
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:22,016
The contestants in this one
are duos,

67
00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:23,532
which makes it
way more compelling.

68
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:25,794
They have to mesh,
become one soul.

69
00:02:25,894 --> 00:02:28,285
Like V'ger and Stephen Collins
in Star Trek I.

70
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,855
And they're shooting
in Santa Barbara this year,

71
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,745
which more than compensates.

72
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:35,619
Don't you dare answer that.

73
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:36,903
Dude, it's Jules.

74
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:38,085
She could be bleeding
and in a ditch.

75
00:02:38,086 --> 00:02:39,086
She's not bleeding.

76
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:39,935
She could be in a ditch.

77
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:40,733
She's not in a ditch.

78
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:41,691
She could be lonely
and in the shower.

79
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:42,564
She has a shower phone?

80
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:43,614
I certainly hope so.

81
00:02:43,702 --> 00:02:44,724
Dude, it's a win-win...

82
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:46,332
except for the ditch one.

83
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:48,283
Hello?

84
00:02:48,722 --> 00:02:50,707
Nothing... at all.

85
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:53,487
We'll be right there.

86
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:55,802
Shawn!

87
00:02:57,549 --> 00:02:58,331
That's it.

88
00:02:58,413 --> 00:02:59,425
I'm canceling the TiVo.

89
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:00,825
No more frame-by-frame.

90
00:03:00,924 --> 00:03:02,029
No more Ghost Cat.

91
00:03:02,104 --> 00:03:03,299
I recorded that
by accident.

92
00:03:03,374 --> 00:03:04,472
Then why didn't you erase it
for three months?

93
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:06,635
Fine, but I'm putting up
the official Burton Guster

94
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:07,378
spoiler alert.

95
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,913
Until I get back
and watch the recording,

96
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,295
nobody utters a word
about American Duos.

97
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:12,545
That's going to be difficult.

98
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:13,515
Why?

99
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:19,873
That's Nigel St. Nigel.

100
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:22,503
You know,
you were totally unfair

101
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,157
to Catherine Clement
in season two.

102
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:27,368
I don't remember the person
to whom you are referring.

103
00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:29,900
But she was hideous.

104
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:32,009
This is them?

105
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:34,881
Yes, this is Shawn Spencer
and Burton Guster...

106
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,394
our resident psychic team.

107
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:38,849
The answer is no.

108
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:42,403
Mr. St. Nigel, this is exactly
what you asked for.

109
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:43,547
Hear them out.

110
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:44,637
There's no reason.

111
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:49,050
Hear... them... out.

112
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:52,700
Nigel needs protection.

113
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,358
Do you realize
you're in a police station?

114
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,389
I don't trust the police.

115
00:03:56,721 --> 00:03:58,361
They're useless.

116
00:03:58,646 --> 00:03:59,669
No offense.

117
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:00,974
Oh, none taken.

118
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:02,638
Mr. St. Nigel has been
the victim

119
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:04,531
of a series of attempts
and threats on his life

120
00:04:04,532 --> 00:04:05,799
by a crazed stalker.

121
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:07,168
He believes that even
the police

122
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,663
could somehow be
in on the conspiracy

123
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:11,632
even though we've assured him
that...

124
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:13,823
I can speak for myself.

125
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:16,356
And stop slouching.

126
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:18,562
Every time I bring in
some sort

127
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,888
of professional protection
my attacker gets closer.

128
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:23,653
My car has been tampered with.

129
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:25,768
My trailer has been
broken into.

130
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:28,340
Accidents follow me everywhere.

131
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:31,949
What I need is someone
who can anticipate

132
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,921
my attacker's next move.

133
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:37,509
Someone who can move about
undetected.

134
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,897
You're talking about
a psychic.

135
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,247
Someone who can see danger
before it occurs.

136
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:44,065
Someone who can say,
"Nigel, duck!"

137
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,674
before the bullet
exits the chamber.

138
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:47,553
Spare me the theatrics.

139
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:49,872
Can you do it or not?

140
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:52,758
Look, we are asking you
to go undercover.

141
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,652
No one outside of this office
will know that

142
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:55,545
you're on the job.

143
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,080
What about Detective Lassiter?

144
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:00,874
Absolutely not.

145
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:03,052
His hair looks like
it's been poured

146
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:04,187
out of a cake mold.

147
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:08,060
Nigel, get ready
to feel safe.

148
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,675
Jules, I need complete access
to the theater.

149
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,495
Green rooms, air shafts,
spokesmodels...

150
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:13,874
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

151
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:15,265
We need to think this through.

152
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:16,294
Come up with a plan.

153
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:17,683
You'll need to blend.

154
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,533
Obviously the local police
already know you

155
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:20,454
so a false identity...

156
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:21,446
I already have a plan.

157
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,447
You have a plan?

158
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:23,804
What is it?

159
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:27,239
Oh, I'm sorry.

160
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:29,224
I thought you wanted us
to be stealth.

161
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:34,920
Bring on
the next contestants.

162
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:39,165
Presenting
Shawn Spence Starr

163
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,714
and Gus TT Showbizz.

164
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,953
Good luck, guys.

165
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:43,548
Hello.

166
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:49,164
So, what do you two hope
to get out of the competition?

167
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,873
Just hope to be here
long enough

168
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:52,100
to do something awesome.

169
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:56,515
Well, you know,
round one is the most...

170
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,519
Why don't you just
go ahead?

171
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:04,499

Well... that was, um...

186
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
something.

187
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:53,711
Something awesome.

188
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:54,968
Honestly, guys.

189
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:57,003
Bad news.

190
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,513
I mean, this is gonna hurt...

191
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:00,532
Although I do love
your style

192
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,208
because you both chose
to wear purple.

193
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:05,021
But I think we need
to be fort...

194
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:05,680
forth...

195
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,502
ford... forthright
in saying that...

196
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,757
That we cannot even begin
to understand

197
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,008
how brilliant that was.

198
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,554
What are you...

199
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:14,655
are you crazy?

200
00:07:14,798 --> 00:07:16,076
It was real.

201
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:17,394
It was rough.

202
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:21,642
Post-post-postmodern,
yet challenging.

203
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:24,801
Sandpaper-esque.

204
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:27,693
They weren't even singing
the same verse.

205
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,611
I'm voting no.

206
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:29,304
I'm voting yes.

207
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,488
Well, it's up to Zapato.

208
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:31,522
He votes yes.

209
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:32,600
He hasn't even spoken.

210
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:33,299
He doesn't need to.

211
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:33,919
Zapato?

212
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:34,689
Votes yes.

213
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:35,367
Come on!

214
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:36,849
Jam a cork in it,
Lester.

215
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:37,940
We're moving on.
Oh...

216
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,974
Nigel,
we all saw what happened

217
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:41,537
with the Indian kid
on that other show and...

218
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:42,114
Next!

219
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:43,241
Look out!

220
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:51,192
Ahem... sweet!

221
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,517

230
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:18,047
Lester, this is ludicrous!

231
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:20,069
I almost died...
again!

232
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:21,649
Oh, it was an accident!

233
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,200
Any fool could see that.

234
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,783
We've had too many
costly delays already.

235
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:26,070
You're paranoid, Nigel!

236
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:27,592
That thing could've
almost landed

237
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:28,460
on any one of us.

238
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:29,588
But it didn't, Lester.

239
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,268
It landed on me!

240
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:33,614
You daft punk!

241
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,479
Have you guys gone
completely insane?

242
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:43,213
No.

243
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:44,382
What was that?

244
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:45,817
Us advancing
to the next round.

245
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,465
You got half the words wrong!

246
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,315
Jules, those A-ha guys
are Norwegian.

247
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:51,726
They didn't even know
what they were singing.

248
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:53,261
What are you planning on singing
for round two?

249
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:54,867
Yankee Rose,
David Lee Roth.

250
00:08:55,498 --> 00:08:56,055
What?

251
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:57,205
Too obvious?

252
00:08:57,214 --> 00:08:59,198
No... Gus can sing
the guitar part.

253
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,620
Guys, if you're gonna stay
in this competition,

254
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,680
you're gonna need
to step it up... way up.

255
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,359
Now, I have to go.

256
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:06,727
I can't be seen talking to you.

257
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:09,887
And not just because
you're undercover.

258
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,835
Well, Nigel's essentially
a monster.

259
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:16,656
He's an equal-opportunity
bastard.

260
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,271
The list of suspects
can be narrowed down

261
00:09:18,272 --> 00:09:19,138
to everybody.

262
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,192
Even I kind of want
to kill him.

263
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:21,500
So where does that leave us?

264
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,143
Well, there have been
at least nine incidents

265
00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:25,023
that can be counted
as attempts on his life...

266
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:26,400
in nine different cities.

267
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,043
We have to assume it's someone
who's here every week.

268
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:28,629
Great.

269
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,800
No, not great.

270
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,476
That only narrows it down
to crew, security, and fans.

271
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:34,338
Most of which
are pretty die-hard.

272
00:09:34,444 --> 00:09:35,782
We're gonna have to talk
to everybody,

273
00:09:35,902 --> 00:09:37,662
which is gonna be difficult,
because I think

274
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm developing a polyp.

275
00:09:39,134 --> 00:09:47,344
o/~ Eee-e o/~
o/~ Ah-a-ah o/~

276
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,615
I'm Shawn Spence Starr.

277
00:09:52,854 --> 00:09:55,245
This is my partner,
Gus TT Showbizz.

278
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:56,903
The extra T
is for extra talent.

279
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:58,403
We just advanced
to the second round.

280
00:09:58,471 --> 00:09:59,764
Congratulations!

281
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:00,948
Bevin.

282
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:02,570
Bevin Rennie Llywellen.

283
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:03,690
I'm next, I think.

284
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:05,390
I think you got us beat
with that name already.

285
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:09,459
Where's your partner?

286
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,573
I got rid of him.

287
00:10:10,956 --> 00:10:12,851
I sing both parts.

288
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,147
The show's called
American Duos.

289
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:16,237
It's my hook.

290
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:17,916
Everyone needs a thing,
right?

291
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:19,476
I learned that last year.

292
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:20,813
Good luck, dudes.

293
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:24,438
He did it.

294
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:25,320
Him?

295
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,878
You talk to one dude
and you're done?

296
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:29,055
His name
is Bevin Rennie Llywellen.

297
00:10:32,822 --> 00:10:33,822
We made it!

298
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,868
Hey, you fellow winners!

299
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:37,989
Chance Cade.

300
00:10:38,077 --> 00:10:39,619
This here's my brother
Rance.

301
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:41,706
We just made it
to the next round too.

302
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:45,115
Rance... nice.

303
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:47,405
Nigel just called us
a curious cocktail

304
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:49,353
of inbreeding
and type 2 diabetes.

305
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:51,368
But then he passed us through
anyway.

306
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:53,719
That's hitting
below the belt.

307
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:54,796
Yeah, well...

308
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,977
Australian people are mean.

309
00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:00,314
Let's go.

310
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,167
I was wrong,
they did it.

311
00:11:05,242 --> 00:11:06,242
Shawn.

312
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,131
The stalker could've accessed
the fallen light

313
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:23,980
from up here.

314
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:25,180
He sure could've.

315
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:35,909
You supposed to be
up here?

316
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:38,811
Define "supposed to be. "

317
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:45,921
How do you expect me

318
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:49,200
to carry you two howler monkeys
through tomorrow?

319
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,988
Well, I might've been
a little pitchy.

320
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,013
I had a dairy-heavy
Jamba Juice.

321
00:11:53,118 --> 00:11:54,369
Stop the excuses.

322
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,370
Step it up!

323
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:57,792
I cannot carry you
through another round.

324
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,326
I think I preferred
the stalker.

325
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:01,949
Don't.

326
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,988
Don't what?

327
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:05,284
Uh... smoke.

328
00:12:05,314 --> 00:12:06,314
Those things'll kill you.

329
00:12:06,382 --> 00:12:07,765
Well, add them to the list.

330
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:15,660
Stop!

331
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:20,202
I do not have physical contact
with people with arm hair!

332
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,364
That case...

333
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,277
Was a gift from Les McKeown
of the Bay City Rollers.

334
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,350
It's a very expensive bla...

335
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:37,800
How many do we got, officer?

336
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,237
A lot... you're sure
that you wanted

337
00:12:39,313 --> 00:12:40,306
everybody who was
in the building?

338
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,572
Well, that's what I said,
isn't it?

339
00:12:41,632 --> 00:12:42,964
Everybody inside,
everybody outside.

340
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:43,716
It's attempted murder.

341
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:44,830
I'm not screwing around here.

342
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:45,348
Okay, but...

343
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:47,348
Just stop talking
and open the door, please.

344
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:50,287
Really, McNab,
you might want to open

345
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:51,144
your ears for once.

346
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:52,333
You could learn...

347
00:12:56,546 --> 00:12:58,200
Go get me some coffee.

348
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:01,373
Great.

349
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,035
What are you two doing
down at that competion?

350
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:04,333
We're looking
for our big break.

351
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,473
Do I get a phone call?

352
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:08,542
No, I am trying
to conduct an investigation.

353
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:09,393
Out!

354
00:13:09,394 --> 00:13:10,786
Don't you want to ask us
if we did it?

355
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:11,507
Ask him.

356
00:13:11,508 --> 00:13:12,711
I plead the Fifth.

357
00:13:17,979 --> 00:13:19,543
What's happening,
undercover partner?

358
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:22,305
No public discussion
of your undercover business.

359
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:23,444
We need a choreographer.

360
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:24,678
You need a choreographer.

361
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:26,255
You both have many needs, so...

362
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,604
So I'm getting
a very strong vibration

363
00:13:28,694 --> 00:13:29,732
that you can dance.

364
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:32,117
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

365
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:37,850
Well, I did go
to cheerleader camp.

366
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:39,252
For two weeks.

367
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:40,299
I got kicked out.

368
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:40,963
Kicked out?

369
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:41,999
Yeah, it's a long story.

370
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,373
Suffice to say
I don't like liars

371
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,711
who steal nail polish
and then pass out

372
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:45,746
when you slap 'em
a little bit

373
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:47,424
on the back of the head.

374
00:13:49,303 --> 00:13:50,732
Jules, listen...

375
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:53,063
I can feel in my heart
that you can get

376
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:54,163
into the groove.

377
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:55,518
Now, we need to step it up,
literally.

378
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,274
And we need to stomp the yard...

379
00:13:57,377 --> 00:13:58,377
figuratively.

380
00:13:58,478 --> 00:13:59,630
We've advanced to round two.

381
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:01,375
This is an elite class
of performer.

382
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:03,714
Shawn, 97 teams have advanced
to round two.

383
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:04,611
We're out of time.

384
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:05,436
You're all we've got.

385
00:14:05,437 --> 00:14:06,483
Everything's riding on this!

386
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:08,033
Step up to the plate!

387
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:11,644
Guys.

388
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:16,436
Sit.

389
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:18,598
Okay, look...

390
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,374
the only time
I have ever danced publicly

391
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:22,241
was in a high school performance
of Everybody Hip-Hop!

392
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:24,334
which closed after
two performances.

393
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:26,665
Jules, all we do is argue.

394
00:14:26,762 --> 00:14:27,860
Gus is very stubborn.

395
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:29,350
We need a guiding force.

396
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:30,755
A Svengali, if you will.

397
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,754
Shawn, I'm a detective,
not a Svengali.

398
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:33,132
Jules...

399
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,494
Shawn, I think I would know
if I were a Svengali.

400
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:37,308
Fine.

401
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:39,124
Whatever.

402
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:41,335
I guess my heart vibes
are jammed.

403
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:43,354
Never mind.

404
00:14:51,371 --> 00:14:52,371
Wait.

405
00:14:52,612 --> 00:14:54,236
So what exactly do you do
on the show,

406
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:54,960
Zappito?

407
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:55,961
Zapato.

408
00:14:56,321 --> 00:14:57,450
It's immaterial.

409
00:14:58,151 --> 00:14:59,264
I'm a judge.

410
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:01,100
What kind of judge?

411
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,105
A talent judge...

412
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:04,610
on camera.

413
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:06,085
Sit on the far left.

414
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:07,513
Really?

415
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:09,977
Have you seen the show?

416
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,818
Yeah, a hundred times.

417
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:11,826
I'm sure I would've
remembered you.

418
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:15,287
I can't believe this.

419
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:17,618
I was the first person
hired for the show.

420
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:19,496
My first record went gold.

421
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,998
o/~ Mira me o/~

422
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,810
Well, you are spinning yourself

423
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:25,983
into circles,
whoever you are.

424
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:27,667
Maybe you should go outside
and rethink your story.

425
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:28,529
What story?

426
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,530
Exactly.

427
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:31,668
Get him out of here.

428
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:35,848
Keep an eye on that one.

429
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:38,282
Who's next?

430
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:42,055
Yeah, great,
the Bride of Frankenstein.

431
00:15:42,161 --> 00:15:43,168
Have a seat.

432
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:46,489
What am I doing here?

433
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:47,820
Well, let's see.

434
00:15:48,535 --> 00:15:50,701
Your trailer's
right next to Nigel's.

435
00:15:50,702 --> 00:15:51,593
You hate him.

436
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:53,127
And you can't seem to account
for your whereabouts

437
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,827
for most of the last 60 days.

438
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:56,391
Everybody hates Nigel.

439
00:15:56,482 --> 00:15:57,970
And Everybody Loves Raymond.

440
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:00,545
But everybody doesn't have
a vacant sense of morality

441
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,650
and an assault with a deadly
weapon charge on their record.

442
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,569
That was a publicity stunt.

443
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:08,367
The "weapon" was a forklift
and I was drunk

444
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:10,096
on a spray bottle
of Charlie.

445
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:12,462
Well, I'm gonna need
some answers, and fast.

446
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,372
Otherwise you and I are gonna
turn on the hot lights,

447
00:16:14,462 --> 00:16:16,703
do the "Lindsay Hop"
and see who cracks first.

448
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,733
Now you're trying
to seduce me.

449
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,724
I never thought
I would make this sound

450
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,430
in my lifetime,
but... ew.

451
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:28,554
You left me alone
half the day.

452
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,510
You were at a police station.

453
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:33,533
You'll never make it
as bodyguards.

454
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:34,900
We're not bodyguards.

455
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,794
You'll never make it
as anything.

456
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:41,699
Oh, thank God!

457
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:43,355
I'm starving.

458
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:46,329
What do you got there?

459
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,426
My standing order.

460
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:54,050
Wait!

461
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:56,275
Give it back!

462
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:57,000
No.

463
00:16:57,456 --> 00:16:58,689
Give it back!

464
00:16:58,781 --> 00:16:59,781
No.

465
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:03,711
What is it with you
and throwing things?

466
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Don't eat that!

467
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:06,789
Why the devil not?

468
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:09,198
'Cause I'm getting
a very strong feeling

469
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:10,410
about this sandwich.

470
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:11,205
It's...

471
00:17:11,206 --> 00:17:11,956
Delicious?

472
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:12,326
No.

473
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:12,938
Herb-crusted?

474
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:13,420
No!

475
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,153
It's not from
the hotel kitchen.

476
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:17,777
And?

477
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:19,047
And...

478
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:20,999
it's poisoned.

479
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,060
Well, it stings, but it looks
like Spencer was right.

480
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,752
According to the toxicology
reports,

481
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:32,278
there's enough drugs
to kill a Clydesdale

482
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:33,827
in that tuna Nicoise salad
sandwich.

483
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:36,897
You see, your hotel detail
couldn't even manage

484
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:37,890
one room.

485
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,222
Well, pardon me,
but I'm not the one

486
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,107
out ordering room service
with a big target

487
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:43,014
painted on my back.

488
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:45,045
It was a standing order!

489
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,447
We're almost through
with the screen

490
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:47,720
of your room, Mr. St. Nigel.

491
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,034
You can return
when we clear it.

492
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:51,202
Fantastic,
because to be honest,

493
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,227
Gus and I have
slightly more pressing issues

494
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:54,317
at the moment.

495
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:55,700
We need to rehearse.

496
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,468
How did you know
that sandwich

497
00:17:57,469 --> 00:17:58,399
didn't come from
the kitchen?

498
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,580
Easy, there were only
83 sesame seeds on his bun.

499
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,535
All the other ones
from the hotel have 87.

500
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,225
Are you serious?
No.

501
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:05,659
The other ones have swords.

502
00:18:05,764 --> 00:18:06,967
Nigel's had a tooth pick.

503
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:08,064
I'm not Rain Man, Gus.

504
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,346
You sing like Rain Man.

505
00:18:09,347 --> 00:18:10,288
Spencer!

506
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,331
You missed something...

507
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:12,610
we found prints.

508
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,518
Was he in
a little red corvette?

509
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:15,697
Under the cherry moon?

510
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,291
Fingerprints!

511
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,704
They belong
to Emilina Saffron.

512
00:18:18,794 --> 00:18:20,494
So do the drugs
we found in the food.

513
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:22,012
Cross-referenced them
with her prescriptions

514
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:22,956
and her medical records.

515
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:24,647
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go get

516
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:25,723
a warrant.

517
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:28,221
Emilina?

518
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:33,491
Where am I?

519
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:37,023
Hello?

520
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:38,755
Hey, I need my bag!

521
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:45,387
Mr. Bean.

522
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,349
Thank God it's you.

523
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:51,424
I really need my bag,
please.

524
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:53,920
And I need a confession.

525
00:18:55,243 --> 00:18:57,138
I have a kid in Milwaukee.

526
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,717
The father's Samoan.

527
00:18:59,168 --> 00:19:01,979
Can I now please have my bag,
Tony Randall?

528
00:19:04,671 --> 00:19:07,002
I was thinking something
more along the lines of...

529
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:09,664
"I tried to kill
Nigel St. Nigel

530
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:11,363
"by poisoning
his tuna Nicoise salad sandwich

531
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:12,987
"with a dangerous cocktail
of prescription medications

532
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:14,580
I happen to carry with me
at all times. "

533
00:19:15,483 --> 00:19:16,483
Unquote.

534
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,467
I have no idea
what you just said.

535
00:19:20,971 --> 00:19:23,489
You're an even worse liar
than my ex-wife.

536
00:19:24,271 --> 00:19:25,384
Ex-wife?

537
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,136
Well, I mean,
we're separated.

538
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:32,020
So what you're trying
to tell me

539
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:33,800
is that you got
a little hole in your heart?

540
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:35,479
Come on.

541
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,223
Fill it with Saffron.

542
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:39,471
Okay... you know,
I'm gonna go get a bite.

543
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,291
And, uh, you think long and hard
about what you did.

544
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,764
And I'll come back, say,
sometime tomorrow afternoon.

545
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:47,182
I need my bag!

546
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:48,927
Oh, I know.

547
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:50,220
Don't worry.

548
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:51,634
I'll take good care of it.

549
00:19:53,355 --> 00:19:54,949
No, I need my bag now!

550
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,040
I don't know,
Detective.

551
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:01,687
Oh, come on.

552
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:02,725
Please don't tell me
you're buying

553
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:04,004
this dog and pony show.

554
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:05,922
It's an act.

555
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:07,424
It's the perfect cover-up.

556
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:08,852
Well, it's pretty convincing.

557
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:09,949
Oh, she's good.

558
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,950
But I'm better.

559
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:13,687
I'm gonna crack her
like a bad back.

560
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,028
Please don't.

561
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,309
Mr. Bean, I need my bag.

562
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:26,652

00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,598
Damn, girl!

568
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:49,982
It's okay, Jules.

569
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:52,063
You can be straight with us.

570
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:53,064
We can handle it.

571
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:53,843
Really?

572
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:55,047
'Cause that was awful.

573
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:55,971
Awful?

574
00:20:55,972 --> 00:20:57,371
Can I teach you
how to krump?

575
00:20:57,593 --> 00:20:58,593
Maybe.

576
00:20:58,648 --> 00:20:59,800
That's up to you.

577
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:03,700
But I can't reach inside of you
and make you want this.

578
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:06,121
I mean, absolutely need this.

579
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:09,451
The way that both Hall and Oates
used to need it.

580
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,252
Well, Oates a little bit more,
probably.

581
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:17,237
This has to come from inside here.

582
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:21,492
And deep, deep, deep...

583
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,144
inside here.

584
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:26,884
Jules.

585
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:31,912
You do realize that there is
a suspect in custody

586
00:21:31,993 --> 00:21:33,617
and the case is just about closed.

587
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:35,160
Is that what this laissez-faire,

588
00:21:35,214 --> 00:21:37,384
half-baked effort
is about, huh... the case?

589
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:39,278
I thought you were in it to win it!

590
00:21:41,273 --> 00:21:42,437
Jules, are you feeling okay?

591
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:43,516
Sharp as cheddar.

592
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:47,251
You know, I wouldn't put all my eggs
in Emilina's basket, Shawn.

593
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:49,314
She's barely lucid enough
to form word endings,

594
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:51,723
much less plan a series
of attacks on Nigel's life.

595
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,534
She could be like Keyser Soze.

596
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:54,542
With one shoe.

597
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:55,543
I think...

598
00:21:56,305 --> 00:21:57,735
until we get a confession,

599
00:21:58,046 --> 00:21:59,900
we gotta keep our eyes on the prize.

600
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:04,250
Now let's take it back to
the broken melting robot, huh?

601
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:06,797
Gus... watch me!

602
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:10,680

00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,036

00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,207
Took you long enough.

606
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:37,825
I assumed that you were dead.

607
00:22:39,978 --> 00:22:41,393
You see what I'm reduced to?

608
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:44,732
I can't even eat real food.

609
00:22:45,088 --> 00:22:47,078
I'll take the noodles
if you don't want them.

614
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:20,862
Is something burning in here?

615
00:23:23,177 --> 00:23:24,177
What is that?

616
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,850
You all right?

617
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:41,096
Peachy.

618
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:43,536
Now let me go.

619
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:48,385
Are we there yet?

620
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:53,876
I feel like I've been incarcerated

621
00:23:53,947 --> 00:23:55,305
in a blueberry.

622
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:56,311
Shawn.

623
00:23:56,312 --> 00:23:58,132
This car makes me want to weep

624
00:23:58,288 --> 00:23:59,512
and then die.

625
00:23:59,702 --> 00:24:00,876
Shawn!

626
00:24:01,326 --> 00:24:02,423
Nigel? You asked for a safe house

627
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,142
where absolutely no one can find you.

628
00:24:04,213 --> 00:24:07,156
That means we have to venture off
the beaten path just a little.

629
00:24:07,485 --> 00:24:08,485
Relax.

630
00:24:18,593 --> 00:24:19,866
Good Lord!

631
00:24:20,386 --> 00:24:21,405
Who lives here?

632
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:23,234
The Boringtons?

633
00:24:23,784 --> 00:24:26,176
There's a better-than-decent
chance this goes poorly.

634
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:27,775
I don't care. I'm starving.

635
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:35,767
Wait!

636
00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:38,858
Hey, I remember something!

637
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:40,955
Hurry up, I'm lucid.

638
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:43,751
I'm not kidding. Come in here
right now and bring my bag.

639
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,303
Hello?

640
00:24:47,835 --> 00:24:48,835
Come on!

641
00:24:48,944 --> 00:24:50,041
Come on, Count Chocula!

642
00:24:50,112 --> 00:24:51,329
I know you're in there!

643
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:54,070
Don't make me pee on something.

644
00:24:54,357 --> 00:24:55,357
Again!

645
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:00,531
Well, it took you long enough,
I'm dying in here.

646
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,605
Yeah, it's called with drawal.

647
00:25:01,606 --> 00:25:02,766
Are you ready to confess?

648
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,479
No, see, that's the thing.

649
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,341
First of all, I remember somebody
getting into my purse yesterday.

650
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:09,542
When?

651
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,322
I don't remember, but I was sleeping,

652
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:13,685
and they were diggin' around
in my purse right in front of me.

653
00:25:13,756 --> 00:25:14,789
Well, who was it?

654
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:17,045
I can't be sure.

655
00:25:18,204 --> 00:25:19,732
I thought I was dreaming.

656
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,195
But it might've been
a werewolf.

657
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:23,867
Might've been?

658
00:25:23,966 --> 00:25:25,395
Yes, and another thing...

659
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,659
I wasn't even at the hotel
this morning!

660
00:25:27,815 --> 00:25:30,560
I slept on a car
in the parking lot.

661
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:32,524
That makes me innocent.

662
00:25:32,637 --> 00:25:33,783
You slept on a car?

663
00:25:34,264 --> 00:25:35,264
Well, yeah.

664
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:36,454
It... it's a long story.

665
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,284
I usually sleep in
the lifeguard station,

666
00:25:39,376 --> 00:25:41,216
but I didn't want
to make a scene, so...

667
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:43,999
Your fingerprints
are all over Nigel's room.

668
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,016
We hook up sometimes.

669
00:25:46,172 --> 00:25:48,974
I went to his room yesterday
to see if he was lonely.

670
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:51,159
It was a moment of weakness.

671
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,427
A girl's got needs.

672
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:01,747
All right, gentlemen.

673
00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:04,606
Prepare to taste the most succulent,

674
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:08,787
evenly-marinated beef
that you have ev...

675
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,963
Is that my robe?

676
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,923
It is indeed, Horace.

677
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,679
And it is comforting me
at an elite spa level.

678
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,868
I think I should also point out
that I'm absolutely famished and

679
00:26:23,688 --> 00:26:26,150
thoses filets actually
smell promising.

680
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,150
Sweet.

681
00:26:27,151 --> 00:26:28,500
That's what I'm talking about.

682
00:26:28,606 --> 00:26:29,606
It's Henry.

683
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,300
They're rib eyes.

684
00:26:34,546 --> 00:26:35,988
Is there a problem?

685
00:26:35,989 --> 00:26:36,989
Well, look at it.

686
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:40,026
It's still got the marks where
the jockey was hitting it.

687
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,403
You're free.

688
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:47,558
Parking lot attendants
confirmed your alibi.

689
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,896
So I can go?

690
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:51,800
The sooner the better.

691
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:55,806
And for God's sakes,
take a shower.

692
00:26:56,752 --> 00:26:58,393
I'll never forget you.

693
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:00,607
What was your name again?

694
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:06,350
Nose hair trimmer.

695
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,058
Invest.

696
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:10,351
Can you even remember what
it felt like to be able to move

697
00:27:10,436 --> 00:27:11,701
the muscles in your face?

698
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:13,974
Who decorated this place?

699
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:15,606
Kris Kristofferson?

700
00:27:15,712 --> 00:27:17,473
Is that... damn!

701
00:27:17,923 --> 00:27:18,999
I built that table.

702
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,050
Really?

703
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,305
I'm pretty sure
if I were to build a table,

704
00:27:22,424 --> 00:27:25,240
I would start by using wood
that had never drifted.

705
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,504
All right, you know... That's it.

706
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,761
Already?
I'm just getting started.

707
00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:31,738
I've got a sonnet for each piece
of fish paraphernalia.

708
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:33,725
Oh, yeah?
Well I got an ice-cold can of whip-ass

709
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:34,898
just sitting in that fridge!

710
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:36,668
Actually, that's diet whip-ass.

711
00:27:37,138 --> 00:27:38,138
Yeah!

712
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:39,356
You must be out of your damn mind!

713
00:27:39,444 --> 00:27:40,732
Dude, you have three full cobs!

714
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:41,963
I will slap you, Shawn.

715
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:43,071
Now, tell me...

716
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:46,294
are you absolutely certain
that this cow shoulder on my plate

717
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:47,539
is in fact dead?

718
00:27:47,586 --> 00:27:48,586
I'm just asking.

719
00:27:48,713 --> 00:27:49,888
That's it, take off the robe!

720
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:51,077
Wearing that robe is a privilege

721
00:27:51,162 --> 00:27:52,660
and you, pal, have just lost it!

722
00:27:52,753 --> 00:27:54,446
I stead fastly refuse.

723
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:57,335
This is the plushiest,
most opulent robe

724
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,014
I've ever had
the pleasure of wearing.

725
00:27:59,113 --> 00:28:00,330
Well, there's one thing
we could agree on.

726
00:28:00,415 --> 00:28:01,542
Now give it up.

727
00:28:01,543 --> 00:28:02,543
No.

728
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:07,549
I feel like an angel baby
swaddled in a cocoon

729
00:28:07,637 --> 00:28:08,978
of cloud candy.

730
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:11,028
You either take it off,
or I'll take it off for you.

731
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:12,437
Dad, I don't think
you're thinking this through.

732
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:13,438
Shawn!

733
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:15,647
Dad, I'm pretty sure he's
going commando under...

734
00:28:15,648 --> 00:28:16,648
Keep playin', Shawn.

735
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:17,471
Go ahead.

736
00:28:17,472 --> 00:28:19,184
What kind of sick bastard
goes commando

737
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:20,629
underneath another man's robe?

738
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,238
All right, all right. All right!

739
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:24,710
Come with me. Come with me!

740
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:25,725
Come on!

741
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:27,424
Dad, just walk it off.

742
00:28:28,718 --> 00:28:30,869
He's not staying here.
He violated basic robe code.

743
00:28:30,952 --> 00:28:32,184
Robe code violation...
check.

744
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:34,067
Look, Shawn, there's a reason
this guy's on the run.

745
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,865
He's been here ten minutes,
even I want to kill him!

746
00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:38,129
That's the problem, Dad.
How do I protect him from everybody?

747
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,531
You've already got
a suspect in jail.

748
00:28:39,658 --> 00:28:41,350
She was just released.
Now we have a plethora of suspects

749
00:28:41,435 --> 00:28:43,600
and no way to narrow them down.
- It's easy, tighten your focus.

750
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,016
Who does he victimize
the most?

751
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:48,001
Is that peach cobbler
in the fridge for everybody?

752
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,568
I'm sorry.

753
00:28:50,752 --> 00:28:51,785
Not today.

754
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,209
I don't think so.

755
00:28:54,228 --> 00:28:55,228
I showed him!

756
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,400
It'll all go away.

757
00:28:58,218 --> 00:28:59,380
You think it's funny?

758
00:29:01,214 --> 00:29:02,714
Nigel!

759
00:29:03,163 --> 00:29:04,988
Naughty!

760
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:09,110
I hope you have some food in there.

761
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:27,099
Mr. Spencer, Mr. Guster, I'm afraid
I have some unfortunate news.

762
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:29,038
Emilina Saffron was found
in the bathroom

763
00:29:29,137 --> 00:29:30,427
of her hotel suite this morning.

764
00:29:30,512 --> 00:29:32,040
She was clinging to life
and has been rushed

765
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:33,568
to St. Thomas of the Apostles.

766
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,413
And so far all signs point to
an overdose of some sort.

767
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:38,467
But we are fully investigating
the matter.

768
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:39,557
Overdose?

769
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:41,586
She injected herself
with enough tranquilizers

770
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,156
to kill an adult rhinoceros.

771
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:44,558
But how did she escape?

772
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,158
Mr. St. Nigel, Ms. Saffron was
released this morning

773
00:29:48,229 --> 00:29:49,650
after her alibi checked out.

774
00:29:49,757 --> 00:29:52,239
She is the last person that you should
be worried about now.

775
00:29:52,322 --> 00:29:53,611
We have to cancel the show.

776
00:29:53,724 --> 00:29:54,869
Are you kidding?

777
00:29:54,977 --> 00:29:57,772
Look, I don't want to seem insensitive,
but this is the third time this season

778
00:29:57,871 --> 00:29:59,045
she's been in the ICU.

779
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,340
Not like this.

780
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:01,914
I will not go on.

781
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:03,986
I'll be a sitting duck out there.

782
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:07,332
I will personally oversee
your security detail, Mr. St. Nigel.

783
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:08,734
We'll all be out there
together.

784
00:30:08,735 --> 00:30:09,735
You'll be just fine.

785
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:10,736
Suck it up.

786
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:12,799
Now I gotta bolt.
I'm way late for my Pilates.

787
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,471
Lester Beacon sure didn't seem
too broken up about Emilina.

788
00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:22,502
He sure didn't.

789
00:30:22,503 --> 00:30:23,503
Plus, his hair.

790
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:25,758
Shawn, we're in a hallway...

791
00:30:25,851 --> 00:30:28,100
staying close to the wall
doesn't make us invisible.

792
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:30,846
Agree to disagree.

793
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:35,364
You have a plan yet?

794
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:36,822
Gus, I'm a lyrical gangster.

795
00:30:37,105 --> 00:30:38,461
I'll use some colorful vernacular

796
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,099
and if necessary,
you'll engage in fisticuffs.

797
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,609
That was close.

798
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:02,772
Too close.

799
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:10,048
No guard.

800
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:11,673
We did all that sneaking around because

801
00:31:11,758 --> 00:31:14,308
you thought they put a guard
at Emilina's empty hotel room?

802
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:15,763
Seemed like a decent theory at the time.

803
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:17,300
You better have the key.

804
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:23,818
What are we looking for?

805
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:25,252
Beats me.

806
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:29,437
Damn.

807
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:30,916
Seems clean.

808
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,419
That's what you get
for drinking whole milk, Shawn.

809
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,122
Dude, I have bones like granite.

810
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:09,876
And we just got ourselves
a clue.

811
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,264
What is it?

812
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,364
I don't know.

813
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:15,811
Reach in there and fish it out.

814
00:32:15,812 --> 00:32:16,900
I'm not putting my hand in there.

815
00:32:16,912 --> 00:32:17,912
You do it.

816
00:32:17,913 --> 00:32:19,307
Gus, I found it. You get it.

817
00:32:19,308 --> 00:32:20,308
That's how it works.

818
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:23,887
I'm not putting my hand in
Emilina Saffron's toilet water, Shawn.

819
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:31,019
Jules!

820
00:32:31,236 --> 00:32:33,273
I'm getting some really serious
vibrations here.

821
00:32:33,358 --> 00:32:34,972
They're coming from
Emilina's hotel room.

822
00:32:35,097 --> 00:32:37,230
You gotta get us in there
as soon as possible.

823
00:32:37,377 --> 00:32:38,632
Oh, and, uh... Bring gloves.

824
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:43,833
Oh, my God!

825
00:32:44,328 --> 00:32:45,687
It's just as I imagined.

826
00:32:46,863 --> 00:32:48,861
Oh, I am feeling something in here.

827
00:32:48,862 --> 00:32:49,862
Right here?

828
00:32:49,863 --> 00:32:50,868
Did you bring the gloves?

829
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:52,458
Yeah, I brought the gloves.
Why do I need gloves?

830
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:55,668
I feel... a sparkle.

831
00:32:57,249 --> 00:32:58,249
That!

832
00:33:03,246 --> 00:33:05,595
Wow, Shawn, that's amazing.

833
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:07,043
How did you know that?

834
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:10,421
I feel things... deeply.

835
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:11,638
Yeah.

836
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:17,997
I need to speak with
Emilina right away.

837
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:19,528
She's mostly comatose, Shawn.

838
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:21,520
We probably won't know
the difference.

839
00:33:21,629 --> 00:33:22,629
All right.

840
00:33:23,951 --> 00:33:24,951
Dude!

841
00:33:26,257 --> 00:33:27,602
That crystal was on the...
- I know!

842
00:33:27,687 --> 00:33:29,081
Go back to the office, see if
you can get some info on him.

843
00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:30,186
Right.

844
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:37,611
Knock, knock!
You have a visitor.

845
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:38,916
What is Spencer doing here?

846
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:40,555
Look, I insisted.

847
00:33:41,676 --> 00:33:43,473
Emilina's my favorite judge.

848
00:33:45,097 --> 00:33:47,673
I used to have such a crush on her
in high school.

849
00:33:48,168 --> 00:33:50,913
You know, before she started
eating glue and what not.

850
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,925
Has she said anything?

851
00:33:54,193 --> 00:33:55,193
No.

852
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:56,212
Not yet.

853
00:33:56,485 --> 00:33:59,273
But I will be right here when
she does. I can tell you that.

854
00:33:59,655 --> 00:34:00,655
That's...

855
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:02,991
very gentle.

856
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:06,462
I mis judged her.

857
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:08,868
She was innocent.

858
00:34:09,432 --> 00:34:11,739
Crying out for help
in her own sad,

859
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:13,904
potentially disease-ridden way.

860
00:34:14,372 --> 00:34:15,617
I cut her off at the arms.

861
00:34:15,759 --> 00:34:18,193
Judged the book by its filthy,
loathsome...

862
00:34:19,269 --> 00:34:20,798
wickedly erotic cover.

863
00:34:23,118 --> 00:34:24,137
Look at me!

864
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:26,418
I'm here, baby.

865
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,272
Look...

866
00:34:32,385 --> 00:34:33,418
at me!

867
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,628
I think she's trying
to tell us something.

868
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:44,087
That someone's looking at her?

869
00:34:45,021 --> 00:34:46,400
I was looking at her.

870
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:50,999
I should take this.

871
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,942
Get ready to be happy, Shawn.

872
00:34:55,943 --> 00:34:56,943
Did you find him?

873
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,169
I didn't just find him.

874
00:34:58,282 --> 00:35:01,650
I found him, found him,
found him, and found him.

875
00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:03,599
I knew this dude looked familiar.

876
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,644
He's been at every stage
of the competion,

877
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,689
in every city, doing his best
William Hung at every stop.

878
00:35:08,793 --> 00:35:10,558
Okay, let's try that again,
and leave out the reference

879
00:35:10,657 --> 00:35:11,761
you know means nothing to me.

880
00:35:11,888 --> 00:35:13,758
He's singing badly
on purpose, Shawn,

881
00:35:13,885 --> 00:35:15,781
knowing full well
he wouldn't advance.

882
00:35:15,894 --> 00:35:18,045
That way he could re-enter
the competition

883
00:35:18,148 --> 00:35:19,889
in every city at every stop.

884
00:35:19,996 --> 00:35:21,115
That's nefarious.

885
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,587
But he couldn't have done this
on his own.

886
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:24,779
Now we just have to figure out
who's helping him

887
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:26,242
from the inside.

888
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,145
Emilina just said, "Look at me"
from her hospital bed.

889
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:30,146
How does that help us?

890
00:35:30,147 --> 00:35:31,147
Dude...

891
00:35:31,802 --> 00:35:32,802
Look at me!

892
00:35:33,978 --> 00:35:34,978
Wait!

893
00:35:42,734 --> 00:35:44,871
Ten-year-old Bevin Rennie Llywellen?

894
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:46,078
What the...

895
00:35:47,198 --> 00:35:48,198
Oh, my God!

896
00:35:48,203 --> 00:35:49,406
What? What?
We have a match?

897
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,873
o/~ There's a yellow rose of Texas o/~

898
00:35:55,227 --> 00:35:56,968
o/~ That I'm going to see o/~

899
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,734
o/~ No other soldier knows her o/~

900
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:04,582
o/~ No soldier, only me o/~
o/~ She cried so when I left her o/~

901
00:36:13,312 --> 00:36:14,801
Please, accept our apologies.

902
00:36:14,912 --> 00:36:16,199
We just thought you all
might want to know

903
00:36:16,298 --> 00:36:19,624
that you're in the presence
of a homicidal sociopath.

904
00:36:20,696 --> 00:36:22,182
No, no, no! He's not crazy.

905
00:36:22,366 --> 00:36:24,625
No, we got a doctor's note
and everything.

906
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,677
Nigel!

907
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:35,640
Just, um... dropped some... items.

908
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,715
Chief, so glad you're here.

909
00:36:39,012 --> 00:36:41,121
I know who's been
trying to kill Nigel.

910
00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:44,191
And who was trying
to take out Emilina.

911
00:36:47,194 --> 00:36:49,578
And who tried
to take out Emilina.

912
00:36:49,663 --> 00:36:51,616
Mr. Spencer,
last time I checked,

913
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:55,748
Emilina overdosed on her own
prescription medication.

914
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:59,172
That's precisely what
Bevin Rennie Llywellen

915
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:00,536
wanted you to think.

916
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:02,304
That's really his name?

917
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:04,525
That's the wanker who auditioned
in every city.

918
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:06,690
Just another slice
of deception.

919
00:37:06,988 --> 00:37:08,856
The truth is,
he can sing like a bird.

920
00:37:08,968 --> 00:37:13,137
But if you heard that, he wouldn't have
to reaudition in every city on the tour.

921
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:15,729
Every city that
you almost died in, Nigel.

922
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:18,248
And after Emilina
was released,

923
00:37:18,622 --> 00:37:20,437
he tried to silence her for good

924
00:37:20,596 --> 00:37:22,252
before she could put it all together.

925
00:37:26,293 --> 00:37:27,736
Put what together?

926
00:37:27,856 --> 00:37:29,675
And who might this be,
Detectives?

927
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,434
Meet Bevin Rennie Llywellen.

928
00:37:32,548 --> 00:37:33,917
Ms. Saffron woke up
out of her coma,

929
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:35,558
rabbit-punched me
in the sternum,

930
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:37,824
and remembered this guy
as one of her assailants.

931
00:37:37,934 --> 00:37:40,528
This crystal puts him
at the scene of the crime.

932
00:37:40,697 --> 00:37:44,131
So he made an attempt
on Emilina's life.

933
00:37:44,258 --> 00:37:46,904
Allegedly poisoned
a tuna salad sandwich.

934
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:49,041
Uh, tuna Nicoise salad
sandwich, Chief.

935
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:51,164
There's a difference.

936
00:37:51,263 --> 00:37:53,370
But what about all the other
near misses with Nigel?

937
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,768
But it can't be him.

938
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:55,914
It's impossible.

939
00:37:56,155 --> 00:37:57,593
He was just a contestant.

940
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,659
Sounds like he had somebody

941
00:38:00,432 --> 00:38:02,066
on the inside.

942
00:38:05,844 --> 00:38:07,647
He had somebody
on the inside.

943
00:38:08,446 --> 00:38:09,446
Didn't he?

944
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:11,686
Zzzapato!

945
00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:15,246
Don't be ridiculous.

946
00:38:15,657 --> 00:38:17,971
Zapato adores me.

947
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:19,867
Plus he can't even think.

948
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:21,919
Oh, it has to be someone else.

949
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:23,667
Um, how about Lester?

950
00:38:24,091 --> 00:38:25,959
Oh, I'd love to see him
in prison.

951
00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:29,721
Bevin is Zapato's biggest fan.

952
00:38:32,273 --> 00:38:33,646
They actually became
pretty good friends.

953
00:38:33,731 --> 00:38:35,425
And I don't think this show
turned out to be quite

954
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:38,089
the comeback either of them
were hoping for.

955
00:38:41,243 --> 00:38:42,243
I could go on.

956
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:44,776
But why don't you
take the floor?

957
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:46,984
Zzzapato.

958
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:48,979
Well, what could he say?

959
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:51,411
He can't even speak.

960
00:38:51,552 --> 00:38:53,038
Yes, I can!

961
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:54,793
But you don't let me.

962
00:38:55,062 --> 00:38:57,170
I was the first to sign on.

963
00:38:57,408 --> 00:38:59,092
This was supposed to be
my show!

964
00:38:59,252 --> 00:39:01,474
My shot, my comeback!

965
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:03,024
You turned me into a simp.

966
00:39:03,165 --> 00:39:04,708
I freakin' hate you!

967
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:06,208
People don't even know
who I am.

968
00:39:06,505 --> 00:39:09,180
I get fan letters addressed
to Geraldo,

969
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:13,439
Ricky Martin, and that guy
from El Pollo Loco commercial!

970
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:15,812
You ruined everything!

971
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:18,416
Why won't you die?

972
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:23,639
Really?

973
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,875
That was your plan?

974
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:29,991
That has to be
the poorest-executed attack

975
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:30,992
in history.

976
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:34,193
I was two feet away from you
all the time.

977
00:39:34,307 --> 00:39:38,802
I mean, you have to be
absolutely, without doubt,

978
00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:42,778
the worst murder
I have ever seen.

979
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:44,698

All right, give it up

993
00:41:02,454 --> 00:41:05,041
and Gus TT Showbizz!

994
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:08,488
Great job, gentlemen.

995
00:41:08,578 --> 00:41:10,217
Now let's see
what our judge thought.

996
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:11,698
Come on over.

997
00:41:17,506 --> 00:41:18,589
Sit.

998
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,660
What, are you kidding me?

999
00:41:25,796 --> 00:41:28,533
You look like a couple
of rodeo clowns up there.

1000
00:41:28,645 --> 00:41:29,984
Nothing was in synch.

1001
00:41:30,097 --> 00:41:32,232
Your hairstyles
are ridiculous.

1002
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:36,156
You butchered a terrific song,
and it's time you went home.

1003
00:41:37,352 --> 00:41:39,066
Please, spare us

1004
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,171
additional torture
and just...

1005
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:44,621
euthanize yourselves.
