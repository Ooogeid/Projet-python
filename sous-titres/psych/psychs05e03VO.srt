1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,791
That's the highway
department's problem, Jerry, not mine.

2
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:08,645
I'm gonna have to call you back.

3
00:00:09,464 --> 00:00:12,338
What are you three doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

4
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:15,139
We came to see that UFO you cleared
from that field this morning.

5
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,475
- You mean the weather balloon.
- They got to him.

6
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:20,464
- Who got to me, Dennis?
- The secret government agency

7
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:23,139
in charge of extraterrestrial
cover-ups.

8
00:00:23,717 --> 00:00:26,157
- How much are they paying you?
- That's enough, guys.

9
00:00:26,282 --> 00:00:27,652
Back to school now.

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,030
Do you think this is a game?
I assure you, it's not.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,616
Inside that grounded
Cassiopeian death pod

12
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,035
sits an army of glornokian
mercenaries

13
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:39,872
intent on colonizing our planet
and propagating their evil species.

14
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:41,721
After they probe us.

15
00:00:45,664 --> 00:00:47,363
We should go. He's packing.

16
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:50,383
There are no such things
as UFOs, Shawn.

17
00:00:57,943 --> 00:01:00,349
So the plaintiff is entitled
to compensatory

18
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:03,104
and punitive damages,
per article 35-a,

19
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,823
section "j", which stip...

20
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,357
Are you okay?

21
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,694
Just came by to drop off
the Patterson file

22
00:01:53,437 --> 00:01:54,488
and some refills.

23
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,369
Did you notice
any commotion a moment ago?

24
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:03,914
What kind of commotion
are we talking about?

25
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:13,025
Toby, where are you going?

26
00:03:57,952 --> 00:03:59,780
Aren't you forgetting something?

27
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:05,910
We were supposed to let him
drive around with us.

28
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:07,371
We are not currently driving.

29
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,583
You need to stop taking your frustration
with Shawn out on Henry.

30
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:13,142
Better him than the neighbor's cat.

31
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:22,394
- I could have suffocated in there!
- Jeez, I cracked the window.

32
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,555
I'm glad that Shawn
peanut-buttered your phone.

33
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:26,083
I knew that was him.

34
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:29,643
I still have jif in my ear.

35
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,584
Mr. Kessler, I am detective O'Hara,

36
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:34,019
and this is detective Lassiter,
and this is Henry Spencer,

37
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:36,988
who helps us coordinate
our investigations.

38
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,237
So, sir, I understand
you witnessed a kidnapping last night.

39
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:42,196
I'd say it was more of an abduction.

40
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:44,963
Do you have any idea
who the perpetrator was?

41
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:46,588
An extraterrestrial.

42
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:48,871
How come the crazies
never live close by?

43
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,624
It sounds nuts, but I'm telling you,
I saw it with my own eyes.

44
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:54,831
An alien came down
and snatched a young lawyer

45
00:04:54,956 --> 00:04:56,545
that works at my firm... Toby Shore.

46
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:59,757
No offense, but I think you're gonna
have a hard time finding anyone

47
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,278
to believe a story like that.

48
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:04,470
Was he tall and scaly,
or short, with a huge lollipop head?

49
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:05,763
Tall, I think.

50
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:07,467
- Reptilian.
- Probably hostile.

51
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:11,018
We're gonna need a speak & spell
and seven pounds of mashed potatoes.

52
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,186
Enough!

53
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:14,980
Mr. Kessler, if your co-worker
doesn't show up In the next eight hours,

54
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,307
feel free to file
a missing persons report.

55
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:19,548
Until then, stop wasting our time.

56
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,278
You owe me a new phone!

57
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:27,838
You have a very nice home.

58
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:32,157
This UFO, was it more like
a bright sphere,

59
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:33,916
or two soup bowls glued together?

60
00:05:34,863 --> 00:05:36,692
No, it was a sphere, definitely.

61
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,587
Are you UFO chasers?

62
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,216
Nothing as ridiculous as that.
We're psychic detectives.

63
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,510
And we can help you get to the bottom
of what happened.

64
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:46,512
Fantastic. You're hired.

65
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:50,255
May I have a word?

66
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,728
You shouldn't take this case.

67
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:58,273
You shouldn't be dropping the dime
on my peanut butter pranks.

68
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,589
We all know there's 0% chance
you don't end up believing this kook.

69
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:03,736
- How do you figure that?
- You want to believe him.

70
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:06,115
Just like you wanted to believe
it wasn't a weather balloon,

71
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:09,670
and you wanted to believe that it was
aliens that abducted Joe Piscopo.

72
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,028
That remains my theory until someone can
pinpoint the man's whereabouts.

73
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,582
We will not let our interest in UFOs
affect our judgment.

74
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:20,798
Good. 'cause you run around town
telling everybody an alien did this,

75
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,050
you're gonna look like
a couple of nut jobs.

76
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:27,114
- I can't hire nut jobs.
- Dad, would you relax, please?

77
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:29,588
Obviously we don't think
aliens are responsible.

78
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:31,299
Good.

79
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:32,774
Hold your horses!

80
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:41,239
Because if aliens did do this,

81
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:43,401
there'd be signs
of electrical disruptions.

82
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:44,937
Exactly!

83
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,533
What else would we see?

84
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,732
There would most definitely be
a visible ground disturbance.

85
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:56,603
Right.

86
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,251
So where do you guys want to start?

87
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:02,531
How'bout your terrace?

88
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,994
503
"Not Even Close... Encounters"

89
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,673
Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

90
00:07:37,427 --> 00:07:39,441
All those people
who gave you, Dennis, and I flak

91
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:41,251
for believing in aliens in school...

92
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,772
Jeff Garrett, and that female Russian
exchange student who stole my wallet...

93
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,924
They're gonna eat their words
when this goes public.

94
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,195
I've got news, Gus.

95
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,198
Toby Shore was not abducted
by an alien.

96
00:07:50,323 --> 00:07:52,882
What? But what about
the lights and grass and stuff?

97
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,445
It's time we learned
it's never the crazy suspect.

98
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,226
It wasn't a mummy.
It wasn't the devil.

99
00:07:57,395 --> 00:08:00,069
- It wasn't even Bigfoot.
- Bigfoot? When did we suspect Bigfoot?

100
00:08:00,194 --> 00:08:03,162
Missing school bus case.
There were bite marks in cushion.

101
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:05,012
The driver's seat
was pushed back 6 feet.

102
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:07,757
You're probably
right that it's not an alien,

103
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:10,114
but why don't we keep
investigating just to be sure.

104
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,826
Because my dad actually makes
a valid point.

105
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,635
It's gonna be hard to beobjective
when we're hoping that it's an alien.

106
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,887
- We can rub it in Jeff Darrett's face.
- No, we have to let that go.

107
00:08:20,012 --> 00:08:22,313
So what are you saying,
that we pass on the case?

108
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:24,454
You're $1,200 balance
on your J.C. penney card

109
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:26,474
is not gonna pay for itself.

110
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,766
We'll just have to acknowledge
our mutual tendency

111
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:30,640
to think unreasonably
about this topic,

112
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:32,202
police ourselves accordingly.

113
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:33,927
- How?
- All right...

114
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,099
If one of us starts leaning
towards this theory,

115
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:40,435
- other one flicks him in the ear.
- That's an incredibly stupid idea.

116
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:43,230
You have exactly 3 seconds to beat it.
Three, two, one...

117
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,561
Now, how is that fair?

118
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:52,698
Let's find out what, if anything,
happened here last night.

119
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,745
May I call you Phil?

120
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:01,021
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Fair enough.

121
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:03,834
- How many beers did you drink?
- Just one.

122
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:08,462
Are you implying that I beer-goggled
an alien abduction?

123
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:11,258
- Happened to Gus last new years.
- I hit the white zin hard.

124
00:09:11,773 --> 00:09:14,093
I promise you,
I was sober as a judge.

125
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:15,962
Let me ask you this.

126
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:18,765
If Toby wasn't abducted last night,
what happened to him?

127
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,092
- He left when you weren't looking.
- His car's still in the driveway.

128
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,278
Listen. When I went out to move it
this morning, it wouldn't start.

129
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:27,501
- The car's brand-new!
- Really?

130
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,110
You know, cars often lose
battery power

131
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,070
when they come in contact
with UFOs...

132
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:38,279
- Have you tried calling him?
- About 50 times.

133
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:41,120
- Just goes straight to voice mail.
- Maybe he's out of range.

134
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,416
- What was that for?
- You were implying he's in space.

135
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,626
No, I wasn't.

136
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,170
Yes, you were.

137
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:50,196
Where are you going?

138
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:54,259
Maybe we should talk to your neighbors
to see if they saw anything.

139
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:57,597
Good luck with that. The nearest one's
about half a mile away.

140
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,599
You gotta believe me.

141
00:10:00,973 --> 00:10:04,285
I was just sitting at the desk,
and the whole house started to shake.

142
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,385
And then there were these lights,
and then this...

143
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,560
I was hearing this weird sound.
It sounded like...

144
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:17,866
No, it sounded nothing like that.

145
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,440
Really. Sorry.

146
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,995
I was actually trying
to make this sound.

147
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:27,542
That's it! That's it!
That's the sound.

148
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:30,629
- You weren't even close.
- I struggle with tone deafness.

149
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,297
Now do you believe me?

150
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:37,177
Before we answer that question,
we'll need to consult an expert.

151
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:50,667
Hi, we're looking
for Dennis Gogolack.

152
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:58,282
Get the hell out of here.
I don't believe it!

153
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:01,486
What an awesome surprise!
What are you guys doing?

154
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:02,993
It's been forever!

155
00:11:03,118 --> 00:11:05,449
We didn't even recognize you,
now that you're...

156
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,582
What, not fat and nerdy?

157
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,960
It's okay. It's the truth.
I credit my personal trainer and lasiks.

158
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,256
- Losing the wizard's cloak also helped.
- Get inside here!

159
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:20,429
That's interesting.

160
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,513
Yeah, my wife's into stuff
that dangles.

161
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:25,309
Looks like the software business
has been good to you, Dennis.

162
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:30,545
Very good.

163
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,775
I'm Dennis' wife, Molly.

164
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:36,744
That was the creepiest "very"
that I've ever heard.

165
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:42,173
Babe, this is Shawn and gus.

166
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,954
Two good friends in grade school.
And now they're psychic detectives.

167
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,790
- How cool is that?
- Really cool. Nice meeting you guys.

168
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:51,864
Why didn't you tell me
that we were having friends over?

169
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:55,005
Actually, we didn't give Denny
much of a heads up.

170
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:56,738
Here's the thing...

171
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:59,968
We're investigating a case that may
have involved an alien abduction!

172
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:02,179
And being that your husband is

173
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,281
one of the foremost experts
on the topic...

174
00:12:08,868 --> 00:12:11,813
I'm sorry, guys, I'm afraid
I'm not much of an expert anymore.

175
00:12:12,742 --> 00:12:15,400
It's been 20 years
since I was into that stuff.

176
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:19,154
- Same here, bro, I mean...
- Beer.

177
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,367
Yeah, Denny is a total jock.

178
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:24,117
Guilty.
I'm guilty as charged.

179
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,441
- They did, like, a little...
- Explosion.

180
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:29,081
But you don't have to take off yet.
We've got some catching up to do.

181
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,792
Actually, we're under
a bit of a time crunch.

182
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,784
Let me just give you
a tour of the place.

183
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:36,338
I was actually gonna go hang
with the girls, though. Is that okay?

184
00:12:38,312 --> 00:12:40,269
- Nice meeting you guys.
- Very nice.

185
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:41,515
Stop it.

186
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:43,720
Come check out my office!

187
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:45,046
All right.

188
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:52,169
I gotta say, Dennis, I'm surprised
that you, of all people,

189
00:12:52,294 --> 00:12:53,757
outgrew the whole nerd thing.

190
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:56,400
Come on, you were
a class-three dungeon master

191
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,069
with your own set of custom
12-sided dice.

192
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:12,381
Let's go.

193
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:19,548
Oh, my... You are a closet nerd!

194
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,883
Literally.

195
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,575
You have a replica
of captain Adama's helmet

196
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,934
from the original
<i>Battlestar Galactica</i>?

197
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,395
And Levar Burton's glasses
from <i>Star Trek</i>?

198
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:38,149
Those aren't replicas. I got those
for 15 grand a pop at auction.

199
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,359
I have never been so motivated
to make money.

200
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,515
Wait till I show you
where the magic happens.

201
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,320
And I mean that literally.
There's another hidden room downstairs

202
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:48,243
- where I practice my magic tricks.
- Why all the secrecy?

203
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:52,789
When I first met Molly, it was clear
she was only into guys' guys.

204
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,881
That's what I pretended to be.
She ended up buying it.

205
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:59,873
I guess I've been pretending
ever since.

206
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,841
- Sounds exhausting.
- You have no idea.

207
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:05,205
Every day is a new challenge.

208
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,511
Whether it's trying
to draw blanks during <i>Jeopardy</i>,

209
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,938
or having to sneak in here
every time I want to track

210
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:13,234
some UFO activity
or sew a new renaissance faire costume.

211
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:15,312
Excellent stitch work, my liege.

212
00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:19,774
The worst is when I'm around
Molly's friends' husbands.

213
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:22,334
To say inane stuff, like "beer me",

214
00:14:22,617 --> 00:14:24,446
or, "yeah, I'd totally hit that."

215
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,532
- What, exactly, am I hitting?
- Most likely an attractive lady.

216
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:29,117
That's horrible.

217
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,578
- Is it really worth it, Den?
- Have you seen my wife?

218
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:34,901
We need your opinion
on this recording.

219
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:38,045
Gus is convinced it's a UFO.

220
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:39,586
Let's hear it.

221
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,420
Based on my research,
i'd say that's a voyager pod

222
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:50,805
from the Serpens dwarf galaxy...

223
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,601
- or bad new age music.
- But if you had to choose?

224
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,670
Wait a second.

225
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:00,915
If you guys could give me the time

226
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,777
and location,
I could check the sky activity.

227
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:06,821
I hacked into the national weather
service's computer a few years back,

228
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,282
and can access
their radar database whenever I want.

229
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:11,157
All right.

230
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:12,953
He lives at 25 Buckskin drive.

231
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:15,546
And it happened
around 11:00 at night.

232
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:23,336
- Nothing.
- What do you know.

233
00:15:29,786 --> 00:15:30,958
Wait a minute.

234
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:33,753
You better try 10:44,

235
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,225
just to be safe.

236
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:46,319
You've gotta be kidding me.
What is... What is that?

237
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,284
You all right there, buddy?

238
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:57,706
She doesn't even know
that you're asthmatic?

239
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:00,871
And she never will.

240
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,062
All right, gus, I can't believe
i'm about to say this.

241
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,924
- I think Toby got abducted.
- So do I.

242
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:15,485
You do?
Sweet.

243
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,114
- Why are we both covering our ears?
- I don't know.

244
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:27,819
- Don't call Jeff Garrett.
- Roy needs to know that we believe him.

245
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,196
Right, but make sure you
tell him to keep it on the QT.

246
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,364
I know.

247
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,384
<i>I'm standing here
just outside the home</i>

248
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:36,411
<i>of prominent local attorney
Roy Kessler, who's joined me now,</i>

249
00:16:36,654 --> 00:16:38,705
<i>and has a rather shocking
announcement to make.</i>

250
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:44,711
<i>Last night I witnessed
aliens abduct a fellow co-worker.</i>

251
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:47,047
- People are gonna think he's nuts.
- <i>I can prove it,</i>

252
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:50,121
<i>thanks to the fine investigative work
being done by psychic detectives</i>

253
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:51,217
<i>Shawn Spencer</i>

254
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,995
<i>and Gurton Buster.</i>

255
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,698
Gurton what?

256
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,574
I look like K.D. Lang.

257
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,776
<i>What kind of proof
are we talking about?</i>

258
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,856
Yes, Dad, we'll be right there.

259
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:14,824
Before you go off on us,
answer me this question.

260
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:16,905
Does that picture of me on the news

261
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,162
makes me look like I should be
singing <i>Constant craving</i>?

262
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:21,066
What'd I tell you
about taking this case?

263
00:17:21,191 --> 00:17:23,002
We have hard evidence on this one.

264
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:25,896
Not to mention the fact that Roy Kessler
is a respected attorney

265
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:28,296
- not some crazy conspiracy theorist.
- Are you kidding?

266
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,881
That's exactly what he is!

267
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:32,717
Shawn, have you ever heard
of Budding textiles?

268
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,341
The company that had to fork out
millions for the chemical spill.

269
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:39,068
It got hundreds of people sick.
And who thinks it was done on purpose?

270
00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:40,958
- Erin Brockovich.
- Roy Kessler.

271
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,598
He's preparing a lawsuit
against them.

272
00:17:44,654 --> 00:17:47,007
- We didn't know that.
- I suppose you also didn't know

273
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,442
he's being heavily medicated
for anxiety.

274
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,677
He misses a dose, and he's prone
to psychotic episodes.

275
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:53,780
Last year,

276
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:57,117
he claims to have seen a panda
in his company's kitchen.

277
00:17:57,761 --> 00:17:59,886
That's not crazy at all.
Pandas are big eaters.

278
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,748
Ten years ago, Kessler claimed...
You got it... He saw a UFO

279
00:18:04,513 --> 00:18:06,637
- while on vacation.
- Saucer or sphere?

280
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:10,463
You wouldn't have missed this stuff
if you hadn't been blinded,

281
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:13,802
First of all, the only thing
we were blinded by is...

282
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,704
- Science!
- That never gets old.

283
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,891
Tell me this...
If toby wasn't abducted,

284
00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:19,264
where the hell is he?

285
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:20,724
Right in there.

286
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:25,437
- This morning.
- He really kind of...

287
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,540
He took a cab
to his parents' house that night

288
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:29,016
after his car wouldn't start.

289
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,860
Turned off his phone,
and he slept in.

290
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:36,255
Nice going, man.

291
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,063
I remember him muttering all this stuff
about lights and ships.

292
00:18:52,188 --> 00:18:54,394
I thought it was just Roy being Roy.

293
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,844
And then I turned on the TV today
and heard his insane theory.

294
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,888
- I wouldn't call it insane.
- Let it go.

295
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:02,345
I tried everything I could
to get him to take his meds.

296
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,851
I would even pick them up
at the pharmacy for him

297
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,686
and bring them to him directly.

298
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,467
Man, he's gonna hear it
at the office on monday.

299
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:12,192
Actually, your firm just suspended him
until he completes a month's stay

300
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,249
in a mental health facility.

301
00:19:15,505 --> 00:19:17,071
Who's gonna get all his cases?

302
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,200
We're available.
Isn't that right, Mr. Spencer?

303
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,922
Gus here is a whiz at legal zoom,

304
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,132
and my cousin has a personal injury
law firm called <i>Accidentes</i>.

305
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:27,749
- Heard of it?
- No, I haven't.

306
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:28,750
You will.

307
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:30,908
Good work, people.

308
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:32,045
Papa bear.

309
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:46,964
You know what, I really don't appreciate
being snickered at.

310
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:48,824
Never again are we
investigating something

311
00:19:48,949 --> 00:19:50,860
related to one
of our childhood obsessions.

312
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:53,526
- What if there's a pop rocks murder?
- That is the exception.

313
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,101
Excuse me, Spencer.

314
00:19:55,954 --> 00:19:57,204
Quick question.

315
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,592
How does it feel to be so wrong
that you are now...

316
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:01,825
a walking joke?

317
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:04,536
Just like you, minus the
kind boots and the soft eyes.

318
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:08,705
This is really a big moment for me.

319
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,627
I may even do a little dance.

320
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:13,539
Oh, yes, I will.

321
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:18,647
All right, that's it, Gus.

322
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:21,897
We are gonna find out what happened,
and we are gonna clear our good names.

323
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:23,322
Let me ask you something.

324
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,286
If you were an up and comer,
and you were abducted by aliens...

325
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:28,521
- Because that happens.
- Would you tell anyone?

326
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:30,895
I know I wouldn't,
because they would think I was nuts.

327
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,648
Like I do right now.
That dude was not abducted.

328
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:37,269
You have 3s to come up with a better
theory to explain all this weirdness.

329
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,196
- Three, two, one...
- That's my trick.

330
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:43,366
Explain the radar, the recording,
the indentation on the lawn.

331
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,243
It was a plane on the radar.

332
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,246
Someone cranking yanni on the recorder.
The indentation could be lots of things.

333
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:51,249
How do you explain the three strange
markings on Toby's arm?

334
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:55,436
- You saw those?
- Of course. I didn't have to do this.

335
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:58,615
Are you mocking my "it's a clue" face?
Do it again.

336
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,966
I don't look like that.
You're a bastard.

337
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:03,928
You know that abductees often have
strange markings on their skin.

338
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,015
So do I when I don't use
enough sunscreen... Now come here.

339
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,521
- Stand still, let me flick your ear.
- He was abducted.

340
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,148
- Was not.
- Yes, he was.

341
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,520
- Yes, he was.
- Wasn't infinity!

342
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:22,184
If you're gonna act like a child,
we must bring in a 3d party to settle.

343
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,282
Fine. Who?

344
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,077
He was abducted. The markings and
the other details have me convinced.

345
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,163
Why would I tag in a guy
with a custom-made ewok costume?

346
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:32,332
What's the name
of that law firm he works at?

347
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,003
- Wilcox, Kessler, and something.
- Hold on. What are you doing?

348
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,630
Getting his work address
so you can spy on this guy.

349
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:44,011
You have to see if he's exhibiting
the other telltale abduction signs.

350
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,554
You know this.
Paranoia!

351
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,016
- Compulsion to travel to unknown areas.
- Suicidal tendencies.

352
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,894
Spewing nonsense with authority.
Wait, that's you guys.

353
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:55,647
You mock, but I'm still waiting
on a better theory from you.

354
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:04,865
All right.
It was Toby.

355
00:22:06,928 --> 00:22:08,677
Why did he tilt his head and squint?

356
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:11,371
- It's his "I got a clue" face.
- Think at it, Gust.

357
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,833
Toby knew hewill inherit all of Roy's
cases if he got him out of the way.

358
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,738
So he arranged for him to have one
of his psychotic episodes.

359
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:18,712
How?

360
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:23,967
<i>I would even pick the meds up from the
pharmacy and bring them to him directly.</i>

361
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,928
By tampering with his meds.

362
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,722
And you know what,
it worked like a charm.

363
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,641
Roy goes nuts. The next day,

364
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,741
Toby's a major player at the firm.

365
00:22:32,908 --> 00:22:34,311
- Let's go.
- Where?

366
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,814
Well, we're gonna take Dennis' advice,
do a little spying on our boy.

367
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,783
What can I do?

368
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,110
You could lend us
some sweet disguises.

369
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,987
Fellas, tell me what you need.

370
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,203
- I have never felt cooler.
- You've never looked cooler.

371
00:22:51,816 --> 00:22:55,566
Dennis is gonna have to pry this helmet
of my cold, dead noggin.

372
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:56,924
There's Toby.

373
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,732
Dude, he's sweating and shaking.

374
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:08,944
Do you saw clues this time?

375
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:11,650
Paranoia is one of the
telltale signs of an abduction.

376
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:13,715
It's the sign of a guy
feeling guilty.

377
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:17,532
Stop saying stupid things.
You're a disgrace to those glasses.

378
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,231
He's bolting, Gus!

379
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,715
He's wandering to unknown areas.

380
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:28,605
This helmet is not made for running!

381
00:23:28,772 --> 00:23:32,672
I should have borrowed Charlton Heston's
scarf from soylent green.

382
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:40,669
I can't see
out these glasses, Shawn.

383
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,919
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

384
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,090
We lost him.
Son of a...

385
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:51,221
<i>Hello?
Is this Shawn Spencer?</i>

386
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:53,549
Toby?

387
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:55,350
<i>Help me. They're following me.</i>

388
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,274
Whoa, whoa.
Calm down, man.

389
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:59,240
- Who's following you?
- I don't know.

390
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:03,250
<i>it's the black dude from star trek and
some white guy in a ridiculous helmet.</i>

391
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:05,360
Which is your opinion.
Where are you?

392
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:09,364
<i>Listen to me.
Roy Kessler was telling the truth.</i>

393
00:24:09,874 --> 00:24:10,924
I told you!

394
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,618
- OK. You need to come meet us.
- <i>I can't. It's too dangerous.</i>

395
00:24:15,785 --> 00:24:18,250
<i>Meet me in an hour in front
of the Lansdowne hotel.</i>

396
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,791
Lansdowne. Got it.

397
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:22,169
Dude, did you just break
Dennis' helmet?

398
00:24:23,554 --> 00:24:25,647
Well, it clearly wasn't made
for running, Gus.

399
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:26,814
You...

400
00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:32,930
Was that scarf worth
going back to Dennis'?

401
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,797
Is soylent green people?

402
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:38,901
- Let's go get this confession.
- The admission that he was abducted.

403
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:41,040
Let's start
with the non-batcrap angle.

404
00:24:41,207 --> 00:24:43,319
You heard him say
Kessler was telling the truth.

405
00:24:43,486 --> 00:24:46,034
Gus, you're really putting me
in a tough spot here.

406
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:49,454
You don't think I want to be the guy
riffing on how aliens abducted Toby,

407
00:24:50,258 --> 00:24:52,458
and what they did to him
on board the mother ship?

408
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,931
They placed an embryo in his stomach
that will hatch out his ear in 12 days.

409
00:24:56,098 --> 00:24:59,498
I can't do it! Someone has to hold
the sanity bag in this partnership, and

410
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,527
I miss the days
when it used to be you.

411
00:25:01,694 --> 00:25:04,257
Shawn, he's exhibiting
all the telltale signs.

412
00:25:04,424 --> 00:25:06,774
Paranoia, check!
Nervousness, check!

413
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,492
Suicidal tendencies.
Check.

414
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:23,105
Hey, Jules.
What's the word?

415
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,262
Well, we just found out
that Toby wired

416
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:28,026
all of the money from his bank account,
about 500 grand,

417
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,903
to a charity
an hour before his death.

418
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,074
We haven't found a note yet,
but it's looking like suicide.

419
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,033
I don't know about that.

420
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,778
Don't you find strange that a junior
lawyer has that kind of account balance?

421
00:25:39,945 --> 00:25:42,457
Not to mention the fact he was
Roy Kessler's former co-worker.

422
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,857
Ooh, no, my senses are telling me

423
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:46,551
there is more to this.

424
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:48,130
- Much more.
- Settle.

425
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,258
Let me guess. You think
the Loch Ness monster did it.

426
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,260
What are you two doing here?

427
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,471
- Came to get going on the Shore case.
- Why? You're not being hired on it.

428
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,558
- You can't be serious.
- Shawn, I warned you.

429
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,561
I can't stick my neck out for 2 guys
viewed as the village idiots.

430
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,230
Village idiots?
Who here thinks that?

431
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,916
Dirty Larry!

432
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:14,934
Sorry.

433
00:26:15,444 --> 00:26:18,042
Look, Gus and I might be
a lot of things. Handsome, chiseled.

434
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,446
- Smart.
- Urbane.

435
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,038
Whatever that means.
But not idiots!

436
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,918
I'm sorry, guys.

437
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:28,518
My bad.

438
00:26:30,004 --> 00:26:32,507
That's all me. But
Who needs a fan this big?

439
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:34,676
- Leave now!
- Fine.

440
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,176
- Fine. We're audi.
- All right...

441
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:39,112
Smooth move!

442
00:26:39,435 --> 00:26:41,243
Come on, give a brother some credit.

443
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,260
Let's see what we got here.

444
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:44,971
Nada.

445
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:47,772
Recipe for Juliet's weird cleanse.

446
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:51,160
- Preliminary coroner's report.
- What does it say?

447
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:54,427
Apparently they found
a strange object in Toby's...

448
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:55,796
Stomach.

449
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,782
- Embryo.
- Come on.

450
00:27:01,673 --> 00:27:02,673
Woodrow!

451
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,414
Hey, boys.

452
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:07,781
You have got to try these French fries.
They're killer.

453
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:10,378
- We ate, thanks.
- For the last time.

454
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:14,663
We need to talk to you about the autopsy
you did on Toby Shore.

455
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:17,886
- What about it?
- We know you're hiding something.

456
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:19,446
Fine.

457
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:22,933
- I stole his watch.
- You did what?

458
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,227
Nothing.
Hey, how'bout some fried clams?

459
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,188
We want to know what
you found in his stomach.

460
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,315
Telling you that
will get me in trouble.

461
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,235
More or less than you'd get in
for looting corpses?

462
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,611
A flash drive.

463
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,495
Now, when you say flash drive,
is that coroner code for an alien embryo

464
00:27:37,662 --> 00:27:39,950
- that hatches in the ear?
- No, that's "starfish".

465
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,911
This was a legitimate 4 gigabyte
flash drive. There were...

466
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:46,289
I take notes...

467
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,936
abrasions on his lungs,
which implied

468
00:27:49,103 --> 00:27:51,127
he swallowed it
moments before his death.

469
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,380
Interesting.
And the markings on his left arm?

470
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,230
That was a birth mark.

471
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,175
Where is this flash drive now?

472
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,885
It's with Detective Lassiter.

473
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,054
Great. Thanks, Woody.
You stay creepy.

474
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:02,931
You know I will.

475
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,511
You know, Spencer,
the minute you refused to hire

476
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:16,236
that smarmy, fortune-telling kid
of yours,

477
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,270
you officially made it off
my crap list.

478
00:28:19,987 --> 00:28:21,057
Here. See?

479
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:26,053
You actually have a crap list?

480
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:29,192
I like to keep track of people
who've wronged me over the years.

481
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,459
You know, people like
your son, my mother...

482
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,837
Olympia freakin' Dukakis!

483
00:28:34,628 --> 00:28:35,839
You disturb me.

484
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,148
Do I?

485
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:40,719
Welcome back, Henry.

486
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:46,164
But I've gotta say it is really nice to
be able to do some real police work

487
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:49,081
without worrying about
your son interfering.

488
00:28:52,953 --> 00:28:54,149
What the hell?

489
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:01,406
Can I get somebody
from I.T. Over here?

490
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,284
Dobson, come help me out!

491
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,080
I'm not comfortable
hacking a police computer.

492
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,334
It's his personal one. Which reminds me
to check the Internet search history.

493
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:15,511
All right.

494
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:17,785
Let's see.

495
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:20,262
"Grenadefancy.com,

496
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:22,129
squirrelassassins. Com."

497
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:23,367
And...

498
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:26,076
That's gross.

499
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:27,474
That man needs Jesus.

500
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,775
Let's see what's on
that flash drive, shall we?

501
00:29:34,746 --> 00:29:37,984
Sorry, Gus, doesn't look like
a blueprint for an alien fertility lab.

502
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,234
Shocker!

503
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,447
It'sa bunch of legal documents
related to Budding textiles.

504
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,324
Kessler was working on that case.

505
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,202
He believed the chemical spill
was done on purpose.

506
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,661
That is crazy.

507
00:29:58,317 --> 00:30:00,467
- I've got something.
- We know.

508
00:30:01,308 --> 00:30:03,338
Damn, I've really gotta
stop doing that.

509
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:05,085
Denny, where are you?

510
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,889
Quick, get out of here! Go!

511
00:30:08,313 --> 00:30:09,463
Denny? Denny?

512
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,852
One minute, babe.

513
00:30:17,761 --> 00:30:19,067
What's going on in here?

514
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:22,259
- Uh, you know, guy stuff.
- Steak.

515
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,930
You can't host a football party
in your office.

516
00:30:26,097 --> 00:30:27,979
Come on, Taylor just got a safety!

517
00:30:28,146 --> 00:30:30,495
Sweet!
I'll be right there, babe.

518
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,458
Bye, Molly.

519
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,076
- What's a safety?
- Really?

520
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:42,132
Dennis, why don't you blow off
this party and come with us?

521
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,800
Where are we going?

522
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,887
I'm not sure, but it involves
a small town and some potential danger.

523
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,389
Oh, that sounds cool.

524
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,622
- How much danger?
- But I can't, man.

525
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:53,289
Molly would kill me!

526
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:56,561
Dennis, you're never gonna know what
it feels like to be a normal guy

527
00:30:56,728 --> 00:30:59,607
as long as you're pretending
to be something that you're not.

528
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:00,942
Trust me, he knows.

529
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,279
Come on.
It's time for you to get out there

530
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,430
and experience some real-life,
non-virtual adventure.

531
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,869
He's right. It's time to
come out of the nerd closet.

532
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:17,834
I'm sorry, guys, I just can't.

533
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,534
I really like having sex
with my wife.

534
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,592
Don't say it.
What's wrong with you, man?

535
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:38,773
Now tell me
what the hell we're doing here.

536
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,773
Guess who's now
the owner of this home

537
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:44,198
along with the 700 similar ones
that make up this tiny town.

538
00:31:44,365 --> 00:31:46,621
Shawn, if you say "us,"
I'm gonna punch you.

539
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:48,146
Budding textiles.

540
00:31:48,313 --> 00:31:50,077
It's the last one they purchased.

541
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:52,887
Why would Budding want a bunch of
crappy houses on poisoned land?

542
00:31:53,054 --> 00:31:56,207
Here's a better question... what is
the world's coolest truck doing here?

543
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:57,582
It's a decepticon.

544
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,565
It's not a decepticon, Gus.
It was made in Fresno.

545
00:32:00,732 --> 00:32:03,796
Whatever it is, I highly suggest
we do not touch it.

546
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,786
- The keys were here. What should I do?
- Not start it.

547
00:32:14,953 --> 00:32:16,809
- It's not that easy.
- Actually, it is.

548
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:20,745
When Toby said
that Roy Kessler was telling the truth,

549
00:32:20,912 --> 00:32:24,484
he didn't mean an abduction.
He meant the lawsuit against Budding.

550
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,087
That makes no sense.

551
00:32:26,254 --> 00:32:28,279
Why would they intentionally
spill chemicals?

552
00:32:31,622 --> 00:32:33,701
- To get people to leave.
- What?

553
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:36,251
In all the ridiculous science classes
over the years,

554
00:32:36,418 --> 00:32:38,289
did you ever learn about
hydrocarbons?

555
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,501
Of course I did. The organic compounds
found mainly in crude oil.

556
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,629
If there's a high percentage of them,
does that mean that there's oil?

557
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,006
You'd have to check using a machine

558
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,217
that sends vibrations
into the earth.

559
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,891
- We're in one of those machines!
- Why must you always touch stuff?

560
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,488
It stopped shaking.

561
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:19,425
I feel like a bobblehead.

562
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:20,790
- Idiot.
- Try it.

563
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,317
- No.
- Get in on the bit.

564
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:24,210
- I don't want to.
- It's fun!

565
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,130
you look ridiculous.
Think about it. It all makes sense.

566
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,645
Budding figured out that
this was a gold mine.

567
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:33,157
So what does he do? He orchestrates
a chemical spill to drive everyone away.

568
00:33:33,324 --> 00:33:34,869
That way he wouldn't have to share.

569
00:33:35,036 --> 00:33:38,480
Exactly. Which, I imagine, dwarfs the
cost of lawsuits and land purchases.

570
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:41,394
- And Kessler was onto all of this.
- Which sort of freaks me out.

571
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,644
Why?

572
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:47,355
Because it makes me wonder what else
he was telling the truth about.

573
00:34:04,338 --> 00:34:06,438
I don't want to get probed, Gus!

574
00:34:06,872 --> 00:34:10,472
What are you worried about?
You're the one who's less exotic!

575
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:30,693
Get in here!

576
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:52,882
Well, boys...
Start talking.

577
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:56,052
About what, exactly? How'bout a story?
Would you like to hear a story?

578
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,846
- Please. I always enjoy a good one.
- All right.

579
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:01,649
Once upon a time there was
this greedy ceo.

580
00:35:01,816 --> 00:35:04,143
- Think, what, Stephen Lang?
- "Esque."

581
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,522
He wanted to kill this lawyer, because
the lawyer was on the verge of ruining

582
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,259
his plan. But he couldn't,

583
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,235
because the lawyer had
prepared a legitimate case against him.

584
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:14,596
Hot start.
Please continue.

585
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,375
He figured out that if he could
make the lawyer look wacko,

586
00:35:17,542 --> 00:35:21,202
the case would be dismissed as
some nutty conspiracy theory. But how?

587
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,163
<i>And ten years ago,
Kessler claimed to have seen,</i>

588
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,034
<i>you got it, a ufo!</i>

589
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:30,545
Light bulb. He would convince the lawyer
he'd witnessed an abduction.

590
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,378
He already had this fancy copter,

591
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:36,549
so he add extra lighting, pump some
Enya b-sides through the sound system,

592
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:39,011
and figure out
how to trip the electricity.

593
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:42,807
- He most likely used an EMP device.
- What is that, a pregnancy test?

594
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,977
Doesn't make any sense.
Let me tell the story.

595
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,895
EMT, that's electrical pulses.

596
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:51,691
There's a fine line between being
knowledgeable and arrogant.

597
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,866
Enough!
I'm on the edge of my seat here.

598
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:58,638
Right. Well, it all worked like a charm,
with one exception.

599
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:03,119
See, the young lawyer that he paid
500 gs to to set up this guy,

600
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,123
had a change of heart once he came
across the dismissed-case file.

601
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:10,501
But it was still
just a minor mishap for our ceo

602
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,010
because he is a problem solver.

603
00:36:24,862 --> 00:36:26,434
- I like his style.
- Yeah.

604
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,434
And he was in the clear
until he came across

605
00:36:29,745 --> 00:36:33,357
two young go-getters,
and they were onto everything.

606
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:39,932
Who he then proceeded to let go

607
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:42,533
because they promised
not to tell a soul.

608
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,036
They swore.
Because that's stronger than a promise.

609
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,929
That's not gonna happen.

610
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,041
It's not?

611
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,086
And to think I only
picked you up for trespassing.

612
00:36:56,509 --> 00:36:57,934
Take 'em out back.

613
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:01,969
Don't worry, I texted my dad.
The cops will be here any minute.

614
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,977
- Who is it?
- Messenger service.

615
00:37:11,608 --> 00:37:13,439
I have a delivery
for you to sign.

616
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,435
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.

617
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,042
- Let's see some I.D.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

618
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:29,914
Holy...

619
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,839
and he spent the rest
of his miserable life in jail. The end.

620
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,006
My lip!

621
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:44,011
- Dude, how'd you find us?
- I cloned Shawn's cell phone earlier.

622
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,764
I think I did some real damage
to my pre-molars.

623
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:47,807
It's OK.

624
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,652
You looked like a badass until you
clocked yourself in the face.

625
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:53,983
- You needed this, man!
- Hands in the air!

626
00:37:57,488 --> 00:37:59,193
You, hands in the air!

627
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,695
Put those down!

628
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,196
Put 'em down!

629
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,907
No, Lassie, don't do it!
No, wait! Not him!

630
00:38:12,193 --> 00:38:13,693
He didn't need that.

631
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,509
- I see it now.
- Right?

632
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,887
I look like I finished
a set at Lilith fair.

633
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,644
All right, let me have it.

634
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,901
I have better things to do with my time
than gloat about being a hero.

635
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:40,722
And the fact that you caused
one of our friends to whiz himself.

636
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:42,286
I'm here for police advice.

637
00:38:43,493 --> 00:38:45,406
- Really?
- No, it's boogie time.

638
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:51,329
Is there ever
a high road between you guys?

639
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:54,532
Jerks.

640
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,967
Well, well, well,

641
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:59,795
if it isn't "ignore
your son's urgent text" man.

642
00:39:00,045 --> 00:39:02,465
Good thing you told Juliet,
and she took it seriously.

643
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,743
I thought you were still goofing around.
Your credibility hasn't been too high.

644
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,112
That's no excuse.

645
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:10,479
You can make it up to us
by approving these expenses.

646
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:14,602
What? $7,000 in dental work
for Dennis Gogolack?

647
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,521
- And a new pair of underpants.
- 22 packs of razzles?

648
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:21,183
Season tickets to the Los Angeles sparks
of the WNBA?

649
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,777
Are you serious?

650
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,571
- As a Rebecca Lobo set shot.
- Glass!

651
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,872
I'll think about it.
In the meantime,

652
00:39:28,122 --> 00:39:31,236
chief Vick wants you
take a look at this counterfeit thing.

653
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:35,407
Oh, look at that! Now you want us.
Well, guess what. It's gonna cost you.

654
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,458
How much?

655
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,001
- Two grand.
- 1,500.

656
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,712
Sorry, heroes don't work
for less than two large.

657
00:39:43,016 --> 00:39:43,814
Fine.

658
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:46,535
Sweet.
Now can we see you make it official?

659
00:39:46,702 --> 00:39:50,096
Yeah, just put it right in the old, uh,
bibbity-bobbity.

660
00:39:51,066 --> 00:39:53,557
What? Thanks, dad.
We'll start tomorrow.

661
00:39:53,807 --> 00:39:54,725
Why not now?

662
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:57,436
Because we've got to visit
some friends.

663
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:14,870
Oh, my God, Shawn,
you look like Billie Jean king.

664
00:40:17,802 --> 00:40:20,292
- Detonate the pillar of Attu!
- I know how to play!

665
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:22,621
I've gotta say,
I can't thank you enough

666
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:25,673
for clearing my name.
I don't know how I'll ever repay you.

667
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,802
We do have a coroner buddy who's in
some hot water over a stolen watch.

668
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,762
- Consider him represented.
- Thanks.

669
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,139
This experience

670
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,212
has taught me a really important lesson
when it comes to

671
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:38,728
some of the crazy stuff
that I often see.

672
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,521
That there's an explanation?

673
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:44,910
No, it's that the eyes never lie.
Did I tell you guys I once saw bigfoot?

674
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,879
What?

675
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,322
- You think I'm nuts.
- Male or female?

676
00:40:50,572 --> 00:40:52,700
- Was he driving a school bus?
- No...

677
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,304
babe... Hey.

678
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,252
Where am I standing right now?

679
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:06,130
Denny...
What's going on?

680
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:09,333
You know, it's dudes being dudes.

681
00:41:09,591 --> 00:41:10,801
Cigars.

682
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,640
So listen...
There's something I need to tell you.

683
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:28,569
I'm not actually a jock.

684
00:41:31,087 --> 00:41:32,437
I'm a giant nerd.

685
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:37,036
- I don't know what to say.
- Are you angry?

686
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:38,836
No, I'm pissed.

687
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:45,003
Do you know that I've seen
every single episode

688
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,339
of the original Battlestar Galactica,
like, 50 times?

689
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:52,384
I never told you 'cause I thought
you'd look down on that stuff.

690
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:54,095
You've gotta be kidding.

691
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,230
No. What do you think I was watching

692
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:58,599
while you went away
on that business conference?

693
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,061
I wasn't at a business conf...
I was at Comic-Con!

694
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,897
No way.
I wanted to go to that!

695
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,690
I love you.

696
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,075
I love you.

697
00:42:12,216 --> 00:42:14,899
She just got even hotter.
What?
