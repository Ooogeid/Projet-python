1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,180
You look illumineous right now.

2
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:05,060
If you're quiet,
you can hear the horses sleeping.

3
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:06,417
I cannot.

4
00:00:06,822 --> 00:00:08,269
It sounds like nothing to me.

5
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:09,282
Dad?

6
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:11,467
What are you watching?

7
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:15,298
Nothing, Shawn. It's your mom's stupid
so up opera. She left it on.

8
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:19,100
I wasn't watching at all.
I was taking a nap, actually.

9
00:00:19,765 --> 00:00:22,243
Do you sleep with your eyes wide open?

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,482
Okay, Shawn, yes,
maybe I was half watching. Not,

11
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:27,151
because I like it,
but because it's educational.

12
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:29,941
Pay close attention,
you might learn a little something too.

13
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:32,767
I had a vasec to my two years ago.

14
00:00:32,787 --> 00:00:35,641
That logan is probably cheating on skye?

15
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:38,325
No, Shawn,
I'm talking about sharpening your skills.

16
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:39,979
Look, watch her closely.

17
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:41,512
Tell me what you see.

18
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:46,213
She's... looking into the light.

19
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:49,159
Bingo.
Looking directly into the lights

20
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:51,918
makes her eyes tear up, she cries.

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,898
Seen perps do it all the time
in the interrogation room.

22
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:57,545
So acting's really just a lie?

23
00:00:57,752 --> 00:01:01,477
Of course, Shawn. What, you think those
goof balls on chips are really cops?

24
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:04,087
Wow,
anything else you wanna ruin for me?

25
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:11,713
I don't think we're allowed to
be on one of these things, Shawn.

26
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:14,585
If they didn't want us to drive it, why
did they leave the key sunder the seat?

27
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:16,715
This is not how I wanna be
spending my saturday morning.

28
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:20,175
Dude, Lassie called, man.
He called us. Us, the team!

29
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:23,505
Besides, this is a real, live television
studio, Gus. What could be better?

30
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:24,735
Eating my breakfast.

31
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:28,013
I was having a poached egg with
Hollandaise sauce on an English muffin.

32
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:29,465
Look, we'll solve it up quick.

33
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:31,835
You'll be back home in no time. Hello?

34
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,535
Dame Judi Dench called.
She wants her breakfast back.

35
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:37,344
Did you just do the something called
and want sits something back bit?

36
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:39,625
Look around, Gus.
These are my people.

37
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:41,335
- Who are your people?
- These people.

38
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:45,958
Artists, thinkers, dreamers,
guy dressed as toast.

39
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,900
Now, if I were a crime scene,
where would I be?

40
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,229
Here I am.

41
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,995
Hey, I know this place.

42
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,481
- This is Corrine's living room.
- Who the hell is Corrine?

43
00:01:58,563 --> 00:02:01,465
It's the living room from
explosion gigantesca de Romance.

44
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:03,733
- What are you saying?
- It's a Spanish soap opera, Shawn.

45
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:06,535
How do you know that? Who are you?
What happened to my best friend?

46
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:09,285
My gosh! And Lassiter
is talking to Jorge Gama-Lobo.

47
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:11,440
He plays Vicente on the show.
He's my favorite.

48
00:02:11,658 --> 00:02:14,522
He slept with Mariana at his
own mother's funeral, Shawn.

49
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:15,560
What the...

50
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,555
it's on in every doctor's
office I visit.

51
00:02:17,575 --> 00:02:19,765
I had no choice but to get sucked in.

52
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:22,475
You had a choice.
You still have a choice.

53
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:24,136
Who's the dead guy?

54
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:25,290
That's Rinaldo Nunez.

55
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:27,952
He played Ernesto on the show.
He used to be married to Corrine.

56
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:31,904
I'm sorry, dude. I can't believe you
actually watch this show.  It's in Spanish.

57
00:02:31,924 --> 00:02:33,985
Everyone in Santa Barbara is watching it,
Shawn.

58
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:35,705
The tele Novela is a craze.

59
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:42,975
Okay, what ever this case is,
I want in on it.

60
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,575
And I don't care how you do it.

61
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:46,276
Spencer, thank god you're here.

62
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:47,910
Now go home.

63
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:50,941
We don't need you. O'Hara jumped the gun.
This thing's pretty much open and shut.

64
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,016
Jules.

65
00:02:52,116 --> 00:02:54,655
If you want to spend more time with me,
you don't have to trump up some case.

66
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,303
You just pick up the phone, give me a call,
say "Shawn, I'm here, I've got pudding pops."

67
00:02:58,425 --> 00:02:59,648
I'll keep that in mind.

68
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:01,607
Fact is, we have tape of

69
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:05,588
Mr. Gama-Lobo here actually stabbing
the victim on camera.

70
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:10,719
Will someone listen to me, please!

71
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,364
For the last time,
I had no idea the collapsible

72
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:15,388
prop knife had been replaced
with the real one.

73
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,367
I believe him.

74
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:20,485
He's your favorite actor? Really?

75
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:22,308
That felt a little forced to me.

76
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:30,097
Spencer, why are you still here?
I told you to run along.

77
00:03:31,649 --> 00:03:35,111
Hurry up, ask a question that proves
there's more here than meets the eye.

78
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,960
I have a question!

79
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:40,690
Are those delicious looking
sandwiches for everybody?

80
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:43,036
Yes, for everyone working
on the stage here.

81
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:43,980
Thank you.

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,437
That's it? That's your question?

83
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:46,715
Follow up question!

84
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:50,162
- Do you have salami?
- Not by it self, no.

85
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:52,466
But as part of another sandwich with
other Italian meats.

86
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:54,147
That's interesting.

87
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:55,666
I like that very much.

88
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,355
All right, everybody,
let's bag and wrap this up.

89
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,050
Sir, you're gonna need to come
with us for some more questions.

90
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:01,704
Help me, please.

91
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:03,509
Who ever you are.

92
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:09,415
Unbelievable, Shawn. I ask for one case.
One case and you couldn't get us in on it.

93
00:04:09,435 --> 00:04:11,630
Dude, I'm sorry. There's no case here.

94
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:13,215
Lassie's actually right.

95
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:17,680
Your boy stabbed some dude on
camera in front of everybody, look.

96
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:23,204
What?

97
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:25,349
- There's no tells.
- What?

98
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:27,925
<i>Look at the moment
when the knife goes into Nunez.</i>

99
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,785
- <i>It looks like it hurts.</i>
- <i>Yeah, but look there, Gama-Lobo's face.</i>

100
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:35,175
He doesn't look angry, he looks fright.

101
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:37,445
More importantly, he looks surprised.

102
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,063
That is not the face
of a premeditated killer.

103
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:41,593
So what does that mean?

104
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:43,730
- I think it means we have a case.
- Yes!

105
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:48,495
A big fat double-stuffed chalupa
of a case with guacamole.

106
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:49,539
Yes!

107
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:51,745
That's too hard!

108
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,730
Saison 2 - Episode 13
<i>Lights, Camera...Homicidio. </i>

109
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,445
The Dream Team synchronizators :
<i>¤AkaZab¤, Flolo</i>

110
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:08,998
- Transcript : ydy.com [V1.1]

111
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:17,318
I hate you, Ernesto! Die!

112
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,276
Come on, dude!
I'm stabbing you in the heart!

113
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:25,195
Give me something to work with here!

114
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:27,636
Okay, look,
that's a very interesting theory,

115
00:05:27,656 --> 00:05:30,305
Mr. Spencer, but the tape
is pretty damning evidence.

116
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:33,469
Chief, all due respect, he'd have
to be the worst criminal of all time.

117
00:05:33,489 --> 00:05:34,665
Or the smartest.

118
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:37,084
Of course he's gonna claim
he didn't know the knife was switched.

119
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,753
Aren't we getting ahead of ourselves?

120
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:41,207
- Mr. Gama-Lobo isn't under arrest.
- Yet.

121
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:44,290
The producers have just temporarily
suspended him from the show.

122
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,303
- They pulled him off the show?
- Temporarily.

123
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:48,311
Until more progress is
made in the investigation.

124
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:49,495
But you can't do that.

125
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,199
He's right in the middle of an important
love triangle with Corrine.

126
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:55,018
And we haven't even found out
whether Serena's baby is his or not.

127
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,713
What I meant to say was,

128
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:01,312
the man is an actor

129
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:04,733
on a television program.
It is his job, his live lihood.

130
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:07,625
You can't just take away a
man's means to sustain himself.

131
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:09,171
To put food on the table.

132
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:14,211
- I need to know if that baby's his.
- I have just one question.

133
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:17,325
If this is about food, I'm telling you
right now, I will not be a happy man.

134
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:19,405
How do you explain the hair on the knife?

135
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:20,526
The what?

136
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:23,482
I am sensing there was a long hair
in the evidence bag.

137
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:25,247
A woman's hair.

138
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,457
Perhaps belong in to a ted nugent
impersonator.

139
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:28,954
But one thing is certain.

140
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:31,092
It didn't come from the head of
Mr. Gama-Lobo.

141
00:06:31,215 --> 00:06:32,550
Was there a hair in the bag?

142
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,995
Actually, there was.
We haven't run it through the lab yet.

143
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:36,016
Why not?

144
00:06:36,036 --> 00:06:39,255
Because, chief we feel the most damning
piece of evidence that tape.

145
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,910
The hair could have come from anywhere.
The evidence guy who bagged it.

146
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,064
Officer Henze is bald, detective.

147
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:48,117
I am sensing...

148
00:06:48,335 --> 00:06:50,066
that the owner of that Hair is
our killer.

149
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:52,506
Chief, you give us one day... one day!

150
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:57,195
And you have our word, we'll make
sure this blatant departmental screw-up

151
00:06:57,215 --> 00:07:00,411
doesn't bring down the entire
Santa Barbara police world...

152
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,254
universe...

153
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:03,688
galaxy.

154
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:05,371
One day.

155
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:10,519
But the best news is,

156
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:13,845
now that we're officially on the case,
we have craft service privileges.

157
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:17,165
Which means all the gummy bears and
poppycock we can Jam in our bellies.

158
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:19,979
But we only have one day to eat them.
Let's get to work, Shawn.

159
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:21,855
That's lance Rothstein.
Let's start with him.

160
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,407
He's the head writer on the show.

161
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,625
I saw his picture once
in soap Diary magazine.

162
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,500
Head writer? He's not even Spanish.

163
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,265
No, he was a Hollywood guy.

164
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:30,562
Used to write on Blossom.

165
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:33,660
Decided Spanish soap operas were a better
reflection of the human condition.

166
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,493
Obviously he didn't write the Blossom

167
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:38,215
where she adopted a chimp and
hit the road in an 18-wheeler.

168
00:07:38,235 --> 00:07:40,975
- That was Bj and the bear, Shawn.
- You tell them that line is cut.

169
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:43,368
- Don't listen to them, they're actors.
- Floyd Rothstein.

170
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:45,677
Lance Rothstein.
You have a moment? We're big fans.

171
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:47,298
No, I don't have a moment.
I don't mean to be rude.

172
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:50,701
You have a head shot, just drop it off in
the casting department right off the lobby.

173
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,361
No, sir. We're not actors.

174
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:54,971
You're not?
Fur the shing from it. I'm a psychic.

175
00:07:55,095 --> 00:07:57,761
I don't really, not interested in
getting my fortune told.

176
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:59,515
- Mr..?
- Spencer. Shawn Spencer.

177
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:01,271
This is my partner, Lavender Gooms.

178
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:03,695
We're here with the police investigating
the Nunez case.

179
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:05,395
Mr. Rothstein, I'm Burton Guster.

180
00:08:05,415 --> 00:08:06,755
We were here yesterday
at the crime scene,

181
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:10,834
and we know that Jorge Gama-Lobo was not
responsible for the death of Rinaldo Nunez.

182
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:11,908
- He wasn't?
- No.

183
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:15,546
Shocking! I know that.
And I don't work with crystal balls.

184
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,305
Make a note. I just let that go.

185
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:21,362
It would have been way too easy.

186
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,728
Yeah, look, while we're talking here,

187
00:08:24,748 --> 00:08:27,125
a murderer
is wandering around loose on my set.

188
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:29,590
Which is not comforting for
someone with my weak constitution.

189
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,885
I al ready have here Ditary
Angina and shin splints.

190
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:34,645
Listen, are you sure that
you are not an actor?

191
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:36,454
Because you really
do have a certain look.

192
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:37,905
What, a shallow look?

193
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:38,935
No, I have to go.

194
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:40,245
Whoa, I still have some more questions.

195
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:42,945
Look, if I do not shoot this scene...

196
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:45,651
right now, then later in the week,
we're gonna be doing this show live.

197
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,945
Why don't you find me later
on the set, all right?

198
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:50,138
Okay, but what would really
be help ful right now is

199
00:08:50,158 --> 00:08:53,525
if you just gave us Mr. Gama-Lobo's home address
so that we could go there and interview him.

200
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:56,061
That is not necessary. The man has
been doing this show eight years.

201
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:58,640
His wife left him.
This is his home address.

202
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:05,759
I'm sensing a hair in
the evidence baggie.

203
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:07,372
Man, it just irks me!

204
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:10,175
I still think we should bring in some of
other cast members for questioning.

205
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:12,405
Here's the thing, O'Hara.
It's not that complicated.

206
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:14,445
Motivation, opportunity, execution.

207
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:17,345
With Nunez out of the picture,
Jorge's role on the show gets larger.

208
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:18,230
Motivation.

209
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,085
Knowing in advance that it's scripted that
he would stab Nunez presents opportunity.

210
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:24,599
The fact that he was unmistakably
caught on film actually

211
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:27,375
stabbing the victim, hello, execution.

212
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:30,605
Soon as we get those lab results
back, we'll be done... thank you.

213
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,145
- Who's that?
- Pascoretti, Penny. A newbie.

214
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:35,184
Just transferred in from
the 302 out of Oakland.

215
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:36,065
It's about time.

216
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:37,355
We could use some new blood.

217
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,455
I hate new blood.

218
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:39,420
Of course you do.

219
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,203
I welcome it.

220
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:41,405
Especially new female blood.

221
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:43,345
It gets lonely here in
this sea of testosterone.

222
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,025
Well, you go right ahead,
knock yourself out.

223
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:45,880
Make a new friend.

224
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,860
Maybe you could have a little tea party.

225
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,120
Braid each other's hair, for all I care.

226
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,300
Hello, I'm detective O'Hara,
but you can call me Juliet.

227
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,745
Anyway, I just wanted to introduce
myself, and welcome you here,

228
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:06,735
and let you know if you need any help
with anything, don't hesitate to ask.

229
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:10,650
Does it look like I don't know how
to write my own name and badge number?

230
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,480
Bff's?

231
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,160
Best friends forever?

232
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,995
Shut up, Lassiter.

233
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,545
Mr. Gama-Lobo...

234
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:24,815
we just have a few questions for you.

235
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:26,555
Call me Jorge, please.

236
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:27,595
Jorge?

237
00:10:29,272 --> 00:10:31,403
Come on, that's a little silly.

238
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,685
That's your name. That's cool.

239
00:10:35,946 --> 00:10:37,165
We know you didn't do it.

240
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:38,898
- You do?
- We think you were framed.

241
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,103
This is music to my earlobes.

242
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:44,313
Do you have questions for me?

243
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:45,408
Yes, we do.

244
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:47,530
Do you know if Serena's baby is yours?

245
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:49,436
- What?
- Serena's baby.

246
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:50,468
Gus.

247
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,835
I'm sorry.

248
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,595
Are those meat balls from craft service?

249
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:57,389
Yes, Kelly knows they are my favorite.

250
00:10:57,645 --> 00:11:01,525
Usually I hunger for her meat balls the way
a Jackal Salivates for an injured possum...

251
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:04,278
but Sadly,
I have no appetite for them now.

252
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:06,005
Grab the one doesn't have a fork in it.

253
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:08,144
They're still steaming.
The little... whoa!

254
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,075
Who's this over here?

255
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:11,295
That is my family.

256
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:13,367
Yes, they are all back in Mexico. I,

257
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,142
left them to do the show.

258
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,246
- Your brother.
- It's my sister.

259
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:21,761
No, he means this person right here.

260
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:24,275
Yes, yes. It's my sister.

261
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:27,741
No, he means this one.
Right here.

262
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,252
Where my finger is.

263
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:31,325
Yes, yes. It's my sister.

264
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,633
She is quite lovely.

265
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:37,346
In a young... Keith Hernandez...

266
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,941
sort of... you must miss them very much.

267
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:41,921
Yes

268
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,653
I sense violence.

269
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,620
An altercation.

270
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:56,580
Here, in this room.

271
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:59,829
Someone had something against you.
Here!

272
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,842
Yes. Yes, Quintessa.

273
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:04,505
Quintessa Gabrielle.

274
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:05,975
She plays Corrine on the show.

275
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:07,315
She is Gorgeous.

276
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:08,458
You don't know her wrath.

277
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,735
She hates me.
She's like the latina Susan Lucci.

278
00:12:11,755 --> 00:12:12,801
She beat me up.

279
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:15,645
I hardly think there's
woman capable of that.

280
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:17,105
Bea Arthur.

281
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,215
I stand corrected.

282
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:22,975
Scuse us.

283
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:25,515
Would you please just,
just come out and talk to me?

284
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:26,675
Go away!

285
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:29,549
I promise you, I swear to you,
I will change the line.

286
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:31,428
I was misinformed.

287
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:34,878
There's gotta be another Spanish word
for nipple. Just tell me what it is.

288
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:42,363
Hi, how you doing?

289
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,534
I'm just going to the writers'room
where it's emotionally damaging,

290
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:47,960
but it's physically safe.

291
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:55,269
Let's go after her.

292
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:57,941
Whoa, maybe now isn't the
best time to approach her.

293
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,318
You're right.
We only have a day to solve the case.

294
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:01,818
We should wait and hang out.

295
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:04,715
I'll do the heavy lifting and charm her,
you grab a piece of her hair.

296
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:06,135
Grab a piece of her hair, why?

297
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:08,439
So we can compare it to the
one on the murder weapon.

298
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,362
How am I gonna Graba
piece of her hair, Shawn?

299
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:12,085
I don't know what else I can tell you.

300
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,205
I told the policeman every thing I know.

301
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:15,210
Policeman?

302
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,091
Yes,
the talls curvy-like one with no rhythm.

303
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:19,245
Detective Lassiter?

304
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,536
- Yes, that was his name.
- Were you and Rinaldo Nunez... close?

305
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,685
Well, we were working together, but...

306
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,294
but no,
I didn't know him very well at all.

307
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:30,430
- I'm a professional.
- I see.

308
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,487
Was he ever in your dressing room?

309
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,225
I should say not!

310
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:35,756
That's strange.

311
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,855
I'm seeing him in your dressing room.

312
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,905
Are you a psychic or some kind of witch?

313
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:45,129
Okay...

314
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,473
so
maybe sometimes he came to my

315
00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:51,875
dressing room to rehearse
lines or something.

316
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:53,902
No, he's not running lines.

317
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,555
He's holding a feather duster,
dipping him self in pancake batter.

318
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:58,807
And he's quite naked.

319
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,715
Okay, so she's definitely
boinking Nunez.

320
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:07,205
Does that make her a suspect?

321
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:08,805
Well, she did lie about it.

322
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:09,716
Why?

323
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:11,989
Well, he does wear bikini briefs.

324
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:15,586
Sweet.

325
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:17,448
Dude.

326
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,937
- This isn't a hair.
- What?

327
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:22,742
It's just part of her scrunchie.
Look!

328
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:25,505
It's all elastic-Y.
It's got a piece of be dazzle in it.

329
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:27,525
It's made out of yarn. Good work, Buddy.

330
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:30,021
Forget it, I'll figure out
how to pluck one myself.

331
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:31,902
I think we should split up.

332
00:14:31,922 --> 00:14:34,695
You hit the props department, see what
you can find out about our weapon.

333
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:38,421
I'm gonna pop into the stage and grill lance
about the quintess a Jorge relationship.

334
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:40,776
Jorge.

335
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:53,396
Camera two, push in.

336
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:55,220
Hold it there.

337
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,019
Go.

338
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,956
So this is where all the magic happens?

339
00:14:59,976 --> 00:15:01,573
Yes, smell the dream.

340
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,207
Can I ask you a question? I think...

341
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:09,272
I'm sorry. I'm just gonna watch.

342
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:21,048
What the hell is he doing?
What, does he got a twitch or something?

343
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:23,499
I'm afraid that's called his acting.

344
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:25,345
He's only got a couple of lines.

345
00:15:25,365 --> 00:15:26,673
It's always the bit players.

346
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:27,945
Is he flirting with her?

347
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:29,785
That was the idea.

348
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,982
He should be more subtle than that, man.
Luke,

349
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:35,785
you don't seduce a woman with
your forehead and your Adam's apple.

350
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:38,107
It's right here. It's always been here.

351
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:39,674
It doesn't start there,
you know?

352
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:41,388
I mean, you're over here and then...

353
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:43,265
how would you do the line?

354
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,009
Do... do what?

355
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,455
You know.

356
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,550
No, I can't, whoa, I just...

357
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:50,990
well, that's the thing.

358
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:53,965
Jorge would never have known
that the knife was real.

359
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:56,142
The blades are virtually identical,
actually.

360
00:15:56,423 --> 00:16:00,056
We build the propas close to the specs
of your average six-inch blade as we can.

361
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,353
I mean, we do that, obviously,
for the look of the knife.

362
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:06,222
But also, it gives, like, a realistic feel
for the actor. You know the size, the weight.

363
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:07,853
The texture, so on.

364
00:16:07,906 --> 00:16:10,377
Here, you wanna hold it?
Go on, hold it.

365
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,532
- It feels real.
- But it's not.

366
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:15,053
That's the fake one. See?

367
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:17,700
The blade retracts.
Collapses right into the handle.

368
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:20,680
You wanna try it?

369
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,322
- No, I couldn't.
- Come on, stab me.

370
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:24,365
- No, really, I shouldn't.
- Come on! Go ahead.

371
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:25,775
Hey, it's fun, trust me.

372
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,838
All right.

373
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:31,590
Just messing with you.

374
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,954
Do you mind if I borrow
this to show my partner?

375
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:37,767
It's for the investigation.

376
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,265
Okay, Shawn,
this is what I found out so far.

377
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:50,164
Turns out the knife may have
changed hands up

378
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:52,467
to six times
before Nunez was stabbed with it.

379
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,795
The day is almost up and we've gotten
nowhere. It could be anyone on this set.

380
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,480
We need more access and more time.

381
00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:59,885
I think I've figured outa pretty
good angle for that Buddy.

382
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:02,035
I just need you to step
aside for one second.

383
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,765
Maybe hit the craft service table.

384
00:17:03,785 --> 00:17:05,765
Grab us a couple of those potato latkes.

385
00:17:05,785 --> 00:17:07,965
I can't figure out how Kelly
makes them so crispy.

386
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:09,725
I'm not stepping any where, Shawn.

387
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:11,735
Am I the only one doing any work
here on this case?

388
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:15,056
I'd love to go to work.
I'm ready, I feel it. I just... I can't.

389
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:16,636
Really? And why is that?

390
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:19,254
- You're standing right in my eye line Buddy.
- What?

391
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,405
Quiet on the set!

392
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:28,869
Four, three, two...

393
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,642
and action.

394
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,274
Thanks for coming into speak with us,
Ms. Desmondo.

395
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,543
You're welcome.

396
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,205
I'm gonna get right to it.

397
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,691
Can you recall any in stances in
which you witnessed

398
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:45,265
Jorge Gama-Lobo engaging
in violent behavior?

399
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:46,853
- Yes.
- Yes?

400
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:48,258
Yes.

401
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,383
Please tell us.

402
00:17:49,628 --> 00:17:50,963
It was seven years ago,

403
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:54,015
when he pushed Diego Cabrera off
a Bridge in broad day light.

404
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:55,695
Wait, that happened in this state?

405
00:17:55,715 --> 00:17:57,345
- When was he charged?
- He wasn't.

406
00:17:57,373 --> 00:17:58,473
He beat the rap.

407
00:17:58,618 --> 00:17:59,945
But there was an eye witness.

408
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:02,545
His thought-to-be-missing step brother,
Juan Sandoval.

409
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:03,973
Sandoval, that sounds familiar.

410
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,055
McNab!
Get in here!

411
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,770
I need you to run all
information on a Juan Sandoval.

412
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,140
Juan Sandoval?

413
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,152
Wasn't hey our common law husband?

414
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:19,050
Wait... he was your husband?

415
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:20,103
Common law.

416
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,436
But you murdered himby freezing
his body and then

417
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:25,298
shipping it to Hawaii,
and defrosting it by a Volcano.

418
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:26,365
Exactly.

419
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:28,315
That was fifth season, episode eleven.

420
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:29,440
I'm a fan.

421
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:31,647
Are you two talking about the show?

422
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,225
I'm talking about a real murder.

423
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,955
I actually saw that episode.

424
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:36,885
But he came back in season six, right?

425
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:39,408
As the chief surge on,
so that he could change Velma's face

426
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:42,315
so that you could take the
rap for Beatrice's murder!

427
00:18:45,806 --> 00:18:48,095
It's the only episode I saw.

428
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,020
Who writes this crap?

429
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,145
The writers are all so
color fuland brilliant.

430
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,199
They're wonderful
with the brutal crimes.

431
00:18:54,315 --> 00:18:56,789
They are some kind of geniuses, I swear.

432
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:59,521
Some kind of murder geniuses maybe.

433
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:05,702
<i>I have a package for you...</i>

434
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,281
<i>... special delivery</i>

435
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:09,695
<i>It says...</i>

436
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,131
<i>...'handle with care'</i>

437
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,025
He's really got something, am I right?

438
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:25,600
Yes, he's my muse.

439
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,631
Cut.

440
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,783
Easy!

441
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:33,699
That's what happens when
you hire people off the street.

442
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:35,985
She's sweet.

443
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:38,525
Sweet like Mariah Carey on a Bender.

444
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:39,905
- How'd that look?
- Okay.

445
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:42,687
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I think it lacked some passion.

446
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,028
- Passion.
- Yes.

447
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:47,016
Do you have any idea how
many pages we shot today? 83.

448
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,175
And I'm getting by with the Spanish
I learned from Charo on love boat.

449
00:19:50,195 --> 00:19:51,645
Plus I gotta make it look passionate?

450
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:53,017
And look for clues?

451
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:54,529
Don't get me wrong.

452
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:56,352
I'm pulling it off quite Nicely.

453
00:19:56,547 --> 00:19:58,196
I got a hair off quintessa's head.

454
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,861
- Because our dressing rooms, side by side.
- Nice.

455
00:20:00,881 --> 00:20:03,855
How many times do you two need to be
told you are not needed on this case?

456
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:06,710
You are wasting the
department's resources.

457
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,060
Hey, pal!

458
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,090
Please escort these two off the premises.

459
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:15,655
- Well, uh...
- Uh is not an action word.

460
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:18,295
Now drop the Joe and
take them out of here.

461
00:20:18,415 --> 00:20:20,815
Well, actually, this
coffee's for Mr. Spencer.

462
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:22,995
- Thank you, Roger.
- Mr. Spencer?

463
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:26,180
- Well, uh, Chad, I guess.
- What?

464
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,895
Here, these pineapple peking
dumplings are special for you, Chad.

465
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:33,370
Thank you, Kelly, you sweet little thing.

466
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,755
No. No.

467
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,140
No. No, no, no, no.

468
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,775
I'm going to have to ask
you to leave the stage area.

469
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:46,240
- We're about to roll.
- You don't wanna touch me.

470
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:47,861
Roger, it's okay.

471
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,520
Before you go...

472
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,905
you might want to send this down
to your boys at the lab.

473
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:55,125
It's a hair off Quintessa
Gabrielle's head.

474
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:59,345
The same color and lengt has the
one found on the murder weapon.

475
00:20:59,465 --> 00:21:02,375
I think you'll find it's
a sweet, sweet match.

476
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:04,962
Oh, yes. I'll get right on that.

477
00:21:06,112 --> 00:21:08,752
- Why would you do that?
- The hair from the knife was synthetic.

478
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:11,251
It came from a wig. Quintessa
Gabrielle's hair is real.

479
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,536
So there's no match. But...

480
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:15,366
nice work. Chad.

481
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,652
What kind of show do you think
we're doing? Gotta keep it grounded,

482
00:21:21,772 --> 00:21:24,107
you gotta keep it real. Wanna go back
to being an intern?

483
00:21:24,494 --> 00:21:26,925
Excuse me, I am doing
something here. Not nothing.

484
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:30,705
She's already making love to her
nephew. She can't also be a nun.

485
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:32,645
Yes, can I help you? Very quickly.

486
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:36,245
I have a warrant to search these premises,
confiscate all scripts and written material.

487
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:37,605
On what grounds?

488
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:41,710
On the grounds you've all been very busy
thinking up ingenious ways to kill people.

489
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:52,660
All that, plus the latest in local sports
with Dan the man, coming up at 11:00 P.M.

490
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,755
The package is for you, Mrs...

491
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,745
... Lourdes.

492
00:22:00,865 --> 00:22:03,230
It's Ms, Please.

493
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,055
- What the hell?
- Well, in that case...

494
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:08,860
... sign here.

495
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:18,635
- Jorge Gama-Lobo tried to kill himself?
- Tried and failed.

496
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,665
Must have been so wracked with guilt over
stabbing Nunez, he decided to off himself.

497
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:23,113
- Did he leave a note?
- Oh, yeah.

498
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,065
Admitting to the murder. It's already
with the boys down at the lab.

499
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:27,326
I just wanted to get in
there, get a verbal confession.

500
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,685
You've got to be kidding me.

501
00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:35,070
Step away from the bed now!

502
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:36,955
Don't you shush me!

503
00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:41,575
I was about to say there's still time for you to
go downstairs to the gift shop and buy something.

504
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:44,102
- Maybe a teddy bear.
- Oh, that's nice.

505
00:22:44,222 --> 00:22:45,435
Teddy bears are cute.

506
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:48,625
They have one with a jar of
honey that says, "bee well. "

507
00:22:48,745 --> 00:22:52,124
I mean it, this time I will arrest
you for interfering in police business.

508
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:53,745
I'm gonna have to ask you two to leave.

509
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:56,614
- This man is very sick, and I need quiet in here.
-  Us?

510
00:22:56,735 --> 00:23:00,792
Excuse me, I'm detective O'Hara and this is
detective Lassiter and we're investigating this man.

511
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,245
And I demand you remove these
men from this room.

512
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:08,115
Honey, the only people actually authorized
to be in here are Mr. Spencer and Mr. Guster.

513
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:11,025
They're on Mr. Gama-Lobo's friends
and family list.

514
00:23:11,145 --> 00:23:14,820
- Everyone else... out.
- You just met him a week ago.

515
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,988
His whole family is back in Mexico.
His older brother misses him very much.

516
00:23:19,108 --> 00:23:21,060
- His sister.
- Right.

517
00:23:21,378 --> 00:23:24,040
How does he make friends so fast?

518
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:30,995
I get that Jorge was depressed about being
off the show, but murder/suicide/coma?

519
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:34,200
This whole thing is starting to
feel like a real soap opera to me.

520
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,305
I can't believe he
would take his own life.

521
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,255
Unless he was wearing a wig...

522
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,910
he didn't.

523
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,660
Someone else did.

524
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,490
What?

525
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,844
I don't get it.

526
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,487
Really?

527
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,415
I thought I wrapped it up so
nicely for you just now.

528
00:24:00,535 --> 00:24:02,920
It felt really good. It was organic.

529
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,115
Synthetic hair.

530
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:12,990
Just like the one found on the knife.

531
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,673
So?

532
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,900
Dude.

533
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,445
It means the same person was there...

534
00:24:22,565 --> 00:24:24,880
when Jorge tried "to kill himself. "

535
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,849
He wasn't alone.

536
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,900
So wait... you're saying

537
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,587
- he didn't try to kill himself?
- I can't do this.

538
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,735
You're not being clear, Shawn.

539
00:24:37,855 --> 00:24:39,245
Come on, dude.

540
00:24:39,365 --> 00:24:40,965
I gave it to you three different ways.

541
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:43,540
Did he or did he not
try to kill himself?

542
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:50,464
Is that the Gama-Lobo suicide note?

543
00:24:50,584 --> 00:24:52,685
Yes, but I'm still waiting on the
hand writing samples from the lab.

544
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:54,515
Nah, forget that. Just read it to me.

545
00:24:54,635 --> 00:25:00,215
Okay, "dear world, I ask for forgiveness "for
the sins I have committed against humanity.

546
00:25:00,335 --> 00:25:03,682
"It was my hands...
that carried out a heinous murder. "

547
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,094
Wait a minute.

548
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,324
Hold on a second.

549
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,142
- I know that.
- You know that?

550
00:25:10,262 --> 00:25:13,500
I have been literally poring
over these things for days.

551
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,988
Hold on a second.

552
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,210
Okay, continue.

553
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,625
"How can I go back and reverse time?

554
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:25,865
"I have no choice but to say good-bye "

555
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:30,340
to a world I turned my back
on and the woman I betrayed. "

556
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:34,031
- Wow, it's from a script?
- Word for word.

557
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,035
Written by Lance Rothstein.

558
00:25:37,155 --> 00:25:38,818
So Lance set him up.

559
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,965
What, did he just get lazy? Did
he think no one would remember?

560
00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:45,580
He's gonna have plenty of time to
figure out new plot lines behind bars.

561
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,625
So this is what it
feels like to be in jail.

562
00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:53,925
I always wondered if I'd survive.

563
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:55,867
- I was in jail once.
- Really...

564
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,050
this is what it
was like for you too?

565
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,715
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

566
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:03,795
You know, I mean, these
phones aren't real.

567
00:26:03,915 --> 00:26:05,945
No, course not. I mean, you
know, it would be too expensive.

568
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,615
But I mean for Ernesto's prison
scene tomorrow, it's great, right?

569
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:09,855
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

570
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:12,576
Lance Rothstein, you're under arrest.

571
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,480
- For what?
- The murder of Rinaldo Nunez.

572
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:17,735
Don't worry, I can get
you off on that one.

573
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:21,510
And the attempted
murder of Jorge Gama-Lobo.

574
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,120
Ooh, I don't know about that one.

575
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,505
Don't get up. I'm not staying.

576
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:40,595
We just had a huge breakin that
murder case I was working on.

577
00:26:40,715 --> 00:26:42,425
So now the paperwork.

578
00:26:42,545 --> 00:26:45,140
I just wanted to stop by and...

579
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,970
give you this.

580
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,535
What is that?

581
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:50,780
- A cupcake.
- I can see that but

582
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,675
why are you giving it to me?

583
00:26:52,795 --> 00:26:58,465
I noticed that you were eating one with your lunch
the other day, so I stopped and bought you one.

584
00:26:58,585 --> 00:26:59,855
Same kind, red velvet.

585
00:26:59,975 --> 00:27:01,785
You, um... you noticed what
I was eating.

586
00:27:01,905 --> 00:27:04,490
Well, yeah, I'm a detective.

587
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,320
- I notice details.
- Really?

588
00:27:06,811 --> 00:27:08,605
What else did you notice about me?

589
00:27:08,725 --> 00:27:12,695
Well, I notice that you
eat by yourself every day.

590
00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:16,205
I notice that you hesitate to
make eye contact with people.

591
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:18,455
And, well, you can...

592
00:27:18,575 --> 00:27:20,525
be a little abrasive.

593
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:23,385
But, you know, that's probably
just because it's hard to adapt.

594
00:27:23,505 --> 00:27:25,325
You know, lots of politics.

595
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:27,735
It's hard to understand where
everyone's coming from.

596
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:28,875
Don't worry.

597
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:32,265
I think I'm getting a pretty good idea.

598
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:33,805
Good.

599
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:35,660
I'm glad.

600
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,945
Dad! You're here!

601
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:45,285
I am.

602
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:46,835
You have to try this sandwich.

603
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:49,952
- Kelly from craft service makes them for me.
- I already ate lunch, Shawn. Why am I here?

604
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:51,105
This isn't lunch.

605
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:54,635
This is turkey... with
stuffing and cranberry.

606
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:57,635
It's like thanks giving between
two slices of bread.

607
00:27:57,755 --> 00:28:00,565
This whole place is like
leaving Las Vegas with food.

608
00:28:00,685 --> 00:28:02,235
Shawn, why'd you ask me here?

609
00:28:02,355 --> 00:28:03,725
I thought you'd enjoy it.

610
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:07,485
You said you never had the opportunity to visit me when
I was working a real job, and now I have a real job!

611
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:09,842
- Shawn, this is not a real job.
- Sure it is.

612
00:28:09,962 --> 00:28:13,136
Oh no, I think I got make-upon
this t-shirt. Has anyone seen Ivan?

613
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,291
Acting is not a real job, Shawn. I mean,
how much attention do you need?

614
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,640
I'm not doing this for the attention.

615
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,255
I happen to be solving a case.

616
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:25,378
A murder. This is serious business.
I've got a guy sitting in jail.

617
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:28,035
Lassiter's got some evidence against
him, but I know he didn't do it.

618
00:28:28,155 --> 00:28:30,425
It doesn't make any sense. He's
a writer. He's got no motive.

619
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:33,610
Well, motive is everything.
No motive, no conviction.

620
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,325
How do you have fans?

621
00:28:35,445 --> 00:28:37,975
This is asinine. You started
on the show five days ago.

622
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:39,586
- Look, I have something.
- Did you ever think

623
00:28:39,706 --> 00:28:41,485
that maybe this is embarrassing for me?

624
00:28:41,605 --> 00:28:43,830
- Embarrassing for you?
- First off, your accent is terrible.

625
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,095
It's disgraceful, really.

626
00:28:45,215 --> 00:28:47,325
You sound like that el pollo loco guy.

627
00:28:47,445 --> 00:28:49,395
And then, there you go, turning
your back on Rinaldo,

628
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:53,365
even after he defended you when you were
accused of Maria's kidnapping... come on.

629
00:28:53,485 --> 00:28:57,105
First of all, I am trying to
sound like the el pollo loco guy.

630
00:28:57,225 --> 00:29:00,205
And secondly, Rinaldo turned his back on
me when he slept with Maria in the first place.

631
00:29:00,325 --> 00:29:02,593
Oh, come on, he would have given
you half the reward money!

632
00:29:02,713 --> 00:29:06,825
Where's your integrity? It makes
you look like such a bad person.

633
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,125
I'm Shawn.

634
00:29:08,245 --> 00:29:09,955
Those are things that
my character Chad did.

635
00:29:10,075 --> 00:29:11,625
I play him on tv.

636
00:29:11,745 --> 00:29:14,240
It's Shawn. Shawny.

637
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,580
Look into your boy's eyes.

638
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,265
It's me, papa.

639
00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:21,285
Don't be an idiot. I'm
not one of your fans.

640
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:23,285
I barely even like you.

641
00:29:23,405 --> 00:29:24,885
That's it.

642
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:29,665
If my own father can blur the lines between
the show and reality, why couldn't someone else?

643
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:32,695
We've been looking in the wrong place.

644
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:34,905
It's fans.

645
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:38,665
Okay, so you've narrowed it
down to 150 suspects.

646
00:29:38,785 --> 00:29:40,205
Good work, Shawn.

647
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:42,155
I want your baby!

648
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:43,655
I want your baby!

649
00:29:43,775 --> 00:29:46,689
I don't have any female fans?
Listen, Lance.

650
00:29:46,815 --> 00:29:48,835
Lassiter doesn't have enough
to make this arrest stick.

651
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:51,765
He's just hoping that a couple nights
in jail will get you to confess.

652
00:29:51,885 --> 00:29:53,435
A couple nights? No, no, no, no.

653
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:55,240
Here's the thing.

654
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,565
I actually like it in here.

655
00:29:57,685 --> 00:30:00,105
This is fuel for the
show. It's fuel for me.

656
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:02,025
I always felt there was something
holding me back as a writer.

657
00:30:02,145 --> 00:30:05,305
I grew up in Beverly Hills. And
I always felt that I lacked any...

658
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:07,285
real life experience.

659
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,225
Shawn, this is so good for me.

660
00:30:09,345 --> 00:30:12,925
It's like heming way, like
Ellroy, Steinbeck. Danielle Steel.

661
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,205
- Ethan Hawke.
- Judy Blume.

662
00:30:15,711 --> 00:30:19,990
Exactly. I can wallow in the harsh
under belly of prison life.

663
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,655
And shake it up a little
bit with the riff-raff.

664
00:30:22,775 --> 00:30:24,555
Uh, the riff-raff?

665
00:30:24,675 --> 00:30:26,205
This is the Santa Barbara jail.

666
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,395
Not San Quentin.

667
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:31,045
It was written up in fodor's last
year as a nice spa alternative.

668
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:33,935
We need to get you out of here so you
can write the show. Everyone needs you.

669
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:35,945
No, no, no, I can write in here.

670
00:30:36,065 --> 00:30:41,664
I can scratch it out with a broken piece
of lead in the dark. And then I can...

671
00:30:41,795 --> 00:30:45,785
bury myself in the one non-down pillow they
issued meand I can cry myself to sleep.

672
00:30:45,905 --> 00:30:48,285
Look, we need to talk about Corrine.

673
00:30:48,405 --> 00:30:49,905
- Corrine?
- Corrine.

674
00:30:50,025 --> 00:30:52,431
- Oh, Corrine.
- Yes, it came to me in a vision.

675
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,755
The murderer is doing
this to protect her.

676
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,155
Think about it.

677
00:30:56,275 --> 00:30:57,995
First, Ernesto cheated on her.

678
00:30:58,115 --> 00:30:59,315
And was stabbed and killed.

679
00:30:59,435 --> 00:31:04,310
Then you wrote that Vincente be trayed
her and went missing. Someone...

680
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,315
took it into their own
hands and tried to kill him.

681
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:09,945
Well, not Vincente, but Jorge.

682
00:31:10,065 --> 00:31:11,165
That's my point.

683
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:13,285
They can't tell the difference.

684
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:16,070
- It's a fan.
- That's interesting.

685
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:18,545
I'm not disagreeing, but what's act two?

686
00:31:18,665 --> 00:31:22,545
I mean, let's say it is just one fan. How
you gonna find one fan among thousands?

687
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:24,875
Easy. That's where you come in.

688
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:28,715
You just write me a storyline where
I put Corrine's life in Jeopardy.

689
00:31:28,835 --> 00:31:31,115
Then we won't have to go
looking for the murderer.

690
00:31:31,235 --> 00:31:34,240
The murderer will come looking for me.

691
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,945
Ow! Again?

692
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:43,390
Why?

693
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,890
You wanted to see me, chief?

694
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,115
Is there a problem?

695
00:31:51,235 --> 00:31:52,525
Did the Rothstein arrest not stick?

696
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:55,000
This isn't about the Nunez case.

697
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,595
This is about the new
transfer, Penny Pascoretti.

698
00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:00,185
Wanted to hear your side.

699
00:32:00,305 --> 00:32:02,528
My side? My side of what?

700
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:05,675
Well, I don't know a
delicate way to put this.

701
00:32:05,795 --> 00:32:08,975
Ms. Pascoretti has filed an interdepartmental
harassment charge against you.

702
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,035
What? That's outrageous!

703
00:32:11,155 --> 00:32:14,130
Is there any truth to this claim?

704
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,295
I was just being nice.

705
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:18,915
Reaching out. I bought her a cupcake.

706
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:20,960
- Sue me.
- She is.

707
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,295
What do you mean you
bought her a cupcake?

708
00:32:23,415 --> 00:32:27,985
With this piece of information, you're lucky
the charge didn't include a stalking claim.

709
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:30,815
I was just trying to make a friend.

710
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:33,875
I'm going to give you a
piece of advice. And take it.

711
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:39,045
As a woman in this department, you have to be
very careful how you go about forming friendships.

712
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:45,080
Women in the line of police work are more cautious
by nature and necessity, and slow to trust.

713
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,575
Well, if that's the case, I guess no
woman has a friend in the department.

714
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:50,830
That's right.

715
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,245
Oh, 'cause I kind of
thought we were friends.

716
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:57,410
Well, you were wrong.

717
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,665
I'll talk to Ms. Pascoretti and see
what I can do to mitigate these charges.

718
00:33:00,785 --> 00:33:04,890
But in the meantime, stop
buying pastries.

719
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,500
You're excused.

720
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,850
Nice blouse.

721
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,175
Thanks.

722
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:16,805
I got it at nord strom, it
was on the sale rack.

723
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:18,685
- I probably shouldn't.
- I don't care.

724
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:21,390
But you asked
enough, O'Hara. Goodbye.

725
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,485
We have a problem.

726
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:40,165
The show's fallen behind.

727
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:45,275
And the network says the only way we can stay
on schedule is if we do the show on friday, live.

728
00:33:45,395 --> 00:33:47,705
Which means we need a script tonight!

729
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,638
- Is that possible?
- Are you kidding me?

730
00:33:49,758 --> 00:33:53,290
- I've never been more inspired in my life.
- Sweet! Here's the catch.

731
00:33:53,415 --> 00:33:55,375
Now that you've had me cheat on Corrine,

732
00:33:55,495 --> 00:34:00,275
I need you to put out new pages, with a new murder
weapon, and a scene where Corrine comes after me.

733
00:34:00,395 --> 00:34:01,875
That's a terrible pitch.
Why would I do that?

734
00:34:01,995 --> 00:34:05,615
Because, Lance, the murderer's going
to try and finish the job.

735
00:34:05,735 --> 00:34:07,605
Whoever it is has access to the scripts

736
00:34:07,725 --> 00:34:10,175
and will be paying very
close attention to the murder weapon

737
00:34:10,295 --> 00:34:12,685
and will likely tamper with it tomorrow.

738
00:34:12,805 --> 00:34:14,580
But I'll be there to catch them.

739
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,075
All right, Spencer, I trust you're confident this
elaborate charade is going to be fruitful for the case?

740
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,595
Confidence is not my problem.

741
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:28,369
Dry lips, however...
Pearl, make it nice for the kissers.

742
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,807
Mr. Spencer, we're ready for you on set.
We're moments away from going live.

743
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:33,525
Okay, so what's our plan?

744
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:36,425
Well, Lance wrote this long monologue
for Corrine after my exit.

745
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:40,075
That gives me plenty of time to make my
costume change, so I'll meet you backstage then.

746
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:42,905
- Keep your eyes peeled for anything suspicious.
- Got it.

747
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:46,340
We're seconds away from
live! Places, everybody, places!

748
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,435
In four... three... two...

749
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:51,050
and... go!

750
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,430
Darling, you looking lovely...

751
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,395
... but we should get going...

752
00:35:07,515 --> 00:35:09,655
... if we are going to make it...

753
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,800
... to Serena's charity ball.

754
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,745
Tell me, Chad.

755
00:35:13,865 --> 00:35:16,565
Do I look fat in this ball gown?

756
00:35:16,685 --> 00:35:18,640
You look like a...

757
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,575
... sweet nectarine...

758
00:35:21,695 --> 00:35:24,630
... wrapped in taffeta.

759
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,995
I didn't write that.

760
00:35:27,146 --> 00:35:30,040
- Improvisation. I like it.
- Yes.

761
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,865
Well, I need you to be a dear...

762
00:35:32,985 --> 00:35:35,225
... and after you get your suit on...

763
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:36,885
... will you grab...

764
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:39,280
... my nail gun?

765
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,215
What?

766
00:35:41,335 --> 00:35:45,490
You're taking a nail gun...

767
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,580
... to Serena's charity ball?

768
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,025
No, Silly.

769
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:54,265
The shelf has been loose...

770
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,830
... for a while now...

771
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,740
... and I need to fix it.

772
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,770
But now my little rabbit?

773
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:05,671
Yes.

774
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,595
Be a love...

775
00:36:07,715 --> 00:36:09,940
... and look for it in the garage.

776
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,910
Okay.

777
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,970
Oh, this can't be good.

778
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,185
Dude, did anyone come near the prop table?

779
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:21,375
What prop table?

780
00:36:21,495 --> 00:36:24,615
I've been glued to the tv, watching for
anything suspicious to happen, like you said.

781
00:36:24,735 --> 00:36:26,785
Dude, you're just standing there
eating a meat ball, watching the show.

782
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:28,425
You're supposed to be
watching the prop table!

783
00:36:28,545 --> 00:36:30,785
You never said anything about
a prop table, Shawn.

784
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:34,595
If you would a said watch the prop table,
I would have been watching the prop table.

785
00:36:34,715 --> 00:36:37,032
Whoever tampered with
that nail gun is our killer, Gus.

786
00:36:37,152 --> 00:36:40,920
- We're talking about my life here!
- I know, Shawn. This woman is crazy.

787
00:36:41,797 --> 00:36:44,855
- She's gonna kill you.
- Look, forget it, okay? Just forget it.

788
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:46,735
I'll check the nail gun myself.

789
00:36:46,855 --> 00:36:50,595
Do me a favor, and save me one
of those meat balls, yeah?

790
00:36:50,715 --> 00:36:52,575
Let's go. You gotta get out there.

791
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,183
This is no time for pranks, Roger. There's
still half a scene before I make my entrance.

792
00:36:56,303 --> 00:37:00,740
Not anymore. She's all over the place. She
just skipped ahead three pages. You're on!

793
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,870
- Gus?
- Be strong, Shawn.

794
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,430
... he will be dead.

795
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,770
Oh! There you are, my dear.

796
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,360
Here, hand me the nail gun.

797
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,405
Okay... here you go.

798
00:37:21,525 --> 00:37:24,965
But do not point this at
me, because es mucho dangerioso.

799
00:37:25,085 --> 00:37:26,605
I know that, my darling.

800
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:30,057
You say that you know, but seriously.
Be very carefulio.

801
00:37:30,177 --> 00:37:34,120
You could morte me with this thing
because it is realio as it gets!

802
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,055
I love the improv. The passion.

803
00:37:36,175 --> 00:37:37,620
Not an improv!

804
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,345
Of course it's real...

805
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:42,145
... as real as you cheating on me...

806
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:44,365
... with my sister Serena...

807
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:47,135
... and getting her pregnant.

808
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:49,145
Shawn is the father of Serena's baby!

809
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:51,565
Please put that down, woman, it's
loaded with real nails!

810
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:52,935
And it's you...

811
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:54,785
... that killed Vincente.

812
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,570
Shawn, watch out! Watch out!

813
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,320
No!

814
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,725
You are wrong!

815
00:38:09,845 --> 00:38:11,865
I am not a murderer-o!

816
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:14,185
But I know who is-O.

817
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:17,480
Yes... your twin sister.

818
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,475
I don't have a twin sister.

819
00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:26,490
Yes, what I mean is, it's someone
who wants to be your twin sister.

820
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,315
Someone who wants to be you!

821
00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:32,879
- I definitely did not write this.
- Okay, I don't get it.

822
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:35,395
No, it's like, eh...

823
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:37,285
Beautiful girls...

824
00:38:37,405 --> 00:38:39,145
... drinking...

825
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:40,725
... beer on the beach...

826
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:43,480
- My god, he's improvising.
- ... with... homicide...

827
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,825
I... can't do this!

828
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:48,690
Uh, you make a translation for me, yeah?

829
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,070
Ah, high school spanish comes
back to haunt him.

830
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,415
She did it!

831
00:38:55,535 --> 00:38:57,980
Pan over. Pan over!

832
00:39:01,315 --> 00:39:03,565
After all that, you
just point at the murderer?

833
00:39:03,685 --> 00:39:05,754
Don't you have any sense of
dramatic tension or build?

834
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:09,355
Come on, what are we, on blossom? No!
You start by saying she was your biggest fan.

835
00:39:09,475 --> 00:39:12,105
You know, that she practically worships
you. She read all the scripts.

836
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,745
I got this, I got
this... you! Yes, you!

837
00:39:14,865 --> 00:39:17,985
You hated it whenever Corinne
was put into Jeopardy.

838
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,145
So you took it up on
yourself to avenge her.

839
00:39:21,265 --> 00:39:22,735
I had to.

840
00:39:22,855 --> 00:39:24,705
She cares too much.

841
00:39:24,825 --> 00:39:27,510
Her heart is too big for her chest.

842
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:32,250
When Ernes to cheated on her, she
was too weak to stand up for herself.

843
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,655
I needed to help her.

844
00:39:34,775 --> 00:39:36,855
She was like my best friend.

845
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:39,200
- I barely spoke to her.
- Really?

846
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:43,915
So it was you who replaced the
retractable prop knife with the real one!

847
00:39:44,035 --> 00:39:45,445
And he deserved it.

848
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:51,265
And it was also you who poisoned poor Vincente
after it was written that he betrayed Corinne.

849
00:39:51,385 --> 00:39:53,375
- But how?
- With a meat ball.

850
00:39:53,495 --> 00:39:58,435
Usually I hunger for her meat balls the way
a jackal salivates for an injured possum.

851
00:39:58,555 --> 00:40:00,085
But he wrote a suicide note.

852
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:01,455
No, he didn't.

853
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:04,340
You should have a degree in
being wrong all the time.

854
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,755
And she almost got away with it!

855
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,575
If it was not for the hairs.

856
00:40:08,695 --> 00:40:10,475
- The hairs?
- Yes, the hairs.

857
00:40:10,595 --> 00:40:16,335
From the cheap imitation wig that you put on to
emulate Corinne when you committed these murders!

858
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,495
Yes, I did it!

859
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:21,006
- And now it's your turn to die.
- Say what?

860
00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:24,765
For sleeping with Serena when
all Corinne did was love you.

861
00:40:24,885 --> 00:40:26,510
She's right about that.

862
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,540
Easy, you psycho! Put it down. Let go!

863
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,250
Hello.

864
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,025
My name is...

865
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:46,240
... Inspector Carlton Lassiter.

866
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,290
I like cheese.

867
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,155
Really? That's what you choose to say?

868
00:40:53,275 --> 00:40:56,770
I only took it for two
years in junior high. Watch out.

869
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,610
It had to be done.

870
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,300
I will miss him.

871
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,945
But you tried to kill him.

872
00:41:19,065 --> 00:41:20,735
Yes. But...

873
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:23,590
... I'll love him the rest of my life.
