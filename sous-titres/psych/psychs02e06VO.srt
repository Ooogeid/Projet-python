1
00:00:13,168 --> 00:00:14,300
Good morning, dad.

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,735
I made you some of your favorite
bana nut muffins.

3
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:20,052
I had trying to get un-grounded before
robocop comes out on friday?

4
00:00:20,784 --> 00:00:23,536
Did I mention I made them
all by myself?

5
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:25,300
Mm, not bad.

6
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:28,379
- What recipe did you use?
- My recipe?

7
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:33,100
Uh, I can't tell you that.
Um, it's a secret.

8
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:34,575
Well, let me see if I can guess

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,124
some of the ingredients
that you put in here.

10
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:39,340
Is that a hint of cinnamon
that I'm tasting?

11
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,143
Oh, yeah, just a little.

12
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:47,729
And I'm detecting just a touch of
cilantro... and thyme. Am I right?

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,128
- Whoa, dad, you're really sharp.
- Yeah, I am.

14
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:54,890
Gus, you want to come out
of the pantry?

15
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:03,515
Shawn, what have I told you
1,000 times before?

16
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:05,581
Don't hide Gus in the pantry?

17
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:09,496
No! A lie always leads to more lies.

18
00:01:09,982 --> 00:01:11,800
Instead of lying to me
about baking these yourself,

19
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,865
and then lying to me
about your secret ingredients

20
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:16,141
that you put in, you should
have just said that Gus

21
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:18,992
baked these muffins, and I might
have let you off the hook.

22
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:21,564
- Who said Gus made them?
- Go to your room.

23
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:23,520
- I don't know where that is.
- Shawn...

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,687
Who's Shawn?

25
00:01:31,544 --> 00:01:33,212
Public parking, huh?

26
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:36,240
Nice to know that
my first visit to Santa Barbara

27
00:01:36,273 --> 00:01:38,411
isn't a good enough reason
for you to pop for a couple

28
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:39,565
of extra bucks for the valet.

29
00:01:39,598 --> 00:01:41,742
The restaurant doesn't have
valet parking, uncle Burton.

30
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:44,013
Am I gonna need tokens
to use the bathroom?

31
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:45,935
It's been well reviewed...
It got four spoons.

32
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:47,714
Crack spoons,
from the sound of it.

33
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:50,124
- Gus, wait up.
- Shawn?

34
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:53,834
Finally. You know, I went
to two comic book stores

35
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:57,961
and three women's volleyball games looking
for you. Luckily your phone has gps.

36
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,539
- You tracked me?
- Yes, I did.

37
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,808
With a little help from my friends
at your wireless service provider.

38
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:04,344
By the way, they might be calling.

39
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:06,245
They think you're a fugitive
from justice.

40
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:07,845
Run with it.

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,104
- Who is this, Burton?
- Shawn Spencer.

42
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:11,724
He knows who you are,
he knows what you do.

43
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:14,488
Don't speak. We're going to dinner.
You're not invited.

44
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:17,457
- Let's roll, uncle Burton.
- Uh, Jules just called...

45
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:19,032
We've got a case. We should go.

46
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:22,535
You know, Shawn, maybe you should
handle this one yourself.

47
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:24,259
There's a first time
for everything.

48
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:26,812
First time for...
What are you talking about?

49
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,956
Sorry, Shawn, I can't make it.

50
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:33,304
For crying out loud, Burton,
the cops are handing you a case.

51
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,788
You've gotta take it. You're the only
psychic detective they've got.

52
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,588
- That's very funny.
- Don't speak.

53
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:40,625
- Just one minute.
- Yeah.

54
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:42,516
I know what you're thinking.

55
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,700
Of course you do,
you're a psychic detective.

56
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,538
A few months ago I was on the phone

57
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:49,895
with my great aunt, who's hard of hearing,
and pretty much out of it in general.

58
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:54,051
I told her I was working part-time
at a psychic detective agency.

59
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,559
She must've misunderstood
because now everybody

60
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,544
on my mom's side of the family thinks
that I'm a psychic detective...

61
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:02,355
And... you're gay.

62
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:03,045
- No.
- German?

63
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:03,885
- No.
- Invisible.

64
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:05,012
My assistant, Shawn.

65
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:11,349
- Gus, this is, uh...
- Wow! I know. It's a mess.

66
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:13,338
Why don't you just tell him it
was a simple misunderstanding?

67
00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:14,377
It's too late.

68
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:16,510
I can't come clean now
without everyone thinking

69
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:17,936
that I lied to them
in the first place.

70
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:22,114
Plus, uncle Burton has had it out for me
ever since he started going by "Gus,"

71
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:23,363
even though I'm names after him.

72
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:26,183
If he figures out that I'm not psychic,
he's gonna make it his mission

73
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:28,553
- to destroy me in front of everybody.
- All right, say no more.

74
00:03:28,564 --> 00:03:32,476
- You're not getting destroyed by that man.
- I'm getting hungry over here.

75
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:35,890
- Don't worry, I have a plan.
- You do.

76
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:37,213
Uncle Burton.

77
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,478
How would you like to come with us,
and watch your nephew in action?

78
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:46,537
Tag along with you guys
on a real detective case? Yeah.

79
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,910
Hey, maybe this won't be
the most boring vacation

80
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,539
in the world after all. Maybe.

81
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:56,913
I can't wait to watch you work
your psychic magic.

82
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:01,389

89
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,631
So, how you feeling, buddy?
A little nervous?

90
00:04:26,686 --> 00:04:28,300
Feel something happening in the belly?

91
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,741
Maybe you should do
some of your lamaze breathing.

92
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,532
No, you know why, Shawn?

93
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:34,835
Because your little plan to
embarrass me isn't gonna work.

94
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,161
As soon as the cops see
uncle Burton hanging around,

95
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:40,652
they're gonna kick him right out.
Nice try, Shawny boy.

96
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:43,458
- Hey, guys.
- Ah, Buzz.

97
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:46,618
You know, I'm not sure they're gonna
want you having any guests in here.

98
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,551
I mean, since it's
a crime scene and all.

99
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:50,148
- No, it's not.
- It's not?

100
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:53,674
No. There's no crime-scene
tape at the door,

101
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:56,456
the forensic guys are not
collecting any evidence,

102
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:58,790
and it seems as though you guys
don't suspect foul play,

103
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:01,098
so I've got as much right
to be here as you do.

104
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:04,010
And don't give me any of that
fancy police talk, please.

105
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,037
I've seen enough hill street blues
to know what's what.

106
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:10,277
I gotta go.

107
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:16,465
Hey, thanks for coming so quick.
Who's this?

108
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:18,614
This is my uncle Burton,
from New Jersey.

109
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:20,117
Shawn invited him.

110
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,337
Very nice to meet you,
uncle... Burton?

111
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,400
His mother named him after me.

112
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:28,725
It's not a very common name, but
some of us still use it proudly.

113
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:31,648
Jules, what's the skinny?
What do you got?

114
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:34,024
Vince Wagner,
longtime restaurant critic

115
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:36,699
at the Santa Barbara mirror,
died suddenly after eating

116
00:05:36,743 --> 00:05:39,893
his wife's chicken soup.
All signs point to natural causes,

117
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:42,640
but the wife's acting
a little suspicious.

118
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:44,154
I want to make sure
I didn't miss anything,

119
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:45,988
so I'd like for you
to get a reading on her.

120
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:49,307
- Then that's what we will do.
- She's in the den.

121
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:54,802
Finally a chance to see
Gus' psychic powers at work.

122
00:05:54,846 --> 00:05:56,945
Shawn, can I speak to you
for a second?

123
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:59,523
- What is the problem here?
- Stop playing, Shawn...

124
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:00,557
You know I can't do this!

125
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:01,771
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

126
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:03,815
You make some observations,
you form a conclusion,

127
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:06,287
and you reveal it to everybody
in a ridiculous and/or roundabout way.

128
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,486
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.

129
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:22,857
Raw chicken next to vegetables,
charred pots, and a refrigerator

130
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:24,028
full of take-out containers.

131
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:25,619
What does that tell you
about the wife?

132
00:06:25,674 --> 00:06:28,119
I don't know. She sucks at cooking.

133
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:29,345
- Oh, you're on fire.
- What?

134
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,137
Uncle Burton, come quick...
It's happening!

135
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:32,780
Shawn, stop it. Stop playing!

136
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:34,448
Put your hand to your head.
It really helps sell the thing.

137
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,900
I'm not doing it, Shawn.

138
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:38,015
This better be worth
skipping dinner for.

139
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:39,938
He's a psychic wildebeest.

140
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,213
I'm... I'm seeing something.

141
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:48,291
I'm sensing something.

142
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:52,351
I'm tasting something.

143
00:06:55,453 --> 00:06:56,879
It tastes bad.

144
00:06:57,616 --> 00:07:01,693
- She's a bad cook!
- You sound just like my husband.

145
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:06,789
Mrs. Wagner?
Oh, please, excuse my partner.

146
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:10,016
His psychic visions are often
terribly impolite.

147
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,655
No need to apologize.

148
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,666
I really am a terrible cook.

149
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:17,200
I'm very sorry for your loss.

150
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:21,496
I'm sensing that you're at peace
with your husband's passing.

151
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:24,800
Well, not exactly at peace.

152
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:27,646
But it wasn't easy being married
to a food critic.

153
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,140
He graded everything I did.

154
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,438
Surely he couldn't have
graded everything.

155
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,071
I never broke two stars.

156
00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:40,446
Well, that's...

157
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:45,602
- Awfully harsh.
- So why did you keep on cooking for him?

158
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:49,211
Health reasons.
He had gotten a worrisome checkup

159
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:53,034
from his doctor recently,
he ate out every day

160
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:55,591
for his job, and always brought
the leftovers home, so

161
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:59,116
I started making him healthy,
home-cooked meals just once a week.

162
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:01,144
That's what dinner was tonight.

163
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:05,505
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Wagner.
You have our condolences.

164
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,700
She didn't kill him.

165
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,482
If she wanted him dead,
she wouldn't have cooked him

166
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:13,150
- healthy meals once a week.
- Great, let's just tell the police,

167
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:16,045
and get uncle Burton out of here
before they ask us anything else.

168
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:29,769
Check it out.

169
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:34,312
I went to candy emporium,
this time for research.

170
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:37,676
There are over 100 flavors
of lollipop on the market,

171
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,544
not one of which
turns your tongue black.

172
00:08:39,576 --> 00:08:41,864
- Can you believe that?
- What are you talking about?

173
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:44,681
Right before we left, I caught a quick
glimpse of the critic's mouth.

174
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:46,694
His tongue was coated black.

175
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,479
Now, what else could possibly
cause something like that?

176
00:08:50,088 --> 00:08:51,812
Bismuth subsalicylate.

177
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,547
That dude that used to play
for the mavericks?

178
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:57,155
No, Shawn, it's the active ingredient
in those pink stomach medications.

179
00:08:57,229 --> 00:09:00,633
He must've had some. Look, let's talk
about this later. My uncle is...

180
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:02,942
Gus. The critic was murdered.

181
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,362
I thought you said
the wife didn't kill him.

182
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:09,047
She didn't. He was complaining of
an upset stomach before dinner.

183
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,224
He asked for chicken soup.

184
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:12,346
That's the ultimate
"I'm feeling sick" meal.

185
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:15,047
Except, of course, for a tub of
bacon grease and hotdog water.

186
00:09:15,102 --> 00:09:17,721
- But usually...
- Shawn, this place is a sty.

187
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,225
Maybe you ought to tidy up
once in a while, huh?

188
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:22,269
Or did you forget
that you're the assistant?

189
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:25,462
You are absolutely right, sir.

190
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:28,898
The person who's not the psychic
detective should be in charge

191
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:30,848
all the cleaning. It just makes sense.

192
00:09:30,914 --> 00:09:34,930
Meanwhile, Gus here has new psychic
knowledge about yesterday's case.

193
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,134
- Yeah?
- No, I don't, Shawn.

194
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,756
I mean, I shouldn't spent
so much time working

195
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:42,468
- when I've got family in town.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous, Burton.

196
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:45,883
You think diagnosis murder ever let
family get in the way of his work?

197
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,938
Another excellent point.
I bet diagnosis murder never did that.

198
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:52,342
Go ahead, Gus, call up on the spirits.

199
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:54,458
Ask them what happened
to the dead critic.

200
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:55,901
Fine.

201
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:11,489
o/~ oh, spirits always willing o/~
o/~ to lend a helping hand o/~

202
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:14,518
This psychic stuff can get
a little wimpy, huh?

203
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:17,324
At least he's not doing it
in the tutu and capezios.

204
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:22,503
I asked you to help me solve
the murder of Vince Wagner.

205
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,952
Show me what transpired.

206
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:30,902
I'm seeing something.

207
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:35,900
I'm seeing...

208
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm seeing...

209
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:41,770
I don't know what I'm seeing.

210
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:43,032
Wait, wait.

211
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:45,202
It's coming clearer now.

212
00:10:46,298 --> 00:10:49,558
Somebody put something in his food...

213
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:52,185
At a restaurant.

214
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:57,177
And that is what made him sick.

215
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:01,945
Sick to the point of having a seizure.

216
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:04,381
No, no, no.

217
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:12,227
That's what killed...
That's what killed his nose.

218
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,354
What?

219
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,935
- That's what killed him.
- Whoo, Gus!

220
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,531
You are so amazing with that stuff.

221
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,338
If it wasn't for his psychic talents,
I'd have to get some lame job

222
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,057
at a pharmaceutical company
or something.

223
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:29,156
That happens to be a very
exciting industry, Shawn.

224
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,018
Now let's go and tell the police
our new revelation.

225
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,165
Uncle Burton, wait here.

226
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:36,757
No way. If I wanted to sit alone in a dirty
room, I'd have stayed at home with my wife.

227
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:38,216
I'm going with you guys.

228
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:44,100
Killed his nose?!
You went like this.

229
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:45,841
How do you kill a nose?!

230
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,895
Shawn, that visitor's badge is
not gonna hold him up for long.

231
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:54,599
I can't be psychic
in front of the cops.

232
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,004
Don't worry, I have a plan.

233
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,691
I'm gonna go in Vick's office,
you wait here.

234
00:11:57,724 --> 00:11:59,300
- For what?
- My signal.

235
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,686
The stuff you did in the office,
genius, all of it.

236
00:12:01,741 --> 00:12:04,277
But I wanted you to say
"poison," Gus. Poison.

237
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,760
- Get it right this time.
- This time?

238
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:08,081
Shawn, what are you about to...
There's no time to explain!

239
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,504
Ham pencils!

240
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,985
Sheila e. Tomato bark!
Velvety shark toast...

241
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:15,686
Shark toast!

242
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:18,304
Is there something wrong
with you, Mr. Spencer?

243
00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:20,398
You picked today
to ask him that question?

244
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:22,613
Dude, Lassie,
what happened to your arm?

245
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:24,883
- I don't want to talk about it.
- He won't tell us either.

246
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:26,375
And what were you saying
when you came in?

247
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:28,500
- I couldn't understand any of it.
- Oh, Jules, it's this case.

248
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:30,574
These visions I'm having,
they're so intense,

249
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,188
I can't even describe them.

250
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:35,016
Every time I open my mouth,
the wrong fishes come out!

251
00:12:35,072 --> 00:12:38,310
- You mean "words"?
- Isn't that what I said? Oh, no.

252
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:40,243
If only there were someone here
that could translate.

253
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:42,917
You know, someone who's known me so
long they understand everything I say.

254
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:46,066
Someone just slightly
less handsome than I am.

255
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:49,365
Gus! Perfect... This is perfect.

256
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:51,652
- Gus, Gus, get in here.
- What?

257
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:55,325
Oh, mambo beef puddles!
Swirly-whirly jungle pants!

258
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:58,220
Quick, translate that
into normal words for us.

259
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:01,943
Man, they made me fill this thing out
for six pages of paper work,

260
00:13:01,976 --> 00:13:03,199
and they didn't put
my picture on it.

261
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,670
- Sorry, who are you?
- Don't ask anymore questions.

262
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,180
No one. Concentrate, Gus.
Tell us that all this means.

263
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:14,303
Swirly-whirly jungle pants.

264
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,811
It means the critic ate something
he wasn't supposed to.

265
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:22,343
- Two bones and a skull.
- Two bones and a sku... poison.

266
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:25,161
Yes, the critic was poisoned.

267
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:27,724
Man, this is better
than "Ghost Whisperers".

268
00:13:27,771 --> 00:13:30,699
Guys, we checked the wife's soup.
It's clean.

269
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,010
And am I now supposed
to believe that Guster here...

270
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:35,032
- Carnival stud muffin... Huh?
- What?

271
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:39,142
It wasn't the wife. The critic
was poisoned at a restaurant.

272
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:41,601
Now, that makes sense.

273
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:43,847
Wagner was pretty harsh
on his own wife's cooking.

274
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,239
He was probably even harder
on the restaurants he reviewed.

275
00:13:46,295 --> 00:13:49,168
He could have easily been poisoned by
a chef who got a bad review.

276
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:52,587
- Do you think so?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

277
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,252
Okay...

278
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,198
Call the lab.
I want a tox report on my desk asap.

279
00:13:58,319 --> 00:13:59,402
You're actually listening to this?

280
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:02,424
Well, we've gotten information
in stranger ways before.

281
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:04,176
Never hurts to check it out.

282
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:08,368
Burton, that was fantastic.
How do you do that stuff?

283
00:14:08,424 --> 00:14:10,427
He can't talk tight now,
uncle Burton.

284
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,167
Psychic episodes like that
leave him very, very parched.

285
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:15,489
No, no, no, let me
get you some water.

286
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:16,882
Down those stairs,
around the corner.

287
00:14:16,915 --> 00:14:19,600
Thank you.
What do we do now?

288
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:21,582
We've gotta figure out
what that critic ate.

289
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:23,626
If he was poisoned by a chef,
it had to have been something

290
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,626
he consumed in the 24 hours
leading up to his death.

291
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,814
- How do we do that?
- Well, Wagner's wife said,

292
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:29,223
he brought all of his
left overs home, right?

293
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:31,717
The refrigerator was packed
with take-out containers.

294
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,590
The one on top was probably
the most recent.

295
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:38,082
The restaurant it came from was...

296
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:45,280
- The curvy a.
- "The curvy a"?

297
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:47,324
That doesn't sound like
a place that serves food, Shawn.

298
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:49,324
It's not the name, it's
the symbol on top of the box.

299
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:50,777
Come on, man, you eat out
all the time.

300
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,771
What place has a big,
swoopy, curving a?

301
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:54,759
I don't know.
What does it look like?

302
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,179
- Antonio's.
- Sweet!

303
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:06,930
- Why did you write on my hand?!
- Why would I write on my own hand?

304
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:09,857
- This thing is totally permanent.
- Wha... Shawn!

305
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:14,663
Let's make this quick before
uncle Burton starts thinking

306
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:15,657
of sticking 'em with the check.

307
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,817
Fire up the entrees
for the eight-top.

308
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,792
Mario, where are my starters?
Hurry up!

309
00:15:21,614 --> 00:15:22,951
Hey, chef Antonio.

310
00:15:22,995 --> 00:15:24,332
We'd like to ask you
a couple questions.

311
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:27,625
Sorry, guys, no customers
allowed in the kitchen, okay?

312
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:28,708
No, we're not customers.

313
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,552
We're from the health department,
here for a surprise inspection.

314
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:36,058
Again? We just had the surprise
inspection a few days ago.

315
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,735
- Why, is there a problem?
- Yes.

316
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:40,619
- You weren't surprised enough.
- Let's make this quick.

317
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:46,500
Walls and the floor are clean.
Drainage is clear.

318
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:50,741
Hand washing station is stocked
with soap and clean towels.

319
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,338
Dry food storage over there,
walk-in freezer over here.

320
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:01,077
Looks good.

321
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:04,273
Aren't you supposed to check
the temperature?

322
00:16:04,322 --> 00:16:07,079
Of course. Gus, go ahead,
check the temperature.

323
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:10,648
- Me? Why do I have to do it?
- Dude, I'm wearing short sleeves.

324
00:16:13,617 --> 00:16:16,169
So did you hear what happened to
the food critic down at the mirror?

325
00:16:16,202 --> 00:16:20,162
- That's some nasty business, huh?
- Sure, I heard about Wagner.

326
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:21,631
I don't say I'm sad.

327
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:24,836
Ten years I've been working in this
town, that man never gave my food

328
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:26,206
a good review.

329
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,675
Sounds like you're not
very fond of the guy.

330
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:34,213
Vince Wagner made my life miserable
with his asinine reviews.

331
00:16:34,274 --> 00:16:38,197
Honestly, I am glad that
that bastard is dead!

332
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:39,545
Chef Antonio!

333
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:43,856
You're under arrest
for the murder of Vince Wagner.

334
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:46,504
- Take him.
- Murder?

335
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,985
Is this a joke? I...

336
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:51,779
- Who put you up to this?
- Jules, what's going on here?

337
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,657
Tox screen came back positive.

338
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:56,491
Apparently Wagner ate a poisonous
mushroom called the "death cap."

339
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:57,242
What are you saying?

340
00:16:57,286 --> 00:16:59,065
There were death caps
in the mushroom risotto

341
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,921
Wagner ate here
the day before he died.

342
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,048
We found the leftovers
in his fridge.

343
00:17:03,236 --> 00:17:05,999
Looks like
you were right, Shawn... Or Gus.

344
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:09,059
Or... Whoever.

345
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:13,210
What a relief. We caught the guy,
we solved the case,

346
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:15,983
and best of all, I don't have
to be psychic anymore.

347
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:24,700
What?

348
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,114
We got the wrong guy.

349
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,675
Guys, it's not
that complicated.

350
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,404
Whenever a critic eats
at his restaurant,

351
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:42,652
- Antonio prepares the meal himself.
- Not this time.

352
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:45,155
The mushrooms in the take-out container
we cut into cubes.

353
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:47,155
Antonio cuts his mushrooms
into strips.

354
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:49,928
Lassie, I have a really
strong vibe he didn't do this.

355
00:17:49,972 --> 00:17:52,028
Look, we know Antonio
hated Wagner.

356
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,004
Wagner died from eating his risotto.
We have the risotto.

357
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:57,672
We even have Wagner's notes
proving he ate the risotto.

358
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,024
It's a slam dunk.

359
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:08,378
That's Wagner's notebook.
It says the risotto was cold.

360
00:18:08,397 --> 00:18:09,634
- So?
- So...

361
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:14,024
Whoa... The sandpaper
with the bana patch!

362
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:16,508
I think he means
the risotto was cold.

363
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,098
- Thank you, Gus.
- You're welcome.

364
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:20,938
Why would food be served cold at a
five-star restaurant, unless...

365
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:24,032
Unless the poisoned food was
cooked somewhere else?

366
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,306
You know what I think?

367
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,012
Case is closed.

368
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:34,751
Hey, guys. I want to thank you for
an incredible day, Burton.

369
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,164
You're a regular rockford files.

370
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,505
Did my uncle just thank me
for an incredible day?

371
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:46,024
A more important question,
how much tv does he watch?

372
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:47,350
I'm serious, Shawn.

373
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,701
My cousin took him to the super
bowl on a helicopter,

374
00:18:49,756 --> 00:18:50,982
and he never even
thanked him for that.

375
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:56,114
I'm serious too. He's like this crazy,
tank-shaped encyclopedia of detective shows.

376
00:18:56,579 --> 00:18:58,037
I be he even saw manimal.

377
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,238
- You're right.
- About manimal?

378
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,294
Shawn, we have to solve this
case before he leaves.

379
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:04,186
- Why?
- Because, I think I've finally

380
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:05,876
figured out how to get back
on his good side.

381
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:08,113
I've been seeking uncle Burton's
approval all my life.

382
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:09,560
He's mean to everybody.

383
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:11,455
But ever since he started
tagging along on this case,

384
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:13,571
he's been kind of nice to me.
You know why?

385
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:14,631
You don't have the braids anymore.

386
00:19:14,664 --> 00:19:17,416
He likes detective shows
if I could solve this case

387
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:20,278
before he leaves, he may finally get over
the whole "Gus Burton" thing.

388
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:23,603
- But I'm gonna need your help.
- All right, fine, Mr. Psychic detective.

389
00:19:23,636 --> 00:19:27,636
Tell me, since Antonio clearly
didn't kill the critic, who did?

390
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:29,114
I don't know.

391
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:31,994
Maybe we should find out
if anyone else hated him.

392
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:35,010
- See who else may have had a motive.
- What?

393
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:38,109
You're gonna start a crime-fighting
revolution with talk like that.

394
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:42,645
Shawn, you say stuff like that
all the time!

395
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:51,149
Phil Pritikin,
Mr. Editor-in-chief.

396
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:52,387
Shawn Spencer...

397
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,530
Long-time reader,
first-time caller...

398
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:57,165
What's going on with
the sunday spread?

399
00:19:57,232 --> 00:19:59,077
Layout's waiting for your
approval on the mock-up.

400
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,529
"Mock-up," funny word.
Like I was saying...

401
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:04,049
- Where' Salazar's Alderman story?
- She's typing it up.

402
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:07,083
- Do you want copy to read it first?
- No, just send it straight here.

403
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,254
Anything else?

404
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,862
You know, Phil, now that you mention it,
I would very much like...

405
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:13,369
- Does he work here?
- I don't believe so, sir.

406
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:14,784
Son, I'm a busy man.

407
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:16,413
If you don't work for me,
I don't have the time.

408
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:18,561
I just have a question
about Vince Wagner.

409
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:19,932
Cooper, these guys got questions.

410
00:20:21,632 --> 00:20:24,577
Oh, I also have an idea
for a crossover strip,

411
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,284
where Dilbert finally
meets marmaduke.

412
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:29,125
Did you guys need something?

413
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:33,686
Hi, I'm Burton Guster,
with the sbpd.

414
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,946
We're investigating
the murder of Vince Wagner.

415
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,290
I'm Cooper. I was
Mr. Wagner's assistant.

416
00:20:38,323 --> 00:20:40,665
Great. Maybe you could help us out.

417
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:43,600
Do you know of anyone who may have
had a grudge against your boss?

418
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:45,108
Are you serious?

419
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:50,031
We call them the angry chef letters.
Every chef who ever got a bad review

420
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:52,351
would write a nasty letter
to Mr. Wagner about it.

421
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:54,446
So you're saying
this is all hate mail?

422
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:56,456
I don't know
if I'd call it all hate mail.

423
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,706
It ranges from
"mild dislike" mail

424
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:04,066
- to "extreme abhorrence" mail.
- How about "I wish you were dead" mail?

425
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:07,087
Oh, we have those too. Back here.

426
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,578
Any one of these chefs could
have cooked the poison risotto

427
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:12,204
and snuck it into
Antonio's restaurant.

428
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:15,920
You're right. We should talk to all these
chefs before they open for business.

429
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,482
Call the restaurants
and make a reservation.

430
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,246
- For justice.
- Is justice the time

431
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:22,493
- or the number of people in our party?
- Just call 'em.

432
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:24,474
And make it for three.
Uncle Burton's coming.

433
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:25,657
All right.

434
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,128
So what did you think of Vince Wagner?

435
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,751
Looky here, he was a jackass.

436
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,731
You know what he called
my award-winning jambalaya?

437
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:39,882
"Jumba-lousy!"

438
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,624
Now tell me if this ain't the best damn
jambalaya you've never had in your life.

439
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:54,352
You know what he wrote in his review
of my famous miso yellow tail roll?

440
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:56,168
"Miso disappointed."

441
00:21:57,828 --> 00:21:59,746
Don't laugh.
It's not funny.

442
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:00,776
No, it's not.

443
00:22:01,452 --> 00:22:02,620
Let's put it this way.

444
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,160
He once referred to
my white chocolate tiramisu

445
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:08,197
- as "ass cake".
- Oh, now that just seems mean.

446
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:12,164
I didn't kill him.
I was here that night cookin'.

447
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,639
Had a bunch of big groups.
Never even left the kitchen.

448
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,778
I was either in the kitchen or
out here talking to customers.

449
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:23,305
I own this place.
I have to watch over everything.

450
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:26,086
Every bowl, every noodle,
every chopstick...

451
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:29,086
I didn't kill him. I definitely
thought about it a couple of times.

452
00:22:29,087 --> 00:22:31,672
I could never figure out
why that guy was so angry.

453
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:34,164
He ate out at fancy restaurants
all the time for free,

454
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:35,745
and still, all he did was complain.

455
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:39,650
Ask her some more questions.
Maybe she'll give us some cookies.

456
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:44,285
I'm confused...
Why are you here?

457
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:46,523
Wagner never even
reviewed my restaurant.

458
00:22:47,597 --> 00:22:49,442
Oh, make it right.
There it is.

459
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:56,195
That was, without question, the tastiest
dead-end we have ever gone down.

460
00:22:56,283 --> 00:22:59,111
Well, at least it wasn't
a complete waste of our time.

461
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:02,420
It seems to me like any of these chefs
were way to busy to murder the critic.

462
00:23:02,457 --> 00:23:04,449
Matlock never ate this good.

463
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,129
I'm going back to the car
an unbutton my pants.

464
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:13,280
You know... I've been thinking about
what that dessert chef said.

465
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:15,162
Wagner got to eat out at
fancy restaurants

466
00:23:15,163 --> 00:23:18,575
every day on the newspaper's dime.
If I was him, I'd be happy.

467
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:20,825
I mean, who wouldn't want
to have that job?

468
00:23:21,207 --> 00:23:22,350
That's a good point.

469
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:24,539
That's a really good point, Gus.

470
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,653
I think you're right...
We were wrong about the chefs.

471
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:29,170
Maybe this wasn't about revenge at all.
Maybe this was about...

472
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:30,879
Somebody wanting
the restaurant critic's job.

473
00:23:30,904 --> 00:23:32,965
- Someone who works at the newspaper.
- Exactly.

474
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:34,470
We need to get down there
and talk to the editor.

475
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:36,609
Wait, wait, Shawn,
he's not gonna talk to us.

476
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,467
He doesn't talk to anybody
who doesn't work for him.

477
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:40,176
I don't think that will
be a problem.

478
00:23:56,988 --> 00:23:58,598
Okay, I think
I have something here.

479
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:01,254
You, sir, are left-handed.

480
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:03,564
You have a new baby at home,

481
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:07,168
you just covered a story
somewhere in the midwest,

482
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:11,094
and you... You just really,
really need to pee.

483
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,769
Just go.

484
00:24:16,243 --> 00:24:17,842
All right, you convinced me.

485
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:21,149
Congratulations, you're our
new astrological forecaster.

486
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,850
Now get out of here, you've got a job
to do, you've got a deadline to meet.

487
00:24:29,573 --> 00:24:33,163
- Hey, dude. Did you read my horoscopes?
- Yes. They're terrible.

488
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:35,079
Horoscopes are supposed to be vague,

489
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,525
so that people can interpret them
to mean whatever they want.

490
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:39,222
Yours are all way too specific.

491
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:41,214
I wrote them with
specific people in mind.

492
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:45,741
"Aries: calcium is especially
important to you right now,

493
00:24:45,742 --> 00:24:48,897
Mr. Salt & Pepper hair
with a maroon car."

494
00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:51,443
"There may also be a promotion
in your future."

495
00:24:51,444 --> 00:24:54,879
"Try walking backwards
through doorways for good luck."

496
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,977
- Carlton, are you expecting a promotion?
- No.

497
00:24:58,075 --> 00:25:00,633
Come on, O'hara, don't be so naive.
It's a horoscope...

498
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:03,326
- It's nonsense.
- Detective Lassiter, may I have a word?

499
00:25:04,248 --> 00:25:05,256
Of course.

500
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:12,816
Let's see, what's mine?

501
00:25:13,258 --> 00:25:17,433
Libra: Your one true love
will be wearing sneakers

502
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:19,738
and an apple jacks tee shirt.

503
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,746
That's kind of a weird detail.

504
00:25:21,972 --> 00:25:23,226
Phil! Hiya...

505
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:26,065
Wondering if I could ask you
a couple questions about this

506
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,725
restaurant critic job.

507
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:30,547
- Great, you too.
- I'm sorry?

508
00:25:30,606 --> 00:25:33,657
Everybody, from the ombudsman
to the delivery boy

509
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:35,773
wants to be the new restaurant critic.

510
00:25:35,774 --> 00:25:37,949
I know it's the cushiest gig
in all of journalism,

511
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,567
but I hired you to write horoscopes,
and that's what I expect you to do.

512
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:44,224
Whoa, Phil, I think
you're getting the wrong idea.

513
00:25:44,225 --> 00:25:47,168
I just could sense
that you're totally swamped.

514
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:50,864
I figured I'd come on in,
offer up my sooth sayer services...

515
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:53,065
Sayer services?

516
00:25:53,102 --> 00:25:56,459
- Sooth services.
- Sooth services...

517
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,339
To help you pick
the best candidate for the job.

518
00:25:58,388 --> 00:26:00,242
I guess you are pretty sharp.

519
00:26:00,243 --> 00:26:03,363
Applications are over there.
Keep it quiet though.

520
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:05,134
Every single person who works here

521
00:26:05,135 --> 00:26:07,974
is playing some sort of angle.
To get the restaurant critic job.

522
00:26:08,003 --> 00:26:09,626
Sir, meeting in five.

523
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:13,928
You know, these cheetos are
so crispy, yet airy.

524
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:16,206
And its subtle flavor is such a

525
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,555
wonderful contrast to
its eye-catching color.

526
00:26:18,596 --> 00:26:19,604
I get it!

527
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:22,948
Every day with the cheetos.

528
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:25,497
Shawn...

529
00:26:25,498 --> 00:26:27,286
There is 100 applications in here.

530
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:30,108
That's 100 suspects.
My uncle's flight leaves today.

531
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:31,940
We don't have time to talk
to 100 people, Shawn.

532
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,676
We don't need to.
We just need to talk to the one guy

533
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,803
that can link one of those people
to the murder weapon.

534
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:37,849
And who's that?

535
00:26:47,654 --> 00:26:48,859
Delicious.

536
00:26:49,486 --> 00:26:51,268
Are you sure about this guy?

537
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:55,845
He's the only mushroom farmer
in the tri-county area.

538
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:57,874
If anyone can help us, he can.

539
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:03,251
Mr. Mooney, thanks again for
taking the time to speak with us.

540
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:08,741
So, how many types of mushrooms
do you grow here?

541
00:27:08,993 --> 00:27:10,826
A couple of hundred,
depending on the season.

542
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:13,100
Does that include a mushroom
called the "death cap"?

543
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:16,408
The death cap? Heck no, man,
those things are poisonous.

544
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:17,866
Besides, they only grow in the wild.

545
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:21,813
Well, let's say we were looking
for the death cap around here.

546
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:25,353
- Where would we find it?
- Well, I know a few places in the hills.

547
00:27:26,173 --> 00:27:27,218
Why do you ask?

548
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,062
Why do you ask
why do I ask?

549
00:27:30,476 --> 00:27:32,689
Why do you ask why do I ask
why do you ask?

550
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:33,765
Why do you ask why do I ask

551
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:35,265
- why do you ask why do...
- Shawn!

552
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:37,538
I'm... I'm just curious.

553
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:39,518
Yeah, well, a guy came in here
a couple of weeks ago,

554
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,362
and he had
the exact same question.

555
00:27:41,408 --> 00:27:42,933
Do you remember this person's name?

556
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,542
Can't say that I do, but I remember
exactly what he looked like.

557
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:49,713
- Can you give us a description?
- Yeah, okay, man.

558
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:52,060
The guy was about
nine-feet tall, right.

559
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:55,789
He had sunshine coming out of his mouth,
and he had a hippotamus for a hand.

560
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:59,030
- I don't think I have any more questions.
- Yep, that'll do it.

561
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:02,713
Okay, uncle Burton, just let me know
when you're all packed up,

562
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,000
and I'll pick you up and take you
to the airport. All right.

563
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:07,529
We spent two hours riding up
to that mushroom farm,

564
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,189
and we're right back
to when we started.

565
00:28:10,437 --> 00:28:13,107
Don't be such a gloomy you, Gus.
Look at the bright side.

566
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,526
- Now we know the killer is a he.
- And that he has a hippopotamus for a hand?

567
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:17,754
That helps us out a lot.

568
00:28:18,354 --> 00:28:21,235
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- "Sagittarius :

569
00:28:21,236 --> 00:28:24,972
Please return the bb gun you confiscated
from your son in the second grade."

570
00:28:24,973 --> 00:28:27,173
P.S., you are a cranky-pants."

571
00:28:27,228 --> 00:28:28,383
That's an amazing coincidence.

572
00:28:28,384 --> 00:28:30,670
Didn't you confiscate a bb gun
from me in the second grade?

573
00:28:30,712 --> 00:28:32,421
Look, Shawn, here's your stuff.

574
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:36,376
Next time you want something from me,
be an adult and ask for it.

575
00:28:36,377 --> 00:28:39,036
Passing yourself off as a psychic,
that's bad enough.

576
00:28:39,037 --> 00:28:40,671
But horoscopes...
Shawn, Shawn!

577
00:28:40,838 --> 00:28:43,088
What if some idiot out there
reads this crap

578
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,285
- and decides to take it seriously?
- Dad,

579
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:47,437
it clearly states that
astrological forecasts

580
00:28:47,438 --> 00:28:49,808
are for entertainment
purposes only.

581
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:51,628
Besides, I only took the job for a case.

582
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:53,797
We're investigating
the restaurant critic murder.

583
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,810
The cops already have a suspect,
but we're pretty sure that chef Antonio

584
00:28:56,811 --> 00:29:00,365
- was framed.
- Then I assume you know all about the

585
00:29:00,366 --> 00:29:02,681
veggie burger incident.

586
00:29:03,044 --> 00:29:05,269
Of course we know about
the veggie burger incident, dad.

587
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,001
We're professional detectives.

588
00:29:07,415 --> 00:29:09,063
- Gus...
- Googling it.

589
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:11,964
Shawn, you know, maybe
instead of wasting your time

590
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:15,678
writing this garbage for the newspaper,
you might try reading it once in a while.

591
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,946
A couple of months ago, vegetarian
customers at Antonio's restaurant

592
00:29:18,947 --> 00:29:21,873
started complaing about how bland
the vegetarian burgers were.

593
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:25,171
In my personal opinion, you eat
a burger without beef in it,

594
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:27,764
you've lost the right
to complain about flavor.

595
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:30,604
I've heard that speech before. Just call
someone a hippie and get to the point.

596
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,507
The point is Antonio decided
to make the burgers tastier

597
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:35,455
by adding beef broth to the recipe.

598
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:39,354
Oh, great, all the complaints stopped,
till some crazed vegan lady...

599
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,653
- By the name of "dwyer."
- ... Found out about it,

600
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,814
and started organizing boycotts
against Antonio's restaurant.

601
00:29:45,256 --> 00:29:46,609
They've been feuding ever since.

602
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:49,092
This guy secretly fed beef
to vegetarians?

603
00:29:49,093 --> 00:29:50,406
Why are we trying
to get him out of jail?

604
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:53,812
Because he didn't kill the critic.
Take a look at this article, Shawn.

605
00:29:53,813 --> 00:29:56,494
She advocates any action to put
chef Antonio out of business

606
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:57,883
for the veggie burger incident.

607
00:29:58,304 --> 00:30:00,296
She calls herself the "vegan vigilante".

608
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:02,143
How very villainous of her.

609
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:05,266
You think she could've framed Antonio
for Wagner's death or what?

610
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:06,901
Only one way to find out.

611
00:30:07,024 --> 00:30:08,659
Do you know where
this dwyer lady might be?

612
00:30:08,696 --> 00:30:11,782
Sure, I saw her at the drive-thru
a couple of days ago.

613
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:13,218
That's very helpful, dad.

614
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:15,087
What makes you think
she'll be there today?

615
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:18,102
Meat is murder!

616
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:20,409
Stop eating your fellow creatures!

617
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:23,239
All animals have got
the right to live!

618
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,108
Meat is murder!

619
00:30:25,145 --> 00:30:26,536
I hate it when my dad's right.

620
00:30:26,683 --> 00:30:28,772
Stop eating your fellow creatures!

621
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:31,540
All animals have got the right to live.

622
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:34,221
Yo, vegan vigilante lady.

623
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,807
- How long have you been out here?
- Three days.

624
00:30:36,841 --> 00:30:40,004
We heard that you had
a grudge with chef Antonio.

625
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,550
- Were you near his restaurant recently?
- Yeah,

626
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:45,030
I led a protest outside of
his place on Tuesday night.

627
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:46,297
Tuesday night?

628
00:30:47,482 --> 00:30:48,490
Excuse us.

629
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:52,056
That was the same night
the critic was poisoned.

630
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,121
Dude, I think we just found our killer.

631
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:57,697
Detective Lassiter, SBPD!

632
00:30:57,698 --> 00:31:01,121
- Who's in charge of this freak fest?
- Guys, we got your message.

633
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:04,040
Will you please tell us
what this has to do with the...

634
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:05,048
Case?

635
00:31:06,351 --> 00:31:08,305
- Nice shirt.
- Thanks.

636
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,949
Did you buy that today
by any chance?

637
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:13,444
This old rag?
Nah.

638
00:31:13,445 --> 00:31:15,622
I've had this thing
for just about forever.

639
00:31:15,892 --> 00:31:19,027
Remember when I sent off
those cereal box tops to get this thing?

640
00:31:19,195 --> 00:31:20,314
You didn't do that.

641
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:21,641
- Sure I did.
- No, you didn't.

642
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:23,208
It was the same year you got
your first cabbage patch...

643
00:31:23,242 --> 00:31:24,251
Shut up.

644
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:26,092
- I remember.
- Why do you ask, Jules?

645
00:31:26,786 --> 00:31:29,384
All right, this wack job is in violation
of at least six different

646
00:31:29,385 --> 00:31:31,555
municipal codes, and
she smells like curly fries.

647
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:34,760
I say we cut her loose, take her down.
Where's the restaurant manager?

648
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:36,825
He's probably inside
managing the restaurant.

649
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:37,904
Copy that.

650
00:31:40,741 --> 00:31:44,036
Wait for it.
Wait for it...

651
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:47,893
- Is there a problem?
- No, no, I'm just...

652
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:50,069
Making sure I'm not being followed.

653
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:53,137
Good cop... Always aware
of his surroundings.

654
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:00,045
I better go help him.

655
00:32:02,197 --> 00:32:03,205
Uncle Burton.

656
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:06,438
Burton, I got here
as soon as I could.

657
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:08,542
Who are all these strange people?

658
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:11,395
It's all a part of our investigation.
We had to come check out a lead.

659
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,574
- Thanks for meeting me down here.
- Oh, no problem.

660
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:15,916
That ride in the cab gave me
a chance to fill out this postcard

661
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:19,538
letting everybody in the family know
about our psychic detective.

662
00:32:20,473 --> 00:32:22,993
Well, I hope you saved
some room on there...

663
00:32:22,994 --> 00:32:25,441
- 'Cause I just solved the case.
- Yeah?

664
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:29,983
A few months ago, chef Antonio
put beef broth in his veggie burgers

665
00:32:29,984 --> 00:32:34,579
at his restaurant, infuriating
vegetarians all over Santa Barbara.

666
00:32:34,837 --> 00:32:38,292
That woman tried to
put the chef out of business.

667
00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:39,548
But it didn't work.

668
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:44,424
So instead, she poisoned the critic,
and framed chef Antonio for it.

669
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:47,179
What are you talking about?
I never poisoned anybody.

670
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,189
You guys are nuts.

671
00:32:48,226 --> 00:32:52,323
Hey, watch the way you talk to my nephew,
'cause he can see right into your soul.

672
00:32:52,506 --> 00:32:54,196
You were there
on the night it happened,

673
00:32:54,197 --> 00:32:58,093
and I'm sure that seeing the chef behind
bars must make you pretty happy.

674
00:32:58,126 --> 00:33:00,622
Well, of course
it makes me happy.

675
00:33:00,623 --> 00:33:03,233
He didn't have respect
for the rights of animals.

676
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:07,686
- Meat is murder.
- But murder is also murder, Miss Dwyer!

677
00:33:07,713 --> 00:33:08,717
We'll be right there.

678
00:33:08,976 --> 00:33:11,004
Guys, there's been
a development in your case.

679
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:14,795
Someone died from eating death caps,
that were discarded downtown yesterday.

680
00:33:14,824 --> 00:33:16,545
- Yesterday?
- Yesterday?

681
00:33:16,643 --> 00:33:19,261
Dude, it couldn't be her. She's been
chained to a pole for three days.

682
00:33:19,262 --> 00:33:20,786
Plus, we're now here near downtown.

683
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:21,831
She still could've done it.

684
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:23,166
She could have easily
have slipped out of here

685
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,274
- and done it when no one was around.
- Actually, she couldn't have.

686
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:29,509
We have a rough description of the
suspect that threw the mushrooms away.

687
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,347
It was a six-foot tall man.

688
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:39,773
Psychic... Bogus.

689
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:44,287
Our second victim was a homeless man.

690
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:47,884
Ate a bag of death caps he saw
being tossed in a dumpster yesterday,

691
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:51,444
then went to the health clinic today
after complaing of abdominal pains.

692
00:33:51,668 --> 00:33:53,021
He died a few hours ago.

693
00:33:53,043 --> 00:33:55,219
What else do we know about the
person who discarded them?

694
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:59,703
Not much. The victim died before he was
able to give us an accurate description.

695
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,199
And chef Antonio was in custody,
so it looks like he's innocent.

696
00:34:03,964 --> 00:34:06,427
Not if he had an accomplice.
Now that we've got the chef,

697
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:08,410
his partner's out there
trying to dispose of evidence.

698
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:10,388
Let's go down to lockup,
talk to that chef.

699
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,197
Thanks.

700
00:34:13,894 --> 00:34:14,988
See you later.

701
00:34:17,378 --> 00:34:20,538
- Where was the dumpster located?
- At the corner of Laguna and Vista.

702
00:34:22,549 --> 00:34:24,578
Shawn, we were on
the right track.

703
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:27,034
Laguna and Vista is across
the street from the newspaper.

704
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:29,205
Whoever threw out those mushrooms
works at the paper.

705
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:30,709
We have to go back
over there.

706
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,471
- Uncle Burton's flight leaves in an hour.
- I don't care.

707
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:36,526
Do you know what's at stake here, Shawn?
My entire future with my family.

708
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,267
Yeah, that, two unsolved murders,
and an innocent man who's still in jail.

709
00:34:39,268 --> 00:34:40,780
But your family too.

710
00:34:40,781 --> 00:34:42,665
Dude, we still have no idea
who the killer is.

711
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:44,915
And it's gonna take longer
than an hour to figure that out.

712
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:49,302
Fine, let's go
to the stupid airport.

713
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,500
Listen, Burton,

714
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:56,357
maybe you're not all to blame
for fouling up this case.

715
00:34:56,358 --> 00:35:00,329
I mean... I can't help but think that
you'd do better at this detective business

716
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,471
if you didn't have Shawn
weighing you down.

717
00:35:02,472 --> 00:35:05,165
I mean, I don't see what
he's bringing to the operation.

718
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,760
You're psychic, he's not.

719
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:09,600
- What do you need him around for?
- You know,

720
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:11,162
Gus, your uncle has a point.

721
00:35:11,182 --> 00:35:14,464
What I'm trying to say is it was murder,
she wrote, not murder, they wrote.

722
00:35:14,554 --> 00:35:17,183
- That's true.
- Oh, this is great.

723
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:19,433
I left some of my clothes at the hotel.

724
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:22,033
Maybe if somebody hadn't
rushed me down to the burger stand,

725
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:24,997
I wouldn't have forgotten to pack
my new yellow hippo shirt.

726
00:35:25,031 --> 00:35:27,696
- You mean your hip shirts?
- No, I mean my hippo shirt.

727
00:35:27,697 --> 00:35:30,081
I bought a couple of 'em
down on state street.

728
00:35:30,082 --> 00:35:34,218
You know, normally I don't go for
modern fashion, but these hippo shirts,

729
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:36,069
they make my arms look so huge.

730
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:40,311
They've got a nice little hippo logo
right on the sleeve... See?

731
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,413
Nice.

732
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:45,775
He had sunshine
coming out of his mouth.

733
00:35:46,898 --> 00:35:48,853
He had a hippotamus
for a hand.

734
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,877
Gus, I just figured it out.

735
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:56,316
Who had the best access to the person
picking the next restaurant critic?

736
00:35:56,317 --> 00:35:57,328
Think about it.

737
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:01,375
Uncle Burton, you might be
a little late for your flight.

738
00:36:06,617 --> 00:36:10,761
So I'm proud to announce that our
new restaurant critic will be...

739
00:36:10,762 --> 00:36:13,222
My hard-working assistant Nick.

740
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:17,004
Thank you so much, sir.

741
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:20,508
I am so surprised. I honestly
didn't expect to get this job at all.

742
00:36:20,547 --> 00:36:22,400
That's not exactly true, is it?!

743
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:23,985
- Whoa, Gus...
- Don't worry, I got it.

744
00:36:23,986 --> 00:36:26,526
You knew that Phil Pritikin
would give you this job.

745
00:36:26,527 --> 00:36:29,169
That's why you murdered Vince Wagner.

746
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,162
- Wait...
- I said I got it.

747
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,207
Hang on, hang on.

748
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,175
- You're saying he's the killer?
- Yes.

749
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:37,113
And I'm going to tell you
exactly how he did it...

750
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:38,728
In just a second.

751
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:41,250
You never told me
how he did it.

752
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:43,257
- Why do you think I'm trying to stop you?
- What are we gonna do?

753
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:45,590
My uncle thinks I'm the psychic,
the newspaper thinks you're a psychic,

754
00:36:45,591 --> 00:36:47,655
and the cops think I'm just
translating your visions.

755
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,800
- Give me a second to think.
- Hurry up.

756
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:50,833
Okay, I have a plan.

757
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,555
Blurt out something
nonsensical... Do it now.

758
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:54,108
Keylaces, shoeboards, pineapples!

759
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:57,332
Oh, no. The visions have become
too complex for one person to decipher.

760
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:59,850
- Gus, might I offer my help?
- Yes, Shawn, you...

761
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:00,994
Magic head.

762
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:04,077
Two heads working together as one.

763
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,462
You!

764
00:37:06,463 --> 00:37:08,478
You wanted the most coveted job
the paper had to offer,

765
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,641
and you were in the good graces of
the one guy that could give it to you,

766
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:11,994
but there was a problem.
Now...

767
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:13,935
What was that problem?

768
00:37:15,178 --> 00:37:17,635
The problem was Wagner
was never going to retire.

769
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:19,098
So what did you do?

770
00:37:20,547 --> 00:37:23,346
You hatched a plan
to force Wagner off the job.

771
00:37:23,347 --> 00:37:25,473
The first thing you need was a fall guy.

772
00:37:25,474 --> 00:37:27,375
Unfortunately, Lee Majors
wasn't available.

773
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:33,292
Apparently, he was available.
He lives here in town.

774
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,629
But he was a little
out of your price range,

775
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,854
so you flipped through Wagner's hate
mail, and you discovered that

776
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,411
chef Antonio was the perfect candidate.

777
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:46,874
You knew Antonio's signature dish
was his wild mushroom risotto,

778
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,239
so what did you do?

779
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:52,822
You tracked down
some death cap mushrooms,

780
00:37:52,823 --> 00:37:55,257
and baked 'em into a risotto
that resembled Antonio's.

781
00:37:55,258 --> 00:37:57,040
But you made two mistakes.
First...

782
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:01,133
You sliced your mushrooms into
cubes instead of strips, and second...

783
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,877
Wagner noticed that
his risotto was cold.

784
00:38:04,878 --> 00:38:08,251
Why would risotto be served cold
in a five-star restaurant?

785
00:38:09,064 --> 00:38:13,130
Because... Antonio didn't cook it.
You snuck it in.

786
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:16,754
We just had a surprise
inspection a few days ago.

787
00:38:16,987 --> 00:38:19,496
A simple call to the county
will confirm that there were no real

788
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,377
health inspectors at
antonio's restaurant that night.

789
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:23,606
You posed as one.

790
00:38:23,607 --> 00:38:26,259
And that gave you the cover you need
to switch out the risotto

791
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,993
with your poisoned batch.

792
00:38:35,973 --> 00:38:36,981
Stop!

793
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,787
Wagner died, Antonio was arrested,

794
00:38:39,788 --> 00:38:42,099
and no one suspected
you were the real killer.

795
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:43,605
This... This is preposterous!

796
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:46,492
You can't just walk in here and
accuse someone of being a murderer!

797
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,001
Well, actually we can.

798
00:38:51,446 --> 00:38:52,971
Damn right we can.

799
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:56,892
They guy you went to about the mushrooms
remembers exactly what you look like.

800
00:38:56,893 --> 00:39:00,040
After he toned down
the drug-induced exaggerations.

801
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:01,406
Tall guy...

802
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:04,074
Orange cheese powder
around the mouth...

803
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,856
And a hippo logo on his sleeve.

804
00:39:05,906 --> 00:39:07,846
Al Mooney is insane!

805
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:10,256
- Nobody will believe what he says.
- Hang on a minute.

806
00:39:10,257 --> 00:39:12,642
I don't believe anyone said
the witness' name.

807
00:39:13,405 --> 00:39:14,696
You're under arrest.

808
00:39:16,171 --> 00:39:18,841
- Cuff him, guys.
- Busted.

809
00:39:20,536 --> 00:39:21,852
I want to talk to a lawyer.

810
00:39:25,317 --> 00:39:28,919
Looks like you're finally able
to communicate your visions again.

811
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:30,818
It feels good
to be back, Jules.

812
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:32,926
Matter of fact, I'm having
another vision right now.

813
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:36,397
You and me celebrating
over dinner, drinks.

814
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:39,311
Hmm, sounds like
you're still a little off.

815
00:39:40,573 --> 00:39:43,118
- Whew, another case solved.
- Yeah.

816
00:39:43,143 --> 00:39:44,685
Now, let just get your to the airport.

817
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,997
For what... My flight left
five minutes ago.

818
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:50,085
Are you mad?

819
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,204
No...

820
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:54,103
Why would I be mad
at you, Gus, huh?

821
00:39:56,511 --> 00:39:58,791
Guys, there's been
a bank Robbery downtown.

822
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:00,082
Chief Vick's asking for you.

823
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,787
A bank Robbery.
Man, that sounds exciting.

824
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:04,613
You guys don't mind
if I tag along, do you?

825
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,011
- Well...
- Of course not.

826
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:07,073
Wait for me.

827
00:40:08,804 --> 00:40:11,190
Don't worry, I have a plan.

828
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:16,304
Gus, take it easy.

829
00:40:16,843 --> 00:40:19,917
And, Shawn, don't forget
to vacuum the office every night.

830
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:21,589
I'm all over it, uncle Burton.

831
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,480
Matter of fact,

832
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:25,505
you might just want to check out
this little ditty before you go.

833
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:27,053
What's that?

834
00:40:27,054 --> 00:40:30,135
Well, Gus, I learned from your uncle
that I need to be a better assistant.

835
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,295
So I have taken the liberty to draw up
a new employment contract

836
00:40:33,296 --> 00:40:37,412
that spells out the duties of the
psychic detective's non-psychic associate.

837
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:39,765
- Assistant.
- Assistant.

838
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:42,728
Things like cleaning,
emptying the trash,

839
00:40:42,729 --> 00:40:44,433
- doing the dishes...
- Thank you, Shawn.

840
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:45,636
- I'll sign it later.
- Nah,

841
00:40:45,637 --> 00:40:47,911
sign it now before
he changes his mind.

842
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:50,886
- Yeah, Gus, before I change my mind.
- I'm not signing that, Shawn.

843
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,595
- And why the hell not?
- Because...

844
00:40:55,464 --> 00:40:57,455
Look, uncle Burton,

845
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,283
I gotta tell you something, and
I know you're gonna be disappointed.

846
00:41:00,317 --> 00:41:03,428
I know, I know.
You're confused because I'm here.

847
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:05,887
You don't know whether
to sign it "Burton" or "Gus".

848
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:07,435
Let me tell you, son.

849
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:11,339
Your psychic abilities help solve crimes,
it makes the world a better place.

850
00:41:11,778 --> 00:41:14,581
Thanks to you, the Burton legacy
will live on.

851
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,653
So sign that thing any way you want to.
You've got my blessing.

852
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,765
Is that what you were
going to tell me?

853
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,028
- Pretty much.
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

854
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:27,477
Take it easy, fellas.

855
00:41:29,557 --> 00:41:30,614
We'll see ya.

856
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:41,590
Well, there you have it.
You can sign it any way you want.

857
00:41:41,893 --> 00:41:43,626
I'm not signing that, Shawn.

858
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:45,864
Dude, you can sign
anything you want.

859
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:46,872
He said.

860
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:49,776
You could sign it
"Don Cheadle."

861
00:41:49,813 --> 00:41:50,809
I'm not signing.

00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,542
