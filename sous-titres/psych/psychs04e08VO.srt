1
00:00:02,059 --> 00:00:04,399
Shawn, we shouldn't left our troop.

2
00:00:04,524 --> 00:00:06,813
Dude, this is a chance
to put our skills to a real test.

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,561
What was that?

4
00:00:12,686 --> 00:00:15,587
It was nothing.
Your little lil'chief senses are off.

5
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:18,142
Okay, tell me you didn't hear that.

6
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:20,868
Probably just a giant beaver.

7
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:22,436
A giant beaver?

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,287
Dagnabbit, what is it?

9
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:27,693
Run!

10
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:36,697
Wandering off is about the dumbest thing
you've ever done.

11
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:39,069
Do you know
how dense this forest is?

12
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:42,293
Dense enough for a werewolf to run amok
and swallow me like a rollo.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,086
- Werewolves, huh?
- Yeah, didn't you hear them?

14
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:48,916
The mind can convince itself of almost
anything when fear is involved.

15
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:53,052
But fear does not exist
in this dojo, does it, boys?

16
00:00:56,908 --> 00:00:57,908
Help me.

17
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:00,726
We're out of here.

18
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,981
<i>The following is the royal rumble!</i>

19
00:01:17,262 --> 00:01:18,512
"Hacksaw" Jim Duggan.

20
00:01:18,637 --> 00:01:21,325
Winner of the first-ever rumble
in 1988.

21
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,083
- Old school.
- You even got the 2x4. All right.

22
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:27,004
Look at you.
We both went retro.

23
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,826
Although he should have
a vast and unruly beard.

24
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:32,224
I didn't want to draw on his face.
But don't worry,

25
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:34,900
the most important component
is still intact.

26
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,096
What?

27
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:40,393
Sylvester Ritter, aka Junkyard Dog.

28
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:43,477
The most prolific
and electrifying wrestler of his time.

29
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,893
May he rest in peace.

30
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:46,018
Amen.

31
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:51,149
Is it a little weird
that we still...

32
00:01:51,274 --> 00:01:53,237
This might have to be the last year
for the dolls.

33
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,733
Kinda creepy.

34
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:57,158
Let's cover them with something.

35
00:01:57,607 --> 00:01:58,607
Hurry.

36
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:09,003
Please say
you're the psychic detectives... please.

37
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:11,964
I'm the psychic detective.
He just has a magic 8-ball head.

38
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,347
Okay, terrific.
Okay, this is good.

39
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:16,646
Stewart Gimbley.
I need you to lock me up

40
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:18,652
and observe my behavior overnight.

41
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:19,930
You're my last hope.

42
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,843
- Dude!
- No, it's for your own protection.

43
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,524
Are those silver bullets?

44
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,154
I went to the cops,
and I told them to put me in a cell.

45
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,759
And the detective said,

46
00:02:36,884 --> 00:02:39,074
"jail is for criminals,
not delusional whackadoos."

47
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,657
He said "whackadoos"?

48
00:02:40,782 --> 00:02:43,078
And then he pinched himself
and told me to come see you guys.

49
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,956
And what, exactly,
does this detective look like?

50
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,210
Imagine Robert Goulet
dressed like Mr. Bean

51
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,943
playing the scarecrow in a summer stock
production of the <i>Wizard of oz</i>,

52
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:53,630
dedicated to Tony Randall.

53
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:59,011
So, Stewart, why do you feel
you need to be locked up and observed?

54
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,224
I'm almost positive I'm a lycan.

55
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,768
Lichen? Like seaweed?

56
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:07,561
No, a lycan.

57
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:09,645
You mean a lychee.

58
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,649
- Like sheep's wool.
- Lychee is a drupe fruit.

59
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:13,661
A lycan. Lycanthrope.

60
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:15,653
Werewolf?

61
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:18,023
What?

62
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,329
"Dee's nuts."

63
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:26,792
I don't get it.

64
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:32,126
I think I did that last night.

65
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,255
You think you killed a little lamb?

66
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:37,383
Tonight could be much worse.

67
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:40,636
I was gonna ask my sister to watch me,
but I love her

68
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,487
and clearly fear for her safety.

69
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:44,515
- Rumble's about to start any second.
- It's on.

70
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,663
- I don't really feel like...
- I can pay you thrice your normal rate.

71
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:52,173
I'm not doing it for half price,
I'll tell you that.

72
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,148
That's three times the amount.

73
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:56,850
- I've heard it both ways.
- No, you haven't.

74
00:03:57,126 --> 00:03:58,087
It's starting.

75
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:00,236
- The rumble's on.
- We can throw him in the corner.

76
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:02,914
- It's a lot of money.
- It's not like he's really a werewolf.

77
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,662
House rules are as follows.
One...

78
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,510
- No talking during the rumble.
- Two...

79
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:11,917
You leave here at sunrise, never ever,
ever come back again. And three...

80
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,878
Touch the <i>quatro queso dos fritos</i>

81
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,964
and I will take you down using basic,
traditional beginner's karate.

82
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:18,647
Deal.

83
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:20,805
You are truly lifesavers.

84
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,083
Now, please,

85
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,508
bind my extremities as best you can.

86
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:32,474
<i>Proving time and again here tonight.</i>

87
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:34,640
<i>Hacksaw is just hammering away.</i>

88
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:37,067
<i>He's hitting everybody in sight.</i>

89
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:42,737
- You sure you guys can handle this?
- Please, Stew, we're professionals.

90
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,186
Psych 408
"Let's Get Hairy"

Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

92
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,388
I got something.

93
00:06:03,787 --> 00:06:04,887
Right there.

94
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:11,703
Let's send Bambi back to ma.

95
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:14,295
On my word.

96
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:16,109
Ready...

97
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:18,038
Now!

98
00:06:21,776 --> 00:06:22,776
Red?

99
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:26,377
What the...
Who's there?

100
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:27,594
Who's there?

101
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,266
I will blow you to kingdom come.
You hear me?

102
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:36,953
You are messing
with the wrong son of a b...

103
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,777
Damn it,
I told you to stop doing that.

104
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:55,706
It's like watching someone
while they sleep.

105
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:57,916
Why were you reading that file
like Mr. Peanut?

106
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,202
I was curious.

107
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:02,412
Several distinguished military
strategists throughout history...

108
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:05,257
But you know what, I don't need
to explain myself to the likes of you.

109
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:08,427
"Dee's nuts"?

110
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,099
Stewart Gimbley. Ring any bells?

111
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,003
Yay high,

112
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:20,369
yellow eyes,

113
00:07:20,494 --> 00:07:21,899
howls at the moon.

114
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,612
This guy spent last night chained up
in our office

115
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,087
until he escaped and jumped
through our double-paned window.

116
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:31,200
- It's not even sort of double-paned.
- Wait.

117
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,868
He broke through his chains?

118
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,206
Figuratively, yes. Literally,
it was duct tape and kite string.

119
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,460
He chewed his way out with his big, bad
teeth, all the better to eat you with.

120
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,588
We were sleeping, so we can't confirm
how pointy his ears were.

121
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:47,043
- I didn't say ears.
- That's what I heard.

122
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:49,551
Me too. And now we have a broken window
that you should pay for.

123
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:50,914
Fat chance.

124
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,158
Here.

125
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:55,658
Why don't you go look for your lost pet
at his place of business.

126
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,643
"Occultopuss"?

127
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,813
Even though I wouldn't lock him up
because he was from the planet Wolfen,

128
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:04,938
he still told me to come down and have
my palm read by his sister... Willow.

129
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,482
You're saying you've worn that shirt
for at least two days in a row.

130
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:11,731
- Remove yourself from this place.
- You sure you don't want to tag along?

131
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:14,121
I would rather adopt a child.

132
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,361
Copy that.

133
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,052
- Occultopuss?
- Yes. But first... Jules?

134
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:22,582
Sorry, no time
for your tomfoolery and silliness.

135
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:25,365
That goes for your nonsense,
malarkey, and shenanigans.

136
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,281
We need a favor, it's legit,
and we promise to owe you big.

137
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:29,800
Make it quick.

138
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,521
I didn't have
anything else sanitary.

139
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,900
I used to have one of these
with wonder woman's face on it.

140
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:36,598
- Me too.
- It's a hair.

141
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,090
- We need to know where it came from.
- More specifically,

142
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:41,448
whether it came
from a wolf or a were-hybrid.

143
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:43,405
- Were-hybrid.
- Please,

144
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,941
this could be a matter
of life and death. Or mange.

145
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,404
Sweet!
Use the bat phone.

146
00:09:03,497 --> 00:09:04,918
Book of shadows.

147
00:09:11,211 --> 00:09:12,050
Hey there.

148
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,735
My name is Shawn Spencer.

149
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,425
My associate Ron Davis,
aka Bob Adams.

150
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,434
Known to his coven simply
as rich fingerlind.

151
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:22,089
You're a warlock?

152
00:09:22,548 --> 00:09:25,688
No, but Halle Berry
calls me "Black Magic".

153
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:27,482
- You're never met her.
- Yes, I have.

154
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,304
On the set of <i>Gothika</i>.

155
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:34,656
That's right, I always forget.
He directed <i>Gothika</i>.

156
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:37,409
- May I help you?
- That depends. Are you Willow Gimbley?

157
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,878
- I am.
- Great.

158
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:42,566
We just spent the evening with Stewart
at our psychic detective agency.

159
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,209
And it turns out
that he might be a lycan.

160
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:49,048
Not the drupe fruit. Rather,
the hairy biped that hunts and mauls.

161
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,633
I was afraid that could be the case.

162
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,928
Ever since he was bitten, he's been
acting peculiar and blacking out.

163
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,630
All signs point directly
to the mark of the beast.

164
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:00,140
Did you just say "bitten"?

165
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:03,518
We were on a mystical march
in the Dick Smith Wilderness

166
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,283
in Santa Ynez a few weeks ago.

167
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:07,947
We got lost, and he went off-trail
to make water in the darkness...

168
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:11,198
- That's when it happened.
- Sure hope he finished his business.

169
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:15,089
He said he saw teeth, fur, and a snout.
Not necessarily in that order.

170
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,233
He's been so elusive this past week.

171
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:21,527
He won't let me or any other
of the shamans in our rhombus help him

172
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:23,978
because he doesn't want
to put us in danger.

173
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:27,062
It's really starting to sink in.

174
00:10:28,765 --> 00:10:29,765
My big bro.

175
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,327
Any idea where he might be now?

176
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,928
We're fearless, we're trying to help,
and one of us is single.

177
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:40,180
And clearly goth-curious.

178
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:44,017
Trust us, you don't want the cops
to find him before we do.

179
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:47,609
I suspect he's hiding
and scared to death,

180
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,606
what with the third
and final full moon.

181
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,942
Which isn't exactly full,
just especially gibbous.

182
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,902
His need to feed tonight

183
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,476
will be more intense than anything
you can possibly imagine.

184
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:58,323
I see. Who are those people,

185
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,491
and why?

186
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:02,521
Friends, and a couple of the others
from Stewart's therapy group.

187
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:05,204
They're very close.
Stew's birthday last year.

188
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:08,647
- Is that shangri-lala's?
- Stew knows someone who works there.

189
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:11,712
We got half off the party package,
we got to bring our own vampire geisha.

190
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,453
Now, that's a party.

191
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:18,527
Please call us if Stewart shows up.
Our number's on the back, in pencil.

192
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,908
But feel free to use my work cell
on the front.

193
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,432
Please find my brother
before he eats an innocent.

194
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:28,090
"Bitten"? If she's telling the truth,
the man was bitten by a beast.

195
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:29,715
This may be above our pay grade.

196
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,091
Don't be the third Thompson twin
with the dreads.

197
00:11:32,216 --> 00:11:34,869
This is exactly at our pay grade.
Plus, we're his only hope.

198
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,444
Imagine being him right now?

199
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:38,888
Then you wouldn't be able
to get jiggy with his sister.

200
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:40,534
Don't you talk about her like that.

201
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,498
She's clearly in emotional peril,
and her heart is heavy.

202
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:45,996
And all that weird,
sexy makeup is just a cry for help

203
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:48,371
from a strong man with a solid job.

204
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:50,633
Look at you crushing on Vampira.

205
00:11:53,457 --> 00:11:54,421
Who is this?

206
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,094
I need you to come to leadbetter beach
and bring me a 36-hour survival basket.

207
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:03,347
Look, dad,
I'm a little tied up right now.

208
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,590
This is a challenge
that involves a former nemesis

209
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:07,476
and something I deserve.
Do you understand?

210
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,728
- Not even sort of.
- <i>Bring me</i>

211
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,813
two ham sandwiches
on stone ground wheat...

212
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:12,981
<i>Mustard, no mayo.</i>

213
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,855
Plenty of electrolyte liquids,

214
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,485
and a flashlight.

215
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:19,040
- Asap.
- <i>Okay, folks, here we go.</i>

216
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:21,827
<i>Keep your hands
on this brand new beautiful truck</i>

217
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:23,499
<i>and see how long you can last.</i>

218
00:12:23,624 --> 00:12:25,077
<i>Last man standing drives it home.</i>

219
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,567
No mercy, Spencer.

220
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,478
Hot off the wire,
another possible animal attack.

221
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,744
About 6 miles from where that poor lamb
was ripped apart two nights ago.

222
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:10,246
- Hunters?
- Must've been lousy shots.

223
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,874
Son of a bitch.

224
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:15,127
- What is it?
- My worst nightmare.

225
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,893
Spencer's gonna be calling me
any second. Let's go.

226
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:21,630
Right behind you. I'm just gonna
stop off at the ladies' room first.

227
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:32,769
Unbelievable.

228
00:13:33,258 --> 00:13:35,400
- This is getting serious.
- Dude,

229
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:39,109
- he completely forgot about his bag.
- What are you doing?

230
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,278
Preparing to playhot cross
bunson the recorder.

231
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,489
What it look like.

232
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,739
You can't go rifling
through another man's stuff.

233
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:48,660
Sure the privacy barrier was broken
when you duct-taped his thighs together.

234
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:51,370
It helped restrict the flexibility
in his hips.

235
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,450
"One capsule before bedtime."
What is Haloperidol prescribed for?

236
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:57,362
Schizophrenia. It also reduces
aggression towards others.

237
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,255
And used with chlorpromazine,
can control hiccups.

238
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,383
- What do you know about Dr. Ken Tucker?
- Psychiatrist. He's not on my route.

239
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,091
But he's doing well for himself.

240
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:07,304
He moved his practice
into new digs on Arthur avenue.

241
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,428
No kidding.

242
00:14:08,553 --> 00:14:10,599
This is the first time
we've had a case with a doctor

243
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,310
- who wasn't on your route.
- All streaks are made to be broken.

244
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,522
If this guy thinks stew needs
help controlling his aggression,

245
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,441
we should probably pay him a visit.

246
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:26,647
You weren't kidding. This guy's
feeling good about himself, huh?

247
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:28,414
His office is this way, Shawn.

248
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,032
Look at that.
Right on the door there.

249
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:40,523
Hello there, Myrtle.

250
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,022
My name is R.P. McMurphy.

251
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,585
This is my partner Cheswicke.

252
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,948
We both have some faulty
wiring up in our noggins,

253
00:14:47,073 --> 00:14:48,929
and we're gonna
have to talk to the doc.

254
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:51,348
No can do, sailor.
Push on!

255
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:54,559
- She totally shot me down.
- I got it.

256
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:57,854
Myrtle, when is
Dr. Tucker's next available session?

257
00:14:58,151 --> 00:14:59,147
April 25, 2011.

258
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,942
Now hit the bricks, Woodpecker.

259
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:06,529
Is there a standby option
for extra-crazy people

260
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:08,615
who very well may pose
a threat to others?

261
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:12,702
You have ten seconds to make
like my third husband and disappear.

262
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,020
I don't think we can hang
with this old bird.

263
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,548
Heavens to Betsy!
I'll be right there.

264
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:27,233
- Don't touch me!
- Polexia, calm down.

265
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:28,634
Don't tell me to calm down.

266
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,262
Myrtle, give me some help here.

267
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,430
Oh, dear.

268
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,432
What are you doing, Shawn?
Get from behind that desk.

269
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,851
- That woman is gonna kill you.
- Patient info.

270
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,464
- Your phone. I'll take a few pictures.
- Use your own phone.

271
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:41,356
- I left it in the car.
- Too bad for you.

272
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,650
- Just gimme your phone!
- She's gonna break it.

273
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,902
- Gimme the phone one time!
- Hurry up.

274
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,614
Dude, am I seeing what my brain
is telling my eyes that they're seeing?

275
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,734
That's me and Ruiz the koala.

276
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,485
I make a yearly donation
to the "bear with me" foundation

277
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,248
to help protect the lives
of these precious and unique creatures.

278
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:00,557
- You're cuddling the animal?
- We're nuzzling.

279
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:02,294
And Ruiz made the first move.

280
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:10,885
She comes.

281
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,516
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

282
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:18,435
Those boys are dumb as rain.

283
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:19,811
See you next week.

284
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:24,376
Actually,

285
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:25,693
you won't.

286
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:30,278
I have to go.
I'm late for work.

287
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:32,917
Don't do anything
you might regret, girly.

288
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:35,702
Remember why you came to us
in the first place.

289
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:40,378
Excuse us.

290
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:52,958
Would it be possible for us
to speak with the doctor

291
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,131
in a non-therapy capacity?

292
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:56,738
You know, like gentlemen.

293
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,932
Beat it.

294
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:02,070
- That was a disaster.
- I wouldn't go that far.

295
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:05,065
So if I was to nuzzle
with a non-domesticated zoo dweller,

296
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,634
- I think I'd go with a giraffe.
- Giraffes are chronic spitters.

297
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,154
I'd climb up and risk it.
They've got those giant doughnut lips.

298
00:17:12,454 --> 00:17:15,354
Like two Christmas hams
kissing under mistletoe.

299
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,573
Did that smokin' hot mess
look familiar to you?

300
00:17:17,698 --> 00:17:19,778
No, I would have remembered that.

301
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:24,919
All right. Fine.

302
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:27,379
I deserve this one.
Let's hear it.

303
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:30,298
For who? The boy?
That's on Gus' iPod.

304
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,217
- It's back at the office.
- Who?

305
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:34,678
Don't say a word
about Denise Williams.

306
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:35,595
Who?

307
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,793
There was another animal attack
last night.

308
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:39,557
And it wasn't a poor little lamb.

309
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,436
Seems your delusional little buddy's
upgraded to hunters.

310
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:49,021
Look who's suddenly
on the black and tan express.

311
00:17:49,146 --> 00:17:51,645
No, I don't think we're chasing
a werewolf, Spencer.

312
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,655
Just another cuckoo
who's seen too many movies.

313
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,241
Update: we don't have
any actual proof that Stewart...

314
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,459
He pretty much confessed to both of us,
and he has no alibi, remember?

315
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:02,346
Good luck getting by Dr. Tucker's
pit bull of a receptionist.

316
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:04,249
Maybe you just didn't have
the right tools.

317
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,462
The monocle isn't gonna help you
in this situation.

318
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,002
I'm talking about one of these.

319
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,213
Idiot.

320
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,008
- Anything back yet on the follicle?
- No,

321
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,176
but keep your phones on,
and proceed with caution.

322
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:18,282
This is our case now too.

323
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:21,277
Maybe we should
let them take it from here.

324
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:24,559
If we turn away every werewolf case
that comes through our doors,

325
00:18:24,684 --> 00:18:27,718
people are gonna start talking.
Besides, do you really think Stew

326
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:29,853
is sprouting hair and fangs,
unable to resist

327
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:31,842
some sort of blood lust
when the moon is full?

328
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,343
If he isn't, then he's some crazy dude
who thinks he is.

329
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:36,540
But what difference
if he's out there killing people

330
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:38,472
and precious wooly animals?

331
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:40,168
None, I guess.

332
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,916
<i>I have to go.
I'm late for work.</i>

333
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,168
Hold on.

334
00:18:48,686 --> 00:18:51,286
- What is it?
- Check out those pictures.

335
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:55,341
Dude, I knew
I'd seen that chick before!

336
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,678
She's a bartender at shangri-lala's.
Tell me I'm right.

337
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:01,037
Am I right?

338
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,699
She sure is.

339
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:04,473
Her name is Polexia.

340
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,353
Wasn't that Anna Paquin's name
in <i>Almost Famous</i>?

341
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,469
Anna Paquin was in <i>Almost Famous</i>?

342
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,690
Let's get a drink.

343
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,864
I'm gonna need to speak
with Dr. Ken tucker immediately.

344
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:20,241
Well, if it ain't little dorothy

345
00:19:20,553 --> 00:19:21,868
and her pal scarecrow.

346
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:24,788
Where's the tin man
and the cowardly lion?

347
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:29,484
Well, here's the tin man...

348
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:32,295
And here's toto.

349
00:19:35,127 --> 00:19:36,169
Follow me.

350
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:38,619
Obviously this is very troubling.

351
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:41,625
Does this look like the sort of thing
gimbley's capable of,

352
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,809
in your professional opinion?

353
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,809
Stewart has a very active
imagination.

354
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,341
- That's not what I asked.
- I heard what you asked.

355
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:50,048
What would you have me say?

356
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,689
I took an oath.

357
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:53,733
My job is to help people
like stewart

358
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,563
to overcome
the psychological hurdles

359
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:58,214
that impair their desire
to lead what we consider

360
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,740
to be normal, everyday lives.

361
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,116
Take a look around.

362
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,578
My success rate in this area speaks
for itself. Wouldn't you agree?

363
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,216
We're just trying to figure out
what we're dealing with here.

364
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:11,613
Two men are dead,
and tonight's another full moon.

365
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:14,295
I can't believe I just said that.

366
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,382
My opinion is that you're dealing
with a very troubled young man.

367
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,590
No kidding.

368
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,556
A few weeks ago, stewart took
a turn for the worse.

369
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:26,904
It is possible
he is blurring the lines

370
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:29,727
between reality
and a much darker fantasy.

371
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:32,345
At the end of our last session,
he even became emotional

372
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,233
and, uh... gave me a hug.

373
00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:38,486
- Why would he do that?
- In the event he never saw me again.

374
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:40,989
Yeah, do you have any idea
where he might be?

375
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,265
I wish I knew.

376
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:45,034
Someone needs to save him
from himself.

377
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,209
Hello, gentlemen.

378
00:20:53,443 --> 00:20:54,376
What'll it be?

379
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,841
Well, he would like a roy rogers.
That much we know for certain.

380
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:58,966
What?

381
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:02,343
You look really familiar to me.

382
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:05,138
Yeah, I've just got
one of those faces, I guess.

383
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:07,140
Nope, I don't...
I don't think so.

384
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,691
I'm almost positive
I've seen you before.

385
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,403
Wait a second.

386
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,134
Are you a patient of Dr. Ken tucker?

387
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,405
I knew it! I totally knew it.
We were just there earlier today.

388
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,466
I'm trying to get my buddy here
an appointment.

389
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:24,050
He's absolutely stir crazy.

390
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:25,825
Yeah, and skip here
has romantic dreams

391
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,154
about firemen who look like
dolph lundgren.

392
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,788
What?
You cheeky screwball.

393
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:32,529
What'd I tell you, he's wacko.

394
00:21:32,654 --> 00:21:35,342
It was late, you were in a firehouse,
and you slid down this large pole...

395
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:36,779
- Why?
- You started it.

396
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:37,774
Okay, fine.

397
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:40,300
Have you enjoyed your experience
with Dr. Tucker?

398
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,774
He comes highly recommended by
a fellow named stewart gimbley.

399
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:46,929
Stewart gimbley.
Yeah, I know that little weirdo.

400
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,354
I dialed him up with a great deal
on our birthday package last year.

401
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,809
God, what a freak.

402
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:53,409
You know, he told me once

403
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:55,813
that his father is some sort
of demon rabbi.

404
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:58,009
Yeah, that sounds about right.

405
00:21:58,134 --> 00:22:00,939
But as far as the doc goes, I mean,
if we really wanted an appointment...

406
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:03,905
Look, I'm probably not the best
person to ask about Dr. Tucker.

407
00:22:04,474 --> 00:22:05,448
And why is that?

408
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:08,242
'Cause I don't think
i'll be seeing him anymore.

409
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:11,812
I'm not sure anyone will,
actually. Capiche?

410
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:16,793
No, I... not really. No.
Could you elaborate?

411
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:19,403
I shouldn't say anything else.

412
00:22:20,503 --> 00:22:23,027
Look, there are plenty
of shrinks in this town.

413
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:24,152
Trust me.

414
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:27,637
Did you decide
on something to drink or what?

415
00:22:28,756 --> 00:22:29,779
Yes, I have.

416
00:22:29,904 --> 00:22:31,404
I'd like a sloe gin fizz, please.

417
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:33,522
Hold the gin, extra fizz.

418
00:22:33,647 --> 00:22:34,936
I'll have more cherries.

419
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:11,025
Help me. Please.

420
00:23:12,495 --> 00:23:13,591
Help me.

421
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:22,400
Okay, this is really, really...

422
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,501
- Really not good.
- Of course it's not.

423
00:23:26,626 --> 00:23:29,490
I woke up next to a pair of dead
hunters who were torn to shreds.

424
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,326
I'm sorry, I can't focus until
we handle this wardrobe issue.

425
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,066
Agreed.

426
00:23:36,441 --> 00:23:38,933
You know what, you can use
my halloween costume from last year,

427
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:40,417
which is in storage here.

428
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,378
- Really?
- There's a banker's box

429
00:23:42,503 --> 00:23:44,172
with a hand-drawn
jack-o-lantern on it.

430
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,465
Costume's inside.

431
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:53,816
We need to call lassiter and juliet

432
00:23:53,941 --> 00:23:56,067
and make a citizen's arrest now,
while he's docile.

433
00:23:56,192 --> 00:23:58,127
Since when do we make
citizen's arrests?

434
00:23:58,252 --> 00:24:01,544
Since a guy showed up naked,
covering his junk with balloons,

435
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:03,863
saying he woke up smack
next to the victims.

436
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,944
- Something feels off.
- What feels off?

437
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,463
I don't know yet.

438
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:12,908
That was impossibly fast.

439
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:15,726
You even put on the glasses.

440
00:24:16,285 --> 00:24:18,565
- Who am I supposed to be?
- Are you kidding?

441
00:24:19,086 --> 00:24:21,814
- You didn't watch television as a kid?
- Not after poltergeist.

442
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:25,315
You are none other than dwayne
cleophus wayne ofa different world.

443
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,800
A ladies' man with a plan.

444
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:27,695
What?

445
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:32,386
Stew, you know you've put us
in a tough spot coming back here.

446
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:33,816
I know.

447
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:35,431
I'll turn myself in.

448
00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:38,375
I don't know what else I could
have done. I warned everyone.

449
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,816
I can't live like this.

450
00:24:39,941 --> 00:24:41,646
I've never hurt anybody
my whole life.

451
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,502
Stew, look at yourself, man.
I mean, you're you.

452
00:24:44,627 --> 00:24:46,359
I can't believe
you're doing these things.

453
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:48,939
I know, but there isn't
a single shred of evidence

454
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:50,321
to suggest that I'm not.

455
00:24:50,627 --> 00:24:54,033
Can you think of anything you haven't
told us? Nothing can hurt your cause.

456
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:58,856
Willow disagrees,
but I have long since suspected

457
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:01,729
that our father, rabbi gimbley,
is actually a dybbuk,

458
00:25:01,854 --> 00:25:03,918
and that we might be the spawn
of demon seed.

459
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:07,063
Keeping in mind, of course,
that not all demons are bad.

460
00:25:07,188 --> 00:25:09,924
Take hellboy, for instance.
He's nice.

461
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,201
- Polexia wasn't kidding.
- Polexia? What-you...

462
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,437
Talked with the black widow?

463
00:25:15,562 --> 00:25:17,598
- You call her the "black widow"?
- Not just me.

464
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:19,851
All of us in the group.

465
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,189
She was married to a guy
without hair...

466
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:23,855
- What's that called?
- Bald.

467
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,998
- Alopecia.
- That's the fear of beans.

468
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,985
So one day, polexia
ties him up to the bed

469
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:30,690
and gags him and all that, you know,

470
00:25:30,815 --> 00:25:32,573
she was into
some very kinky business.

471
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,780
- Sure.
- Go on.

472
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,616
He had a heart attack and croaked.

473
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,052
But also, she used to
totally dominate our sessions,

474
00:25:38,177 --> 00:25:40,573
like her problems are
more important than ours.

475
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:44,625
But we put up with it
because she has voluptuous buttocks.

476
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:47,086
What do you mean "used to
dominate" your sessions?

477
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:50,965
Well, she once threatened dr. Tucker
during a neo-jungian sharing exercise,

478
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,509
and ever since then, she only
does one-on-ones with him.

479
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:54,751
Really?

480
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:00,558
We're taking you
to your sister at occultopuss.

481
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:01,812
We are?

482
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,877
The man is wanted for a double homicide
and first-degree lamb slaughter.

483
00:26:05,002 --> 00:26:06,765
I know this.
You think I don't know this?

484
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,255
Look, I'm taking a huge
leap of faith here, okay?

485
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,570
You are to stay put at occultopus until
you hear from us... Do you understand?

486
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:15,406
I can't put willow
in harm's way... it's unbrotherly.

487
00:26:15,623 --> 00:26:17,759
Listen, I don't think
you're gonna turn

488
00:26:17,884 --> 00:26:20,124
into a giant dog head tonight, okay?

489
00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:23,773
I'm getting serious vibes that you are
part of someone else's nefarious plan.

490
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:25,249
- Why?
- You're vulnerable.

491
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,789
And you look like that.
And you believe in weird things.

492
00:26:27,914 --> 00:26:29,936
Willow locks you in the bathroom,
just to be safe.

493
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:31,875
We're gonna get
to the bottom of this.

494
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,341
It all ends nice.

495
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:35,749
- You really think so?
- I do.

496
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:38,638
You're still a weird little dude,
you'll probably be single for some time.

497
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:41,515
But I think we can keep you
out of jail. Deal?

498
00:26:43,389 --> 00:26:44,940
- Deal.
- My man.

499
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,075
- Be careful.
- Don't worry, I got it.

500
00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:58,502
You drop that cooler in your backseat
off at the beach to my dad,

501
00:26:58,823 --> 00:27:00,974
then we lay low until
dr. Tucker's office closes.

502
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,125
- Then what?
- We finesse our way in.

503
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,672
We find some evidence that
stew's not a hairy monster,

504
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:09,039
and that it's actually polexia
that's behind all this nefariousness.

505
00:27:13,989 --> 00:27:17,998
It's wolf hair. Authentic wolf hair.
And we spoke to Dr. Ken tucker.

506
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:20,189
He said stewart is
a very troubled young man.

507
00:27:20,314 --> 00:27:21,179
No problem.

508
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:26,635
I hope you're right about this.

509
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,913
- Who was that?
- It was a wrong number.

510
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:38,560
Two hours till sundown.

511
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:41,325
Only ten of you left.
Who's gonna win this baby?

512
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,625
Shawn, where have you been?

513
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,458
Gus and I are working on a case,
the likes of which we've never seen.

514
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:50,747
That's every week.

515
00:27:50,872 --> 00:27:52,962
What's truly extraordinary is
this test of endurance.

516
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:55,123
Both mind and body have
to be very strong.

517
00:27:55,248 --> 00:27:56,131
Very strong.

518
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:59,284
Here you go, dad. It's everything you
asked for. Plus a couple extras...

519
00:28:00,116 --> 00:28:02,189
Daddy got a care package.

520
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:05,725
- You're wasting your breath, Zielinski.
- Must be your boy.

521
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,768
Keep an eye on your chakras,
everybody.

522
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:10,646
He's a 5'10" psychic detective,

523
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:13,981
which is more than I can say for
that mean-spirited daughter of yours.

524
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:18,029
- My height?
- She's an uncompromising chef.

525
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,031
She makes sandwiches at sub-zero,

526
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,199
and she refuses to hear me
when I say "no mayo."

527
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:23,863
That's my girl.

528
00:28:23,988 --> 00:28:25,995
Dad, am I sensing
a bitter history between you

529
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:28,622
and sam elliott's
younger brother harland?

530
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,665
He's my old nemesis.
Butch Zielinski.

531
00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:33,877
I told you all about him. He used to
step on my toes, steal my thunder.

532
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:35,742
- You could take him.
- Thank you, guster.

533
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:36,591
Agreed.

534
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,966
Now, the guy we're working for
thinks he's a werewolf.

535
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:42,370
- Whip garlic at him. That's all I got.
- That's for vampires.

536
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:44,847
Look, I simply cannot afford
any distractions.

537
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:47,600
Today is all about me, me, me...

538
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,519
And that hemi v-8, which,
i'll have you know,

539
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,805
churns out an astonishing
390 horsepower, guster.

540
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:55,775
Can't you smell it?

541
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:56,933
I drive an echo.

542
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,329
All right...

543
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:01,311
Here's a few freebies.

544
00:29:01,436 --> 00:29:04,372
Casey kasem here with the manicure,
clearly not a truck guy.

545
00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:06,025
You know he's early-exit fodder.

546
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,953
Woman by the side mirror
is a germaphobe.

547
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:09,872
Sneeze in her direction,
she's out of here.

548
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,994
And the young buck staring across
the bed at mounds mcclintock there

549
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:15,650
would like nothing more than
to take his hands off the hard body,

550
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:17,254
and put it on the soft one.

551
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:18,871
I'll be damned.

552
00:29:19,747 --> 00:29:21,342
I didn't clock the germaphobe.

553
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:23,361
You're welcome.
High five.

554
00:29:23,818 --> 00:29:25,875
Just kidding. Focus.

555
00:29:27,443 --> 00:29:28,621
Go get 'em, pop.

556
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:33,759
Wait for it.

557
00:29:34,713 --> 00:29:35,813
Wait for it.

558
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,884
You took a picture of his schedule.

559
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,611
There's nothing impressive about knowing
when he's exiting the building.

560
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,113
Wait for it...

561
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:58,194
- Let's do this.
- Do what?

562
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,922
We still don't have a plan yet.

563
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:04,626
Would you stop being a baby?

564
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:07,809
We just have to stash ourselves
until Myrtle leaves.

565
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:09,893
What's wrong
with the men's bathroom?

566
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,674
We're men.
How's that not obvious?

567
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:13,044
Myrtle is a woman.

568
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:15,781
If she has to use the bathroom,
she's coming in here.

569
00:30:29,198 --> 00:30:32,195
Think you're ready for this night train,
Johnny Murdock?

570
00:30:33,443 --> 00:30:34,543
Think again.

571
00:30:39,017 --> 00:30:40,805
You wish you were Johnny Murdock.

572
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,180
Shut up, Shawn!

573
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:45,715
Never underestimate the swiss!

574
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,553
I was underestimating you, Shawn.

575
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,840
What are we looking for, exactly?

576
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:51,215
Polexia's file.

577
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,392
And any snacks you can find.

578
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,272
Let's just pretend
that didn't happen.

579
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:02,526
For the record, I'm only doing this
because Stewart might be innocent.

580
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:03,611
Might.

581
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,409
That and you want to have a half-black
Fairuza Balk baby with his sister.

582
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:10,323
Question is,
whatever will you name it?

583
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:12,095
Well, if it's a girl,

584
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,454
Lavender, of course.

585
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,833
If it's a boy,

586
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,715
Deandre Pride Guster.

587
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:18,918
- Dude.
- What?

588
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,530
- Polexia's file is gone.
- What do you mean "gone"?

589
00:31:21,655 --> 00:31:24,924
There's a tab that says "Polexia Li",
but the file is gone.

590
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,551
That's a major bummer.
Gimme the swiss.

591
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:29,621
See if you can find Stew's file.

592
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,494
Okay, here we go.

593
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:33,669
Here it is.

594
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,350
Let's see...

595
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,481
"I fear that Stewart's condition
is worsening.

596
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:44,639
"He's completely ravaged by delusions
and uncontrollable homicidal impulses."

597
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:54,245
I don't think
she was wearing underwear.

598
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,760
"He may pose a grave danger
to himself and others.

599
00:31:56,885 --> 00:31:58,629
"I'm afraid
there's only one recourse.

600
00:31:58,754 --> 00:32:00,876
"He must be committed
to a psychiatric facility."

601
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,796
Shawn, are you hearing this?

602
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,382
Dr. Tucker wrote this
at Stewart's last session.

603
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,300
- We have to go. Willow's in danger.
- Wait.

604
00:32:08,884 --> 00:32:09,635
What?

605
00:32:10,224 --> 00:32:11,956
Do these look right to you?

606
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:16,535
- The label says Haloperidol, but...
- I knew it!

607
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,501
Only for the last 11 seconds,
but still...

608
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:20,880
- What's actually in the bottle?
- I don't know.

609
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,638
- Horse tranquilizers, maybe.
- Horse tranquilizers?

610
00:32:23,763 --> 00:32:26,151
- What do you know about taxidermy?
- What don't I know about it?

611
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,863
I'm a part of the largest campaign
to abolish the practice completely.

612
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,691
- That owl cost five grand?
- No way.

613
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,951
- What about the beaver?
- No beaver is worth that much.

614
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,643
It would take a larger game.

615
00:32:35,768 --> 00:32:37,764
A moose head, or possibly a cougar.

616
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:38,956
Or a gray wolf.

617
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:43,910
- It's neither Stewart nor Polexia.
- Exactly.

618
00:32:44,035 --> 00:32:45,588
We gotta get back to Occultopuss.

619
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:55,681
Black Magic.
Is everything okay?

620
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,766
Please tell us Stew is still here.

621
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,761
Okay, I know that you said
to wait for you guys to get back,

622
00:33:00,886 --> 00:33:03,105
but Dr. Ken Tucker came by,
and he was very grim.

623
00:33:03,466 --> 00:33:06,070
He said that Stewart might try
to harm himself, and/or me,

624
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:08,110
and that he was the only one
who can help him.

625
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,404
You let Dr. Ken Tucker
take your brother?

626
00:33:11,035 --> 00:33:11,780
Sorry.

627
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,346
Dr. Tucker has been looking
after Stew for over a year.

628
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:16,952
- I just met you guys today!
- What does this mean, Shawn?

629
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:20,911
It means somebody's about to die.

630
00:33:30,582 --> 00:33:31,717
Personal address...

631
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,551
I know. I said I've got it.

632
00:33:33,676 --> 00:33:34,845
Well, find it.

633
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,014
What the hell is going on here?

634
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,974
119 Lincolnwood Place.

635
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:42,853
119 Lincolnwood Place.

636
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,496
Sweet. Juliet, write that down.

637
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:47,399
This woman, Polexia Li,
is tonight's unlucky victim.

638
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,392
I know her.

639
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:50,470
Wasn't that Anna Paquin's name
in <i>Almost Famous</i>?

640
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:51,945
She was in <i>Almost Famous</i>?

641
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,148
<i>'Cause I don't think
I'll be seeing him anymore.</i>

642
00:33:54,273 --> 00:33:55,893
<i>I'm not sure anyone will,</i>

643
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:57,326
<i>actually. </i>Capiche<i>?</i>

644
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,952
Yes! And she was having
an affair with Dr. Ken Tucker.

645
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,956
Not Anna Paquin, Polexia.
She was his patient.

646
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,846
He tried to end it,
she went ballistic.

647
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:07,044
She's gonna spill the beans
and cost him his marriage.

648
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,631
And more importantly,

649
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:11,215
his thriving practice,
and he can't have that.

650
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:12,549
Worst of all,

651
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:16,053
he's methodically set up Stewart
to take the fall.

652
00:34:16,494 --> 00:34:18,046
- How?
- It'll sound ridiculous.

653
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:20,974
It makes more sense to catch him,
and then let me do my thing.

654
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,581
- Where is she now?
- You wrote down where she lives.

655
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:25,604
She tends bar at Shangri-Lala's.

656
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,897
A 15-block radius.

657
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,858
She could be at either place
or anywhere in between because...

658
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,403
the buses stopped running
an hour ago, so...

659
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,613
I'm getting a vibe
that she walks from work.

660
00:34:35,222 --> 00:34:37,886
Fine, you two hit Shangri-Lala's,
and we'll take care of the rest.

661
00:34:38,011 --> 00:34:39,660
- I'm coming too.
- I'm riding shotgun!

662
00:35:12,617 --> 00:35:14,267
We are down to two.

663
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:17,364
It is down to Butch and Henry,
<i>mano a mano</i>.

664
00:35:25,928 --> 00:35:27,708
Excuse me.
Where's Polexia?

665
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:29,501
She felt sick, I let her go.

666
00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:40,721
Strike two, then.
She's definitely not here.

667
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,557
Yes, I have the right address.
It's the one you divined!

668
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:52,909
Hello, is someone there?

669
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:33,975
Hey, I have mace!

670
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:44,993
You just about gave me a heart attack,
you son of a bitch!

671
00:36:45,502 --> 00:36:46,787
What are you doing here?

672
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:49,748
I wanted to apologize
for being so insensitive.

673
00:36:51,102 --> 00:36:52,417
It's too late for that.

674
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,787
No, it's not too late.
We can work it out.

675
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:56,404
I love my wife,

676
00:36:56,529 --> 00:36:58,841
but I really do enjoy
having sex with you.

677
00:37:00,692 --> 00:37:02,396
That's the best you've got?

678
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,128
Pretty soon, everyone will know
just how pathetic you really are.

679
00:37:06,253 --> 00:37:08,498
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.

680
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,562
It didn't have to end this way.

681
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:13,173
Freeze!

682
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:15,315
SBPD. Hands in the air!

683
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:18,026
You don't understand.
She's very sick, I was trying to help.

684
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,438
I don't think so.

685
00:37:19,563 --> 00:37:20,863
And woman to woman,

686
00:37:21,726 --> 00:37:23,365
it's time to ixnay this shortcut.

687
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:27,995
Way to be, partner!
Put your hands behind your back.

688
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:29,167
Check up there.

689
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:31,985
Great work from the whole team!

690
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,203
He's bound to have Stew
stashed up there somewhere.

691
00:37:34,328 --> 00:37:36,295
I haven't seen Stewart
in over a week.

692
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,663
I've got Stew!

693
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:39,945
That was impossibly fast.

694
00:37:40,695 --> 00:37:43,302
What the hell kind of sick charade
were you planning out here?

695
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:54,591
You see...

696
00:37:54,893 --> 00:37:56,940
He couldn't just kill Polexia
in cold blood.

697
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,816
She was bound to have told someone.

698
00:37:59,129 --> 00:38:00,402
He needed a patsy,

699
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,820
and in walks Stew.

700
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,322
Over the edge and convinced
he'd been bitten by a werewolf.

701
00:38:05,214 --> 00:38:07,264
Evil black light bulb goes off.

702
00:38:07,592 --> 00:38:09,922
First, Dr. Ken Tucker
gave Stew the wrong drugs

703
00:38:10,047 --> 00:38:11,872
to ensure that he'd be passed out.

704
00:38:12,504 --> 00:38:14,701
The next night,
he waltzed into our office,

705
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,246
where we slept under what we thought
was the blanket of protection

706
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:19,755
- a double-bolt lock provides.
- You never lock the door.

707
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:23,176
He smashed our window, stole Stew,
and killed two grizzled hunters

708
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,237
with an injection
of something I presume

709
00:38:25,362 --> 00:38:26,515
is untraceable.

710
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,014
Then he actually proceed
to wolf them up,

711
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,141
using the tastelessly
mummified claws

712
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,727
of the beastly pelt
that I now wear on my head

713
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,438
as a tribute to its power and grace.

714
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,706
It's an awful act...
Taxidermy!

715
00:38:39,544 --> 00:38:41,485
And, of course,
the murder thing too.

716
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:46,073
And finally,
he branded Stew with a pentagram,

717
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:48,450
and left him unconscious.

718
00:38:49,711 --> 00:38:51,036
All leading to tonight,

719
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,039
when he would kill Polexia
and let poor Stewart confess.

720
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:58,001
For what it's worth,
I went into the woods to kill a deer.

721
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,253
The hunters were
a mere crime of opportunity.

722
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,073
A happy accident.

723
00:39:02,198 --> 00:39:03,806
That's worth absolutely nothing.

724
00:39:05,629 --> 00:39:07,579
You're the sickest of us all.

725
00:39:09,455 --> 00:39:12,093
Well, Spencer,
I guess I should have listened to you.

726
00:39:12,218 --> 00:39:15,102
- No one else would have either, so...
- You're gonna pay for our window?

727
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,562
Yeah, right.
That's rich.

728
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:24,277
Gus gave them to me.

729
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:25,487
Just in case.

730
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:28,313
Of course he did.

731
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:31,493
- Good thinking.
- You can never be too safe.

732
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,764
Where am I?

733
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:47,526
I feel like a baby.

734
00:39:47,908 --> 00:39:49,826
That's because
you're wearing a diaper.

735
00:39:50,464 --> 00:39:53,265
But you're gonna be okay, big bro.
Thanks to these guys.

736
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,267
How can we possibly repay you?

737
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:58,249
Maybe you and Black Magic here
could get together and do some

738
00:39:58,374 --> 00:40:00,022
cauldron stirring sometime.

739
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:01,356
I'd love to.

740
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,607
Sounds good.

741
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:04,568
I think we should celebrate.

742
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,140
As soon as I am not naked anymore.

743
00:40:09,823 --> 00:40:10,657
Agreed.

744
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:19,115
You're ruthless, Henry.

745
00:40:20,572 --> 00:40:23,128
You are strong of mind,
but mean of heart.

746
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:26,069
We reap what we sow,
Zielinski.

747
00:40:26,786 --> 00:40:28,300
Time to pay the piper.

748
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:30,521
My plight is noble, Henry.

749
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,277
This vehicle's not for me,

750
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,876
but for the children of St. Thomas
of the Apostles Orphanage of Goleta.

751
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,001
Come on.

752
00:40:46,227 --> 00:40:47,327
Where did...

753
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:48,403
Look.

754
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:51,077
It's like
Pippi Longstocking's little sister,

755
00:40:51,202 --> 00:40:52,699
Patches Longstocking.

756
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:54,951
You don't look
much like the orphan type.

757
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:56,787
As an infant,

758
00:40:57,053 --> 00:41:00,999
after I was abandoned and left lakeside,
only to be found by big-fly fishermen,

759
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,127
it was the fine sisters
of St. Thomas of the Apostles

760
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,620
that raised the man
you see before you today.

761
00:41:07,304 --> 00:41:09,257
And when
that old station wagon caught fire

762
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,347
and the kids didn't have new wheels
to take 'em on their field trips,

763
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:13,822
I said, "Butch...

764
00:41:14,649 --> 00:41:16,271
"You know what you gotta do."

765
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,610
So here I am.

766
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,546
It's bigger than us, Henry.

767
00:41:20,671 --> 00:41:23,865
And don't worry, I'm gonna have
this thing fitted with a custom camper

768
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:27,567
so the kids can't fall off the back
onto the freeway at high speeds.

769
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:50,475
Are you okay?

770
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,218
You gave up your dream machine
to a guy you punched in a bowling alley.

771
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:56,220
He brought a nun! Sometimes
you gotta give one up for the team.

772
00:41:56,345 --> 00:41:58,337
You have to admit,
those were some cute kids.

773
00:41:58,462 --> 00:41:59,462
No doubt.

774
00:41:59,755 --> 00:42:02,832
You know what, that's actually
a really nice thing you just did.

775
00:42:02,957 --> 00:42:06,380
- You ought to be proud of yourself.
- I'm tired. I want waffles.

776
00:42:06,505 --> 00:42:08,876
- I could eat some waffles.
- I'm buying.

777
00:42:09,001 --> 00:42:10,369
Which means I'm buying.

778
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,094
You know that's right.
