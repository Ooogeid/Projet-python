00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:02,956
<i>In a battle drill...</i>

2
00:00:04,215 --> 00:00:05,652
All right, Shawn, that's it.

3
00:00:05,777 --> 00:00:08,797
Come on, up and at 'em. It's noon.
Half the day is gone.

4
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:10,091
<i>Mean firepower.</i>

5
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:12,099
Look at this, these guys right here.

6
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:14,753
What they're doing?
Jumping out of helicopters.

7
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:17,417
Look at that guy,
he's rappelling down a mountainside.

8
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:21,193
Look at everything they're getting done
while you're laying here slacking off.

9
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:23,794
What does that make you want
to do when you grow up?

10
00:00:24,277 --> 00:00:26,609
<i>Join the Army.</i>

11
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:30,445
Go into advertising.

12
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:32,156
It's a really catchy jingle.

13
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:35,208
Seriously,
I can't get it out of my head.

14
00:00:46,282 --> 00:00:47,504
Let me get this straight.

15
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:50,799
Hotel manager says she
found a body this morning,

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,146
but you're saying John Doe offed himself
20 hours ago.

17
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:56,164
When I said I wanted to see you,
this is not that I had in mind.

18
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,202
I thought you said
spending time together

19
00:00:58,327 --> 00:01:00,101
was more important than
what we were doing.

20
00:01:01,065 --> 00:01:03,104
Let me just solve this quickly,
and we can go.

21
00:01:08,246 --> 00:01:10,276
I do not believe this man
committed suicide.

22
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:12,684
Unfortunately, he was murdered.

23
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:15,198
- Wait, already? Are you sure?
- 41%.

24
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:16,407
Why, Shawn?

25
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:19,412
O'Hara, I think we got this one covered.
Spencer, why don't you get...

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,082
I'm sorry, did you...
bring a date to the crime scene?

27
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:27,255
It was either this or ice skating.
But I'm not anti-ice skating.

28
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,713
Do you have any idea
how inappropriate that is?

29
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:32,974
More inappropriate than yelling
at a co-worker in front of his date?

30
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:35,761
Why don't you zip it
and let me assess what's going on here

31
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:38,180
before you turn it into
a psychic crap fest.

32
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:44,757
Dude, the chair.
The chair he stepped on.

33
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:47,398
To hang himself, legs would have kicked
it backwards,

34
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:48,788
and yet it's forward.

35
00:01:48,913 --> 00:01:50,563
This is remedial stuff.

36
00:01:52,203 --> 00:01:55,675
I do not believe this man was alone
in the room when he died.

37
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:59,466
Enough! I'm already onto something
being fishy here without your help.

38
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:02,078
- Look at the position of the chair.
- Good boy, Lassie.

39
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,610
But come on,

40
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,543
half-naked John Doe...

41
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:08,162
No wallet, no I.D.

42
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:09,805
No identification.

43
00:02:10,803 --> 00:02:13,923
There's no card with the...
It's got the...

44
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,170
I'm seeking what?

45
00:02:15,295 --> 00:02:16,844
- An I.D. Card?
- There's not one.

46
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:19,804
Clearly you will need me
to read the body.

47
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:32,609
Check the throat. He's trying
to tell me something, but he can't.

48
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,979
I was just about to say that.
Check his throat.

49
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:43,304
Are those dog tags?

50
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,539
Crap, this guy was a soldier.

51
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:48,092
- What does this mean?
- It means

52
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:51,238
it's not just a possible homicide,
now it's a military crime.

53
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:54,256
I may know someone who can help.

54
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,642
- Hey, little sis.
- Ewan, hi.

55
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,185
I am so sorry to bother you.

56
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,470
I know you must be busy, but I just have
a couple of questions about this case.

57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,264
I'm never too busy for you.

58
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:48,351
- I'm sorry, are you at work?
- Yeah, cleaning out the inbox as usual.

59
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:51,104
- Can I call you back?
- Sure, but it'll only take a minute.

60
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:52,274
Same here.

61
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:02,738
Dude!

62
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,667
- Hey, sis, I was just gonna...
- <i>Alpha 4.</i>

63
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,209
This is not your sister.

64
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:15,713
Yeah, I gather.
Funny you should call now.

65
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:18,382
Mission complete.
Your docs are safe

66
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,677
and will be at the destination
and hopefully dry by 1600.

67
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:24,334
<i>America wins.</i>

68
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:25,609
Just in time.

69
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,470
As usual, you're a credit
to your country, Alpha Four.

70
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:37,534
Thank you for calling me back.

71
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:40,678
We have a soldier who was found hanging
in this motel room.

72
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:43,531
- What happen, he kill himself?
- <i>Well, maybe.</i>

73
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,461
Maybe somebody wants us to think that.
Hey, do you know why a soldier

74
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,123
would swallow his dog tags?

75
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:50,955
Unfortunately I do.
I saw it first hand in boot camp.

76
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,512
It's a symbol of shame.

77
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:54,459
Oh, man! Are you crazy?

78
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,263
Suicide is a disgraceful act,
especially for a soldier.

79
00:04:58,388 --> 00:05:01,052
So what happens is they...
They swallow their dog tags.

80
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:03,551
Listen, how'bout we talk
about this over dinner?

81
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:06,137
- You're in the country?
- <i>Better yet, I'm in the state.</i>

82
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,431
I'm headed towards Santa Barbara.

83
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:09,433
When?

84
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,060
I figure I'll float in around 9:00.

85
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,230
Great!

00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,109
Psych 410
"You Can't Handle This Episode"

Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

88
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,690
It's a big sandstorm.
We're in Dubai,

89
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:12,988
19 clicks from enemy lines,
and we're trying

90
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:15,207
to grab the hindquarters,
and finally I say "stop!

91
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,836
"You guys, we're gonna have to carry
this camel the rest of the way."

92
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:21,892
Carry the camel is...

93
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:23,466
humpin' it out.

94
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,591
What?

95
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,302
That's...

96
00:06:26,905 --> 00:06:28,461
That's an amazing story.

97
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:31,382
It sounds a little rehearsed,

98
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:33,267
as if you've told it
about a zillion times.

99
00:06:33,657 --> 00:06:36,603
I've never told that story before.
This is the first time.

100
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,031
Really?

101
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:40,783
Maybe a little embellished?

102
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:45,154
A little exaggerated. Believe me.
I do the same thing.

103
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,156
Actually,
I left most of the crazy stuff out.

104
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,489
I didn't want
to blow anybody's mind.

105
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,160
It was nothing, really.

106
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,805
But honestly, man,
from what my sis tells me,

107
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,264
you're the amazing one.

108
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:57,833
- You said that?
- I said you were prophetic.

109
00:06:58,224 --> 00:06:59,543
What? You're prophetic.

110
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:02,379
I was just really interested
in your kind of police work.

111
00:07:02,997 --> 00:07:05,616
Sure, I'm used to combat,
the nitty-gritty, extreme danger.

112
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:06,741
But you...

113
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,844
You do things on a higher level.

114
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:12,158
What did Juliet say about me?

115
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:17,061
Plenty.
I'd tell you, but I'd have to kill you.

116
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:22,914
Great,
now you're gonna tell everybody

117
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,944
about our family road trip to Epcot,
where you tortured me with Noogies?

118
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:30,491
Does the story end with him
carrying the car the last 19 clicks?

119
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,203
Watch out. You're never too old
to hop on the train to Noogieville!

120
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:36,086
The claw! Watch out!

121
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:40,478
This is great!

122
00:07:41,398 --> 00:07:42,711
I am so glad you're here,

123
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,172
and that you get to meet everybody.

124
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:46,737
Hey, I gotta ask.

125
00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:48,550
Is that a Walther PPK on your ankle?

126
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,386
It is.
Good eye, detective.

127
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:52,988
May I?

128
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:58,185
- Here you go.
- Oh, that is sweet.

129
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:00,988
Are you licensed
to carry in this state?

130
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,316
I'm licensed to carry on the planet.
It's one of 11 weapons on my person.

131
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,902
Anybody want to find
where they're hidden?

132
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,366
All right, back to work, everyone.

133
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,613
Autopsy report confirms
there was a severe neck fracture,

134
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:15,525
probably not caused by the hanging.

135
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,788
Looks like Shawn's hunch
about foul play might be right.

136
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:20,609
Let's pull out to the army base,
figure out why our private Starks

137
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,584
ended up dead in a motel room.

138
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,402
You should come with us.

139
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:27,005
- We could probably use your insight.
- And your 11 weapons.

140
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:39,184
Sorry, sir, we do not allow
civilians access to this base.

141
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,438
I figured you might say that, soldier.
But I'm hardly a civilian.

142
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,234
I am the head detective
for the Santa Barbara police department.

143
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,153
You don't have
the clearances necessary

144
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:50,612
I got you.

145
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:52,628
Gomer, Shawn Spencer,

146
00:08:52,753 --> 00:08:54,353
Paraguayan ambassador.

147
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:57,911
This is my attache, Ghee Buttersnaps,
aka "the heater".

148
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,679
We are here to deliver
a large ornamental fruit basket filled

149
00:09:00,804 --> 00:09:03,119
with native delicacies
to whoever runs this joint.

150
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,419
Ewan O'Hara.

151
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:09,673
Is that a DOD TS security clearance?

152
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,217
It is, I can assure you these folks
are not cause any trouble.

153
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:14,136
They just have
a few questions to ask.

154
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:31,562
As a former member of this institution
and a decorated soldier,

155
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:34,800
perhaps you can explain
to these civilians

156
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:37,875
that while the United States army
appreciates their concerns

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,287
about private Starks,
this is a military matter.

158
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,873
Absolutely, general.
But a soldier is dead.

159
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:46,029
I think these people are just trying
to do their due diligence.

160
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:48,854
I assure you we will conduct
a thorough investigation

161
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:51,006
- internally here on our base.
- Here's the thing...

162
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:53,140
It didn't happen on your base.

163
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:55,042
So you and I can sit here

164
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,138
and haggle over jurisdiction,
which we both know is murky at best.

165
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:01,207
Or you can give us access to your base,
let us do our work.

166
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:03,685
That, or we can start
hauling soldiers down to the station.

167
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,104
The coroner found evidence

168
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,690
that may conflict with the original
theory of self-infliction.

169
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:10,484
Thank you, young lady.

170
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,188
I'll be happy to pass that report on

171
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,877
to our highly skilled
militarypathologist.

172
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:17,783
Major general...

173
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:21,022
I got nothing.

174
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:24,121
I just like saying that.
Those two words in sequence.

175
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:25,634
"Major general."

176
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,273
- Try it.
- I don't want to.

177
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:29,008
- Just say it.
- I don't want to.

178
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:38,804
General, I just got off the phone
with Starks' parents.

179
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:41,223
They've requested
to pick up his things.

180
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,810
Thank you, lieutenant Wallach.

181
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,894
Yes, I spoke to the boy's parents
this morning myself.

182
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:48,105
Hardest call the army has to make.

183
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,590
- What is that?
- Sorry, sir.

184
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,819
It's my girlfriend Abigail.

185
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,237
She's been trying
to reach me all day.

186
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,449
We're in a phase in our relationship
that I simply can't get a handle on.

187
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:01,927
I would like to hear your thoughts.

188
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,539
I wouldn't presume to know your life.
Probably don't ask, don't tell.

189
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:09,793
I'm just gonna let it go
to voice mail.

190
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:11,784
Indeed.

191
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:13,765
Pack up his things.

192
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,911
We will need to look
through his belongings before.

193
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:19,911
And we're going to need to retrace
his steps leading to his death.

194
00:11:20,036 --> 00:11:22,537
We'd like to start
with his work assignments.

195
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:26,286
Very well.

196
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:29,611
Escort these civilians down
to private Starks' barracks,

197
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:32,225
- to the motor pool, where he worked.
- Motor pool! That's us.

198
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,581
We'll take the motor pool.
Dude, be all you can be.

199
00:11:34,913 --> 00:11:36,653
We'll need one of those hummers.

200
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,488
The open hummers that we saw.

201
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,033
And my partner will require
a corncob pipe.

202
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,078
Afternoon, soldier.
Ewan O'Hara.

203
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:47,122
This is Shawn Spencer.

204
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,667
He's a psychic detective
helping the SBPD.

205
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,791
Investigating the suicide
of private David Starks.

206
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,528
We heard. It was a shame.

207
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:56,798
This is his partner
Ghee Buttersnaps.

208
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,508
- That's not your real name.
- Oh, my gosh,

209
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:03,625
- Juliet didn't even tell you my name?
- Gus, please, let's focus.

210
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:07,017
Your pettiness ions are interfering
with my psychic ions,

211
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,353
creating
<i>recepto non grata interfero</i> bupkiss.

212
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,980
- What are you even talking about?
- This stuff is so cool.

213
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,024
How does this thing work?

214
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:19,404
Would you ask the Egyptians
how they built the pyramids?

215
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,240
Would you ask Yo-Yo Ma
how he makes music

216
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,224
sound like heaven?

217
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,505
Would you ask Iron Mike Sharpe
why he felt the need to shower

218
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,167
for more than 90 minutes
after wrestling for less than ten?

219
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:35,644
My point is, it's not a science.

220
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:37,172
For example,

221
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:40,926
- what is this thing?
- An armored personnel carrier.

222
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,177
Of course it is.

223
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:44,471
I meant in
at more philosophical level.

224
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:46,496
What...

225
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,100
is it?

226
00:12:56,871 --> 00:13:00,487
I am sensing that private Starks
was insubordinate and lazy.

227
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:02,071
A real sluff-off.

228
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,809
The opposite.
He was a model private.

229
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:07,247
One of the most conscientious soldiers
in the squad, in fact.

230
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:10,163
Please, soldier, don't interrupt me.
Never do that.

231
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,282
That was the next thing
I was going to say. Model soldier.

232
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:15,999
Exemplary.

233
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:17,124
Pristine.

234
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:20,552
But I am sensing
that he signed out of work last Monday,

235
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:23,009
and instead went to... dinner.

236
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:24,833
You must be getting "DNR",

237
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,972
which stands for "Did Not Report".

238
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:29,441
Any reason?

239
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:31,184
The only official reason a soldier

240
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,146
can legally sign out for work duty
is due to a sickness or an injury,

241
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:36,018
or for a meeting with a superior.

242
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:37,888
Excuse me, guys.

243
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,344
This is Alpha Four, go.

244
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,626
<i>Alpha Four,</i>

245
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:45,633
<i>what do you think you're doing?</i>

246
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,071
I am on vacation.

247
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,620
But what, exactly, do you think
you're doing on that base?

248
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:52,545
- How did you...
- <i>Come on, Four.</i>

249
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,417
You start flashing that clearance badge
around and alarms go off.

250
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,962
I'm helping my sister and the SBPD
with an investigation,

251
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,080
and I don't see
how any of that is your business.

252
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,884
<i>Everything you do is my business,</i>

253
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,709
<i>and everything that happens
on that base is the army's business.</i>

254
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:08,346
<i>Your instructions, Alpha Four,</i>

255
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,390
are to keep it that way.

256
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:12,558
- I don't follow...
- <i>Congratulations...</i>

257
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,328
Don't touch that!

258
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:17,307
<i>You just got yourself an assignment.</i>

259
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,568
If there is a bad seed on that base,
I want you to uncover them.

260
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,836
<i>Your orders:</i>

261
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:27,016
<i>do what it is you do to make sure
it never sees the light of day.</i>

262
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:28,141
Yes, sir.

263
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,799
Sir...

264
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,537
- The file your team asked for.
- Thank you, soldier.

265
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:42,796


266
00:14:57,989 --> 00:14:59,489
It's Abigail. Again.

267
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:02,516
You're acting like it's odd
to be calling you on the phone.

268
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:05,034
No, the phone is a device
that's been around for dozens of years.

269
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,401
That's not the odd part.

270
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:08,677
She's just being
awfully clingy lately.

271
00:15:08,802 --> 00:15:11,155
- Like I'm never doing enough.
- I don't know.

272
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,096
I think taking her to the dead guy show
was pretty good.

273
00:15:15,174 --> 00:15:16,456
You're right, I'm an idiot.

274
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,800
Before you even say anything,

275
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:23,181
I want to apologize for the dog tags
in the esophagus fiasco.

276
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:26,955
But I will be making it up to you
tonight... 8:00 p.m.

277
00:15:28,056 --> 00:15:28,969
Perfect.

278
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,674
So going through Starks's effects
before they were sent off

279
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,449
didn't raise any flags.

280
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,873
Good afternoon.

281
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:38,058
Nice of you to join us.
A lot has happened.

282
00:15:38,183 --> 00:15:39,979
Maybe you'd like to try
and catch up.

283
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:42,107
It is precisely 8:20 in the a.m.

284
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:45,735
- What could possibly have happened?
- What, did you just run a marathon?

285
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,659
While I may have been sleeping late,
I had very, very productive dreams.

286
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,118
I now know two new things.

287
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:56,794
One, the howler monkey
that wears the overalls

288
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,708
and plays the glockenspiel
is my inner child

289
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,041
pleading with me to cling
to my innocence.

290
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,166
And two,

291
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,293
the fact that Starks signed out of work
on Monday means something.

292
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,480
I admire your fortitude...

293
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:12,554
Maybe I've been on the inside so long,
but this thing smells of suicide.

294
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,828
Can you get us back onto the base?

295
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,808
It's not like the annual pass
to Disneyland.

296
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,144
That was
a very special circumstance.

297
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,800
You don't have to do that.
You've done enough already.

298
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,484
Thank you for getting us Starks' file.
You pulled some strings to do that.

299
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,737
I know. I mean, I wish I could have
turned something up for you guys...

300
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:33,673
- It's a tough break.
- Excuse us... men.

301
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,236
Dude, somebody tampered
with that file.

302
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,460
Captain America
isn't interested in helping.

303
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:46,630
We need to get back on that base...
unsupervised.

304
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,865
And how?

305
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,055
Just go the base
and beg to get back on again?

306
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,594
"Excuse me, officer, can we get back
on the base, please?"

307
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:55,692
Come on, solider,
we're gonna sneak on.

308
00:16:56,572 --> 00:16:57,872
Under the radar.

309
00:16:59,243 --> 00:17:00,543
Under the radar?

310
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,238
Under the radar.

311
00:17:13,123 --> 00:17:16,514
Come on, dude, how was I supposed
to know that they had real radar?

312
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:18,411
Look at the bright side.
We're in a Humvee!

313
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,376
Just what in the hell did you think
you were gonna get away with?

314
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,628
You realize that this kind of idiocy

315
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,545
will not be tolerated on my base!

316
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,590
Is there another type of idiocy
that you would be more comfortable with?

317
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:34,188
Understood.

318
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:36,941
I hope this doesn't affect
Gus and I's chances of enlisting.

319
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,973
Son, I'm not sure what makes either
of you think you're army material.

320
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,608
I have two words for you:

321
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:43,191
army...

322
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:45,838
psychic.

323
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,901
I'm giving you before I pitch it
to CBS as a television idea.

324
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:51,403
We apologize, sir.

325
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,985
- And it will never happen again.
- That's more like it.

326
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,249
For the record, I have the utmost
respect for the united states army,

327
00:17:57,374 --> 00:17:59,119
and all branches of the military.

328
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:02,444
Except, of course, the coast guard.
Did you see <i>The guardian</i>?

329
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:05,458
I'll be contacting your superiors
about this incident.

330
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,920
There will be consequences.

331
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:11,798
- Consequences?
- Consequences!

332
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:15,844
He's gonna come back with a bar of soap
wrapped in a towel!

333
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,555
Would you relax? There's no way
we're getting d'Onofrioed.

334
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,327
You tell him.
It was your psychic revelation.

335
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:34,890
I'm asking you as a favor.

336
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:36,999
As a friend.
Rock, paper, scissors.

337
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:38,691
Two out of three.
Just tell him.

338
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:42,120
Someone start telling me something,
because I'm in the mood to staple heads.

339
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,500
All right, do you have any idea
where Ewan was last night?

340
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,544
Why?

341
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,921
You and I both know
that even Juliet can't tell us 

342
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,082
what Ewan does
for the U.S. government.

343
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,021
And his past is some big secret.

344
00:18:56,146 --> 00:18:58,762
He just breezes in and breezes out
of the army base, and now,

345
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,556
- he's reluctant to get us on?
- In all fairness, he barely knows you.

346
00:19:02,396 --> 00:19:05,183
When we were P.O.Ws,
we saw Ewan outside Felts' office.

347
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:07,312
- What was he doing there?
- For Pete's sake,

348
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,575
if you have something to say,
spit it out. What is on your mind?

349
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:14,152
All right, right now,
it's just a major hunch.

350
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,281
But I think Ewan
is deeply involved in all of this.

351
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,075
You think O'Hara's brother's
a murder?

352
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,039
Maybe.

353
00:19:39,827 --> 00:19:43,139
How dare you accuse
my brother of murder.

354
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,008
Jules, I'm not accusing.

355
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:48,265
At this point
it's just a strong psychic hunch.

356
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,232
Just for the record, you charged both
of my parents with murder on Christmas.

357
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:54,305
That's very true.

358
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,167
Just ask yourself,

359
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,030
what is he doing here?
Why is he in Santa Barbara?

360
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:00,205
That's it?

361
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:02,710
That's your theory,
that he's in town?

362
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,144
Try this theory on for size.

363
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,519
You always argue with your father,
and you rarely even see your mother.

364
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:09,993
Maybe it's just hard for you
to wrap your head around the fact

365
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:13,459
that somebody might have a healthy,
loving relationship with their family.

366
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:15,296
Other than being a war hero,

367
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,799
has my brother done to bring
on your suspicions?

368
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,301
He has an arsenal of weapons
in his pants.

369
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,957
You might just try
to mask your obvious jealousy for Ewan.

370
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:28,432
Jealousy of Ew... What?

371
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:30,227
That's funny.

372
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:33,314
- How funny is that? Laugh a little.
- It's pretty funny.

373
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,412
Because Ewan and I
are basically the same person.

374
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:38,525
It's ridiculous.

375
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,864
Maybe your time would be
better served

376
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,616
if you were to concentrate on real,
viable suspects in our midst.

377
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,112
Like Felts, for example.

378
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:47,981
This guy thinks he's king of the world
because he's got stars on his chest.

379
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:49,914
I've got a badge,
and that guy's going down.

380
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,480
Hello there, detective.

381
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:56,295
Please tell me i'm not going down
before I've had my morning coffee.

382
00:20:57,282 --> 00:21:00,133
Major general,
thank you for coming down.

383
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:02,886
To be honest,
we were just expecting a phone call.

384
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:05,689
Young lady,
we didn't have phones in Nha Trang

385
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:08,474
when I took down nine men
with my bare hands.

386
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:12,870
Perhaps we could talk in private?

387
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:15,038
In here.

388
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:16,661
Go home.

389
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,687
- Major general, you care to sit down?
- Did you know of the 39 men

390
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:32,910
who signed
our declaration of independence,

391
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:34,751
32 of 'em were standing
when they did it.

392
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:37,754
This country was built
from a standing position.

393
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:38,796
I'm good.

394
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:44,218
Thank you for the history lesson.
Now to matters of this century.

395
00:21:44,543 --> 00:21:46,856
This murder isn't going away,
and neither are we.

396
00:21:46,981 --> 00:21:48,295
We want some answers.

397
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,528
I came down here
as a courtesy to you.

398
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,059
But if you're gonna turn this
into an interrogation, detective,

399
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:57,509
you'd better be prepared to stick bamboo
shoots under my fingernails.

400
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:02,135
I didn't think so.

401
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:08,409
I will be back at that base

402
00:22:09,018 --> 00:22:10,218
with warrants!

403
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:11,726
A stack of 'em!

404
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,352
Did you forget how to get home?
'cause we can have an officer take you.

405
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:23,758
We both know
how we can get back on that base.

406
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:24,682
Sorry,

407
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:27,720
you've accused my brother of murder,
and now you want to use him?

408
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,807
We have a stake in this investigation,
so let's investigate.

409
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,825
That is our jobs, remember?

410
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,432
This brother thing is just a hunch.
But I am a psychic,

411
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:37,806
which means I need top be near him
in order to read him.

412
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:39,736
Now, what are you afraid of?

413
00:22:40,872 --> 00:22:42,652
That I can prove I'm right?

414
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:47,345
That's just how you'll prove
that you're wrong.

415
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,748
How many men would you say
you've killed?

416
00:22:56,873 --> 00:22:59,932
Of the four of us, your brother's
the only one who's killed a man,

417
00:23:00,057 --> 00:23:02,839
unless we're counting accidental deaths,
in which case Gus is in the running.

418
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,625
You don't have to defend yourself.

419
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,400
I'm simply wondering...

420
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:08,714
how it feels.

421
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:12,348
I hope you never have to find out.

422
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:15,939
Snap.

423
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:22,102
- I asked for that.
- Yes, you did.

424
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,989
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
not to touch the weapons.

425
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,324
What is this?

426
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:33,786
That is an anti-tank weapon.
And you're pointing it at yourself.

427
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:38,722
You used to work with Starks
in the motorcade, did you not?

428
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:40,626
Yes, I did.
But you know that.

429
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,059
How do you know that?

430
00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:45,548
There's only a certain jobs
a private can be assigned

431
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,301
to on a base like this.
Deductive reasoning.

432
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:50,511


433
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:57,185
Clipboard, please.

434
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:59,842
- Sir?
- Clipboard, please, sir.

435
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:04,984
Starks touched this clipboard.

436
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,529
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do, soldier.

437
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,187
I think you do.

438
00:24:13,157 --> 00:24:14,952
If you have information,
you better tell us.

439
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,333
One of the privates
may have had a girlfriend.

440
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,086
And he may have snuck off the base
that night to see her.

441
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:28,174
And he may have had his pal Starks
sub in for him and man his shift.

442
00:24:28,451 --> 00:24:30,706
Starks normally works
the motor pool,

443
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:33,200
so he knew nothing
about weapon inventory.

444
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:35,924
- Isn't that risky?
- It's pretty simple.

445
00:24:36,264 --> 00:24:39,018
Machine supplies come in,
trucks pick 'em up. Simple.

446
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,321
Starks saw something that night
that he wasn't supposed to.

447
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:45,367
The question is...
What was it?

448
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:51,364
What is the status, Four?

449
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,496
It's a little early for a cocktail,
isn't it?

450
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:55,021
<i>Not on this coast.</i>

451
00:24:55,268 --> 00:24:57,620
Now tell me
you've wrapped this thing up.

452
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,796
I've tried everything
to slow it down.

453
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:02,722
I've turned 'em the wrong way.
I've shredded evidence.

454
00:25:03,716 --> 00:25:06,491
This Shawn Spencer character
is very good at what he does.

455
00:25:06,616 --> 00:25:08,617
Starks was onto something,
and Spencer's close.

456
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:11,676
Are you telling me you can't handle
some local psychic?

457
00:25:12,495 --> 00:25:15,263
I'm gonna follow his lead to the target,
then I'll deal with it. It's perfect.

458
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,742
Okay, Four.
But be in touch.

459
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,425
And in case you weren't sure,
that's an order.

460
00:25:24,932 --> 00:25:28,032
You think you could get Gus and I
back on the base late night?

461
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:29,527
Not a problem.

462
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:37,711
This is nice.

463
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:39,347
Yeah, it is.

464
00:25:40,397 --> 00:25:41,697
Just you and me.

465
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,049
Me and you.

466
00:25:43,992 --> 00:25:46,946
I'm talking about us, man.
I'm talking about this...

467
00:25:47,356 --> 00:25:48,970
Being in a relationship,

468
00:25:49,095 --> 00:25:51,695
spending the time,
spooning it up, it's...

469
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,104
I'm sorry,
do you have somewhere to be?

470
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:08,941
That's ridiculous.

471
00:26:09,926 --> 00:26:11,693
I would never do that.
Why would I...

472
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:16,319
I'm sorry.

473
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,444
I had every intention of making this
an amazing date.

474
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:22,580
I did. I just... I have to work.

475
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:25,917
Maybe if I had a normal job
with regular hours,

476
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,419
- like you do...
- You're missing the point.

477
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,947
- I'm not totally available to you.
- Listen to me...

478
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:32,975
There are things that I have to do,

479
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,199
because I have to do them,
and they don't involve our relationship.

480
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:37,888
I'm going to Uganda!

481
00:26:39,435 --> 00:26:40,435
The city?

482
00:26:41,264 --> 00:26:42,350
It's a country.

483
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:44,113
I knew that.

484
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,390
Tell me you're not having an affair
with Kamala.

485
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,203
Kamala the wrestler?

486
00:26:50,328 --> 00:26:52,735
His real name is Jim Harris,

487
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,988
and he's not from Uganda,
he's from Mississippi.

488
00:26:56,721 --> 00:26:58,115
God, I love that you know that.

489
00:27:00,643 --> 00:27:01,643
All right.

490
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:06,373
- When do you leave?
- Two days.

491
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:09,961
- How long?
- Six months.

492
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,960
Maybe longer.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

493
00:27:14,085 --> 00:27:17,506
It all just happened really fast.
It's this amazing program, all right.

494
00:27:17,631 --> 00:27:19,178
It's called "one kid one world."

495
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:21,607
I'm gonna be helping to build
and design this school,

496
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:24,100
and I'm gonna teach kids
who are just desperate to learn.

497
00:27:24,384 --> 00:27:26,539
- It sounds nice.
- That's why I've been pressuring you

498
00:27:26,664 --> 00:27:29,017
- to get together, so I could tell you.
- Really?

499
00:27:29,142 --> 00:27:31,899
You couldn't have slipped it in anywhere
before right now, this second?

500
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,606
I thought about it
right after the coroner

501
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:36,696
pulled the dog tags out
of that guy's mouth.

502
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,900
Come on.

503
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:41,325
Have the conversation that we would
have had if I had told you.

504
00:27:41,668 --> 00:27:43,467
Fine, I would have asked you
not to go.

505
00:27:43,592 --> 00:27:45,345
I would say that
that is completely unfair

506
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,873
because I've been waiting
for this opportunity for six years.

507
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,932
And I'd ask you to come with me.

508
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:56,299
I would say that's not very fair.
Because Psych is here and Gus is here.

509
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,897
And what am I supposed to do
in Uganda for six months or longer?

510
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,590
Where does that leave us, then?

511
00:28:11,346 --> 00:28:13,124
Now, that's a fair question.

512
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:24,832
- Okay, it's the last one.
- Got it, sarge.

513
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:30,196
Thanks for scoring us
these dope army costumes.

514
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,673
They're not costumes.
They're government-issue uniforms.

515
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,211
I wonder where that truck is going.

516
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,026
Any chance it's Uganda?

517
00:28:38,603 --> 00:28:39,884
Shawn, are you okay?

518
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:43,052
Thanks, buddy.

519
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,665
There's only one way to find out.
We gotta get on that truck.

520
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,546
Ewan, how would you normally handle
a situation like this?

521
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:49,560
Take 'em out.

522
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:52,855
A little elaborate.
Somewhat unorthodox.

523
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:54,439
But possibly genius.

524
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:57,360
Do we still have the number for that guy
who can get us tickets for Raw?

525
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:59,820
Kirano.
But that's not what he meant.

526
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:02,947
Wait a minute,
you mean you would kill them?

527
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:04,669
Not right away.

528
00:29:04,794 --> 00:29:06,858
But usually
I'm dealing with the enemy.

529
00:29:06,983 --> 00:29:09,372
These guys are on our side.
What do you guys do?

530
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,697
It's called creating a diversion.

531
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,809
How does that work?

532
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,385
What are you doing out
of your barracks after lights out, son?

533
00:29:24,447 --> 00:29:25,930
I was just taking a stroll.

534
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,399
Taking a stroll?

535
00:29:28,112 --> 00:29:31,059
What are you, soldier,
some kind of dandy?

536
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:34,063
- Get down on the ground.
- I'm sorry?

537
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:35,782
Hit the deck, maggot!

538
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,226
All right, you start giving me push-ups,
and I mean good ones,

539
00:29:40,351 --> 00:29:42,822
all the way up and all the way down,
or you will start over.

540
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,781
Start!

541
00:29:44,777 --> 00:29:46,409
- You miss your mommy yet?
- I do,

542
00:29:46,754 --> 00:29:48,451
- I guess.
- You guess?

543
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,703
You have a girly
you write to back home?

544
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:52,873
No, but I gave that
a thought lately.

545
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:56,000
You think I want to hear a monologue
about your feelings?

546
00:29:56,245 --> 00:29:58,295
- No... no, sir.
- Keep going!

547
00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:01,549
- Do you even want to be here?
- I don't know.

548
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,042
- I'm not too sure.
- Not too sure?

549
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:05,970
I will ask you again.

550
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:09,306
- Do you want to be here?
- I do, sir!

551
00:30:10,565 --> 00:30:13,215
- Why is that, private?
- I got nowhere else to go!

552
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:15,688
I got nowhere else to...

553
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:17,846
Pathetic!

554
00:30:19,437 --> 00:30:22,087
Sergeant Powell
keeps sending me you guys!

555
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:35,269
Nice, buddy.

556
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:38,102
You were totally doing lines
from an officer and a gentleman.

557
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:41,085
I don't know where it came from.
Lou Gossett was like my pretend dad

558
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,560
after that movie.

559
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,301
I felt the same way
after <i>Enemy Mine</i>.

560
00:30:57,603 --> 00:30:58,603
Over here.

561
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:15,664
It's Wallach?

562
00:31:16,077 --> 00:31:18,014
He had his own operation
selling weapons.

563
00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:20,016
This must be what Starks saw.

564
00:31:20,141 --> 00:31:22,644
He had a conscience.
He didn't blindly follow, he questioned,

565
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:25,965
- and he reported it to Wallach.
- But he was the wrong person to tell.

566
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,176
Wallach killed him
in that motel room.

567
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,227
And... don't be offended
by this, but...

568
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:40,855
I thought it was you
who was somehow behind all this.

569
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,696
I've never met a man who's so big
he couldn't hide behind a plane.

570
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,875
We need to make a plan.

571
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,045
Stay here!

572
00:32:46,374 --> 00:32:47,256
Let's go!

573
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:48,641
You said to stay here.

574
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,075
- "Stay here." That's what you said!
- You can move now.

575
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,969
Let's go.

576
00:32:54,477 --> 00:32:55,306
Come on!

577
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:08,937
Wallach sees us from a distance,
breaks into a crate,

578
00:33:09,062 --> 00:33:11,092
pulls out a gonna-36, and he's gone.

579
00:33:11,217 --> 00:33:14,417
We might have had a chance,
but it's all speculation.

580
00:33:16,348 --> 00:33:17,898
I owe you an apology.

581
00:33:18,158 --> 00:33:19,121
I was wrong.

582
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:20,873
For accusing my brother?

583
00:33:21,495 --> 00:33:23,854
No, I was gonna say you were right.
I looked it up...

584
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:26,003
Eve Plumb did do 3 episodes
of <i>The Love Boat</i>,

585
00:33:26,288 --> 00:33:28,222
playing 3 different characters.

586
00:33:28,347 --> 00:33:31,160
Turns out she has a lot more range
than I gave her credit for.

587
00:33:32,536 --> 00:33:34,436
Now that I'm thinking of it,

588
00:33:34,632 --> 00:33:37,268
I was also wrong
to accuse your brother.

589
00:33:38,536 --> 00:33:41,536
He saved our lives and,
well, I owe him for that.

590
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,101
- That is very sweet.
- Yes, it is.

591
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:47,190
What's more, I really mean it.

592
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:48,713
I'm sure you do.

593
00:33:49,226 --> 00:33:51,376
But it's not that easy this time.

594
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,073
Listen up!

595
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:59,292
At ease. At this moment,
and against my better judgment,

596
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:03,099
I'm gonna overlook the blatant disregard
for the rules of the US army,

597
00:34:03,224 --> 00:34:06,251
and say thank you to Shawn Spencer
and his partner...

598
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:09,064
Ghee Buttersnaps,

599
00:34:09,189 --> 00:34:12,107
for their efforts to uncover
Wallach's criminal misconduct.

600
00:34:12,232 --> 00:34:15,091
We have identified the missing weapons
and are now tracking them.

601
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,262
And to one of our own, Ewan O'Hara,

602
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:21,026
for his heroic actions
in this albeit unauthorized operation.

603
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:24,758
We have a man on the run.
We're gonna find him.

604
00:34:25,546 --> 00:34:28,148
So here are the parameters
for "operation manhunt".

605
00:34:28,486 --> 00:34:30,359
Excuse me, Major General, sir.

606
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:33,319
Are you open to suggestions for
alternate names to "operation manhunt"?

607
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,860
It seems a little on the nose, sir.

608
00:34:37,112 --> 00:34:39,493
First order of business,
we're gonna do a lockdown of the base.

609
00:34:40,172 --> 00:34:41,737
No one gets in, no one gets out.

610
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:43,774
Then I want an inventory done

611
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,151
of all the arms rooms
on the installation.

612
00:34:49,015 --> 00:34:50,838
Look, man, I don't know what...

613
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:53,657
the rules are
for saving lives these days,

614
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:57,636
but I want you to know that
if you ever need anything xeroxed

615
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,847
or mimeographed or alphabetized,

616
00:35:00,972 --> 00:35:01,932
Gus is your man.

617
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,180
Not necessary.
I'm just glad you guys are okay.

618
00:35:04,305 --> 00:35:07,211
Listen, I'm sorry I couldn't be there
to help you net Wallach,

619
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:10,649
but I'm sure you guys will do it.
Army has a way of weeding out bad seeds.

620
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:12,118
Are you leaving?

621
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:14,165
Yeah, I got a flight, 0430.

622
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:17,238
Wouldn't happen to be to Uganda,
would it?

623
00:35:19,058 --> 00:35:20,594
You know, It's funny...

624
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,495
that Major General Felts
turned out to be the good guy.

625
00:35:24,941 --> 00:35:26,865
If I hadn't seen great Santiniso
many times

626
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,541
I would have seen that sooner.

627
00:35:28,808 --> 00:35:29,808
Duvall.

628
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,249
Yeah, Duvall.

629
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,081
If Starks didn't die,

630
00:35:34,206 --> 00:35:36,055
he would have had
that appointment with Felts,

631
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,019
and Felts would have figured out
this whole weapons thing a lot sooner.

632
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:42,066
Man...

633
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:46,814
<i>Ewan, you don't have to do that.
You've already done enough.</i>

634
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:49,897
<i>And thanks for Starks' file.
I know you had to pull some strings.</i>

635
00:35:50,693 --> 00:35:53,190
<i>I wish we could have turned
something for you.</i>

636
00:35:53,315 --> 00:35:54,415
<i>Tough break.</i>

637
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,612
<i>It just smells like suicide.</i>

638
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,513
<i>You used to work with Starks.</i>

639
00:35:59,638 --> 00:36:01,283
<i>Yes, I did. But you know that.</i>

640
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:02,993
<i>How do you know that?</i>

641
00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:11,668
- Dude, where's Ewan?
- He left.

642
00:36:12,818 --> 00:36:14,046
My God, I was wrong.

643
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:17,173
I mean I was right.
I was right, and then wrong.

644
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:19,426
- Now I'm right again.
- You're not making any sense.

645
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:23,576
We have to follow Ewan. He's up
to something. I'll explain on the way.

646
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:29,435
Where are those guys going?

647
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,124
- Let's call Lassiter.
- No time for that. We gotta get down.

648
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,649
I got all the time.
I'd like to live.

649
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,019
All this time I thought you were trying
to help us uncover the truth.

650
00:36:59,144 --> 00:37:02,927
But really you were trying to slow us
down so that you could get to him first.

651
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:05,497
- We each have our job.
- Yes, we do.

652
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,667
I've had many jobs.
I'm not sure

653
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,183
which one you're referring to.

654
00:37:09,456 --> 00:37:11,270
My guess is that it's not

655
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:13,405
my brief stint
as a lobbyist for M&Ms,

656
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,606
trying to get them to bring back
the light brown ones.

657
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:18,924
But let's not get caught up
in one another's achievements.

658
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:21,071
Suffice to say we both
have very impressive resumes.

659
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:22,986
Let's just talk...

660
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,325
Man to...

661
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:28,004
much smaller, less fit man.

662
00:37:28,555 --> 00:37:31,086
All right,
Wallach here broke an army code.

663
00:37:32,026 --> 00:37:33,813
A code based on allegiance,

664
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:35,045
honor,

665
00:37:35,692 --> 00:37:36,502
honesty.

666
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,214
How'bout this, Ewan...
How'bout I bring the cops in here?

667
00:37:39,339 --> 00:37:42,091
And we arrest this guy,
slap some cuffs on him.

668
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,518
How satisfying will that be to watch?
I'll make sure

669
00:37:44,643 --> 00:37:47,756
Lassie makes 'em tight
so that they chafe and they flake.

670
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,851
You know you sister will get the collar.
That's a bonus.

671
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,187
I'm not taking Wallach anywhere.

672
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,718
- Wait a second. You gonna kill him?
- Yes, Gus.

673
00:37:56,843 --> 00:37:59,283
I believe that's what the cocking
of the gun was meant to mean.

674
00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:01,819
You wouldn't be this lost
if you would come closer.

675
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:05,198
You know how I feel about piers.
They are covered in pelican urine.

676
00:38:05,954 --> 00:38:08,827
Everything you touched is soaked in it.
I'm good where I am.

677
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:12,897
You're a good detective.
You've got a good thing going here.

678
00:38:13,284 --> 00:38:15,374
On top of that,
my sister likes you and so do I.

679
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:18,003
But we all have orders.

680
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:20,600
And I'm still alive
because I follow mine.

681
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:22,267
Why don't you and your buddy...

682
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,216
Seriously? The name is Gus!

683
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,533
Turn around, walk out.

684
00:38:29,293 --> 00:38:30,641
Forget you ever saw me.

685
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:34,315
Go have a drink.
Toast to a job well done.

686
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:36,689
Leave me to do what I have to do.

687
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:38,814
We can live with that, can't we?

688
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,541
I can't.

689
00:38:43,543 --> 00:38:44,543
Easy, little sis.

690
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,940
Drop it, Ewan.

691
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,527
We both know you're not
gonna shoot your older brother.

692
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:52,777
No, but I will.

693
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:57,834
I could make this very complicated
for you right now.

694
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,870
What is this even about?

695
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:04,090
You're protecting the army
from some bad publicity?

696
00:39:06,122 --> 00:39:08,052
What happened to the Ewan I knew?

697
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:12,698
You know you're the reason
I became a cop?

698
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:16,274
You gave me the confidence
to go for it, and I did.

699
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:18,177
I became one.

700
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:20,816
And now I have a job to do
and that is to uphold the law.

701
00:39:20,988 --> 00:39:22,738
And no one is above that.

702
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:26,446
Wallach is gonna go to jail
for what he did, and so are you.

703
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:33,792
You are under arrest

704
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:37,746
for the attempted murder of lieutenant
W. Wallach of the united states army.

705
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,056
You have the right to remain silent.

706
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:45,131
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

707
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,070
For the record,
I really hate that I was right.

708
00:40:08,562 --> 00:40:09,566
Me too.

709
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,118
This must be hard for you.

710
00:40:21,243 --> 00:40:24,128
I mean, I have family members
I would love to see go to prison,

711
00:40:25,075 --> 00:40:26,246
but this must be tough.

712
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:27,721
He broke the law.

713
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,118
That's all there is to it for me.

714
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:35,640
Excuse me, I'm looking for a prisoner...
Ewan O'Hara?

715
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:41,313
Sorry, he's not here.

716
00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:43,564
Is he on a different bus?

717
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:46,025
No, ma'am,
there's no record of a Ewan O'Hara.

718
00:40:54,393 --> 00:40:56,318
<i>Now boarding from 665...</i>

719
00:40:56,443 --> 00:40:58,941
Are you sure
you don't want to come visit?

720
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:01,957
Maybe. I mean it's...
It's not out of the question.

721
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,958
It's the hole in the ground
as a toilet thing

722
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,754
that's giving me pause.

723
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:09,323
I won't even tell you
about the whole toiletpaper situation.

724
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,304
I'll be thinking about you, though.

725
00:41:17,153 --> 00:41:19,184
I think we'll both be doing
our share of that.

726
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,232
Tell me one more time
exactly when you get back.

727
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:30,459
Right, I'll be back for a little bit
on February 24th, so...

728
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,656
24th, got it.
I'm going to circle it on my calendar.

729
00:41:40,036 --> 00:41:44,036
<i>Now boarding flight 665
to LAX with international connections.</i>

730
00:41:44,598 --> 00:41:47,999
<i>Now boarding flight 665
to Los Angeles international airport.</i>

731
00:41:54,475 --> 00:41:55,725
Ticket, please.
