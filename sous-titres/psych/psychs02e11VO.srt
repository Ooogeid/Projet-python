1
00:00:02,354 --> 00:00:03,755
Come on, boys. Sit up, sit up.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,958
Come on, napkins in lap.

3
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:07,387
Now, listen,
we don't get to go out very often,

4
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:09,277
so I want you to order
something special.

5
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:12,385
Harbor grill is one of the
Nicest restaurants in Santa Barbara.

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,001
I'm gonna have nachos.

7
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:15,962
No way.

8
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:18,971
Dad, I think that guy
over there is a spy.

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,579
And he's trying to poison her!

10
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:33,680
I don't know how to say this,
so I'm just gonna say it.

11
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:34,991
Megan,

12
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:36,490
will you marry me?

13
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:39,727
Y, yes.

14
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:41,538
Of course, yes!

15
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:47,382
Come on, guys,
you've seen people propose before.

16
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:48,899
It's a very special moment.

17
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:50,025
Especially for a man.

18
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:51,851
You fall in love with a woman.

19
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:54,156
You decide you're gonna spend
the rest of your life with her.

20
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:55,901
Rest of my life with a girl?

21
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:59,158
- No way!
- I'm never ever gonna get married!

22
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:06,592
By the way,
they're not gonna make it.

23
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:15,434
Do I need to set this on slow pitch?

24
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:17,982
Hey.

25
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:19,821
I swore I saw that guy earlier.

26
00:01:19,961 --> 00:01:21,853
Yeah, He's been following us all day.

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,226
I'd say worst P.I, Ever.

28
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:26,023
Check this out.

29
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,306
What the,
no,

30
00:01:33,546 --> 00:01:35,166
he followed me into the bathroom?

31
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:36,507
That's my sanctuary.

32
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:37,807
- I know.
- All right,

33
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:39,613
we gotta find out what he wants.

34
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,218
And we have to do it in a way
that's cool and clever.

35
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:43,839
I got it.

36
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:51,999
Gyro ball!

37
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:53,419
Hey, watch it!

38
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,969
Let me show you how it's done.

39
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,175
Watch out.

40
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:09,561
That very well may be the most
humiliating moment of your life.

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,184
I pitch better from the stretch.

42
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:20,459
That's enough.

43
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,521
Hey.

44
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:28,301
And that was for following
me into the bathroom.

45
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:30,292
Okay, so you figured
out I was following you.

46
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:32,371
My name is Mace Rhoden.
I'm a private investigator.

47
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,990
If, I might give you a little criticism,

48
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,080
I don't think you've quite
mastered the private part.

49
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,536
Of course, if you're going
for most obvious detective...

50
00:02:40,605 --> 00:02:43,113
- nailed it.
- What do you want from us?

51
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:45,190
I was hired to find you...
by your wife.

52
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:48,885
One more tiny piece of criticism.

53
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,621
You haven't mastered
the investigative part either.

54
00:02:51,698 --> 00:02:52,984
Neither of us are married.

55
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:55,553
Shawn, an I talk to you for a minute?

56
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:58,202
This guy!

57
00:02:58,242 --> 00:03:01,707
Talkin' about one of us being married.
Can you even imagine that?

58
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:04,963
Why aren't you laughing?

59
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,490
Why aren't you laughing?

60
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:12,170
Oh, my god!

61
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:14,103
You were married?

62
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:21,563

Transcript : www.swsub.com [V1.01]

68
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:39,704
I can't believe you were married!

69
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:41,641
Bachelor party is tainted.

70
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:44,047
I didn't get to give my brilliant speech
I've been planning

71
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:46,695
- since we were seventh graders.
- You have not.

72
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,912
- You have a book of speeches?
- I wrote those a long time ago.

73
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:54,690
You already wrote my eulogy?

74
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,267
I don't remember that.

75
00:03:56,282 --> 00:04:00,575
"Gus is survived by his best
friend Shawn Spencer and 12 cats."

76
00:04:00,912 --> 00:04:02,737
Look, the speeches
are not the point, Gus.

77
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:05,315
The point is,
why didn't you tell me you were married?

78
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:07,445
I didn't tell anyone. I was embarrassed.

79
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:09,005
Look, I'm sorry.

80
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:10,508
I was wrong for not telling you.

81
00:04:10,603 --> 00:04:13,694
But, dude, you know when I get married
for real you'll be standing up there

82
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,475
on that altar, right next to me,
as my best man.

83
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:18,677
Thank you for saying that.

84
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:20,058
I need to hear it.

85
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:21,288
You're welcome.

86
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:23,424
So who is this Harlot?

87
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:25,966
It was spring break '97.

88
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:28,837
I was in Mazatlan with
some college friends.

89
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,027
'97?

90
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:33,538
Tell me you weren't still
rockin' the sweater vest.

91
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:35,362
What?
No.

92
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:38,292
Her name was Mira Gaffney.

93
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,024
<i>I'll never forget
the first time I saw her.</i>

94
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,363
<i>Mira was like no other girl
I ever dated.</i>

95
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,252
<i>She could get me to do things
no one else could ever do.</i>

96
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:07,699
So seriously?

97
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:10,369
You've never been skydiving?

98
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,391
Well, I really don't like planes.

99
00:05:12,474 --> 00:05:13,591
Or heights.

100
00:05:13,655 --> 00:05:14,667
Or Jumpsuits.

101
00:05:15,237 --> 00:05:17,475
No, you like sweater vests.

102
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:19,096
I do.

103
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:21,660
So you're a skydiving virgin?

104
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:23,824
Yeah!

105
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:27,727
I'm gonna take you! We'll go!
It's amazing! You're gonna love it!

106
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:30,930
<i>Okay. Dude, skydiving's one thing,
but how did she get you to marry her?</i>

107
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:32,078
<i>Three words.</i>

108
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:33,898
<i>Three little words.</i>

109
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:36,316
Let's try goldschlager!

110
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,175
<i>And four hours later...</i>

111
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:45,150
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

112
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,285
And your best man was a goat?

113
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:49,211
I was supposed to be that goat!

114
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:51,059
Shawn, we're on me now.

115
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:53,916
You're right. I'm, I'm sorry.

116
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,742
Man,

117
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:57,671
I haven't thought about her in so long.

118
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:01,331
People used to call her hurricane
Mira because she was this wild,

119
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:02,920
beautiful, insane girl.

120
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:05,044
So who broke it off?

121
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:06,060
Me.

122
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,565
And it got weird real quick.

123
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,584
She called me,
like, 100 times in one day.

124
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:11,479
And threatened to burn down
my apartment.

125
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:13,896
Mira really has a thing for fire?

126
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,201
But there's something about her.
It just stuck with me.

127
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:18,397
I have never felt that
way about any other woman.

128
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,418
All right, that's it.
I need to meet this trollop.

129
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:21,670
You wanna come with me?

130
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,944
Yeah!

131
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:27,262
You bet but, dude, listen, I don't
know if I can control myself around her,

132
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:29,018
so you have to promise that you'll stop

133
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:31,084
me from being sucked
into hurricane Mira again.

134
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,670
Just call me the suck-stopper.

135
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,300
Scratch that.
Don't, don't ever call me that.

136
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,633
I wonder why she wants to see me.

137
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:40,189
I don't know.

138
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:43,864
Maybe she wants to introduce
you to little Gus junior.

139
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:46,263
Or not.

140
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:54,623
Hold it!
S. b.p.d.!

141
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:56,310
I said stop!

142
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:58,112
Hold it!

143
00:06:58,734 --> 00:06:59,755
Look out!

144
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,004
Son of a...

145
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:08,993
I said freeze, you. S.B.P.D.!

146
00:07:13,994 --> 00:07:15,949
You have the right to remain silent.

147
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:19,253
- O'hara, how did you just.
- Just had a hunch he lived in the area.

148
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:20,922
I figured he'd try to lose us by hopping

149
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:24,054
one of the fences between hope street
and the 101. Let's go.

150
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:29,810
I'm impressed.

151
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:31,758
Shut up.

152
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:35,412
Come on, O'hara, level with me.
That was really just a hunch?

153
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,540
Yes, for the tenth time.

154
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:40,722
Did he, like, drop his wallet or
a piece of mail with his address on it?

155
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:42,566
Have you been to his house before?

156
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:44,280
Why would I have been to his house?

157
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:45,546
I don't know.
You date.

158
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,272
I just happen to be
good at deductive reasoning.

159
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:50,295
You know, I've been studying
for the detective's exam,

160
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,516
and the deductive reasoning
part is just killing me.

161
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:55,395
- Maybe you could tutor me some time?
- Sure. Okay.

162
00:07:55,677 --> 00:07:58,524
You know, if anyone's gonna tutor
you, it should be me. After I do

163
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:01,877
hold the department record for the
highest score on the detective's exam.

164
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,642
97.2.

165
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:08,249
What?

166
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:13,493
I have to go wash out the, drunk tank.

167
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:14,864
Yeah!

168
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:18,987
What, did
someone beat my score?

169
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:21,867
Hey. I heard about the collar.

170
00:08:21,882 --> 00:08:23,537
Nice work. Another case closed.

171
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:24,563
- Chief.
- Yeah?

172
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:27,009
Did someone score higher
than me on the detective's exam?

173
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:28,511
I believe O'hara did.

174
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,891
O'hara?

175
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:34,351
You beat my score?

176
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:36,134
Only by a little.

177
00:08:36,257 --> 00:08:37,376
How much?

178
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:38,987
98.4.

179
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:42,931
Gosh, you know, I check all
those scores every three months.

180
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:44,457
How come I didn't know about this?

181
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:46,703
Well, because I made
detective when I was in Miami.

182
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:49,126
So you wouldn't see those results.

183
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:52,945
And I didn't wanna tell you because
I know how much you hate to lose.

184
00:08:52,993 --> 00:08:54,380
I do not hate to lose.

185
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:56,684
Look, we both did well on the exam.

186
00:08:56,699 --> 00:08:58,882
And those scores don't matter to me.

187
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,896
What matters to me is that
I respect you as a cop and as a friend,

188
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:07,381
and I really, really hope this
doesn't become a thing between us.

189
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,367
This is not gonna become
a thing between us.

190
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,335
That Mace guy said this
was the place to meet her.

191
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,465
Maybe she works here.

192
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,005
That wouldn't surprise me.
She's had, like, a thousand jobs.

193
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,440
There's nothing wrong with that.

194
00:09:23,705 --> 00:09:25,204
And she doesn't just work here.

195
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:26,458
The wine is named Mira.

196
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:28,944
Maybe they name a wine
after all their employees.

197
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:31,610
Remind me to grab a bottle
of Leonard on the way out.

198
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:33,701
Burton Guster?

199
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:41,348
Gus.

200
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,377
Gus.

201
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:45,494
Gus!

202
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,426
What do I say?
How's my breath?

203
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:49,456
Relax. Remember the plan.

204
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,562
What plan?

205
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:52,116
I forgot the plan.

206
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:58,084
How are you?
I haven't seen you in what?

207
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,872
Ten years?
And now look, boom, here you are.

208
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:04,411
Hi, I'm Shawn.

209
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:05,611
Hi.

210
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,236
I, I gave him a really tough riddle
on the way over,

211
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:13,276
so he's probably now just figuring out
that the doctor was a woman.

212
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:14,585
No, no.

213
00:10:14,736 --> 00:10:16,869
He's done this before.
He did this when we first met.

214
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:20,206
I think it's kinda cute actually.
If we just keep talking, he'll catch up.

215
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:23,049
So I hear that you guys have
a detective agency or something.

216
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:24,274
Mira!

217
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,481
Mira!

218
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:26,824
Hi.

219
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,050
Hi there.

220
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:29,175
Welcome.

221
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,110
You look amazing.

222
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:32,223
No, you do.

223
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,375
- No, you really look amazing.
- No, you do.

224
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:35,853
A little bit, but, I mean!

225
00:10:35,898 --> 00:10:38,335
The only thing that would have been
better was if you had worn one

226
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,457
of those sweater vests. I love it,
do you still wear those sweater vests?

227
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:43,976
Gus, I rember the plan.
This isn't it.

228
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:47,067
I know. Let's celebrate with a drink.
Okay?

229
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:49,389
But not goldschlager, right?

230
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:52,313
- I'm in trouble.
- l right, just be cool.

231
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:54,101
And make your armpits stop sweating.

232
00:10:54,627 --> 00:10:58,554
Okay, so this is our sangiovese
from last year.

233
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:01,605
Goldschlager!

234
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,625
Gus.

235
00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:06,675
So how long have you been working here?

236
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,240
No, no, no. This is my family's place.
We have three wineries.

237
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:12,947
This one, a new one in Napa,
and then there's the one in Spain,

238
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:16,214
which of course I can't go to
because I punched the bull in Pamplona.

239
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:17,232
So, Mira,

240
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:20,052
what made you wanna see
me after all this time?

241
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:21,109
Well,

242
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:23,945
I kinda have some big news.

243
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:25,896
Is it Gus junior?

244
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:28,238
- What?
- Nothing.

245
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,316
I'm getting married.

246
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,682
Yeah, yeah.
His name is Jann, and he's from sweden.

247
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,552
Although he's lived all over the world.

248
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:41,345
And I met him at this wine
convention a few months ago.

249
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,358
Mira, that's awesome. Congratulations.

250
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:44,465
Thanks.

251
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,449
So the thing is, Gus, that,
our wedding chapel in Mazatlan,

252
00:11:49,464 --> 00:11:52,920
they actually sent the marriage license
to the U.S the annulment isn't official.

253
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:55,686
So I kinda just need you to
fill out some paperwork. Is that cool?

254
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:57,904
- Yes.
- Sure.

255
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,039
- Yes.
- Okay, sure.

256
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:01,430
Good. I was a little worried.

257
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:03,977
So when is the big day?

258
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:05,417
It's actually tomorrow.

259
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:08,513
On ledbetter beach.
It's just gonna be a small thing.

260
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,814
I kinda wanted it to be here,
but he wanted at a beach.

261
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:13,373
It's really the only thing he really
wants, so I think I'll let him do it.

262
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:15,204
It's kinda romantic. And, dad!

263
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:17,007
Yeah?

264
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,311
Dad, this is Shawn.
It's Shawn, right? Yeah, Shawn.

265
00:12:20,326 --> 00:12:22,174
And this is Gus.

266
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:25,158
Yes, Guster.

267
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:27,821
So this is the young man that
tricked you into marrying him?

268
00:12:27,844 --> 00:12:28,895
Yeah.

269
00:12:29,027 --> 00:12:30,030
Typical.

270
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,876
Mira, I need to speak to you.

271
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:33,015
- Okay.
- Gentlemen.

272
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,791
Only the first gLass is free.

273
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:40,695
- Why don't you come to the wedding?
- Mira.

274
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:45,329
Please, please, please, please!
Come, come, come, come, come, come!

275
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,165
Very sweet of you,
but we're a little tight.

276
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,887
- What time should we be there?
- Gus.

277
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:50,497
Shawn, what is wrong with you?

278
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,186
Mira, of course we will come.

279
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,372
Okay, good.

280
00:12:53,764 --> 00:12:56,703
So I'm gonna go get the wedding
info and the annulment papers.

281
00:12:56,905 --> 00:12:59,104
I hope I don't ever say
that sentence again.

282
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,963
Dude.

283
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:02,847
She just smelled so nice.

284
00:13:03,588 --> 00:13:04,790
Don't judge me, Shawn.

285
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:05,899
I'm weak.

286
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:09,615
I can't believe late.

287
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,479
Look,
I'm not the one that spent two hours

288
00:13:11,518 --> 00:13:14,359
picking out the perfect
shirt-tie-eyes combo.

289
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,700
<i>Finally, what the hell am I doing here?</i>

290
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,905
Shawn, you cancelled twice. You're late.

291
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,747
- I'm hungry.
- Look, we're gonna eat lunch.

292
00:13:20,762 --> 00:13:23,790
I promise. There may even be a grilled
cheese bar and some dancing involved.

293
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:26,337
- What the crab shack?
- Change plans. We're going to wedding.

294
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:28,427
I can't go to a wedding.
I'm not dressed for wedding.

295
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:30,687
Dad, you look sharp as a tack.
No one will even notice.

296
00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:31,738
Shawn.

297
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,294
Shawn.

298
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,182
- Hi.
- Hi.

299
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:42,227
I'm Stacy.
I'm Mira's friend.

300
00:13:43,786 --> 00:13:45,534
- Is he with you?
- Yeah he's fine.

301
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:46,738
I just won him in a bet.

302
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:50,604
- I know whoyouare.
- You do?

303
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:52,394
You're Gus.

304
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:53,537
Gus!

305
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:57,214
We've been waiting for you. Mira said
we couldn't start until you got here.

306
00:13:57,229 --> 00:13:59,199
After all, you are a very special guest.

307
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:00,330
I am?

308
00:14:00,696 --> 00:14:03,787
Don't be nervous, you.
You'll do great.

309
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:05,690
Your spot's just right up front there.

310
00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:06,714
Lucky.

311
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,270
Now get up there!

312
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:09,331
Okay.

313
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:10,932
Little tie.

314
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:12,896
He's here!

315
00:14:23,984 --> 00:14:25,449
Oh, my god.

316
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:27,321
This is my wedding.

317
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:29,291
- Gus, that's crazy.
- No, it's not.

318
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:33,336
It's Mira. It's just like her to try
to pull something like this.

319
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,365
- You gotta get me outta here.
- Okay, relax.

320
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:37,583
I can have Mexico in four hours.

321
00:14:37,598 --> 00:14:39,517
But we gotta dye your hair change
your name cut off your

322
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:42,304
- fingertips so you can't be identified.
- I don't need fingertips.

323
00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:45,376
Excuse me, everyone.
I'm afraid we have horrible news.

324
00:14:46,873 --> 00:14:48,686
It seems Jann is missing.

325
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:49,945
Yes!

326
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:52,470
That was close!
Sweet!

327
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:01,572
Sweetie pie.

328
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:02,619
It's...

329
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,628
No, I don't want the water.

330
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:07,279
Baby, it's been two hours.

331
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,809
I don't think he's coming.

332
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,257
Of course he's not coming.

333
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:11,763
Didn't show up wednesday for golf,

334
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,361
thursday for the barbeque,
yesterday for the rehearsal dinner.

335
00:15:14,376 --> 00:15:16,024
Why would he show up to his own wedding?

336
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:19,059
No, dad, you know that he got
called to work on those other things.

337
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:21,172
I can't believe you talked me into this.

338
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:23,505
Baby, can we at least
let the people eat something?

339
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,684
No.

340
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,560
Nobody gets to eat until I'm married!

341
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:33,507
That's it, Shawn.

342
00:15:33,522 --> 00:15:34,523
I'm outta here.

343
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:37,461
It's rude to invite people
to an event and not feed 'em.

344
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:39,683
Somebody fix it!

345
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:41,950
Look at her in that dress.

346
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:43,909
She's so beautiful.

347
00:15:44,906 --> 00:15:46,488
Dude, I gotta get you outta here.

348
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:50,191
This must be how she felt
after I annulled our wedding.

349
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:51,392
I feel so bad for her.

350
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:53,324
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, let's hit it.

351
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:55,138
What?

352
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:57,940
- Mira.
- Yeah?

353
00:15:58,176 --> 00:16:00,083
I am so sorry to hear about Jann.

354
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:01,609
We'll help you find him.

355
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,953
- You will?
- We will?

356
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:05,995
Yes, we don't have any cases right now.
We're more than happy to help.

357
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:07,939
Guster!

358
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,576
Thank you.

359
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,548
Just finished my case
reports for the week,

360
00:16:12,563 --> 00:16:14,814
spell-checked, copied,
and collated, time to spare.

361
00:16:15,155 --> 00:16:16,187
Good for you.

362
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,480
Exactly. O'hara, I do hope you're not
falling behind on your paperwork.

363
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:22,160
Those reports look great, O'hara.

364
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:24,978
Listen, can you translate
these files into Spanish?

365
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:26,540
No problema.

366
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:27,918
You speak Spanish?

367
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:29,586
It's a requirement in Miami.

368
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:34,732
Well, there's not that very large a
Latino population here in Santa Barbara.

369
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,602
That's so hot! Matt!

370
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,264
Did you just brew this?

371
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:49,359
It's not too hot for me.

372
00:16:49,662 --> 00:16:51,940
Please tell me you didn't
just burn your mouth because

373
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:54,819
you're still pissed I scored
higher than you on that stupid exam?

374
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:56,297
No.

375
00:16:56,969 --> 00:16:58,238
Hey, detective O'hara!

376
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:01,527
Your stolen refrigeration truck from
the seafood warehouse, that's a

377
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,986
10-8-51, right?

378
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:04,400
- Yes.
- No, hold on.

379
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:08,050
That truck is a commercial vehicle,
so technically it's a 15-250.

380
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:10,086
Excuse me, detective. He was asking me.

381
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:14,877
Now, if that vehicle ends
up in a chop shop, it's a 10-8-03.

382
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:17,436
Of course if there's reckless
driving involved, it's a 23-00-1.

383
00:17:17,474 --> 00:17:18,970
Watch out for the illegal transportation

384
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:21,077
of hazardous materials. 25-00-1.

385
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,078
Okay, that's enough.

386
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:26,422
I gotta go get some paper anyway.

387
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:28,534
- You know what?
- What?

388
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:29,697
I have worked hard.

389
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:32,804
I have done everything asked of me.
I am a good cop,

390
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,213
and I'm not going to stand here
and apologize for my good score.

391
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:37,975
So you are just gonna
have to get over it.

392
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,949
- Yeah. I can't do that.
- Well, then now what?

393
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:42,859
Your truck. Whoever solves that case
is the better detective.

394
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:45,228
Solve your own cases.
It's a refrigeration truck.

395
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:46,916
It's practically a victimless crime.

396
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:49,789
I guess you just don't count the people
who aren't gonna get their lobster

397
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:51,091
and sand dabs as victims.

398
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:54,458
I'm surprised the Miami P.D.
Didn't fail you for lack of compassion.

399
00:17:57,073 --> 00:17:59,176
Gus, what's wrong with me?

400
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:03,171
What is it that makes
all the guys go crazy on me?

401
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:05,647
Jann was an idiot for giving you up.

402
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:07,705
You're so sweet.

403
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:09,557
Sweet.

404
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:12,178
Sweet Gus.

405
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,293
Yeah, he's pretty sweet all right.

406
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:18,951
His head is like a chocolate-covered honeydew.

407
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:21,633
Now, would anyone like to talk about "Jan?"

408
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:23,445
It's Jann, with a "j."

409
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:28,117
Shawn is right. We should do that.
So this is all that I have.

410
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:33,002
I have some pictures of us together.
And a note that he wrote me.

411
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:34,776
And a lipstick from him.

412
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:45,973
Do you have any more pictures?

413
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:47,516
No.

414
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:52,673
Shawn.

415
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,283
Shouldn't you maybe go talk with Mira's parents?

416
00:18:55,372 --> 00:18:57,418
- I'll find you when we're finished.
- I haven't finished my...

417
00:18:57,522 --> 00:19:01,071
- It's fine. I'll finish it.
- You don't even know how to work with Cork!

418
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:16,532
Mrs. Gaffney.

419
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:17,782
Hello.

420
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:21,713
- My name is Shawn Spencer.
- Oh, I know who you are.

421
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:24,442
You're the psychic detective helping Mira.

422
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,208
You know, I've always been
fascinated by people with "the gift."

423
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:31,279
Uh, you're talking about this?
Well, that takes work.

424
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:33,538
I'd like to ask you a question about "Jan."

425
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:35,151
Jann?

426
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:37,500
I wouldn't know the first thing about him.

427
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:38,829
I see.

428
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:40,551
Because you haven't met him?

429
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,967
Very good.

430
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,838
This is our private wine
and alcohol collection.

431
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:48,387
Oh, I see.

432
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:52,466
I have a private room for all of my hello
kitty shot glasses and wild animal scat.

433
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,201
I have many interests.

434
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:57,617
Well, only a privileged
few are allowed down here.

435
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,330
The wine in this room
is worth over $1 million.

436
00:20:00,461 --> 00:20:03,134
We've been collecting it for years
from all over the world.

437
00:20:03,313 --> 00:20:04,749
Would you like a glass?

438
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:07,821
Actually, I prefer my wine in a box.

439
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,747
I've often heard that's the
best way to savor wine.

440
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,071
Just skip over the taste buds
and go right to the gullet.

441
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:26,067
I swear, if I have to deal with another
tourist today, my head is going to explode.

442
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,992
And David doesn't like me
drinking in front of the guests.

443
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:33,098
So, uh, how did you
manage to never meet Jan?

444
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:35,477
We tried to. Several times.

445
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:37,592
Take a sip before I finish the bottle.

446
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,362
That's... That's disgusting.

447
00:20:42,706 --> 00:20:45,604
That's a $30,000 bottle of spanish sherry.

448
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:54,403
It's good.

449
00:20:55,311 --> 00:21:02,494
You know, Shawn, I have very fine taste,
and I like my wine like I like my men...

450
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:05,805
White and hairy.

451
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:09,825
That doesn't make any sense.

452
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:12,361
None what so ever.

453
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,941
But I can see where Mira gets her spunkiness.

454
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,695
Phyllis, some of our guests are gonna...
What's going on here?

455
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:23,270
I was just explaing our frustration
over never meeting Jann.

456
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:25,701
Yeah, that guy.

457
00:21:25,882 --> 00:21:29,145
Yeah, every time we made plans,
he would change them at the last second

458
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,652
with that same lame excuse
about having to work overseas.

459
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:36,603
I cannot believe that I shut down
my winery for this wedding.

460
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:39,539
I should have known better.

461
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:45,021
Mira's choices in men have always been suspect.

462
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,580
Including that Guster.

463
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:50,473
And his supposedly psychic friend.

464
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:52,412
Now if you'll excuse us?

465
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,522
Yes, of course.

466
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:57,695
You have to finish packing your wine.

467
00:21:57,836 --> 00:21:59,825
You're moving into your winery in napa on friday,

468
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,517
and your amazing collection will
finally be on display for all to see.

469
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:06,657
- Hey, how'd you know that...
- Don't be intimidated, sir.

470
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:08,834
I'm just a man.

471
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:15,428
Oh, god.

472
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,623
- Brace yourself, Jan doesn't actually exist.
- What?

473
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:22,830
Fact, there is no record of a Jan Anglund,

474
00:22:22,952 --> 00:22:25,852
buyer of fine wines and food
on the internet anywhere.

475
00:22:26,105 --> 00:22:27,643
I did find a Jeff Anglund.

476
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:30,518
He's an albino with a website
dedicated to short circuit.

477
00:22:30,602 --> 00:22:32,569
- You put us on the email list?
- That's a given.

478
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:33,592
Nice.

479
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:35,595
Oh, so she was lying?

480
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:38,138
Or she really is checking
into the nutcracker suite.

481
00:22:38,228 --> 00:22:42,200
Hear me, Mira made Jan up.

482
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,869
She made him up?

483
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:45,631
What is...

484
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,192
Clozapine?

485
00:22:49,438 --> 00:22:52,343
It's an anti-anxiety drug.
It's also used to treat psychosis.

486
00:22:52,446 --> 00:22:53,561
Bingo.

487
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,610
Mira had a prescription to clozapine,
but the refill date was from way back when,

488
00:22:56,722 --> 00:23:00,252
- and she had a bunch of pills left.
- So she was off her meds.

489
00:23:00,374 --> 00:23:02,193
And off her rocker.
Even more so than her mother.

490
00:23:02,304 --> 00:23:03,225
What?

491
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:05,459
Let's just say I know where
Mira gets her freaky side.

492
00:23:05,547 --> 00:23:06,997
I can't believe this.

493
00:23:07,163 --> 00:23:08,774
I was feeling bad for Mira.

494
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:10,262
I even started to...

495
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:16,705
Oh, my gosh! Shawn, she did all this
to get me back. I fell for it again.

496
00:23:16,836 --> 00:23:18,831
But wait, there's more.

497
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:20,416
The pictures.

498
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:30,692
I sense something is very, very, very wrong
about these photos, very wrong indeed.

499
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:34,051
Jan Anglund doesn't exist.

500
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,030
- Thank you and good night.
- Wait, wait, wait a minute!

501
00:23:38,177 --> 00:23:40,863
Jan... Jann is real.
Why would I make any of this up?

502
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:42,785
To trick me into falling for you again.

503
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:46,214
I can't believe you'd go through
all of this just to get me back.

504
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,770
How sure are you about this theory?

505
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:50,046
Crystal.

506
00:23:50,828 --> 00:23:53,443
That doesn't really work. Very, very sure.

507
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,945
Then how do you explain him?

508
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:03,123
- Jann!
- Mira, honey, I'm so sorry.

509
00:24:06,336 --> 00:24:08,496
I'm gonna grab a clark bar
from the vending machine.

510
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,446
Uh, anyone else want anything?
Chief? Jules?

511
00:24:11,763 --> 00:24:13,369
Gus, you're good?

512
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:18,511
Okay. Honey. I looked for you at the winery,
but they said you were here.

513
00:24:18,615 --> 00:24:20,192
Where were you?

514
00:24:20,797 --> 00:24:22,742
- You didn't get my message?
- What message?

515
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,612
At the hotel desk.

516
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:28,704
Uh, look, I got a call to close this deal
with these venture capitalists in Portugal.

517
00:24:28,826 --> 00:24:31,973
It was for a very important client,
and I thought I could get back in time.

518
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:34,132
- Venture capitalists, really?
- I'm so sorry.

519
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:36,806
I never should have gone.
I missed our big day.

520
00:24:36,905 --> 00:24:38,693
I'm just glad you're okay.

521
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:42,480
Why don't we talk about this back at the winery
and spend some time getting to know you.

522
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:43,597
Yeah.

523
00:24:44,077 --> 00:24:46,331
- Just give me one second.
- All right.

524
00:24:49,726 --> 00:24:51,745
You... both.

525
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,186
I don't even know what to say to you.

526
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:56,273
How could you be so cruel?

527
00:24:58,773 --> 00:25:01,534
Doesn't exist, huh?
That's great.

528
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:05,476
Hey, should I put out an imaginary
A.P.B. for him on my invisible radio?

529
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,808
- I have a case to work.
- So do I.

530
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,919
Damn it, Shawn.

531
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:16,299
You made me look like a fool in front of Mira.

532
00:25:16,404 --> 00:25:20,010
Dude, you know deep, deep down that
there is something weird going on here.

533
00:25:20,094 --> 00:25:21,428
With Mira.

534
00:25:21,566 --> 00:25:24,261
With Jan suddenly appearing out of nowhere.

535
00:25:24,637 --> 00:25:27,202
I'm gonna prove it to you. I'm gonna show
you that something's going on.

536
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:30,252
No. No more, Shawn. Stop it.
I'm serious about this.

537
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,435
Fine.

538
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:34,095
For you, I'll stop.

539
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:36,054
Thank you.

540
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:45,302
What are you doing here?

541
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:47,902
Well, I was hoping to speak
with Jan for a minute.

542
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:50,189
- Jann.
- I won't call him that.

543
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:52,816
Yeah, he's off playing golf with my father.

544
00:25:52,964 --> 00:25:54,844
Ah, sweet.

545
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:58,729
- Is that it? 'cause I'm busy.
- Actually, there is one more thing.

546
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:04,469
Just between you and me, why'd you
fake those pictures of you and Jan?

547
00:26:05,193 --> 00:26:09,600
I may have been wrong about a couple of things,
but I know for a fact that those pictures are fakes.

548
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,224
Jan had a shaving cut in the same place
on his neck in each one of these pictures

549
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,631
even though they were
taken at different times of the year.

550
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:21,630
It's Gus' fault. Really.
Ever since what happened between he and I,

551
00:26:21,631 --> 00:26:24,575
my parents have been skeptical 
of every guy I've been with.

552
00:26:24,678 --> 00:26:29,842
Andy, Amir, Guru Anupam, Gay Andy, Anthony...

553
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:31,588
Does gay andy know you call him that?

554
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:35,344
He gave himself that name. Look, Jann and I had
only been together for a few weeks

555
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,943
when we decided to get married, and I know
that's crazy, but I just believe in all or nothing.

556
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:42,577
You know, doing what feels right.
Are you following me, Shawn?

557
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:46,790
What, are you kidding me? I spent an entire season
with an interpretive dance group in Buffalo.

558
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:49,241
But, see, my parents were against
this thing from the whole beginning.

559
00:26:49,344 --> 00:26:52,182
So Jann photoshopped some pictures to
make it look like we had been together

560
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:55,328
- for longer than we had, and it worked.
- Wait a second.

561
00:26:55,462 --> 00:26:57,490
You're saying the pictures were Jan's idea?

562
00:26:57,612 --> 00:26:58,918
No, Jann.

563
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,354
And yeah, he's the one with the super-fast printer.

564
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:03,529
I gotta get that.

565
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:05,466
Uh, that's coming from the room next door.

566
00:27:05,548 --> 00:27:06,956
Mira, Mira, Mira!

567
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,616
I said I was sorry about
what happened with Mira.

568
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:13,712
I am trying to make it up to you here.

569
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,360
Come on, man, we haven't played
golf in forever. This is gonna be fun.

570
00:27:16,997 --> 00:27:21,854
Plus, I promise to keep my caddy
shack references to a minimum.

571
00:27:23,813 --> 00:27:27,672
Now, I've heard this club is restricted,
so, uh, don't tell 'em you're jewish.

572
00:27:27,815 --> 00:27:29,656
- Shawn.
- I didn't say I wouldn't make any.

573
00:27:32,146 --> 00:27:34,738
What are you doing?
The lady's tee's up there.

574
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,710
Dude!

575
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:51,315
You know what would be more fun?

576
00:27:51,526 --> 00:27:53,117
Starting on the back nine.

577
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,919
Why can't we just start from here?

578
00:27:56,381 --> 00:27:58,916
I can par this hole with this putt.

579
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,958
Yes, yes, yes.

580
00:28:18,537 --> 00:28:20,779
- Great shot. Let's go.
- Shawn!

581
00:28:20,883 --> 00:28:23,878
Shawn, get back here before
I add two strokes to your score!

582
00:28:24,527 --> 00:28:26,052
What's the matter with you?

583
00:28:27,095 --> 00:28:29,884
Is this the real reason you brought
me golfing? To follow Jann?

584
00:28:30,026 --> 00:28:33,129
I told you to drop it. He's back.
There's no more case.

585
00:28:33,205 --> 00:28:35,779
Dude, you're wrong. Jan is the case.

586
00:28:35,902 --> 00:28:38,008
- He's the key.
- You're losing it.

587
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:42,444
Gus. Gus!

588
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:47,574
That's the P.I. from the batting cages.

589
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:50,358
Even you have to admit this is getting weird.

590
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:54,382
Act natural.

591
00:28:57,288 --> 00:28:59,138
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

592
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:00,723
What's up?

593
00:29:01,254 --> 00:29:03,000
Just playing a little golf.

594
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:06,523
Keeping an eye out for suspicious
meetings between shady people.

595
00:29:06,665 --> 00:29:08,984
What were you and Mace Rhoden arguing about?

596
00:29:09,951 --> 00:29:11,312
That was nothing.

597
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:15,943
You know, I was the guy who hired him.
I was late paying, so he was kind of upset.

598
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:18,712
Maybe Mira didn't tell you,
but I'm a psychic, yeah.

599
00:29:19,005 --> 00:29:23,424
And right now the spirits are screaming something
in my head over and over and over again.

600
00:29:23,744 --> 00:29:26,852
They're saying, "so se prometer
usar as penas."

601
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,536
- I don't understand.
- It's Portuguese for

602
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:33,083
"only if you promise to keep
your feathered headdress on."

603
00:29:33,295 --> 00:29:37,839
How can you possibly do business in Portugal
and not speak a word of the language?

604
00:29:37,924 --> 00:29:39,999
- Why did you really Miss the wedding?
- Okay,

605
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,065
- I wasn't in Europe.
- Yes!

606
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,689
Look, the truth is, I was in
another relationship.

607
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,856
I was in a bad situation. I had to end it
before I could get married to Mira.

608
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,127
- You were cheating on Mira?
- No, all right?

609
00:29:53,198 --> 00:29:55,793
No. Not exactly, okay?
It started before we even met.

610
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:58,180
And I promise you, it's over now.

611
00:29:58,316 --> 00:30:01,068
I know that I haven't always been a good guy.

612
00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:05,586
But being with Mira,
you know, it's changed me.

613
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,538
I realize now that she's the
only thing in my life that matters.

614
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:13,176
And you may not believe me, but that
is the truest thing I have ever said.

615
00:30:14,556 --> 00:30:18,387
Look, I'd better get back before
Mira's dad despises me even more.

616
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
Shawn...

617
00:30:26,084 --> 00:30:28,452
I've been there before when it comes to Mira.

618
00:30:28,581 --> 00:30:32,735
- He's telling the truth.
- Yeah, but he's definitely lying.

619
00:30:33,112 --> 00:30:35,596
- How can he be doing both?
- Trust me.

620
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:41,072
As someone who has occasionally dealt with
half-truths, Jan Brady is not telling us everything.

621
00:30:41,311 --> 00:30:43,617
He's my informant.
I'll get the information we need.

622
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:45,945
Carlton, this is my case.

623
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:49,561
And besides, your tough-guy
interrogation technique, it's not gonna work.

624
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:51,965
Oh, and you think sweet and gentle's
gonna get info from a guy like this?

625
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:55,038
Please. All I need is 30 seconds.
You could time me.

626
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:58,162
Fine, I'll play that game.
And I will beat you at it.

627
00:30:58,347 --> 00:30:59,481
- Fine.
- McNab!

628
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,207
We're commandeering your watch.

629
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:03,923
You're commandeering my... watch.

630
00:31:05,236 --> 00:31:06,222
Okay.

631
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,815
Now watch... how I break this guy.

632
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:13,748
It's all in the eyes.

633
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:39,535
- All right. You little son of a...
- Time!

634
00:31:39,717 --> 00:31:42,246
- What? I just got started.
- They're your rules.

635
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:43,962
Crap.

636
00:31:48,516 --> 00:31:50,307
- Hey.
- Hi.

637
00:31:50,518 --> 00:31:51,511
You look hungry.

638
00:31:52,632 --> 00:31:54,511
- Kinda.
- Thanks.

639
00:31:55,507 --> 00:31:56,507
So...

640
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:01,866
what can you tell me about a refrigeration
truck that was stolen a few days ago?

641
00:32:02,244 --> 00:32:03,700
Refrigeration truck?

642
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:06,352
Oh, come on.

643
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:08,551
All I need's a name, Rusty.

644
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,977
I know about pretty much every
car boosted in Santa Barbara,

645
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:16,839
but nothing as pointless as
stealing a refrigerator truck.

646
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:18,469
Honest.

647
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:21,089
Time!

648
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:32,109
All right, cut the crap, Rusty. We both
know that you are holding out on me.

649
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:35,012
- I was eating that candy bar.
- Well, the candy police aren't here today.

650
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:38,029
It's just me, and I got at least 12
different charges I could pin on you.

651
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:40,485
So you better start giving
me some good information.

652
00:32:40,621 --> 00:32:42,426
I don't know.

653
00:32:42,616 --> 00:32:46,324
Look, there's only two reasons
why anybody steals a car.

654
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,781
To sell it or to use it.

655
00:32:48,855 --> 00:32:52,830
Since nobody's come down to my shop
to sell me your precious little truck,

656
00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:54,662
they need it for something.

657
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,951
Time!

658
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,676
- Don't you dare tell her a thing.
- Oh, that's great detective work.

659
00:33:00,776 --> 00:33:03,492
Probably why you scored a whole
point lower than me on the exam.

660
00:33:03,652 --> 00:33:06,211
Sorry to interrupt, but the chief
needs you for an important case.

661
00:33:11,507 --> 00:33:14,124
- They took my clark bar.
- They took my watch.

662
00:33:19,696 --> 00:33:22,700
- What's going on?
- It's about Mira's fiance.

663
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:25,007
I knew it. The guy's a crook.

664
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:26,240
All right!

665
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,217
Playtime's over, Jan!

666
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:31,407
I've had a bad psychic vibe
about you from the beginning.

667
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:34,948
Why don't you go ahead and tell us
what you've really been up to?

668
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,511
Whenever you're ready, Jan.

669
00:33:42,593 --> 00:33:43,720
Jan?

670
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,416
Let's do a loop.

671
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,240
I knew Jann was bad news.

672
00:33:49,338 --> 00:33:52,319
Wow, Gus, you were so right.
Why didn't I listen to you?

673
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:54,535
We need to find out who killed him.

674
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,922
That's a good idea.

675
00:34:05,992 --> 00:34:07,494
Dude, I have a theory.

676
00:34:07,597 --> 00:34:10,507
I don't think Jan and Mace were
just arguing about money.

677
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:12,751
- What else were they arguing about?
- I don't know yet.

678
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,309
But I want to talk to Lassie
and Jules. Let's go.

679
00:34:15,468 --> 00:34:19,045
Oh, yeah, um, I'm not gonna be able
to make it. I'am go by the winery.

680
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:21,374
Mira called. She was wondering
if I would come by.

681
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,537
- Gus.
- I'll be fine, Shawn.

682
00:34:23,634 --> 00:34:26,382
I just wanna be there for her as a friend.

683
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:28,688
- All right.
- Cool.

684
00:34:30,252 --> 00:34:31,792
Oh, good. You're all here.

685
00:34:31,877 --> 00:34:35,219
I'm having a psychic vision about Jan, and
I have a theory about who may have killed him.

686
00:34:35,313 --> 00:34:38,054
Let's just take a step back, Mr. Spencer.

687
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:45,033
I just got the fingerprint results
from the refrigerator truck case.

688
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:46,952
Do you wanna take turns with this?

689
00:34:47,782 --> 00:34:49,277
Take turns? What's going on here?

690
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:51,190
O'hara and I have a little
competition... excuse me.

691
00:34:51,286 --> 00:34:52,279
Competition?

692
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:54,224
It is not a competition.

693
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,322
Lassiter is just being a child about
his detective exam score.

694
00:34:57,425 --> 00:34:59,885
Wait, the D.E.T.? I took that when I was 15.

695
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:01,325
I got 100.

696
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:04,113
- I'm sorry. You said you got a perfect score?
- Yeah.

697
00:35:04,212 --> 00:35:06,053
- And you were 15?
- Yeah.

698
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,095
Why? What did you guys get?

699
00:35:09,248 --> 00:35:11,897
You know, it's probably changed a
lot since then. You really can't compare it.

700
00:35:11,972 --> 00:35:13,390
Apples and oranges.

701
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:17,283
He cheated on me, and then he lied to me
about missing the wedding, and now he's dead.

702
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:19,446
- I know exactly how you feel.
- Really?

703
00:35:19,545 --> 00:35:22,027
- Well... no.
- I always knew that

704
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:25,462
there was something wrong with Jann. From the
very beginning, there was a little voice inside me

705
00:35:25,547 --> 00:35:28,818
that said it was all wrong, but
I didn't listen 'cause he had andy's laugh

706
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:32,125
and gay Andy's
sense of style, and your heart.

707
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:35,740
At least that's what I thought.

708
00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:41,128
- What was that?
- I don't know, but my parents are gone

709
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,968
and the vineyard's closed.

710
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:50,207
Somebody's been in here.

711
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:53,404
Yeah, I think maybe we should call the police.

712
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,704
Good idea.

713
00:36:00,218 --> 00:36:02,443
Officer McNab, you were saying?

714
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:05,723
Uh, yeah, the lab matched one of the prints
from the gold lighter that was dropped when

715
00:36:05,738 --> 00:36:10,327
the truck was stolen to a known convict
named Marcus Ridley, a.k.a. Mike Ray, a.k.a.

716
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:13,842
My eyes! It's burning! It's stinging!

717
00:36:13,942 --> 00:36:16,940
Stuff that old women carry in their purses!

718
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,983
- Velamints?
- No, it's more of an aerosol.

719
00:36:19,086 --> 00:36:21,405
- Binaca!
- It's not a breath freshener!

720
00:36:21,455 --> 00:36:23,129
- Mace!
- Yes.

721
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,093
Mace Rhoden. That's right.

722
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:31,781
- Was the truck yellow?
- Well, more like a mustard, but yeah.

723
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:35,023
Oh, I'm getting another vision.
Two, two, two visions in one.

724
00:36:35,117 --> 00:36:38,071
It's Gus and the truck in the same place.

725
00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:39,724
Gus is in danger.

726
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:42,724
We have to save Gus!

727
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:44,295
Come on!

728
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:50,154
All right, I left Mr. And Mrs. Gaffney
a message, but Gus isn't picking up at all.

729
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:51,711
- Someone give me a gun.
- No.

730
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,743
- What exactly is going on?
- Okay, okay,

731
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:57,427
remember when I said that Jan Anglund
didn't exist? Well, technically I was right.

732
00:36:57,496 --> 00:36:59,842
You know what? Forget that.
I was totally right.

733
00:36:59,902 --> 00:37:03,334
He's not Jan Anglund. He's a con
man working with Mace Rhoden,

734
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:06,043
the guy who stole your
mustard refrigerator truck.

735
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:07,677
Keep talking.

736
00:37:08,074 --> 00:37:11,692
Well, a few months ago, they started
a long con on Mira Gaffney.

737
00:37:11,817 --> 00:37:15,735
The plan was for Jan to romance Mira and
marry her on the beach in Santa Barbara.

738
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:18,366
But Mira's parents asked too many questions.

739
00:37:18,432 --> 00:37:21,227
So Jan doctored the photos to
convince them to have the wedding.

740
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:24,572
See, my parents were against this thing
from the beginning, so Jann photoshopped some

741
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:27,779
pictures to make it look like we've been
together for longer than we had, and it worked.

742
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:33,011
The wedding was merely a cover, so that Mira's
father would shut down the winery for a day.

743
00:37:33,171 --> 00:37:36,960
Jan intended to leave Mira at the altar,
while Mace broke into David

744
00:37:36,975 --> 00:37:40,964
Gaffney's cellar to steal his priceless
wine collection and skip town.

745
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,513
But there was no robbery at the winery.
And Jan didn't skip town. He came back.

746
00:37:44,588 --> 00:37:46,598
- He had a change of heart.
- Oh, don't...

747
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:50,890
There's something about Mira. Jan was
telling the truth and lying at the same time.

748
00:37:50,984 --> 00:37:54,739
The truth is, I was in another relationship.
I was in a bad situation.

749
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,142
I had to end it before I could marry Mira.

750
00:37:57,256 --> 00:37:59,757
His other relationship was with his partner Mace.

751
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:03,471
He ended it because he actually fell in love
with Mira and couldn't go through with the plan.

752
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:06,584
That's why they argued at the golf course.
And that's why Mace killed him.

753
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,777
- But why is Guster in trouble?
- Because it's thursday night, Lassie.

754
00:38:09,862 --> 00:38:12,963
The Gaffneys are moving their most
expensive bottles of wine to napa tomorrow.

755
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:16,678
Meaning that Mace is stealing them right now!
Somebody give me a gun!

756
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:18,139
- No.
- Then drive faster!

757
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,146
That's my best friend in there!

758
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:29,543
Good! You got my message.

759
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,570
Yeah, we looked. We can't find 'em anywhere.

760
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:33,853
The wine cellar. Gus!

761
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:35,930
Gus!

762
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:39,637
Don't shoot! Everything's okay.

763
00:38:39,741 --> 00:38:41,510
- Mira?
- Mom!

764
00:38:41,606 --> 00:38:44,007
What is going on here?
What have you gotten her into?

765
00:38:44,082 --> 00:38:46,138
Gus! Don't speak.

766
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:49,198
I can tell you precisely
what happened here, sir.

767
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,888
Gus and Mira discovered, uh,
Mace Rhoden robbing the cellar.

768
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:54,588
He pulled a gun.

769
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:56,448
He tied them up.

770
00:38:56,572 --> 00:38:59,570
And Gus assessed the situation and
devised the following brilliant plan.

771
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:03,711
He finessed them loose. He told Mira to
perform her dragon-headed bar trick

772
00:39:03,796 --> 00:39:07,151
that made him fall for her in the
first place, triggering the sprinklers.

773
00:39:07,226 --> 00:39:09,169
They wrestled over the gun.

774
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:13,811
Mira fainted.

775
00:39:13,982 --> 00:39:17,174
And we walked in just as
Gus D.T.D.'D the bad guy.

776
00:39:17,552 --> 00:39:19,824
Well done, Guster. Well done.

777
00:39:20,045 --> 00:39:22,071
- Thank you, sir.
- Very impressive.

778
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,869
Yeah, very quick thinking.

779
00:39:24,537 --> 00:39:26,676
I was just doing what anyone would have done.

780
00:39:26,915 --> 00:39:28,870
Honey, let's get you out of here.

781
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:31,804
- But I don't remem...
- darling, come here.

782
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:32,891
Come on, sweetie.

783
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:34,585
Let's go.

784
00:39:34,726 --> 00:39:36,379
Yeah, it's time to go.

785
00:39:36,463 --> 00:39:37,693
God, he's all wet.

786
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,546
- Dude, that's not how it happened.
- I know.

787
00:39:44,622 --> 00:39:47,122
Mace's cigarette triggered the
sprinklers, and he slipped and fell?

788
00:39:47,243 --> 00:39:49,975
And then I may have knocked Mira over as I ran away.

789
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,357
- Let's keep that last part to ourselves. 
- You bet.

790
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:59,034
You guys, it's been such a crazy week.

791
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:02,593
But thanks to you both,
I'm gonna get through it.

792
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:04,370
So thank you.

793
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,554
Oh, oh, Shawn, Gus and me are gonna
go rock climbing in Rattlesnake canyon.

794
00:40:08,677 --> 00:40:11,383
And then I'm gonna teach him how
to hang glide off cathedral peak.

795
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:14,594
And it's gonna be so amazing.
Do you wanna come?

796
00:40:19,614 --> 00:40:20,985
You know what, Mira?

797
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:25,327
We just got a call from a prospective client.
Something about a ghost in a ballroom.

798
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,769
We should probably go work on that.
Is that okay, Mira?

799
00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:32,066
Oh, of course. I totally understand.
You guys do amazing work.

800
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,588
But I just wanna see you both before I leave.

801
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:37,568
Mira's moving to Greenland
to save polar bears.

802
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:39,051
Of course you are.

803
00:40:40,018 --> 00:40:42,584
- Do you wanna come visit for Christmas?
- Gus is coming for Christmas.

804
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:46,466
- I am?
- Yeah, remember? We talked about this, silly.

805
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:48,468
Think about it. Bye.

806
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:50,451
Thanks again, guys.

807
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:57,610
Dude, thank you for that.

808
00:40:58,129 --> 00:41:00,570
And thank you for putting up with
me throughout this whole thing.

809
00:41:00,664 --> 00:41:01,966
- I know I was a little...
- Whipped.

810
00:41:02,073 --> 00:41:03,238
- Gay?
- No.

811
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,890
- Annoying?
- Well, I was gonna say love struck

812
00:41:05,984 --> 00:41:07,627
but, sure, fine.

813
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:10,044
And once again, I just wanna say for the record,

814
00:41:10,147 --> 00:41:12,654
I'm sorry I never told you about being married.

815
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:14,210
I understand.

816
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:16,880
Now I really understand.

817
00:41:17,386 --> 00:41:19,595
Besides, I've been feeling a little guilty myself.

818
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:23,144
- About what?
- About not telling you that I too was married.

819
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:26,587
What? You were not married, Shawn. Please.

820
00:41:29,243 --> 00:41:30,769
This is a fake, right?

821
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:34,344
I know this is fake. You photoshopped this.

822
00:41:34,456 --> 00:41:38,090
Shawn, get back here! You trying to tell
me you went skydiving with a rabbi?

823
00:41:38,235 --> 00:41:39,189
Shawn!
