1
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,796
Dad?

2
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:07,673
I'm not feeling well.

3
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:10,156
Come here.
Let me take a look.

4
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:17,326
150-degree temperature.

5
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:20,024
I'm probably too sick
to go to Jimmy Peoples' house.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,781
You better call and cancel.

7
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,511
Right after that, I'll call the coroner.
150-degree temperature,

8
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:26,794
- you're a dead man walking.
- I am?

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,653
I give you 5,
10 minutes to live, tops.

10
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:32,904
The good news is, this happened
soon enough for your mother

11
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:35,880
and I to start over again.
Maybe this time we'll have a girl.

12
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:38,829
How'd you know I was faking?

13
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,078
Your first mistake was sticking
the thermometer in boiling water.

14
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:44,546
Next time,
try putting it in a hot sandwich

15
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:46,402
or behind the television.

16
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:49,380
And why don't you want to go to Jimmy's?
They were kind enough to invite us over.

17
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:52,009
They're the weirdest family
on the entire block.

18
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:54,694
Shawn, there is something weird
about every family.

19
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:57,735
- That's what makes America great.
- They eat weird food.

20
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,766
All food is weird until you try it.

21
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,185
- I mean, they don't even eat meat.
- You mean they're vegetarians.

22
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,606
I think they call it "vegan".

23
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,565
You guys ready
for some barbecue tofu?

24
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,322
I think I got that same thing
you got.

25
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:25,286
I'll be right back.

26
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,544
Thank you, gentlemen,
for helping out.

27
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:29,588
Search and rescue is my middle name.

28
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,757
Our missing person
is Warren Clayton.

29
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:34,205
- The billionaire investor?
- Yes, that's the one.

30
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,721
His hedge fund has had an average annual
return of 20% for the last 10 years.

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,679
Mr. Clayton's private plane lost contact
with the tower around 0700.

32
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:44,645
We have reason to believe that his plane
crashed somewhere in these mountains.

33
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,743
Now, Mr. Spencer,
time is of the essence.

34
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,609
I need to know of any signals that
you pick up that can lead us to him.

35
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:55,226
Okay, people, our window
of finding Clayton alive is closing.

36
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:56,698
So let's move on out.

37
00:01:57,703 --> 00:01:59,576
Face it, Spencer,
you don't have a chance

38
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:01,549
of finding that downed plane
before we do.

39
00:02:01,674 --> 00:02:03,671
But... have a nice walk.

40
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:06,371
Let's go.

41
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:17,177
Note to self:
get one of those for the office.

42
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:20,192
I hope you have a plan as to how
we're going to find this crashed plane.

43
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:22,840
And I hope that plan doesn't end up
with us being eaten by a bear.

44
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:25,977
- Don't worry. We have a secret weapon.
- A larger, bear-eating bear?

45
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:29,356
A map?
That's your secret weapon?

46
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,748
This is not a typical map,
my friend.

47
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:36,202
With large words that people
don't understand, like "latitudinal"

48
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:37,615
and "east".

49
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,409
This here is a map
from my father's huntsman club.

50
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,328
These old geezers
make their own maps with trails

51
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:46,790
and paths, landmarks,
that government maps don't even have.

52
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,835
We will use these shortcuts
to cover more ground than the cops can.

53
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:51,796
Sweet.

54
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:00,814
That sounded big.

55
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,397
That's a bear.
Let's get out of here.

56
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,787
- I'm not gonna be eaten!
- Me either!

57
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:22,847
- Did that sound like metal to you?
- It did.

58
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:34,964
That's him.

59
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,009
Dude, we're heroes.

60
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,179
Right. Don't worry, Mr. Clayton.
Help is on the way.

61
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,059
- No signal!
- All right, sir.

62
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,880
It's gonna be okay.
Just try to hold still.

63
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:04,493
Need to make amends.

64
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:07,184
Good father.

65
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,927
You understand?

66
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:11,452
You know, good father's kind
of a tricky subject for me.

67
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:13,936
Try to conserve your energy,
Mr. Clayton.

68
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:16,182
Waterloo.

69
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:17,618
He's an Abba fan.

70
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:19,675
Find out

71
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:22,402
who killed me.

72
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,823
- Open your eyes. Stay with us here.
- Watch out.

73
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:28,072
I know what to do.
Mr. Clayton. Mr. Clayton.

74
00:04:28,197 --> 00:04:30,867
What industry sectors do you see
outperforming the market this year?

75
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:32,094
Are you serious?

76
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:34,577
I'm trying to give him something
to think about.

77
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:35,900
It didn't work.

78
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:38,903
He's dead.

79
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:42,226
That's a lose-lose.

80
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,008
Psych 402
"He Dead"

81
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:04,076
Timing: Psych Team

82
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,190
<i>Lower the basket
as soon as you're in position.</i>

83
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:21,232
See you back at base camp.

84
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,510
It's out of our hands now.

85
00:05:24,635 --> 00:05:25,621
Not so fast.

86
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:27,857
We've been given
a great responsibility.

87
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:28,982
How so?

88
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:31,638
Warren Clayton's dying wish.

89
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:34,866
Man, what if that had been your dad?
Or my dad?

90
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:38,085
Some other random black guy and white
guy found him with one breath left?

91
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:41,589
Wouldn't you want those dudes
to fulfill our dads' final wish?

92
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:44,801
- Especially if it was about us?
- You think of me as some random Black?

93
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,844
Man, we gotta figure out
what happened.

94
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,471
What did he mean?

95
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,593
I mean, was he poisoned
before takeoff,

96
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,243
or was he incapacitated,
and then somebody else parachuted out?

97
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:56,255
- Or maybe it was a...
- It wasn't a bear.

98
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,254
- I wasn't gonna say that, Shawn.
- What were you gonna say?

99
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:09,284
We know you want answers. But you gotta
understand, these things do take time.

100
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,994
Please.
It only takes money.

101
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,331
Have you found satellite imaging
of the plane before it crashed?

102
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,791
- Have you run a weather simulation?
- Rest assured

103
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:20,086
that the SBPD is putting
all available resources on this.

104
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:23,089
Almost all of its resources.

105
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:25,967
My name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm the department psychic.

106
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,385
Mrs. Clayton,

107
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:30,221
I'm receiving a psychic transmission
from your husband.

108
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,860
It's really more of a voice mail,
if I'm being honest.

109
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:34,298
A status update.

110
00:06:34,423 --> 00:06:36,394
- Perhaps a twitter.
- It's called a tweet.

111
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,438
- No way I'm saying that.
- Is he for real?

112
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:40,901
In spite of Mr. Spencer's
first impression,

113
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,276
he is actually the one
who led us to your husband's plane.

114
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:45,485
He knew what clothes
your husband was wearing,

115
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,743
how his body was positioned,
even what cologne he was...

116
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:50,720
I knew what cologne he was wearing.
I mean, he did.

117
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:55,372
Well, let's hear this supposed message
from my husband.

118
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,259
It's a little cloudy,
Warren is very upset.

119
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,584
He's saying...

120
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,587
"murder". He's saying "murder".

121
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,548
Does the word "waterloo"
mean anything to you, Mrs. Clayton?

122
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,854
You've wasted enough of Mrs. Clayton's
time with your nonsense.

123
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:10,971
No, wait.

124
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,847
I'm really quite shocked.

125
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:14,475
You are?

126
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:17,351
Yes, it just doesn't show on my face
because of years of botox.

127
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,313
Waterloo is the name of the 18th hole
at our country club.

128
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,151
Warren mentioned just a week ago
that he wanted his ashes spread there.

129
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,092
- Yes, of course.
- Strange.

130
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:28,113
Not strange.

131
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:29,947
Psychic acumen.

132
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,420
You will solve the mystery
of why my husband's plane crashed.

133
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:35,647
Technically,
Mr. Spencer's not been hired...

134
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:37,706
This no longer concerns the police,

135
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,291
as I will be financing
Mr. Spencer's operations.

136
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:43,018
I am sure the taxpayers' money
is better spent

137
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:46,214
on some social program, or a tree.

138
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,166
What resources will you be needing?

139
00:07:50,532 --> 00:07:51,261
One.

140
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,857
A case of red vines,
individually wrapped.

141
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:56,016
Two, mini fridge filled
with cactus cooler.

142
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,551
- Need a shamwow.
- A new laptop. Tell her.

143
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:02,856
A new laptop,
preferably one made of red vines.

144
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,156
Gentlemen, you are no longer limited
by a police department budget.

145
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:08,486
Tell me what it will take
to get this done quickly.

146
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:11,948
Well, in that case,
I'll need to become Warren Clayton.

147
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,371
Go where he'd go, do what he'd do,
see what he'd see.

148
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,728
Very well. You will start your work

149
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:20,290
by being my guests at dinner tonight
at my estate.

150
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:21,779
The estate.

151
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:22,876
Say what?

152
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,545
- I'll send the car to pick you up.
- The car.

153
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:26,505
Nice.

154
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:28,798
- The door.
- The door.

155
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,967
- Big door.
- The door!

156
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:32,427
Of course, the door.

157
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:39,434
Get out of here.

158
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,533
As I gently held his skull,

159
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:48,858
which was fractured
in several places,

160
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:51,475
I was able
to keep death's cold clutch

161
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,128
from enveloping Clayton
just long enough

162
00:08:54,662 --> 00:08:56,701
for him to express his dying wish.

163
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:59,370
Shawn, that is revisionist history
and you know it.

164
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:01,289
- You had to be there.
- I was there.

165
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,458
- It's okay. When he embellishes...
- Lies.

166
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,794
- Clarifies.
- It lets me know that he cares.

167
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
But what I really want to know
is when can I meet your father?

168
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:14,260
My relationship with my father
is... complicated.

169
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:17,792
As I believe I've mentioned.
And I know you...

170
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,475
You'll wanna get in there
and fix everything.

171
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,702
And no amount of talking
or listening

172
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:25,021
or hugging is going to fix anything
between me and my dad.

173
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:26,191
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:29,109
I hear you,
and I'm going to stop pressuring you.

175
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,152
Thank you.

176
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:33,552
Besides, you already know everything
there is to know about me.

177
00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:35,520
I'm really quite a simple man.

178
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:39,202
Mr. Spencer's private car is here
to take him to the Clayton estate.

179
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,487
- Thank you, my good man.
- We are ready.

180
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,882
Dinner will be served shortly.

181
00:09:57,842 --> 00:09:58,847
Note to self:

182
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,015
be rich one day.

183
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:02,308
This is what real class looks like.

184
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,869
I feel like I'm in a museum filled
with priceless artifacts.

185
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:09,888
Only here you're not allowed to touch
or play with anything.

186
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,071
But let's not be blinded
by the bling.

187
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:17,123
Remember, we're here
to fulfill Mr. Clayton's dying wish.

188
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:19,701
- Find out who it was that murdered him.
- If he was even murdered.

189
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:23,045
For all we know,
he was hallucinating when he said that.

190
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:26,678
Make no mistake, Gus.
When I cradled the man's head

191
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:29,711
and he breathed his last breath,
he looked right into my eyes.

192
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,419
And I am certain he knew exactly
what he was saying.

193
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:34,466
I was there.
You didn't cradle anything.

194
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,968
There you are.

195
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,553
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I was putting things away.

196
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,848
So many memories of Clay.
That's what I called him.

197
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,888
Is that an ultra-high modulus
hyper carbon racket?

198
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,272
This is my birthday present
from him last year.

199
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:51,275
He even signed me up
for tennis lessons with Malavia.

200
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,360
Malavia Washington?
The one-time Wimbledon finalist?

201
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:58,282
But he's a marvelous teacher.
I never missed a lesson.

202
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,522
Thank you, Mrs. Clayton, for inviting us
here to your beautiful home.

203
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:02,703
My pleasure.

204
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,193
We're all very eager
to learn the circumstances

205
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:07,190
behind my husband's accident.

206
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:09,699
Our son is beside himself about it.

207
00:11:09,824 --> 00:11:12,713
Garvin, remember mommy
telling you about the psychic

208
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,799
who saw why papa's plane crashed?

209
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,177
That's unusual.

210
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:21,629
It's very... heathers.

211
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:23,598
What do they call you?

212
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:24,891
Gar?

213
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:28,384
- Vin?
- I get it, even though I was, like,

214
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,106
zero when that movie came out.

215
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:34,182
Man, stop trying to look cool.

216
00:11:34,307 --> 00:11:35,807
I have peeps, Shawn.

217
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,197
You have two peeps. And one of them's
made out of marshmallow.

218
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:43,368
Mrs. Clayton, you don't mind my asking,
who is the girl in the family photos?

219
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,413
That's my daughter, Nyna.
She's no longer with us.

220
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,540
I'm so sorry to hear that.

221
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:53,044
Quiet, everyone.

222
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:56,006
Mr. Spencer will now
have a revelation

223
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,592
regarding the cause
of Warren's crash.

224
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,676
What...
Have a revelation?

225
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:02,942
I'm not.

226
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:07,392
It's too early for that.
We haven't even had our foie gras yet.

227
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:09,141
Foie gras.

228
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:13,845
I have to decipher psychic signals.

229
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,193
It's very important that I tap
into your husband's aurora.

230
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:20,238
Tell me, Mrs. Clayton, does he have
a smoking jacket that I could wear?

231
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:23,250
Does he have down sheets, and if so,
are they hypoallergenic,

232
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,911
because I would hate
for my signals to get

233
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,538
all scrambled up while I'm sleeping
here tonight in your home.

234
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:31,078
Based on your earlier display,

235
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:33,919
- I expected immediate results.
- Bogus.

236
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:36,254
Poser.

237
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:40,675
Asthma.

238
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,101
- He's allergic to rich white people.
- Sorry.

239
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:45,222
As I was saying,

240
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,607
I pay for results.

241
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:50,936
My new chin is proof of that.

242
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:56,149
Our family needs closure before
Warren's will is unsealed this weekend.

243
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,652
Since you are unable to deliver,
Rosa, would you put

244
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,737
Mr. Spencer's food
in some sort of a bag?

245
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,738
Where shall I have the car
drop you off?

246
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,157
Hold that thought.

247
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:10,667
As luck would have it,

248
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:13,921
exactly two of my psychic channels
are clearing up,

249
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:16,628
and I am getting something.

250
00:13:17,353 --> 00:13:18,672
I thought you might.

251
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,092
[It has nothing to do with Mr. Clayton
and everything to do with you.

252
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:26,972
You've been seeing a tennis instructor
every week for the la year,

253
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,072
but you haven't been playing tennis.
Though you have been playing with balls.

254
00:13:30,197 --> 00:13:31,266
I see a very...

255
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,770
- compromising image.
- I don't know what you mean.

256
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:38,024
Is that why you practice at night?

257
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,152
This isn't supposed to be about me.

258
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,527
No wonder you have
so many sexy tennis outfits.

259
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,491
I'm not gonna sit here and be judged.
If I were having an affair, it would be

260
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,870
because we have a loveless marriage,
and not through any fault of my own.

261
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,830
I don't talk ill of the dead.

262
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:54,354
I'll talk about him
any way I please.

263
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:57,294
In fact,
not that I owe you an explanation,

264
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,362
but before he died,
things had gotten better.

265
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:01,631
He was trying to be the man
that I once loved.

266
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:08,914
Funny you should chime in.

267
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,475
You know the Clayton's philandering ways
better than anyone,

268
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:14,853
seeing as how you were
in fact senor Clayton's mistress.

269
00:14:16,265 --> 00:14:17,230
What?

270
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:20,668
That's why you pray to St. Dwynwen,

271
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,820
the patron saint of dirty filthy lovers
in the nighttime.

272
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,155
Who is this man?
Make me make him leave.

273
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:28,073
You had an affair with my husband?

274
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,408
How dare you!

275
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:32,829
- You're no better, <i>puta</i>.
- You know what? This is all your fault.

276
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,885
You pushed him away
and he took it out on me.

277
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,240
Taking away my Porsche,
making me get a job,

278
00:14:37,365 --> 00:14:39,624
selling my tiger.
And I hated you both.

279
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:41,667
You blame everybody
for your pathetic...

280
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:43,778
This family is crazy as hell.

281
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:47,093
Now we see why Warren Clayton
thought he was murdered.

282
00:14:49,997 --> 00:14:53,600
As you can see, like most families,
we have our issues.

283
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,854
Now that you are privy to them, I expect
you to handle this with discretion.

284
00:14:58,502 --> 00:15:00,732
We do have a public image
to protect.

285
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,725
That's going to be difficult.

286
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,820
Especially once I prove
that it was one of you three

287
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:08,031
who killed Warren Clayton.

288
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,127
Is that so?

289
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,427
And how is my favorite
police department doing today?

290
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:32,218
Lassie, looking handsome and jangly.

291
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:34,432
Chief... 
I don't say this nearly enough...

292
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:36,810
You have exquisite teeth.

293
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,141
Mr. Spencer, you know,
the last I'd heard

294
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:41,871
is that you'd taken an assignment
that provided you with

295
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:43,733
more benefits
than what we could give you.

296
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,563
Yes, unfortunately,

297
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:48,405
Mrs. Clayton and I
were unable to see eye to eye.

298
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:51,813
- In other words, you got fired.
- Or maybe I was getting too close.

299
00:15:51,938 --> 00:15:54,661
Or maybe you were acting
like an obnoxious little twerp.

300
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,542
I'm sticking with getting too close.

301
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,426
It's nice to hear the word "twerp"

302
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:00,088
has survived the millennium.

303
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:01,742
Trust me on this one, chief.

304
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:05,088
There is more to Warren Clayton's
plane crash than meets the eye.

305
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:08,672
Funny, the NTSB's
preliminary report indicates

306
00:16:08,797 --> 00:16:10,719
that it was an accident
due to pilot error.

307
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,849
The black box shows that he was coming
into SB and descended too rapidly.

308
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:20,258
Trust requires evidence,
Mr. Spencer.

309
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:24,732
I'm getting distinct visions.

310
00:16:24,857 --> 00:16:26,109
Family secrets.

311
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:28,138
A large skeleton

312
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,446
in a closet.

313
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,073
Clayton was trying to make amends.

314
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,858
But he was being met
with infidelities and backbiting.

315
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,746
And front biting.

316
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,039
And jealousies.

317
00:16:40,202 --> 00:16:41,521
I suppose it couldn't hurt

318
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:43,877
to check to see if there are
any signs of a cover-up,

319
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,630
just in case
there's anything to his premonition.

320
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,048
Chief, come on.

321
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:51,830
And you better come up
with something soon,

322
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:55,216
or this will be the second time
that you're fired from the same case.

323
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:57,225
I hear you.
Thank you for taking the leap.

324
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,975
What time should I expect the car?

325
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,608
You think you guys could spring
for a case of red vines?

326
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,167
This is
how I should be living by now.

327
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:18,703
Where did I go wrong?

328
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:20,858
I don't know about you, Gus,

329
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:23,333
but I was born
into the wrong family.

330
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,913
If I belonged to a club like this,
I'd have to cancel my membership

331
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:28,374
on account of them
letting in the likes of me.

332
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:30,499
And if you voted for me, well,

333
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:32,296
I'm afraid you

334
00:17:32,828 --> 00:17:34,587
don't belong in my club either.

335
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:36,178
That doesn't even make sense.

336
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:38,181
Neither does "thoo,"
but it is a word.

337
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,224
No, it's not.

338
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,768
There's simply no way to be sure.
My point is this:

339
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:45,870
no matter how glamorous their lives
look from the outside, these...

340
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:48,700
- are not our kind of people.
- Will you stop it?

341
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,994
Take Mr. Clayton, for example.

342
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,469
He was the patriarch of his family,
yet where were they

343
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:55,901
when the life was draining
out of his body

344
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:58,910
and that sweet chariot had swung low
to carry him home?

345
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:02,279
Out philandering
and social climbing, I suspect.

346
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:04,519
Meanwhile, where was I?

347
00:18:04,998 --> 00:18:08,211
- I was beside him. Like a true friend.
- Stop it.

348
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:10,505
I see the two of you
don't give up easily.

349
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,468
You should know that this is now
an official police investigation.

350
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:19,359
We've been granted full access,
and if your family's hiding anything,

351
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:20,432
we'll find it.

352
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,768
We don't hide anything
except large amounts of money,

353
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,217
illegitimate children, and...

354
00:18:27,112 --> 00:18:28,962
the fact that we're jewish.

355
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,027
We may have a lot of secrets,
but killing Clay isn't one of them.

356
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:35,753
The door.

357
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:40,760
- The door.
- Right, yes. The door.

358
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:42,746
I forgot that's a thing with you.

359
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:47,622
Good luck getting anyone here
to talk to you.

360
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:51,087
She's right.

361
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:53,757
How are we gonna get people
to talk to us?

362
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:03,401
Let me guess. You've got a idea
that shouldn't work on paper,

363
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:05,518
but ultimately proves
to be reasonably successful?

364
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:11,232
So, how long you been members?

365
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:14,152
This is just a trial membership.

366
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,978
We only belong
to the most exclusive clubs.

367
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,427
- I had no idea psychics did so well.
- Most don't.

368
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:20,724
- Some do.
- Many try.

369
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:21,951
- Few can.
- I have.

370
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:25,121
Since we've been here,
everyone's been talking about Clayton.

371
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,837
- It's heartbreaking.
- Plain and simple.

372
00:19:30,658 --> 00:19:31,461
Come on.

373
00:19:32,123 --> 00:19:34,589
He was one of the best
hedge fund managers around.

374
00:19:35,236 --> 00:19:38,173
One of the only guys showing
a positive return in this recession.

375
00:19:38,298 --> 00:19:41,573
Which is why we put up with
some of his more eccentric behavior.

376
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:42,748
To a point.

377
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:49,229
Let's keep things interesting.
$1,000 a hole?

378
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,597
Sure, why not.

379
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:53,608
You guys bet like this often?

380
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,159
Sometimes we actually play
for high stakes.

381
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:02,992
I'm actually getting a reading
on both of you gentlemen right now.

382
00:20:03,438 --> 00:20:04,244
Sorry.

383
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,163
I know it's your thing, but I don't go
for that psychic mumbo-jumbo.

384
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:11,459
What I'm seeing is that sometimes
you play for obscenely high stakes.

385
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:15,004
Like the private plane
that Warren Clayton crashed and died in.

386
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,650
All right. That's pretty good.

387
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:20,468
I lost the jet to Clayton
in a skins match a couple months ago.

388
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,179
Now, that must have made you
pretty mad.

389
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:24,287
Sure.

390
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:26,751
But before anybody goes
and gets the wrong idea,

391
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:28,768
I was in Europe
when Warren's plane crashed.

392
00:20:29,623 --> 00:20:31,614
Like I told the cops,
last time I spoke to Warren,

393
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:34,732
he was planning on using the plane
to travel more with his family.

394
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:37,610
He even got a private hangar
down at the airport for them.

395
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:46,112
That means everyone in his family
had access to that plane.

396
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:53,111
This is what I figure. I figure

397
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:55,499
someone in Warren Clayton's family
got to that plane

398
00:20:55,624 --> 00:20:57,917
and sabotaged it before he took off.

399
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:01,708
Which means we have to get down
to that private hangar and look around.

400
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,160
- Let's go.
- Wait.

401
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:05,789
Don't you think you should check in
with Abigail first?

402
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:08,972
- Why? I'm not on parole.
- You told her you'd call.

403
00:21:09,097 --> 00:21:12,020
You can't be your lackadaisical self
in this relationship.

404
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,145
Abigail is the kind of girl
that needs a certain amount of effort.

405
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,170
"Relationship Shawn"
needs to step up his game.

406
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:21,513
First of all,
there is no "Relationship Shawn"

407
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:23,058
or "Boyfriend Shawn."

408
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:26,366
There's just Regular Shawn
and Malibu Shawn. You know that.

409
00:21:26,491 --> 00:21:29,491
Besides, I was with her this morning.
What am I supposed to check in about?

410
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:31,873
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I'm not talking about that.

411
00:21:31,998 --> 00:21:34,994
- I'm talking about relationships.
- How do you know about this stuff?

412
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,483
- A player always knows, Shawn.
- Please.

413
00:21:40,485 --> 00:21:42,185
- Man, hold on.
- Fine.

414
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:51,799
<i>This is a surprise.
What's the matter?</i>

415
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:54,774
Nothing's wrong.
I'm just calling to check in.

416
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,098
<i>Coffee's ready.</i>

417
00:21:56,223 --> 00:21:57,223
Hold on.

418
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:59,525
Was that my dad's voice?

419
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:01,227
I'm at your dad's.

420
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:04,760
I thought we agreed.
No pressure.

421
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:06,699
<i>Yes, I said I wouldn't pressure you.</i>

422
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,336
So I set it up myself.

423
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:11,271
And it's been very interesting,
to say the least.

424
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,709
What did he do?
Did he fire a weapon?

425
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,376
- Tell me he didn't bait a hook.
- He's been a lot of fun.

426
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,461
You wanna see how far I can spit?

427
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,047
All right, that's it.
I'm coming over there right now.

428
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:23,492
No need.
We're just wrapping up.

429
00:22:23,617 --> 00:22:26,594
But we're making plans for us
to have dinner sometime soon.

430
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:29,946
Great. That's...

431
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:32,225
That's great. I can't wait.

432
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:34,639
<i>I gotta go. Bye.</i>

433
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,895
Why didn't you tell me
to check in sooner?

434
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,220
Please, Shawn.

435
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,959
If someone asks what we're doing here,
what are we gonna say?

436
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:51,314
This is an airport, Shawn.
We can't sniff around.

437
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:55,081
- I don't want to end up in Guantanamo.
- Gus, don't be principal and interest.

438
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,541
I already have plan.

439
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:59,335
Hello sir.
We are here for our 2:00 appointment.

440
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:01,741
Is one of you guys Gus?

441
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:04,132
- Appointment for what?
- It's a flight lesson.

442
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,634
I'll be right with you.

443
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:08,919
Go with it.

444
00:23:09,044 --> 00:23:10,948
Distract him
while I take a sniff around.

445
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:13,145
Who made the rule
that I've to be the distraction?

446
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,587
- Do you know what you're looking for?
- I'll know it when I see it.

447
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:19,155
It's not that pebble.
When you're finished, I'll need you

448
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,116
to teach me everything you've learned
about how a plane works.

449
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:23,294
Don't worry.

450
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:25,570
Flying is just like driving a car.

451
00:23:26,757 --> 00:23:29,834
- It's not like that at all.
- You see that? You're gonna be fine.

452
00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:33,507
I need you to sign this waiver.

453
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,982
Here, here, here.

454
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,898
Here, here, here, here, and here.

455
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:42,024
Also a copy of your driver's license
and insurance...

456
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,339
Dude, this is sweet.

457
00:23:46,656 --> 00:23:48,384
I'll meet up with you
after you land.

458
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:42,220
I'm ready for my lesson now.

459
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:44,065
You already had it.
We just landed.

460
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:46,572
I'm ready for my lesson now.

461
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:50,279
Let me ask you a question.

462
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,462
How long does it take
to refuel a twin-engine plane?

463
00:24:52,587 --> 00:24:53,741
20 minutes, half-hour.

464
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:57,245
Hey, buddy.

465
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,455
Nobody had access
to the new plane but Clayton.

466
00:24:59,944 --> 00:25:01,550
And here's a new wrinkle
in the case:

467
00:25:01,675 --> 00:25:04,365
guess which dead billionaire
took a four-hour stop

468
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,462
that wasn't
in the official flight log?

469
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:09,671
So why would Clayton
spend four hours in Bakersfield?

470
00:25:09,796 --> 00:25:11,217
I'm ready for my lesson now.

471
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:12,510
Yeah, you are.

472
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,382
And what time did you pick him up?

473
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:25,071
Thank you, Wayne.
You've been very helpful.

474
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,234
All right. After calling
every car service in Bakersfield...

475
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,610
- Two.
- I found the one that took Clayton

476
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:33,990
- to the airport.
- So your hunch was right.

477
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,741
He went someplace else
while he was there.

478
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:38,266
Gus, note to self.

479
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:40,278
Remember 1600 Joshua Lane.

480
00:25:40,403 --> 00:25:43,104
You can't give me your note to self.
It's a note to yourself.

481
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:44,329
Fair enough.

482
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:47,104
At that moment,
Shawn found himself alone,

483
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:48,898
unable to face the journey ahead.

484
00:25:49,023 --> 00:25:51,057
You can't do
your own omniscient narration either.

485
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,718
Let's see
what's at 1313 Mockingbird Lane.

486
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:56,721
That's the Munsters' house.
It was 1600 Joshua Lane.

487
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,598
Thanks, note to self.

488
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:02,224
Thanks, jules.

489
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:05,855
So Juliet traced the address
to an environmental watchdog agency.

490
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,423
It's a nonprofit run
by a Mrs. Thomas.

491
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,197
How's that legislation
on the emissions credits coming along?

492
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,421
Why would Clayton come here?

493
00:26:16,546 --> 00:26:17,644
Mrs. Thomas?

494
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,647
- May I help you?
- I certainly hope so.

495
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:24,272
My name is Shawn Spencer.
This is my associate, Jazz Hands.

496
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,770
Does the name Warren Clayton
mean anything to you?

497
00:26:28,817 --> 00:26:29,967
Come with me.

498
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,099
We're investigating the circumstances
surrounding Mr. Clayton's death.

499
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:37,011
We believe
he may have been murdered.

500
00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:40,389
That's karma for you.
You guys believe in karma, don't you?

501
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,725
Yes, we do. But only
because we are karma chameleons.

502
00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:44,393
We come and go.

503
00:26:45,524 --> 00:26:47,330
My psychic sensors led me here.

504
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:48,455
And I am

505
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:51,734
getting traces
of Warren's meta-essence.

506
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:52,902
Here.

507
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,237
There.

508
00:26:54,756 --> 00:26:56,739
And, somewhat shockingly,

509
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,943
- right there.
- Well, that's uncanny.

510
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:02,218
If only you were as attuned
to environmental issues.

511
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:05,869
Sorry.

512
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:09,210
I always forget which one is mine,
so I just open a new one.

513
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:12,944
I like the little clicky-clack sound
it makes when you...

514
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:17,551
- That one didn't do it.
- Yes, Warren did come visit me.

515
00:27:18,424 --> 00:27:21,013
We talked business for a few hours,
and then he left.

516
00:27:21,313 --> 00:27:24,016
Later I saw that he was dead.
I couldn't believe it.

517
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,933
You talked business? He didn't seem
like the environmental type.

518
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:27,895
He wasn't.

519
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:32,273
This company's been at odds with him
ever since my husband and I started it.

520
00:27:33,246 --> 00:27:36,569
- He must be seven feet tall.
- That's a Masai tribesman.

521
00:27:36,885 --> 00:27:39,170
Charles is standing
right next to him.

522
00:27:39,295 --> 00:27:41,190
Shawn, you're wasting paper.

523
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:43,139
Rain dance.

524
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:45,299
Seriously, do you mind?

525
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,165
You know what they say about a man
with a large carbon footprint?

526
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,544
Please ignore him.
So why did Mr. Clayton come see you?

527
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,981
He wanted my endorsement
in a business move that,

528
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,356
let's just say I didn't approve of.

529
00:27:58,215 --> 00:28:01,554
When I refused, things got heated.
But I'm used to Clay's temper.

530
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,599
<i>So many memories of Clay.
That's what I called him.</i>

531
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,937
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm Charles.

532
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,814
And I'm Shawn Spencer,
and this is...

533
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,984
Don't forget to schedule that lunch
with councilman Prather.

534
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:17,409
Sure thing.

535
00:28:19,629 --> 00:28:21,240
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

536
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,018
I think you should've stuck
with the Masai guy.

537
00:28:26,143 --> 00:28:28,831
What? They would've had
caramel babies with 30-inch verticals.

538
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm sorry. We have to go.
Thank you for your time.

539
00:28:38,523 --> 00:28:40,634
- Happy?
- You can't recycle food, Shawn.

540
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:43,804
- How many rules are there?
- Pretty much just that one.

541
00:28:48,232 --> 00:28:50,182
Now I kind of want to eat it.

542
00:28:52,817 --> 00:28:53,810
Let's go.

543
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,694
There's something
she's not telling us.

544
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,614
Did you see how she changed the subject
when her husband came around?

545
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,992
Plus she called Warren "Clay,"
which is what his wife called him.

546
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,137
Sounds like Mrs. Thomas is more
than just a business acquaintance.

547
00:29:08,262 --> 00:29:10,074
Sounds like
she's another filthy mistress.

548
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:13,026
And she fits Warren's type.
She's all headstrong, hot in a...

549
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,378
female DA
or detective on <i>Law & Order</i> sort of way.

550
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:16,837
Like Milena Govich?

551
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,155
- Like an Angie Harmon.
- Like Mariska Hargitay?

552
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,467
Exactly. Which explains
why the meeting got all heated.

553
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,762
<i>In fact, before he died, he tried
to be the man that I once loved.</i>

554
00:29:26,127 --> 00:29:27,223
<i>Katie Erbe?</i>

555
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:28,723
Dude.

556
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:32,065
I think Warren was trying
to reconcile with his wife.

557
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,647
And I bet Ms. Green Jeans in there
wasn't too happy about it.

558
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,982
- Sounds like motive.
- We gotta get Lassie on this.

559
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,943
We need to get out of this office.

560
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,679
Take your time reading it, okay?

561
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:44,654
Because it's going to be...

562
00:29:45,373 --> 00:29:48,279
Are the police still wasting
valuable time on your little theory

563
00:29:48,404 --> 00:29:51,288
- that one of us is a murderer?
- Yes. About that.

564
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,542
I did get
a few of my psychic signals crossed.

565
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,540
But what is not important,
Mrs. Clayton,

566
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:59,681
- is who accused who of "partricide."
- You mean patricide.

567
00:29:59,806 --> 00:30:01,424
- What's that?
- Killing a partridge.

568
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,131
- It's a victimless crime.
- No.

569
00:30:03,256 --> 00:30:05,102
- Who's the victim?
- The partridge.

570
00:30:05,733 --> 00:30:07,012
Here's what's important.

571
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,928
I have identified
the culprit responsible

572
00:30:10,053 --> 00:30:12,768
for your husband's untimely death.
Your family is off the hook.

573
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,688
Finally. So who is it?
Who is responsible for this atrocity?

574
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,443
Another gold-digging,
yet far less exotic...

575
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:23,028
- mistress.
- Mr. Spencer's theory was confirmed

576
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,581
when we found out your husband
had recently changed his will.

577
00:30:25,706 --> 00:30:26,706
What?

578
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,453
Upon his death, the bulk of his estate
is now going to the great green hope.

579
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:33,460
Plus forensics confirmed that
the plane's altimeter was tampered with,

580
00:30:33,585 --> 00:30:36,141
and our suspect had her pilot's license,
which means she knew enough

581
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:38,377
to sabotage the controls.
It's enough for a warrant.

582
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:40,503
Thank God.

583
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,286
Very impressive.

584
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:46,218
I'm glad my initial instinct
about you was correct, Mr. Spencer.

585
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,132
There's our suspect. Let's go.

586
00:30:50,257 --> 00:30:51,308
Stop right there.

587
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,267
- Hands behind your back.
- What is going on?

588
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:56,271
Can't believe she showed up
at the will reading.

589
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,647
- Who does she think she is?
- My daughter?

590
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,607
My sister?

591
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,524
Who are we talking about?

592
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,862
Nyna Thomas,
you have the right to remain silent.

593
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:04,987
Let's go.

594
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,115
<i>That's my daughter, Nyna.
She's no longer with us.</i>

595
00:31:28,925 --> 00:31:30,971
I can't believe you think
I would kill my own father.

596
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:33,724
In my defense, I initially thought
you were sleeping with him.

597
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,780
How pumped are you
that I was wrong about that?

598
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,815
But you called him "Clay"
instead of "dad" or "father".

599
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:45,945
I stopped calling him "dad" years ago
when I denounced our way of life.

600
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:49,072
Okay, then why were you so uncomfortable
when your husband came into the room?

601
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:50,772
Because I try to keep my past

602
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:52,826
 from interfering
with my new life with Charles.

603
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:56,372
Then we can all agree
that this is completely your fault.

604
00:31:58,396 --> 00:31:59,833
When Warren came to visit me,

605
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,802
to tell me some story
about how he'd changed

606
00:32:01,927 --> 00:32:04,452
and he wanted to reconcile,
I promptly told him to kiss off

607
00:32:04,577 --> 00:32:06,223
and keep his dirty money.

608
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,552
But now that he's dead, I can't help
but wish I'd given him a second chance.

609
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:13,389
Listen, Nyna's a saint. And that's why
she didn't mention the money at first.

610
00:32:13,772 --> 00:32:16,141
What else have you failed
to mention, Nyna?

611
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:20,456
Well, I didn't think
it was important at the time,

612
00:32:21,476 --> 00:32:23,107
but now I realize that it might be.

613
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,576
I overheard my dad arguing
with one of his golf buddies.

614
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:30,281
Something about a problem
with one of his investments.

615
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,448
Golf buddies?

616
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,831
- So, what can I do for you boys?
- Mr. Wiswall,

617
00:32:39,264 --> 00:32:41,625
you told us that you hadn't spoken
to Warren Clayton for months.

618
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:44,152
Then I had a vision of an argument.

619
00:32:44,277 --> 00:32:46,171
Something about investments,
returns.

620
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,632
Capital...

621
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:50,676
gains. That's a...
That's a thing, right?

622
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:53,762
No flies on you.

623
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:56,062
I'm afraid that's only the tip
of the iceberg.

624
00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:58,183
- You see, I'm also seeing...
- Wait, wait.

625
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,546
All right, all right.

626
00:32:59,671 --> 00:33:01,527
Let me just set the record straight.

627
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:05,115
Just before Warren died,
I called him, livid,

628
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:07,473
about money missing from my account.

629
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:09,451
He then confessed to me

630
00:33:09,576 --> 00:33:12,656
that his billion-dollar hedge fund
was a giant Ponzi scheme.

631
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,812
Stop right there.

632
00:33:13,937 --> 00:33:16,800
I simply refuse to believe that Henry
Winkler had anything to do with this.

633
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:20,148
Wait. If that were the case, the S.E.C.
ever found out, that would mean

634
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:22,682
Clayton would be on the hook
for hundreds of millions of dollars.

635
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:24,632
And his investors would be left
with nothing.

636
00:33:24,757 --> 00:33:27,379
- Including yourself.
- He'd already lost all my money.

637
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,674
I had to sell my house,
liquidate all my assets.

638
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,010
Christ, I'm living in a hotel.

639
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,683
No one knows,
because I've just been...

640
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:39,099
keeping up appearances
around the club.

641
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,464
- Please, continue.
- I was determined

642
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:43,929
to get my money back
one way or another, so...

643
00:33:44,364 --> 00:33:46,106
I called Clayton
the night before he died.

644
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,396
I asked him to
at least return the plane.

645
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:50,944
Then I could sell it
for $5 million or so.

646
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,974
The bastard
wouldn't even agree to that.

647
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,992
Not even when I threatened
to make an anonymous tip to the S.E.C.

648
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,870
Who else knows
about this alleged Fonzie scheme?

649
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:02,447
No one that I know of.

650
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:05,342
I kept all the falsified documents.
Boxes full.

651
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:07,169
In case I needed proof.

652
00:34:08,903 --> 00:34:11,799
I'm sensing you won't have
to hold onto them for much longer.

653
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,973
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.

654
00:34:21,098 --> 00:34:23,865
Abby and I were just talking
about my time as a detective.

655
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,233
I'm actually surprised
that you never applied to the academy,

656
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,525
especially since you're kind
of doing the same thing.

657
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,735
We don't really need
to get into that, do we, dad?

658
00:34:32,022 --> 00:34:33,644
I trained him
to be a real detective.

659
00:34:33,769 --> 00:34:36,031
He wanted to be
a professional ass-wipe instead.

660
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,080
Well, dad, the wipe doesn't fall
very far from the ass.

661
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:42,371
Tree. And it used to bother me
when you say things like that.

662
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,109
But not anymore.
You know why?

663
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:47,928
Because I discovered that no matter who
you are or what family you come from,

664
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:50,170
fathers and their children
rarely see eye to eye.

665
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:54,046
Shawn, I think that you and your father
would communicate better if you...

666
00:34:54,171 --> 00:34:55,422
Trap-caught prawns.

667
00:34:55,547 --> 00:34:57,561
- Sounds sad.
- Right, no fixing.

668
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,265
I'd really love to hear
Abby's perspective on all this.

669
00:35:03,713 --> 00:35:04,763
Sweetheart?

670
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:10,265
I think your father would be able
to better respect your decisions

671
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,277
if the two of you were able
to share more of your emotions.

672
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,280
- He's not really the sharing type.
- It's worth a shot.

673
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,026
Really, you're gonna pretend

674
00:35:18,151 --> 00:35:20,951
like you've had an emotion
since <i>Walker, Texas Ranger</i> got canceled?

675
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,910
At least
I'm willing to give it a try.

676
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:25,332
Okay, all right.
Try this on for size.

677
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:28,459
You've been in a horrible,
fiery plane crash.

678
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:32,045
You're clinging to life.
All of your organs on the inside...

679
00:35:32,528 --> 00:35:33,505
Pancaked.

680
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,009
You have 15 seconds to live.

681
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:38,454
What message do you want to get to me,
your only son, before you die?

682
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,565
- I'm not gonna...
- Go.

683
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,931
- I'm not gonna answer.
- See what I mean?

684
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,202
It's a little harsh to talk
about him being in a horrible crash.

685
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:47,644
You see?
What'd I tell you?

686
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:49,263
Excuse me.

687
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,024
{\Wiswall's turning
over his Ponzi evidence.}

688
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:54,049
Perfect timing.

689
00:35:54,174 --> 00:35:56,195
{\Lassie & Jules on the way.
Get 2 his hotel now!!!}

690
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,795
Text from Gus.

691
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,507
Major break in our case.

692
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,183
I have to go.

693
00:36:02,665 --> 00:36:05,325
Dear Abby, Dr. Phil, enjoy.

694
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:07,909
Dr. Phil is bald.

695
00:36:09,687 --> 00:36:11,335
- Doesn't even fit.
- You're not bald,

696
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,539
you're just taller than your hair.

697
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:20,862
You'd better not
be wasting our time.

698
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:23,086
Yeah, the case against Nyna
is really strong.

699
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,309
Prepare yourselves.

700
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,772
I'm about to bust open
a brand-new angle on this case,

701
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:29,186
including brand-new motifs.

702
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,313
- Motives.
- Like fraud. Embezzling-ment.

703
00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:34,191
And sub-prime time toxic assets.

704
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:42,833
- That's a thing, right?
- You are a child.

705
00:36:52,124 --> 00:36:53,502
Don't touch anything.

706
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:02,761
- He's dead.
- Man, why does this always happen?

707
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,013
We have to start checking first.

708
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,365
Possible homicide down
at Carlyle hotel.

709
00:37:10,594 --> 00:37:11,988
What's a prospectus?

710
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:13,563
Investment records.

711
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:22,471
That must be the registration number
for Warren Clayton's hedge fund.

712
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,076
Whoever killed Wiswall must have taken
the evidence with them.

713
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:31,398
Good news.

714
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:33,959
I think I know
where they're going next.

715
00:37:42,149 --> 00:37:44,553
They're probably only here
for the photo ops.

716
00:37:51,975 --> 00:37:53,125
It's typical.

717
00:37:57,545 --> 00:37:59,940
- Dearly beloved...
- I think Mr. Clayton would've wanted me

718
00:38:00,065 --> 00:38:02,362
- to spread his remains.
- Okay, Shawn, that's enough.

719
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,429
You only spoke to him for,
like, 30 seconds.

720
00:38:04,554 --> 00:38:06,855
- He didn't even know your name.
- We were beyond names.

721
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:10,287
If anyone close to Warren Clayton
would like to say a few words?

722
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,581
What...
What do you think you're...

723
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:17,202
Warren Clayton
is communicating with me.

724
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,922
Take your hands off of my husband!

725
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:21,965
From in here.

726
00:38:24,757 --> 00:38:25,594
Dust...

727
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:28,680
in... the wind.

728
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:32,050
All we are is dust...

729
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,770
in...

730
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,405
What are you doing?

731
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:44,603
You killed Warren Clayton.

732
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,571
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

733
00:38:47,907 --> 00:38:49,608
Makes perfect sense to me.

734
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:52,912
Nyna wanted nothing to do
with her father's money. You did.

735
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,499
<i>I know what Nyna said.
And I'm begging you to reconsider.</i>

736
00:38:56,216 --> 00:38:57,919
<i>We could do so much with that money.</i>

737
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,865
Warren refused to reconsider.

738
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,221
He was gonna change
his will back to its original form

739
00:39:02,346 --> 00:39:04,071
when he returned home the next day.

740
00:39:04,196 --> 00:39:07,594
That is precisely when you set
your dastardly plan into effect.

741
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:11,431
Like your wife, and apparently
everyone else in this family,

742
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,017
you have extensive knowledge
of aircraft-ery.

743
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:20,273
I can see the alti-meter
in the wreckage of Warren's plane.

744
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,569
- Alti-meter?
- Altimeter.

745
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,737
Altimeter.

746
00:39:26,055 --> 00:39:28,365
And the elevation
is off by 1,200 feet.

747
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:32,577
This means it was tampered with.

748
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:37,874
You caused the crash.

749
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:41,086
And so warren Clayton died,

750
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,880
before he could take your nonprofit
organization out of his will.

751
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,718
And you thought you were in the clear.
Until...

752
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:49,126
Garvin.

753
00:39:50,143 --> 00:39:51,847
- What?
- Come on, dude.

754
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,723
Yeah, I get it.
It was that guy.

755
00:39:54,054 --> 00:39:57,171
Until you heard about warren's argument
with his golf buddy, Chad Wiswall.

756
00:39:57,702 --> 00:40:01,706
Knowing that Wiswall was going to blow
the whistle on the Ponzi scheme,

757
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,329
thus freezing Mr. Clayton's assets,

758
00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:06,445
you went ahead and clubbed him too.

759
00:40:07,978 --> 00:40:09,436
This is ridiculous.

760
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:10,824
Nyna, tell him.

761
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:14,119
Is that why you disappeared for hours
after my father left?

762
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,789
And why you were shredding paper
last night?

763
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:24,129
Sweetie.

764
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,840
You deserved the money.
We deserved it.

765
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,943
We could've done so much good...

766
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:33,680
Officer, hold this man
until detectives Lassiter

767
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,563
and O'Hara arrive on the scene.

768
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:38,226
Here, take this.
My work is done.

769
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:43,315
Please.

770
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,184
- No need to thank me.
- That's not for you.

771
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,917
This is still a funeral, son.

772
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,701
Of course.

773
00:40:56,931 --> 00:40:58,531
- Good job.
- Thanks.

774
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:03,135
I think I breathed in some dead guy.

775
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,803
<i>Ground ball to second.</i>

776
00:41:07,928 --> 00:41:09,883
<i>Davis has it.
Throw to first...</i>

777
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:12,552
Come on in. Have a seat.
Just watching the game.

778
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,870
All right. About last night.

779
00:41:16,494 --> 00:41:18,475
Let me be the first
to apologize for my behavior.

780
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,490
Considering the fact that
we've never tried to kill each other,

781
00:41:21,615 --> 00:41:24,397
I'm willing to admit that our family is
not as messed up as I thought we were.

782
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,359
All right, very cool. Very cool.
Apology accepted.

783
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,441
And you know, you asked me
that question at dinner the other night,

784
00:41:31,566 --> 00:41:34,074
he one about
if I only had 15 seconds left to live.

785
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,700
I've got an answer for you.

786
00:41:35,874 --> 00:41:37,661
I'd want to tell you that...

787
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,663
Well, I'd do my best to express...

788
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:41,873
Look, what I want you to know...

789
00:41:43,254 --> 00:41:45,335
- Wait, wait...
- That's it, pop. You're dead.

790
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,816
I'm closing your eyelids.
I'm taking off your watch,

791
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:51,091
putting that thing on craigslist.

792
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,567
Just wanted to say I love you.
