1
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:05,742
All right, Shawn,

2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:08,424
now, the most important thing
about playing second base

3
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:09,554
is the footwork.

4
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:11,636
- You ready?
- I was born ready, dad.

5
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:14,485
Actually, you were born breech, son.
Took hours to get you out.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,431
Ball.

7
00:00:16,223 --> 00:00:18,052
But I appreciate the enthusiasm.

8
00:00:18,177 --> 00:00:20,686
All right, let's give it a try.
Here we go. Get those feet going.

9
00:00:21,049 --> 00:00:22,146
Come on, get low.

10
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:23,315
Attaboy.

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,941
That's it.

12
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,989
- That was great.
- I just did what you said.

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,491
That was perfect, son.

14
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:34,867
Hit me another one.

15
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:36,036
You got it.

16
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:38,952
This time we're gonna try
a few new things.

17
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,305
Stay low, just like you did.
That was good.

18
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,930
This time take your left foot,
you're gonna point it toward the bag.

19
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:46,034
Keep your right foot firmly planted
in the ground.

20
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,615
You're gonna aim for the lower part of
the first baseman's glove

21
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,634
while calibrating the number of steps
before the runner gets there. Got it?

22
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:53,344
I think so.

23
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:54,934
All right, here we go.

24
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:56,059
Get low.

25
00:01:16,187 --> 00:01:17,387
Big win today.

26
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:18,937
Big win.

27
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:20,663
Big win for the team.

28
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:21,999
Isn't that right, buzz?

29
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,683
Well played, all of you.

30
00:01:23,895 --> 00:01:26,110
Let us not forget
that our valiant opponents

31
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:28,161
also played a heck of a ballgame.

32
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:30,840
Respect, haircut hut.

33
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,510
Cheers!

34
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:37,388
I don't know
why you're giving that victory speech.

35
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:40,141
- You almost cost us the game today.
- What? I had five hits.

36
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:42,143
You also overthrew first base
five times.

37
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:47,398
All right, look. I know
you're all thinking it, so here it goes.

38
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:51,569
I am suffering from a mental block.
It goes all the way back to my youth.

39
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,459
It's common
amongst highly skilled athletes

40
00:01:54,584 --> 00:01:56,350
and international men of leisure.

41
00:01:57,449 --> 00:02:00,035
- They call it the "yips".
- They should call it the "sucks".

42
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:04,323
Wait, wasn't there that guy...
What's his name?

43
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,699
Yes. Former Yankee second baseman
Chuck Knoblauch.

44
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:09,116
All of a sudden...

45
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:11,706
he committed an unprecedented number
of throwing errors,

46
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,095
one of which sailed...

47
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,634
into the stands and hit
Keith Olbermann's mother in the face.

48
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,053
- That's awful.
- Don't worry, Jules, I'm getting help.

49
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:22,036
I just recently started
seeing a sports psychologist,

50
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:25,394
and I'm happy to report that I'm already
seeing marked improvement.

51
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,855
- Five errors is an improvement?
- Could have been ten.

52
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,607
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

53
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:36,370
Where's my food?

54
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:37,495
Excuse me,

55
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:40,117
I still haven't gotten
my pizza chili cheese fries...

56
00:02:40,456 --> 00:02:43,507
Also known as the Shawn Spencer.
Not that you'd recognize them as such,

57
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:45,924
seeing as how this establishment
refuses to call them that,

58
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:48,397
even though I order them
six times a week.

59
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:50,127
I brought you the fries, sir.

60
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,797
If you'd brought them to me,
I think I'd know

61
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,965
'cause I'd be experiencing
both euphoria

62
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,676
and a burning sensation
in the neighborhood of my colon.

63
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:01,764
- Do you want to speak to my manager?
- I don't want to, I demand to, Jenny.

64
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,720
We will discuss
both the name of the dish

65
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:07,697
and the method in which it is expedited.
This guy behind...

66
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:11,189
Excuse me, I'm afraid we have...

67
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:17,477
Can I help you with anything?

68
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:21,467
Hold that thought.

69
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:25,221
Sorry.

70
00:03:25,842 --> 00:03:28,094
Lassie, we may have
a real sort of serious problem.

71
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,551
Guys, you shouldn't have.

72
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,293
Come on.
You didn't think we'd forget.

73
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,284
Upgrade that to an emergency.

74
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:48,394
That guy by the door has a gun.

75
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,724
We need to make a plan. There's
a Louisville slugger on the wall.

76
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:56,610
I'm gonna crack the glass, use it.
Some of us aren't packing.

77
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:57,893
Move.

78
00:03:58,875 --> 00:03:59,875
Police!

79
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,532
Freeze, douche bag!

80
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:13,540
What have we got?

81
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:14,902
What we've got

82
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:17,590
is a white male,
medium build, about 5'10".

83
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,168
Attempted armed robbery.

84
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,939
A few shots exchanged
between the perp and myself

85
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:24,388
before he escaped out
these doors here.

86
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:26,242
Looks like more than a few.

87
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:27,907
I was rounding.

88
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:31,890
O'Hara, expand the perimeter search.
I want this bastard found.

89
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:36,091
Thank you, chief.
I'll take it from here.

90
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:37,403
All right, people,

91
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,808
we all went through
a terrible ordeal today.

92
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,572
Not only were we almost killed,
chief,

93
00:04:42,946 --> 00:04:46,660
- I never got my pizza.
- But setting that aside for a second...

94
00:04:47,018 --> 00:04:49,914
Mr. Spencer, unless you have something
that will help this investigation,

95
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,874
I suggest you shut the hell up.

96
00:04:57,987 --> 00:04:59,965
I think I do have something, chief.

97
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,186
I'm getting some serious voodoo

98
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:04,469
that the hooded man didn't come
to rob the restaurant.

99
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,055
Then what was he doing?

100
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:08,223
He wanted to kill someone.

101
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,643
Wanted to kill someone?
Who?

102
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:12,883
One of us.

103
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,526
Psych 405
"Shawn Has the Yips"

104
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,670
Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

105
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,745
I don't have time for this.

106
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,903
Fact: the hooded guy
came into the restaurant

107
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:12,434
to kill someone at our table.

108
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:14,893
Fact: he failed,
which means he'll probably try again.

109
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:17,127
Fact: if I can figure out
who he was targeting,

110
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,934
it'll probably give us insight
as to the hooded man's identity.

111
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:22,506
Those aren't facts.
At best they're a stab in the dark.

112
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,124
A stab in the dark?

113
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,587
Fact: that's a pretty good name
for a horror flick.

114
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:28,762
Remind me to include it
in this letter to Wes Craven.

115
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,848
I don't know why.
He never reciprocates.

116
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,766
Maybe against his will.

117
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,768
That doesn't make any sense, Shawn.

118
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,896
- The statements from everyone.
- Great. I'll look at them.

119
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,483
Your hypothesis is crap. Who walks
into a known cop bar to kill a cop?

120
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:42,944
- It makes no sense.
- Fact.

121
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,253
You say that word again,
I'll punch you in the face.

122
00:06:45,378 --> 00:06:48,130
Truth: there was only $42
in the cash register.

123
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:50,701
He's right. The manager
verifies it in his statement.

124
00:06:52,283 --> 00:06:54,329
Who walks in and tries to knock off

125
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,291
a known cop bar for $42?
That doesn't make any sense.

126
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,002
He's a lowlife whacked out on junk.
I've seen it many, many times.

127
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:04,086
- Dad.
- Thank god you're okay.

128
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:05,568
I'm fine. What's up?

129
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,970
I saw the shooting on TV.
I've been trying to call you.

130
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,667
It's been going to voice mail.

131
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,222
I've been worried to death.

132
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:15,017
I forgot to turn on my phone.

133
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,020
Let me ask you something. What did you
do right after the shooting?

134
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:19,901
I called my folks
to tell them I was okay.

135
00:07:20,026 --> 00:07:22,524
- And what was the first thing he did?
- He ate a banana.

136
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,797
- You ate a banana?
- I sure did. You know why?

137
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:28,614
Because it makes me think of you,
'cause you're my big ol' papa monkey.

138
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:32,618
I need to see everyone
who was present at the shooting.

139
00:07:33,147 --> 00:07:35,030
That's us. Gotta go.
Thanks for coming by, dad.

140
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,032
- Gus, am I overreacting?
- No.

141
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:39,232
We're not done here, Shawn.

142
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,216
Since you were involved
in an armed robbery attempt

143
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:44,904
and subsequent shooting,

144
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:47,896
per department policy,
Dr. Erlich is here to offer counseling

145
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:49,218
to anyone who wants it.

146
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,767
If no one needs
to speak with Dr. Erlich...

147
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,463
Okay, let's get back to work.

148
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:04,900
Excuse me.

149
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:11,091
I didn't want to show weakness
in front of the rest of the group,

150
00:08:11,216 --> 00:08:12,950
but I could use a little counseling.

151
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,046
There's no shame in asking for help.

152
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:18,372
- You can use the conference room.
- Right.

153
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:21,416
Do I have to use
the department's psychologist?

154
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:25,837
- Not technically.
- 'Cause I'd like to call in my own guy.

155
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:30,173
- This is a sports psychologist.
- Yes, I know.

156
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:33,387
Dr. Manny is fantastic,
and he's helping me with the yips.

157
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:36,351
I'm not using public funds
to help you

158
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,767
overcome your mental block
of overthrowing first base.

159
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,767
Would it help
if I told you I'm also pee-shy?

160
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,812
Chief?

161
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:46,413
CSI found these
in the alley behind the sports bar.

162
00:08:47,113 --> 00:08:48,427
Room 16.

163
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:50,052
The downtowner motel.

164
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:52,304
This matches
the shooter's sweatshirt.

165
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:55,118
Which he probably ripped while escaping,
and the key fell out.

166
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,327
There's a damn good chance
that he's at this location.

167
00:08:57,452 --> 00:08:59,241
- I know this place. Let's go.
- I'll drive.

168
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:01,846
No need. I finally got my car back
from the shop. It's perfect time.

169
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:04,918
I am gonna ask you to sit
on a towel, though. No offense.

170
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:07,053
Why would I be offended by that?

171
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,135
I don't know what we're gonna find here.
The shooter's back at the motel.

172
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,477
Gus, don't be the ribs
that flip over Fred Flintstone's car.

173
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,877
I know you're not completely sold
on my hit man theory,

174
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:23,862
but I need you
to suspend your disbelief

175
00:09:23,987 --> 00:09:25,927
and hop on board
the streetcar named <i>Shawnsire</i>.

176
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:28,025
You know how that metaphor
makes me uncomfortable.

177
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:34,615
- I knew it.
- What?

178
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,576
I knew there was something about that
guy that didn't scream "junky thief."

179
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,204
He was wearing a $5,000 watch.

180
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,148
And I know his socks were 80 bucks

181
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:44,348
'cause I just ordered some
with your Nordstrom's card.

182
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:46,084
I told you to stay out of my wallet.

183
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:49,054
Like you're not gonna be happy
when you get those points.

184
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,754
- I got it.
- You know who the hit man was after?

185
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,878
No, I know what happened
to my pizza chili cheese fries.

186
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:01,308
That dumpy catcher
from the haircut hut got them.

187
00:10:01,505 --> 00:10:03,762
Now there's a purple-haired
lesbian running around

188
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:05,750
with dyspepsia that should be mine.

189
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,272
I'll be in the car.

190
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,525
- Gus, freeze!
- What?

191
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:15,643
Excuse me.

192
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,541
Where would I find the monitor
that goes with that surveillance camera?

193
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:23,205
Under the hostess stand. But the cops
already took the tape from the day.

194
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:25,256
I'm not interested in the tape.

195
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,497
Can I move now?

196
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:32,925
Exactly two steps to your right.

197
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:47,228
That guy's a lot smarter
than Lassie gave him credit for.

198
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,664
Check it out.

199
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:49,606
What?

200
00:10:52,156 --> 00:10:53,556
He knew exactly where to stand

201
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:56,364
so that surveillance camera
wouldn't pick him up.

202
00:10:57,183 --> 00:11:00,833
Why would someone so intelligent
carelessly drop their motel room key?

203
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,800
They wouldn't...

204
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:03,925
Unless...

205
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:05,455
It was a dummy lead.

206
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,800
Juliet confirmed it.
The shooter wasn't at the motel.

207
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,188
Lassiter still thinks
this guy's a junky thief,

208
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:21,680
so he's combing the area
in case the perp saw them and took off.

209
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:24,766
Yeah, I figured I'd need more
to convince Lassie.

210
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:27,162
That's why I've completely
restaged the crime scene

211
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,112
with stand-ins
where each of us were sitting.

212
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:31,523
This way I can figure out
who the shooter was targeting.

213
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,775
Let me guess.
I'm the pepper, you're the salt.

214
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:36,111
Juliet's the sugar,
Lassiter's the lemon,

215
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,403
McNab's the cherry...

216
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,283
- Mashed potatoes? Really?
- This is actually kind of fun.

217
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,536
- Did you scoop out the last lesbian?
- Just tell me what you got.

218
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,630
All right, we know that the shooter
held his position at the door

219
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:50,876
- for exactly 26 seconds.
- And we know this how?

220
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:53,711
Because that's how long
it takes to sing happy birthday.

221
00:11:54,793 --> 00:11:56,383
I got the singing, Shawn.

222
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:04,279
<i>Upgrade that to an emergency.</i>

223
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,327
I know who he was after.

224
00:12:50,263 --> 00:12:52,824
- Seriously, how's Lassie?
- Not good.

225
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:55,593
- Oh, man.
- Yeah, I've never seen him this bad.

226
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,444
This son of a bitch
destroyed my car.

227
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,363
Calm down, Carlton.
At least you're okay.

228
00:13:01,576 --> 00:13:04,699
- You should count your blessings.
- Shawn's call kept you from being hit.

229
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:08,147
Jules, it's not important
that it was me that saved Lassie's life,

230
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:10,896
or that I was right, or that he should
have listened to me from the start

231
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:12,791
because I was right.
The important thing

232
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:16,211
is that you're unharmed, and that it was
because of me and I was right.

233
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,463
Do you know how much
the city gonna pay to fix this?

234
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,081
Are you asking Shawn the psychic,

235
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:22,634
or Shawn the guy who worked
for a couple afternoons at a Meineke?

236
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,678
Do you have any idea
who'd want to shoot you?

237
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,771
A lot of people want to kill me.
I take great pride in that.

238
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:30,767
Spencer, are you getting any vibrations
on who that might be?

239
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:35,667
Chief, the psychic universe
is echoing Lassie's sentiments.

240
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,066
He has so many enemies,
it literally could have been anyone.

241
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,902
- His landlord. His mailman.
- His ex-wife. Bigfoot.

242
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,571
Okay, we'll start with someone
that Lassiter busted.

243
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:46,023
Okay, but that only eliminates Bigfoot.
By the way,

244
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,952
little-known fact: bigfoot...
He only wore a size ten.

245
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,662
I need ballistics
on the shooter's gun and details

246
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,665
on its vantage point
when he fired on Lassiter.

247
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,463
All right, since I'm point on this,
you pull all my old case files,

248
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:58,462
start going over them.
I'm hitting the streets.

249
00:13:58,631 --> 00:13:59,796
You're staying put.

250
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:06,051
No, I can't have my lead detective
on the street with a target on him.

251
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:09,806
Okay, so I'll organize things
from here.

252
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,637
I also can't have
any appearance of bias

253
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:14,853
or a conflict of interest
in this investigation.

254
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:16,980
O'Hara, you're taking over as point.

255
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:19,968
I'll assign someone the field work,
you go over the old cases.

256
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,844
Spencer, I need you to get
any readings you can from the evidence.

257
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:26,239
And I want you kept
in this room under 24-hour guard.

258
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,157
What?

259
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,193
Sorry about this, partner.

260
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:36,920
The frozen yogurt guy's out front.

261
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:38,606
Did you want to go get one?

262
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:39,753
Wait, you can't.

263
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,392
These cases offer the most promise.

264
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,269
In each of them the perp threatened
physical harm against Lassiter.

265
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,855
- All right, let's dig in.
- Are you looking at Palermo?

266
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,151
- Don't forget about Palermo.
- We won't.

267
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,731
- How'bout Fletcher?
- Him too.

268
00:15:11,337 --> 00:15:13,164
Hold that up a little higher
so I can see it.

269
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:14,788
This isn't gonna work.

270
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:16,873
What?

271
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:25,799
Much better.

272
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:26,859
Absolutely.

273
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:28,609
We're just missing one thing.

274
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:29,803
Yeah, pizza.

275
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:32,964
I was going to say an immersion
therapy tank and hallucinogens,

276
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:35,225
- but I could go for a slice.
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

277
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,851
I'll call Luigi's. They deliver.

278
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,536
They deliver hallucinogens?
That doesn't seem legal, does it?

279
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,064
Where's the cordless phone?

280
00:15:41,363 --> 00:15:43,024
- Why me?
- You always lose it.

281
00:15:43,364 --> 00:15:45,239
No, I don't lose it.

282
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:47,529
I place it somewhere
that later eludes me.

283
00:15:47,982 --> 00:15:49,197
That's the same thing.

284
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,741
Maybe to those of us
without the nuance chromosome.

285
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,826
What?

286
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,765
Maybe instead of arguing about it,
we should actually look for it.

287
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:00,168
Whose elliptical is this?

288
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:04,345
Why don't you take a look at our bodies
and judge for yourself.

289
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:06,630
Gus, when did you get it?

290
00:16:08,857 --> 00:16:10,666
Why don't you take
a look at 'em in a month,

291
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,054
when I'm ripped to the bone,
have an eight-pack.

292
00:16:13,477 --> 00:16:15,890
Possibly nine. Tall boys.
You can play my abs like a harp.

293
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,062
He never uses it.

294
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,167
I just joined a gym, and I got
into this incredible fitness regimen.

295
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:23,074
It's all about self-motivation.

296
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,151
If you want me to teach you some
of the tricks my trainer taught me...

297
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:29,760
No thanks. I'm not really into the whole
motivational Tony Robbins thing...

298
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:31,196
I prefer his brother Baskin.

299
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,845
Hello, Mrs. Garcia.

300
00:16:58,209 --> 00:16:59,601
Is your husband available?

301
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:01,648
I see.

302
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:04,097
Would you please give him
a message for me?

303
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,253
This is detective Carlton Lassiter.

304
00:17:06,837 --> 00:17:08,914
Let that fat bastard know

305
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:11,837
that I know that he's the one
trying to kill me,

306
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:15,134
and if he wants to tangle, baby,
my dance card is wide open!

307
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,230
I see.

308
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:22,613
I am very sorry
for your loss, ma'am.

309
00:17:22,738 --> 00:17:25,417
I actually had an uncle with coronary
disease, so I understand...

310
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:30,298
I can't find that phone anywhere.

311
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:32,676
I guess we're having doritos
for dinner.

312
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:35,267
You say that like it's a bad thing.

313
00:17:40,612 --> 00:17:43,046
{\Drug lord released
Petrovich Ivan}

314
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:47,877
Vibrations piercing through
from the other side.

315
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:51,549
Person of interest, possible shooter,
just released from prison.

316
00:17:51,674 --> 00:17:52,674
Ivan...

317
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:55,363
Petrovich.

318
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,176
I was just reading that guy's file.

319
00:17:57,301 --> 00:17:59,351
He's some sort of drug lord
or something.

320
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:00,494
Where is it?

321
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:01,927
Here it is.

322
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,167
- That's weird.
- What?

323
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:08,795
Our names are listed on the case,
but we didn't work on it.

324
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,588
And yet we got paid for it.

325
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,841
- I was never paid for it.
- Maybe we didn't.

326
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:15,692
- Did you or did you not get paid?
- I don't know, Jules.

327
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,763
I'd have to check some files,
crunch some numbers, place some calls.

328
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,105
- You took money, but you did nothing?
- I answered the phone,

329
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,806
and it was the chief,
which technically makes me a consultant.

330
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:27,355
Was it a misdial? Maybe.
Why are we splitting hairs?

331
00:18:27,744 --> 00:18:30,984
Ivan Petrovich isn't just a drug lord.
He's the worst kind.

332
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:33,945
He targets high school kids.
Remember that quarterback that od'd?

333
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,348
- It was in the newspaper.
- I only read the <i>London financial times</i>

334
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:39,451
and <i>dog fancy</i>.

335
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:52,505
Oh, boy.

336
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:55,956
I officially feel guilty.

337
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:58,582
I'll return the $500, plus interest.

338
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:00,770
I'll apologize to the family and...

339
00:19:00,895 --> 00:19:03,557
I'll do the thing in the box
with the guy in the... thing.

340
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:04,893
Confession?

341
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:08,081
I need to get back to the station
and tell Vick about Petrovich.

342
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:09,647
Enjoy your doritos.

343
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,805
That's a bummer.

344
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,775
Should we start trying
to track this guy down?

345
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:16,196
The sooner we do, the sooner Lassie
isn't sequestered at the station.

346
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:20,033
It could wait till tomorrow.

347
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,525
I remember Petrovich.

348
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,282
He's the worst kind of scum
that there is.

349
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:31,075
All right,
I'm putting an APB out on him.

350
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:35,173
Why is my speakerphone on?

351
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,802
Chief, I demand to be the one
to bring in Petrovich.

352
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,887
He was listening in
on our conversation?

353
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:43,777
Chief, my partner has the right to know
who tried to kill him.

354
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,280
All right, this one is personal.
Petrovich is a monster.

355
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:51,022
That one family whose lives he destroyed
when their son od'd on his poison...

356
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:54,275
During his trial, he turned around
and winked at them.

357
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,336
- I remember as well as you do.
- And all I was able to get him on

358
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:00,490
is a weapons charge. Now, that has
eaten me up for three years.

359
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:01,848
That's not your fault.

360
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:04,202
You got him on what you could,
and we've all been there.

361
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:07,033
Look, I have to think
about your safety.

362
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:08,877
This man is hell-bent on revenge,

363
00:20:09,002 --> 00:20:11,042
and he's targeting the one officer
who put him away.

364
00:20:13,024 --> 00:20:14,880
I didn't work that case alone.

365
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,257
McNab was there
when I busted petrovich.

366
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,216
- Where's McNab?
- He's off duty.

367
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:24,264
I'll run the search on Petrovich.
O'Hara, give McNab a call,

368
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,600
just to make sure that he's okay.
Better yet, go by his place.

369
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,437
I'm sorry. Officers, please.

370
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:37,110
This is ridiculous.

371
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:44,246
Damn it!

372
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:50,357
Come on, McNab.

373
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,500
Go around back.

374
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:02,427
Thank God.

375
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,548
I was just in the shower.
What's up?

376
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:06,317
Ivan Petrovich
tried to kill Lassiter,

377
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,474
you were in on his arrest,
he's threatened you too.

378
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,137
That guy's the devil.

379
00:21:10,262 --> 00:21:12,203
For your safety,
Beckett is gonna stay with you.

380
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:14,325
I'm gonna check back
in a little while, okay?

381
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,100
- Nice robe.
- Thanks.

382
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:18,276
I'm just gonna grab my mail.

383
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,308
Go on in.
I'll make us some eggs.

384
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:36,461
- How bad is he?
- <i>He's stable.</i>

385
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:39,286
Looks like he's gonna be fine.

386
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:42,133
Luckily, it was a crude device.

387
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:45,504
<i>It was rigged to go off the second
the mailbox key was turned.</i>

388
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:48,692
<i>The blast blew him into the pool
and probably saved his life.</i>

389
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:51,684
Hell.

390
00:22:02,258 --> 00:22:04,906
- This is Burton Guster.
- Gus, thank God you're all right!

391
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:06,658
Juliet?

392
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,406
Looks like Petrovich may be targeting
everyone who was on the case,

393
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:10,620
which includes you.

394
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:13,289
But...
we didn't actually work on the case.

395
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,625
Somehow
Petrovich may have seen the file.

396
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,377
<i>Have you talked to Shawn?</i>

397
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:27,025
What are you doing?

398
00:22:31,578 --> 00:22:34,378
"If your heart rate
drops below 150, you die"?

399
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,373
The bomb squad is on its way.

400
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,483
How did you figure
this was booby-trapped?

401
00:22:57,608 --> 00:22:58,608
I saw...

402
00:22:58,951 --> 00:23:01,386
that Petrovich went after McNab
on the local news.

403
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:03,111
I put it all together.

404
00:23:03,554 --> 00:23:05,466
I can't believe
we're being targeted for a case

405
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,051
that we never worked on.

406
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,770
- At least we got paid for it.
- Really?

407
00:23:09,895 --> 00:23:12,205
I'm starring
in the elliptical version of <i>Speed</i>,

408
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,752
and you're guilting me?

409
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:15,768
It's more like <i>Lethal Weapon 2</i>.

410
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,229
Where Danny Glover found
the bomb attached to his toilet.

411
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,247
God, I would kill
to be on a toilet right now.

412
00:23:25,914 --> 00:23:28,833
- I'm not gonna die on this thing?
- Don't think like that, Shawn.

413
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,922
Whatever happens,
I'll be right here.

414
00:23:31,415 --> 00:23:33,073
Where the heck are they?

415
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:37,665
- I'm really tired.
- Wait, wait. No, no.

416
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,334
Just hang in there, Shawn.
They'll be here any second now.

417
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,169
Look, I just...

418
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:45,089
I just gotta say...

419
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:46,674
that...

420
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:50,553
I know.

421
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,723
I got $800 for the Petrovich case.

422
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:55,249
Not $500.

423
00:23:56,824 --> 00:23:58,024
I forgive you.

424
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,522
Shawn, are you all right?
Where's the bomb?

425
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,450
- Down there.
- Why are you exercising?

426
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,312
If his heart rate
drops below 150, he's toast.

427
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:09,781
My God, I wrote this note.

428
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,575
- What?
- I left it for Shawn as a motivator.

429
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:15,411
I do the same thing.
It's a trick my trainer taught me.

430
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,914
What kind of sick trainer
have you been working with?

431
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,333
Wait a second,
so what is the beeping, blinking thing?

432
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:31,803
We're idiots.

433
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:35,181
Will you...
Please make it stop.

434
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:37,492
Thank God.

435
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:58,431
Go.

436
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:02,875
- Go back.
- All right.

437
00:25:04,484 --> 00:25:05,461
Watch my back.

438
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,207
Enough!

439
00:25:15,332 --> 00:25:18,641
If Petrovich knew you were listed,
he would've already made a move.

440
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,352
Now, man up and let's go.

441
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,327
- We're cool.
- We're men.

442
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,731
Get down!

443
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,751
Everybody's good?

444
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:31,847
Everybody's good.

445
00:25:37,045 --> 00:25:39,036
It's McNab.
I didn't know he was out yet.

446
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,538
Buzz, buddy!

447
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:42,623
Hey, guys.

448
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,412
That bomb did a number
on your eyebrow.

449
00:25:45,537 --> 00:25:48,087
- Blew it clean off.
- Amazing. Just the brow.

450
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,381
It's okay.
I've still got one good one.

451
00:25:51,353 --> 00:25:52,550
How are you feeling?

452
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,261
The doctors say I have a concussion,
but I fine feel.

453
00:25:56,336 --> 00:25:59,807
- Plus I've lost parts of three toes.
- That's terrible, man.

454
00:26:00,107 --> 00:26:02,518
What's going on with you?
You have a tickle in your throat?

455
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,419
- No, I'm just a little dehydrated.
- Jeez.

456
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:09,602
Here I am, going on and on
about losing toes

457
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:12,361
and getting blown 20 feet,
and you're dying of thirst.

458
00:26:12,691 --> 00:26:14,947
- Let's get you some water.
- Buzz, I can get it.

459
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,324
It's okay, I...

460
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,343
You stay here.
You know, do whatever you want.

461
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,088
I had a killer workout this morning.

462
00:26:32,094 --> 00:26:33,799
All right, everyone, listen up.

463
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:35,644
As most of you know,

464
00:26:36,357 --> 00:26:39,558
Ivan Petrovich is back on the streets,
and he's targeting

465
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:40,533
our own.

466
00:26:40,658 --> 00:26:42,892
And this morning he went after
officer McNab with a bomb.

467
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:47,104
Bringing in Petrovich
is our number one priority.

468
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,482
And the person
who I've put in charge,

469
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:52,068
despite my concern for his safety,

470
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:55,571
is the man who knows Petrovich
more than all of us combined.

471
00:26:56,768 --> 00:26:58,618
Detective Carlton Lassiter.

472
00:26:59,187 --> 00:27:00,493
Big dinger! Lassie!

473
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:03,955
Thank you, everyone.
It's good to be back on the case.

474
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,375
I've made up a list of all the places
I think Petrovich might be hiding.

475
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,850
They're being passed out.

476
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:11,754
I want each location surveilled
or checked out immediately.

477
00:27:12,478 --> 00:27:15,209
You've all been assigned
an individual team,

478
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,282
which you'll find
in the lower right hand corner.

479
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:19,136
- Excuse me.
- What? What is it?

480
00:27:19,758 --> 00:27:21,889
Shawn Spencer here.
I'm having a psychic vision.

481
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:24,948
It's of a place
that's not on your list.

482
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:26,811
Martin's Foogoo Chair.

483
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,022
Sonny and Cher...

484
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,817
Lair.
Martin's Lair of the White Worm.

485
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:35,489
Martin's... Shoe Repair?

486
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:39,743
That's a phony business
Petrovich used for his drug trade.

487
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,365
He wouldn't be hiding there.
It's the size of a phone booth.

488
00:27:45,662 --> 00:27:47,248
There's an extra room.

489
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,141
There's more to that place.

490
00:27:49,266 --> 00:27:51,877
This is a very strong hit.
I think it's worth checking out.

491
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:56,842
Why don't you stop by?

492
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:59,427
Fine.
You ride with O'Hara and I.

493
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,902
The rest of you, let's get on it.
We've got work to do.

494
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,871
- There's nobody in here.
- That's a shame.

495
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:19,697
I was hoping Daniel Day Lewis'd be here
to fix the rip in my tretorns.

496
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,741
The man cobbles.

497
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,951
I knew this was a waste of time.
Let's go, O'Hara.

498
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,550
Daddy's getting something.

499
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,875
Oh, yeah,
he's definitely getting something.

500
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:33,961
I'm sensing there's an extra room
attached to this place.

501
00:28:34,365 --> 00:28:35,565
A secret room.

502
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:38,489
We just have to find the secret...

503
00:28:40,993 --> 00:28:42,193
It's not this.

504
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:49,017
But what do we have here?

505
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,911
Shawn, you might want
to let this go.

506
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:06,486
What is this thing?

507
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:09,413
Look, there's gotta be
like a secret lever or...

508
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,623
Let's go.

509
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:17,888
Did you guys hear that?

510
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,633
It sounds
like Petrovich has a dead spot.

511
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:22,885
Move that table.

512
00:29:27,528 --> 00:29:30,017
It's weighting like a entire tree.

513
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,120
I'm going down there.

514
00:29:57,783 --> 00:30:00,033
I know you're down here, Petrovich.

515
00:30:04,312 --> 00:30:05,771
Why didn't we stay up?

516
00:30:05,896 --> 00:30:08,596
I told you...
I get freaked out by tassels.

517
00:30:29,124 --> 00:30:30,124
I got him.

518
00:30:41,836 --> 00:30:42,985
Look at that.

519
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:45,176
- Lassie's getting some press.
- Good for him.

520
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:47,101
He deserves it.

521
00:30:47,577 --> 00:30:49,444
50 $ to the guy
wo can get on camera the most.

522
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:50,735
You're on.

523
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:55,728
How does it feel to have taken out
one of SB's most notorious drug lords,

524
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,396
a man
who was personally targeting you?

525
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:01,777
I'm happy that particular piece
of scum is off the street.

526
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,802
Let's just leave it at that.

527
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:07,031
Describe the moment for us.
Were you scared?

528
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,999
I don't get scared, Linda.

529
00:31:09,527 --> 00:31:11,160
He reached for his gun,
and I reacted.

530
00:31:15,385 --> 00:31:17,208
You should ask Petrovich
that question.

531
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:19,585
I can't. He's dead.

532
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:21,561
Right.

533
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,798
- So what's next, detective?
- Well, there's still...

534
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,116
Knock it off!

535
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,607
<i>There's still work to be done,</i>

536
00:31:33,732 --> 00:31:37,042
<i>but I am gonna take the time to visit
some of the members of our community</i>

537
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:39,414
<i>who were most affected by Petrovich.</i>

538
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,732
It's gonna feel pretty good
to give them this news.

539
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:43,543
There it is.

540
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:44,777
And here it comes.

541
00:31:47,803 --> 00:31:48,656
And...

542
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,216
wait for it.

543
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:52,755
- Wait for it...
- <i>I don't get scared, Linda.</i>

544
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:57,665
- 4 and half seconds. I win.
- There's no way.

545
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,220
Sorry, Gus.

546
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:00,696
The watch...

547
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,540
does not lie.

548
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,175
Doritos, i'll never get sick of you.

549
00:32:09,322 --> 00:32:11,427
You have to admit,
Lassiter stepped up big today.

550
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,138
Yeah, I guess.

551
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:16,554
- Do you not agree?
- I don't know.

552
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:19,478
Don't you think
there was something weird?

553
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:23,023
Lots of things were weird.
Like your irrational fear of tassels.

554
00:32:23,424 --> 00:32:25,067
- Irrational?
- Yes.

555
00:32:25,594 --> 00:32:27,528
What purpose
do tassels serve on shoes?

556
00:32:27,982 --> 00:32:30,072
- I don't know.
- I do. Evil.

557
00:32:32,402 --> 00:32:35,661
I'm sorry.
There's still something bugging me.

558
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,707
You want me to do
a little armchair psychology on you?

559
00:32:40,853 --> 00:32:43,085
- No, I do not.
- I think you're jealous of Lassie.

560
00:32:43,552 --> 00:32:46,102
I'm happy to admit
that Lassie succeeded.

561
00:32:46,661 --> 00:32:49,633
Really? Then why did you just put
"succeeded" in air quotes?

562
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:51,056
Okay, fine.

563
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,329
Lassie did great today.

564
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,599
- There, you happy?
- I would if you really meant it.

565
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,083
Lassie...

566
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,070
did great today.

567
00:33:00,513 --> 00:33:02,675
- Lassie did great today.
- Oh, God.

568
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,272
- Lassie did great today.
- You know what...

569
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:07,299
- Today...
- Rewind his interview.

570
00:33:07,424 --> 00:33:08,574
I'm retiming.

571
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:15,623
<i>An exclusive interview
with the detective</i>

572
00:33:15,748 --> 00:33:18,848
<i>who single-handedly took out
notorious drug boss...</i>

573
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,540
What are you doing?

574
00:33:26,683 --> 00:33:28,172
The shooter had no scar.

575
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:30,883
- I take it all back.
- What are you talking about?

576
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:32,990
- Look at Petrovich's left hand.
- What?

577
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:34,386
Just look at it!

578
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:36,874
You see that scar?

579
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,098
Yeah. So?

580
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,601
So Petrovich
wasn't the guy in the bar.

581
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,437
Why haven't you been picking up?

582
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:44,813
We didn't hear the...

583
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,126
This is charging.

584
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:51,904
This is not.
What's wrong with you?

585
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,131
I don't know
why this give me so much trouble.

586
00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:56,499
I just saw
the coroner's report on Petrovich.

587
00:33:56,624 --> 00:33:59,495
He had already been dead
for two hours before we got there.

588
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:01,792
- Lassiter shot a dead guy?
- Sounds about right.

589
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:05,209
So whoever's targeting
Lassiter and McNab is still out there.

590
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,345
- How did he die, by the way?
- Drug overdose. A major one.

591
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:12,083
They found giant amounts of PCP, heroin,
and methamphetamine in his system.

592
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:12,972
Damn.

593
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:16,212
The guy's in prison for three years.
He gets out and then ods?

594
00:34:16,337 --> 00:34:18,494
Did the coroner's report
say anything about

595
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:21,183
him being restrained,
or abrasions on his body?

596
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:23,352
He had rope burns on his wrists.

597
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:28,857
Petrovich didn't kill himself.

598
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:31,902
Someone tied him up
and forced the drugs on him.

599
00:34:42,022 --> 00:34:43,942
Was Lassiter serious
when he wanted to reach out

600
00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:46,333
to members of the community
whose lives were affected?

601
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,960
He's been doing it all day. Why?

602
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:51,088
I think he's in serious trouble.

603
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,124
Mr. Salamatchia.

604
00:34:57,124 --> 00:34:58,554
Thanks for meeting me here.

605
00:34:59,194 --> 00:35:00,128
Of course.

606
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,850
- Would you mind?
- Of course not, sir.

607
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:05,185
I have some great news,
if you haven't heard already.

608
00:35:08,659 --> 00:35:10,109
What would that be?

609
00:35:14,622 --> 00:35:18,210
Okay, thanks. Let me know.
There's still no word from Lassiter.

610
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:20,451
And they checked Salamatchia's home
but there's nobody.

611
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,327
He was special ops, twice decorated.

612
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,287
- Any other addresses listed for him?
- He owns a restaurant across town.

613
00:35:25,412 --> 00:35:26,498
What's the address?

614
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:30,210
Today is the anniversary
of his son's death.

615
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:32,466
I know where they are.

616
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:41,743
So it was you this entire time.

617
00:35:41,868 --> 00:35:43,706
I'm sorry, sir, I just don't get it.

618
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:47,477
Petrovich pumps drugs into our schools,
and my son ends up dead,

619
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,855
and you lock him away
on a guns charge?

620
00:35:50,225 --> 00:35:52,470
That's my definition
of not getting it.

621
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:53,745
Put 'em down.

622
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:57,851
Look...

623
00:35:58,152 --> 00:36:01,133
The gun charge was all
I could get him on at the time.

624
00:36:01,258 --> 00:36:03,936
I wanted him off the streets.
What am I supposed to do?

625
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,920
Poison him.

626
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:07,899
Blow him up.

627
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:10,851
Make him dead.

628
00:36:11,183 --> 00:36:12,383
That's murder.

629
00:36:16,022 --> 00:36:17,257
That's justice.

630
00:36:20,693 --> 00:36:21,595
I'm a soldier.

631
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:24,693
I've killed people whose muddy boots

632
00:36:25,136 --> 00:36:27,486
Petrovich wasn't
good enough to lick.

633
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:30,296
His death,

634
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:31,896
and yours,

635
00:36:32,477 --> 00:36:33,977
is just my way of...

636
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:37,392
bringing things back into balance.

637
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:39,196
You see my point.

638
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:41,867
What I see is a decent man

639
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:44,243
whose grief has driven him
to the breaking point.

640
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,621
Don't pretend that you feel
something for me, please.

641
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,739
I've given the better part of my career
chasing the Petroviches of the world

642
00:36:50,864 --> 00:36:52,459
because of people like you.

643
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:56,587
I understand the pain
that he's put you through.

644
00:36:57,372 --> 00:36:59,091
I've lost my only child,

645
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,592
gone through a divorce.

646
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,810
Just what the hell do you know?

647
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,310
Mr. Salamatchia...

648
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:07,224
Sorry, detective.

649
00:37:08,702 --> 00:37:09,434
Freeze!

650
00:37:12,582 --> 00:37:13,355
Drop it!

651
00:37:15,007 --> 00:37:17,507
You drop it
or I'll kill him right now.

652
00:37:19,394 --> 00:37:20,279
Now!

653
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,783
Please tell me one of you
is carrying a weapon.

654
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:26,703
Weapon? No.

655
00:37:27,401 --> 00:37:28,203
Wait.

656
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:32,061
It's just... It's just this.

657
00:37:32,186 --> 00:37:33,625
You are unbelievable.

658
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:36,253
It's okay.
It's totally out of range.

659
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,215
- I recognize you.
- Yes, sir.

660
00:37:41,275 --> 00:37:43,899
- We're listed on the Petrovich case.
- No, we are not.

661
00:37:44,024 --> 00:37:45,596
- I'm not gonna lie.
- Since when?

662
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,180
No, I saw you in the bar.

663
00:37:48,448 --> 00:37:50,916
I know everything there is to know
about that case.

664
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:52,441
You weren't on it.

665
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:55,147
- One time.
- What?

666
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:57,274
<i>Get those feet going. Get low.</i>

667
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,525
<i>Get low. Attaboy.</i>

668
00:38:00,722 --> 00:38:01,528
One time.

669
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,996
Damn it.

670
00:38:21,308 --> 00:38:22,132
Good work.

671
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,511
Great work, Lassie.

672
00:38:26,926 --> 00:38:29,401
Did you just throw
our cordless phone into a tree?

673
00:38:29,526 --> 00:38:32,607
A man's life was hanging in the balance.
It was clearly our only move.

674
00:38:32,732 --> 00:38:34,686
You're buying us a new phone, Shawn.

675
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:38,441
Your mind is not an opponent, Shawn.

676
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:40,281
It's a teammate.

677
00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:43,788
A teammate that's there for you
in good times and bad.

678
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:47,127
You may not always get along...
It may be moody...

679
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:49,531
Wear your shower sandals
without permission.

680
00:38:49,656 --> 00:38:51,556
But never doubt its loyalty.

681
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:54,247
So when I roll this ball to you,

682
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:56,901
I want you to scoop it up

683
00:38:57,026 --> 00:38:59,507
and deliver a perfect strike,

684
00:39:01,161 --> 00:39:02,711
knowing all the while

685
00:39:02,952 --> 00:39:05,300
that your teammate
is pulling for you.

686
00:39:15,651 --> 00:39:16,651
I did it.

687
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:19,984
I'm over the yips. What?

688
00:39:20,229 --> 00:39:23,318
I knew you could do it, Shawn!
I'm so proud of you!

689
00:39:29,189 --> 00:39:30,839
Little long on the hug.

690
00:39:31,617 --> 00:39:33,036
Thank you, though, doc.

691
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:35,956
My pleasure.
You still want me to bill chief vick?

692
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:39,501
Yeah, but we're calling this
"trauma therapy."

693
00:39:39,936 --> 00:39:40,929
Will do.

694
00:39:41,887 --> 00:39:42,987
See ya, Gus.

695
00:39:44,742 --> 00:39:46,092
That's it, buddy.

696
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:48,260
I'm back
to being a five-tool player.

697
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:50,459
Call me Tori Hunter,
but do it in the jamaican accent.

698
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:52,684
Me said 'em call me tori hunter.

699
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:55,217
Can we now go to Kingston's
and get some jerk chicken?

700
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:56,990
- I'm starving.
- Let me get the stuff.

701
00:39:57,115 --> 00:39:59,104
Your treat too.
You still owe me for those socks.

702
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,230
You still owe me
for your whole life.

703
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,967
You know what they say
about athletes and mental blocks?

704
00:40:07,092 --> 00:40:08,238
Don't even try it.

705
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:10,057
I'm not trying anything.

706
00:40:10,182 --> 00:40:11,709
I'm just stating the fact

707
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:14,231
that most athletes find that
when they get over one mental block,

708
00:40:14,356 --> 00:40:16,371
it shows itself
in another part of their game.

709
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,096
For example, hitting.

710
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:21,877
You trying to go Hannibal Lecter on me?
Are you out of your mind?

711
00:40:22,748 --> 00:40:25,672
This is one
unflappable element of my game.

712
00:40:28,012 --> 00:40:30,052
- You want me to throw it at you?
- Serve one up.

713
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:33,013
You bring that little tater over here.
You bring that little tater tot.

714
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,950
Gimme another one.

715
00:40:48,725 --> 00:40:49,863
Put it in here.

716
00:40:51,935 --> 00:40:52,935
Die!

717
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:02,726
Dr. Manny!

718
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:05,153
Could you come back, please?

719
00:41:07,169 --> 00:41:08,568
All right, come on.

720
00:41:08,693 --> 00:41:09,993
Bring that meat.

721
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:14,304
Damn it!
