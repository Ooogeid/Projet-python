1
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:10,334
That was your teacher.

2
00:00:10,459 --> 00:00:13,511
Apparently, you were the only one
who didn't turn in his art assignment.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,097
So there's going to be an empty space
on the wall at open house tonight.

4
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:20,672
Actually, dad,
I'm pretty sure I did finish it.

5
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:22,716
It sounds to me like it was stolen.

6
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,055
So somebody

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,858
breaks into the school, and the only
thing they steal is your painting?

8
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:28,280
Why's that?

9
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:29,860
Because it's the perfect crime.

10
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:32,071
Sit.

11
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,964
Shawn, there is no such thing
as a perfect crime.

12
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:45,066
We leave in 45 minutes.

13
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:46,627
Make something pretty.

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,254
Is your hair starting its own cult?

15
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:00,767
Trying to do a performance review here.
I thank you not to bother us.

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,145
That seems like a strange thing to thank
me for, but you're welcome, of course.

17
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:07,773
And now, as a show of gratitude, how
about a little advance on our next case?

18
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,276
You're not an actual employee
of the police department.

19
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,904
Define "actual",
wait, define "police", wait...

20
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,906
I'm not giving you
an advance on a case

21
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:17,366
that may or may not happen
in the future.

22
00:01:19,237 --> 00:01:21,216
Perhaps I know something you don't.

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,665
Let's be honest. It's not like crime
is going to suddenly stop, is it, Gus?

24
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:26,959
Seems very unlikely.

25
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,795
- Out.
- So that's a no on the advance.

26
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:31,733
Pardon me for asking the obvious
question, but how are you out of money?

27
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,670
You have no possessions
and no expenses.

28
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:35,721
- That's mostly true.
- That's completely true.

29
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,513
But Gus and I also have
a big ski vacation planned.

30
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:39,781
Ski vacation?

31
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,214
Mr. Spencer,
it's the middle of summer.

32
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:44,393
Where are you gonna find snow
at this time of year?

33
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,003
- Are we ever gonna start skiing?
- Soon as I finish this hot chocolate.

34
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:57,323
- Why don't you just throw it out?
- I would,

35
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,192
but this hot cocoa represents
the end of our vacation money.

36
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:02,754
How are we out of cash?
We've only been here four hours.

37
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,380
The American dollar was not
as strong as I anticipated, Gus.

38
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:08,198
Which is why I had to put
the whole thing on a credit card.

39
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:09,837
You don't have a credit card.

40
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,421
I said a credit card,
not my credit card. It's your card.

41
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:15,683
That's why I'm being so aggressive
about getting the money to pay you back.

42
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:20,510
See that? A month ago I would've had us
styled up with those girls tonight.

43
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:23,170
- What?
- But I'm spoken for now.

44
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:25,476
I have Abigail, and she has me.

45
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:27,645
You have been talking about her
this whole time.

46
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:31,460
- Why didn't you bring her on this trip?
- Gus, you are my best friend.

47
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,901
Because I've entered into
some newfangled relationship

48
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,820
does not mean that our guy time...

49
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:39,866
goes by the wayside.

50
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,736
You know,
if you're gonna keep staring at girls,

51
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:44,996
you can't preach about
how committed you are to Abigail.

52
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,999
All right, first of all,
the person I'm staring at is a man.

53
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,542
He's handsome...
dimples, brooding eyebrows...

54
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:53,754
But a man nonetheless,
and I... know that guy.

55
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:56,465
You don't know that guy.
I think he's wearing $10,000 skis.

56
00:02:57,147 --> 00:02:59,561
- All you own is that hot chocolate.
- I've seen this guy before.

57
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:00,761
I can't place where.

58
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,558
<i>Well, I can play too!</i>

59
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,187
<i>I need you to like me.</i>

60
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,357
<i>He arrested Ernesto Ramon Chavez.</i>

61
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,311
Dude. You remember
when we were in Lassie's apartment

62
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:22,450
- and we saw his wall of suspects?
- When Lassiter killed that guy?

63
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,828
He didn't. We got him exonerated.
I got punched and pistol-whipped.

64
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:28,108
I'm still not sure
he didn't kill that guy.

65
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:33,336
What does the name Pierre "Des...

66
00:03:33,883 --> 00:03:37,256
per-ea-eux mean to you?

67
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:39,300
Are you in my apartment?

68
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,529
I haven't snuck into your apartment
in weeks.

69
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,387
We're all out of peanut butter.

70
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:47,224
Whatever you're up to, just stop.
No need for a psychic with an art thief.

71
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:49,644
- He's an art thief?
- No way.

72
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,214
A dangerous art thief, right?

73
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:53,814
Never been caught, never left
enough evidence to be accused.

74
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:56,468
Cut to the chase. What kind of reward
have we for catching this guy?

75
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,195
- Or an advance for catching him.
- Or a finder's fee.

76
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,489
- I'm looking right at him.
- <i>You don't do anything.</i>

77
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,199
You have no jurisdiction up there.

78
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,701
<i>You have no jurisdiction anywhere,
especially in Canada.</i>

79
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:08,795
- You're not thinking the thing through.
- You're right. With the exchange rates.

80
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,245
- We won't get the check right away.
- Ask about taxes.

81
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,250
Listen. Despereaux is mine.

82
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,670
<i>I absolutely forbid you
to do anything.</i>

83
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,005
Sorry, too late.
It's time for us to catch a thief.

84
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:26,283
So what do we do now?
Do we call the authorities?

85
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:28,109
We make sure it's Despereaux.

86
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,159
And I have an ingenious plan
to smoke him out.

87
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:31,323
Sounds good.

88
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:36,398
- That was your plan?
- Let's go!

89
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,038
Turn, turn, turn!

90
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:09,266
I think we should've taken
that second ski lesson.

91
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,245
We're doing great!

92
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:13,536
Remember what the instructor said.

93
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,772
Pizza slices to slow down.

94
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:17,900
French fries to speed up.

95
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,081
We got him.

96
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:26,367
There's only one move
we can't follow.

97
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,493
What's that?

98
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:31,372
He just made it.

99
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,916
- The slow, gentle turn?
- That was it.

100
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:57,356
You know what this means.

101
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,983
That we suck at skiing?

102
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,055
It means that this hot chocolate

103
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:03,874
just became a write-off.

104
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,763
Psych 401
"Extradition British Columbia"

105
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,052
Timing: Psych Team

106
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,115
What did this fellow's name
was again?

107
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:52,202
Pierre Despereaux.

108
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:55,012
It's 11 "o"s, I believe.

109
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:57,909
Pierre Despereaux.
E-a-u-x.

110
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:02,546
Thefts in London, Belgium,
Switzerland, South Africa.

111
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:05,391
Where'd you came across him again?

112
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,876
Ultimately we cornered him
at a resort up in Whistler,

113
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,056
but first, I sensed his presence here
in your country.

114
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:13,597
I don't follow.

115
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:16,685
Just one second, please.

116
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:19,082
Are you sure you want to do this?

117
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:21,398
Have a little faith. I've done it once.
I can do it again.

118
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,400
- We are in a foreign land.
- Not really.

119
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,570
- We went through immigration.
- Why you gotta question everything...

120
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:30,614
Here's the thing, Robert.
The thing is this.

121
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:32,470
I am a psychic.

122
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:34,510
We work for the Santa Barbara
police department.

123
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:36,374
We've solved over 47 cases.

124
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,323
I'm also a pharmaceutical rep,
if that means anything to you.

125
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:41,416
- You've seen <i>The mentalist</i>, right?
- Yes.

126
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:44,139
- It's like that.
- Except that guy's a fake.

127
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,887
If I was a fake psychic,
it would be eerily similar.

128
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:48,926
- Exactly the same.
- A virtual carbon copy.

129
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:52,895
Okay, well, now, Mr. Spencer,
you seem like a nice enough guy,

130
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,516
but you should know that there are many
here at the R.C.M.P.

131
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,590
that would be a little more skeptical
of these alternative methods

132
00:07:58,715 --> 00:08:00,912
than you're probably
used to in the States.

133
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,608
- What's he doing?
- He's having a psychic episode.

134
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,093
- It's a bit off-putting.
- You get used to it.

135
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:15,146
Hey, biking to work. I like it.
It's great for the environment.

136
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:17,286
I live a kilometer away,
but, yeah, actually.

137
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,605
It's cleaner.

138
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,748
Hey, you.

139
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,021
How's the little guy?
Is he walking yet?

140
00:08:23,318 --> 00:08:25,077
Barely. He just turned one.

141
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:26,421
Do I know you?

142
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:33,178
Robert, give me your mitts.

143
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:38,517
I'm sensing that you have
a lot of really good ideas,

144
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,769
but that nobody around here
seems to want to listen.

145
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,896
Stay the course, buddy.
You'll have your day.

146
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:45,566
I'm getting Ed.

147
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:47,999
I am getting Ed.

148
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,905
You gotta be more careful, Shawn.
This boss comes out, it's make or break.

149
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,658
No more wild guesses.

150
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:57,592
Get your socks ready, Gus,
'cause I'm about to knock them off.

151
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:58,867
What you got?

152
00:08:59,913 --> 00:09:01,498
- I got nothing. You?
- Nothing.

153
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:06,961
- I got it.
- No, you don't.

154
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,422
- Yes.
- It's obvious...

155
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,422
- Don't tell me, don't tell me.
- Shut up!

156
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,594
So, you work as a psych...

157
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:17,514
You wouldn't by chance
be celebrating

158
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,933
a birthday anniversary
any time soon, would you?

159
00:09:20,987 --> 00:09:22,311
- You kidding me?
- Yes.

160
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:28,038
That's amazing.

161
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:29,723
My birthday's today.

162
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:30,943
How'd you know that?

163
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,614
It's all right here.

164
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:38,955
<i>Hello there, constable.</i>

165
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,081
<i>This is deputy commissioner Ed Dykstra
with the Vancouver R.C.M.P. office,</i>

166
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:46,126
and I'm here with a couple fellas
you work for,

167
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:50,347
and they have some psychic information
about a Pierre Despereaux.

168
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:53,115
- You familiar with him?
- Familiar?

169
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:55,021
I've been tracking that man
for 6 years.

170
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm the closest anyone's ever
gotten to catching him.

171
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:59,939
That's terrific.
If you could just send up those files,

172
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:02,057
detective Spencer and I
would be much obliged.

173
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,436
Detective? Are you kidding me?
Despereaux is not to be messed with.

174
00:10:05,609 --> 00:10:07,646
Check with Interpol.
He's cunning and dangerous.

175
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,482
And if he is up there,
you will need my expertise on this.

176
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:13,111
I know all his patterns. I want to be
made a full partner on this.

177
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,327
I think that's something you
better run by your superior here.

178
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,248
- I don't want...
- <i>Hey there, buddy.</i>

179
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:20,244
Spencer, you listen to me,

180
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,621
<i>and you listen good.
You do not touch Despereaux.</i>

181
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,496
Wait for me.
I'll be on the next flight.

182
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,584
I sure would love to see you too,
but don't you think you should focus

183
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:30,295
on your case load? I don't think
the chief's going to approve this.

184
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,007
I have 325 days of unused vacation time.
I will see you in five hours.

185
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:40,180
Chief, little favor to ask.

186
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:50,036
Do you believe that? A high-ranking
member of the U.S. law enforcement

187
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:51,995
not being allowed
to carry his weapon on him?

188
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,820
Did you really think
it wouldn't set off the metal detector?

189
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,760
I've got to get my hands on a gun.
I have enemies everywhere.

190
00:10:57,885 --> 00:10:59,946
- Maybe I can pick one up at the hotel.
- Absolutely.

191
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:02,479
Right downstairs in the gift shop.
They have kleenex, mixed nuts,

192
00:11:02,604 --> 00:11:04,304
and 9-millimeter lugers.

193
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:08,254
- Thanks for letting me use your miles.
- Thanks for bringing me along.

194
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:10,230
Otherwise,
you wouldn't let me use your miles.

195
00:11:10,355 --> 00:11:11,543
It was really sweet.

196
00:11:14,026 --> 00:11:15,026
What?

197
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,882
See taxi to False Creek.

198
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,147
We're not here on a sightseeing mission.
We are here on official business!

199
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:21,178
Got you.

200
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,425
It is business.

201
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,576
Looks like Despereaux
already made his first strike.

202
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:25,766
It's a crime scene.

203
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:37,195
Can I help you?

204
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,059
Listen, Dudley, I'm detective Lassiter
and this is my partner, O'Hara.

205
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:41,283
We're from the SPBD.

206
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:44,119
You work for Mr. Shawn Spencer.

207
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,829
Sorry.

208
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,578
So sorry. I've been instructed
not to let anyone in

209
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:51,834
without checking
with head detective Spencer first.

210
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,892
- This is a joke, right?
- Brace yourself, guys.

211
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,800
He never steals a single item.
It's always, always multiples.

212
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,343
That's directly
from my report... Spencer!

213
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,924
Don't interrupt the head detective
when he's working.

214
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,808
The ions are specifically
concentrated here

215
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:10,335
and here.

216
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,023
Crime ions.
Write that down.

217
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,905
- This is Mr. Lassiter...
- Detective.

218
00:12:25,335 --> 00:12:27,579
And his partner, Juliet O'Hara.

219
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:29,617
They are from Santa Barbara.

220
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,833
Welcome aboard.
Glad you made it okay.

221
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:34,142
You look...

222
00:12:35,265 --> 00:12:36,562
normal and stuff.

223
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,172
I got nothing.

224
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,716
This is Mr. Stockwell,
owner of the necklace in question.

225
00:12:41,148 --> 00:12:43,553
Well, Mr. Stockwell.
May I call you Gibby?

226
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:46,555
- My first name is Randolph.
- I've heard it both ways.

227
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,974
How's he doing?

228
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:50,747
- He's been better.
- Let me start by saying,

229
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:52,352
let us not cry over spilled syrup.

230
00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:54,439
Honestly,
it's a little silly for a man

231
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,732
of your stature to wear
a necklace like this.

232
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,944
- What are you talking about?
- The necklace

233
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:03,031
is an authentic Edwardian
baroque caliber-cut piece.

234
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:05,365
It has never touched human skin.

235
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:08,328
It is worth $3.5 million.

236
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,331
What are we talking?
Canadian dollars?

237
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:18,837
He stole something else too.

238
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:20,172
He stole a painting.

239
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:22,716
Ed, he's better than I thought,
I'm afraid.

240
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,593
I sold that painting two weeks ago.

241
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,932
If I may,
I'd like to determine whether this

242
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,110
was actually the work
of Despereaux. Now,

243
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:33,327
I assume you found
no alarms tripped?

244
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:35,103
- No prints?
- No, none...

245
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:38,649
But we did find a burning cigarette
in the ashtray over there.

246
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,444
And Mr. Stockwell is not a smoker.

247
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:42,608
- A merchanteuse blonde?
- Blonde?

248
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,861
Where's the blonde?
I'll need to read her immediately.

249
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:47,976
It's a blonde filtered cigarette.
Merchanteuse. It's french.

250
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,454
Despereaux always leaves
one burning as his signature.

251
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:53,123
The only photographic of Despereaux

252
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:55,125
is extremely any chance take
of wondering...

253
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,773
Despereaux always comes in
and out of town undetected,

254
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:17,174
with an army of aliases,
usually of an artist.

255
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,299
Pardon me!

256
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,580
If everyone would like
to join to the roof,

257
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:23,776
the psychic criminal-catching portion
of the day is about to begin.

258
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:28,033
Everyone, please stay where you are.
He does this all the time.

259
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:36,915
Mildly impressive
that you found me here.

260
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,905
You two are making
a marked improvement from your...

261
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,923
harlequinade antics on the slopes.

262
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,205
In my defense,
I have two left knees.

263
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,876
You know what's more impressive?

264
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:48,136
In about 15 seconds,

265
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,765
you're gonna see a fierce,
albeit gunless, American detective,

266
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,644
his striking snow bunny partner,
which I mean nothing salacious by,

267
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:56,978
and half the R.C.M.P.

268
00:14:57,406 --> 00:15:00,188
are gonna storm this roof
and take you down.

269
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:02,858
Wait for it...

270
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:05,818
I'd love to.

271
00:15:05,943 --> 00:15:07,279
But I really have to go.

272
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,343
Where do you think you're going?

273
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:16,517
To my room.

274
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,319
Now it's your turn

275
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:20,835
to wait for it.

276
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:32,430
Clearly, that was more impressive.

277
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,145
I am telling you, he was here.
He was right here.

278
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,938
And he jumped off.
From a handstand!

279
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,691
It wasn't from a handstand,
he just...

280
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:48,153
- He jumped off normal style.
- He jumped off a 26-story building?

281
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,610
Somebody was just spotted coming out
of the service elevator.

282
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:52,033
We didn't have a man?

283
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,034
Because you asked everyone
to come up here.

284
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,906
- You know, because of Shawn.
- It doesn't matter. It's not him.

285
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:59,782
We just saw Despereaux
leap from this building!

286
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:02,127
- He was wearing a flying suit.
- We don't know that.

287
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,337
Guys!

288
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:08,840
Look, I just want you to know
that I believe you.

289
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:12,219
Completely. Except for the jumping off
the building part.

290
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,263
Mackintosh!

291
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,001
We looked like idiots.

292
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:18,226
Gus, we have to regroup.
And we need to eat.

293
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:21,067
Shawn, this place seems a little...

294
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:22,522
- Exclusive?
- Dark.

295
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:24,780
Cozy. Romantic.

296
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:26,004
A little sexy.

297
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:28,671
First of all, you say those words
like they're bad things.

298
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:31,405
Secondly, do you know how hard it is
to get a reservation at this place?

299
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:33,523
You have to call,
like, a month in advance.

300
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:35,631
You invited me
on this trip on Friday.

301
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:37,944
- When did you call?
- It's irrelevant.

302
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:39,319
What matters...

303
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:42,083
Dude. Dude! There he is.

304
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,668
He's sitting right there.

305
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,020
What do we do? Do we call the cops?
What if he sees us?

306
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:47,590
- He sees us.
- How do you know?

307
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,823
- He's waving us over.
- My gosh, he is.

308
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:52,228
- We shouldn't go over there.
- Right, right.

309
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,809
We found you.
So... looks like we win.

310
00:17:01,574 --> 00:17:04,325
I am neither known nor wanted
in this country.

311
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,607
At best, I'm a person of interest
in the places I do my work.

312
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,317
Such is the curse of my talent.

313
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:14,823
So since I have taken the time
to find you,

314
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,035
please,
don't spoil it with rudeness.

315
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,303
Have a seat.

316
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:19,870
Thank you.

317
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:25,625
You know, I've...
I've enjoyed our sparring so far.

318
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:29,082
The look on your faces
when I jumped from that building was...

319
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,779
amusing.

320
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,609
But I'd be remiss
if I didn't inform you that you're...

321
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,985
way out of your league.

322
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,514
The simple fact is,
you'll never catch me.

323
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:41,322
It's impossible.

324
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:45,512
Which makes
what should be an exciting life

325
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:47,649
somewhat pedestrian.

326
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:52,584
I'll tell you what.

327
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:56,649
To make this
more interesting for me,

328
00:17:57,072 --> 00:18:00,161
I'm going to write down
everything that I'm going to do.

329
00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:03,330
Sometime tomorrow,
I'm going to steal a Manet.

330
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,335
And then I'm going to make you
look foolish again.

331
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,672
And then the next day,
I'm going to treat myself like a king.

332
00:18:18,518 --> 00:18:20,473
Here's what I'm going to do.
First,

333
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,103
I'm gonna get some of that maple candy
that everybody seems to be raving about.

334
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,354
Then I'm going to purchase myself
a walking stick.

335
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,785
Preferably something with a ram's head
carved into the handle.

336
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,236
And finally, we're going to catch
ourselves an international art thief.

337
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,474
I'm not saying for sure
it's going to be you.

338
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,115
But... right now
you're at the top of the list.

339
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,575
Are you writing
on our cloth napkins?

340
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:46,374
It's not my fault. You guys should have
some sort of notepad system,

341
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:49,753
like next to pay phones,
they have a little... pad that you...

342
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,533
I just don't understand
why anyone would want to do that.

343
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:55,176
Unless you're animals, of course.

344
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,302
Animals?

345
00:18:57,964 --> 00:18:59,135
What is that?

346
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,597
You know what that is?

347
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,975
Where did he go?
He disappeared again?

348
00:19:05,348 --> 00:19:07,854
I believe so.
Unless he's hiding under the table,

349
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,522
in which case this conversation
would be embarrassing.

350
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:12,761
No, I'm afraid we fell

351
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,612
for the flaming baked Alaska
diversion trick again.

352
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,312
So what are we supposed to do?

353
00:19:17,437 --> 00:19:19,991
You gonna pretend like you got the info
about the Manet psychically?

354
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,032
Please, Gus.

355
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,619
That's cheap and easy.
Give me some credit.

356
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:26,998
We don't know why he just handed
this information over to us.

357
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,167
We'll do what any reasonable
detective would do.

358
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,083
What?

359
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,378
I see a man...

360
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:33,787
net.

361
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:37,759
I see the painter John...

362
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:39,777
Manet.

363
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:40,904
Edouard.

364
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,067
Where in town might one find an...

365
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:44,641
- Edouard Manet.
- What he said.

366
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:48,602
Because I believe that Despereaux
is gonna try and steal one tonight.

367
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:51,146
How clear are you on this?

368
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,191
It's as if he wrote it on a piece
of paper and put it in my hand.

369
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,048
You sure this is the only Manet?

370
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:04,348
There's not a single one
at a gallery in town.

371
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:06,117
I took the initiative
of making a book

372
00:20:06,242 --> 00:20:08,288
of all the things of value
that Despereaux might hit.

373
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,666
I even used my bind-it-all.
Not a manet on the list.

374
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,953
But then your girl detective there,

375
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:15,901
she did a little more digging
and found this.

376
00:20:16,102 --> 00:20:18,073
This is
William Charles Pulver's boat.

377
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:18,998
Yacht.

378
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:20,592
Yacht.

379
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,111
- He's a billionaire.
- Millionaire.

380
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:27,263
Former billionaire, now millionaire,
living off of his yacht.

381
00:20:27,388 --> 00:20:29,890
Has an extensive art collection.
He sailed into town yesterday.

382
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:33,578
He has a late-period Manet hanging
over the piano in his state room.

383
00:20:33,703 --> 00:20:35,653
What exactly are you wearing?

384
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:37,470
What?

385
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:40,735
You look like Julie Christie
in <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>.

386
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,521
I get cold, okay?

387
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:45,785
- I grew up in a subtropical climate.
- No, I didn't mean it...

388
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:49,127
I think it's, you know,
I mean... I think it looks nice.

389
00:20:49,252 --> 00:20:51,291
What is the matter with you?
- I don't know.

390
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,683
We can still talk as friends.

391
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:56,543
- I know that.
- All right, I can't do this.

392
00:20:56,668 --> 00:20:58,893
Spencer, you've got to find me
a weapon of some sort.

393
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:01,016
I don't care if it's a cane
with a blow dart in it.

394
00:21:01,141 --> 00:21:03,434
- If this thing goes down...
- We're waiting for a single man

395
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,147
to enter an empty boat.

396
00:21:05,272 --> 00:21:07,207
Which may require deadly force.

397
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:12,118
Shawn, I gotta pee.

398
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:15,651
- I told you to go back at the hotel.
- I couldn't. I got freaked out.

399
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,274
There were rose petals everywhere.
All over the toilet.

400
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:20,515
Why would they do that?
It's weird.

401
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:22,322
It's not weird.
It's wonderful.

402
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,332
- Did you see that?
- What?

403
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,964
I saw something.
It's a shadow.

404
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:28,411
It's a person.

405
00:21:29,061 --> 00:21:32,053
- What is he doing out here?
- He's definitely packing heat.

406
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:34,073
- That makes one of you.
- Shut up, Guster.

407
00:21:34,198 --> 00:21:36,252
- Let's all just think this through.
- There is a man

408
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,921
and a shadow on the dock.

409
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,000
- A man and a shadow down on the dock.
- Tell them not to approach.

410
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,383
Don't approach.

411
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,262
- Don't approach the man or the shadow.
- They're approaching!

412
00:21:55,354 --> 00:21:56,314
False alarm.

413
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,816
It is a false alarm.
This is not our perp.

414
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,176
- Everybody back to...
- It's too late.

415
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:03,317
He took it already.

416
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:07,951
That's definitely not a Manet.

417
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,804
So he pretty much told us exactly
what he was going to steal,

418
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:15,375
where he was gonna steal it from,

419
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,586
when he was gonna be there,
we couldn't catch him.

420
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,212
I mean, how good is this guy, Gus?

421
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,382
Why are we on this carriage ride?

422
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,700
You don't find it oddly romantic?

423
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,217
What?

424
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,805
No. Not at all.

425
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:32,446
What better way
for a couple best buddies

426
00:22:32,571 --> 00:22:36,203
to take in the stars, some cool,
crisp Canadian air?

427
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,006
Maybe solve an art theft.

428
00:22:38,131 --> 00:22:40,942
So just let me know when you want me
to head to the kissing bridge.

429
00:22:43,382 --> 00:22:45,238
- Wait a minute.
- What?

430
00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:46,636
Wait a...

431
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,184
Now it all makes sense.

432
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:53,538
This whole thing.
The rose petals on the bed.

433
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,886
The reservation at the bistro.
Now this carriage ride.

434
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:58,134
This whole trip.

435
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:00,503
It was all planned as a romantic week
for you and Abigail.

436
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:05,095
All right. I admit it.

437
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,640
The dates for her teacher's conference
changed quite unexpectedly.

438
00:23:07,897 --> 00:23:10,575
That's why you asked me at the last
minute. I was an afterthought?

439
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,807
Don't get caught up
in the minutiae of trip planning.

440
00:23:13,078 --> 00:23:16,394
That's it. You deceived me, Shawn.
I'm done with this. I'm finished.

441
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:18,312
We need to figure out
what his next move is.

442
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,481
Besides, you do not wanna
get out of this carriage.

443
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:22,454
It's freezing. It's dark out here.

444
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:24,527
And there are most likely
raccoons everywhere.

445
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:28,144
I'm staying here.
You are getting out.

446
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:31,784
My credit card paid for this ride,
and I'm taking it, just not with you.

447
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,661
But good luck
figuring out this case.

448
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,912
What are you...

449
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,280
Stop it!

450
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:40,877
At least leave me the blanket!

451
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,802
Hello, raccoons.
I know you're watching me.

452
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,836
I don't blame you. I'd be doing
the same thing if I was you.

453
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,210
I mean, who am I?

454
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:54,595
Some mysterious biped
infiltrating your natural habitat.

455
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:57,553
I know you don't mean to scare me
with your beady little yellow eyes

456
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:59,027
that glow like the devil.

457
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:01,052
Let's do a list... we'll do a list

458
00:24:01,177 --> 00:24:02,573
of famous raccoons.

459
00:24:03,395 --> 00:24:05,295
Meeko from <i>Pocahontas</i>.
Check.

460
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,790
Rocky Raccoon.

461
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,297
Judges, good reading on Rocky Ra...

462
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,287
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

463
00:24:18,198 --> 00:24:19,072
<i>To my room.</i>

464
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:27,325
Okay, you little masked
night bandits.

465
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,080
I gotta go.

466
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:31,719
I think I know where Despereaux is.

467
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:35,822
But you're probably not interested.

468
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:37,557
Well, it's...

469
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,560
Maybe a couple of you are.

470
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:42,631
More so than...
More so than the others.

471
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:46,943
Hello, Bertrand.

472
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:50,488
- Yes, sir. How may I help you?
- I seem to have misplaced my card key.

473
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,825
I'd be happy to replace your key.
I just need your name.

474
00:24:54,135 --> 00:24:56,119
Pierre Despereaux.

475
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:59,413
I'm sorry, there's no one
by that name registered here.

476
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,560
<i>Despereaux always comes in
and out of town undetected</i>

477
00:25:03,685 --> 00:25:05,586
<i>with an army of aliases,
usually of an artist.</i>

478
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:07,866
Here's the thing.

479
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:10,591
I register under lots of different names
in order to protect my privacy,

480
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,387
so why don't we try "John Van Gogh".

481
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:17,443
Nothing?

482
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,560
Jacques Hockneystine?

483
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,104
"Stein."

484
00:25:26,034 --> 00:25:27,525
I'm not sure what shenanigans

485
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,944
you're up to, but I don't like it,
I don't appreciate it.

486
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:32,572
It might've been Edgar Degas.

487
00:25:33,052 --> 00:25:34,102
12th floor.

488
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:41,551
That name is here.

489
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:45,334
- Do you think I could...
- I'm so sorry about this.

490
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,739
My assistant makes all the reservations.
She's been under heavy medication.

491
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:51,076
She was recently diagnosed
with parvo.

492
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,092
Isn't that a dog's disease?

493
00:25:53,864 --> 00:25:55,304
Yes. Yes it is.

494
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,097
My assistant is a golden retriever.
Adorable, but dim.

495
00:25:58,662 --> 00:26:00,516
Her whole keyboard
is just three big buttons.

496
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,436
She has very large paws.
Should've fired her years ago,

497
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,305
but she's a rescue,
and I just didn't have the heart.

498
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,403
Gus, guess where I am right now?

499
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,181
I'm in Despereaux's room right now.

500
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,468
No, I'm not kidding. I'm gonna rifle
through all of this stuff,

501
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:20,558
and I'm totally gonna pull a J. Turturro
from <i>Miller's crossing</i> on him.

502
00:26:20,683 --> 00:26:23,408
And then we'll get some sundaes.
I'm just gonna sit here quietly,

503
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:25,872
wait for him to get back,
and then I'm gonna click on the lamp.

504
00:26:25,997 --> 00:26:28,181
Scare the gingersnaps out of him.
What.

505
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,732
No, I don't remember
how that movie ends, why?

506
00:26:34,364 --> 00:26:37,564
That's a "negativo"
on the sundaes, buddy.

507
00:26:37,689 --> 00:26:39,680
I repeat, negative on the sundaes.

508
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:46,717
So. So... This is your room?

509
00:26:48,136 --> 00:26:50,589
This is embarrassing, isn't it?
I mean,

510
00:26:50,714 --> 00:26:52,567
it's a real rattlesnake
of a misunderstanding.

511
00:26:52,692 --> 00:26:55,965
It's amazing how much
this place looks just like the room

512
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,078
that Gus and I have over at the...

513
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,451
Captain Vancouver do-right inn.

514
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,369
Sit.

515
00:27:05,718 --> 00:27:07,953
I never was a fan
of <i>Miller's crossing</i>.

516
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:09,835
Too much gore and violence.

517
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:13,756
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I appreciate a good murder.

518
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:16,338
But why does it have to be so messy?

519
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:18,094
Where's the elegance?

520
00:27:18,634 --> 00:27:19,634
The grace?

521
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,473
People don't kill people
with panache anymore.

522
00:27:23,884 --> 00:27:26,894
I wish I could stay and chat with you,
but I'm getting ready to press on.

523
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:33,442
There wouldn't happen to be
a Manet in that suitcase

524
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,075
by any chance, would there?

525
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,530
You know, you should keep
at this detective business.

526
00:27:38,815 --> 00:27:40,866
You have the hair for it,
and that's half the battle.

527
00:27:43,648 --> 00:27:44,580
What?

528
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:48,165
You thought my Marco Ciccone
loafers were a gun?

529
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:49,792
Maybe.

530
00:27:53,748 --> 00:27:57,133
This is my gun, you see?

531
00:27:57,521 --> 00:28:00,924
A gentleman of leisure never packs
his weapon next to his socks.

532
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:01,971
It's uncouth.

533
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,452
What, you think
I'm going to kill you?

534
00:28:06,537 --> 00:28:07,810
You're right.

535
00:28:07,935 --> 00:28:09,274
Not yet, anyway.

536
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:13,968
I have to be pushed very hard
to get into that kind of business.

537
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:17,903
Number one, it's messy.
And I have to spend one more night here.

538
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:21,862
Number two,
you have nothing on me but your word.

539
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:25,120
Your very shaky, very suspect word.

540
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:29,165
Therefore, you pose absolutely
no threat to me whatsoever.

541
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,394
I do have to thank you, though.

542
00:28:33,188 --> 00:28:35,046
You have been very useful for me.

543
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,464
My pleasure.

544
00:28:36,753 --> 00:28:38,466
And now, if you don't mind...

545
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,106
I don't even know how to respond.

546
00:28:42,231 --> 00:28:45,473
I'm both relieved
and offended at the same time.

547
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:48,189
But I know when I'm beat.

548
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:54,742
One more thing.

549
00:28:55,746 --> 00:28:57,259
What day is today?

550
00:28:57,898 --> 00:28:58,818
Sunday.

551
00:28:59,258 --> 00:29:00,858
That's what I thought.

552
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,236
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I am telling you, he is done.

553
00:29:07,361 --> 00:29:11,082
- He is heading for the border.
- Listen. It's not Molson time just yet.

554
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,196
- He's gonna steal one more thing.
- So what?

555
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:14,710
- I don't know.
- Where is it?

556
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,880
I don't have a completely clear picture
on that, but I am honing. I am a honer.

557
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:20,160
There is a small jet

558
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:23,308
waiting at a private airfield just
over the border in Blaine, Washington,

559
00:29:23,433 --> 00:29:25,310
registered to one of his aliases.

560
00:29:25,435 --> 00:29:26,865
Barry Picasso?

561
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,303
It's scheduled to take off in 4 hours.
We plan on being there.

562
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:32,394
Here's the thing.
I actually spoke with him last night.

563
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:36,018
What do you mean,
you spoke with him?

564
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:38,400
I had a... vision,
wherein we... we spoke.

565
00:29:38,922 --> 00:29:40,119
See, he had a vision.

566
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:42,529
What exactly was he doing
in this vision?

567
00:29:43,227 --> 00:29:43,989
Packing.

568
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,701
- Of course, because he's leaving town!
- Wrong, because he wanted me

569
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,538
to think he was leaving town.
It was all a show for my benefit.

570
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:53,249
There is no way this guy would leave
town with out his dry cleaning,

571
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,506
and that does not get delivered
until Tuesday. Trust me,

572
00:29:55,631 --> 00:29:58,262
he cares just as much about his pants
as he does about thievery.

573
00:29:58,387 --> 00:30:01,165
So let me get this straight,
Despereaux comes to you in a vision

574
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,322
to fake doing something?

575
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,010
<i>I do have to thank you, though.</i>

576
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:10,390
<i>You have been very useful for me.</i>

577
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:13,736
I was a smokescreen.

578
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:17,027
He used me as a smokescreen.

579
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,942
I'm sorry, Shawn,
but this is a really good lead.

580
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,114
Wait, wait, guys!
Don't you at least want to hear my plan?

581
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,534
It could be good!
You don't know.

582
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:32,037
What?

583
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,264
- I want to see your book.
- My book?

584
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:40,379
With things
that Despereaux might steal.

585
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,423
- Nobody ever wants to see my book.
- I do.

586
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:45,634
I want to see the book.
I'm also going to eat these waffles.

587
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:49,761
I gotta hand it to you, Mackintosh.

588
00:30:49,886 --> 00:30:52,197
The binding on this thing
is impressive.

589
00:30:52,322 --> 00:30:55,185
The presentation, I mean...
Just outstanding.

590
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:06,113
<i>And then the next day
I'm going to treat myself like a king.</i>

591
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:09,006
He told me everything.

592
00:31:10,264 --> 00:31:11,493
That clever bastard.

593
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:12,828
Who?

594
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,289
What can you tell me about the buschlen
mowatt gallery in Yaletown?

595
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,459
I know quite a bit, actually.
What in particular?

596
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,335
The security system.

597
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:23,339
Government issue. I was on the team
that installed it and set it up.

598
00:31:23,704 --> 00:31:25,341
That's fortuitous.
Can it be set down?

599
00:31:28,831 --> 00:31:30,888
I have a shot at redemption for you.
For recognition.

600
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,641
But it's going to be dangerous.
And we're gonna need Gus. Are you in?

601
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,768
Wait before you answer that.
Are you a fan of solving crimes?

602
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,191
That's my man.

603
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:56,080
- That's him.
- That's who?

604
00:31:56,776 --> 00:31:58,902
That's the gallery owner.
He's the last one out.

605
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:00,777
That means it's closed.
We can go inside.

606
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:03,214
- That's where the crown is.
- That was your plan?

607
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,841
- To steal the crown?
- No. Absolutely not.

608
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,466
Don't be ridiculous.

609
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:10,061
Possibly move the crown at best.

610
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:12,405
But the point is to get to it first,
before Despereaux.

611
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,141
Not only is this a felony
of international proportions,

612
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,262
but also, we are not art thieves.

613
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,363
What do you think this is for?

614
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:21,063
Big apple, come in.

615
00:32:21,545 --> 00:32:22,888
<i>Are we good to go?</i>

616
00:32:23,313 --> 00:32:24,400
Just about, Shawn.

617
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:25,983
<i>Over.</i>

618
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,282
See, Gus?

619
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:34,260
It's not really breaking in

620
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,013
if the actual cops help you break in,
am I right?

621
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:39,205
Do I need to explain the law to you?

622
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,582
You can try, but...

623
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,095
It's probably not gonna make much
of a difference.

624
00:32:44,244 --> 00:32:46,422
So how do you plan on getting
through this obstacle?

625
00:32:48,122 --> 00:32:51,260
Dude, I know you've seen <i>Entrapment</i>
at least 26 times.

626
00:32:52,056 --> 00:32:53,262
You have to do this.

627
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:55,431
You're twice as limber
as C. Zeta-Jones.

628
00:32:57,682 --> 00:33:00,001
- Not happening.
- We don't have a lot of options here.

629
00:33:00,126 --> 00:33:01,854
It's not like we can turn back.

630
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:03,397
Look, it's three lasers.

631
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,734
Plus, they're canadian lasers.
I'm gonna guide you through this.

632
00:33:08,604 --> 00:33:09,528
Usain Bolt.

633
00:33:14,566 --> 00:33:17,375
- Gus to the world.
- That's what i'm talkin' about!

634
00:33:18,473 --> 00:33:19,623
You got this.

635
00:33:22,342 --> 00:33:23,692
That's it, buddy.

636
00:33:24,012 --> 00:33:27,443
Now... now lower your right shoulder
just a little bit, like two inches.

637
00:33:27,568 --> 00:33:29,944
Yeah, there you go.
That's your way in.

638
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:32,301
That's your gateway.
Arch your back.

639
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:33,697
Clear.

640
00:33:33,822 --> 00:33:36,305
Watch your feet, watch your feet.
Okay, you're good.

641
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,807
Okay, all right.
This one's a little trickier.

642
00:33:41,008 --> 00:33:43,187
Knee to chest.
Knee to chest!

643
00:33:43,385 --> 00:33:45,773
Now pivot about 30 degrees
to your left.

644
00:33:47,251 --> 00:33:50,486
Safe.
Dude, that's your safe haven.

645
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,636
Right hand green!
Right hand green!

646
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,157
That's twister, Shawn.

647
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,950
How come we don't play that anymore?

648
00:33:58,075 --> 00:33:59,953
Get your butt higher!
Arch your back!

649
00:34:00,326 --> 00:34:01,872
Spread your cheeks if you can.

650
00:34:02,952 --> 00:34:03,874
Scratch that.

651
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,334
Abort cheek spreading.

652
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,954
Pivot.
Pivot your body about 30 degrees.

653
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,772
Left, to the left. You got it.

654
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:12,132
But... what?

655
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,225
- What are you doing?
- I had Mackintosh disarm the lasers.

656
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:23,519
But I wanted to see
how you would do it.

657
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:27,064
Now we know for the future that if
we ever encounter this exact scenario,

658
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,066
you are the man for the job.

659
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,207
What?

660
00:34:32,147 --> 00:34:33,247
There it is.

661
00:34:40,438 --> 00:34:41,585
Where's the crown?

662
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,540
It's in that metal box.
It closes when the gallery does.

663
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,501
Don't worry,
Mackintosh disarmed this too.

664
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,379
This, my friend, is the easy part.

665
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,509
You said this was the easy part.

666
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:57,351
It's supposed to be the easy part!

667
00:34:57,476 --> 00:35:00,180
Don't I get any credit for planning
this whole thing in less than two hours?

668
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,516
No, you don't! The cops
are gonna be here any second now.

669
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,049
They will not.

670
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:07,632
Man, stop playing.
There's nobody behind me.

671
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:09,523
- Shut up, Shawn.
- I'm not turning around.

672
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:10,691
Freeze!

673
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:17,873
Dad!

674
00:35:18,435 --> 00:35:19,783
They arrested you too?

675
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,202
I posted your bail.
It was more than I expected.

676
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,722
You owe me the difference
plus the exchange rate.

677
00:35:24,847 --> 00:35:27,278
Do you realize they charged me
nine bucks for a <i>nusmagazine</i>?

678
00:35:27,403 --> 00:35:29,001
- And me?
- You didn't bail out Gus?

679
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,964
I gotta bail both of you out?
And your dad?

680
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,921
Shawn used my one call
to vote for <i>American Idol</i>.

681
00:35:34,595 --> 00:35:37,509
You didn't say anything about Gus.
I thought he had his own cash.

682
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,753
- Don't you have a credit card?
- My CB is maxed out.

683
00:35:39,878 --> 00:35:42,440
Dad, believe me, I've spoken to him
about not overextending himself.

684
00:35:42,565 --> 00:35:44,933
- Do you really think this is fun?
- Stanley park was nice.

685
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,770
- You can't leave this country.
- Dad, do you understand?

686
00:35:48,317 --> 00:35:49,980
We had him. But...

687
00:35:50,575 --> 00:35:51,523
But what?

688
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,984
- He was too good.
- Too good?

689
00:35:54,258 --> 00:35:57,236
- What'd I raise you to do?
- It was literally the perfect crime.

690
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:01,408
The perfect crime? There is
no such thing as a perfect crime.

691
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,827
Well then, it was as close
as you can possibly get.

692
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:07,080
The only way it's close is if you make
it look like the perfect crime.

693
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,750
Now, I'm gonna see
if I can put Gus on my credit card.

694
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,586
In the meantime, I got a 4:00
salmon boat, and if I Miss that,

695
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:15,102
this trip is a complete waste.

696
00:36:21,857 --> 00:36:24,292
Big apple. What is this?
What happened?

697
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:25,904
- Fired.
- Why?

698
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:27,017
Really?

699
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,436
Because of what happened down
at the museum.

700
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,940
Man, I'm so sorry.

701
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:34,566
- This is partially my fault.
- Partially? It was your idea.

702
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:37,236
It probably would've just been
a suspension,

703
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,157
but then the crown
ended up going missing...

704
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:41,280
- Say what?
- You know?

705
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:42,598
It was gone.

706
00:36:42,723 --> 00:36:45,160
- When they opened the case.
- That's impossible.

707
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:48,704
No, when they opened the metal
display case, the crown was missing.

708
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,099
<i>Where's the crown?</i>

709
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:52,543
<i>It's in that metal box.
It closes when the gallery does.</i>

710
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:54,536
Dude, we watched the museum close.

711
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:56,770
We watched the thing close.
We never left the building.

712
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:59,006
The only way
he could've taken it is if...

713
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:00,286
How?

714
00:37:01,114 --> 00:37:02,594
Is if he had had it all along.

715
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,188
<i>I sold that painting two weeks ago.</i>

716
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,390
<i>- He's a billionaire.
- Millionaire.</i>

717
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:18,569
<i>Okay, former billionaire,
now millionaire, living off his yacht.</i>

718
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,738
I know why Despereaux
never gets caught!

719
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,653
Because he doesn't steal anything!

720
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,578
- We gotta hurry.
- That's my helmet.

721
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:46,055
You have an impressive
learning curve.

722
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,485
Thank you.

723
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,487
I also play the mandocello.

724
00:37:49,612 --> 00:37:50,562
Not well.

725
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:53,103
But who else do you know
who plays the mandocello?

726
00:37:53,362 --> 00:37:55,814
- I'm no longer amused.
- You almost had me.

727
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:59,425
The yacht and the high rise
were just flawless.

728
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,184
But you left me too much time
when you stole the crown.

729
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:03,697
And I covered all my bases.

730
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:06,325
Which means you didn't have time
to steal the crown.

731
00:38:06,554 --> 00:38:07,510
But then,

732
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:10,871
you didn't have to,
because the owner just handed it to you.

733
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:13,624
- I knew you were worthy.
- Worthy.

734
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,592
And very disappointed.

735
00:38:15,982 --> 00:38:18,754
Really? I've been hiding back here
for ten minutes.

736
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:21,465
I thought you were gonna give
your speech from inside the plane.

737
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,718
- I'm seriously cramped back here.
- I'm about to drop the hammer on him.

738
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,762
Just flag down the stewardess.
Order a mojito.

739
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:28,616
Just call me when you're done.

740
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,060
Man, I thought you were so cool.
But you're just here to look the part.

741
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:36,881
This whole time, I'm thinking,
"this guy is Thomas Crown."

742
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:41,193
You're barely Remington Steele.
Which makes me, what, Laura Holt?

743
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,609
You think a guy like me wants
to be Stephanie Zimbalist?

744
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:46,568
Maybe.

745
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:51,410
The items were handed to you
one by one.

746
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:53,413
<i>- That's him.
- That's who?</i>

747
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,499
<i>That's the gallery owner.
He's the last one out.</i>

748
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,793
The gallery owner had the crown
when he left the gallery.

749
00:38:58,167 --> 00:38:59,795
He was having money troubles.

750
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:01,815
As did the rest of your victims.

751
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,174
And you...
You're just the middleman.

752
00:39:04,627 --> 00:39:07,009
You made it look like the items
were being stolen.

753
00:39:07,313 --> 00:39:09,763
Hence your calling card.

754
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:11,627
And always in a series, right?

755
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:14,267
So it wouldn't call suspicion
to an owner in financial peril

756
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,511
who suddenly gets his Manet stolen?

757
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:19,189
Insurance fraud.

758
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,318
Really?

759
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:21,743
That is so lame.

760
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:24,506
- Do you even have a pilot's license?
- I do.

761
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,461
But now I feel as though
I have to hurt you,

762
00:39:28,586 --> 00:39:29,825
which saddens me.

763
00:39:30,364 --> 00:39:32,382
I thought
you were a master criminal.

764
00:39:32,507 --> 00:39:35,157
The genius of my plan
is in its simplicity.

765
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,623
Perhaps it's not as sexy
as you believed.

766
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,396
But don't forget,

767
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:43,505
I got away with it.

768
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,383
No, you didn't.

769
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,888
Bet you're not too happy to see me
right about now, are you?

770
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:56,810
I have absolutely no idea
who you are.

771
00:39:58,563 --> 00:39:59,563
Detective.

772
00:39:59,968 --> 00:40:00,968
Thank you.

773
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:09,890
Your boss is really good.

774
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:11,643
We do not work for him.

775
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:13,452
It just seems that way sometimes.

776
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:19,811
I've often fantasized
about escaping from prison, you know.

777
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:30,844
Don't you think it's odd
that you're in a relationship now,

778
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:35,000
yet you invite me to maybe
the most romantic place on earth?

779
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,676
Jules, listen.
I made these plans weeks ago.

780
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:41,353
And Gus refused
to come on account he's a man.

781
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,192
And I'm a man.
Or some nonsense like that.

782
00:40:45,813 --> 00:40:47,452
Look, I have a point. It's this.

783
00:40:47,577 --> 00:40:49,653
I refuse to feel uncomfortable
around you.

784
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,765
It's silly.
You mean too much to me.

785
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,536
And I am perfectly capable of keeping
this platonic as long as you are.

786
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:59,247
- Please. I can.
- Well, I can too.

787
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,318
Great.

788
00:41:02,509 --> 00:41:03,542
But how?

789
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:07,608
So at least show me what you had
planned for this perfect date.

790
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:09,881
Okay, but promise not to laugh.

791
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:15,027
You hired this guy?

792
00:41:15,152 --> 00:41:16,702
Technically, Gus did.

793
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:18,489
Would've lost our deposit.

794
00:41:18,614 --> 00:41:20,540
He was supposed to be more discreet.

795
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,515
This is overkill, huh?

796
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:33,465
Not if you're six.

797
00:41:34,676 --> 00:41:36,589
A mime, though?
Really, Shawn?

798
00:41:36,714 --> 00:41:39,277
I don't know, you don't really
strike me as a mime guy.

799
00:41:39,402 --> 00:41:41,042
The mime had nothing to do with me.

800
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,667
This mime is clearly working
on his own.

801
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,117
- You seen enough?
- More than.

802
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:50,653
- So abigail's into opera, huh?
- No, not really.

803
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:52,481
Just robust italian men.

804
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,069
I didn't even know he sang,
actually.

805
00:41:55,381 --> 00:41:57,593
- Look at that bridge.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

806
00:41:57,718 --> 00:41:59,033
Little-known fact:

807
00:41:59,158 --> 00:42:01,625
- that bridge was built by wolves.
- Really?
