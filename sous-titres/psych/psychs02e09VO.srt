1
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:16,668
Who is that?

2
00:00:17,126 --> 00:00:19,472
Maybe only the coolest guy ever.

3
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:27,955
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late. Had to do
a little extra paperwork. Let's hit it.

4
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:32,114
Sorry, dad, we were just
checking out that supercop.

5
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:35,032
Shawn, that is not a supercop.

6
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:36,782
That guy is a bounty hunter.

7
00:00:36,797 --> 00:00:38,465
What's that, a cop
with a cooler name?

8
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,722
He's not cool, Shawn.
He's a nuisance.

9
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:44,755
He's a privately hired half criminal...
operating outside the law.

10
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:47,185
Shawn, look at me.
Shawn.

11
00:00:48,538 --> 00:00:50,786
He's not about justice,
he's about the money.

12
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:53,721
- But they look cool, right?
- All right, listen to me, son.

13
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:57,172
If you want to arrest somebody,
you do it the right way.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,095
You do it with a badge.
You got it?

15
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:02,251
Let's hit it.

16
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:05,273
All right, everybody,
listen up, listen up!

17
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:07,243
Take a close look
at this picture.

18
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,048
His name is Dwayne Tancana.

19
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:11,920
12 counts of grand larceny
on his sheet.

20
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:14,160
Just did 36 months
on his last beef.

21
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:17,979
But he's upped his game recently when he was
charged with the murder of Isabella Cole.

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,360
Found dead after a robbery
invasion at her home.

23
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,770
He was supposed to be arraigned this morning,
but he managed to escape police custody.

24
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,240
He's on the run.

25
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,150
Considered armed and dangerous.

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,020
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yes.

27
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:32,080
How did he manage to escape?

28
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,642
What, are you writing a
movie script about this?

29
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:36,514
Why don't you focus on the facts I'm
giving you instead of compiling your own?

30
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:39,120
You know what, detective? I got this.

31
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,750
It was my fault.

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,010
Tancana was in my custody at the time.

33
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,030
I was escorting him from
holding to the courthouse.

34
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,260
He was cuffed, but not leg shackled.

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,580
One of the uniformed officers that was
following us stopped to tie his shoe.

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,239
I should have lagged back, but I didn't.

37
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,570
We rounded a blind corner, he took
the opportunity to head butt me,

38
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,752
making a run for it while I was down.

39
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,848
Okay, can we move on now?
Time is noton our side, people.

40
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:09,000
You will all be assigned locations
I want you to track and monitor.

41
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,012
- Mcnab!
- Yes, sir.

42
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,130
Where's my damn coffee?

43
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,890
Sir, I put it in the
conference room for you, sir.

44
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,410
Who the hell is that?

45
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,580
That's Byrd Tatums. A bounty hunter.

46
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,630
There's a $50,000 bounty on Tancana.

47
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,730
Bounty hunter... there are no bounty
hunters allowed in this station!

48
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,739
Get him out of here, now.

49
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,520
He was hired by the
victim's husband, Loman Cole.

50
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,006
They wanna talk to you.

51
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,010
His lips are touching my personal mug.

52
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,320
Look, Mr. Cole, I understand
how you must feel.

53
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,410
But you should take comfort in
knowing that myself, detective Lassiter,

54
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,270
and the entire department are doing everything
they can to bring Tancana back into custody.

55
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,530
Oh, I think you've already done your part.

56
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,310
And that was allowing my
wife's killer to escape.

57
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,550
Now, maybe you can just step aside
and let Mr. Tatums do what he does.

58
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,479
All do respect, sir, what we
did was apprehend the man,

59
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,790
arrest him, and charge him with murder.

60
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,711
Yeah. How's that working out for you?

61
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:08,400
You listen to me, pal.

62
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,716
This is our investigation.

63
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,771
And that is my damn coffee.

64
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,270
Well, first of all, I think
we should go to the airport

65
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,340
and brief security on Tancana's stats.

66
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,263
- Then I was thinking.
- Yeah, look, O'Hara.

67
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,020
Actually, uh, here's the thing.

68
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,690
I'm gonna have you stick around here,

69
00:03:29,712 --> 00:03:31,640
and I'm gonna go out and take
care of the rest of that.

70
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:35,789
- Wait a minute, are you punishing me?
- No! No, I'm not punishing you.

71
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:40,820
It's... look, with the chief out of town, this
all falls on my shoulders, so it's my call.

72
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:42,850
I'm gonna work the
field and I need you here.

73
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:45,030
Oh, my god, you are punishing me.

74
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,910
Look, I need to be out there.
I need to find him.

75
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,170
We will. I promise you. We've got
every bit of manpower on this.

76
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:53,391
- Every bit?
- Yes, every bit.

77
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,823
No.

78
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:58,663
No way, O'Hara. I am not gonna do that.
We don't need them on this.

79
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:00,140
Should I dial the
number or do you want to?

80
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,890
- O'Hara, this is my call.
- It's ringing.

81
00:04:01,912 --> 00:04:03,269
- What did you do?
- You said to call.

82
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,248
No, I said it's my
call whether or not to call.

83
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,061
Uh, hi, Shawn. Um.

84
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,020
It's, uh, Carlton Lassiter.

85
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,454
So all I'm asking you
to do is track Tancana

86
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:17,203
and get back to me
with any psychic leads,

87
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:20,297
or whatever the hell it is
you call 'em, on his whereabouts.

88
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,860
- Dude, it's Byrd. Remember Byrd?
- How could I forget him?

89
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,043
He looks exactly the same
way as when we were kids.

90
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,880
- Same vest, same Shaun Cassidy hair.
- Guys, here. Over here. Listen to me.

91
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:33,504
You are, in no uncertain terms,

92
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:36,350
to make any physical contact with
this man, do you understand?

93
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,630
He's highly dangerous.
He strangled her with his bare hands.

94
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,757
He knocked her husband out with a vase.

95
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,830
I don't need to remind you the
reputation of one of our own is at stake.

96
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,580
Just so we're clear. Just
so there's no confusion,

97
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,630
let me explain this one more time
in terms I know you'll understand.

98
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,720
Cops are here, bounty hunters
are here, psychics are here.

99
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,710
- We beat bounty hunters.
- By a knuckle.

100
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,600
Where are orthodontists on this scale?

101
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,998
I'm asking for your help.

102
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,290
Don't make me ask twice.

103
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,784
Give us a second. I have
a question for Mr. Cole.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,750
I'm very sorry for your loss.

105
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:20,140
My name is Shawn Spencer. This
is my partner Burton Guster.

106
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,180
I'm a psychic here at the department,
and I have one question for you.

107
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:27,548
The $50,000 bounty, does that
apply exclusively to Byrd here?

108
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,250
I don't care who gets the 50,000.

109
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,030
It goes to whoever brings
Tancana in, and fast.

110
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,231
Thank you.

111
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,067
That's good to know.

112
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:38,091
You gotta be kidding me.

113
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,370
- My god, Cole has amazing hair.
- Shawn, focus.

114
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:42,727
- Did you smell it?
- Of course I did.

115
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,300
Ginger blossoms. But who cares?

116
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,450
I care, deeply. That's kangaroo paste.

117
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,100
- Kangaroo what?
- Hair gel.

118
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,011
You can only get it in Australia.

119
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,070
I've been trying to get my
hands on it for months.

120
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,103
Maybe he has a contact from "down unda.

121
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,928
- Shawn.
- My hair's hungry for it, Gus.

122
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,480
Okay, Lassie!

123
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,160
The answer is an
enthusiastic and sprightly yes.

124
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:06,632
You've got yourself a couple
of bounty hunters.

132
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,100
Hey, man! You remember us?

133
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,540
Uh, we had a moment
once when we were kids.

134
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,130
Well, let me think. No.

135
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,960
But you winked at us.

136
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,540
Yeah. Well, that was
probably involuntary.

137
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,130
I have a blepharospasm in my
right eye. It makes me twitch.

138
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,048
Gus and I are brand new
to the bounty hunter scene.

139
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,540
We were hoping you had a
few friendly tips for us.

140
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:54,012
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure.

141
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:55,997
Uh, stay out of my way.

142
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,183
Wow. That didn't seem
very friendly at all.

143
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:01,634
Look, if I play my cards
right, this is gonna be my last run.

144
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:06,612
I'm gonna collect my 50 g's, and then
I'm quitting the game. I'm retiring.

145
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,550
What?

146
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,770
My bad.

147
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,600
Usually right when someone's about
to retire, they get shot at, yeah?

148
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,040
Okay, I don't need you peons
screwing this up for me, you got it?

149
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,370
I just put a down payment
on a bar in key west.

150
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,242
Who are the other investors,
Tango and Cash?

151
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,724
You know, it's interesting
you're finding time to make fun

152
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:29,420
when your pretty little blonde lady
detective dropped the ball so hard.

153
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,700
Tell you what, why don't you boys just step
aside and let daddy clean up your mess?

154
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,100
Look, just because we didn't
go to the costume shop

155
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:41,849
and get a bounty hunter's wrist
bracelet and accessories kit,

156
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:45,580
doesn't mean that we won't
be bringing it in a big way.

157
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,700
Well, go ahead and bring it.
Be careful out there. People get hurt.

158
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,248
Oh, and by the way...
these don't come in "tiny.

159
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,516
" We'll just get a women's large.

160
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,740
Wow. I think I hate that guy.

161
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,190
Yeah, that's the way it usually goes
when you meet your childhood heroes, Gus.

162
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,140
Nothing but heartache
and disappointment.

163
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,514
Remember how sad you were when you ran
into judge Reinhold at the dry cleaners?

164
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,390
Shawn, we need to get on this right away.

165
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,270
Yeah, for Juliet.

166
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,068
She's had our backs, now
we're gonna have her back.

167
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,470
- Jules, you okay?
- Fine.

168
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,070
26 seconds.

169
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,542
What are you doing?

170
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,030
Oh, I'm disassembling my side
arm and then assembling it again.

171
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,050
I time myself. It's an
old academy stress exercise.

172
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,800
What are you watching?

173
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,564
Oh, it's a video that
a bystander took  with

174
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:37,452
his cell phone of Tancana
escaping from the courthouse.

175
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,410
Is he diabetic or does he
have a heart condition?

176
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,538
Yeah, he has a heart condition.
How did you know that?

177
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,226
Oh, it came to me. Psychically.

178
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:51,070
I just, you know, I didn't have the
energy for the whole "hand to head" thing.

179
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,270
I'm leaning inquite nicely here.

180
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,590
Did Tancana have any
family in town that we know of?

181
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,605
Yes, he has a cousin who's a short
order cook at marvin's off la cumbre.

182
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,910
But hello, don't you think
that's the first place we checked?

183
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,781
Yeah, hello, Gus.
Look, we gotta go.

184
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,224
But you have my word, we're
gonna make this right.

185
00:09:11,747 --> 00:09:13,680
I already told the
blonde detective there,

186
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,770
I haven't even spoken to
my cousin in months.

187
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,142
- I thought he was in prison.
- He was. Until this morning.

188
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:22,428
When he jumped his arraignment
and escaped from the courthouse.

189
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:26,470
- He's on the run.
- Well, that's awful. I'm in shock.

190
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,110
Yeah, you look like it.

191
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,710
Yeah, so much so you're just gonna
drink some coffee, keep cooking.

192
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,541
Helps me cope.

193
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,880
- Dude,Tancana's here.
- What?

194
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,612
How do you know he's here?

195
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,428
Look at those two truckers.

196
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,720
They're the ones that
ordered the burgers.

197
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:52,880
That's why they're
grappling over the ketchup.

198
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,980
And look at that dude in the corner.

199
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:56,662
Waitress already dropped
off the russian dressing.

200
00:09:56,677 --> 00:09:59,971
Which means he is
waiting on the reuben.

201
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,532
But look what he's
making in the corner there.

202
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,540
Egg whites.

203
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,760
That's not on the menu at a greasy
spoon like this, I'll tell you that much.

204
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:11,882
But it's just what a heart
patient would eat to stay healthy.

205
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,420
- Let's get him!
- No, uh-uh, Shawn. No.

206
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,610
We're bounty hunters. That's
what bounty hunters do.

207
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:26,968
We are not bounty hunters, Shawn.
I'm a pharmaceutical salesman.

208
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,570
And Lassiter made it very clear.
He said, "in no uncertain terms.

209
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,929
" These are certain
terms, Shawn. Certain terms.

210
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,418
Somebody forgot to drink their
courageous juice this morning.

211
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,940
Fine. Get in the car.

212
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,142
Dwayne! Take off now!

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,797
Enjoying that hamburger, huh?

214
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,160
We need to get out of here.

215
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,290
Wait, let's stop and think
about this for a second.

216
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,381
I don't need to think about anything,
Shawn! I wanna get out of here!

217
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,280
But Gus, we were there! We saw him!
What are we gonna tell Jules?

218
00:11:20,294 --> 00:11:21,880
Tell her you're gonna be late.

219
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,720
Uh, I think you're
making a big mistake here.

220
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,490
We need to go.

221
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,482
Drive! Drive drive drive drive drive!

222
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,650
You guys are toast!

223
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,840
You hear me? You're toast!

224
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,950
Dude, we're, like, the best
bounty hunters ever.

225
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,550
The criminals come
straight into our car.

226
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,240
Already cuffed!

227
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,519
about another mile on this
road, turn left on Cabrillo.

228
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:52,000
I gotta make a stop
at a house down there.

229
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,910
Got some bad news for you, buddy.

230
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,250
The only stop we'll be
making is at the police station.

231
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:57,366
I'm turning you in.

232
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,540
'Cause we are bounty hunters.

233
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,310
He's a bounty hunter. I'm
a pharmaceutical salesman.

234
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,780
That's good.

235
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,880
You're bounty hunters.

236
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,150
What is everybody's deal?
Like, what is going on here?

237
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,637
Is it because I'm not wearing the vest?

238
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,910
Is that what it is?

239
00:12:10,922 --> 00:12:12,738
You know what, the truth is,
I'm a psychic detective.

240
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:14,900
This is my partner, Galileo Humpkins.

241
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,560
You know, for the first time, I'm
grateful you didn't use my real name.

242
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,700
All right, you one of
those psychic people?

243
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,067
One of those crystal ball people?

244
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,357
Well, look into your crystal
ball and see that I'm innocent.

245
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:28,650
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Right, you just rob them.

246
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,507
That's what I do.
I'm a thief. But I'm not a killer.

247
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,780
I had a partner in this
one, Gord Delbecchio.

248
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,980
Gord wanted me to break into the
basement and disarm the alarm, so I did.

249
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,360
Woman was killed in the
bedroom on the second floor.

250
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,030
- And I swear I never even saw the lady.
- Sure. That's why you ran?

251
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,810
If I was guilty, do you really think
I would have stayed in this town?

252
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,217
- That's what your attorney is for.
- I don't have some slick attorney.

253
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,592
I don't even have an attorney, man.
I got a public defender.

254
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,590
You know, I'm probably facing
the chair on this one.

255
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,600
Why didn't you tell the
cops about Delbecchio?

256
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,467
If I let the cops try to find
him, he'd be long gone by now.

257
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,460
Aw, that looks painful.

258
00:13:11,468 --> 00:13:15,080
So let me get this straight.
You just let him get away.

259
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,200
There was nothing I could do.
He drove off in a car.

260
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,320
Did you manage to get a plate?

261
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,430
No. But it was a blue echo.
It was a child's car.

262
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,260
He was with those idiots, you know?
The psychic and the other idiot.

263
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,938
Lassie, what's happening? It's Lassie.

264
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,501
Yes.

265
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,630
Yes, I do know what
uncertain terms are.

266
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,857
- I'm the one that had to tell Gus.
- No, you listen to me, Spencer, all right?

267
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:47,135
You get back here now or I will charge
you both with harboring a fugitive.

268
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,490
Do you understand?

269
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,670
Wow, somebody didn't drink their
grateful juice this morning.

270
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,321
We're fine, okay? He's cuffed. I'm
bringing him back in. You're welcome.

271
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,830
Do me a favor, put Jules
on the phone for a second.

272
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,260
- Ooh, dude! Labradoodle.
- Where?

273
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,720
He wants to talk to you.

274
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,590
Shawn, where are you guys?
Let us send some black and whites.

275
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,730
You want a black and white cookie?

276
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,460
- Tancana, you want a cookie?
- Can't eat wheat or yeast.

277
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,000
Shawn, I'm serious.
Just stay where you are.

278
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,438
Yeah, so that we can't
collect the $50,000 bounty.

279
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,418
I don't think so. We're close, okay?

280
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,320
But answer me this.

281
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:20,510
What do you know about
a Klaus Delbecchio?

282
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:22,780
- Gord.
- Gord Delbecchio.

283
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,490
Shawn, don't buy into Tancana's story.

284
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,920
We have checked out
Delbecchio. He has a record.

285
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,922
He used to partner up with
Tancana, but he didn't this time, okay?

286
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,328
Just get in here. And be careful.

287
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,145
Admit it, you're a little turned on by
the whole bounty hunter thing, aren't you?

288
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,007
Come on. Shawn Spencer, bounty hunter?

289
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:43,106
I mean, I know the psychic thing is sexy.
I mean, that's a given. It's a sexy thing.

290
00:14:44,023 --> 00:14:46,226
Shawn Spencer, bounty hunter?

291
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,367
It's hot. It's hot!

292
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,811
Hello?

293
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,336
Jules?

294
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,756
Jules?

295
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,247
Is it because I'm not wearing a vest?

296
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,150
Is it the vest?

297
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,226
Hello?

298
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,030
I think she hung up, Shawn.

299
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,504
Look, we never made any actual
cash from the Cole robbery.

300
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,188
Delbecchio kept talking about
working something a lot bigger.

301
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,850
Said... bragging, blowing about
all the cash he was gonna make.

302
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:11,790
I think I know where's he's hiding out. It's
only, like, five minutes out of the way.

303
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,513
We swing by there, we check it out, and
you'll know I'll telling the truth.

304
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,577
Shawn, what are you doing?

305
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,580
What is that face, Shawn?
I don't like that face.

306
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,810
I'm sensing something, Gus.

307
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:24,869
That's what I do, I'm a psychic.
I sense things, remember?

308
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,830
No, Shawn, you're not doing
this to me again.

309
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,810
No, not this time. Not with a
criminal in the back of my car.

310
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,630
Gus, don't be a little
girl about this, okay?

311
00:15:31,652 --> 00:15:32,940
It's only gonna take five minutes.

312
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,860
I'm the one driving this car right now.

313
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:37,528
And this car is going to
the police station.

314
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,462
Where all the police are.

315
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,731
Hello?

316
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,340
Got it.

317
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,501
They've got him!

318
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,833
Downstairs in his car!

319
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,940
I wanna thank you for a very colorful and
eventful stint as a bounty hunter, Shawn.

320
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,080
But consider me retired.

321
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,470
Well, look at it this way.

322
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,280
Now you got a story if
you ever go on Letterman.

323
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,040
Terrific.

324
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:30,412
Now I'm gonna head home, take a long nap, and
wait for the bruises to show up on my wrist.

325
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:33,290
That actually sounds pretty good.
I'll come along.

326
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,610
It's been a long time since
we've napped together.

327
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:37,382
Let's make a quick stop first.

328
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,580
This is not a quick stop, Shawn!

329
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:49,050
Sorry, my dad's boat only goes so fast.

330
00:16:49,063 --> 00:16:51,384
I thought I was clear. I'm retired!

331
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,406
Will you stop doing that?

332
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,470
He said take a right at
Cabrillo, head for the pierto a house.

333
00:16:58,474 --> 00:17:00,730
You do realize we're
noton land anymore, right?

334
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:02,440
He said house.

335
00:17:02,457 --> 00:17:05,705
But what he meant was houseboat.

336
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,000
It's not a tourist spot.
That's not a fishing hole.

337
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,591
There's no reason to be there.

338
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm not getting on this boat, Shawn.

339
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,727
If Delbecchio's on the boat,
he can hear us.

340
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,392
Toss me that rope, buddy.

341
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,251
Thanks.

342
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,100
Now, listen, I'm okay with
you staying on the boat.

343
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,810
Just be careful of sharks.

344
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,357
I'm not suremy dad's
little skiff is shark safe.

345
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,210
Dude, I'm pretty sure this is
the boat from dead calm.

346
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:54,945
Great, now we have to
worry about Billy Zane too?

347
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,720
Psychic bloodhound just
couldn't leave it be, huh?

348
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:10,111
Easy, easy. Take it easy.

349
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:13,320
I told you back at the station I'm gonna
do what I have to do to clear my name.

350
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,590
If that's coming to Delbecchio's
hideout and finding the evidence,

351
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:17,170
that's what I'm gonna do.

352
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:21,500
Okay. Why don't you just put
down the fish bonker...

353
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,492
You're making Gus very nervous.

354
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,303
And let me do what it is I do, Dwayne.

355
00:18:27,513 --> 00:18:29,230
I can help you.

356
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,006
All right. Take a shot.

357
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,191
Thank you.

358
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,521
Look at that.

359
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,271
Money bands.

360
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,430
Usually used to pack 2 or $3,000 stacks.

361
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,350
I told you he was
working on some cash deal.

362
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,060
Yes, you did. I think
I just found his phone.

363
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,876
Well, turn it on. What do you got?

364
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,030
Battery's dead.

365
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,856
Just hold on to it.

366
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:28,540
I believe Isabella Cole was
wearing this when she was killed.

367
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,189
That puts Delbecchio at least close
enough to the body to snatch this off.

368
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:33,306
It's evidence.

369
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,998
Circumstantial, but it
could lead to something.

370
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,381
It's Byrd!

371
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:44,453
- Hello?
- Shawn?

372
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:45,528
- Dad!
- Yeah, hey, Shawn.

373
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,580
You still coming over
for dinner tonight?

374
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,411
Hold on a sec.

375
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,990
Are will still going to
dinner at my dad's tonight?

376
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,580
Uh, look, we're gonna have to
get back to you on that, dad.

377
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:54,376
- We're in the middle of something.
- Sounds like you're on a boat.

378
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,960
- Was that a gunshot?
- No, don't be ridiculous.

379
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,108
We're just... we're sitting in the
psych office watching a movie.

380
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,110
"Midnight Run". Have you seen it?

381
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,006
Give it up, peons!

382
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,256
I got this. I got this!

383
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,213
Open it up! I will shoot you!

384
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,760
Open it!

385
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,950
Let's go!

386
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,676
We are out of here!

387
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,660
- You didn't tie up the boat?
- Me?

388
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,100
Last guy out the boatties it up!
Everyone knows that!

389
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,030
You asked for the rope!

390
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,510
Why would you ask for the rope if you
didn't intend on tying it up, Shawn?

391
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:48,814
What are you, the ambassador
of rope etiquette?

392
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,399
Did he just wink at me?

393
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,873
This time... I really am
gonna shoot you guys.

394
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,690
Shawn, if we ever get out of
this alive, I'm gonna kill you!

395
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,077
You've got to be kidding me!

396
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:29,859
How can a man that big
have so much stamina?

397
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,982
I'm a psychic!

398
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,856
I can tell you where he's going!

399
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,540
I told you she'd be here.

400
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:51,080
Wow, she really is taking this to heart.

401
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,720
Hey, Jules, you okay?

402
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,310
Juliet.

403
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,540
What are you doing here?

404
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:02,210
Catching up on some summer reading?

405
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,560
Gus and I were almost
murdered here earlier,

406
00:22:04,577 --> 00:22:07,389
so we came back
for sentimental reasons.

407
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,829
Do you know what it's
like to have an internal voice

408
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,190
that tells you what the right thing
to do is all of the time and you do it,

409
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:18,700
and it works and you're good at what you
do, and then one day it just shuts off?

410
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,260
And in that moment there is no voice,
and you just have to listen to yourself.

411
00:22:22,264 --> 00:22:25,302
And in an instant, in a
millisecond, you make a tiny,

412
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:29,190
but crucial mistake and screw up
so badly it affects your whole life?

413
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:30,820
No, I do not.

414
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,570
But Gus here might.

415
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,000
Look, I promise you, we're gonna find him.

416
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:37,150
And we're gonna bring him back in.

417
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,030
How are you gonna do that, Shawn?

418
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,360
Because I have been through everything.

419
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:43,640
I have combed these photos over
and over again looking for anything,

420
00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:46,588
any clues, and I keep coming up
with a big, fat zero.

421
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,641
So what are you doing?
You're just giving up?

422
00:22:49,656 --> 00:22:52,050
No, I just have to go back to the
station to deal with something.

423
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,411
Be my guest.

424
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,040
They photographed his tattoos.

425
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,810
Look at this one.

426
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,970
It looks handmade,
like a prison tattoo.

427
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,131
Barb.

428
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,480
It could be a girlfriend or an ex.

429
00:23:13,502 --> 00:23:16,710
We can cross check for women named Barb or
Barbara who may have run in his circles.

430
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,330
He could be hiding out with her.

431
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,750
BARB

432
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,950
Bar 13

433
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,994
- Gus?
- What?

434
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:30,620
You're a genius.

435
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,910
Bar 13

436
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,730
Not exactly family friendly here.

437
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,500
Just pretend like we're in road house.

438
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,022
Fine, but I'm Patrick Swayze.

439
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,290
Sam Elliott.

440
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,410
Excuse me, good sir?

441
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,650
I'd like to see a list of your
california whites, please.

442
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,010
Listen, I don't know which
fraternity dared you to walk in here,

443
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,597
but you better run on back to campus

444
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:12,450
before you get beat so
bad, it's gonna hurt to cry.

445
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:14,640
Actually, we're meeting a friend here.

446
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,110
Dwayne Tancana.

447
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,170
You know him?

448
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:18,160
Never heard of him.

449
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:19,890
Mm, bummer. Let's go.

450
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,030
Dude, I got this. Really!

451
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,550
I don't think you're telling
methe truth, giant guy.

452
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,580
I know he's here. About yay high,
covered in tats. Pisces. Loves to run.

453
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,701
Look, let's not play games.

454
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,540
Don't embarrass yourself with
this tough guy routine.

455
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:36,160
Tell you what, I'm gonna count to three.

456
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,821
One.

457
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,895
Two.

458
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,332
Nice work, Shawn.

459
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
I got it!

460
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,511
I said, I got it.

461
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,061
There you are!

462
00:24:59,076 --> 00:25:02,130
They came here looking
for me, so I got it.

463
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:03,452
Now let'em down.

464
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,460
Let me go! Let me... stop! Let me go!

465
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,351
You're lucky.

466
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:14,820
And maybe next time you might
think about a tic-tac.

467
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,560
I gotta say, I'm impressed, Shawn.

468
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,140
Beginning to believe this
whole psychic ability thing.

469
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:21,370
You tracked me here.

470
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,250
That is impressive.

471
00:25:23,267 --> 00:25:24,610
- Dwayne.
- Mm-hmm?

472
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:26,520
What I really need from you

473
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:33,042
is to let us take you back to the
police station and into custody?

474
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,620
If you two try to take me in,
my friends will kill you.

475
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,270
And if by somes trange stroke of luck,

476
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,495
you manage to get me
hand cuffed, I'll escape,

477
00:25:47,525 --> 00:25:49,567
because I've done it before.

478
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:52,080
Dude, that's what we forgot. Cuffs.

479
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,316
There's a way out, though.

480
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,300
I'll walk out the front door
with you, just the three of us.

481
00:25:58,313 --> 00:26:02,600
If... if you use your psychic
ability to help me find Delbecchio.

482
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:03,950
Prove my innocence.

483
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:06,200
So, you got a decision to make.

484
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:08,220
Are you going to
accept my generous offer,

485
00:26:08,257 --> 00:26:10,180
or am I gonna turn
you over to my friends?

486
00:26:10,197 --> 00:26:11,610
They don't play nice.

487
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,620
I'll do it.

488
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:15,260
- One condition.
- What?

489
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,150
I get that guy's vest.

490
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,930
All right, first things first.

491
00:26:20,942 --> 00:26:23,273
Swing by the psych office,
plug in Delbecchio's phone,

492
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,000
see if anything survived the
water damage caused by Gus.

493
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,420
Caused?

494
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:28,600
That I caused?

495
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:29,810
That I caused?

496
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,720
Maybe if someone would
have tied up the boat,

497
00:26:31,721 --> 00:26:34,740
we wouldn't have been swimming
around like the couple from open water.

498
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,960
There's one guy right there at the dock.

499
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,340
- Did you run the registration?
- Yes, it just came through.

500
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:48,750
It's registered to
Delbecchio since 2001.

501
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,020
All right, good work, detective.

502
00:26:50,057 --> 00:26:53,320
Gonna comb this place for Tancana's prints.
He must be after Delbecchio for some reason.

503
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,730
Okay. Good.

504
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:04,710
Duck, it's Byrd!

505
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:07,970
Great, now we can't even
goto our own office?

506
00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:09,607
Byrd is stalking us now.

507
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,320
We're harboring a fugitive, Shawn.

508
00:27:11,322 --> 00:27:13,020
Where are we gonna go with a fugitive?

509
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,480
Yeah, you can...
you can play with that.

510
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,521
Gus!

511
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,886
Dude, would you hurry up?
Just dry it off already.

512
00:27:25,901 --> 00:27:29,010
- I'm not sure when my dad's getting home.
- I can't will it to dry faster, Shawn.

513
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:31,750
And I'm not plugging this inuntil all
signs of moisture have been cleared.

514
00:27:31,788 --> 00:27:34,090
I cheated death three times
in the last seven hours.

515
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:37,900
And I'm not going out by electrocution.
I thought you said we were safe here, anyway.

516
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,738
Look, I know he'sat the grocery
store getting stuff for the dinner,

517
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,580
but I can't will him to spend more
time squeezing melons, now can I?

518
00:27:45,518 --> 00:27:47,070
- Really?
- Oh, hey, Shawn!

519
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:50,130
- Hey, dad!
- You're early, aren't you?

520
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:51,732
Oh, we're excited! We're gonna eat.

521
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,031
- We're gonna...
- Guster!

522
00:27:53,032 --> 00:27:55,560
What are you doing messing
around with my crap over there? Stop.

523
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:58,816
Oh, I'm just charging my phone.
I hope you don't mind.

524
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,337
And who's this?

525
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:06,740
Oh, this is,um...
uh, this is an old, uh...

526
00:28:06,758 --> 00:28:11,430
- Camp counselor of Gus and mine.
- Oh, camp counselor, huh?

527
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,830
Yeah, he rolled into town, looked us up.
Gave us a call. How fun is that, huh?

528
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,590
Get over here and meet my pop.
This is, uh, white feather.

529
00:28:20,593 --> 00:28:21,736
Pleased to meet you, pop.

530
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:24,080
Well, pleased to meet
you too, white feather.

531
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,432
What camp was that again?

532
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:28,250
Oh, dad, you don't rember
anything from my childhood.

533
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:32,540
It's camp tiki... mama... jama.

534
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:34,920
- Tikihama.
- Tikihama! Exactly!

535
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:39,410
And white feather here was
very good to us kids back then.

536
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:41,860
Is Mr. White feather going
to be joining us for dinner?

537
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:43,101
What are you serving?

538
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,651
Skirt steak.

539
00:28:44,937 --> 00:28:45,900
Oh, no.

540
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:48,520
He can't eat that.
Do you have egg whites?

541
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:52,770
So I'm gonna go ahead and let you two get
more acquainted. 'Cause that feels right.

542
00:28:52,787 --> 00:28:54,400
- I mean,that just feels good.
- Shawn.

543
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:56,100
- And you can tell...
- Shawn!

544
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,760
... about all our good
times at camp Tikibarber.

545
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,980
I still can't get it to work.

546
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,850
How long do you think
Tancanacan stall in there?

547
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:07,110
Not long.

548
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,676
Wait, I got it.

549
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,686
That's all that's left?

550
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:13,320
Yeah, that's what happens when
you drop cell phones in water.

551
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,085
Shawn.

552
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,780
I need some paper.

553
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,254
All right, look, clearly he's
either dropping off or picking up.

554
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,399
Money from someone... somewhere.

555
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,890
So you were Shawn's camp counselor?

556
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,990
Camp?

557
00:29:27,011 --> 00:29:28,860
Oh, yeah, yeah. Camp counselor, yeah.

558
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:30,370
Yeah... oh, I remember Shawn.

559
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,290
Yeah, he was a great kid.
Wonderful kid.

560
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,700
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

561
00:29:33,717 --> 00:29:35,476
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

562
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,800
Had lots of camp spirit.

563
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,270
Team player.

564
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,170
Oh, a real stickler for the rules.

565
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,640
Is that right?

566
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:46,800
Okay, go ahead. Pick a letter.

567
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,460
Shawn, seriously,
I don't wanna play games.

568
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,443
- Can we just...
- Pick a letter, Gus.

569
00:29:49,473 --> 00:29:50,210
- Shawn.
- Any letter.

570
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,995
- No.
- Pick a letter.

571
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,107
- No.
- Gus, pick a letter.

572
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,160
- Pick. Pick. Pick.
- No. No. No.

573
00:29:54,203 --> 00:29:55,670
- Gus!
- T, I pick T.

574
00:29:55,684 --> 00:29:56,650
There's no T.

575
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:57,550
- U.
- No.

576
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,356
- L.
- Uh-uh.

577
00:29:58,386 --> 00:29:59,224
- J.
- No.

578
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:00,000
- N.
- No.

579
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:00,773
- X.
- No.

580
00:30:00,788 --> 00:30:02,280
Shawn, have you already
solved the puzzle?

581
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:04,822
First of all, you're dead.

582
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,430
Secondly, of course I solved the puzzle.
The second that I saw it.

583
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:11,940
- Meadow park.
- I don't have a hi-top fade, Shawn.

584
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,590
Google Meadow park.

585
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,040
So Delbecchio was meeting someone
in the park to drop off money?

586
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,260
This camp, what were you a,
uh, counselor for?

587
00:30:24,932 --> 00:30:27,200
Archery and drama.

588
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,590
Drama, really.

589
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:29,700
Like what?

590
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,850
Oh, original stuff, you know.

591
00:30:32,868 --> 00:30:36,430
Um, musical-y things.

592
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,760
Camp songs, we... a lot of camp songs.

593
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,426
Oh, really? How neat.

594
00:30:40,442 --> 00:30:41,710
You remember any of it?

595
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,470
- What, the songs?
- Yeah.

596
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,718
No, it was a long time ago.

597
00:30:45,763 --> 00:30:47,282
Nah, come on, I'm sure you
remember something.

598
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,336
I'd love to hear it.

599
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,052
Take me right back to
my kid's camp days.

600
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,400
They grow up so quick.

601
00:30:51,412 --> 00:30:53,520
- I don't remember any.
- Sing!

602
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,510
I can't.

603
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,655
Sing!

604
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,543
Oh Tikihama.

605
00:31:02,451 --> 00:31:05,473
Oh what you are

606
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,877
reaches nearand spreads out far

607
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:14,900
camp Tikihama.

608
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,420
Great, no meadow park.

609
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,830
I searched everything within
50 square miles and nothing.

610
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:23,000
- You reach us near.
- Is he singin'in there?

611
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:24,020
- ING.
- What?

612
00:31:24,036 --> 00:31:25,300
Gus, ING.

613
00:31:25,692 --> 00:31:28,188
And I-N-G to the end. Hit search.

614
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:32,190
To crystal lakes sing out loud

615
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,158
Meadow parking.

616
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,320
Shawn. Shawn.

617
00:31:36,332 --> 00:31:37,870
Who is this guy in my kitchen?

618
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,020
All right, look, dad, let me explain.

619
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:39,810
No, don't, don't.

620
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,788
Don't say another word.
I don't wanna know.

621
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:47,682
Just get whatever it is out of my house
before I have to call someone or some agency.

622
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,160
Gus, Gus, slow down.

623
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,626
What the heck?

624
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:59,320
I'm sensing we just found Delbecchio.

625
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,590
Well, there goes my alibi.

626
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,100
- What are you doing?
- No touchy dead body, Shawn.

627
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,486
That was really fast.

628
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,600
Gus, come here, quick.

629
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,562
- No.
- Get out of the car. Come here.

630
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,500
I'm not coming out there.

631
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:52,450
- Would you get out of the car?
- Make me.

632
00:32:52,464 --> 00:32:54,610
Get out of the car!

633
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:03,458
Okay, I need you to get out of the car.

634
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,667
I need... the super sniffer.

635
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,240
I'm not smelling some
dead guy's finger, Shawn.

636
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:15,950
Me put this super smeller up
to some dead guy... oh, my.

637
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:21,910
Is that... Oh, no he didn't.

638
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:31,680
I'll be... I've smelled that before!

639
00:33:31,714 --> 00:33:32,720
I knew it!

640
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:35,578
We have got to find Byrd before
he can turn in Tancana.

641
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,576
How?

642
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,240
It's not like we have $50,000
in a briefcase somewhere.

643
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,672
- Nice, buddy.
- What?

644
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,350
What?

645
00:33:49,379 --> 00:33:53,810
So are you planning on letting me in
any time soon on what your plan is from here?

646
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,770
Gus, you don't want this to be
a repeat of the time.

647
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,630
I told you what happened
at the end of war games.

648
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,130
You didn't talk to me for a week.

649
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,570
Just wait, it's better.
What's in there, anyway?

650
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:03,100
A bunch of expire deczema swabs.

651
00:34:03,115 --> 00:34:04,484
It's all I could find in
the back of your car.

652
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:06,198
Yo, Byrd!

653
00:34:06,792 --> 00:34:09,240
Ah, Spencer, what a surprise.

654
00:34:09,241 --> 00:34:10,732
Yeah, I'm chock full of 'em.

655
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,086
- Hey, what are you doing right now?
- Oh, right now.

656
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:16,289
I'm about 30 seconds away from
collecting 50,000 bucks,

657
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:17,527
that's what I'm doing.

658
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,890
Ooh, $50,000.

659
00:34:19,903 --> 00:34:22,110
Nice, that's very exciting.

660
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,880
That's a lot of shot
glasses that say "Byrd" on them.

661
00:34:24,893 --> 00:34:26,833
Get to the point, Spencer.
And make it fast.

662
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,566
Well, maybe you didn't know this.

663
00:34:28,596 --> 00:34:31,490
But there's a whole lot of money
stashed away from the robbery.

664
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:34,080
Yeah, Tancana told us where it was.

665
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,190
And now all that
money is in my briefcase.

666
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,110
Is this a briefcase or an attache?

667
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:44,002
I think it's a briefcase.
Attaches have a softer shell.

668
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,420
Really, that's all that
differentiates them, a softer shell?

669
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:48,990
Well, attache does
have a better ring to it.

670
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,860
Let's go with attache.

671
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:52,050
Get to it, Spencer.

672
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:54,120
Look, you said this was
your last hurrah, right?

673
00:34:54,137 --> 00:34:56,800
Why not make it a really,
really fat one?

674
00:34:56,819 --> 00:35:01,570
We'll trade you what's in the
attache for Tancana, straight up.

675
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,080
Win-win.

676
00:35:03,111 --> 00:35:05,000
Now, would I wanna do that?

677
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:09,373
Because what's in the attache...
attache sounds pretentious, dude.

678
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:11,000
Well, it could be the
way you're saying it.

679
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:12,810
- You say it.
- Attache.

680
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,990
What's in the briefcase is four times
more than what Cole's gonna pay you.

681
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,060
And for those of you playing
along at home, that's $200,000.

682
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,381
So why wouldn't you take the money?
You allergic?

683
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:26,000
No, we love money.
Particularly Gus.

684
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:27,900
But this time we're not doing it
for the money.

685
00:35:27,923 --> 00:35:29,330
We're doing it for the girl.

686
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:30,976
You know what, Shawn, let's
get out of here.

687
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:35,170
This guy wouldn't know a good deal if it bit him
in the seat of his Han Solo action figure pants.

688
00:35:35,187 --> 00:35:36,520
No, wait wait wait wait wait.

689
00:35:36,556 --> 00:35:37,630
Wait.

690
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,010
Fine. Toss me the money.

691
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,044
You think this is my
first money-for-hostage exchange?

692
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,420
No.

693
00:35:48,441 --> 00:35:53,630
First you give us Tancana, and then...
Gus tosses you the briefcase.

694
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,298
No, I wanna see the money first.

695
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:59,859
Sure, and why don't we just invite the whole police
force out to count it for you while we're at it?

696
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:03,032
- Yoo-hoo.
- Same time, Byrd.

697
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:04,310
Same time.

698
00:36:04,903 --> 00:36:06,340
I'll count to three.

699
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:11,580
One... two... three.

700
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,512
What the hell is this?

701
00:36:23,238 --> 00:36:25,810
That was your big plan?
Really? Really, Shawn?

702
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:28,030
No, this was the plan.

703
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,730
Why is he winking at me?

704
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:35,150
It's involuntary.

705
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,806
You got him. Thank god.

706
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,010
What kind of an idiot pulls a
gun in front of a police station?

707
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,160
Drop it, Byrd.

708
00:36:41,175 --> 00:36:42,880
I have a license to carry.

709
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:44,200
I'm licensed to arrest.

710
00:36:44,222 --> 00:36:46,582
Now, as much as I've thought about
shooting these two from time to time,

711
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,020
you cannot pull a gun on
innocent civilians.

712
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,796
So drop it!

713
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:53,490
Down on your knees.
Hands behind your head.

714
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,080
Let's take you inside to
cool off, bounty hunter.

715
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,710
Pass me the satchel.

716
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,704
Ooh, satchel!
I didn't think of that one.

717
00:37:01,734 --> 00:37:04,070
I think things are gonna go a
little differently this time.

718
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:05,251
Let's go.

719
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,860
Thank you.
I'm sorry, I doubted you guys.

720
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,770
It's okay.
We all make mistakes.

721
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,560
What do you think, buddy?
How about that nap?

722
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:23,310
Shawn, are you forgetting something?
I know. You need a night-light.

723
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:24,316
Shawn!

724
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,571
Oh, right.

725
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,560
Whoa, guys! Hold up, hold up!

726
00:37:30,587 --> 00:37:33,368
Sorry, with the whole guns drawn thing

727
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:35,850
and all the screaming and
Byrd's ridiculous feathery hair,

728
00:37:35,866 --> 00:37:39,340
I forgot to tell you...
you got the wrong guy.

729
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,360
And it's not just a
murder, it's a double murder.

730
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:47,170
- What the hell are you talking about?
- It's Cole! It's Loman Cole!

731
00:37:47,193 --> 00:37:49,042
He must have been planning on
murdering his wife,

732
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,344
because he used the break-in as the
perfect opportunity to strangle her.

733
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,390
And pin it on Tancana, a career
criminal, who would go down easy, right?

734
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,540
I have no idea what you're talking about.

735
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,670
He even knocked himself out with
a vase to sell the break-in.

736
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,400
Because you can't be blamed for
murder when you're unconscious.

737
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:08,590
What you didn't know was that Tancana
wasn't alone in the house that night.

738
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:13,480
His partner, Delbecchio, was on the second
floor. And he's the one who actually saw you.

739
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,540
He stole the necklace off your dead
wife's body, may she rest in peace.

740
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,800
So he contacted you, told you
that he saw you kill your wife,

741
00:38:22,812 --> 00:38:25,170
and blackmailed you in
exchange for his silence.

742
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:27,630
Delbecchio kept talking about
working something bigger.

743
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:30,050
Blowing about all the
cash he was gonna make.

744
00:38:30,364 --> 00:38:32,000
You paid him once.

745
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,830
But then he wanted more.

746
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:37,760
So you set up a drop-off
at the meadow parking garage.

747
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:41,450
And that's where you applied the
old Cole specialty move.

748
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,987
The strangle.

749
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:47,290
And you might have gotten away with it
if it wasn't for your own greediness.

750
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,470
What greediness?
I have all the money I need.

751
00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:54,440
Not greediness for money.
Greediness for fabulous hair.

752
00:38:54,455 --> 00:38:57,770
Unlike your poor, defenseless
wife, Delbecchio fought back.

753
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:00,540
Oh, I can see it. I can see it
very clearly now!

754
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,880
But mostly... Mostly I can smell it?

755
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,840
All over Delbecchio's hands.

756
00:39:08,843 --> 00:39:09,900
Smell what?

757
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:11,570
Who smells ginger blossoms?

758
00:39:11,595 --> 00:39:13,380
- I do.
- It's unmistakable.

759
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,390
It's hair gel.

760
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,220
Kangaroo paste.

761
00:39:17,252 --> 00:39:20,650
Trust me, if you swab Delbecchio's
hands and Cole's hair,

762
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,930
you'll see that he was there.

763
00:39:22,963 --> 00:39:25,560
Psychic bullcrap. Huh?

764
00:39:25,594 --> 00:39:28,280
- Do you have an alibi?
- I don't need an alibi, I'm not guilty.

765
00:39:28,281 --> 00:39:29,670
Oh, well, that's okay.

766
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:32,340
'Cause we can just look at the security
cameras from the parking garage.

767
00:39:32,378 --> 00:39:36,390
- There were no cameras in that parking gara...
- Oh.

768
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,600
Cuff him, detective O'Hara.

769
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,600
Got some questions for you
in the interrogation room.

770
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,290
I, uh... guess that
takes care of everybody.

771
00:39:44,656 --> 00:39:47,950
Okay, Tancana, you may have
beaten the murder rap,

772
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:50,820
but you're gonna do some time
for that robbery and that escape.

773
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,840
Well, robbery over murder,
that's better, right?

774
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:54,392
What are you guys, pals now?

775
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:56,320
I'm sorry to break up
this tender moment,

776
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,104
but don't think I'm not gonna be
really looking closely into the crap

777
00:39:59,134 --> 00:40:01,170
you two must have
pulled in the last 14 hours.

778
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,904
You know, when you reprimand us,
you might try using your feeling voice.

779
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,694
Yeah.

780
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:11,290
- Otherwise, all we hear is...
- The vest looks good.

781
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,010
Shut up.

782
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,136
Shawn.

783
00:40:25,566 --> 00:40:28,640
Look, I really screwed up today.

784
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:31,340
And I just wanna say thank
you for being there for me.

785
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:32,770
It really meant a lot.

786
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,690
It was a mistake.

787
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,560
That's what friends are for.

788
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,810
Yeah.

789
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,750
Well, it's been a long day.

790
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,912
Well, I guess you have to get
home and feed your parrot.

791
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,680
Shawn, I don't have a parrot.

792
00:40:50,712 --> 00:40:53,684
Well, in that case...

793
00:40:55,928 --> 00:40:57,190
Shawn, what are you doing?

794
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,236
- Nothing.
- Really?

795
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:00,757
Because if you're doing what
it looks like you're doing,

796
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,950
it's gonna be one of those things
we were just talking about.

797
00:41:02,978 --> 00:41:04,320
- What's that?
- A mistake.

798
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,430
I agree, but that's clearly
not what we're doing.

799
00:41:07,454 --> 00:41:09,300
Okay. Really?

800
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,300
What do you say that we're doing?

801
00:41:11,322 --> 00:41:14,660
I call it very close talking.

802
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,460
Ah, I see.

803
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,480
Do you have anything else to say?

804
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:26,720
Mm... no.

805
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,300
I think I'm good for now.

806
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,556
Well, good night.

807
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:38,211
'Night, detective.
