1
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:05,728
Turn around.

2
00:00:10,396 --> 00:00:12,219
Ooh, did you get me a pinata?

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,346
Nope.

4
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:15,187
- Pepsi challenge?
- Nope.

5
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:16,682
Am I being executed?

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,507
Just a little experiment.

7
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:21,590
It's said that when you're deprived
of one of your five senses,

8
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:23,898
the other four compensate
by becoming sharper.

9
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:27,234
Now, I know I usually test you
on what you can see, but today

10
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,175
I want you to tell me
what you can hear.

11
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:32,948
Ready?

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,805
All right.
Tell me what you heard.

13
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,058
Well, you went from
the fridge to the stove.

14
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:02,770
Then you picked something up
and threw it in the trash.

15
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,189
Excellent.
Take off your blindfold.

16
00:01:06,994 --> 00:01:08,245
Hey, my report!

17
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,819
You threw it in the trash.
Why?

18
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,947
Because it wasn't your report.
I saw you get it from Gus.

19
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,783
Now you're gonna do
the report yourself.

20
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,493
Next thing I want to hear is
the sound of that pencil

21
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:20,454
moving across your paper.

22
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,042
I'd rather be executed.

23
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,414
It's just stupid, that's all.

24
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:35,253
If he didn't have any hair, no one had
any business calling him fuzzy wuzzy.

25
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:37,887
- They were being ironic, shawn.
- Yeah, but he wasn't fuzzy, was he?

26
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:39,820
No, he wasn't.
Irony, Shawn.

27
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:42,632
- My point precisely.
- Hey, Shawn.

28
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,737
- What are you doing here?
- We were out for a stroll.

29
00:01:45,862 --> 00:01:47,530
Figured we'd stop in
for a social call.

30
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:49,508
Plus, Gus left his
retainer in the break room.

31
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:51,610
You came here
in a torrential rainstorm for that?

32
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,913
Okay, truth is we were bored.

33
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:56,988
The storm knocked out our cable.
Gus wouldn't play boggle or cranium.

34
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,861
I said I would play some cranium.
The storm didn't knock out our cable.

35
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,823
- Shawn didn't pay the bill.
- Would have.

36
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:04,074
The storm would have
knocked out our cable.

37
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:06,339
You said it yourself, jules.
It's torrential out there.

38
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,293
The reason we're here
is to pick up the check

39
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,208
from our last case so we can get
our cable turned back on.

40
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:15,808
The weather has dampened
my psychic powers,

41
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:18,698
but I am sensing that something big
is about to come through that door.

42
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,589
Huge! We just got
a call from Lassiter.

43
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:22,831
He arrested Ernesto Ramos Chavez
20 minutes ago.

44
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:24,768
He is second in command
of the cinco reyes.

45
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,895
So he plays the big guitar
in the mariachi band?

46
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,698
No, Shawn, cinco reyes.

47
00:02:28,823 --> 00:02:29,702
Five kings.

48
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:31,942
They're one of the most
dangerous gangs in our country.

49
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,152
Very good.

50
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,112
Lassiter busted him
several years ago,

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,031
but the DA couldn't make the charges
stick, so he just dropped off the radar.

52
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,481
But since then we've gotten
hard evidence on Chavez

53
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:42,430
that links him to a whole
lotta nasty stuff.

54
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:45,748
Nough to put him away for good.
Lassiter did a great thing today.

55
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:47,833
He's here!

56
00:03:07,947 --> 00:03:10,324
Come on, dude,
this is way better than cable.

57
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:11,890
I don't know.

58
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:14,495
Ultimately,
he's just another bad guy.

59
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:20,183
Book him.

60
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,514
I got a tip from an informant
that chavez had finally resurfaced.

61
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,464
I tracked him to the quick shop.

62
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,389
Took a position at the front door.

63
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,728
His only way out was through me.

64
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:48,360
The clerk said it'll take a few
more minutes to process our check.

65
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:49,353
Do you mind?

66
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,022
The man is telling his story.
Go ahead.

67
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:55,662
So I walked up to him, said,
"Good to see you again, Chavez.

68
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:57,580
You're coming with me."

69
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,130
He said, "just you?"

70
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,923
And I said, "just me."

71
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:03,137
Uh, just to be clear.

72
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,036
Are we talking about the quick shop
on las palmas or on princeton?

73
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,431
What's the difference?

74
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:09,829
Let's say, for example,
that you'd like a bag of funyuns.

75
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:11,416
Gonna have to go to Las Palmas.

76
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,579
- Princeton doesn't stock them.
- Don't ask me why.

77
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:16,792
- Who doesn't love funyuns?
- It was the one on Las Palmas.

78
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:19,023
But I had more important
things on my mind than chips.

79
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:21,517
Naturally, you were apprehending
a very dangerous

80
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:25,138
- criminal from the cincos, right?
- Yeah, reyes.

81
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,803
But just so you know,

82
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,644
- funyuns aren't actually a chip.
- Shawn, enough with the funyuns.

83
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,064
- They are an onion-flavored corn snack.
- And, for the record, they are fun.

84
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,345
That's enough from us.
We're being rude.

85
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:38,652
So how does it feel?

86
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,655
You guys in the gang unit couldn't
catch chavez and lassiter did.

87
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,001
Yeah, whatever.

88
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:45,657
Hey, made our job easier.

89
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:47,892
- Kudos, Lassiter.
- Thanks, Drimmer.

90
00:04:48,017 --> 00:04:50,082
Detective lassiter,
may I see you in my office?

91
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,207
You bet.

92
00:04:51,644 --> 00:04:54,657
Probably wants to give me
a commendation or something.

93
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:57,537
Probably gonna make
you a cop and a half.

94
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,416
You deserve it, Carlton.

95
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,693
Hey, I win, we all win.

96
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:09,269
Detective, I'd like to introduce
agents Whieldon and Rupp.

97
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:12,135
They're from the FBI
national gang task force.

98
00:05:12,904 --> 00:05:14,072
Agents.

99
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:16,519
Good of you to be here.
It's been quite a night.

100
00:05:16,644 --> 00:05:18,949
We choppered right in when
we heard about the arrest.

101
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:22,273
Ernesto chavez has been
a high-profile target for a long time.

102
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:24,114
It's just a perfect
storm of good timing.

103
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,433
Even better footwork.

104
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,208
But you didn't have to travel all
the way up here to congratulate me.

105
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:31,997
We didn't.
We're here for Chavez.

106
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:34,789
- Excuse me?
- We cut him a deal and he took it.

107
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:38,586
He's gonna turn state's witness against
the rest of the cinco reyes gang.

108
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:43,446
- You're just gonna let them take him?
- I'm sorry, detective.

109
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:45,969
But ernesto chavez's testimony
could have a profound

110
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,763
effect in dismantling
a major criminal enterprise.

111
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,762
I have not devoted countless man-hours
in pursuit of this scumbag

112
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:54,853
to have him comfortably live out
his days in some witness program.

113
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,188
- No way.
- I understand your frustration.

114
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,275
- He should be rotting in prison!
- But it's not your call to make,

115
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,371
Detective.

116
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:04,154
So why don't you run along
and fetch us our witness?

117
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,114
- Why don't you kiss my...
- Detective!

118
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,262
Combos, different story.

119
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:13,666
They are both pretzels and cheese,
and if you get one without cheese,

120
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:15,763
that means the bag is haunted.

121
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:18,134
Should have taken him out
when I had the chance.

122
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:20,420
What's that about?

123
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,272
Well, I got it, but get this.

124
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:24,820
The sergeant says that all
checks must be endorsed by chief vick.

125
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:27,135
Relax, buddy.
No reason to get all athwack.

126
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,345
- Athwack? That's not a word.
- It's viennesium.

127
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:30,888
That's not a language.

128
00:06:32,147 --> 00:06:34,209
- Chief, pressing matter.
- Oh, not now, spencer.

129
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:37,312
All I need is a signature and a pen.
Either of you guys have a bic?

130
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:39,285
Montblanc, paper mate?

131
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,910
I'll take a crayon.

132
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:45,087
Agents Whieldon and Rupp,
our department psychic, Shawn Spencer.

133
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:46,404
Very impressive work.

134
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:50,024
Usually takes me 15 minutes to work
lassiter up into that kind of lather.

135
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:51,726
Then I rinse and repeat.

136
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,470
See, guys, I'm not the only one
not paying bills.

<i>Psych 311
Lassie Did a Bad Bad Thing</i>

140
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:47,674
- He's dead.
- Damn it!

141
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,842
Get the coroner and forensics
down here right away.

142
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,697
What are you people staring at?
He's getting away.

143
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:55,139
You're standing over a dead man
with a gun in your hand.

144
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,684
- And?
- And I'd like to know what happened.

145
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,103
No time for that, chief.
Our shooter's in the building.

146
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,864
Make time, detective.

147
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:06,120
I was escorting chavez out of his
cell when the lights went off.

148
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:08,432
I was accosted from behind.
I drew my weapon.

149
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:10,571
I lost it in the scuffle.
I heard a shot,

150
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:12,311
the lights came on, Chavez was dead.

151
00:08:12,436 --> 00:08:14,832
I just retrieved my weapon
when you arrived on the scene.

152
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,829
Detective, that story's
a big load of crap.

153
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,414
Are you calling me a liar?

154
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,238
Oh, you picking up on that, genius?

155
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:23,326
Detective lassiter!

156
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,961
- Hold me back.
- Shawn, will you get serious?

157
00:08:26,086 --> 00:08:27,360
Lassiter just shot a guy.

158
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:29,273
Don't be ridiculous.
He didn't kill anyone.

159
00:08:29,398 --> 00:08:31,438
His finger wasn't
even on the trigger.

160
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,294
Stand down!

161
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,841
All of you!

162
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,908
Chief, I think it's obvious
what went down here.

163
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:43,162
Your detective just
wasted my lead witness.

164
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:46,315
And I would love to know what
you're gonna do about it.

165
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:51,786
Detective lassiter says he's not
the shooter, then I believe him.

166
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,095
Are you kidding me?

167
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,260
Thank you, chief.

168
00:08:54,598 --> 00:08:56,189
All right, everybody, listen up.

169
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:58,624
There's a good chance
our shooter is still in the building.

170
00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:01,209
- O'hara, you and I...
- O'hara, take three officers

171
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,124
and search the lower floor.
The rest of you,

172
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,835
I want this station
locked down tight.

173
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:08,454
Every window and exit covered.

174
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:10,854
Every room and air duct searched.

175
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:11,966
Move!

176
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:14,676
You, you, you.

177
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:18,472
We are gonna follow protocol
to the letter, detective.

178
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,684
Now, first,
I need to run ballistics on your weapon.

179
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:24,478
Right, of course.

180
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:28,263
Got it.

181
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:31,319
Now I need a full statement
from you in writing.

182
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,690
Good luck finding a pen.

183
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:35,072
All due respect, I would be
more useful in the search.

184
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,605
I wasn't asking.

185
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:46,678
Let's get outta here.
This is creeping me out.

186
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:48,169
Hold on a second.

187
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:51,213
Hey, where the hell are you going?
This is a crime scene.

188
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:54,091
I was looking for the bathroom.
Is that not the bathroom?

189
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,865
You know what, never mind.
I can hold it.

190
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,084
Unless you wanna fork over
one of those evidence bags.

191
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:00,473
Gimme a little privacy?

192
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:01,599
Out!

193
00:10:01,864 --> 00:10:02,704
Okay.

194
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:19,540
As far as we can tell, no one
has entered or exited the building.

195
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:22,787
Okay, we've done a complete search and
we have alibis from all staff present.

196
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,530
- And?
- Nothing.

197
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:28,117
I think it's time to have another
talk with detective Lassiter.

198
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:29,543
Don't you, chief?

199
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:33,380
Detective.

200
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:37,579
We need to go over some things,
so I need you to tell me again exactly

201
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,760
- what happened.
- It's all right here, chief.

202
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:41,410
Any word on the search?

203
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:45,476
Our shooter must have gotten through.
We've got to expand our perimeter.

204
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:48,205
Carlton, it's not as simple as that.

205
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,313
Have a seat.

206
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:54,735
Ocampo.

207
00:10:57,912 --> 00:11:00,908
- What's internal affairs doing here?
- Detective Lassiter.

208
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:05,146
I understand you've been going
through a difficult divorce.

209
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,929
I also see that you've been putting
in quite a lot of overtime lately.

210
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:10,042
Not to mention,

211
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:13,420
you have a higher than normal incidence
of discharging your weapon.

212
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:15,403
And you were overheard saying

213
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:17,609
you should have taken him out
when you had the chance.

214
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:19,451
Are you saying I am
actually a suspect?

215
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:20,886
You've got to be kidding me!

216
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:22,513
We need to do a gun residue swab

217
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,743
to make sure that it wasn't you
who fired the weapon.

218
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:26,647
We're just making sure.

219
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:30,562
Fine, but I am telling you
you are wasting your time.

220
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:33,399
- Chief, we need to speak.
- No, we don't.

221
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,880
The spirit world is abuzz
and my psychic vibes indicate, nay...

222
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:40,114
insist that lassiter
did not shoot chavez.

223
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,870
I mean, we all knew
that he would shoot somebody someday...

224
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,618
Oh, so you think he's capable of it?

225
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:47,287
No, he doesn't.
At most, lassiter would plant evidence.

226
00:11:47,455 --> 00:11:49,289
Would someone please get
them out of here?

227
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:50,620
I couldn't agree more.

228
00:11:51,104 --> 00:11:53,379
Don't worry, buddy,
we're all over this!

229
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:58,206
Look, I believe lassiter is innocent
too but we need hard

230
00:11:58,331 --> 00:11:59,946
evidence to exonerate him.

231
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:02,364
Not visions or vibrations
or whatever it is you have.

232
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,889
Chief, those are but two of
the arrows in my psychic quiver.

233
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:09,101
You have to go by the book on this one.
We understand.

234
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:11,752
- Thank you.
- Oh, chief, one more thing.

235
00:12:13,037 --> 00:12:15,899
Could you sign this check for us?
We're a little bit broke-ish.

236
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,747
You think she went back
inside to get a pen?

237
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:29,121
I'm still not convinced.

238
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,815
How can you be absolutely certain
that lassiter didn't shoot chavez?

239
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,475
It's relatively easy, gus.

240
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,933
I decided to be and therefore I am.

241
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:38,929
- Socrates said that.
- That was descartes.

242
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:41,508
- That's the cologne we wore in school.
- That was drakkar noir.

243
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:43,552
- No, that is a wine.
- That's pinot noir.

244
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:45,012
Hello.

245
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:46,138
Chief!

246
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,371
Welcome,
welcome to the fortress of solitude!

247
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:51,250
- Coffee?
- Oh, no, no, thank you.

248
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,645
No, I've had enough.
No more coffee.

249
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:56,749
I've been up all night and we still
haven't found any physical evidence

250
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:59,559
that this mystery
shooter ever existed.

251
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:00,872
And what's worse?

252
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,488
Ocampo got a hold of Lassiter's
psychological profile.

253
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:05,741
Wow, he really has it out for him.

254
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:08,452
Chief, those psych evals
are rarely accurate.

255
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,456
It was probably done by some crackpot
shrink with a fake swedish accent.

256
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:14,624
It was the one done by your mother.

257
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:15,834
Sweet baby J.

258
00:13:16,002 --> 00:13:18,253
Last night you said
that lassiter is innocent.

259
00:13:18,421 --> 00:13:19,796
- He is.
- Can you prove it?

260
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:20,964
Of course I can.

261
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:24,676
- Oh, you mean right now?
- Yes, now!

262
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:27,065
Ocampo has a warrant to
search lassiter's place

263
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,322
and he's headed over there right
now, and unless you

264
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:31,808
have something tangible,
I don't think I can stop this train.

265
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:33,372
Chief, I think you can.

266
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:35,604
I think you can.
I think you can.

267
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:37,771
Don't worry.

268
00:13:37,896 --> 00:13:40,025
I'll divine something to
get lassiter off the hook.

269
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:41,358
Let's go!

270
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:52,702
It's dedication.

271
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:54,711
It's creepy is what it is.

272
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:57,109
The lab results just came in.

273
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,054
I knew it.

274
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:03,437
Lassiter's hand tested
positive for G.S.R

275
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:04,566
Well, duh.

276
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:06,579
Lassiter always has G.S.R
on his hands.

277
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:08,501
He practically lives
at the shooting range.

278
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:10,147
Think he wants to hang around here?

279
00:14:10,272 --> 00:14:12,145
Ballistics says the bullet
that killed Chavez

280
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,809
definitely came from Lassiter's gun.

281
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:15,000
All right.

282
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:17,136
This may be a little
tougher than I thought.

283
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:18,122
Not for me.

284
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,086
Chief.

285
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:31,836
I didn't know you'd
be coming by today.

286
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:34,412
I actually hadn't planned to, but...

287
00:14:35,116 --> 00:14:36,386
Oh, no.

288
00:14:39,153 --> 00:14:41,294
Detective Lassiter,
you are the prime suspect

289
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:43,693
in the murder of Ernesto Ramon Chavez
and as of this moment

290
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:45,528
you are on suspension.

291
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,438
Please relinquish your badge.

292
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:54,771
Here, let me help you with this.

293
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:06,972
Thanks.

294
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:11,586
I know you didn't do this, buddy.

295
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,277
And I'm gonna do everything
I can to prove it.

296
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:15,460
I promise.

297
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:25,530
Hot cheese!

298
00:15:26,296 --> 00:15:28,473
{\pos(192,220)}Dude, you know that cheese
has gone bad?

299
00:15:28,598 --> 00:15:30,689
{\pos(192,220)}Contraire, mein herr,
it's gone good, very good.

300
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:32,636
{\pos(192,220)}Don't you know cheese is best
when it's aged?

301
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,628
{\pos(192,220)}I read somewhere
that a japanese business man

302
00:15:34,753 --> 00:15:36,932
spent a fortune on a 200-year
old wheel of Jarlsberg.

303
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:39,268
I think you're confusing that
with Monet'swater Lillies.

304
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,793
No, I'm pretty sure
it was a Jarlsberg.

305
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,295
Don't you people
ever clean up in here?

306
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,958
- This place is a sty.
- Lassie, what's up?

307
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:50,652
{\pos(192,220)}And the outfit, man.
What, are you back on the job already?

308
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:52,479
{\pos(192,220)}No, these are my civvies.

309
00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:54,653
{\pos(212,260)}They look exactly
like your work clothes.

310
00:15:54,793 --> 00:15:56,786
Hardly.
I'm wearing my suede bucks.

311
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,199
They're a casual gentleman's shoe.

312
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,019
A casual gentleman's shoe.
What are you, the great gatsby?

313
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:04,526
Gonna do a little swan watching
with daisy Buchanan later?

314
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:07,629
- How did you come up with that one?
- Eighth grade summer reading. What?

315
00:16:08,294 --> 00:16:11,626
Anyway, we're glad to see you.
What are you doing here?

316
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:15,188
I wanted to tell you how much
I appreciate you believing my innocence.

317
00:16:15,313 --> 00:16:17,515
Especially considering
how little I believe in you.

318
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:20,768
I'm starting my owninvestigation
and I want you on board.

319
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:22,687
- You're hiring us?
- Absolutely not.

320
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:25,302
- Then what are you doing?
- {\I'm giving you}Give you the chance to work with me.

321
00:16:25,427 --> 00:16:27,539
- But we do that all the time.
- Are you gonna help me{\ or not}?

322
00:16:27,664 --> 00:16:29,727
Of course we are.
You're like our brother.

323
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:30,927
Step-brother.

324
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,101
Weird kid who lives down the street,
eats nothing but mayonnaise on saltines?

325
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,677
Please, have a seat.

326
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,974
Before we get started, we always like
to ask a few preliminary questions.

327
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:46,168
- Standard stuff.
- Fire away.

328
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:49,212
Okay, well, let's see.
One, did you kill that guy?

329
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,550
- What?
- {\Guys, }This is {\kind of }a time-sensitive issue.

330
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:55,386
If I don't clear my name
in the next 24 hours, my chances

331
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:58,555
become very slim. {\Now }I need to know
your process. How do we get started?

332
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,450
- {\You }Really{\ wanna know my process}?
- Absolutely.

333
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:02,934
Usually starts with a holla
and ends with a creamsicle.

334
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:06,010
Then if there's time in between,
ThunderCats.

335
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:09,149
I'm dead.

336
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,698
The D.A. is already hounding me for this
report. I don't know how much longer

337
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:15,773
- I can hold her off.
- Hounding you?

338
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,995
When did that happen, Ocampo,
over drinks last night?

339
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Look...

340
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:24,846
I'm saying{\ is that} this is a highly sensitive
case. The sooner we clear it up,

341
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:27,248
- the better for all of us.
- I'm not signing off on anything

342
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:29,377
until a thorough investigation
is complete.

343
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:32,504
As far as I'm concerned,
the pretty little D.A. can wait.

344
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,771
Whatever you say, chief.

345
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:42,496
Chief, can I talk to you
for a second?

346
00:17:46,575 --> 00:17:48,939
- I don't trust that guy.
- {\Who, }Ocampo? Neither do I, he's a snake.

347
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:50,004
Exactly,

348
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:52,694
he's a politician. A guy like that
will screw anyone for an indictment,

349
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:56,272
- we can't let him do that to Lassiter.
- Detective, I'm handling this.

350
00:17:56,832 --> 00:17:58,908
And meanwhile,
you have cases to work.

351
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:01,167
<i>Chief, he's here.</i>

352
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:02,921
Send him in.

353
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:06,264
Look, O'Hara, you're distracted
and I can't have that.

354
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,333
So I'm assigning you a new partner.

355
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:13,965
He's one of the best detectives that
I've got, he's willing to help us out.

356
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:16,584
Look, O'Hara, I know this situation

357
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:18,544
is... weird.

358
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:21,929
All I can do is try to be as capable
as your former partner was.

359
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:24,672
- Lassiter is still my partner.
- Absolutely.

360
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:27,355
That didn't come out right.

361
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:29,907
You're dismissed.

362
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:44,452
Good news.
We got you a grape one.

363
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,122
Told you I don't want a popsicle.

364
00:18:47,247 --> 00:18:49,440
- Guess we'll have to share this.
- How do you share {\a popsicle}it?

365
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:51,970
I take a lick, you take a lick,
I take a lick, you take a lick,

366
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:53,894
- I take a lick...
- It's yours.

367
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:57,049
Are those overnight bags?

368
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:59,345
- Yeah, had 'em in my trunk.
- You're staying here?

369
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:03,067
My place is a crime scene. It's either
here or I'm mucking with one of you two.

370
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:04,514
{\- Here's fine.}
Make yourself at home.

371
00:19:04,683 --> 00:19:05,629
Excellent.

372
00:19:05,754 --> 00:19:08,919
Now, I have narrowed it down
to 31 known enemies of Chavez.

373
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:10,812
All people who wanted him dead.

374
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:14,316
If we split the list three ways
we can get this done a lot faster.

375
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:17,003
Our objective is to a do
a thorough work-up

376
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:20,512
of every suspect and figure out
who had access to the holding cell.

377
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:23,743
It's{\ none of} not{\ those guys} them.

378
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:25,820
{\Are you saying }That's your method
for all your investigations?

379
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:26,998
- Not all{\ of them}.
- Most{\ of them}.

380
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:29,715
A great many of them, yes.
I am getting something though.

381
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,100
You didn't tell me everything
{\that happened} about that night.

382
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:33,968
I told you everything I saw.

383
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:38,006
When you're deprived of one of your five
senses, the other four compensate

384
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,627
by becoming sharper.

385
00:19:39,752 --> 00:19:40,950
Close your eyes.

386
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:44,388
No can do. I never close my eyes
with other people around, ever.

387
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:46,891
What the hell are you doing?

388
00:19:47,947 --> 00:19:50,153
- The hell are you doing?
- Will you relax?

389
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:59,877
Sensory deprivation.
You tell me what you saw.

390
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,425
Now tell me what you heard.

391
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:05,825
Right, obviously I heard the sound
of my weapon going off.

392
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:07,912
No, that's not it.
Something else.

393
00:20:09,201 --> 00:20:11,069
The only other thing I heard was...

394
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:14,689
- I heard a faint squeak.
- Yahtzee, that's it.

395
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,225
That's our first lead.
We go back to the cell,

396
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,188
figure out
what made that faint little squeak

397
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:21,064
and that'll lead us to our killer.

398
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,291
I have to say,
that's pretty impressive, Spencer.

399
00:20:24,928 --> 00:20:26,700
- Can I take this thing off now?
- You may.

400
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,521
Great, let's get over there.

401
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:30,575
That sounds like
the horchata guy, what?

402
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,269
Guster, we kinda have other things
on our plate right now.

403
00:20:33,438 --> 00:20:36,452
Don't mind him. He's out of his mind.
That's clearly the frozen yogurt guy.

404
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:43,414
Let's do this.

405
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:47,776
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm coming with you.

406
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,038
Buddy, you're under investigation.
You can't go in there.

407
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:54,096
Just stay here.
We'll be back as soon as we can.

408
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:16,749
What are you guys doing here?

409
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:18,877
I was guided here,
by the spirits and Gus.

410
00:21:19,002 --> 00:21:21,811
The spirits told me that you're about
to lead us down to the holding cells.

411
00:21:21,936 --> 00:21:23,686
- Gus just drove.
- Absolutely not.

412
00:21:23,811 --> 00:21:25,823
As you can see,
I am busy with another case.

413
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:27,566
Where's your compassion?

414
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:30,284
This is Lassiter we're talking
about here. He's your comrade.

415
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:32,060
Don't you dare lecture me.

416
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:34,373
I am more upset about this
than you could ever be.

417
00:21:34,498 --> 00:21:37,434
Lassiter is my partner. How would you
feel if something happened to Gus?

418
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,813
Depends {\entirely }on what happened to him.
If he wakes up one day

419
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:42,421
and he's Howard Jones, I'm like,
"dude, things can only get better".

420
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:45,516
He wins U.S. Open, I'm openly weeping
in the front row of the players box

421
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:48,405
between his mom and his dad.
If he leaves the cake out in the rain...

422
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,621
Look...
The chief is on top of this.

423
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:52,965
She's making sure that every piece
of evidence is analyzed,

424
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,460
and every person is questioned.
Even the guy that was passed out

425
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:57,495
- in the holding cell the other night.
- Wait. {\a second...}

426
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,274
- There was someone else down there?
- Somebody named Kenneth Loggins.

427
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:02,059
Kenny Loggins is in jail?

428
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:05,279
The composer of <i>House at Pooh Corner</i>,
and this is it has fallen on hard times?

429
00:22:05,447 --> 00:22:09,057
Not that Kenny Loggins.
This guy is a petty thief and a drunk.

430
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:12,686
We picked him up for vagrancy outside of
{\Tom }Blair's pub and released this morning.

431
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:15,432
Did he see anything that can help us?
Or more importantly...

432
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:19,265
- Did he hear anything?
- No, like I said, he was passed out.

433
00:22:19,645 --> 00:22:21,861
Now I have to go.
Drimmer is waiting for me.

434
00:22:22,714 --> 00:22:24,994
Big, goofy dude from upstairs?
You're working with him now?

435
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,509
It's only temporary.
Just 'till Lassiter gets reinstated.

436
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:31,058
Looks like it's stealth mode
for us, partner.

437
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,862
Stealth mode?
Hit the jackal switch.

438
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:49,414
What is she doing with Drimmer?

439
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:53,234
Oh, my God.

440
00:22:54,104 --> 00:22:56,016
She's already been assigned
a new partner.

441
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,539
- Wait, do you know where we're going?
- I have no idea.

442
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:03,615
And he's letting her drive.

443
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:28,904
Let's just get in and out
before someone catches us.

444
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:30,231
Someone like me?

445
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:33,073
I may yell for the guard,
unless you do what I want.

446
00:23:33,343 --> 00:23:34,409
What do you want?

447
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:38,370
- A friendly ear.
- That's you. I'm not giving him my ear.

448
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:40,216
Talk to him,
but... don't get too close,

449
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:42,416
'cause I'm not {\actually }sure
he doesn't want one of your ears.

450
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:44,526
- You talk to him.
- Will you go and talk to him?

451
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:47,172
- Why do I gotta talk to him?
- Because I gotta walk around here...

452
00:24:32,201 --> 00:24:33,899
I heard a faint squeak.

453
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:47,422
Dude, I got it. Let's go.

454
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:51,186
Did you know that before he stabbed
a guy, he was a life coach?

455
00:24:51,311 --> 00:24:53,812
- Who would hire him as a life coach?
- The guy he stabbed.

456
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:55,681
We need to get out of here.

457
00:24:57,076 --> 00:24:59,716
If what you're saying is right, and
Kenny Loggins saw the murder go down,

458
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:01,952
Why would he lie{\ to the cops},
and say he didn't see anything?

459
00:25:02,077 --> 00:25:05,204
'Cause what he saw, or more importantly,
who he saw, scared the hell out of him.

460
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:08,888
- Loggins knows who the real killer is.
- Which means we're headed to his {\favorite }dive.

461
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:10,076
Tom Blaire's pub?

462
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:12,828
If he wouldn't tell the cops,
why do you think he would tell us?

463
00:25:12,953 --> 00:25:14,303
I have ways, Gus.

464
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:20,302
- You don't have any ways, do you?
- I have curds and wheys.

465
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:48,277
It's Kenny Loggins.

466
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:53,951
He's dead.

467
00:25:54,514 --> 00:25:56,588
So you're saying he's not all right.

468
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:08,103
{\pos(192,220)}What's up? You totally abandoned us.
Where'd you go?

469
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,523
{\pos(192,220)}- Walking.
- Walking? Where?

470
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:13,359
- 'Round.
- And you're not answering your phone.

471
00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:16,529
- Nothing to say.
- Dude, is that my shirt?

472
00:26:19,315 --> 00:26:20,806
I spilled tapioca on mine.

473
00:26:20,994 --> 00:26:22,952
Tapioca?
My tapioca?

474
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,829
{\pos(192,220)}The one with the light dusting of
cinnamon on top, that was in the fridge?

475
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:29,114
- My mom made that.
- Gus, simmer down.

476
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:32,019
- What's going on here?
- Well, let's see...

477
00:26:32,617 --> 00:26:33,962
My partner's moved on,

478
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:36,994
my career's in shambles,
and even sweet lady justice

479
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,469
has abandoned me.

480
00:26:39,353 --> 00:26:41,307
- Bitch.
- Look, you're not done yet.

481
00:26:41,432 --> 00:26:44,473
- There was someone else down there.
- Kenny Loggins, he was passed out.

482
00:26:45,184 --> 00:26:46,616
He wasn't passed out.

483
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:49,241
And I sense that he saw everything,
and someone killed him

484
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:51,773
because of it,
and that someone wasn't you.

485
00:26:51,941 --> 00:26:53,858
- It wasn't you, was it?
- Dude!

486
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:56,193
I'm saying, he's the one
who disappeared from the car.

487
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,929
- This is a huge development.
- It is, you're right.

488
00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:01,305
The one person
who can get me off the hook...

489
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,480
is now dead.

490
00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:06,943
Thank you, Spencer.

491
00:27:10,376 --> 00:27:13,367
He's seriously depressed.
He's going all Bukowski on us.

492
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:16,339
- I don't think we can leave him alone.
- What do we do with him?

493
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:21,009
All right,

494
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,491
I don't think Lassiter killed Chavez
any more than you two do,

495
00:27:23,616 --> 00:27:26,179
but it doesn't mean I want him
camped out in my house.

496
00:27:26,351 --> 00:27:29,240
For the record,
I'm only 75% sure he didn't do it.

497
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:31,866
- Gus...
- What? That's up from yesterday.

498
00:27:31,991 --> 00:27:34,523
Dad, look,
the man's clearly in a bad place.

499
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:37,430
We just need you to keep an eye
on him for a little while.

500
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,158
Yeah, right...
He's in my kitchen,

501
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,447
breaking
my only-I-drink-from-the-carton rule.

502
00:27:41,615 --> 00:27:44,857
He is a fellow cop in need of help.
Isn't that reason enough?

503
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,538
One day, one day.
No more.

504
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:50,705
Thank you.

505
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:53,656
All right, now is this where the...

506
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:56,212
you-ask-for-my-advice part comes in?

507
00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:58,564
What?
No, dad. Please.

508
00:28:02,052 --> 00:28:05,566
All right, check it out. We know that
the real killer had access to the{\ holding} cells,

509
00:28:05,691 --> 00:28:07,524
and knew how to shut off the power.

510
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:09,349
All right.
So the janitor killed him.

511
00:28:12,062 --> 00:28:15,189
- Dad, I think this was an inside job.
- You stop right there.

512
00:28:15,314 --> 00:28:17,626
You do not throw accusations
like that around.

513
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:19,485
- Do you understand?
- Think about it.

514
00:28:19,653 --> 00:28:21,940
Loggins saw the shooter,
but was too afraid to I.D. him.

515
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:25,500
- Now, who would he fear most?
- Kenny Loggins was in the next cell?

516
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,964
- Was Jim Messina in there with him?
- Who's Jim Messina?

517
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:29,994
- A different Kenny Loggins.
- Listen to me...

518
00:28:30,163 --> 00:28:32,750
Under no circumstances do you
go into that police station,

519
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:35,086
and snoop around,
and put yourself at risk.

520
00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:37,169
Do you understand?

521
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:38,921
Look me in the eyes, and say it.

522
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:41,799
I promise.

523
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:43,300
Good.

524
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:48,981
Now hurry up.

525
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:54,038
What, were you raised by wolves?

526
00:28:55,008 --> 00:28:56,146
- Let's go.
- Where{\ we heading}?

527
00:28:56,271 --> 00:28:58,516
- Police station.
- You told your dad you wouldn't go{\ there}.

528
00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:00,491
How long have you known me?

529
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:13,121
- Now, what exactly are we looking for?
- Anything that connects Kenny Loggins

530
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:15,123
to someone in the department.

531
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:20,203
- That's weird.
- What do you got?

532
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:23,268
I'm in the arrest database, and
there's no record of a Kenny Loggins.

533
00:29:23,393 --> 00:29:25,556
The drunkard or the gifted musician.

534
00:29:26,106 --> 00:29:29,638
That doesn't make any sense.
Jules said he was a chronic offender.

535
00:29:29,806 --> 00:29:32,191
These are the hard copies
of every arrest in the last year.

536
00:29:32,316 --> 00:29:34,226
He should definitely be in here.

537
00:29:34,953 --> 00:29:38,647
Dude, this thing goes from page 29,
to page 32. There's two pages missing.

538
00:29:38,815 --> 00:29:40,632
Somebody must've taken it out.

539
00:29:44,386 --> 00:29:46,071
Man, now my fingers are all smudgy.

540
00:29:46,263 --> 00:29:49,282
- Why do I even bother with mani/pedis?
- Dude, I think somebody's here.

541
00:29:51,869 --> 00:29:53,005
Act natural.

542
00:29:55,764 --> 00:29:57,614
What the hell are you doing?

543
00:29:57,844 --> 00:29:59,694
It was the strangest thing, Jules.

544
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:01,670
I'm having psychic spasms.

545
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,106
I believe the origin of these spasms

546
00:30:04,231 --> 00:30:06,591
is coming from inside
the records room.

547
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:08,761
Oh, oh, that's a biggie.

548
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:13,078
I am sensing that there
is something missing in here.

549
00:30:13,203 --> 00:30:15,045
Something to do with Kenny Loggins,

550
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,299
the criminal,
not the man with fabulous hair.

551
00:30:17,424 --> 00:30:19,396
- What are you talking about?
- Another one.

552
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,045
This is from the hips.
This is some serious business.

553
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:26,737
Look at this log book. I'm sensing
all the records of his arrest are gone.

554
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,076
- These pages have been stolen.
- What?

555
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:39,442
What? What is it?
What are you getting?

556
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,192
I was thinking of footloose.

557
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:44,546
The she-welder dances over the chair,
and the water was cascading down.

558
00:30:44,714 --> 00:30:46,632
- That wasflashdance.
- That was awesome.

559
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,329
- Oh, my god!
- What?

560
00:30:48,454 --> 00:30:50,969
I saw Ocampo go in this office earlier.
He was shredding papers.

561
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:53,013
- The IA guy?
- It makes perfect sense.

562
00:30:53,181 --> 00:30:55,925
He has big-time political ambitions,
and taking down a high-ranking officer

563
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,206
would be a huge career boost
for him.

564
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:00,437
The shredder's been emptied.
The janitor is still here.

565
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:02,194
Come on, let's go.

566
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:11,667
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
That's dirty.

567
00:31:17,178 --> 00:31:19,026
It's impossible
to tell anything from these.

568
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:21,875
- Not after they're taped back up again.
- Tell me you're kidding.

569
00:31:22,043 --> 00:31:24,670
I don't joke about meticulously
reassembling shredded documents.

570
00:31:24,838 --> 00:31:26,046
This will be fun.

571
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,492
Like doing a puzzle.

572
00:31:27,617 --> 00:31:31,218
Except instead of revealing a shipwreck,
we'll get proof Ocampo is the killer.

573
00:31:31,386 --> 00:31:34,176
I'll stay here and trace any logon
ocampo made to the database...

574
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:35,658
Someone's coming.

575
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:39,300
O'hara, I finished up
that paperwork for both of us,

576
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:41,477
so I'm gonna take off for the day.

577
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:43,319
See you around, partner.

578
00:31:46,891 --> 00:31:48,443
- Partner.
- That's cold, juliet.

579
00:31:48,612 --> 00:31:51,780
He is not my partner,
he just thinks that he is my partner.

580
00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:54,241
He's paid for coffee,
brought me cupcakes,

581
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:57,645
but trust me, my mind is 100% focused
on Lassiter, just like you.

582
00:32:00,826 --> 00:32:03,800
You guys are thinking
about cupcakes, aren't you?

583
00:32:09,526 --> 00:32:11,229
They're not on her desk.

584
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:21,899
Are you gonna help out or what?

585
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:25,063
Gus, i'm still cramping, man.
It's my fault, I should've hydrated.

586
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,482
I cannot take it anymore. I cannot spend
one more minute with Lassiter.

587
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:31,459
He is... driving me outta my mind.

588
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:37,700
- What is this?
- Nothing.

589
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:38,908
Just...

590
00:32:39,075 --> 00:32:40,745
- You know...
- Paper.

591
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:43,248
You went to the police station?
I told you very specifically

592
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:45,420
do not go there
and poke your nose around.

593
00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:47,612
My nose is not to blame.
My feet took me there.

594
00:32:47,737 --> 00:32:50,255
Along with Gus,
but listen, we struck gold.

595
00:32:50,423 --> 00:32:53,300
In these shreddings is the answer
to who killed Kenny Loggins.

596
00:32:53,468 --> 00:32:56,178
We could use an extra set of hands.
My knuckles are swelling.

597
00:32:56,346 --> 00:32:58,423
You said it was cramping.

598
00:32:58,548 --> 00:33:01,182
- The pain is criminal, Gus.
- What do you say, dad?

599
00:33:01,962 --> 00:33:04,073
Help us out, or back to Lassie?

600
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:10,868
That bad, huh?

601
00:33:10,993 --> 00:33:13,792
Can't take it anymore.
He's eaten everything in my house,

602
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,323
he's recording
every episode of cops.

603
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:18,290
- You love cops.
- Not 25 times a day.

604
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:21,213
It's got me nostalgic for the times
that you were living at home.

605
00:33:21,338 --> 00:33:23,525
- It's nauseating.
- Thanks, dad.

606
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:26,958
Peanut guy.
You two keep at it.

607
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,487
And I'll be back before you can say,
I heart legumes.

608
00:33:39,377 --> 00:33:41,222
- You're really good.
- It's hereditary.

609
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,767
I come from a long line
of puzzlers, Gus.

610
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:47,245
- Shawn is terrible at puzzles.
- Skips a generation.

611
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:50,353
And there's a little
something extra for you.

612
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:58,750
Out for my nightly jog.

613
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,607
- Gotta work off those cupcakes.
- Right.

614
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:03,953
Good luck with that.

615
00:34:04,121 --> 00:34:06,722
Hey, listen,
I was wondering something.

616
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:10,125
Are you and O'hara...
You know, an item?

617
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:13,171
'cause she seems to talk
about you an awful lot.

618
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,798
Really?

619
00:34:15,565 --> 00:34:16,966
What is he doing out there?

620
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:19,260
He's got the nuts already.
Bring 'em in.

621
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:23,556
Does this say versa bank?

622
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:28,100
- This is a credit card bill.
- Yep. So much for Shawn's theory.

623
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:30,440
Is that all he's paying for cable?

624
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:31,944
I'm getting robbed!

625
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:34,400
That's fascinating. What else?
What else did she say?

626
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:36,778
Well, that you're very witty
and urbane.

627
00:34:36,946 --> 00:34:37,856
I'm sure.

628
00:34:37,981 --> 00:34:39,906
And also, that you're really gifted.

629
00:34:40,154 --> 00:34:43,010
This psychic stuff really...
brings results.

630
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:45,620
So, first thing I gotta know is...

631
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,250
Am I gonna win the lottery?

632
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:49,832
- I'm not.
- I don't know.

633
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,730
I didn't think I was anyway, so...

634
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,911
No, but more importantly,

635
00:34:57,675 --> 00:35:00,575
you getting anything
on this Lassiter business?

636
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:05,723
<i>Man. Now my fingers are all smudgy.</i>

637
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,116
You're getting something,
aren't you?

638
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:13,856
All I got is a couple of dudes in
the office jonesing for peanuts.

639
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:17,652
One of 'em's part elephant.
He never lets me forget that.

640
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,696
I guess you better get back to them.

641
00:35:19,864 --> 00:35:21,197
Good talk, Drimmer.

642
00:35:22,318 --> 00:35:24,184
Hey, Shawn. One more thing.

643
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,570
That was a cheap shot, Drimmer.

644
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:35,086
One minute we're there chatting
about your creepy infatuation

645
00:35:35,254 --> 00:35:36,200
with Jules,

646
00:35:36,325 --> 00:35:39,525
{\pos(192,230)}and the next, I'm laying
on this uncomfortable couch.

647
00:35:40,383 --> 00:35:43,940
{\pos(192,230)}In Lassie's place, no less?
My god. Could this get any worse?

648
00:35:46,203 --> 00:35:47,521
I guess it can.

649
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:49,597
Shut up, Spencer.

650
00:35:49,935 --> 00:35:52,543
You might be able to smartass
your way outta some things,

651
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:54,355
{\pos(192,230)}but I don't see that happening here.

652
00:35:54,523 --> 00:35:57,024
{\pos(192,230)}- So you're the psychic now.
- Shut up.

653
00:35:57,192 --> 00:36:00,486
{\pos(192,230)}I like the sound of my own voice.
I won't apologize for that.

654
00:36:00,654 --> 00:36:02,728
{\pos(192,230)}Besides, I should thank you
for cold-cocking me.

655
00:36:02,853 --> 00:36:05,649
You managed to shake
my psychic juju loose.

656
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:08,911
One second.

657
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:16,036
It was you Chavez looked at
when Lassiter brought him in.

658
00:36:16,161 --> 00:36:20,072
Because in your years on the gang unit,
the two of you became quite the bffs.

659
00:36:20,527 --> 00:36:22,696
You never brought Chavez in,
and you never intended to,

660
00:36:22,821 --> 00:36:24,385
because you were on his payroll.

661
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:27,434
<i>You guys in the gang unit
couldn't catch Chavez,</i>

662
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,780
<i>but Lassiter did.</i>

663
00:36:28,905 --> 00:36:30,201
<i>Yeah, whatever.</i>

664
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,616
<i>Made our job easier.</i>

665
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,311
<i>Kudos, Lassiter.</i>

666
00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:37,732
He was turning state's witness,
you knew it was only a matter of time

667
00:36:38,052 --> 00:36:40,376
before he pointed the finger at you.

668
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:41,986
So you had to take him out.

669
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:54,916
Poor Kenny Loggins,
he was just collateral damage.

670
00:36:55,084 --> 00:36:56,692
One might even say...

671
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:59,086
He was in the danger zone.

672
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:02,086
Come on, Drimmer.

673
00:37:02,211 --> 00:37:04,050
That at least merited
a micro-chuckle.

674
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,763
You really think killing me
is gonna solve your problems?

675
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,821
Oh, I'm not gonna kill ya.

676
00:37:23,498 --> 00:37:26,113
{\Break in the case,
meet me at your apartment.}

677
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,662
- Have you seen shawn?
- He's missing.

678
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,453
No, he isn't exactly missing.
He hasn't been gone 24 hours.

679
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,819
- Gus is a little panicky.
- Where did you last see him?

680
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,362
He was last outside our office,
talking with your new partner.

681
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:42,922
What's his name?
Cupcake guy?

682
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,071
That's weird.

683
00:37:44,196 --> 00:37:47,776
He told me he was driving to Santa Paula
to visit his mother.

684
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:55,189
Spencer, get your feet off my table.
How the hell'd you get in my place?

685
00:38:01,188 --> 00:38:03,943
I can't believe you thought
that text was actually from me.

686
00:38:04,745 --> 00:38:06,779
It lacked all nuance,
my signature mocking tone,

687
00:38:06,947 --> 00:38:08,864
and was utterly devoid of emoticons.

688
00:38:10,763 --> 00:38:11,769
Why?

689
00:38:11,894 --> 00:38:14,146
Because he's in business
with Cinco Reyes,

690
00:38:14,271 --> 00:38:17,870
and when you brought in Chavez,
business hours were over, sweetheart.

691
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:19,817
I just became kojak.

692
00:38:19,942 --> 00:38:23,700
I knew it was something off about you,
but I didn't figure you for dirty.

693
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,007
You are one lowlife,
scum-suckin' bastard, aren't you?

694
00:38:28,132 --> 00:38:30,010
I know how this works, Lassiter.

695
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:32,972
Trying to throw me off
with one of your stupid little insults.

696
00:38:34,975 --> 00:38:37,768
Well, fellas,
might as well get on with it.

697
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:39,019
What's that?

698
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:42,398
Your suicide note.

699
00:38:43,562 --> 00:38:45,067
It explains how Spencer

700
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:47,181
psychically figured out
that it was you.

701
00:38:47,306 --> 00:38:49,697
I believe the term you're
looking for is "divined."

702
00:38:53,813 --> 00:38:55,744
Spencer "divined"

703
00:38:56,053 --> 00:38:57,955
it was you
who killed Chavez and Loggins,

704
00:38:58,124 --> 00:39:00,124
and he was gonna
go to the chief with it.

705
00:39:00,636 --> 00:39:02,063
So you shot him.

706
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:06,088
You two being former lovers and all,
you were overwhelmed with guilt.

707
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,530
- Former lovers? Really?
- Called misinformation.

708
00:39:08,717 --> 00:39:11,201
He's hoping they won't
look too closely.

709
00:39:12,158 --> 00:39:14,054
You are one sick twist, Drimmer.

710
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:15,885
I know.

711
00:39:17,674 --> 00:39:19,309
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just wait.

712
00:39:19,477 --> 00:39:21,729
I'm getting something.
Something wild.

713
00:39:22,432 --> 00:39:25,024
Something in the way you look tonight.
Deep blue.

714
00:39:25,474 --> 00:39:28,861
- Something...
- Do you ever stop talking?

715
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,844
What're you doing there?
Looking for one of your spare pistols

716
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:35,409
that you've hidden?
Cops found all your guns.

717
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:39,538
Hey, stop it!
What're you doing?

718
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,623
Stop that! Back off.

719
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:42,791
Stop that!

720
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:54,065
Looks like they missed one.

721
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,560
At least one.
There are eight.

722
00:39:56,841 --> 00:40:00,619
And I seriously doubt they found the one
in my shower or hidden in my hi-fi.

723
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,564
How'd you find us?

724
00:40:04,689 --> 00:40:06,948
I tracked Drimmer
on his cell phone GPS.

725
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:08,806
Shawn. Are you all right?

726
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:10,722
Yeah, I think so.

727
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:14,372
Hi-fi?
Lassie, you were so cool a second ago.

728
00:40:21,414 --> 00:40:23,055
All right.
We get our check, boom.

729
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,608
Right to the cable company.
And no chatting up juliet.

730
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:27,495
- Juliet who?
- What's lassiter doing here?

731
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,675
{\pos(192,230)}- I thought he was taking some time off.
- You know he wants to see us.

732
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:35,135
How's our favorite {\pos(192,230)}exonerated murderer
slash dirty cop catcher doing?

733
00:40:35,303 --> 00:40:37,650
- We thought you were on vacation.
- I am.

734
00:40:37,775 --> 00:40:39,233
This is my vacation.

735
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,975
Man, it is so good to have you back.

736
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,737
Listen, guys.

737
00:40:45,331 --> 00:40:48,815
What you did for me...
I can't tell you how much it means.

738
00:40:49,388 --> 00:40:51,610
I mean, granted,
I did save your life,

739
00:40:51,778 --> 00:40:53,946
but I know I wouldn't be back
if it weren't for you two.

740
00:40:54,114 --> 00:40:56,406
We know you woulda done
the same for us.

741
00:40:57,014 --> 00:40:58,075
Let's not go crazy.

742
00:40:58,997 --> 00:41:02,120
But look, I...
I do have something for you.

743
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:03,837
More of a token, really.

744
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,416
Get out of this station.

745
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,256
Free chips with any sandwich purchase
at Hal's hoagies.

746
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,968
- Lassie, there aren't words.
- It's the least I could do.

747
00:41:17,136 --> 00:41:18,762
Yes, it is.

748
00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:24,309
I do have something else for you.

749
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:27,229
Got the chief to sign your check.

750
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:28,533
Sweet!

751
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:31,937
Catch you later.

752
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:35,070
- Off to the cable company.
- What?

753
00:41:40,494 --> 00:41:42,792
No chatting up.
You promise, Shawn!
