1
00:00:03,512 --> 00:00:05,878
Who put the orange slices
in the punch bowl already?

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,183
They'll be soggy by the time
everyone gets here.

3
00:00:08,184 --> 00:00:09,825
This is a disaster, people!

4
00:00:09,826 --> 00:00:13,116
Yep... first, typhoid fever.
Now this?

5
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:15,942
Shawn, this night has been
13 years in the making.

6
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:17,564
Everything has to go perfectly.

7
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:20,597
What I need from you is your
support and your cooperation.

8
00:00:20,598 --> 00:00:22,898
- Not your sarcasm and mockery.
- Okay, buddy.

9
00:00:23,143 --> 00:00:25,763
Let me know when I can mock,
'cause I'm ready to mock.

10
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,159
Where's your grad pic?

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,896
Oh, yeah, i'm not gonna wear mine.

12
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:31,415
Shawn, come on. Don't do this to me.
You know that was my thing.

13
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,495
Instead of name tags,
we'll know who everyone is

14
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:35,698
from their class picture.
Great idea, right?

15
00:00:36,378 --> 00:00:37,937
Is it mock time yet?

16
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:39,422
Just put it on, shawn.

17
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:40,822
Okay, fine.

18
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:41,988
Excuse me.

19
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:44,214
There. You happy now?

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,520
- Shawn, that isn't you, is it?
- No, it isn't.

21
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,753
- It's judd nelson, isn't it?
- Yes, it is,

22
00:00:48,812 --> 00:00:50,919
and it's sweet, sweet, nice.

23
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:53,433
Look who just rolled in.

24
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:55,648
Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy.

25
00:00:58,293 --> 00:01:00,095
From Fresh Horses.

26
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,283
That's Howie Tolkin.

27
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:03,106
He was our quarterback
junior and senior year.

28
00:01:03,107 --> 00:01:04,264
We had a football team?

29
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:05,653
- Yes.
- Tackle?

30
00:01:05,654 --> 00:01:07,642
- Seriously?
- Who's the prom queen?

31
00:01:07,643 --> 00:01:09,670
She's the prom queen.
Eileen mazwell.

32
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:11,179
You really don't remember
any of this?

33
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,531
They're married now.

34
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:17,485
Dude, you didn't tell me
abigail lytar was coming.

35
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:18,772
Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:23,594
I should... Should say hello.

37
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:29,254
Abigail lytar.

38
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,699
Judd nelson.

39
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,899
In the flesh.

40
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:37,163
I loved you infrom the hip.

41
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,472
Thank you very much.

42
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,613
You know, there are those
who believe

43
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:42,592
I flared my nostrils
too much in that film.

44
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:45,030
Oh, no. I mean, how else could
we have possibly known how

45
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:47,093
angst-ridden you were?

46
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:48,752
I agree.

47
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:50,873
So...

48
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:53,910
Yeah, so...

49
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:58,664
- Hello, abigail.
- Hi. I need you to go to the cafeteria

50
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:00,601
and grab another stack
of folding chairs for me.

51
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:02,636
- We're already short.
- Consider it done.

52
00:02:02,637 --> 00:02:04,248
One problem: where's the cafeteria?

53
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,940
Did you even attend this school?
Just grab the chairs.

54
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:08,508
I don't know where i'm going.

55
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,378
Maybe abigail could help you.

56
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:11,813
I like that.

57
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:13,797
I like that very much.

58
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:22,006
You really don't remember
what happened between us

59
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:25,656
in high school, do you?
Stern's wharf senior year.

60
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:27,528
The carnival on the pier.

61
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:29,520
You pursued me, like,
every day of senior year.

62
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:31,893
And then I finally agreed
to go out with you,

63
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:34,588
and then you didn't show up.

64
00:02:35,263 --> 00:02:38,535
I... yeah. Yes.

65
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:41,244
Here's the thing, abigail.
And not a lot of people know this.

66
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:44,403
I was actually working as a midwife
back then. Family business.

67
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:47,683
And I got a call from a client
ate at night going into labor.

68
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,645
34 hours.

69
00:02:49,646 --> 00:02:53,464
That's a lot of screaming, fair amount
of pushing, some dilation, tongs.

70
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,500
I can see where it wouldn't
have occurred to you to call me.

71
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,082
But you know what?
It was 13 years ago.

72
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,856
- Hardly matters now.
- Exactly is what I'm saying.

73
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:02,258
It's like forever ago. We're adults now,
doing adult things.

74
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:04,517
And you're a teacher.
That's fantastic.

75
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,525
What about you? Or are
you still in midwifery?

76
00:03:07,526 --> 00:03:09,226
No, no.

77
00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:11,641
I've dabbled in quite
a few things, actually.

78
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:14,953
But I landed quite nicely
on psychic detective.

79
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:19,020
That's for real.

80
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:23,120
Who would actually choose
to be a psychic?

81
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,904
First of all, it's a gift.
It's not a choice.

82
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,164
And I happen to be
very, very good at it.

83
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:32,804
I solve crimes for the santa barbara
police department.

84
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:34,497
It's kind of a big deal.

85
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:36,297
You solve crimes?

86
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:37,774
All the time.

87
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:41,017
Okay, well, you be sure
to let me know

88
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:43,261
if you sense that, you know,
someone here at the reunion

89
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:46,070
is gonna steal my lunch money.

90
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,301
That's very clever.

91
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:55,113
Did you see that?

92
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:57,900
What, is someone getting
their lunch money stolen?

93
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:01,543
I think it's a little bit
bigger than that.

94
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,681
Psych 302
"Murder?…Anyone?…Anyone?…Bueller?"

95
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,997
Synchro : Flolo

96
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:22,031
For SeriesSub.com

97
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:26,085
Someone was murdered here.

98
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:30,937
I am absolutely 100% certain
that I sensed a body drop here.

99
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,390
Right here.

100
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:34,690
I don't know who.

101
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,034
But I can see he was wearing a...
Letterman's jacket of some sort.

102
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:39,881
Are you doing this to me
on purpose?

103
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:41,753
Are you fabricating some kind
of foul play

104
00:04:41,754 --> 00:04:43,819
- just to mess up the night for me?
- Yes, I am.

105
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,697
I killed someone here
at our high school reunion

106
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:48,161
just to foil your
13-year video retrospective

107
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,499
of best pep rally moments.

108
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,721
Do you even know
what a pep captain is?

109
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:54,481
Yeah, he's a male cheerleader
I believe.

110
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:56,681
It's a leader among men.

111
00:04:56,682 --> 00:04:58,536
A leader among men.

112
00:04:58,537 --> 00:05:00,057
Who cheers.

113
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:01,652
I sawbring it on.

114
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:05,290
Oh, wait, I get it.
You guys are dating. You're together.

115
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,668
- Everything makes sense.
- We are not dating.

116
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:10,086
Are you kidding me?
He was voted most likely to succeed.

117
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:11,621
Think he's gonna date me?

118
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:14,678
- No body, no crime, shawn.
- Gus, buddy...

119
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,660
No body, no crime.

120
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:19,083
No body, no crime.

121
00:05:19,213 --> 00:05:22,137
- He's just gonna keep saying that, isn't he?
- I believe so. Yes.

122
00:05:22,497 --> 00:05:24,082
But...

123
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:27,162
- You don't believe me either?
- No body, no crime, shawn.

124
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:29,268
But... Abigail.

125
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:44,939
- Hello?
- Hey, hi.

126
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:49,226
Yes, yes, it's me, henry,
your ex-husband.

127
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:51,823
Look, I don't want
to bother you. But...

128
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:55,425
- How you doing?
- Great. And you?

129
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:57,441
Great. Doing great.

130
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:02,768
- Well, there's that.
- Hey, mad, listen.

131
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:06,576
I'm just about to cook up
a steak here,

132
00:06:06,577 --> 00:06:08,865
and I've got another one
sitting right next to it.

133
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:11,578
I was just thinking, you know,
if you're hungry, you could,

134
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,917
would you...

135
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,434
Or not, I...

136
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:20,412
Honestly, I would love
to taste one of your steaks.

137
00:06:20,823 --> 00:06:23,898
But I just had a delicious
salad from room service.

138
00:06:24,362 --> 00:06:27,640
Hey, no biggie.
I, you know... Of course.

139
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:29,467
I just was concerned
that you hadn't eaten

140
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:32,840
and now that I know that you
had salad, I feel better and...

141
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,363
Have a good night.

142
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,643
You too.

143
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:50,514
Okay, dude, I think I'm
on to something.

144
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:52,750
Now, true, there may not be
an actual body.

145
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:54,872
But I am telling you
that a very real crime

146
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,892
was committed here and there
is very real evidence.

147
00:06:56,893 --> 00:06:59,746
I would like to see some evidence
of some folding chairs, shawn.

148
00:06:59,747 --> 00:07:01,322
If you're not gonna take this seriously,

149
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:04,058
then I will pull out this phone,
and I will call lassiter.

150
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:07,915
Hey, Could you start distributing
these ballots for the reunion king

151
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,274
- and queen to everybody?
- Dialing.

152
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:12,002
Connecting.

153
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,876
Ringing.

154
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:27,799
Lassiter, what are you doing
at our reunion?

155
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:31,036
Well, first off,
of course it had to be yours,

156
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:35,321
'cause that's my luck. And
secondly, i'm on a date.

157
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,650
Well, we're on a case,
and you're on it with us.

158
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:40,082
- Not tonight I'm not.
- On a date?

159
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,154
- With a person?
- Yes, with a person.

160
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:45,436
Blonde, yellow dress.

161
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:48,511
Mindy howland?

162
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:51,296
Isn't that the girl
who stuffed bobby cobetts

163
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:53,487
in his own car trunk when he wouldn't
kiss her at the spring fling?

164
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,967
We met at the santa barbara bowl
at the ravi shankar concert

165
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:58,923
last week, and she asked me out
on a date.

166
00:07:58,924 --> 00:08:01,677
Who goes to someone else's reunion
when they barely even know them?

167
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,231
Who goes to a ravi shankar concert?

168
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,354
Look, I didn't realize
it was a reunion until I showed up.

169
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:07,977
But we have a very deep connection.

170
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:10,149
Same connection you have
with the sitar.

171
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:12,264
Where's my punch, corey?

172
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:14,396
Yeah, where's her punch, corey?

173
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:17,115
Hello, mindy. You look... Nice.

174
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:19,735
Give it up, button-up. I already
have a date to this thing.

175
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:23,118
Mindy, it's official.
You've won bitchiest bana.

176
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:26,161
And now I am going
to borrow detective lassiter

177
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:28,154
for as long as I'd like.

178
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:33,073
- Detec... Wait, he's a cop?
- All right, I have to be discreet.

179
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:35,379
Gus has a very weak constitution
for these sort of things.

180
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,237
I witnessed a murder here tonight.

181
00:08:37,238 --> 00:08:39,091
- What? Who?
- I'm not entirely sure.

182
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:41,921
- What did you see?
- I didn't actually see anything.

183
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,723
I psychically witnessed it
with my third eye.

184
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,868
- Where's the body?
- There's not one.

185
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:49,615
Listen up. Let me impart to you
a little police wisdom

186
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:52,784
we like to throw around down at
the station. No body, no crime.

187
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:56,038
- What, do you guys put that on a t-shirt?
- Fine. Who did it and why?

188
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,331
I don't know, but... I don't know.

189
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:01,102
- Do you have a murder weapon?
- no.

190
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:03,255
Well, then good night, spencer.

191
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:10,758
This so-called football team
of ours, were we any good?

192
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:13,513
Yes, we won state champ
our senior year.

193
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:15,423
Seriously, you didn't go
to any of the games?

194
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:18,113
The games were on fridays.
That would mean missing step by step.

195
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:21,806
But this winning state, would that get
you some sort of special pin?

196
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:24,729
Yes, shawn. The state champs pin.

197
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:35,958
I got it.

198
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,118
- Lassie, I know who the murder victim is.
- Who?

199
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:42,013
Class of '95,
sabercats' starting quarterback

200
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:47,905
howie tolkin!

201
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:49,739
What?

202
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:58,122
Howie.

203
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:03,855
Hold that thought.

204
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:08,674
Look, jules, just get down here
as fast as you can.

205
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:12,077
I really need your help
on this case. It's intense.

206
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:15,291
I will fill you in
on the rest when you get here.

207
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:17,254
Thank you.

208
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:26,273
So carl, this is my ex-boyfriend
from high school all four years, eldon.

209
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:28,608
- Nice to meet you, buddy.
- Yeah.

210
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:35,371
Right. And this is his, his brand-new wife,
stephanie.

211
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:40,900
Yeah. So, I'm dating a cop now.

212
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:43,081
Oh, really?

213
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:46,385
- Yeah.
- You ever, shoot anybody?

214
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:48,397
- Well, I don't...
- Of course he has.

215
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,057
- Probably a bunch of people.
- A bunch?

216
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:55,436
I mean, you know,
what is a bunch really? Yes.

217
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:58,773
Women. Absolutely nothing
but heartache, man.

218
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:01,000
All they want is a ring, man.

219
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:03,095
They won't stop
till they get the ring.

220
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,738
Dude, I could not have said it
better myself.

221
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:09,384
Maybe clearer, but I agree.
I'm just like you guys.

222
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:12,200
I... I hope to kiss one... Someday.

223
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:15,480
Exactly. You know, dude,
you're just like us.

224
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:17,801
Marginally employed,
single, never been married.

225
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,691
I mean, you get it.

226
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:27,639
Did you guys see someone
tampering with this case?

227
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,204
No, but I wish I'd thought of that.

228
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:31,084
I would love to see
that tolkin guy go down.

229
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:32,660
He terrorized me in high school.

230
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:35,398
They build a shrine for him
'cause he can throw a football?

231
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,185
- Who cares?
- Exactly.

232
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:40,213
Hey, why don't they build
a shrine to my butt?

233
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:45,192
There you are! I've been
looking all over for you.

234
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:48,491
Dude, you totally lied to us.
You have a girl, and she is hot.

235
00:11:48,492 --> 00:11:50,406
Excuse us, dudes.

236
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,326
- Okay, what are you wearing?
- What?

237
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:54,888
You said you were on a case
and there were possible

238
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:56,640
criminal suspects down here
that might get spooked

239
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:58,979
- by cops sniffing around.
- Yeah, but what are you wearing?

240
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,133
This is a reunion, not the prom.
I need you to fit in.

241
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:03,358
What, this? This isn't a prom dress.

242
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,640
It looks like a prom dress.
It's a little... Poofy.

243
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,010
- It doesn't poof. There's no poof.
- A slight poof.

244
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:09,178
Look, it's what I was gonna wear

245
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:11,595
to my high school reunion that I couldn't
go to because I was on a case.

246
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:14,286
Just show me where these suspects
are that I need to vet.

247
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:16,856
I don't know if you need
to "vet" anything. The animals are fine.

248
00:12:16,857 --> 00:12:19,083
But let's poof on over,
and I'll point 'em out to you.

249
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:21,912
Oh, thanks for playing up
that whole tough guy

250
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:24,667
cop thing, you know, with eldon.
That was really nice of you.

251
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:26,466
I think the "i'm packing heat" thing

252
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:28,661
was a little overboard,
but he seemed to buy it, so...

253
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:30,613
But I am packing heat.

254
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,203
That's cute. What, do
you squeeze the trigger

255
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:36,513
and a little pen comes out so you
can write people parking tickets?

256
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:39,550
Barnaby jones, why don't you
hold my purse while I go dance.

257
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,992
I called you
because I need your help.

258
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:45,491
Oh, my god! It's howie and eileen!

259
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:49,871
Abe froman, sausage king of chicago.

260
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:53,120
Yes! We all spent our wonder years
together.

261
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:55,329
- Right.
- You guys look great.

262
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,075
Especially you. I want you battin'
clean-up, if you catch my meaning.

263
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:01,094
Look at that package?

264
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:05,114
I don't mean to be a downer, guys,
but did you know that somebody tampered

265
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:06,884
with your football shrine?

266
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,894
Dude, seriously,
that's just old high school stuff.

267
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:12,893
I don't even think about that anymore.
I'm actually on to much bigger stuff now, so.

268
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:16,152
Howie just announced his candidacy
for state assembly last month.

269
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:20,205
Yeah, dude. I care about the issues I
actually think I can make a difference.

270
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:22,691
- Isn't that right, babe?
- That's right, baby.

271
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:24,604
See, after I fix
the state of california,

272
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:27,318
i'm gonna write a motivational book
for losers who need help.

273
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:30,512
And the working title right now
is move it... Or move it!

274
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:34,137
That is so much stuff.

275
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:36,326
When will you find time
to tape larry lester's

276
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:37,987
butt cheeks together?

277
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:41,941
Never sawbreakfast club?
Either of you?

278
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:44,117
Okay, baby.

279
00:13:44,118 --> 00:13:46,639
Howie wants one of those
little mini quesadillas.

280
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:48,221
Let's get after it.

281
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:51,375
Who hasn't seen the breakfast club?

282
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:54,768
You honestly don't think there's
anything suspicious about those two?

283
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:59,273
I'm not sure. I mean, for a guy
who's clearly stuck in the past,

284
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:01,737
he seemed to brush off
the whole vandalism

285
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:03,703
of his trophy case thing pretty easily.

286
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:06,354
I could dust the case for prints,
but that's it.

287
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:09,207
Anyone who enters or
exits this place is a suspect.

288
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,517
This thing ends
before I solve the homicide,

289
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:14,160
you can kiss the murderer
good-bye. Gus, thank goodness.

290
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:16,689
I need to get to the roof.
I need to get into the library.

291
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,917
I need to psychically remember
everything about high school.

292
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:21,774
That stuff is locked up tight.
This place is like fort knox tonight.

293
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:23,698
Fine.

294
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:26,952
- Where's the gymnasium?
- We're in the gymnasium.

295
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:32,905
Buddy, you did a really nice job.

296
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:38,938
Hey, shawn, what's up?

297
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:41,338
Listen, dad, remember that box

298
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,843
of my old high school stuff
that mom put away for me?

299
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,580
It was just...
It was a box of stuff.

300
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:48,097
- What box?
- The box.

301
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:49,969
What box, shawn?

302
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,148
What am I thinking? Mom's in town.
Do me a favor.

303
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:53,998
Call her, find out where she put it.

304
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:56,565
- I can't. I can't.
- What do you mean you can't?

305
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:59,259
I can't. I just talked to her, shawn,
and I think she thought...

306
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,844
I mean, supposedly she had a salad.

307
00:15:01,845 --> 00:15:03,739
Who am I to think
that she didn't have a salad?

308
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,084
Dad, I need this box.

309
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,061
I'm on a case, okay?
Just call her, locate the box.

310
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:11,398
- I will come get it from you.
- Fine.

311
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,675
Fine.

312
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:15,334
What is he talk... I don't...

313
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:20,734
- I just don't see it.
- You're not looking.

314
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:23,515
There's so much stuff.
What is all this crap?

315
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:26,499
- It's your life.
- These boxes are not my life.

316
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,055
Well, it's stuff
from your life anyway.

317
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:30,628
I boxed it all up 'cause I thought

318
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,637
maybe someday you'd want
to look at it again...

319
00:15:32,638 --> 00:15:35,583
- When you're old and crotchety.
- Yeah, well, I just want to dump it all.

320
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:38,330
Which in your case would be today.

321
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:41,998
Look it... Look it this.
Look at that.

322
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:43,944
- What is it?
- It's a matchbox car.

323
00:15:43,945 --> 00:15:46,541
It's shawn's first one. I bought it for him.
I brought it home, remember?

324
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:49,265
- I do.
- He never even played with it.

325
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:53,747
- You bought him a squad car.
- But kids love police cars.

326
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:55,755
But they're all police cars.

327
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,892
- All 20 of them.
- No, no, no. They're all different.

328
00:15:57,893 --> 00:16:00,584
You see that one there?
That's a squad car.

329
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,591
This one here... See that?

330
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,836
That's a paddy wagon.

331
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:08,616
A prison transport vehicle.
That's an old one.

332
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:10,513
Look at that.

333
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:12,592
Crowd control van.

334
00:16:12,593 --> 00:16:15,361
Look, it even has little tiny
water cannons up on top.

335
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,730
Here's the box he wanted.

336
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:22,936
You know, I thought you would've become,

337
00:16:22,993 --> 00:16:25,758
like, a doctor or something
like that.

338
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:29,208
Well, what I do
is pretty fascinating.

339
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,589
Really? How so?

340
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:35,517
Well, with my specialty,
which is mucus reducers,

341
00:16:35,518 --> 00:16:37,468
I use a mixture of...

342
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,516
Did I also tell you that I have
a side psychic detective business

343
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:44,227
that I started with my buddy?

344
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:46,462
- Really?
- Yeah.

345
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,752
And I may or may not have
tracked down a counterfeiter,

346
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:53,107
unveiled a nanny ring,
saved the show american duos,

347
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:55,465
- stuff like that.
- That was you?

348
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,456
I remember that.

349
00:16:57,457 --> 00:17:00,053
I'm kind of working
on a case right now.

350
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:03,486
Really? God, that's hot.

351
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:16,662
- What are you guys doing here?
- Oh, we slid in.

352
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:18,267
We brought you the box
you were bitching about.

353
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:20,338
No, no, no, dad.
I asked you to locate the box

354
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:22,107
so that I could come
pick it up from you.

355
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,526
Not to drag mom down
to my high school reunion.

356
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,753
Lighten up, honey.
What are you so worried about?

357
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,530
It's not like
i'm gonna pull out a kleenex,

358
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:31,157
wet it, and then wipe
the corners of your mouth.

359
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:34,826
Look, it's gus.
I have to say hello.

360
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:37,423
No, mom, there aren't really
any other parents here.

361
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:38,954
Awesome.

362
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:40,632
What exactly are you up to?

363
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:42,769
All right, look, shawn,
I went to this school too.

364
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,432
So it was my school
long before it was yours.

365
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:46,175
Okay, fine.
You win "oldest student here" award.

366
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:47,996
Now will you please leave?
I'm sure the nondescript

367
00:17:47,997 --> 00:17:50,143
blazer rental place is about to close.

368
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:52,455
Hey hey, cutie patootie!

369
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:55,092
Look, seriously,
my name is carlton, okay?

370
00:17:55,093 --> 00:17:57,500
How hard is that to remember?
Carl-ton.

371
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,332
Yeah, I know your name, silly.

372
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,833
I just think a better name
for you is cutie patootie.

373
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:04,866
You know, because you have
such a cutie patootie.

374
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:06,324
Hey, there!

375
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:08,461
Exactly how much
of that punch have you had?

376
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,163
Just enough to realize, you know,

377
00:18:10,164 --> 00:18:15,076
that I might've been a little short
with you before and I'm very sorry.

378
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:16,940
Can you forgive me?

379
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:19,641
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

380
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:21,800
Yeah? Good, 'cause I...

381
00:18:21,913 --> 00:18:26,610
I have just one teensy weensy little
tiny favor to ask of you.

382
00:18:26,863 --> 00:18:28,421
What's that?

383
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:31,537
I need you to make a move
on eldon's wife, stephanie,

384
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:34,802
'cause I want that painted whore
out of the picture, okay?

385
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:39,159
- Can you do that for me?
- No, I cannot do that for you.

386
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:41,121
Fine.

387
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:43,407
You suck!

388
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:44,945
What?

389
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:46,904
Your purse!

390
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:48,833
Crap.

391
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:51,091
Oh, great.

392
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:56,449
Well, that figures.

393
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:06,265
What are those?

394
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:08,447
Just a copy of every key
in the school.

395
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,514
By the end of senior year,
I managed to become

396
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:14,559
a member of the trans-american
western custodial union, local 456.

397
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,560
Don't hold me to this, but I believe
I still have voting privileges.

398
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,454
It's been 35 years since
I've wandered these halls.

399
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:25,135
I think I'm gonna take a look around.
You wanna join me?

400
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:27,585
That depends.
Do you have a hall pass?

401
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:30,488
You kidding?
I used to own these halls.

402
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:41,017
Did you bring me a glass of punch
as some sort of 13-year peace offering?

403
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,857
Oh, no.

404
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:45,317
Sorry, these are both for me actually.

405
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:48,769
I can grab you one though
if you'd like.

406
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,751
No. I do have a question
for you though.

407
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,648
Assuming that parker stevenson
had never been born,

408
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:58,443
have you ever seen
a very attractive man

409
00:19:58,444 --> 00:20:00,033
solve a crime before?

410
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:02,788
I did see john cusack prevent
a jaywalking once.

411
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:11,102
This is good.

412
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,404
Yeah.

413
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:16,996
Just, give me a minute.
I'm gonna have to do my thing, okay?

414
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:19,060
You might want to steady
or brace yourself.

415
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:21,282
- Why, what's going to happen?
- Well, I can't really say

416
00:20:21,283 --> 00:20:22,733
with any degree of accuracy.

417
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:25,699
But I can tell you that
some animals, slow adults,

418
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,134
and beautiful girls
have been known to swoon.

419
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:30,242
- You just called me slow.
- Excuse me.

420
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:40,643
Are you okay?

421
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:52,802
I'm a slave to it.

422
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:02,696
Wait for it.

423
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:06,098
Wait for it.

424
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:09,336
Don't do that.

425
00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:10,884
Don't mock the spirit.

426
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,391
It's beneath you.

427
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:21,183
Have you everwondered...

428
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:24,144
Why you haven't been married yet?

429
00:21:24,145 --> 00:21:26,388
I don't have to wonder. I know why.

430
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:28,223
Well, why?

431
00:21:28,224 --> 00:21:29,918
I will get married...

432
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,590
Someday.

433
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:33,888
I just haven't met him yet.

434
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:35,528
You don't think.

435
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,934
- What about you?
- What about me, abigail?

436
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:44,640
Lots of strapping, brilliant-type
guys never got married.

437
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:48,282
Ludwig van beethoven.
Sir isaac newton, right?

438
00:21:48,283 --> 00:21:49,790
Doing his thing.

439
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:51,698
Jon lovitz.

440
00:21:53,548 --> 00:21:56,064
Jon lovitz's brother.

441
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,269
- Jon lovitz has a brother?
- Does it really... Matter?

442
00:22:12,091 --> 00:22:15,008
- I just figured it out.
- What? Why you never got married?

443
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:17,427
No... I know who our murders are.

444
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:22,016
So, wait...

445
00:22:22,017 --> 00:22:24,602
Now you are saying
that howie and eileen are the killers?

446
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:27,181
- Yep.
- Wasn't howie the victim at one point?

447
00:22:27,182 --> 00:22:29,009
That is so 40 minutes ago.

448
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,059
I bet you're still telling
your friends to "chillax."

449
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,486
Why would two people
who just killed someone

450
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:36,072
be so casual: smiling, dancing.

451
00:22:36,073 --> 00:22:38,640
I agree. It is both surreal
and disturbing

452
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:41,210
to watch two murderers
do the cabbage patch.

453
00:22:41,211 --> 00:22:42,834
But that's the point.

454
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:45,368
They're trying to look
as casual as possible.

455
00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:51,144
But I'm not fooled.

456
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:54,201
The question is why
are they sticking around?

457
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,282
Looking for info
on our beloved couple.

458
00:22:58,283 --> 00:23:01,235
Anything that might say
"future killers."

459
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:03,000
What does that word
even mean anyway:

460
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:06,163
"greatness." It's like they purposely
set you up for failure.

461
00:23:06,164 --> 00:23:09,268
I mean, what have I done in my life
that anyone would say was great?

462
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:12,308
Dude, the perfect coa roundness of
your head alone makes you great.

463
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,581
That's easy for you to say.

464
00:23:14,582 --> 00:23:17,330
No one had any expectations
you would amount to greatness.

465
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:20,460
Don't be an incorrigible
eskimo pie with a caramel ribbon.

466
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:22,404
It doesn't matter
what these people think of you.

467
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:24,604
But, and I put this out there
as a challenge to you,

468
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:27,331
you really want to show 'em
you've lived up to your potential?

469
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:31,136
Help me solve this case, please.
Come on, how many of our classmates

470
00:23:31,189 --> 00:23:32,730
are out there solving
a murder tonight?

471
00:23:32,731 --> 00:23:35,289
A handful maybe?
You could be one of them.

472
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:46,157
Ducky.

473
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:48,704
- What?
- Dude!

474
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:51,105
We've been looking
in the wrong john hughes movie.

475
00:23:51,142 --> 00:23:55,365
This isn'tbreakfast club, orcurly sue,
ormr. Mom,and it certainly isn't flubber.

476
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:57,812
- Why are you hatin' on flubber?
- I would never hate on flubber.

477
00:23:57,813 --> 00:23:59,133
I'm not following.

478
00:23:59,134 --> 00:24:01,327
What do all the best
john hughes movies have in common?

479
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:03,838
A love triangle. There's always...

480
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,679
A ducky.

481
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,389
Do you recognize that guy?

482
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,944
Vaguely.
I don't know his name though.

483
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:11,497
Check the grad pics.

484
00:24:14,881 --> 00:24:18,379
He didn't show up.
17 no-shows. He's one of them.

485
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,064
The question is which one.
Ducky, where are you?

486
00:24:22,065 --> 00:24:23,655
Is this the same guy?

487
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,634
Good work, gus. This is good.

488
00:24:32,548 --> 00:24:35,927
I think I just figured something out.
I gotta make a quick stop.

489
00:24:35,928 --> 00:24:38,088
Are we back in business, partner?

490
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:39,978
Milo and otis.

491
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,765
- I get to be otis?
- That's a given.

492
00:24:41,766 --> 00:24:43,790
Okay, but look, I have to get back

493
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,679
to the gym and make sure all the
ballots are in or we won't have

494
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,189
a reunion king and queen.

495
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,546
- Meet you there?
- Yeah. Or we could meet back here

496
00:24:49,547 --> 00:24:52,425
and give each other makeovers
to karla devito's we are not alone.

497
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:53,779
It's your choice.

498
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,816
Dad?

499
00:25:14,543 --> 00:25:16,797
What are you doing here? How did...

500
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:19,279
- How did you even get in here?
- Place was open.

501
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,480
Your mom and I were just
looking around.

502
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:24,224
- She's in the bathroom.
- So what, you just...

503
00:25:25,182 --> 00:25:28,340
You just thought it was a normal
thing so sit here in the dark?

504
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,033
I used to fix up cars
in this very place

505
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,805
when I was in high school.

506
00:25:32,806 --> 00:25:35,858
I actually dropped the tranny
out of a '57 chevy just like this one.

507
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:37,936
Practically rebuilt the thing
from scratch.

508
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:41,509
When that thing was done,
baby, I'll tell you, it purred.

509
00:25:42,516 --> 00:25:44,224
Now I feel awful.

510
00:25:44,225 --> 00:25:45,881
- Why?
- Mom.

511
00:25:46,163 --> 00:25:48,934
She's still in the bathroom.
She missed that entire story.

512
00:25:48,935 --> 00:25:51,955
It's not my fault that you never
cared about anything in high school.

513
00:25:52,061 --> 00:25:55,628
Yeah, well, as it turns out,
it seems I did care about something.

514
00:25:55,862 --> 00:25:58,089
I guess it doesn't matter
much anymore.

515
00:26:01,054 --> 00:26:03,418
Dad, do you think you can
miss out on a moment?

516
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:05,498
- What do you mean?
- Like an opportunity.

517
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:08,371
You think you could miss
an opportunity in a moment.

518
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:10,290
You know, and then it's too late.

519
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:13,178
And the course of your life
is changed forever.

520
00:26:13,366 --> 00:26:15,547
Yeah. Absolutely.

521
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:20,308
Wait a minute.
Is this about a girl?

522
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:21,769
Maybe.

523
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,656
Life is not made up
of a single moment.

524
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:26,893
It's made up
of a gazillion moments.

525
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:28,990
What defines us
is the choice we make

526
00:26:28,991 --> 00:26:31,140
in the next moment,
and the one after that.

527
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:32,774
These moments, shawn,
they're happening.

528
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:35,025
They're all around us all the time.

529
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:40,844
You're having one right now.

530
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:44,590
I just keep wondering, like, what if
I'd made a different choice, you know,

531
00:26:44,591 --> 00:26:47,317
like, on a particular night,
in one of these moments,

532
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,819
- who would I be now?
- Well, I suspect that you

533
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,705
wouldn't be you.

534
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,824
Good talk, dad. I gotta run.

535
00:27:02,306 --> 00:27:04,999
Actually, there is one more thing.

536
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,130
Do you think I could borrow
your underpants?

537
00:27:07,131 --> 00:27:09,561
Just... Just for, like,
ten minutes.

538
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:13,753
Oh, come on!

539
00:27:13,754 --> 00:27:15,169
We're already in the car!

540
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:18,435
These are... These are iconic
film references i'm making tonight.

541
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,592
- His name is peter colter, class of '95.
- Can we hurry this up?

542
00:27:23,593 --> 00:27:25,751
I'm due back in the gym
to make my presentation.

543
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:27,329
If chief vick knew I was
running names for you guys,

544
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,933
- i'd lose my ass.
- We definitely don't want that to happen.

545
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:32,448
- Oh, wait... I have something.
- What is it?

546
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:35,368
Well, it's not criminal,
but it's an accident report.

547
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:38,608
There was an accident
on june 6th, 1995.

548
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:41,144
- That was three days before graduation.
- Peter colter was the driver.

549
00:27:41,145 --> 00:27:43,823
Alcohol was involved.
He hit another vehicle head-on.

550
00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:46,151
A man was thrown from the car 20 feet.

551
00:27:46,152 --> 00:27:48,116
We was rushed to the hospital,
survived in a coma

552
00:27:48,117 --> 00:27:50,954
for seven months and eventually died
from internal injuries.

553
00:27:50,955 --> 00:27:54,115
Peter colter was then charged
with involuntary manslaughter

554
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:56,194
and received six years probation. But

555
00:27:56,195 --> 00:27:58,611
there were two other passengers
in the car with him.

556
00:27:58,612 --> 00:28:00,082
- Let me guess.
- Howie tolkin and eileen mazwell

557
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:03,525
Yeah, how'd you know that?

558
00:28:03,526 --> 00:28:07,036
Because I've seen pretty in pink,
like, 75 times.

559
00:28:07,037 --> 00:28:09,029
Wait, wait,
and here's something else.

560
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,858
Well, it's small, but some petty theft
that was out of state.

561
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:18,941
Shoplifting in fallon, nevada,
which leads me to a restraining order.

562
00:28:18,942 --> 00:28:22,510
It was placed one month ago
by eileen mazwell and peter colter.

563
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:25,058
- For what?
- Harassment.

564
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,639
Peter wasn't driving
the car that night. It was howie.

565
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,250
What, and he took the rap
for the accident? Why?

566
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:37,827
A moment and a choice.
Look, howie and eileen killed peter.

567
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:39,347
I know it all now.

568
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:41,545
- But no body, no crime.
- Seriously, jules?

569
00:28:41,546 --> 00:28:43,799
That has to be on a poster
around here somewhere.

570
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,298
- It's just something we say.
- Wait, so we know who the killers are.

571
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:48,154
We know who they killed.
But we don't have a body?

572
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:50,326
- Where is it?
- Well, if I was just some average guy

573
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:53,497
without any superpowers,
i'd say, I don't know. Why you asking me?

574
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,218
But as head psychic of the santa
barbara police department, i'd say

575
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:01,930
I don't know, why are you asking me?

576
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:04,971
It's still hidden somewhere
at that school!

577
00:29:04,972 --> 00:29:07,390
O'hara, what are you
doing here this late?

578
00:29:07,391 --> 00:29:08,708
I thought you were off tonight.

579
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:12,202
Yeah, you know,
I was out, stopped back by.

580
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:15,211
I, you know, forgot my, chapstick.

581
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,931
Which I now have.

582
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,495
- Where were you at, your prom?
- Why would you say that?

583
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:22,370
Because you're wearing
a prom dress.

584
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:27,851
- And are you two on a case?
- Chief.

585
00:29:27,852 --> 00:29:29,753
Because I don't remember
assigning you one.

586
00:29:29,754 --> 00:29:32,924
- What are you looking at?
- She was helping me. I just made a bust.

587
00:29:32,994 --> 00:29:36,062
- And who is that?
- That is a real schizoid.

588
00:29:36,178 --> 00:29:39,693
Elizabeth reba davis,
a.k.a. Mindy howland.

589
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:43,861
Woman's been filling false prescriptions
under fake names since '96.

590
00:29:45,026 --> 00:29:46,803
I see. Well,

591
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:48,826
good work, people.

592
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:52,834
Oh, and by the way, whatever it is

593
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:55,682
you're really working on,
you're not being paid for this.

594
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:03,692
- Thank you for that, lassiter.
- Yeah, sweet.

595
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:05,400
Look, if you don't mind,
i'm gonna get back to this.

596
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:07,997
I don't want to miss the mug shots.
I'm having fun.

597
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:10,495
It's the best date I've been on
in a long time.

598
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:15,263
He landed here. We know that.

599
00:30:15,554 --> 00:30:17,686
There's no other entrance
they could've gotten into

600
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:20,829
unless they dragged the body 200 yards
all the way back to the gym.

601
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,070
Wait a minute.

602
00:30:30,885 --> 00:30:35,668
- That... Is the girls' locker room.
- Oh, now that he remembers.

603
00:30:36,786 --> 00:30:39,847
How would they even get a body
down there anyway?

604
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:42,230
That's, like, a 13-foot drop.

605
00:30:42,997 --> 00:30:45,412
There's only one way
to find out, partner.

606
00:30:45,413 --> 00:30:47,709
I'm gonna ease you down,
and I'll be right behind you.

607
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,261
You must be out of your damn mind.

608
00:30:49,262 --> 00:30:51,658
- I'm not going down there first.
- Are you kidding me?

609
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,787
You're gonna do this to me now
after I've laid all the ground work?

610
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:56,779
Now will you just get down there?

611
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,718
I don't want to do it.
Help me back up.

612
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:00,126
What do you mean? You're in.

613
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:02,505
- Help me up, shawn.
- All right.

614
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:10,046
Now you, shawn.

615
00:31:12,578 --> 00:31:14,942
Dude, I am so sorry.

616
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:18,411
I didn't realize
I've had the keys all along.

617
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:21,473
- Let's just get to it.
- Okay, indeed.

618
00:31:21,474 --> 00:31:24,003
- Let's find us a body.
- But first,

619
00:31:24,004 --> 00:31:27,160
let's both of us
take a private moment

620
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:29,484
to pay homage to all
of the wonderful things

621
00:31:29,485 --> 00:31:31,931
that have occurred here over the years.

622
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:48,224
Dude, it's howie and eileen.

623
00:31:48,225 --> 00:31:49,887
That's why they haven't left
the reunion.

624
00:31:49,888 --> 00:31:51,431
They stashed the body,
but now they've got to move it.

625
00:31:51,432 --> 00:31:53,228
Yeah, but where is it?

626
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:03,026
Did you hear that?

627
00:32:03,027 --> 00:32:04,976
I think there's somebody
in here with us.

628
00:32:04,977 --> 00:32:07,179
I think it came from the stalls.

629
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,860
Nobody's there.

630
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:45,792
Check the lockers.

631
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:04,636
Do you have a stick
or a small leaf?

632
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:06,495
Why would I have a stick?

633
00:33:27,182 --> 00:33:30,557
We gotta get this body to lassiter if
I'm gonna accuse them of the crime.

634
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:32,157
Why don't we bring lassiter
down here?

635
00:33:32,158 --> 00:33:34,242
Yeah, we come back and
the body's gone again, come on!

636
00:33:34,243 --> 00:33:36,318
If tolkin finds us,
he's gonna strangle us.

637
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:38,450
He strangles people.

638
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:40,563
Head or feet?

639
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:55,698
Were you girls able
to get some punch?

640
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:05,863
What are you doing tomorrow?

641
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,768
Flying to san francisco for work.

642
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:13,179
- You know I'm just here for a little while.
- Yeah, of course. I, just, I...

643
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:17,477
Actually, I thought you might want
to see my elementary school.

644
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:20,607
- You did?
- Yeah, sure, this is...

645
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:22,827
This is only half the picture.

646
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:33,007
Yeah! That was fun, right?

647
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:39,391
So it is now time to announce
the reunion prom queen and king.

648
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:42,057
Howie tolkin!

649
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:49,475
And his real life bride,
eileen mazwell!

650
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:53,024
Where you going?

651
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:55,300
Howie, eileen, come up here!

652
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:00,569
This is exciting.

653
00:35:02,882 --> 00:35:04,891
Congratulations.

654
00:35:04,973 --> 00:35:07,570
Looks like history has repeated itself.

655
00:35:08,037 --> 00:35:10,743
Those crowns sure are heavy.

656
00:35:10,753 --> 00:35:12,119
Yes, they are.

657
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,798
Heavy with lies.

658
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:18,996
You see, my fellow alumni,
one of your classmates

659
00:35:19,121 --> 00:35:21,617
was murdered here tonight.

660
00:35:21,618 --> 00:35:24,761
His name was peter colter.
He was a smart kid.

661
00:35:24,762 --> 00:35:26,101
He was a wiz at fixing cars.

662
00:35:26,102 --> 00:35:28,037
He was also the water boy
for the football team.

663
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:30,639
The reason you probably
don't remember him very well

664
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,949
is because he lived in their shadow.

665
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,349
He worshipped them,
do anything for them,

666
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:39,205
including taking a rap
for a tragic car accident

667
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:42,427
that was actually caused by howie.

668
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:46,533
And you let him do it
because you didn't want to lose

669
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:48,990
your precious scholarship.

670
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:53,090
Poor peter's life was stuck in that
moment, and he never recovered.

671
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:55,105
That's why he didn't show up
to take his yearbook photo,

672
00:35:55,106 --> 00:35:58,645
and that's why he moved away
and ended up committing petty crimes.

673
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:02,385
Meanwhile, the two of you
moved on to ucla.

674
00:36:02,386 --> 00:36:04,053
You married your prom queen.

675
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:06,275
Probably never gave your old
friend peter another thought.

676
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:07,655
That is...

677
00:36:07,656 --> 00:36:09,469
Until about a month ago.

678
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,311
Isn't that right, eileen?

679
00:36:11,312 --> 00:36:13,792
Seeing it's no coincidence
that the restraining order

680
00:36:13,793 --> 00:36:17,539
the you filed against peter just
happened to coincide with howie here

681
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,812
announcing his candidacy
in the state assembly.

682
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:21,711
Peter couldn't take it anymore.

683
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,759
He needed the truth to come out,
so he contacted you.

684
00:36:24,777 --> 00:36:26,065
You two did everything you could

685
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:28,843
to prevent him from coming
here tonight, but he came anyway.

686
00:36:28,844 --> 00:36:30,784
He wore his letterman's jacket

687
00:36:30,793 --> 00:36:33,865
with his special state
championship pin.

688
00:36:33,866 --> 00:36:37,141
Still stuck in that one moment.

689
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:39,665
He visited all his old haunts.

690
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,832
Made a stop at the auto shop.

691
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:45,689
Got a little upset
when he saw the trophy shrine

692
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,256
built to celebrate you.

693
00:36:47,257 --> 00:36:50,806
Finally, he confronted you both
on the roof, drunk and upset.

694
00:36:50,807 --> 00:36:52,577
You couldn't let him uncover
the truth.

695
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:54,866
It was way too much to lose.

696
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:57,913
So you gave him one final push.

697
00:36:57,914 --> 00:37:01,155
Silenced him once and for all.

698
00:37:01,426 --> 00:37:04,437
Three arrests in one night. Not bad.

699
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:06,050
Please tell me you have a body.

700
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:08,671
- It's the furry sabercat backstage.
- Great!

701
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:11,056
Stand up, please.

702
00:37:11,057 --> 00:37:12,417
Up.

703
00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:15,466
Homicide howie,
ladies and gentlemen.

704
00:37:17,204 --> 00:37:19,517
And now I'd just like
to take this opportunity

705
00:37:19,518 --> 00:37:21,932
to thank someone
who's not only responsible

706
00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:24,848
for planning all of this tonight,

707
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:29,456
complete with a rastafarian theme
that you all embraced so heartily,

708
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:33,315
but who is also the mastermind
behind the solving of tonight's crime.

709
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:35,638
I know it's true, i'm the psychic.

710
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:41,055
But, often times my revelations
are nothing but a cryptic mess.

711
00:37:41,056 --> 00:37:44,609
Tonight, for instance, all I could see
were scenes frompretty in pink,

712
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,987
a giant rhombus in a t-shirt
that read "soccer moms are easy."

713
00:37:47,988 --> 00:37:50,252
Now I don't know
what these things mean,

714
00:37:50,253 --> 00:37:54,947
but gus is somehow able to shape them
into cold hard evidential facts.

715
00:37:54,948 --> 00:37:58,017
But that is not what makes him great.
No, sir.

716
00:37:59,115 --> 00:38:02,206
Burton guster has been my best friend
since we were five.

717
00:38:02,386 --> 00:38:05,707
And maybe, just maybe,

718
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:08,167
if any of you can look
yourselves in the mirror

719
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:10,877
and know that you've been
half as good a friend

720
00:38:10,878 --> 00:38:13,693
to someone else
as gus has been to me...

721
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:17,377
Well, you too
can be considered great.

722
00:38:18,454 --> 00:38:23,141
Give it up, for my best friend,
burton guster.

723
00:38:29,035 --> 00:38:31,179
We must've done something right.

724
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:33,838
That was all you.

725
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:36,510
You know that's not true.

726
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:49,038
I must say that was quite impressive.
If you're that good of a detective,

727
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:51,976
I can only imagine
what sort of midwife you made.

728
00:38:52,493 --> 00:38:55,950
Okay, this is 13 years overdue,
but here goes.

729
00:38:55,951 --> 00:38:57,891
I know that you think
that I didn't show up

730
00:38:57,892 --> 00:39:00,324
the night I was supposed
to meet you at the carnival,

731
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:02,909
but the truth is I did.

732
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:06,260
You were standing at the end
of the pier.

733
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:09,759
You were wearing a blue,
thin-striped baby doll dress.

734
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,305
Doc marten sandals, black.

735
00:39:12,472 --> 00:39:15,792
You had a row of red butterfly
clips in your hair,

736
00:39:15,793 --> 00:39:18,092
short jean jacket
and the right pocket was ripped

737
00:39:18,093 --> 00:39:22,203
because you always used to shove your
fist in there when you got nervous.

738
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:24,909
You were pacing back
and forth that night.

739
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:28,470
You waited around almost an hour
before you walked away.

740
00:39:29,986 --> 00:39:33,594
These are our tickets
to the carnival.

741
00:39:33,595 --> 00:39:35,138
I saved them.

742
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,332
I was so nervous, I choked.

743
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,470
And you know what?
That hardly ever happens to me.

744
00:39:39,471 --> 00:39:43,516
But the truth is, abigail,
I think I liked you too much.

745
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:49,742
And somewhere in the back of my head,
I knew what that night would mean

746
00:39:49,743 --> 00:39:53,199
and even how my life
could be different now

747
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,309
if I hadn't let you walk away.

748
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:58,255
But this is a different moment,

749
00:39:58,256 --> 00:40:01,003
and it's a chance to make
a different choice.

750
00:40:01,004 --> 00:40:05,086
And you're really amazing,
and I know we can't go back

751
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:08,072
in time, but I do wish that
there was some way that I...

752
00:40:22,936 --> 00:40:26,494
So I'll just keep thinking,
and if there's anything

753
00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:31,200
that comes to mind, i'll let you know
that was... Really nice.

754
00:40:31,201 --> 00:40:33,498
- Pretty much perfect.
- Yeah.

755
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:38,014
Pretty much perfect.

756
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,611
So where do we go from here?

757
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,318
I don't know.

758
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,280
Maybe this is what...

759
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:51,102
Closure feels like?

760
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:52,834
Maybe.

761
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:58,454
I guess I'll see you
at the 20-year reunion.

762
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:01,645
Yeah... Though knowing gus
it'll probably be our 23rd,

763
00:41:01,646 --> 00:41:04,347
Dear leland bosseigh high
administrative board.

764
00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:08,213
We accept that you are with holding our
deposit of $1,500 for damages.

765
00:41:08,214 --> 00:41:11,212
We also accept that you just
see us as you want to see us:

766
00:41:11,213 --> 00:41:14,724
in the simplest terms,
in the most convenient definitions.

767
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:18,314
A snarky psychic, an uptight
pharmaceuticals salesman,

768
00:41:18,315 --> 00:41:21,113
a pretty female blonde detective,

769
00:41:21,114 --> 00:41:23,954
and a not so pretty,
unusually lanky detective.

770
00:41:23,955 --> 00:41:26,570
But each of us
is all of those things.

771
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:28,989
Plus our normal fee
for solving a murder

772
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,035
in one meaningful evening
is twice that.

773
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:33,907
So enclosed is a bill for $3,000.

774
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,202
Please remit payment
in the form of a check

775
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,826
made out simply to "psych."

776
00:41:38,827 --> 00:41:40,958
