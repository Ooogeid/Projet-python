1
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:18,404
Look at us, man.

2
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:20,705
We got it pretty good, huh?

3
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,397
Living in Santa Barbara.
Beautiful night.

4
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,420
Two perfect women on our arms.
How'd we do it?

5
00:00:27,547 --> 00:00:29,171
Is this pocket square okay?

6
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:30,668
Yeah. Looks great.

7
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:34,431
Wait, are those the right glasses
for these drinks?

8
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:37,536
Be cool. We got this.

9
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:43,724
We're back.

10
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,837
What does a lady have to do
to get a dry martini?

11
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,769
Patience is a virtue.

12
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,456
So are broad shoulders, but it doesn't
mean I like to wait for them.

13
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,988
- Cheers, ladies.
- Cheers.

14
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,950
Are you all right?

15
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,809
Would someone please tell me
why you would drag Gus and I

16
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:39,775
out of bed in the middle
of the night

17
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,436
to come down here and tend
to an elderly woman

18
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,395
who is simply resting her eyes?

19
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:47,595
This is not a crime scene.
She's not dead.

20
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:50,067
You're not dead.

21
00:01:56,524 --> 00:01:59,090
Will you focus, Shawn?
We need this case.

22
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,134
Do something.

23
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,928
I can clearly see a victim.

24
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,447
In the prime of his life.

25
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,283
We don't need your particular brand
of theatrics here this evening.

26
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,809
Go home. Go back to bed.

27
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:26,145
Lassie, are you kidding me?

28
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,884
The death of this man is like
staring my own mortality in the face.

29
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:32,163
If someone is out there killing handsome
and youthful bachelors in santa barbara,

30
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:33,736
then all of us are in danger.

31
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:36,781
Maybe not all of us.
Certainly Gus and myself.

32
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,616
We've been here all of 8 min.

33
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,701
He slipped off the balcony and fell.

34
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:44,265
In that case, we should all be looking
for a banana peel or a roller skate.

35
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,575
Perhaps a wet bar of soap, though
that seems the unlikeliest of the three.

36
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,003
Please escort
these gentlemen out of here.

37
00:02:57,831 --> 00:02:59,637
Okay, Lassie. Okay, you win.

38
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,932
No reason to get excited.
Buzz, I think we can see ourselves out.

39
00:03:06,856 --> 00:03:09,430
No sign of wrist fractures
or ankle fractures.

40
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:11,893
Tell me this guy didn't try
to brace his fall from 20 feet.

41
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,577
Start getting statements.

42
00:03:13,702 --> 00:03:15,851
Who do you want,
the creepy old ladies or the Ken dolls?

43
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:17,097
The Ken dolls.

44
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:22,810
We're still waiting for toxicology
to confirm, but he was dead

45
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:25,496
before he hit the ground.
Appears to be poisoning.

46
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:26,872
So kudos, Mr. Spencer.

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,123
Sorry, Carlton.

48
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:31,252
In Lassie's defense,
toxicology is not a science.

49
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,087
It's a science of studying toxins.

50
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:36,277
Get out of here. I guess that does
make you look a little foolish.

51
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:39,213
You know what, I've got
the home run suspect on this one.

52
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:41,637
Once I was given five minutes
to collect my thoughts,

53
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:44,466
I recognized the victim's date
as one Gillian Tucker.

54
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,212
Formerly Mrs. Gillian Vanderholt.

55
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,688
I thought I recognized her.
She was married to Walter Vanderholt.

56
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:54,316
Closed the case on his suicide,
but something never sat right with me.

57
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,776
What are you getting at?

58
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,157
I think she murdered her husband
and got away with it.

59
00:03:58,282 --> 00:04:00,406
Now she's dating our victim
and suddenly he's dead too?

60
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,283
Come on, chief.
Let me run with this one.

61
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,579
What if we let them work together?
Separately, but together?

62
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:09,549
That lonely bald guy
in the corner makes no sense.

63
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:12,471
Am I the only person that's freaked out
he's been sitting there the whole time?

64
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,153
Henry, this is your call.
You're the one in charge of consultants.

65
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,632
You're not afraid
of the competition.

66
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:22,177
No, as long as it doesn't involve
people trying to best each other.

67
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:24,098
Well, I'm up for it.

68
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:26,624
Matter of fact, I've already won.

69
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,207
504
"Chivalry Is Not Dead... But Someone Is"

70
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,775
Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

71
00:04:59,302 --> 00:05:01,866
Let's bag and tag everything
in the victim's medicine cabinet

72
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:04,261
and move on over to Gillian
the cradle robber's.

73
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:09,557
Why is it that a wealthy older man can
date a younger woman and he's a hero,

74
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:12,724
yet an older woman chooses to empower
herself and date a younger man,

75
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:15,182
she's considered some sort
of social pariah?

76
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:16,707
'Cause it's gross.

77
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,454
- What the hell are you doing?
- Sorry, Lassie, it was not my intent

78
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:23,656
to cause you to make that noise
in front of the group.

79
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,182
But in order to get
into the mindset of the victim,

80
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:28,118
I rented <i>American Gigolo</i> last night.

81
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:31,330
- You think this is prostitution?
- Lance Tolkin didn't have a job.

82
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:34,541
He's dating a woman twice his age

83
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:37,876
and has a Super Troopers
pinball machine in his bedroom.

84
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:39,588
It didn't pay for itself.

85
00:05:47,854 --> 00:05:49,710
Gus, I'm gonna need some help here.

86
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,427
Just stay out of our way, Spencer.

87
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:12,291
Killing with Class:

88
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,540
the art of seduction
through charm and sophistication.

89
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:18,122
Question is
"who exactly is he killing?"

90
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:23,637
"To Lance, one of my most artful
and gentlemanly students.

91
00:06:23,762 --> 00:06:24,823
"Happy hunting.

92
00:06:24,948 --> 00:06:26,662
"Cordially, Clive Prescott."

93
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,437
Gus, I do believe
we found a lead of our own.

94
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,140
- How's your feet?
- I can't feel them.

95
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,889
- Sweet.
- Wait, Gus!

96
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,735
I need you to be my legs!

97
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:49,579
Gentlemen, if you want
to continue to spend your nights

98
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:51,890
with diner waitresses
and tollbooth attendants,

99
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:54,453
then by all means
carry on your miserable way.

100
00:06:54,578 --> 00:06:57,575
But if you want to surround yourself
with sophistication,

101
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,100
with elegant women

102
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,045
who can give you anything

103
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,954
your heart desires,

104
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,460
then ask yourself the question
what is the picture

105
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:08,093
that you are painting of yourself?

106
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,219
What is this?
Like, <i>Fight Club</i> for butlers?

107
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,930
For instance, what did these two...

108
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:15,726
boys do wrong?

109
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:18,353
There must be some sort of mistake.
We're not students.

110
00:07:18,524 --> 00:07:21,899
I'm psychic detective Shawn Spencer.
This is my partner, Chaz Bono.

111
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,086
"Psychic detective." Gentlemen,
this is just what I am talking about.

112
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,027
If you're going to create
a fake occupation,

113
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:28,655
at least make it sound real.

114
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:31,325
- I'm also a pharmaceutical salesman.
- That sounds pathetic.

115
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,904
And it's certainly not sexy.

116
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:38,363
Seriously, dude,
this whole gentleman thing's not for me.

117
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:40,978
I mean, it's a little bit dated,
don't you think?

118
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,530
What I think is that with my method,

119
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:46,769
there is no eligible woman
I couldn't seduce.

120
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:49,107
How about you?

121
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:53,655
Let's just say I do fine
on my own, okay?

122
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,598
I'm good.

123
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:55,891
Really?

124
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:57,281
Really?

125
00:07:57,493 --> 00:07:59,436
What do you mean really?
What do <i>you</i> mean really?

126
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,065
- When was your last relationship?
- Define relationship.

127
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,408
"The way in which
two or more concepts, objects,

128
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,637
"or people are connected
or the state of being

129
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:09,659
"connected." Webster.

130
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,211
I hardly think Emmanuel Lewis
is an authority on relationships.

131
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,661
- May I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.

132
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:18,080
Have you ever been tested
for idiocy?

133
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:20,214
We're here to conduct
official police business

134
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,945
and we've got some pretty
serious questions for you

135
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,213
about the death of one
of your students. Lance Tolkin.

136
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:31,301
Gentlemen, I think
we can call it a day.

137
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,731
I'm telling you,
she's not gonna show.

138
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:43,772
- She's probably halfway to Acapulco.
- Let's not jump to conclusions.

139
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:47,577
Gillian Tucker is still a very prominent
woman in this town.

140
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,576
In my book, it's pretty cut and dry.

141
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:53,429
This sick twist sees an opportunity
to off her rich, older husband

142
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:55,670
and then she gets herself
a little boy toy.

143
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:58,403
But who knows?
Maybe he figures out her secret.

144
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,108
So she decides to off him too
and it's on to the next set of pecs.

145
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,874
Maybe the killing feels good.

146
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,587
Like the soft, supple flesh
of a man-buck.

147
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:08,130
You disturb me.

148
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:10,940
And your theory on this murder
disturbs me.

149
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:12,509
And you disturb me.

150
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,553
- You said that twice.
- Yes.

151
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,630
I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting, officers.

152
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:20,017
This whole ordeal... Since it happened,
I'm just beside myself.

153
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,061
I find it difficult
just getting out of bed.

154
00:09:23,391 --> 00:09:25,480
Miss Tucker, thank you very much
for coming down here.

155
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:27,524
We just have a couple of questions.

156
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,109
Please have a seat.

157
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:37,659
Do you recognize me, Miss Tucker?

158
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:42,222
I was the detective looking
into your late husband's suicide.

159
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:46,335
I believe that was a much younger man.
Less salt and pepper.

160
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:51,324
We are very, very sorry
for your loss, Miss Tucker.

161
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:54,593
And, seriously... I'm sorry...
You just got out of bed?

162
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:58,139
You know, you have a funny way
of mourning.

163
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,475
You didn't waste any time getting
back up on that horse after his death.

164
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:05,646
I'm late for a business meeting.
And I don't ride horses, detective.

165
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:08,148
Miss Tucker,
are you trying to seduce me?

166
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:11,568
Not even a little.

167
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:15,015
I'm not gonna lie,
I was not in a happy marriage.

168
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,075
But I have my own way of mourning
and I assume you have yours as well.

169
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:22,008
What is a woman my age supposed
to do, detective, knit?

170
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:25,444
Carlton, can I talk to you
for a second?

171
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,093
Now?

172
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:35,509
Carlton, she is not going
to a business meeting.

173
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,812
- I think she's going on a date.
- What makes you say that?

174
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,764
Who's she doing her hair
and makeup for, you?

175
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:42,338
Maybe.

176
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:44,648
It's called being a detective
and a woman.

177
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:48,146
She's being interviewed by two cops
and she's primping like that?

178
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,354
Not for a meeting.

179
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:52,167
If she's lying about where she's going,
she's lying about other things too.

180
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:53,525
Maybe you're right.

181
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,988
- We should tail her.
- That's not what I said.

182
00:10:56,277 --> 00:10:59,154
Would you stop disagreeing with me
when I'm agreeing with you?

183
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,853
- Can you tell us about lance Tolkin?
- "Can I"?

184
00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:08,834
Meaning do I have the neurological
and verbal ability to do so?

185
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:10,657
Sorry. Will you?

186
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:13,714
- I've heard it both ways.
- Maybe on a farm you have.

187
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:16,258
Lance Tolkin
had not yet mastered the art

188
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:19,636
of... manners.
I'll leave it at that.

189
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:22,431
I'm sensing the exact opposite.

190
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:26,685
Didn't you refer to him
as one of your most "artful" students?

191
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:30,105
One point for you, psychic.

192
00:11:30,878 --> 00:11:32,607
Did something happen
between you two?

193
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,160
Was he a good student?

194
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:36,852
- Did he show potential?
- Perhaps more than the others.

195
00:11:36,977 --> 00:11:39,977
He was good. But maybe not
as good as he thought.

196
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:43,035
You sound a little angry.

197
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,976
Anger is easy.

198
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:47,851
A gentlemen takes his ire
and turns it into insight.

199
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:50,834
That's in chapter three of my book.
Good day.

200
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,569
What is that?

201
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,918
"Dear gentlemen,
thank you for your inquiries

202
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:05,791
"about the death
of my former student Lance Tolkin.

203
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:09,339
"Good luck with the investigation.
Cordially, Clive Prescott."

204
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,482
It's a thank you note.
This is what i'm talking about.

205
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,359
This guy's playing with us, Gus.

206
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:18,098
This whole gentleman thing
is a sham.

207
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:20,697
I'm gonna prove it too.

208
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:27,537
Eyes peeled, O'Hara.

209
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:30,504
This is where we let her
hang herself.

210
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:35,087
Guster, what the hell...?

211
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,173
That's a good way to get yourself shot.
What are you wearing, Spencer?

212
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:40,074
I ain't Spencer.

213
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:41,790
I'm soup can Sam.

214
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:44,241
And unlike some detectives,
when Gus and I show up

215
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:46,848
for a stakeout, we try to blend in
with the regular people.

216
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,365
Who's Gus supposed to be?

217
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,678
I'm a regular guy in a car.
I'll blend in fine.

218
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:53,480
At least someone finally realized
who the right suspect is.

219
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,044
I guess someone did.

220
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:57,901
Wait, he thinks we're tailing her?

221
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,736
She's obviously meeting
a new boy toy.

222
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,988
Maybe one even younger
than the last.

223
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,056
Younger?

224
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:05,180
Who do you think
she's meeting with, Justin Bieber?

225
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,787
Lassie, have you considered
that she's the victim here?

226
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:10,252
Here we go.

227
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:14,918
- Who the hell is that?
- That's our guy.

228
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:17,587
- Clive Prescott.
- Shawn, what are you getting at?

229
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,966
We know who the murder is.
And we have the home run suspect.

230
00:13:21,373 --> 00:13:24,302
And he is Santa Barbara's
biggest dirty rotten scoundrel.

231
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,548
The cops already got my statement
the night of the crime.

232
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:33,172
I know. We read your statement,
but we have questions of our own.

233
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:35,554
We now believe someone may have
poisoned Mr. Tolkin's drink.

234
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,545
Do you remember what his
drink orders?

235
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,297
Normally I wouldn't,
but his caught my attention.

236
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:42,646
It was different. Classy.

237
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,305
Yes. Sea breeze.

238
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:47,534
Gabardine hightail.

239
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:50,053
Two parts brora scotch.
One part Drambuie.

240
00:13:50,178 --> 00:13:52,873
A teaspoon of honey.
It was Mr. Tolkin's favorite.

241
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:55,584
In fact, Miss Tucker brought
her private bottle of brora scotch

242
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,926
for me to keep behind the bar
just for Mr. Tolkin.

243
00:13:58,051 --> 00:13:59,177
Did she now?

244
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:00,932
We're gonna need that bottle.

245
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:07,746
Yes, Dad.
We're following him now.

246
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,931
I'm surprised you didn't ask
to sit in the back seat.

247
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,618
Your hunch was more than good.

248
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:13,310
Prescott's last known liaison

249
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,928
was Lorraine Belle,

250
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,322
one of the wealthiest widows
in Santa Barbara.

251
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,702
Maybe we should check her out
when we're finished here.

252
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:21,776
It's gonna be kind of hard.
She's dead.

253
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,619
She went on vacation
with Prescott to South America.

254
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:27,544
Never came back.
Died in a drowning accident.

255
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,749
That's interesting, pop,
but he's slowing down.

256
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:30,994
We got to go.

257
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,798
I think this guy's dangerous.
I want you to be careful.

258
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:34,914
<i>I promise.</i>

259
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,334
I think my dad's
starting to like me.

260
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:42,503
Look at that, Gus,
he's literally taking her to the bank.

261
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,129
What's the next stop, the cleaners?

262
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,879
Dude, I thought you said
we were just gonna follow him.

263
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:56,004
That wouldn't be very much fun
now would it, Gus?

264
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,902
- What are you gentlemen doing here?
- I'm here to see my money.

265
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:07,944
They keep it in a special room
in the back with a trampoline.

266
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:11,321
I'm gonna roll around in it for a while.
Maybe make it rain.

267
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:13,510
Sort of like that movie
<i>Indecent Proposal</i>

268
00:15:13,635 --> 00:15:14,913
except no sex... Maybe sex.

269
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,588
I'm Shawn Spencer.
Psychic Detective for the SBPD.

270
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:25,382
I'm sensing that you enjoy the company
of younger men.

271
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:30,470
And for obvious reasons,
I can't take my eyes off of you.

272
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,243
If you're done sniffing us,
we have an appointment.

273
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:38,368
Excuse us.

274
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:43,204
- What the hell was that?
- The manager's hair?

275
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,910
You heard my dad. This guy fleeces women
and they end up dead.

276
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:50,148
We got to keep him away from her,
slow down this train

277
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:51,970
until we have the proof
that we need.

278
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:54,709
Are you trying to prove you have
more game than this guy?

279
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,518
I've never been more offended.

280
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:58,146
That would be a nice bonus.

281
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,721
You're on your own.

282
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:12,021
I apologize for being so abrupt,

283
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:14,930
but as a psychic,
my gift is connection.

284
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:17,838
Knowing without saying.
Learning without asking.

285
00:16:17,963 --> 00:16:19,811
Eating without chewing.

286
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:23,106
It would be my pleasure to accompany you
on the town this evening.

287
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:25,755
Perhaps we could paint it purple

288
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:28,776
since we were both born in February.

289
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,156
That's amazing.
How did you do that?

290
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,588
Little bit of this,
whole lot of that,

291
00:16:33,713 --> 00:16:35,200
and just a tinge of...

292
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:38,414
Would you mind if I had a word
with Mr. Spencer?

293
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,709
What are you doing?

294
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,966
I'm flirting with a newly widow
that happens to be your dear friend.

295
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:46,252
You're way out of your league.
So why don't you back out?

296
00:16:46,377 --> 00:16:49,609
- You think I can't handle your game?
- It's not a game. First mistake.

297
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:51,968
You just pushed my competitive button
and now it's on.

298
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:54,471
I'd be frightened if you were
wearing any buttons.

299
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:57,140
Miss Tucker, I am so sorry
to have exposed you

300
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,032
to these juvenile antics.

301
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:02,096
I think he's rather adorable.

302
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,480
So is a gibbon, but have you
ever tried to eat with one?

303
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:07,848
Now, this man-boy here
lacks all culture, elegance,

304
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:09,535
and he smells of buffalo wings.

305
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,561
That is where you are wrong, sir.

306
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:14,598
What you're smelling
are buffalo wing flavored

307
00:17:14,723 --> 00:17:16,657
Snyder's pretzels of Hanover.

308
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,038
- It's America's pretzel.
- And Hanover's, obviously.

309
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:24,376
Do you see now why this
would be such a bad mistake?

310
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:27,002
Gillian, have you ever dated
a man who was triple-jointed?

311
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:29,714
No, I can't say that I have.

312
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,218
That's a shame. I was hoping to discuss
it with you tonight on our date.

313
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:37,419
I must say you are an original,
Shawn Spencer.

314
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:39,932
And I think it would be
a breath of fresh air to dine with you,

315
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:42,088
and precisely what I need right now.

316
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:43,520
You've got to be kidding me.

317
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:48,715
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to leave right now

318
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,193
or I'm not gonna be ready
for tonight. I'm sorry, Clive.

319
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:55,031
Guess you'll have to open
this safety deposit box some other time.

320
00:17:57,734 --> 00:17:59,048
One stipulation.

321
00:17:59,173 --> 00:18:01,922
My friend Eugenia was recently
disappointed by a gentleman friend

322
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:05,208
and she could use some company.
Do you have someone for her?

323
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:07,293
As a matter of fact,

324
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:10,797
I have the perfect gentleman.

325
00:18:13,611 --> 00:18:15,176
Shawn, this isn't happening.

326
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:18,191
Gus, don't be George Hamilton's reaction
when Ashley came to him

327
00:18:18,316 --> 00:18:20,442
and said "Dad, I think
I'll become an actor too."

328
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,767
Keep an open mind.
This is about solving a murder.

329
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:25,937
Hello, ladies.
Your tramps have arrived.

330
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:29,977
First things first.

331
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,242
I always like to give a little
get-to-know-you something.

332
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,235
My goodness.
I don't know what to say. This is...

333
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:45,956
This is a little bit awkward,
only because I don't wear earrings.

334
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:47,869
I mean, I used to back in the day.

335
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,246
Three of them. But that was
just because of tears for fears.

336
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:53,757
- Shawn, those are cufflinks.
- Course they are. Don't be ridiculous.

337
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,471
Would you care for some gum?

338
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:04,063
I only have one piece left.

339
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,600
We could split it.

340
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,775
Eugenia's been staying with me
since Walter died.

341
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:14,017
She doesn't like to go out much.

342
00:19:14,142 --> 00:19:16,501
It hasn't worked out with any of the men
I've set her up with.

343
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:18,426
Maybe Gus will be the one.

344
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,450
Genie, isn't Gus handsome?

345
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,334
Eugenia, don't look.
Don't look. Don't look.

346
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:29,450
Gabe McKinley's over there
with that tramp, Olivia Ainsley.

347
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,130
Gabe was Eugenia's date at the benefit.
It didn't work out.

348
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:36,070
I can't imagine why.

349
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:39,717
We both are so sorry to hear that.

350
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:43,619
- You're not pulling your weight.
- I'm trying.

351
00:19:43,744 --> 00:19:45,570
Every time I smile at her,
she puckers at me.

352
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:47,185
I'm not used to the pucker.

353
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,165
She's into gardening.
Ask her about flowers.

354
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,131
- I don't know anything about flowers.
- Just ask her something!

355
00:19:52,576 --> 00:19:53,576
Sorry.

356
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,445
Exactly how old are you?

357
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:01,712
This is the Limoux Viventi
Cabernet Dumont.

358
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,512
- May I?
- "May you" or "can you"?

359
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,487
- He got it right the first time.
- All right.

360
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,375
Actually, we haven't ordered wine.

361
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,684
This wine is compliments
of the gentleman sitting right there.

362
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,831
He's getting up. Take him out.

363
00:20:19,956 --> 00:20:21,463
- "Take him out"?
- Sweep the leg.

364
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,930
- I'm not sweeping his leg.
- Why won't you ever sweep the leg?

365
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,832
Good evening, everyone.

366
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,436
This is unfortunate, isn't it?
To walk all the way over here

367
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,882
only to discover that there is not room
at this table for you.

368
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:37,527
Don't be silly.
There's an empty seat.

369
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:39,445
Thank you
for that gracious invitation.

370
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:43,169
I don't know how much
of a wine connoisseur you are,

371
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,618
but I think you will find the Dumont
both nutty

372
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:47,856
and shy.

373
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,322
Very familiar.

374
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:51,541
That was Gus on the first day
of kindergarten.

375
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,464
It's true. You didn't talk to anyone
and you peed in your cubbyhole.

376
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:56,650
I'd say that's pretty nutty,
wouldn't you?

377
00:20:56,775 --> 00:20:57,775
Excuse me.

378
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:01,745
I'm going to join her.

379
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:05,722
- What's up? What's up?
- You boys play nice.

380
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:08,518
Not together.

381
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,658
Look at you.

382
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:16,358
You're a chicken at a slaughterhouse,
and I've just rattled your cage.

383
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,357
You're right about the cage.

384
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:22,054
But I'm a rabid hamster
and I'm just getting started, Jack.

385
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:23,949
- Hello, Professor.
- Mr. McKinley.

386
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,450
You're with miss Ainsley

387
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:27,489
Why, yes, I am, sir. First date.

388
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:29,887
Seems to be going well.
Good for you.

389
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:32,332
Think you've dated everyone
in this restaurant.

390
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:35,419
Well, sir, I learned
from the very best.

391
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,714
But perhaps I'm not as good
as Mr. Spencer.

392
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,467
You're here with miss Tucker?I was under
the impression she was off limits.

393
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:43,635
Off limits?

394
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:47,889
Well, yes. Everyone was fair game
except for her. Isn't that right?

395
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,226
That makes you
a very brave man, Mr. Spencer.

396
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,145
No one use first names anymore?

397
00:21:53,418 --> 00:21:54,753
Hey, good luck.

398
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,232
Yeah, won't be needing any of that.

399
00:21:59,491 --> 00:22:02,114
What's the deal with...
I don't... it goes...

400
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,824
We must remember this wine
when we go to Peru.

401
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,661
Oh, yes. Clive is taking me
on a business trip to South America.

402
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,038
I invest in art.

403
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:15,292
And he found a wonderful painter in Lima
that he thinks I might be interested in.

404
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,677
<i>She went on vacation
with Prescott to South America.</i>

405
00:22:18,844 --> 00:22:21,214
<i>Never came back.
Died in a drowning accident.</i>

406
00:22:22,814 --> 00:22:25,552
- Gillian, it's a little stuffy in here.
- Little bit.

407
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,919
Why don't you say
the four of us roll on out,

408
00:22:28,086 --> 00:22:31,592
hit some place
a little less prescotty.

409
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,978
Where did you have in mind?

410
00:22:40,313 --> 00:22:42,768
Creates the perfect crisscross.

411
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:45,498
That's it. Symmetry.
Symmetry.

412
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:49,117
Allowing all the toppings
to snuggle up and get warm

413
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,109
under a blanket of cheese.

414
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:52,511
And bite.

415
00:23:01,221 --> 00:23:03,522
This makes no sense.
How could she not be into me?

416
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:05,457
- Why do you care?
- Now I do.

417
00:23:05,624 --> 00:23:07,520
No one over the age of 32
shuts this down.

418
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,721
Stop thinking about your ego
and focus on this case.

419
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,521
- My ego?
- Gillian,

420
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,559
I for one am having
a marvelous time.

421
00:23:15,012 --> 00:23:16,144
Mm. Me too.

422
00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:20,148
But I need to ask you
a teensy-weensy little favor.

423
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,275
Actually, it's more like this.

424
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:26,530
For the next couple of days,
do you think that you could

425
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:29,648
not speak to
or hang out with Prescott?

426
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:31,660
And also not go
to Peru with him either?

427
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:34,730
Shawn.
Are you already jealous?

428
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,765
Not sure how I feel about that.

429
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:39,007
Clive is just a friend.

430
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:43,449
You want to touch my head?

431
00:23:43,762 --> 00:23:46,605
Women of all ages and races
say it has

432
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,244
magical powers.

433
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,262
I'm good.

434
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:57,075
Lassie and Jules.
Well, what a surprise.

435
00:23:57,242 --> 00:23:59,845
One... Gus, I thought
you put a sock on the door.

436
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,155
One second.

437
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:07,519
I know your type.

438
00:24:07,686 --> 00:24:11,536
You don't like "The Telegraph."
You like your man to surprise you.

439
00:24:12,574 --> 00:24:13,618
I hear that.

440
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:16,455
What are you doing in our space?

441
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,325
We don't want to rain
on your early bird special,

442
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:21,793
but you should know
you're dating our prime suspect.

443
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:25,422
This is not a date. Come on.
We're working. This is an investigation.

444
00:24:25,704 --> 00:24:27,249
We get it. It's hard out there.

445
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,052
Not everybody has as many choices.
Don't be ashamed.

446
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,602
You don't think
Gus and I are interested in these women?

447
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:35,480
I don't know about you guys,
we're trying to solve a murder here.

448
00:24:45,924 --> 00:24:47,574
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

449
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:54,534
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

450
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,736
Oh. Oh, that?
It's not what it looks like.

451
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,196
No. We get it.

452
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:03,959
While you and Spencer are exploring your
disrtubing new fetish for older women,

453
00:25:04,142 --> 00:25:06,338
O'Hara and I were discovering
we were right about Tucker.

454
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,546
Gillian had access
to the bottle of scotch

455
00:25:08,713 --> 00:25:11,551
Lance was going to be drinking
that night and she may have poisoned it.

456
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,387
Was he drinking
a gabardine hightail?

457
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:17,487
Prescott created that drink.
It's in his book.

458
00:25:18,256 --> 00:25:20,406
Prescott taught Lance everything.

459
00:25:20,704 --> 00:25:23,688
He knew what he would order. Prescott
could've easily spiked that punch.

460
00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:25,983
Now, if you don't mind, Gus

461
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:29,402
is a little busy trying to get some
sweet nookie off his old auntie.

462
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:32,197
- For the case.
- For the case.

463
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,323
Good luck.

464
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,233
Go get 'em, tiger.

465
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:47,587
Gus, I can imagine a world where I get
a little frisky with Gillian Tucker.

466
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:52,338
I don't think I need to round the bases.
Slide into 2d safely feels sufficient.

467
00:25:53,406 --> 00:25:55,527
I got the double pullback, Shawn.

468
00:25:55,694 --> 00:25:59,099
She rejected me. I mean, what is that?
She smelled like mothballs.

469
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,810
Sometimes you smell
like styrofoam. I dig it.

470
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,491
- What are you talking about?
- I never told you that before?

471
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:05,708
Bottom line

472
00:26:06,408 --> 00:26:08,998
is we kept Prescott
away from Gillian.

473
00:26:09,546 --> 00:26:11,820
He backed off.
Means we win, right?

474
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:17,983
I don't feel right. I hate to say this,
but I think we may have gotten

475
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,036
bad pineapple on pizza.
How's your stomac?

476
00:26:20,286 --> 00:26:21,664
- I'm fine.
- Really?

477
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:25,291
Maybe it wasn't pineapple.

478
00:26:26,773 --> 00:26:29,462
Maybe somebody got to my wine
at the restaurant.

479
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:39,598
Gus, I see a bright light.
I should go towards it.

480
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,706
- Stop playing, Shawn.
- I'm going.

481
00:26:41,873 --> 00:26:44,728
- Take care of my great Dane Lothar.
- You don't have a great Dane.

482
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,646
Get a great Dane!
Name him Lothar!

483
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,982
- What are you talking about?
- I was poisoned.

484
00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:50,442
I'm sure of it.

485
00:26:50,931 --> 00:26:52,582
But I know who killed me.

486
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:56,479
Remember, it was Prescott
who killed me.

487
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,630
Shawn, the doctor's here
to talk to you.

488
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,379
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Spencer,
but there's no question.

489
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,969
- You were poisoned.
- Oh, God, Gus, I knew it.

490
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,096
I told you.
I told you I was poisoned.

491
00:27:23,082 --> 00:27:26,686
Shawn, I slept with Stacey Whitaker,
at the cabin, summer of junior year.

492
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:29,522
I know you had a crush on her
and I'm really sorry.

493
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,484
There's also no question
you're going to be fine.

494
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:37,509
When I say sleep,
I mean literally sleep.

495
00:27:37,676 --> 00:27:39,826
I was so tired that night.
I mean pooped.

496
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,550
Sawing logs.

497
00:27:43,256 --> 00:27:44,739
You were barely poisoned.

498
00:27:44,906 --> 00:27:46,748
There were just traces
in your system.

499
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,335
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You mean I'm not gonna die?

500
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,351
Maybe from all the tapioca pudding
and raisins in your stomach,

501
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:54,798
but not from the poison.

502
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,050
That was my tapioca, Shawn.
You son of a...

503
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,343
- Shawn, how are you?
- Papa.

504
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:01,554
Daddy, come.

505
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:03,196
Come closer.

506
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,773
Come and hug me.

507
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:09,259
Shawn. Lassiter is interviewing Gillian
and Prescott at the station.

508
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:12,565
You should be there. I vouched for you.
Do not make me look like a fool.

509
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:15,026
- Dad, I was poisoned.
- I heard "barely."

510
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:17,153
Come on. Get your pants on.
Let's go.

511
00:28:17,403 --> 00:28:19,153
What are you do...?
Aah!

512
00:28:20,328 --> 00:28:22,958
Where were you after you left
the restaurant last night?

513
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,829
Detective, have you ever read
Lady Chatterley's Lover?

514
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,455
Let's stay on point.

515
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:31,001
- So you haven't read it?
- In college. It was a long time ago.

516
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,751
It's just that
with your corn silk hair,

517
00:28:34,017 --> 00:28:35,755
you might've stepped
out of its pages.

518
00:28:37,078 --> 00:28:40,635
Do you, like Lady Chatterley,
feel trapped emotionally?

519
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:43,384
Longing? The need...

520
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:45,974
the desire to be held?

521
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,103
This flowery crap
actually works on you?

522
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,554
If you had read the book,
you would understand.

523
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:55,921
This man has actual insight
to the psyche of a woman.

524
00:28:56,688 --> 00:28:58,738
I saw all the Emmanuelle movies

525
00:28:58,972 --> 00:29:00,895
including the one
where she changed races.

526
00:29:01,062 --> 00:29:04,314
I think I have plenty of insight
into the female psyche. Thank you.

527
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,620
Will you admit that your book is dated
and that I have more game than you?

528
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,425
- I will not.
- All right.

529
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:12,667
Will you admit that you tried to murder
me last night by poisoning my person?

530
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,588
I certainly will not. My understanding
is that you were barely poisoned.

531
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,341
Okay, why do people
keep qualifying that?

532
00:29:20,532 --> 00:29:22,469
Mr. Prescott,
you have my sincerest apologies.

533
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,597
You're free to go. Pick up your id
with the officer at the front desk.

534
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,308
What? Are you kidding me?
Did you come in here to kid me?

535
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,227
I let Gillian go too. We don't have
enough to hold them.

536
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,988
Hey, dad, get in here.

537
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,497
No, my other father.
Would you please come in here?

538
00:29:38,347 --> 00:29:40,513
Look, you have been on my side
from the beginning.

539
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,330
You cannot allow them
to release this guy.

540
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:47,513
I know you from somewhere, don't I?

541
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,749
Yes.
Yes, I remember you now.

542
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,511
A gentlemen never forgets a name.

543
00:29:52,678 --> 00:29:55,377
Let's see. Henry.
Henry William Spencer.

544
00:29:55,969 --> 00:29:58,338
He's the only student
I ever had to kick out.

545
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,075
You got kicked out?

546
00:30:00,242 --> 00:30:03,192
You didn't kick me out.
You invited me to leave.

547
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:05,316
Read between the lines, sir.

548
00:30:07,446 --> 00:30:10,706
Oh... Oh, dad, this is good...
This is too good.

549
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:14,127
This is too rich.
Not only did you take the seminar,

550
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:16,359
you were invited to leave?
Oh, my God, dad.

551
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:18,358
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Focus.

552
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,258
One more. Chandler Bing style.
Oh, my God!

553
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,575
Look, we can still nail this guy.

554
00:30:23,742 --> 00:30:27,742
Prescott was dating another woman.
A Harriett, uh, Finestatt.

555
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,119
He was seeing her
at the time of her death.

556
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,288
A month later,
the company goes kaput.

557
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:33,920
Great that's what we need.

558
00:30:34,087 --> 00:30:36,751
Shawn, I want you to give me some time
to substantiate all this.

559
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,129
You are so close.
It's starting to take shape.

560
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:42,319
I want you to start
to think like a detective.

561
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,884
We sit on it. Got it?

562
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,134
Got it.

563
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,392
The idea is to attack and conquer.
Love doesn't come to you. Go find it.

564
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:55,143
Slay it if necessary,
but get it and bring it back.

565
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,460
- Any questions?
- I've got one.

566
00:30:57,936 --> 00:30:59,710
Oh, brother. Yes?

567
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:04,153
Why is that you will stop at nothing to
steal women's money and murder them?

568
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,698
- That's ridiculous and untrue.
- Really?

569
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:10,421
Well, then perhaps you wouldn't
mind talking to the class

570
00:31:10,588 --> 00:31:12,579
about the death
of Harriett Finestatt.

571
00:31:12,857 --> 00:31:15,940
What do you want me to say?
You want me to talk about her cancer?

572
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,460
How I was at her bedside
for months and months?

573
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:21,999
Or should I tell you
about how her ungrateful sons

574
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:24,924
took all of her money and drove
her business into the ground?

575
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:27,052
Neither of those things.

576
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:29,929
Obviously we're very sorry
for your loss. But...

577
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:33,516
What about the woman
in South America, hmm?

578
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:36,311
The one who supposedly drowned.
Come on.

579
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,649
Lorraine?
She was killed by a stingray.

580
00:31:38,816 --> 00:31:41,858
Now unless you're accusing me
of hiring a sea creature as a hit man...

581
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:43,821
Okay, well, tell me this:

582
00:31:43,988 --> 00:31:46,362
What do you do when an older woman
spurns your advances?

583
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,623
Gus, come on.
A little decorum.

584
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,863
What? You just accused him
of death by stingray.

585
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:55,497
Well, why was Gillian
off limits then, huh?

586
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,209
- Why don't you paint us that picture?
- You want a real picture?

587
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,740
I do want the real picture. So drop the
gentleman act and say something real.

588
00:32:02,907 --> 00:32:04,582
- Why Gillian?
- Because...

589
00:32:04,749 --> 00:32:07,675
- Because what?
- Because I love her!

590
00:32:09,729 --> 00:32:10,887
Because I love her.

591
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:12,579
All right?

592
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:14,465
I am a cad

593
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:16,735
and a deceiver.

594
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:18,585
And I am hopelessly,

595
00:32:19,185 --> 00:32:20,735
ridiculously in love.

596
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:35,787
"Dear Prescott, I am deeply sorry

597
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,822
"that I accused you of trying
"to kill me. Good day."

598
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:41,969
"I said good day, sir. Signed:"

599
00:32:42,136 --> 00:32:45,797
- "Shown Spencer." You misspelled it.
- I did that on purpose.

600
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:48,174
I was in a hurry
and I didn't have spell check.

601
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,924
You need spell check
for your own name?

602
00:32:51,323 --> 00:32:53,972
- Gus.
- So what are you gonna do now?

603
00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:58,059
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Guster,
my advice is just words on a page.

604
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,264
"Attack and conquer." It's nonsense.

605
00:33:00,431 --> 00:33:04,106
It doesn't work with a person
of actual substance like Gillian.

606
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,850
I've got to do something.

607
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,017
Gentlemen,

608
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:08,987
I'm going to propose.

609
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:12,249
Exciting for you.

610
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,451
No, for you. It's terrifying for me.
I have no idea what I'm doing.

611
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:17,745
So I'm asking Eugenia for tea.

612
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,248
I hope her friend can help me
on how to approach her.

613
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,084
She's not as stingy with her advice
as she is with her gum.

614
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,170
Oh, well, you have to take
into account her circumstances.

615
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,298
- What circumstances?
- You don't know?

616
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,926
Eugenia's penniless.
Gillian takes care of her.

617
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,008
<i>My friend Eugenia was disappointed</i>

618
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:46,441
<i>by a gentleman friend
and she could use some company.</i>

619
00:33:46,844 --> 00:33:47,983
Dude,

620
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,509
Gabe McKinley was dating Eugenia.

621
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:53,031
He broke up.

622
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,824
He realized she had no money.

623
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,827
His buddy scored the big fish, Gillian.
Gabe was jealous.

624
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,913
Jealous enough to poison him
to get him out of the way.

625
00:34:01,603 --> 00:34:03,503
<i>Jealous enough to poison me.</i>

626
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,263
- Slightly.
- Yes.

627
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,795
Call Jules and Lassie.

628
00:34:13,578 --> 00:34:15,878
Where's Gabe McKinley?
Where is he?

629
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,650
On three.

630
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:46,639
- Yes, I'll hold.
- Stop.

631
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,716
This is what Gabe was drinking.

632
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:54,133
Looks like we may have another
poisoning on our hands.

633
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,263
Cufflinks.

634
00:35:04,388 --> 00:35:05,588
Wait a minute.

635
00:35:06,223 --> 00:35:09,649
Gabe was having an affair with Gillian
and that is the reason that he is dead.

636
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:13,027
Lance was dating Gillian and that is
the reason that he was poisoned.

637
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:17,571
And because I went on one date with
Jillian, someone tried to poison me.

638
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:20,803
- Now I'm saying it.
- Thank you.

639
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,482
That was the lab.
The toxicology reports are conclusive.

640
00:35:23,649 --> 00:35:27,208
The principal toxin found in the poison
that Lance ingested is naphthalene.

641
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,627
- Naphthalene! What-phthalene?
- Naphthalene.

642
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,351
- Naphthalene?
- It's usefull?

643
00:35:31,518 --> 00:35:33,819
In more ways than one.
Mothballs, Shawn.

644
00:35:33,986 --> 00:35:35,645
Eugenia smelled like mothballs.

645
00:35:35,812 --> 00:35:37,994
But it wasn't her.
It was the garden.

646
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:40,049
The main ingredient is naphthalene.

647
00:35:40,216 --> 00:35:41,431
- Naphthalene?
- Enough.

648
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:45,059
She used them as a pesticide, but
they become lethal if they're ingested.

649
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,515
It's the perfect old person's
murder weapon.

650
00:35:54,682 --> 00:35:56,165
- The mothball.
- Of course.

651
00:35:56,332 --> 00:35:58,950
She used to poison
Gabe's energy drink and Lance's scotch.

652
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,658
Send me a thank you note later.

653
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,479
You have seven days.

654
00:36:02,646 --> 00:36:04,787
Yeah or you should really try
to do it sooner.

655
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,122
Where is Eugenia?

656
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,403
With Prescott.

657
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,570
Oh, no.

658
00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:11,677
He's about to drop the bomb
that he's gonna propose to Gillian.

659
00:36:11,844 --> 00:36:15,194
If we don't get there in time,
he's victim number three.

660
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,335
Cripe's sake.

661
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,645
Come on!

662
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,640
Move those vehicles!

663
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,068
Let's go!

664
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:38,279
- We must get up before it's too late.
- I know.

665
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:40,452
Am I supposed to shoot my way?

666
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,122
- I will.
- Or...

667
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,285
Shawn, what are you doing?
Get back!

668
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,796
We take a shortcut!
We'll meet you up there!

669
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:48,873
Meet them up there?
Do you lost your mind?

670
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,373
Oh, screw this.

671
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:54,670
What are you doing?

672
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,215
Carlton!
Come on.

673
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,427
Come on.
There we go, you...

674
00:37:05,828 --> 00:37:07,350
- Great.
- Son of a...

675
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,238
Shouldn't a case with an older woman
killing people be less athletic?

676
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:14,256
Hang in there, buddy. Think about
the cucumber finger sandwiches

677
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:16,108
waiting for us up top.

678
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,743
- May I help you?
- We need to get in.

679
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,079
Of course you do.
Do you have a reservation?

680
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:30,832
I'm afraid I cannot seat you
without a reservation.

681
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,755
However, I'd be more than happy
to recommend another tea service

682
00:37:33,922 --> 00:37:35,461
where perhaps pinecone chips

683
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,161
are an accepted part
of the dress code.

684
00:37:38,617 --> 00:37:40,341
You don't have a reservation.

685
00:37:49,094 --> 00:37:51,194
Prescott!
Don't drink that tea!

686
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,274
Good lord.
Please control yourself.

687
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,943
- There is a lady present.
- She is not a lady.

688
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:01,069
She is a murderess.

689
00:38:01,236 --> 00:38:02,523
And a lesbian.

690
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:06,606
We'll get to that in a minute.
Isn't that right? Think about it.

691
00:38:06,773 --> 00:38:09,609
No one stood to lose more
than Eugenia

692
00:38:09,776 --> 00:38:12,874
if Gillian got serious with somebody.
You're in love with her.

693
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:17,128
It was always just the two of you. And
it always would be. Lassiter was right.

694
00:38:17,756 --> 00:38:21,299
Gillian's late husband Walter did die
under mysterious circumstances.

695
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,343
But not at Gillian's hands.
At yours.

696
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:27,318
Isn't that right, Eugenia?

697
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,637
<i>Eugenia live with me since Walter died.
She doesn't like to go out much.</i>

698
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:34,061
<i>And it hasn't worked out
with any men.</i>

699
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:37,648
Poor Gus here never stood a chance.

700
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,193
You only had eyes for Gillian.
Of course.

701
00:38:41,443 --> 00:38:43,362
That's why she gave me the pullback.

702
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:47,158
- She gave you the pullback?
- No one appreciated her like I do.

703
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:49,822
She always chose the wrong man.

704
00:38:50,724 --> 00:38:53,018
I wanted what was best for her,

705
00:38:53,975 --> 00:38:55,894
and to make sure
she didn't get hurt.

706
00:38:56,061 --> 00:38:57,611
I was protecting her.

707
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,476
Boo-hoo. Stand up.

708
00:39:00,643 --> 00:39:04,443
You better cuff her before
she kills everyone in this restaurant.

709
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:06,928
Hands behind your back.

710
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:11,269
I always thought Gillian and I
would spend our final days together.

711
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,425
Come on, lady.

712
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:15,977
Let's go.

713
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:22,610
As you know, I shall not

714
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,864
be teaching the class for the next
2 weeks, as I shall be on my honeymoon.

715
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:29,659
Yes. But I have arranged
during that time

716
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,044
to present you with the wisdom
of several guest speakers,

717
00:39:33,211 --> 00:39:36,021
the first of which is a man
I've come to know quite well

718
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:37,416
over the last week.

719
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,168
So without further ado,

720
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,477
I present to you psychic detective

721
00:39:43,305 --> 00:39:46,267
and true gentleman, Shawn Spencer.

722
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,828
You know, my best friend Burton Guster
said that we could all afford

723
00:39:56,995 --> 00:40:00,495
to be a little more gentlemanly in life.
And you know what?

724
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,858
He was dead wrong about that.

725
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:05,478
But I'll tell you what I can see.

726
00:40:05,645 --> 00:40:08,921
The way I think is the right way
to do things is not

727
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,491
the only way.

728
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,535
- It's barely a way.
- It's my way.

729
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,082
- It's not a real way.
- If it's the way I do,

730
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:17,289
- it qualifies as a way.
- Not a very good.

731
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:19,500
- Clive you should settle down.
- All right.

732
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,836
We can all afford to grow up a bit.

733
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,671
- Even me.
- Especially you.

734
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,721
Truth is, I want to change.
I need

735
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,801
- to change.
- You got that right.

736
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,846
I want my father on his deathbed...

737
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,629
four or five years from now...

738
00:40:35,796 --> 00:40:37,796
to look at me and say "that...

739
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:40,407
"that is the man that I raised."

740
00:40:40,574 --> 00:40:43,565
And I want him to be pointing
at some other guy.

741
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:47,361
Because that means that maybe,
just maybe, I am not his biological son.

742
00:41:07,235 --> 00:41:10,259
Hello. Thanks for taking
the time to see me.

743
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,709
- What do you want?
- Okay. Okay.

744
00:41:13,532 --> 00:41:16,782
It's not a huge deal.
I just need to hear it from you.

745
00:41:18,091 --> 00:41:20,118
You not being interested in me,

746
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:22,337
that's solely because, you know,

747
00:41:22,504 --> 00:41:24,440
that you are, you know.

748
00:41:25,055 --> 00:41:26,589
In love with a woman?

749
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,019
Yes. That.

750
00:41:30,008 --> 00:41:31,542
You do realize I'm in here

751
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:34,950
because I'm being charged
with a triple homicide, right?

752
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,536
Yes. I get it. You're busy.

753
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:38,936
I'm busy too.

754
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,482
It's been bothering me because you dated
that other guy in the beginning,

755
00:41:43,649 --> 00:41:46,968
- at the benefit.
- Yes. But I killed him.

756
00:41:48,936 --> 00:41:50,607
Right. I hear that.

757
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,720
Would you have felt better
if I had tried to kill you too?

758
00:41:56,201 --> 00:41:57,556
Well, you know,

759
00:41:58,137 --> 00:42:01,954
you should meet
a nice girl and focus on her.

760
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,160
And never ever come back here.
