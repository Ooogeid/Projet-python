1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,356
I'm still waiting, Shawn.

2
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:13,124
Okay, I'm gonna take your pointy,
sad-faced guy for my horsey guy.

3
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:15,478
Stop, stop.
What is this piece called?

4
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:17,598
I call him Dwight.

5
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:20,493
- What is this one called?
- B.A. Baracus.

6
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:22,316
Look, Shawn, if you're gonna
play this game,

7
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:24,300
you're gonna have to learn
what the pieces are called.

8
00:00:24,377 --> 00:00:25,924
What if I don't wanna
play this game?

9
00:00:25,957 --> 00:00:27,891
Chess is important.
It's about strategy.

10
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:30,399
It's about anticipating
your opponent's next moves.

11
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:33,498
- This game is an allegory for life.
- An alle-what?

12
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:35,226
Look, when you're on the force,

13
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,447
you're gonna have to take in
huge amounts of information.

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,984
Alibis, motives, witness statements.
And trust me.

15
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:43,753
If you wanna win, this is not stuff
that you're gonna make up as you go.

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,394
Do you understand? And I want you
to focus and get serious.

17
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,816
What?
What are you trying to say?

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,961
- I can't remember what it's called.
- What did I just...

19
00:00:56,994 --> 00:00:58,707
Never mind. I remember.

20
00:00:58,769 --> 00:00:59,830
Checkmate.

21
00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:02,814
Bye, dad.

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,714
- Tell me. Is he cheating on me?
- Jury's still out.

23
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:16,169
Do you have something that he's
touched recently?

24
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:19,973
I have the receipt from lunch.

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,072
I'm sensing that he
always takes you out for lunch.

26
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,688
That he never pays with a
credit card. Always cash.

27
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,771
- That's right.
- I'm also sensing that you

28
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:35,716
can only call him at the office
or on his cell phone.

29
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,425
- Never, ever at home?
- That's dead on.

30
00:01:38,602 --> 00:01:40,558
You must get goosebumps
being around him.

31
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,000
- Oh, I get something.
- Daphne, I have good news and bad news.

32
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:45,713
The good news is he's not
seeing someone else.

33
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:47,100
The bad news...

34
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:49,544
- He's married.
- What?

35
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:52,138
Are you sure?

36
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:55,006
Just tell him a friend told
you he was married

37
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,796
and his face
will tell you the rest.

38
00:01:57,522 --> 00:02:02,845
But... when the mourning period is over,
this is my friend Gus's card.

39
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,437
He's a good listener,
and he's willing to change

40
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,900
everything about himself for a girl.

41
00:02:05,932 --> 00:02:09,203
Shawn, I do not... no, no.
You keep that. Please.

42
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:14,957
Shawn, we've reached
a certain level of success.

43
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,874
If you wanna keep doing these "is my
boyfriend cheating on me" cases,

44
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:19,374
you're gonna have to do
them without me.

45
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,418
Gus, you continue
to underestimate me.

46
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:23,451
I'll have you know
that right now, as we speak,

47
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:24,548
we're on our way to the office

48
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:27,156
to meet with two gentlemen
named Shockley and Goddard

49
00:02:27,202 --> 00:02:29,390
- who have a very big case for us.
- So what are we talkin'?

50
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:30,959
Robbery? Missing persons?

51
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:33,214
They want us to look
into the serious matter of...

52
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:36,739
Well, that actually
wasn't in the e-mail.

53
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:39,568
- So how do you know it was real?
- They used all caps, Gus.

54
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:42,445
- The meeting's at 2:00. We better hurry.
- It's 2:18.

55
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,682
Well, somebody had to have the Belgian
chocolate fondue. Didn't they?

56
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:47,063
That was you, Shawn.

57
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:49,145
Well played, sir.

58
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,915
Just let me do the talking.
I don't want you to scare them off

59
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,225
with your non sequitur
ridiculousness.

60
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:02,291
Please tell me you're not
Mr. Shockley and Mr. Goddard.

68
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:36,352
Okay, before one of us goes all crazy
and demands the other one apologize

69
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:40,071
for taking a case from a couple grade
schoolers, let's just hear them out.

70
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:46,592
- What can we do for you, gentlemen?
- One of our teachers is a murderer.

71
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:50,546
- Okay, I'm sorry. Please, continue.
- He's killed before.

72
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:52,535
And in two days,
he's gonna kill again.

73
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:54,670
And the cops don't listen to us
'cause we're kids.

74
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:58,629
Okay, well, since we're here, and
we don't have another meeting for...

75
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,452
A week, which one of your teachers is
going to do this terrible thing?

76
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:04,303
- We don't know.
- Who's been murdered?

77
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:06,159
- We don't know.
- Who's the next victim?

78
00:04:06,197 --> 00:04:08,566
- We don't know.
- Perfect. I have no more questions.

79
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:11,112
- Shawn.
- I got nothing.

80
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:15,159
- Can we just start from the top?
- Yes. That's a great idea.

81
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:17,358
Well, Shock and I go to Meitner, and...

82
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,314
The Meitner school for gifted students?

83
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,801
- These kids are geniuses.
- Technically, near genius.

84
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:26,777
The school has some pretty cool stuff.
So we broke in late at night.

85
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:27,870
Say no more.

86
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:31,590
- Fight club.
- No, to hack into a space probe

87
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:33,976
and see if we could get it
to blink a word in old morse code.

88
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:34,939
Which word?

89
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:36,944
- Boobs.
- Boobs.

90
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:39,375
You went from all that trouble
just to get some nasa techs

91
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:41,452
- to scratch their heads?
- Yeah.

92
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,000
- Come on, Gus. That's kinda funny.
- While reconfiguring the receiver,

93
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:46,757
we accidentally tapped into
a cell phone call

94
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:49,082
being made from the Meitner campus.
It was staticky.

95
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:52,014
But we heard a deep, gravelly voice
talking to their cousin.

96
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:54,700
- Someone named Muriel.
- And you want us to figure out why

97
00:04:54,718 --> 00:04:56,574
someone would name their kid Muriel?

98
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,025
The voice said something like,

99
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:01,323
"I'm not gonna be pushed
into a corner again."

100
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:03,205
are you sure it wasn't
dirty dancing?

101
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:07,488
And then we also heard verbatim
"if I have to, I'll kill him.

102
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:11,258
"It won't be my first time.
By wednesday, he's a goner."

103
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:13,851
A goner?
It may have been James Cagney.

104
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:15,630
Shawn, can I have a minute?

105
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:20,189
We're taking this case.

106
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,670
You want to take this case?

107
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:25,286
It's a chance to go undercover
in high school a la 21 Jump Street.

108
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:26,657
Obviously, I'm Johnny Depp.

109
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,838
Sadly, you can only pass
for Holly Robinson.

110
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:30,047
Why can't I be Richard Grieco?

111
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,028
Why would you want to be
Richard Grieco?

112
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:33,666
Isn't this the part where you say,

113
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:38,160
"there ain't no case here, Shawn."
just a couple kids crying wolf.

114
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:40,721
I don't sound like Richard
Roundtree, Shawn.

115
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:43,298
- Why are you so eager?
- Same as you.

116
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:44,378
I was a king in high school.

117
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:46,390
Just because you carried a
scepter doesn't make you a king.

118
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:49,200
- That's because I was In Macbeth.
- Dude, you played banquo's kid.

119
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:51,341
You guys, can you help us?

120
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:54,882
Is a lizard's skin dry and cracked?

121
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:02,000
We believe that it is.

122
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:13,765
Guess what today is.

123
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,300
It's not one of those
touchy-feely holidays

124
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,356
invented by card companies
to goad me into buying a present

125
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:18,660
for somebody I couldn't care
less about, is it?

126
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:21,535
- No, today's our anniversary.
- Come again?

127
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,596
It's been one year to the day
that I came to Santa Barbara

128
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:25,867
and we got partnered up.

129
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,135
- I didn't get you a present.
- I don't want a present.

130
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:30,081
That's what all women say.

131
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:32,365
But believe me, deep down,
you want a present.

132
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:34,841
My soon-to-be ex-wife
always hated what I gave her.

133
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:36,962
- What did you give her?
- Cash, mostly.

134
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:42,138
Anyway, this anniversary means that
my one-year probation period is over.

135
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:45,125
So what I want, that is,

136
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,400
what would be good,
what I'm trying to say is...

137
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,973
I think I'm entitled
to be primary on a case.

138
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,702
How late are the shops open tonight?

139
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,343
Chief Vick says molding
young officers is your duty.

140
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,155
And she's already approved this.

141
00:06:58,611 --> 00:06:59,948
Now give me a case.

142
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:02,485
Fine.

143
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:06,795
Let's see.

144
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:08,154
Homicide.

145
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:11,142
That's a bit messy for your
first time. Hi-tech burglary.

146
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,009
You need a lot of forensics
for that one. Bake sale slap fight.

147
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:17,583
Seems easy, but believe me,
I worked one once.

148
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:20,031
- Had to call in S.W.A.T.
- Oh, come on.

149
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:21,872
All right.

150
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:25,584
Couple kids came in complaing
about one of the teachers.

151
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,689
Are you sure there's nothing of
lower priority for me to handle?

152
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,643
Lesson number one, O'Hara.

153
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:34,179
There are no small cases,
only small detectives.

154
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:37,326
Let's roll.

155
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,233
Ah, high school.

156
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,327
You know, I've always wanted to prove
that one of our teachers was a monster.

157
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,559
You remember our freshman music
teacher, Mrs. Jorgenstorm?

158
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,182
- She was a nightbreed.
- She was not.

159
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:51,814
- She used to date Craig Sheffer.
- She did not.

160
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:53,604
She wore a ton of make-up
and lived in a cemetery.

161
00:07:53,622 --> 00:07:55,600
- Next to a cemetery.
- So she claimed.

162
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:59,150
If I remember correctly, you were always
too afraid to follow her home.

163
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,982
- So any leads yet?
- Hold it there, Doogie.

164
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:03,500
First things first.
Where do I get a juice box?

165
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:06,519
- And does it come in grape-a-licious?
- Shouldn't you be doing psychic stuff?

166
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:09,934
Someone could be killed in the next
48 hours. Possibly one of us.

167
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:12,893
If you're so smart,
why don't you solve the thing?

168
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:14,586
Midterms? Duh.

169
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,735
I need to maintain my G.P.A.
to keep my scholarship stipend.

170
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,046
All right, all right, all right.
Clearly, we have to get inside.

171
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:22,609
What's our cover gonna be?
Wait, I've got it.

172
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:24,927
You're the preppy jerk who's dating
the girl I'm in love with.

173
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,681
I'm the lonely cafeteria guy who mows
lawns and has a heart of gold.

174
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:29,349
Let it go, Shawn.
You can't pass for a teenager.

175
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:32,226
Yeah, he's right.
You got rhytids around the eyes.

176
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:34,091
- What did he just say to me?
- Crow's feet.

177
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,700
Do you squint or make
funny faces a lot?

178
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:39,087
You guys are all nuts.

179
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:41,894
If I grew my hair out, raised my
voice an octave, I could...

180
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,777
Stop, Shawn.
I've already worked it out.

181
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,102
We're documentarians working on a
new film called "Teeniuses in the mix".

182
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:49,762
- Teeniuses?
- Yes.

183
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:51,164
Really, dude?

184
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,662
You've got Teeniuses right
on the tip of your tongue?

185
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:56,225
- In the mix.
- We already got your cover story.

186
00:08:57,201 --> 00:09:00,339
Personally, I'm not sure
that I see the merits of a class

187
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:03,587
in paranormal studies,
but we do let the students

188
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:06,424
choose one guest instructor a semester.

189
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,883
C. Everett Koop was crushed
that he didn't get it.

190
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,710
What is this?
Like a study hall?

191
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:15,656
Oh, no. Recess.

192
00:09:19,218 --> 00:09:21,572
Does it Smell Like Teen Spirit in here?

193
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:37,524
So tell me, Headmaster, can a former
applicant request his or her file?

194
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:39,448
Oh, no. Why?

195
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:43,348
Oh, for the general public's general
welfare. You know, generally.

196
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:47,780
Debbie will give you the forms
you'll need to sign.

197
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:53,783
- An application, Gus?
- Just curious.

198
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,037
You applied to this school
back in the day. Didn't you?

199
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:58,402
- And you didn't tell me about it.
- Who can remember that far back?

200
00:09:58,435 --> 00:10:01,816
W-whoa, is that why you cried
for a month when we were ten?

201
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:04,700
Because they rejected you?
Get down.

202
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:12,510
Excuse me. O'Hara.

203
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,059
Lesson number two.
Cops don't wait in line.

204
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:19,010
They go straight to the front.
Even at Starbucks.

205
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:23,143
Hi, SPBD. Can I please get the class
schedules for these students? Thank you.

206
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,044
Lesson number three.

207
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:25,757
Don't say "please",
don't say "thank you,"

208
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:28,277
and definitely don't say "hi."
Spirit Squad auditions

209
00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:31,882
were over ten years ago. You're
an authority figure. Act like it.

210
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:33,501
Ever heard "you catch more flies
with honey"?

211
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:34,515
Lesson number four.

212
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,648
Don't quote cornpone country bumpkin
sayings to your commanding officer.

213
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:40,183
- How many lessons are there?
- 638.

214
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,807
Welcome to the Meitner
school for gifted children.

215
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,325
- How may we... It's a miracle.
- Thank God, you're all right.

216
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:51,539
We heard a cop named Lassie died.
Jules, tell me you got the flowers.

217
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:53,827
Lassie three was a retired police dog.

218
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,708
From the obit, it's amazing
what you two had in common.

219
00:10:58,748 --> 00:11:02,420
- Strong, dedicated, loyal.
- Bouts with ringworm. Expressive eyes.

220
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:04,453
Goes like this after he poops.

221
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,246
Seriously, are you guys
working my case?

222
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:12,331
Case? What case?
No, no, no, no.

223
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:14,386
They've been after me
for a while to teach a class.

224
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,579
What do we say?

225
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:20,047
Oh! Right.

226
00:11:20,355 --> 00:11:23,681
Stay out of our way
and don't get involved, Spencer.

227
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:28,170
This place is overwhelming.
Where do we even start?

228
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:31,010
Easy. Who were the eyes and ears
of Dufman elementary?

229
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:33,871
Mr. Graves, the custodian.
We had a special bond.

230
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:39,543
Custodians have access
to the building at night.

231
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:41,040
He could be our bad guy.

232
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:47,164
If he has a deep and gravelly voice,
he's el suspecto primero.

233
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:52,818
How you doing?

234
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:55,721
I'm mopping up vomit.
How do you think I'm doing?

235
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:58,524
By the way, those mats in front of
the doors are to rub your shoes on.

236
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:00,060
Thanks for the extra work.

237
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,081
Sorry about that. Uh, I'm Shawn
Spencer, psychic lecturer.

238
00:12:05,114 --> 00:12:07,699
And I sense that something
is amiss in your universe.

239
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:10,602
- Yeah, my lumbago's flaring up.
- Nope, not that.

240
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:12,492
Something a little more
out of the ordinary...

241
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:13,879
Something... anything?

242
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,111
Can't you just tell me
what you're looking for?

243
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:17,962
Did something happen here
on Friday night?

244
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:25,617
- Nope. Nothing springs to mind.
- I can sense you're lying.

245
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,003
The spirits tell me that your
little pants are on fire.

246
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:35,269
Fine. I found this weird gold pin
when I had to work late Friday night.

247
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:38,816
When I mopped this area, no pin. But when
I circled back to wax, there it was.

248
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,549
So you're saying it got here
in the middle of the night?

249
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:42,505
Who do I look like?
Jake and the fatman?

250
00:12:42,523 --> 00:12:46,346
All I know is that after two weeks in
the lost and found, it's mine. Legit.

251
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,238
Where is this lost and found?

252
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:54,877
Who loses a microscope and
doesn't come looking for it?

253
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,914
Ear infection medicines. Inhalers.

254
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:02,594
What appears to be 168 pairs
of hideous eyeglasses.

255
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:12,664
S.X.Y. Apparently, our perp is
so sexy, he felt the need.

256
00:13:12,686 --> 00:13:15,515
to die cast it onto steel
and wear it on his lapel.

257
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:16,861
That's not an s.

258
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:20,278
That's the integral sign in calculus
for the area under the curve xy.

259
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:23,184
Whoever was skulking around here
after hours must be a math teacher.

260
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:25,278
How many math teachers work here?
Four or five tops?

261
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,206
18.

262
00:13:26,926 --> 00:13:29,182
It's all right. I have a plan.

263
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:32,133
It's a scary one. We'll have to rely
on all our animal instincts.

264
00:13:32,172 --> 00:13:35,979
We... are going to the teachers' lounge.

265
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,666
Try to blend in. Act natural.

266
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:46,839
How 'bout these kids today, huh?

267
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:50,374
Oh, my god, look
at this selection of donuts.

268
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:52,231
This is pathetic.

269
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:55,556
Who left a tenth?
I wanna know how that makes sense.

270
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,351
- You...
- Shawn, focus. Math teacher.

271
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:02,715
- There's no math teachers here.
- How do you know?

272
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,890
That guy's been wearing goggles.
He's clearly a chem lab teacher.

273
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:12,600
Violin hickey.

274
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:13,981
Music teacher.

275
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:17,120
However, a gym teacher
could be more our speed.

276
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:27,687
Hey, buddy. Uh, we're new here.

277
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:30,733
And we were told to see a math teacher
specializing in calculus.

278
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:33,396
Professor Hahn handles
all remedial math.

279
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,727
That qualifies as remedial.

280
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,744
What's calculus? The one
with the blocks and the shapes?

281
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,588
- Do you know where we can find him?
- You can catch him at the end of the day.

282
00:14:40,606 --> 00:14:43,258
- He's in my carpool.
- Sweet! Gus, this school has a carpool.

283
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,191
- Answer to our prayers.
- Why?

284
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:47,600
Gus managed to get his car impounded.
He parked on a statue.

285
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:49,136
- I'm contesting the ticket.
- Here's the thing.

286
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:51,200
We had to take the bus
to school today.

287
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:54,800
I accidentally gave myself a wedgy.
Gus had to sit next to the girl who peed.

288
00:14:54,808 --> 00:14:56,700
Why are you telling me all of this?

289
00:14:57,436 --> 00:15:00,575
I thought it seemed obvious.
Can we get a lift home?

290
00:15:03,678 --> 00:15:08,626
So must be fun being a gym teacher.
You get to play sports all day.

291
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,200
I teach gym at a school
full of prodigy nerds.

292
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,653
I start off my day
by getting 300 notes

293
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:16,904
excusing kids from gym class
because of rickets or IBS.

294
00:15:16,923 --> 00:15:19,078
I tossed a ball at a student once.

295
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:22,967
He wet his pants. And his parents
filed a civil suit against me.

296
00:15:23,732 --> 00:15:26,682
Professor Hahn.
Hahn.

297
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:28,417
Math teacher, right?

298
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,064
Yes. Are you the new psychic lecturer?

299
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:38,737
That I am. I'm getting a feeling about
you. Are you a right said Fred fan?

300
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:41,248
- Are you too sexy for your shirt?
- Excuse me.

301
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:43,700
I'm sensing you're so sexy it hurts.

302
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:48,685
Oh. How'd you find that?

303
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:52,987
Hey, moron. Right up here.

304
00:15:53,022 --> 00:15:54,304
I'm sensing Riley
may have forgotten

305
00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:56,492
because you didn't use
the carpool last Friday.

306
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:00,908
Wow, that's right. I stayed late.
Okay, right here. Stop right here.

307
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,108
Deep voice.
Missed the carpool on Friday.

308
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:10,207
Sounds like our guy.
Now we've just gotta figure out

309
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:12,038
why and how he's gonna kill somebody.

310
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:17,187
And one more thing. If you are late
picking me up in the morning,

311
00:16:17,216 --> 00:16:18,962
I will tear your head off.

312
00:16:20,908 --> 00:16:22,665
Maybe just the how.

313
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:25,114
Are you prepared
for your psychic seminar?

314
00:16:25,135 --> 00:16:26,638
Gus, please.

315
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:30,918
Any leads? I'm adapting this
into a Nancy Drew fanfic.

316
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:33,304
I believe whoever's involved
is in the vicinity.

317
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,175
We made notes for you. Bullet
points you might wanna try to hit.

318
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,186
- Don't show any fear.
- Don't split any infinitives.

319
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:40,196
- Don't dangle your participles.
- At least not in public.

320
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:43,224
Look, if I understood
what you guys were saying,

321
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:47,290
I'd still be a virgin.
Now, run along. Go to class.

322
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,114
Really?

323
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:02,674
Hahn is here.

324
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:06,817
The seminar's open to both
students and teachers, Gus.

325
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:09,441
I personally extended Hahn
an invitation so I can grill him

326
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,507
in front of a live studio audience.

327
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:14,081
If he's killed before,
I'll get him to confess.

328
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:17,050
How're you gonna interrogate someone
and teach a class at the same time?

329
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,169
First the carrot, then the stick.

330
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:22,415
You don't even know
what that means, do you?

331
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:23,616
Leave me alone.

332
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:27,041
Phsysics.

333
00:17:27,074 --> 00:17:29,074
The physics of psychics.

334
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:30,781
I'm professor Shawn Spencer.

335
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:34,947
I will be your psychic ferryman
over the river Styx.

336
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,197
That's Gus. My ferry.

337
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:40,555
- Hello.
- Each one of us is born with a kernel

338
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,202
of what I like to dub
paranormalevolance.

339
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:47,494
I, however, was born
with an extra normal amount.

340
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:50,533
Two cops to be exact.
Allow me to demonstrate.

341
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:58,144
Congratulations on getting
your braces removed.

342
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:01,843
That doesn't mean you're psychic.
Maybe you're just hyper-observant.

343
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:08,442
You wear that white
sweatshirt everyday.

344
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:10,552
Shall I tell the class why?

345
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,298
You.

346
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:16,739
You, young man.

347
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:19,700
A little aloe will do wonders
for that combination skin.

348
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,222
And perhaps you should use
more care while shaving.

349
00:18:25,244 --> 00:18:28,437
Or, just wait until you can grow
facial hair altogether.

350
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:31,969
You could've just smelled
my aftershave on the way in.

351
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:34,921
How 'bout a real test?
I'll write the answer on the board.

352
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:38,402
And I'll tell you the question.
Have at it, young Trebek.

353
00:18:38,672 --> 00:18:41,246
- Trebek, I said.
- This is jeopardy!

354
00:18:41,268 --> 00:18:44,500
- Potent potables.
- Questions that start with p.

355
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:47,869
The smartass who thinks he's
gonna make me look silly.

356
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:49,600
Who is this guy?

357
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:05,488
Your negativity is really
impeding my psychic ability.

358
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,857
- Or you're just a big fraud.
- Go to the principal's office.

359
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:09,261
- Wait a sec.
- Get out of here, go.

360
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:12,266
Go. Go, get out of here.
Get out of here.

361
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,134
None of you should be friends
with him.

362
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,780
Psst. Hahn.

363
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,989
Professor Hahn.

364
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:24,055
I'm getting something from you.

365
00:19:24,077 --> 00:19:26,784
A kind of darkness. Yes.

366
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:28,284
I see you clearly.

367
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:30,224
With a target.

368
00:19:31,752 --> 00:19:33,763
I shop at Target.

369
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:36,393
Sure, but, but, I...

370
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,586
I see you on a cell phone
with your cousin.

371
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:42,566
Plotting, planning.
Something secret.

372
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:45,582
Yes.

373
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:49,914
Yes, I've been planning a...

374
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:55,972
Surprise party for my sister-in-law.
She's impossible to surprise.

375
00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:58,522
That's amazing.

376
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah, well, if she's gonna have
puppies, she's gonna have puppies.

377
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:09,418
There's nothing we can do about it.
Look, if you had her fixed like I...

378
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,619
- Do you need something?
- Yes, actually.

379
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:15,908
- Well?
- Well, what?

380
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,825
Well, order me off the phone.

381
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:18,306
You need me to work,
and I'm wasting time.

382
00:20:19,365 --> 00:20:20,780
That's a nice touch.

383
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,727
I've been reviewing
the statement we took

384
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:25,714
from the kids on campus.
They said whoever this teacher is,

385
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:28,233
he's already killed once,
and he's going to kill again.

386
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:29,069
- Right.
- Right.

387
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,017
It strikes me that it's difficult to solve
a crime that hasn't happened yet, so...

388
00:20:33,018 --> 00:20:35,381
why don't we focus our attention
on the murder that already has?

389
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:36,683
- Makes sense.
- Great.

390
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:39,980
These are the case files
for every unsolved homicide

391
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:42,292
in the Santa Barbara area
over the last five years.

392
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,962
Lot of paper cuts there.

393
00:20:44,364 --> 00:20:45,971
- Have fun.
- No...

394
00:20:45,972 --> 00:20:48,078
I need you to review these

395
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,106
and tell me if there are any
connections with the Meitner faculty.

396
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:53,538
Yeah...
I'm not gonna do that.

397
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:56,294
You delegate this background
stuff all the time.

398
00:20:56,295 --> 00:20:59,450
To me, usually. Almost always
when I have dinner plans.

399
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:00,958
Now...

400
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,973
Go through these with a fine-tooth comb
and tell me what you find.

401
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:07,121
- If it's not too much trouble.
- O'Hara, you are drunk with power.

402
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:08,762
I know! Isn't it great?

403
00:21:16,936 --> 00:21:20,495
And that amazing demonstration
is phsysics at work.

404
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:23,995
It's like thinking of a song, and then,
bam! It's the next tune on the radio.

405
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:27,362
Or... Or that moment when you
know it's right to kiss a girl.

406
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:29,606
That's when you use the power.

407
00:21:30,171 --> 00:21:31,473
Professor Hahn.

408
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:34,865
- I'm still sensing something from...
- Um, professor?

409
00:21:35,134 --> 00:21:36,315
Call me sensel.

410
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,777
- How can we harness...
- Uh, uh, uh. Sensei.

411
00:21:40,562 --> 00:21:41,751
- Sensel.
- Yes.

412
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:45,048
How can we harness this power
to help us um...

413
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:46,279
Kiss girls?

414
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,874
I'll take it from here, Shawn.

415
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:50,090
Oh, I don't know, Gus.

416
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:52,792
Now may not be the time to impede
their psycho-sexual development.

417
00:21:52,821 --> 00:21:55,368
Well, maybe you've forgotten
that I was the one who took

418
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:57,165
the hottest girl
in school to the prom.

419
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,616
That's because I told her
you were dying.

420
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:01,923
Otherwise, I would have had
to pay for the limo myself.

421
00:22:01,952 --> 00:22:03,339
Let me take this, please.

422
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:07,472
Gus, my ferry.

423
00:22:07,764 --> 00:22:09,780
Thank you, Shawn.

424
00:22:11,545 --> 00:22:16,032
Now, kissing someone for the first
time can be tricky business.

425
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:18,483
I like to employ the
Kadeem Hardison method.

426
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:19,842
When you're on a date...

427
00:22:19,969 --> 00:22:23,096
Uh, uh, I can sense a question
forming in all of your minds.

428
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,299
If it's "who is Kadeem Hardison?",

429
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,241
or "how do we ask someone on a date?"
put 'em down.

430
00:22:31,774 --> 00:22:33,852
Listen, it's not your fault.

431
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,851
Just look at this class.
You're all a bunch of dudes.

432
00:22:37,182 --> 00:22:39,248
Um, we're girls.

433
00:22:40,957 --> 00:22:42,131
That's awkward.

434
00:22:44,526 --> 00:22:47,187
I'll cover all the dating stuff
in my next seminar.

435
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:50,705
"Puberty : Monster or
misunderstood friend?"

436
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:54,300
That kid I sent to the office
had some weird zit cream on.

437
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:56,234
Professor Enrico.

438
00:23:00,531 --> 00:23:02,272
Guster. Burton Guster.

439
00:23:02,565 --> 00:23:03,952
You interviewed me for admission?

440
00:23:03,953 --> 00:23:06,548
- Math prodigy.
- I interview people all the time.

441
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:07,749
Was this recently?

442
00:23:07,806 --> 00:23:08,881
Semi-recent.

443
00:23:09,426 --> 00:23:10,558
20 years ago.

444
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:13,088
But I tap-danced
in trochaic tetrameter.

445
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:15,794
- Made you wanna cry.
- That rings a bell.

446
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,978
So... Visiting the old alma mater?

447
00:23:19,387 --> 00:23:22,203
- No, I went to public school.
- Really?

448
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:24,609
Could've sworn
I recommended admission.

449
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,352
Either way, I assume a person
with your skills ended up at JPL

450
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:30,403
or some kind of think tank?

451
00:23:31,183 --> 00:23:34,296
Actually, I ended up
in pharmaceuticals.

452
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:37,371
You know... Curing stuff.

453
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:41,408
Well, keep up the good work.

454
00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:43,117
Thank you.

455
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:47,158
Dude.
You didn't even mention Magic head.

456
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:49,426
Guys, we're freaking out.

457
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:51,408
We're pretty sure
professor Hahn is our guy.

458
00:23:51,457 --> 00:23:54,004
- So turn him in to the cops.
- Not without proof.

459
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,448
- Know anything about him?
- The only time we see him

460
00:23:56,449 --> 00:23:59,073
is when he gets his espresso
in the morning before homeroom.

461
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:01,387
- There's an espresso bar here on campus?
- Wait!

462
00:24:01,388 --> 00:24:03,850
Wasn't Hahn involved in that thing?
You remember that thing?

463
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:05,898
- The thing with the other thing?
- No, no. Just the first thing

464
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:08,385
from five years ago.
When the student attacked the professor?

465
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:09,942
Oh, yeah, that could've been Hahn.

466
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,707
Some student attacked Hahn and he made
sure the Headmaster expelled him.

467
00:24:13,763 --> 00:24:15,207
Who's the student that attacked him?

468
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:19,301
According to the school computers,

469
00:24:19,302 --> 00:24:22,909
the only kid to be expelled in the
last ten years was a Lester Baekeland.

470
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:30,190
What are you doing?

471
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:32,563
Getting the plague, apparently.

472
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:34,742
God.

473
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:39,652
Babcock, Babette,
Battra something...

474
00:24:39,653 --> 00:24:40,663
Baekeland.

475
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,446
God.

476
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,488
I can see why you wanted
to go here, Gus.

477
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:47,809
They keep meticulous records
of everything just like you.

478
00:24:48,334 --> 00:24:49,523
Expelled for cheating.

479
00:24:49,524 --> 00:24:51,348
Dude, there's a transcript
of his hearing.

480
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:53,070
- What does it say?
- The kid claimed

481
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:55,537
Hahn busted him for cheating...

482
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:59,791
Then tried to extort his scholarship
money from him to stay quiet.

483
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:01,589
Hahn denies it.

484
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:05,748
Headmaster, of course, sides
with the teacher. The kid gets expelled.

485
00:25:08,956 --> 00:25:11,050
That means Hahn is a blackmailer.

486
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,177
Maybe he threatened
the wrong person this time.

487
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:19,031
Gus?

488
00:25:20,743 --> 00:25:21,748
Gus.

489
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:23,728
I got in.

490
00:25:24,393 --> 00:25:28,276
I applied, and I got in.
That means a lot, buddy.

491
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,222
You'd rather stay with
your best friend than...

492
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:32,306
- You know, have a future.
- No, Shawn.

493
00:25:32,307 --> 00:25:34,773
It says, "parents of applicant
refused admission."

494
00:25:34,774 --> 00:25:37,363
if I'd known I'd gotten in,
I would've been ghost.

495
00:25:37,364 --> 00:25:39,873
This place has a direct line
to the ivy league.

496
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:42,675
- Why would my parents turn it down?
- I don't know...

497
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:45,661
- Maybe it was just too expensive.
- I could've gotten financial aid, Shawn.

498
00:25:45,662 --> 00:25:47,820
Half the kids here are
on scholarships with stipends.

499
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:50,721
Can we not obsess about this right now?
We do have a murder to prevent.

500
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:52,220
I'm not obsessing, Shawn.

501
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:55,192
I just found out that the course of my
life may have been changed by my parents.

502
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:57,632
- You've seen sliding doors.
- I most certainly have not.

503
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:00,307
- Yes, you did.
- Dude, I have not seen sliding doors.

504
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:02,748
It was me, you, and Missy Isaacs.
What are you talking about?

505
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:06,365
I'm talking about a Gwyneth Paltrow
vehicle that I know I never saw.

506
00:26:06,412 --> 00:26:09,467
Please.
I know you're home.

507
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,774
This is my fifth message.
Call me back.

508
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,506
They're just screening my calls
until I've let this go.

509
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,688
But it's not gonna happen.

510
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:18,359
Gus, let's face it.

511
00:26:18,756 --> 00:26:21,761
Your parents thought splitting us up
at a young age was a mistake.

512
00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:23,127
And I can't say I blame them.

513
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:25,973
For a while, I was your only
friend that wasn't imaginary

514
00:26:25,974 --> 00:26:27,505
or an action figure of some kind.

515
00:26:27,547 --> 00:26:30,517
Shawn, if anything, my parents
wanted me to stay in public school

516
00:26:30,518 --> 00:26:32,715
so that I would stand out
compared to people like you.

517
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,928
- Yeah. No holes in that theory.
- I don't know which is worse.

518
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,450
My parents dodging my calls,

519
00:26:37,451 --> 00:26:40,395
or you volunteering me to pick up
a murderer first thing in the morning.

520
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:43,257
Dude, it is your turn
to drive the carpool.

521
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:44,379
What's our plan?

522
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,753
Today is murder day.

523
00:26:46,343 --> 00:26:49,117
Speaking of murder day, is that
really what you're wearing?

524
00:26:50,012 --> 00:26:53,599
Shawn, in about two minutes, we're gonna
be in a confined space with a killer.

525
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,227
Please tell me
you have a good reason.

526
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,883
Of course I have
a good reason, Gus.

527
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,147
This time, it'll be just you,
me, and him,

528
00:26:59,148 --> 00:27:02,133
and I will totally break him down.

529
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,913
That's Hahn's house.

530
00:27:13,218 --> 00:27:14,223
Or...

531
00:27:15,114 --> 00:27:16,897
Maybe it'll just be you and me.

532
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:27,388
Well, according to our
arson investigator,

533
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:29,114
here is our murderer.

534
00:27:29,624 --> 00:27:32,100
Apparently, there was a slight
gas leak in the stove.

535
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:33,856
Overnight, the room fills
with natural gas,

536
00:27:33,857 --> 00:27:37,070
the coffee pot clicks on in the morning,
there's a spark, and ka-boom.

537
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:40,182
No, I'm sensing it was
definitely more of a ka-blam.

538
00:27:44,237 --> 00:27:46,713
- So you're saying this was an accident?
- Arson investigator says

539
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:48,397
there's no sign of foul play.

540
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,154
The only time we see him is
when he gets his espresso

541
00:27:51,155 --> 00:27:52,456
in the morning before homeroom.

542
00:27:52,944 --> 00:27:54,232
Wait, I'm having a vision.

543
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:58,012
Hahn preferred Italian coffee.
Espresso.

544
00:27:58,196 --> 00:27:59,823
Why would he be brewing coffee here

545
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:01,890
if he was gonna get his fix
in the morning at school?

546
00:28:02,074 --> 00:28:04,508
I'm sensing our killer brought
the coffee machine here

547
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:07,123
and used it as a detonator
after creating the gas leak.

548
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,437
What killer, Spencer?

549
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:10,842
- Our expert says it's an accident.
- I say murder.

550
00:28:10,843 --> 00:28:12,910
It's what drew me
to this wretched place.

551
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:14,679
Talk to the girl
who makes the espresso.

552
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,762
I usually don't do this, but I have
a strong sense she'll back this up.

553
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:21,450
Hahn had a cup
first thing every morning.

554
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:23,848
What do you call those coffee people?
They're not...

555
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:26,446
- Cashiers. They're not waitresses.
- Barista.

556
00:28:27,012 --> 00:28:30,139
Gus, if you don't know
the answer, don't make up words.

557
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:42,871
Dude, Hahn was broke.

558
00:28:42,872 --> 00:28:44,597
No wonder he's a blackmailer.

559
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:48,107
The due date for the payment is
the same as murder day. Coincidence?

560
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:49,302
I think not.

561
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:53,896
<i>It was staticky.</i>

562
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:56,692
But we heard a deep, gravelly
voice talking to their cousin.

563
00:28:57,074 --> 00:28:58,603
<i>Someone named Muriel.</i>

564
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:05,720
We are so on this case now.

565
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:10,225
It's your call, O'Hara.

566
00:29:10,324 --> 00:29:11,824
Either it's an accident
and we're done,

567
00:29:11,825 --> 00:29:14,229
or it's a homicide, and there's
a killer on the loose.

568
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,469
I don't buy this accident
angle for a second.

569
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,592
Those kids practically said
this would happen.

570
00:29:19,044 --> 00:29:20,969
Let's bring them back in
for questioning.

571
00:29:24,136 --> 00:29:28,367
If you confess now,
name your accomplices,

572
00:29:28,368 --> 00:29:31,569
I will let the D.A. know
that you cooperated and maybe,

573
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,715
just maybe, no guarantees.
Just maybe...

574
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:37,234
They'll cut you a break.

575
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:45,443
It's terrible.

576
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:48,016
- What?
- Am I scared?

577
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:50,908
Am I quaking?
No, that was what I call :

578
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:53,526
"lower case mad."
You need to be :

579
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:55,283
"upper case mad."

580
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,702
Those strange kids
are in interrogation B.

581
00:30:02,618 --> 00:30:04,500
Listen, O'Hara.

582
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:07,419
Given your slightly,
pedestrian performance

583
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,391
and the fact that this has
now jumped to a straight-up homicide

584
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:13,321
- maybe I should take over as lead.
- But, why? It's my case.

585
00:30:13,322 --> 00:30:16,272
Which was fine when it was just
kids telling tales, but

586
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:19,437
there are certain nuances involved
in a murder investigation which

587
00:30:19,438 --> 00:30:22,330
- require a more experienced touch.
- Nuances?

588
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:24,408
The chief says
I'll learn by being primary.

589
00:30:24,437 --> 00:30:26,531
- Yeah, but...
- But what?

590
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:27,989
There was an explosion.

591
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,031
I've never had a case
with an explosion before.

592
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:32,140
I've had assault and burglary cases.

593
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:35,466
Once I even had a murder by thermometer.
But I never had an explosion.

594
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:38,165
Come on, haven't you ever pictured
yourself trying to out run a fireball

595
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:39,425
down a dark tunnel?

596
00:30:39,808 --> 00:30:40,812
No.

597
00:30:45,952 --> 00:30:49,093
Obviously, due to recent events,
we are taking a closer look

598
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:53,091
at everything surrounding the school,
including the statement you gave to us.

599
00:30:53,128 --> 00:30:55,859
You mean when we predicted
someone was going to die today?

600
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,864
And they did?

601
00:30:56,911 --> 00:30:59,916
- Well, that. And...
- Watch your mouth, kid.

602
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:02,280
Okay, you're not fooling anybody.
We know what's going on here.

603
00:31:02,322 --> 00:31:05,365
What he means is...

604
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:07,666
Please tell us again about
the phone call you overheard.

605
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:10,790
No. Tell us about
your relationship with Hahn.

606
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:13,931
- You little son of a...
- Lassiter, stop. They're teenagers.

607
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:15,484
We're sorry.

608
00:31:15,586 --> 00:31:16,586
Lesson 63.

609
00:31:16,587 --> 00:31:18,780
- Do not apologize to the perp.
- They're not perps.

610
00:31:18,827 --> 00:31:21,138
- You don't know that.
- You two aren't really acquainted with

611
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:23,516
game theory or prisoner's
dilemma, are you?

612
00:31:24,057 --> 00:31:27,495
He means you two don't really
get the good cop bad cop dyad.

613
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,920
- Are you guys, like, together?
- No, she's way out of his league.

614
00:31:31,262 --> 00:31:34,475
But no ring. Given his age,
I'm guessing divorced.

615
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:37,878
- I... Wha... Sorry. What?
- Still can't talk about it.

616
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:39,760
So it's relatively recent then?

617
00:31:39,818 --> 00:31:41,728
I'm getting separated. Not divorced.

618
00:31:41,771 --> 00:31:43,749
Did you ever just listen
to her problems,

619
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,607
- rather than always trying to solve them?
- No, you had to be the big tough cop,

620
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:48,588
didn't you?
You never let her inside.

621
00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:53,094
See this, Brainiac?

622
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:55,829
This is what's waiting for you when
you turn 18. You're gonna graduate,

623
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,403
and get your diploma,
and then, bam!

624
00:31:58,404 --> 00:32:00,548
We're taking a trip down
to the docks.

625
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:04,601
That doesn't look very intimidating
with, uh, you know, the one arm.

626
00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:23,725
When did my house become
a daycare center?

627
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:26,243
Dad, you've been bugging me for
months to fix your computer.

628
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:27,998
I finally bring the
geek squad in to do it,

629
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:29,767
and now you're gonna give me
a hard time?

630
00:32:29,985 --> 00:32:31,145
Thank you.

631
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:34,570
Hahn had someone's juvenile record.

632
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:36,971
Maybe he dug up something
on our killer's past, which means

633
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:39,289
- we have to hack into the juvie database.
- Yeah, I'm with you

634
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,284
except for the part about
coming to my dad's house.

635
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:43,718
Well, according to the kids,
the hacking may come back to us.

636
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:46,050
Now the authorities will be led
to an antique computer

637
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:49,041
purchased by a former cop.
Can you say wild goose chase?

638
00:32:49,098 --> 00:32:51,218
Jeez, this computer is ancient.

639
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,190
I didn't realize Colecovision
was still in business.

640
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,268
All right, I'm in.

641
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:59,610
Muriel juvenile hall
slash halfway house.

642
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:00,774
What am I looking for?

643
00:33:00,844 --> 00:33:05,047
I'm sensing our investigation
centers on the year 1991.

644
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,478
'91?

645
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:08,544
There's nothing
but a bunch of photos here.

646
00:33:08,588 --> 00:33:09,861
Click on the top right.

647
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:16,185
That's that kid I sent
to the principal's office.

648
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,317
Kirk Godel.

649
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:20,830
Why the hell is a photo from today
mixed in with photos from '91?

650
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,288
It's not.

651
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:24,693
This photo was taken 15 years ago.

652
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:30,831
I'm having a vision.

653
00:33:31,255 --> 00:33:32,854
The man from Snowy River.

654
00:33:33,562 --> 00:33:34,864
Eddie Macon's run.

655
00:33:36,469 --> 00:33:37,516
Spartacus.

656
00:33:37,555 --> 00:33:38,899
- Kirk Douglas!
- Yes.

657
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,711
See if there's a student named Kirk.

658
00:33:40,804 --> 00:33:43,358
The registrar gave me access
to all their files.

659
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,065
It's perfectly normal, you know.

660
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:49,874
- What is?
- The anxiety of being in charge.

661
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,209
I can sense you have the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

662
00:33:52,704 --> 00:33:55,364
I just really wanna
get this right.

663
00:33:56,163 --> 00:33:57,777
Oh. I've got something.

664
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,744
Kirk Godel.

665
00:34:00,593 --> 00:34:01,696
Godel.

666
00:34:02,148 --> 00:34:05,068
It's almost pronounced like girdle
because of the omelet on the "o."

667
00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:08,368
- Pretty sure that's an umlaut.
- I've heard it both ways.

668
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:11,314
Let's see.
No juvenile record, only child.

669
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:14,476
All stats match up with his school
records. Nothing out of the ordinary.

670
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:18,340
- Let's see what Google says.
- Uh, search it with the word Muriel.

671
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:23,225
Oh, here's an article from
the Muriel County newsletter.

672
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:26,697
According to this article,
Kirk Godel and his parents

673
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:29,598
died five years ago in a car crash.

674
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,466
There should be a death certificate
on file, but there's no sign of it.

675
00:34:32,933 --> 00:34:34,745
What the hell is going on?

676
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,394
<i>A little aloe will do wonders
for that combination skin.</i>

677
00:34:41,026 --> 00:34:44,563
Circle your horses, Jules. We're about
to crack your case like an egg.

678
00:34:46,263 --> 00:34:50,325
And then, we'll make some umlauts.
With shallots.

679
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:52,625
And justice.

680
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,455
Please take your seats.

681
00:34:57,865 --> 00:35:01,386
Good, I'm glad you're all
on time for phsysics two.

682
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:02,873
The wrath of Khan.

683
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:06,524
Today's lecture will cover
come uppance.

684
00:35:06,753 --> 00:35:09,272
And how to solve a crime
in a crowded room.

685
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:13,277
Someone here
is living a lie.

686
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,476
Someone in this room
is a ghost-faced killah.

687
00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:23,141
It's not you.

688
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,084
But you have to do something
about the hair immediately.

689
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:27,528
Okay? I'd start now.

690
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,625
You.

691
00:35:30,644 --> 00:35:33,842
Your heart is pure.
I'd say lose the earring,

692
00:35:33,843 --> 00:35:35,540
but I actually think
he pulls it off.

693
00:35:38,564 --> 00:35:41,415
But you.
Y...

694
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:43,673
Why do they always run?

695
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,654
Don't they know
it makes them look guilty?

696
00:35:47,698 --> 00:35:49,000
You need this guy?

697
00:35:49,043 --> 00:35:50,925
Thank you,
Detective Lassiter.

698
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,212
Have a seat.

699
00:35:53,882 --> 00:35:56,384
- You mind telling us what we're doing here?
- Well,

700
00:35:56,385 --> 00:35:58,855
as the beautiful, industrious,

701
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,689
Detective O'Hara has already gathered...

702
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,660
You're not the real Kirk Godel, are you?

703
00:36:02,716 --> 00:36:04,613
Will the real Kirk Godel
please stand up?

704
00:36:04,641 --> 00:36:06,249
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

705
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,723
You stole the real Kirk Godel's identity
so that you could get into this school.

706
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:14,047
But there's more to this case
than stolen identity.

707
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:15,696
Yes...

708
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:19,913
I'm sensing a much darker,
diabolical past.

709
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:23,305
You did a stint in juvie
for causing someone's death.

710
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:26,291
15 years ago.

711
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,682
- What, are you, nuts? He's a kid.
- True.

712
00:36:28,725 --> 00:36:30,763
So how could
this be possible, class?

713
00:36:31,043 --> 00:36:32,557
Time travel.

714
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:34,306
He cryogenically froze himself

715
00:36:34,307 --> 00:36:36,104
- in order to travel to the future.
- No.

716
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:37,844
He's a clone of the original.

717
00:36:38,814 --> 00:36:41,101
You know what?
Just never mind, guys.

718
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:43,435
Save it for your online role playing.

719
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:54,371
He's wearing make-up.

720
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:55,928
- Is he gay?
- No.

721
00:36:57,003 --> 00:36:58,192
Well, maybe.

722
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:00,331
Look, I don't...
I don't know.

723
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:04,933
But the reason he's wearing make-up
is because he is actually 30,

724
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:07,776
- trying to pass for a teenager.
- 30?

725
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:12,651
- What kind of moisturizer do you use?
- Class, I would advise you take notes.

726
00:37:12,652 --> 00:37:14,179
There will be a test on this.

727
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:20,338
You were always the smartest
kid in your class,

728
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,871
but with juvie on your record,
you couldn't get into college.

729
00:37:23,377 --> 00:37:27,239
Then one day, you read a story about
a 15 year old from your hometown

730
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,023
who died in a fiery car crash.

731
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:32,062
And that was the real Kirk Godel.

732
00:37:32,555 --> 00:37:34,536
And you had a light bulb moment.

733
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:38,159
All your life, people thought
you were younger than you looked,

734
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,944
so you decided to
take advantage of that

735
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:43,909
and hit a huge re-set button
on your life.

736
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,353
You forged Kirk's documents.

737
00:37:46,354 --> 00:37:48,731
Then you went online and
deleted his death certificate.

738
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:51,348
A new identity plus your
natural intelligence

739
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:53,535
meant you were
a cinch to make Meitner.

740
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,948
Now you would graduate from one of
the best high schools in the country,

741
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:59,043
get a scholarship to the ivys,

742
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:01,293
and become a young captain
of industry.

743
00:38:01,294 --> 00:38:04,939
And it was all rolling along
beautifully until Hahn...

744
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,977
discovered your dirty little secret.

745
00:38:07,217 --> 00:38:09,629
He blackmailed you
for your scholarship stipend.

746
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:13,086
He needed money to make
a bank payment by Wednesday,

747
00:38:13,087 --> 00:38:14,785
money you weren't willing to pay.

748
00:38:14,786 --> 00:38:18,417
You were so distraught,
you called your cousin to vent.

749
00:38:18,785 --> 00:38:21,667
You decided that the only way
out was to kill Hahn,

750
00:38:21,668 --> 00:38:23,495
and make it look
like an accident.

751
00:38:25,924 --> 00:38:29,688
Finally, you hacked in and deleted

752
00:38:29,689 --> 00:38:32,394
all records that
you were ever in juvie.

753
00:38:32,804 --> 00:38:34,828
Brilliant until the end.

754
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,657
Well, until this...
Until this last part.

755
00:38:37,658 --> 00:38:38,973
When you got caught.

756
00:38:39,468 --> 00:38:41,265
On the wild line.

757
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:42,845
Like a salmon.

758
00:38:47,377 --> 00:38:48,452
Pencils down.

759
00:38:50,221 --> 00:38:51,226
Come on.

760
00:38:53,136 --> 00:38:54,466
Cuff him, O'Hara.

761
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:56,808
Here, use mine.

762
00:38:57,246 --> 00:38:58,251
You've earned it.

763
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,468
Anything else I need to learn?

764
00:39:01,765 --> 00:39:02,996
There's one last lesson.

765
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:06,492
Forget all the other lessons
and know that you're a good cop.

766
00:39:13,104 --> 00:39:14,874
You know I'm gonna need
those cuffs back, right?

767
00:39:15,922 --> 00:39:16,926
Good.

768
00:39:23,175 --> 00:39:24,958
- Martinsdale.
- Macendale.

769
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:26,953
Jay Macendale.

770
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,052
Once we had the name, it was
pretty easy to track the rest.

771
00:39:30,053 --> 00:39:32,335
When he was 15,
he stole a car on a dare,

772
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:35,113
accidentally killed a pedestrian.
And that's what got him in juvie.

773
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:38,029
I can't believe he passed himself off
as a teenager for this long.

774
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:40,304
I don't know, dad.
Slap a wig on you,

775
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:42,838
you're the spitting image of
yourself when I was a kid.

776
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:44,893
What is that supposed to mean?

777
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:46,407
What's his problem?

778
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:49,534
- He finally got a hold of his parents.
- Don't tell me it was too expensive.

779
00:39:49,535 --> 00:39:52,174
My file said I qualified
for financial aid.

780
00:39:52,175 --> 00:39:53,518
Quality of life?

781
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,867
They have 24-7 slushy machines there.

782
00:39:55,873 --> 00:39:58,434
The lockers are made with teak.
That's the strongest wood.

783
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:01,523
These pieces look like they're hand-carved,
Shawn. What's with the generosity?

784
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:05,183
I saw you were still using the ratty
board with the plastic pieces

785
00:40:05,184 --> 00:40:08,028
so I went ahead
and shoplifted this for you.

786
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,597
I'm kidding. I bought it.

787
00:40:10,598 --> 00:40:13,229
Those kid geniuses turned me
on to a great IPO.

788
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,431
Now, remember, I win,
I get the truck for a week.

789
00:40:16,502 --> 00:40:20,241
All right, how 'bout, I win,
you wash the truck for a week?

790
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,307
Yeah, I really don't understand
what that means.

791
00:40:22,308 --> 00:40:23,656
I'm out there in a pair of jean shorts...

792
00:40:23,657 --> 00:40:26,260
- Continuously washing the vehicle for a...
- Shawn... Focus...

793
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:27,264
Focus.

794
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:29,241
Too far to drive?

795
00:40:29,242 --> 00:40:32,269
You derailed my future
because dad hates curvy roads?

796
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,406
I could've been
the next Wittgenstein.

797
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:37,263
I never got carsick a day in my life.

798
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:40,334
Gus doesn't deal
very well with surprises.

799
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:41,638
I'll talk to you later, Mom!

800
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:44,744
You never told him I was the one
who ran over his dog, did you?

801
00:40:44,768 --> 00:40:45,829
Dad, no.

802
00:40:46,475 --> 00:40:47,791
One thing at a time.

803
00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:50,961
Thank god that dog was 17.

804
00:40:53,314 --> 00:40:54,333
Checkmate.
