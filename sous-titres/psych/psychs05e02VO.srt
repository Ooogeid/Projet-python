1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,920
What are you doing?

2
00:00:06,418 --> 00:00:07,668
Just playin'...

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,159
Board grass.

4
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:14,717
Let me see what's behind your back.

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,851
Tap shoes?
Are you kidding me?

6
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:22,938
I like tap dancing.
In fact, I'm pretty good at it.

7
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,775
When people pick on me,
I just pull out that tap board

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,128
and show 'em who's bad.

9
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:30,071
All your permanent teeth are in.
You're playing for keeps now.

10
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:33,866
You should try it.
It's cool.

11
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,750


12
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,099
- All right, what have we got?
- Female victim.

13
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,685
Looks like she was trapped
inside her vehicle and drowned.

14
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:02,347
Must have been horrible.

15
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:05,731
O'Hara, maybe I should handle this one.
Until you get your sea legs back.

16
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,483
I am fine. I want to help.

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,750
Take notes.

18
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,640
Tall coffee, black.
I'm off the cream and sugar.

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,525
I'm sorry, O'Hara.
I'm pulling rank on this one.

20
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,619
There will be plenty of other females
who die horrific deaths,

21
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,329
and you can investigate
all of them when you're ready.

22
00:01:21,454 --> 00:01:23,093
Get yourself something too.

23
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,670
I'll get the next one!
Hope she doesn't remember that.

24
00:01:29,954 --> 00:01:34,050
I'm still covering a butt-load of cases
I took on while O'Hara was on vacation.

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,761
She was on stress leave.

26
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:37,830
Tomato, tomahto.

27
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:41,183
Until she's ready for duty again,
I need an extra set of hands.

28
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,708
- So pad up.
- Copy.

29
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,605
Keep your pie hole shut
until I assess my crime scene.

30
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:48,774
Nothing shuts my pie hole but pie.

31
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:54,836
Come on.

32
00:01:56,462 --> 00:01:58,960
We're gonna have to get close enough
to that body to get a reading.

33
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,461
Why do you need to get
a reading off a soggy corpse?

34
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:03,399
Why can't you just
point at it from here?

35
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:07,042
Or touch the car instead?
Why don't you read off of that bird?

36
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:10,452
This vehicle matches the description
of the one our missing person

37
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:11,630
was last seen in.

38
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:13,715
- Copy.
- Stop saying copy.

39
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
Roger.

40
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:20,541
Victim is identified as...

41
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:22,808
Desiree Blake.

42
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:26,029
Rained last night, right?

43
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:28,992
She took this curb too fast,
lost control,

44
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:30,946
went down the embankment,
drowned in the car.

45
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:33,762
Put time of death as sometime
yesterday on the 12th.

46
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:43,671
She wasn't in the car alone.
We're on.

47
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,788
I'm afraid we don't have
an accidental drowning here.

48
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:51,629
Our Desiree Blake was murdered.

49
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:53,923
You are so predictable.

50
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:56,538
As predictable as your next date
ending with the words,

51
00:02:56,663 --> 00:02:59,220
"I hope this never happens
to someone else"?

52
00:03:00,537 --> 00:03:01,722
Stop wasting my time.

53
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:04,163
You want in.
You make your case to your father

54
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:06,769
who's done nothing but say no to you
ever since he is here...

55
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:08,513
Thank God.

56
00:03:10,254 --> 00:03:14,079
I'd be lying if I said I like having
to ask my dad for case assignments.

57
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:17,604
I'd also be lying if I said
Val Kilmer still looks like Val Kilmer.

58
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:19,564
- I still have hope.
- Me too.

59
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,357
We gotta convince Lassie
to put us on this case.

60
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:24,419
You have to do that.
I don't have time.

61
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,574
My new tap class
starts in half an hour.

62
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:29,066
You're really taking... tap?

63
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:31,544
That wasn't just a bit
we were doing?

64
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,021
I'm doing something for myself,
getting back to things I love.

65
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:36,866
For a brief period in '93,
I was known

66
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,422
as DJ Cold Cuts.

67
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:41,048
Now, do you see me
dusting off my turntables

68
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:42,887
and playing the curves downtown?

69
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,515
The curves burnt down last year.

70
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,246
- No wonder they won't return my calls.
- I'll see you after class.

71
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:52,761
May I have a word?

72
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:56,193
Am I to understand
you're taking a... tap class?

73
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,489
Is it court-ordered?

74
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,928
Will it make you faster?

75
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:03,576
Are you investigating
some sort of dancing drug ring?

76
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:06,745
Then, why on earth
would a grown man do such a thing?

77
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:09,382
Look, it's something
I've been doing since I was a child,

78
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:12,626
and I don't care whether
you or Shawn don't get it.

79
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,996
All right, let's try that
one more time.

80
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:36,151
Some of your timing
was a little off.

81
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:41,335
Not necessary, Mr. Guster.
I can see everyone in the mirror.

82
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,657
- Nice moves, by the way.
- Thanks, I been tapping since...

83
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
Excuse me.

84
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:54,502
Let me guess. They wanna move me
to the advanced class?

85
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,266
There's a coworker
waiting for you in the hall.

86
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,998
I'm so sorry about this.

87
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,638
What are you doin' here?
I thought you were working on your case.

88
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,976
I gotta wait for
the science monkeys in forensics

89
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,350
to analyze the evidence
from the scene first.

90
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:17,248
I know this is a little weird,
I can't believe I'm here myself but...

91
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:20,361
Long story short,
ever since the divorce,

92
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:24,508
my therapist has advised me
to step out of my comfort zone

93
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:25,831
and try new things...

94
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:28,323
And since I don't like books
that aren't about military strategy

95
00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:30,213
nor do I care
for the company of women,

96
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:32,706
I thought I'd see if you can
get me into your little class here.

97
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:34,595
If you're doing it,
how hard could it be.

98
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,670
You realize you're insulting me
and asking me for a favor.

99
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:40,768
Give me a break. My insurance
only covered four therapy sessions.

100
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:43,543
The kind of tap that I do
is not something you can just jump into

101
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:44,718
without experience.

102
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,951
I'll have them send over the transcripts
from walking and chewing gum school.

103
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:50,391
Can you get me in the class or not?
I don't have much time.

104
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:54,019
- I'll see what I can do.
- You're a peach.

105
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,503
Cramp! Got a cramp!

106
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,297
All right, hold on.

107
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:24,825
You were...

108
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:29,680
It's a wrap for today, everyone.

109
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,032
Great work.
Remember... Keep it in the pocket.

110
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,685
I'll see you all next time,
all right?

111
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:37,714
It's great.

112
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:40,714
You okay?

113
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:42,953
This is... awesome.
I'm fine.

114
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:46,030
Don't worry about it. Everyone has
a hard time the first time around.

115
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:48,424
It wasn't hard.
It was just a waste of time.

116
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:50,409
I hope my therapist
doesn't make me come back.

117
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,220
- Wait... you're quitting?
- No, I'm not quitting.

118
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:56,498
- I'm simply choosing not to continue.
- Realize how hard it was.

119
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:58,404
I didn't want to make you quit.

120
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:00,760
Especially because I believe
that people who carry guns

121
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:02,907
should do what their therapists say.

122
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:05,585
Let's try it again.
Come on.

123
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:08,847
- It's ridiculous.
- It'll be something simple.

124
00:07:08,972 --> 00:07:11,307
All right, let's try a cramp roll.

125
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:12,723
Ready?

126
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,573
- That's it?
- That's it.

127
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:21,976
- Just like that.
- Really?

128
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:31,693
I'm actually starting to get it.

129
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:35,473
There might be something
to this pansy stuff after all.

130
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:37,290
I don't know if pansy's
the right word.

131
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,826
The alternative seemed a little offense,
so I thought I'd water it down.

132
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:42,975
I gotta tell ya...

133
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:46,435
I'm actually starting
to feel a little more relaxed.

134
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:49,977
Let's try something different.
Let's try a shuffle.

135
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,637
Ready?

136
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:56,045
Just like that!

137
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,898
You know, it's like...
focusing on the step,

138
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:06,297
it's actually helping me
clear my mind.

139
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:07,194
Exactly.

140
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:10,071
This is the clearest
my mind's been in years.

141
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:13,032
I actually feel the stress
just melting away.

142
00:08:13,613 --> 00:08:15,913
All right, try this one now.
Ready?

143
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:27,556
So what are you stressed about?

144
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:28,755
Work.

145
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:31,218
The neighbor's suing me
for killing his squirrels.

146
00:08:31,882 --> 00:08:32,982
Mostly work.

147
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:37,015
You know that case
you guys walked in on earlier?

148
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:40,695
Something about it
just doesn't add up.

149
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,055
Found this bag
of unmarked pills in her purse.

150
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,564
- Crap!
- What?

151
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:46,859
While I'm sitting here
fooling around with you,

152
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,153
I forgot to call the lab
about the results.

153
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:52,861
It's Lassiter. Did you analyze
that sample I brought in yet?

154
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:55,242
Are you kidding me?
How long does it take?

155
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,581
I thought maybe you could
tell me something,

156
00:08:57,706 --> 00:08:59,765
like what they are,
where she bought 'em, anything.

157
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,952
Those pills weren't bought.
They were made.

158
00:09:02,077 --> 00:09:04,084
- They're lab trial samples.
- How do you know?

159
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,629
- I'm in pharmaceutical sales, remember?
- Since when?

160
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,953
Doesn't matter.
Can you tell me who made these?

161
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:13,635
There's only a handful of local labs
that use that pentagonal shape.

162
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:15,014
Really?

163
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,540
Gus, are you busy right now?

164
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,944
There you are.
Your class let out just in time.

165
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:25,950
KFC is giving away double downs.

166
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,944
They're just giving them away.

167
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:32,630
- What are you doing here?
- I discovered,

168
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:35,449
after you two left the crime scene,
that I have a need for Guster's...

169
00:09:36,463 --> 00:09:39,453
Pharmaceutical expertise on this case,
so I came here to find him.

170
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,164
You convinced Lassie
to put us on the case. Good work, buddy!

171
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:43,790
I said Guster's expertise.

172
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:46,590
- Not yours.
- Yeah, we're a package, Lassie.

173
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:49,671
You don't get Jake "the snake" Roberts
without Damien the python.

174
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,466
- Gus doesn't work solo. Tell him.
- That's not actually true...

175
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,525
You have offended him
by merely suggesting it.

176
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,011
- Don't be angry.
- I'm not.

177
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:58,472
Now he's indignant!
You'd better back off, Jack.

178
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,425
Without breathing fire

179
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,518
through your sweet nostrils,
tell him to back off.

180
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,147
I don't have time. If you decide
you wanna help on the case alone,

181
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,078
you're welcome to come with me.

182
00:10:10,707 --> 00:10:13,320
- Why aren't you laughing?
- I'd only be helping. It's no big deal.

183
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,969
No big deal?
You'd be working a case without me.

184
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:19,154
- You've worked cases without me.
- Because I knew I could solve them.

185
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,532
Are you saying
I can't solve a case without you?

186
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:22,501
No.

187
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:24,702
Because if we've learned
anything over these few years

188
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:26,911
it's that you really can't
do it without me.

189
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:30,534
First of all... We haven't learned
anything over the years.

190
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:32,571
Second of all,
I'm the one with this.

191
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:34,773
- So?
- So, all you have is this...

192
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:40,034
You know what?
It's on.

193
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,287
- It's not on.
- It is on, Shawn.

194
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:44,601
Like mascara on Prince, it is on.

195
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:46,969
Lassie, count me in.
It's on.

196
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,027
- I'm thrilled. Get in the car.
- You know who has shotgun?

197
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:51,024
- You.
- Me.

198
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:53,986
- Lassie's already behind the wheel.
- Because it's on.

199
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:57,281
All right, fine. If this is
how you wanna play it, it is on.

200
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:59,950
I decide
when it switches from off to on.

201
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,719
- So it's off?
- Yes.

202
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,440
Now it's on!

203
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,928
502
"Feet Dont Kill Me Now"

204
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,496
Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

205
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,860
I'm Detective Carlton Lassiter.
This is my associate Burton Guster.

206
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:19,747
What's wrong?

207
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,990
I'm not used to getting
introduced by my real name.

208
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,452
Ma'am, are you familiar
with these pills?

209
00:12:28,686 --> 00:12:31,436
Those look like our trial
HCG hormone pills.

210
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:33,085
A fertility drug.

211
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,878
You are correct.

212
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,501
- Very nice, Guster.
- Thank you.

213
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:40,050
They're an experimental
fertility treatment

214
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,457
currently in phase three
of clinical trials.

215
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:44,179
They're not for public use.

216
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,371
Any idea how someone else could have
gotten ahold of those?

217
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:49,816
- Not a clue.
- Unless they were a test subject.

218
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:52,028
True. But I ran the trials alone

219
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:54,565
and kept all of the test
subject logs to myself.

220
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,393
Ma'am, those pills were found
on a dead woman.

221
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:00,278
So we're gonna need to see
those logs immediately.

222
00:13:01,717 --> 00:13:02,717
Of course.

223
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:06,409
You scared the crap outta her!

224
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:09,413
But a phase three trial
is a double blind trial,

225
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,109
meaning there has to be
at least two administrators.

226
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:15,738
The test group can have a different
administrator than the placebo group.

227
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:18,338
- So you're saying she lied?
- There has to be another technician.

228
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:21,324
Nice insight, Guster.

229
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:23,449
Why didn't you say something
when she was here?

230
00:13:23,574 --> 00:13:25,804
You know Shawn.
I usually can't get a word in edgewise.

231
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:27,388
That's funny.

232
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:29,699
O'Hara usually just
blurts out her opinions.

233
00:13:29,824 --> 00:13:31,601
As if I asked for them.
Or wanted them.

234
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:34,729
Or needed them.
Because women ruin everything.

235
00:13:36,177 --> 00:13:38,066
Maybe now's a good time
to call your therapist.

236
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:42,699
No, let's check out those logs first.
I'm gonna see where she went.

237
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:46,867
Look, Gus.
I'm getting handsy.

238
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,997
How's your little murder
investigation coming along?

239
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:53,331
Why are you here?

240
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:56,209
You missing a murder weapon?
You can take the knife out of my back.

241
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,627
How did you find me?

242
00:13:57,894 --> 00:14:00,254
I installed GPS
parental controls on your phone.

243
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,020
- Is that why it keeps beeping?
- It tells me if you use your card

244
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,209
to buy condoms, liquor, or glue.

245
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:08,022
It's a little wasteful,
don't you think?

246
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,209
- I'm a player, Shawn.
- You're not a playah.

247
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,976
What are you doing here, Spencer?
We already interviewed the technician.

248
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:16,023
If Gus is allowed
to show off his expertise,

249
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:17,899
then I'm allowed to show off mine.

250
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,274
We don't have time to watch you make
a snowman out of mashed potatoes.

251
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,416
That's funny.

252
00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:30,785
I'm getting something.
There's someone else...

253
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,412
Someone el... writing...

254
00:14:32,677 --> 00:14:34,223
With their right hand, right-handed.

255
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:36,166
Yes. She had a partner.
We already know that.

256
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:37,876
- You do?
- Yes. We do.

257
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,217
Now, if you'll excuse us.
Guster...

258
00:14:40,342 --> 00:14:42,463
Good luck getting hired
on a case that I'm already on.

259
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:45,359
Good luck getting hired
on my case that you're not on.

260
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,968
That doesn't make any sense.

261
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:51,156
Dad, I know
exactly what you're gonna say.

262
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:53,649
Yes. You can work on the case
with Lassiter and Gus.

263
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:56,785
- I had no idea you were gonna say that.
- Lassiter only requested Gus,

264
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,658
we still have to pay psych
your full rate.

265
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:01,180
I don't like the idea of you
sitting around on your ass all day

266
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:03,426
collecting a check
for doing nothing.

267
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:05,070
I'm putting you to work.

268
00:15:05,598 --> 00:15:09,097
So even when you do something I want,
it still counts as some punishment?

269
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:11,662
You're welcome...
Now I need to find you a partner.

270
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,287
I'll do it.
What case are we talking about?

271
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:15,924
The one Lassie's working with Gus.

272
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,667
Even better. He's been treating me
like a rookie ever since I took leave.

273
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,706
I am itching to get
back out into the field,

274
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,130
even if it means babysitting Shawn.

275
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,903
Fine. You two are working
the case together.

276
00:15:26,602 --> 00:15:29,135
No reason for anything
to fall through the cracks.

277
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,543
- Babysit? Really? Come on.
- Shawn, what have you done today?

278
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,894
Let's see.
I watched some <i>Phineas and Ferb</i>.

279
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,647
Took a nap. Had a snack.
I'm a little tired.

280
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,066
- Exactly.
- I just wanna beat Lassie and Gus.

281
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:47,070
- And... catch the killer.
- Sure, if that's what it takes.

282
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:49,614
As long as we get to do
our thing, chop it up,

283
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,184
pound the pavement,
walk the bzzz-neat.

284
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:54,244
Catch me up
on what we're dealing with.

285
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,898
I really am exhausted.

286
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:01,459
I'm having a vision that the technician
lied about not having another partner.

287
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:04,087
Then, let's call her in
and see what she's hiding.

288
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:06,413
Sorry.

289
00:16:11,894 --> 00:16:14,431
- What are you two doing here?
- We're interviewing a witness.

290
00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:16,808
- And you?
- We're interviewing a witness.

291
00:16:17,105 --> 00:16:18,729
Are you two working together now?

292
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,895
What happened,
they bust you down to the minors?

293
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,578
You go where you're appreciated.

294
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,319
I got two different calls
asking me to come in for questioning.

295
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:30,356
- Who called you first, us or them?
- Who'd you meet first, us or them?

296
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:31,846
Would you two stop it?

297
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,075
We have reason to believe
you lied to us

298
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,994
when you told us
that you worked alone.

299
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,330
Which, if true,
could land you an obstruction charge.

300
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:44,063
I'm sorry.

301
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:46,963
I was trying to protect
my partner Ben.

302
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:48,899
Protect him from what?

303
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:53,219
Desiree was Ben's girlfriend.

304
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:56,237
He was supplying her
with fertility pills under the table

305
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:59,684
because their insurance wouldn't cover
the thousands of dollars in treatments.

306
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,165
Wait. They were trying
to have a baby?

307
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,022
But they weren't even married.

308
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,274
- Get with the times. It's 2008!
- It's 2010.

309
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,777
Nice try. That would mean we're at war
with the machines.

310
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,304
- How much did you know about this Ben?
- Ben Stephens.

311
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,866
He's not a lawbreaker.
He's a very decent guy.

312
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:21,206
He was only trying
to be a good boyfriend.

313
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,369
I lied to keep him out of trouble,
but I certainly don't think he's capable

314
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:26,920
- of something like this.
- Neither do we.

315
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:30,664
Guster, would you care
to get a cup of coffee,

316
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:33,259
- maybe take a little break?
- Sure thing.

317
00:17:35,246 --> 00:17:37,046
Aren't we due for a break?

318
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,766
How would you feel about
a little heavy petting?

319
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,872
Just a little over the clothes
third base action?

320
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:44,938
- Maybe get some coffee?
- Sure.

321
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,287
What are you doing?

322
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,665
- Me? What are you doing?
- You pinned me in!

323
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,209
- This is my and Guster's lead.
- No, it's my and Shawn's lead.

324
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,316
- You should leave.
- What are you smoking?

325
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:10,692
I am head Detective.
All leads go through me.

326
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:13,591
Right. Like I haven't heard
that one before. I know your tricks.

327
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,101
O'Hara, I am ordering you
to get back in that vehicle

328
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:19,028
- and drive away.
- That's gonna be tricky, Lassie.

329
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:20,631
Give me those!

330
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:23,017
- Nice senior officiating there.
- Shut it!

331
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:34,279
You are letting your lead get away.

332
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,657
You just let your lead
slip through your fingers.

333
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:48,168
Will someone explain to me
how the four of you let him get away?

334
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:50,307
Someone else.

335
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:53,673
We were about
to question the suspect

336
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,800
when we got sidetracked
by a disagreement.

337
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,119
Disagreement.

338
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:01,264
Your little disagreement
has led to a state-wide manhunt.

339
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,286
He likes to use
your own words against you.

340
00:19:03,411 --> 00:19:04,934
This reflects poorly on me too,

341
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,228
I'd like to keep my job.

342
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:10,648
Now, I want the four of you
to get your acts together and find him!

343
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,735
You can't yell at me.
You're just a consultant.

344
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:16,851
I know what happened
to your neighbor's squirrels.

345
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:18,740
Carry on.

346
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,752
I take my job very seriously, Guster,
and I don't like being reprimanded.

347
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,479
All right, we've gotta figure out
where Ben fled to.

348
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,606
All we have to go on
is that he was last spotted

349
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:35,380
heading west on highway 101.

350
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:38,218
- What are you doing?
- It helped you last time.

351
00:19:38,607 --> 00:19:41,194
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Just follow my lead.

352
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:47,671
Did you notice anything
when we were at Ben's house?

353
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,173
It all happened too fast.

354
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:52,234
First thing I know, we were arguing,

355
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,005
next thing I know,
he was crashing through the garage.

356
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:58,279
The DMV report
that came out today...

357
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,032
It said that the car that Desiree's body
was found in belonged to Ben.

358
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:02,611
Right. They shared it.

359
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:05,300
They were living in sin
and driving in sin.

360
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:07,865
So whose car did Ben
crash through the garage in?

361
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,146
Good question.

362
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:12,717
Maybe a loaner?

363
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:16,490
A rental.

364
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,054
We should have McNab check
all the local rental companies.

365
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:20,179
Nice!

366
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:24,744
I gotta tell you, I can't believe
this stuff actually works!

367
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:27,405
Even though I look like
a total moron doing it.

368
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,591
Crap.

369
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,570
Look at that.
Christmas came early.

370
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,286
So that's what the two of you
have been doing together...

371
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,541
- Tap dancing?
- Okay, the truth is...

372
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:51,416
Lassiter happens to be
in my tap class.

373
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,216
You've been taking
tap classes together!

374
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:57,440
How sweet! What's next,
singing into hair brushes?

375
00:20:57,607 --> 00:20:59,259
Beachside pilates?

376
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,972
Quick, Jules, chime in
while I think of more zingers.

377
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:05,055
- What's next... bridge?
- Yeah, bridge... what?

378
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,307
Thanks for killing the bit.

379
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,203
Tapis something we both enjoy.

380
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,187
While you two are sneaking
around and spying on people,

381
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,772
we have a new lead.

382
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,692
You finishing each other's sentences?
But we have a lead too.

383
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,950
- Well, ours is more of a hunch...
- Hamburger!

384
00:21:20,117 --> 00:21:23,615
Shawn, why in the world would I have
been about to say hamburger?

385
00:21:23,894 --> 00:21:25,344
Let's roll, Guster.

386
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,956
- That doesn't even make any sense.
- I just heard you make an "h" sound.

387
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:32,666
So you go to hamburger?

388
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,978
We have to figure out
how Ben is involved,

389
00:21:41,145 --> 00:21:43,995
but I don't think they're going
to be cooperative, without a warrant.

390
00:21:44,162 --> 00:21:46,762
Jules, don't be Canada.
I'll handle this.

391
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:51,059
- Hello. How can I help you?
- I want to sell my body to science.

392
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:55,564
- Well, I'd like to make the first bid.
- Is this a... Silent auction?

393
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:58,009
What? She started it.

394
00:21:58,176 --> 00:22:02,180
We would like to sign up
to be human Guinea pigs for money.

395
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,948
Our study pays 20 bucks.

396
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,576
- I'll do it.
- Uh, sorry. Women only.

397
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,077
- She'll do it.
- What?

398
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,039
Don't act like you can't use 20 bucks.
I've seen your place.

399
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,648
If you're interested,
go sign the consent forms.

400
00:22:14,815 --> 00:22:18,431
You'll be put under anesthesia, and
the hormones may make your feet grow.

401
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:19,948
She's interested.

402
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,562
What's up?

403
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:26,219
What is anyone doing
in the grand scheme of things?

404
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,050
Your negativity is...

405
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:30,637
is clogging up my psychic signals.

406
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:32,351
Do you mind keeping her busy

407
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,320
- while I attempt to unclog them?
- how am I supposed to do that?

408
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,730
Gus would turn into smooth
Gus and try to pick her up.

409
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:40,386
- I'm not hitting on a girl.
- Does that scare you?

410
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:42,945
Or does that not scare you?
And does that scare you?

411
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:45,638
- What?
- Tthis girl could be dangerous.

412
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:47,658
make sure of that before you enter

413
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,226
into a relationship with her,
'cause she probably won't change.

414
00:22:51,961 --> 00:22:53,211
Right this way.

415
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:59,332
- I'll be back to get your information.
- I'll be right here.

416
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,704
All right, put the time of death down
yesterday on the 12th.

417
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,543
I turns out I am taking
all of the medications

418
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,972
that Tonya here says disqualifies
somebody from being a part of the study.

419
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,348
That's... no.

420
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:54,991
A bummer.

421
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,561
Oh, well. We tried.
I guess we should roll?

422
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:00,355
And if they ever
discover a drug here

423
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,461
that makes me as strong as an ox...

424
00:24:02,628 --> 00:24:05,277
But only when I'm fighting another ox...
You let me know.

425
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,362
- I will.
- All right.

426
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:16,992
- We are gonna nail this guy, Guster.
- Are you sure Ben's guilty?

427
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,159
100%.

428
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,085
Okay, here's the rental agreement.

429
00:24:22,358 --> 00:24:26,362
\Mr. Stephens' car was due back
yesterday. Do you think he stole it?

430
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:29,175
Your chances of seeing that vehicle
again are about as good

431
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:33,138
as your chances of turning this job
into a viable career.

432
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:35,587
Hey, this antitheft tracking device.

433
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:37,350
- That a lojack?
- Yeah.

434
00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:41,385
We're gonna need that tracking I.D.

435
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,341
We've got clear motive.
They've been together for a while.

436
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:48,510
She's been pressuring him,
putting the squeeze on him to have kids.

437
00:24:48,677 --> 00:24:49,946
They're maried.

438
00:24:50,196 --> 00:24:52,741
She'd get half of everything
if he left her. So he killed her.

439
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,660
I don't know. Who helps his
girlfriend obtain fertility pills If

440
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,204
he don't want to with her?

441
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,831
- This doesn't feel like murder.
- Guster, grow up.

442
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:02,251
People have sex,
and kill each other.

443
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,045
That's the real world.
Not some magical feelings place.

444
00:25:06,174 --> 00:25:07,688
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

445
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:10,863
- Let's go get a warrant.
- We're gonna eat first, right?

446
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,637
- We'll eat on the way.
- I got sunflower seeds.

447
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,487
We're so sorry
for your loss, miss Blake.

448
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:20,297
This must be very difficult for you,
so we won't take up a lot of your time.

449
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:24,468
I wish I could help, but I don't know
where he is. If I knew, I would tell.

450
00:25:25,683 --> 00:25:27,818
Was there animosity
between the two of you?

451
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,946
He was a cheating bastard.
Desiree found out,

452
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:34,282
and they had this huge fight
right before she disappeared.

453
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:37,350
What she did to make him cheat.

454
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:38,867
- Shawn.
- What?

455
00:25:39,317 --> 00:25:41,873
- What are you doing?
- You will thank me later.

456
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:44,671
Mrs. Blake...

457
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,240
I'm sensing that Ben felt
great remorse for his actions,

458
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,758
tried to reach out
to you personally.

459
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:55,804
The flowers he kept sending? Too little
too late. I never trusted that man.

460
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,933
- When did you last see Ben?
- Right after they found Desiree's body.

461
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,144
He came by to offer condolences.

462
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:04,359
I... promptly kicked him out.

463
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:07,649
I'm not so sure he's not
the reason she's dead.

464
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:12,487
Well... we have taken up
enough of your time, miss Blake.

465
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:15,152
- Thank you.
- We're just gonna...

466
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:18,571
- Shawn!
- Let's go.

467
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,326
Ben's looking more and more guilty
the more we learn about him.

468
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:24,563
I don't know.

469
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:28,734
Who kills someone's daughter
and then sends her flowers the next day?

470
00:26:29,032 --> 00:26:30,297
A crafty killer.

471
00:26:30,977 --> 00:26:33,528
Back to the station
and start putting pieces together.

472
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:35,900
Back to the station? Can't we
do this over a jamba juice?

473
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:39,757
My graph paper and colored pencils are
at the station to chart what we know

474
00:26:39,924 --> 00:26:41,814
- and extrapolate.
- What was that word?

475
00:26:41,981 --> 00:26:43,935
- Extrapolate.
- Doesn't sound very fun.

476
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:47,814
- Who said work was supposed to be fun?
- Ron Jeremy, for starters.

477
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,026
You go back to the office
and put all that boring stuff together

478
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,571
that... I already forgot what it was,
and I'll see you there in half an hour.

479
00:26:54,853 --> 00:26:56,364
Okay.
Half an hour.

480
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,490
Sweet.

481
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:09,356
Good work, Gus.
You found Ben.

482
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,995
Shawn, what are you doing here?

483
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,969
Dude, I know you're not psychic.

484
00:27:14,136 --> 00:27:17,052
Sorry, buddy. It's hard
to keep track of who knows what.

485
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,241
I broke away from Juliet,
tracked you on your little thingy.

486
00:27:20,408 --> 00:27:21,645
How'd you find him?

487
00:27:21,812 --> 00:27:24,142
Lassiter used the lojack
tracking system on his car.

488
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,814
I saw the location, snuck away while
Lassiter was working on the warrant.

489
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:31,150
Figured you guys were close.
And like me, you broke away...

490
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:34,069
- because you thought Ben was innocent.
- You're doing it again.

491
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,003
Am I? It's ridiculous.

492
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,913
- That's why you broke away from Juliet?
- Yep.

493
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,784
Needed to check it out for myself.

494
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:45,413
Well... Since we're both here,
we might as well do it together.

495
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,833
Sure. Whatever.

496
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,717
Ben.

497
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,263
No, wait, no!

498
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:04,557
Ben, we don't...
wait!

499
00:28:09,685 --> 00:28:11,785
Whatever the police think I did,

500
00:28:12,176 --> 00:28:13,191
I didn't do it.

501
00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:17,493
I'm a psychic with the police dept.
This is my partner, Santonio Holmes.

502
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,864
- We don't think you did it.
- Really?

503
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:23,025
You were more distraught than anyone
to hear that Desiree was dead.

504
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,663
Of course I was.
Just thinking about it makes me sick.

505
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,207
I want to find the person
who did this more than anything.

506
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:33,595
I've loved Desiree like... forever. We'd
been living together since we graduated.

507
00:28:34,174 --> 00:28:36,324
- When did you graduate?
- 2005.

508
00:28:38,955 --> 00:28:42,262
Lassiter's theory that he killed Desiree
to protect his money doesn't make sense.

509
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:45,098
They weren't common law
husband and wife.

510
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:51,905
Those rights don't kick in until
a couple has been together for 7 years.

511
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:53,832
And they moved in together in 2005,

512
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:56,599
- which was only three years ago.
- Five.

513
00:28:56,889 --> 00:28:59,154
I should start carrying
a pocket calendar.

514
00:28:59,428 --> 00:29:01,516
Ben, why did you run from the cops?

515
00:29:01,683 --> 00:29:05,278
Desiree's mom, she practically
accused me of causing Desiree's death.

516
00:29:05,445 --> 00:29:08,747
I thought she was the one who called
the cops on me, so... I panicked.

517
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,000
Ben, listen to me.
But also hear me.

518
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:15,419
You didn't do yourself
any favors by hiding.

519
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:18,757
I can convince the cops that you're
innocent, but only if you trust us.

520
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:21,843
- And you're sure...
- I'll do the touching.

521
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:25,814
- Sure they'll believe I'm innocent?
- I can guarantee it.

522
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,516
Freeze, you murderous dirt bag!

523
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:34,272
Ish.
I can guarantee it "ish."

524
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,693
Guys, please help me out here.

525
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,543
- Hang in there, Ben.
- Shawn... Santonio?

526
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,740
Can I at least get my phone call?

527
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,535
- If it wasn't a common law marriage?
- Innocents don't run from the police.

528
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,579
I have a hunch
that he's not our killer.

529
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,070
- We don't deal in hunches.
- "We"?

530
00:29:52,237 --> 00:29:55,240
I'm sorry, Shawn, but it's over.

531
00:29:57,225 --> 00:29:58,375
I understand.

532
00:29:58,738 --> 00:30:00,632
- It was fun while it lasted.
- It wasn't.

533
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,606
- We made a great team.
- We didn't.

534
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,876
It was a disaster!
Partners don't lie to one another,

535
00:30:06,043 --> 00:30:08,047
and partners don't run off
mid-investigation,

536
00:30:08,214 --> 00:30:10,350
and partners do not
go through my purse,

537
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,323
find my phone,
and text photos of my dog

538
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:15,622
to every guy in my address book
with the caption, "this is you."

539
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:18,608
- Partners support each other.
- We never support each other.

540
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,569
Yeah. We're constantly lying.
And running.

541
00:30:22,284 --> 00:30:24,334
- I miss that.
- Me too. What!

542
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:26,536
We're still hired on this case, Gus.

543
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,068
Let's work.
But first can we get something to eat?

544
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:32,204
I'm kind of hungry. All I've had all day
are sunflower seeds.

545
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:35,185
Are you kidding me?
I haven't eaten in almost two hours.

546
00:30:35,352 --> 00:30:36,709
Hamburgers!

547
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:40,259
- And then we try to free Ben.
- And then... Japa dogs.

548
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:42,606
What!

549
00:30:43,947 --> 00:30:47,947
Well, 1 thing's for sure from all this.
It's nice to have you back.

550
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:51,095
Thanks. I'm sorry you got stuck with
an extra caseload while I was gone.

551
00:30:51,262 --> 00:30:54,412
That's okay.
Besides, it's your extra caseload now.

552
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:57,647
It's good to be back.

553
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:00,304
- Woodrow, my good man.
- Shawn!

554
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,788
Always nice to see you
walk through that door.

555
00:31:02,955 --> 00:31:05,572
Well, let's hope you never
see me rolled in on a gurney.

556
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,826
I'd be honored to saw through your chest
and remove your heart from its cavity.

557
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,746
I'm touched. Woody, in your professional
opinion, how do I die?

558
00:31:14,187 --> 00:31:16,613
Murder. Gangland execution.
We never find your head.

559
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,501
- That's a shame.
- You slip in a tub.

560
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:23,024
We need you to tell us
everything you can about,

561
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,794
the death of Desiree Blake.

562
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:29,120
Cause of death in our victim...
Is confirmed to be drowning

563
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,927
Evidenced by the presence
of fluid in the lungs.

564
00:31:33,015 --> 00:31:36,060
- What about this mark on her ankle?
- Yeah. Interesting, isn't it?

565
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,633
- Almost looks like freezer burn.
- Freezer burn?

566
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,232
How would she get freezer burn
in 70-degree water?

567
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,152
Question is why would a drowning victim
show no signs of struggle?

568
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,678
- What do you mean?
- Well, there's no bruising on the body

569
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,510
Or... or cuts
or any kind of struggle.

570
00:31:53,898 --> 00:31:55,798
Hey. It's Ben's lab partner.

571
00:31:56,647 --> 00:32:00,651
When Ben been arrested, I rushed right
over. There's no way that he did this.

572
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,460
- We don't think so either.
- Yeah, but we need proof.

573
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,400
You know, Gus and I...

574
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:12,400
Discovered something
pretty interesting.

575
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:15,464
Did you two know that when
a tech enters Ben's lab,

576
00:32:15,631 --> 00:32:18,073
they have to swipe a security
card to gain entrance?

577
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,731
I wish there was some kind of record of
exactly what time he entered and exited

578
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,087
- on the day of the murder.
- Some kind of log.

579
00:32:24,254 --> 00:32:25,673
- Or a registry.
- Ledger.

580
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,169
- Duckit.
- Docket.

581
00:32:27,336 --> 00:32:29,582
- I've heard it...
- I haven't.

582
00:32:30,512 --> 00:32:32,712
Hey, what is that behind your ear?

583
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,588
Will you look at that?

584
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:39,649
It's the entrance record!

585
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:43,586
According to this, Ben works
at the time of the murder.

586
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:44,836
What?

587
00:32:46,343 --> 00:32:48,049
No way he could have killed Desiree.

588
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,549
- And now we revel.
- Alien-style.

589
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:56,379
Congratulations.
But you two are forgetting something.

590
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,143
- What's that, officer dad?
- Part-time officer dad.

591
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,521
There's still a killer out there.
Get to work.

592
00:33:06,993 --> 00:33:09,260
All right, what do we know
about this case?

593
00:33:09,427 --> 00:33:12,293
One... there's a woman who's dead.

594
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:14,997
Two, Ben didn't kill her.

595
00:33:15,164 --> 00:33:17,766
- Three, these japa dogs are delicious.
- I hear that.

596
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:21,332
You gotta give it to the Japanese. And
not because they invented the Chinese.

597
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:25,719
I almost took Lassiter to the japa dog
cart, but I felt like I was cheating.

598
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,797
Oh. That's so sweet, buddy.

599
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:32,073
He was a cheating bastard.

600
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,055
Desiree found out, and they had this
huge fight right before she disappeared.

601
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,931
Wait a minute.

602
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:43,380
Ben... cheated... on Desiree.

603
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:45,898
- Yes, he did.
- We never figured out with who.

604
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:47,348
He didn't say.

605
00:33:47,772 --> 00:33:50,819
She would have motive
to kill Desiree. Bingo!

606
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,713
We gotta get that out of Ben. How come
you're allowed to say bingo and I'm not?

607
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,784
Idem you're not
allowed to say "true DAT."

608
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,734
- True that.
- Exactly.

609
00:34:07,192 --> 00:34:08,192
Buzz!

610
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,174
- What's going on?
- They pulled a dead surfer out.

611
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:12,781
Dead surfer...

612
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:19,331
Oh, no.

613
00:34:21,663 --> 00:34:23,313
He... he's dead, Shawn.

614
00:34:27,646 --> 00:34:29,734
- Oh, man.
- Once again...

615
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,395
No sign of struggle.

616
00:34:31,562 --> 00:34:33,988
Fluid in the lungs.
Once, I wouldn't think as much of it.

617
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:38,242
But twice in one week with two victims
ho knew each other? That's suspicious.

618
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:41,203
What would be really awesome
is if it happened a third time.

619
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,468
You're saying that both drowned,
but neither of them died in the water.

620
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:47,971
How's that possible?

621
00:34:48,138 --> 00:34:49,879
- They were dry drowned.
- Come on.

622
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,883
You're putting words next to other that
sound like things we're talking about.

623
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,093
No! Actually...
He's right.

624
00:34:56,343 --> 00:34:59,068
Dry drowning can give
all the appearances of actual drowning.

625
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:01,974
It would have to be caused
by something like a methane gas leak

626
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:03,851
or an overdose of anesthesia.

627
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:09,450
<i>If you're interested,
you'll have to sign the consent forms.</i>

628
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:10,983
<i>You'll be put under anesthesia.</i>

629
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:14,695
Gus, we gotta get back to the lab.
You.

630
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:20,949
All right, we came down here
ya asked. Now what?

631
00:35:21,116 --> 00:35:23,676
Let's be honest.
We need you, and you need us.

632
00:35:23,843 --> 00:35:26,789
Let us all work together.
Watch it and feel it.

633
00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:29,202
I refuse to watch, and I'm sure
not gonna feel it.

634
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:32,619
- Feel what, Shawn?
- We're about to get a confession.

635
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:40,346
Tonya. Got bad news.
These are cops, this is Dion Richmond...

636
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,079
No, I'm a psychic.

637
00:35:42,246 --> 00:35:44,308
I see things, and I feel things.

638
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:47,186
- Do you wanna feel what you see?
- I can't lose.

639
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,730
- Have you no shame?
- I'm not here to play!

640
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,399
with a cold-blooded killer.

641
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,860
You had an affair with Ben.
Don't deny.

642
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,684
- Guilty as charged.
- Boom... Shaka!

643
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,740
- That's gotta be a new record.
- Cuff her, Lassie.

644
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:03,119
What? It's not like
he croaked while we were doing it.

645
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,079
You wanted Ben all for yourself.

646
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:06,780
No, I didn't.

647
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:10,136
We hooked up once,
and he totally freaked out.

648
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:13,254
He loved his girl.
Whatever. The beat goes on.

649
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,339
Not Ben's.

650
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:18,510
Likely story. You had access to the
anesthesia that dry drowned him.

651
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,942
I'm a part-time assistant.

652
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:25,099
I mean, do you think they
actually let me near that stuff?

653
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,394
My security badge gets me in and out
of the front door and into the bathroom.

654
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,355
I don't get anywhere near
the actual experiments.

655
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:34,555
You'd have to go to Devry
or something for that.

656
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:43,701
Yes. Interesting, indeed.

657
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,452
Looks like freezer burn.

658
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,289
I'm calling an audible.

659
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,958
I'm sensing something very strong.

660
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,695
I'm getting a strong,

661
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,130
jealous, spiteful...

662
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,917
spirit vibe here.

663
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,922
Right... In here.

664
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,386
It's strong here, but mostly here.

665
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,681
Yes. You. Lillian.

666
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,602
You were jealous of Ben
and Desiree's relationship.

667
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:11,354
Ridiculous.

668
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:15,358
Miss, a second. Spencer, what's the
deal? Am I cuffing Charlotte the Harlot?

669
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,277
No. Sorry.
You and I are back on dirty.

670
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:22,406
Lillian killed Desiree Blake because
she wanted Ben all for herself.

671
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:24,825
- That's crazy.
- Maybenot.

672
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:28,814
In your statement to us, you did refer
to Ben as a great boyfriend,

673
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:31,874
and yougot him out of jail
before we'd finished processing him.

674
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,293
Come on.
Of course you fell for him.

675
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,170
He was your partner.
He...

676
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,825
He shared with you.
He confided in you, trusted you.

677
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:42,259
But Ben never referred to her
as anything other than a coworker.

678
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,429
Come on, it's obvious
why he'd go for that one... She's easy.

679
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,807
I was more than a coworker.
I cared for him.

680
00:37:50,356 --> 00:37:52,728
Everyone knew that Ben and
Desiree were getting married.

681
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,982
Ben made a mistake
and cheated on Desiree.

682
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,776
She moved out, and you saw that
as your opportunity.

683
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,736
Who are you calling a mistake?

684
00:38:00,986 --> 00:38:03,636
- Isn't it obvious?
- How did I miss this?

685
00:38:08,983 --> 00:38:10,921
- What is he doing?
- It gives him clarity.

686
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:16,502
Yeah, Lassie, I don't think we have time
to give the savion glover treatment.

687
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:23,605
Even after Ben cheated, He still pined
for Desiree. He wanted her back,

688
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:26,595
and you realized you would have to
get rid of her for good.

689
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:30,874
So you brought her to this lab and
gave her a high dose of anesthesia that

690
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:33,227
caused her to dry drown!

691
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,312
- I taught him that.
- We know.

692
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:37,104
You just had to get rid of the body.

693
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,443
So you put Desiree behind the wheel
of her car and drove it into the lake,

694
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,946
weighing down the accelerator with one
of those blocks of frozen water

695
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,646
that you use
for freezing lab samples.

696
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,455
Dry ice is not frozen water.
It's carbon dioxide.

697
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,648
- They do share the same...
- Not now.

698
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:56,500
I can't do this with you now.

699
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,045
The point is, the evidence melted.
Very clever.

700
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:03,257
All you had to do was be there for Ben,
and he would fall for you like you had.

701
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,177
Except he didn't feel
the same way about you.

702
00:39:06,468 --> 00:39:08,762
I wanna find the person
who did this more than anything.

703
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:13,099
You were so delusional, you thought he
would be touched by your murderous act.

704
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:17,893
Of course, he was not,
because you are a crazy dry drowner.

705
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,614
And in the heat of the moment, it
was either you or him.

706
00:39:22,148 --> 00:39:24,403
- And you chose you!
- Nice, Lassie.

707
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,489
Way to tap your way
back to the party.

708
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,866
A 2d review of the body
will trace the anesthesia

709
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,743
used to kill them back to your lab.

710
00:39:31,031 --> 00:39:32,578
He should have been with me.

711
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:34,796
This is all her fault.

712
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:38,209
Hands behind your back, please.

713
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,021
- Well played, Shawn.
- Well played, everybody.

714
00:39:41,188 --> 00:39:44,757
Way to roll with the punches. You never
know which way it's gonna come and go.

715
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,342
Psychically speaking.

716
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:50,748
- Thank you for agreeing to meet me.
- Sure.

717
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,267
Let's hope this goes better
than the last couple of days.

718
00:39:56,545 --> 00:39:59,695
- Not that they were that bad.
- They were horrific.

719
00:41:05,937 --> 00:41:07,038
- All right?
- OK.

720
00:41:07,205 --> 00:41:08,606
Again, from the top.

721
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,253
That's my partner up there!

722
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,242
- Black guy's my partner.
- They're both black.

723
00:41:56,953 --> 00:41:59,203
I know who the West Side rapist is.

724
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:03,215
And that's... my partner.

725
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,429
Kids, come on, freestyle.
One, two, three, four.
