00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,792
<i>Last season on</i> Psych<i>...</i>

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,940
We've been discussing
creating a new position...

3
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:07,256
A liaison working with other departments,
agencies, outside help.

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,382
Psychics.

5
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,765
You got to do something quick!
I can't hold it for long!

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,436
- I accept.
- Excuse me?

7
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:26,567
The job, the job
you offered me, Karen...

8
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,850
I accept.
It's great to be back.

9
00:00:33,302 --> 00:00:35,802
I'm warning you guys.
Gus knows karate.

10
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:38,397
- I don't know karate.
- Yes, you do.

11
00:00:38,522 --> 00:00:39,497
I study wushu.

12
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:40,618
It's Chinese.

13
00:00:40,743 --> 00:00:43,250
Dude, trust me.
Karate sounds more intimidating.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,795
I've only had two lessons.

15
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,588
2 more lessons than they've had.

16
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:50,247
Come on, man.
My dad wouldn't let me take karate,

17
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:51,759
so now you got to do this.

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,225
You do it.

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,810
I don't fire people well.

20
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:06,811
- You wanted the assistant.
- I wanted a girl.

21
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:09,187
He's the only one
that would take the job, Shawn.

22
00:01:09,589 --> 00:01:11,321
What does that say about us?

23
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:15,565
We'll do good cop/bad cop.

24
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,202
- Who's bad cop?
- You. You're the unscrupulous boss

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,787
with a chip on your shoulder.

26
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,066
I'm the nurturing-confidant type,
who's like, "dude, Gus is a jerk,

27
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:26,024
"but I've got your back.
Together we'll take that sucker down."

28
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:29,505
Together, then.

29
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:30,798
Fine.

30
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:33,691
Ken!

31
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,092
And it turns out business
is just a little slower

32
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:40,307
than expected.

33
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:44,073
You guys hired me four days ago.

34
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,196
Much slower.

35
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:47,606
The thing is, my dad got a job
at the police station, right?

36
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:49,900
So we assumed
that we'd get more cases.

37
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,882
He assumed.
I called this from a mile away.

38
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:53,207
Exactly. Wait.

39
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:56,782
- Holy crap, you're doing good cop.
- I know.

40
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:20,765
- Did somebody move my desk?
- I didn't see anyone.

41
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:24,143
How many days a week are you here?

42
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:27,396
Two, three, depends.
I just deal with the consultants.

43
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:30,566
- But you don't tell me what to do.
- I'm not sure.

44
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:31,586
I am.

45
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:32,651
You don't.

46
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:36,113
Think of it like Santa Barbara's having
a slow news day,

47
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,617
- but with murder and stuff.
- And like the real-estate market,

48
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,470
- crime will always trend upwards.
- The only thing we know for sure,

49
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:42,651
it's gonna pick up.

50
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:45,789
And that real estate is
a sound long-term investment.

51
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:48,262
But mostly
that crime's gonna pick up.

52
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:49,794
And that's a guarantee.

53
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,257
Excuse me, Mr. Chiang.

54
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:02,890
Can I get a photo of you and your family
for the <i>Santa Barbara Courier</i>?

55
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,726
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please have your raffle tickets ready</i>

56
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:17,156
<i>when entering
the Chinatown festival.</i>

57
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,707

Psych 501

00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,929
Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

60
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,584
She didn't come back on Monday?

61
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:37,670
Not yet.

62
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,126
Just let our people do their work.

63
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:47,250
If and when we get the ransom call,
we will determine our course of action.

64
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,685
Mr. Chiang...

65
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:56,271
I'm the resident psychic here.
My name is Shawn Spencer.

66
00:05:57,384 --> 00:06:00,512
This is my partner
Jonathan Jacob Jingly Smith.

67
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:05,239
You're saying his name is
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt?

68
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,567
That's correct, sir.
We used to share the name.

69
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:11,036
I changed mine because of all
the people shouting when I went out.

70
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:13,122
I don't remember calling you,
Mr. Spencer.

71
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,569
Didn't have to, chief.
This case called me.

72
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:17,543
- It called collect.
- Right, which was odd,

73
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,337
because I'm also on Twitter,
and the cases usually tweet me.

74
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:24,008
Now, let's be honest, chief.
Kidnapping is my thing.

75
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,844
This case is tailor-made
for a psychic.

76
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,508
I guess it does make
a little bit of sense.

77
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:32,808
You called Shawn in?

78
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,560
- The case called me.
- Collect.

79
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,843
Naturally, this is your call, Henry.
You now oversee our consultants.

80
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:41,471
So this would officially be
your first hire.

81
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,818
Okay, then.

82
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:44,945
My answer is no.

83
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:46,345
What?

84
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:48,615
May I speak to you in private?

85
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,453
What the hell was that about?

86
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:54,597
It's my job to determine
if we need a consultant,

87
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:56,623
and right now
I don't see the need for one.

88
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,460
You have had 5 opportunities to hire us.
Now, what is this really about?

89
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:02,963
- Do you know "persona non grata"?
- Why are we talking about food?

90
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,758
There's a reason
they created the position I'm in.

91
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,677
You burned a lot of bridges around here.
You made a lot of sloppy mistakes.

92
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,388
You're must to earn your way back.
Things are gonna be different.

93
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:13,432
- So unfair.
- Is it?

94
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,685
My results speak for themselves.
You hold me to a different standard.

95
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:18,729
I do not.

96
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:22,608
- You buried my easter eggs.
- I left loose dirt to indicate a dig.

97
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:25,861
Yeah, under a camouflaged tarp
covered with bricks and broken glass.

98
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,196
That was the giveaway!

99
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,407
Pardon me for trying
to challenge you.

100
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,591
It took me three weeks "to close"
the egg investigation.

101
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,287
I was eight.

102
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:36,663
Just so you know,

103
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,625
there's still two eggs
you haven't found.

104
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:42,663
You're sick.

105
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,975
Well? What happened?

106
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,287
Two things...
One, we're getting him fired.

107
00:07:48,412 --> 00:07:51,281
- Two, we're on the case.
- You convinced him to hire us?

108
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:52,514
Define convinced.

109
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:56,475
Have we searched
the girl's apartment?

110
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,644
- They just finished.
- We'll need that address.

111
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,704
- You guys got hired on the case.
- Define hired.

112
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:09,729
The police have already been here.
She was kidnapped far from here.

113
00:08:09,854 --> 00:08:12,417
It's been hours, Gus.
Still no ransom demand.

114
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:15,224
I'm telling you,
this is not your standard kidnapping.

115
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:18,455
God, everything's so neat.

116
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:21,291
- Maybe she's a neat person.
- Or maybe she's hiding something.

117
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:25,754
Look at this closet.

118
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,464
It's full of new purchases.

119
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:04,391
Please tell me we're taking
that to the police.

120
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,212
We are...
Just not the ones working this case.

121
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:18,308
- Bring that to Lassiter.
- What would be the fun in that?

122
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,641
I want you for this.

123
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:23,820
- Chief wouldn't hire you guys, huh?
- I got case-blocked by my own father.

124
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:26,190
Don't you think it's time
you got back up on the horse?

125
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:28,817
It's a temporary reassignment.

126
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,267
It's pretty common for cops

127
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:33,155
when they experience
something traumatic.

128
00:09:34,565 --> 00:09:37,514
I know the whole Yin thing was difficult
for everybody, but at this point,

129
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:40,871
it just feels like you're hiding here
at this giant post office.

130
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,470
- It's city hall, Shawn.
- We have a city hall?

131
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,633
I just need a little time.

132
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:48,253
And I am perfectly content
staying off of this case.

133
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,462
Really? Did you know
there's no ransom note?

134
00:09:50,587 --> 00:09:52,530
Did you know that Bekki Chiang
stands to inherit

135
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:55,093
approximately $20 million
and is already being groomed

136
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,133
for an ambassadorship at 19?

137
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,271
Not my case.
It's Lassiter's.

138
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:11,068
It's an old Hong Kong 50-cent piece.

139
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,195
- Which dynasty?
- 1978.

140
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,657
Look at that.
Somebody's helping already

141
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,601
There is one other thing.

142
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:22,579
It's counterfeit.

143
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:29,763
A smart rich girl with a secret
holding on to counterfeit money?

144
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:33,090
And just what are you doing here?

145
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,841
The mayor asked to see me.

146
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,344
- e don't believe that.
- You're free to believe what you want.

147
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,953
Don't say that to Gus. He'll tell you
that Michael Jackson isn't dead.

148
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:44,874
- He learned how to fake his death.
- Which implies that Elvis is alive.

149
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:47,479
Elvis died two years ago.
Is there no end to your gullibility?

150
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:51,017
I told you that two years ago.
He was a cashier in a shoe shop.

151
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:54,194
I'm not having this conversation
with you now or ever.

152
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,737
We're not sure what the deal
with the wrapping on the hand is.

153
00:10:56,862 --> 00:10:59,992
And he leapt a wall into the crowd,
so he's athletic.

154
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,994
Kept his face covered
the whole time.

155
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,330
Couldn't get a clear shot of him.
He knew there were cameras there.

156
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,053
Carlton, I have a lot of work
to do here, so if you wouldn't mind...

157
00:11:08,178 --> 00:11:10,228
My god, we're on the same page.

158
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:14,320
You were trying to lure her out
of this dungeon by using details.

159
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:15,340
I am not.

160
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,883
See, it's not just me.

161
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:19,803
You're concerned about her
insisting on staying down here...

162
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:23,073
The unreturned phone calls
and the ever-so-slight darkening

163
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:24,266
of the hair.

164
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:26,674
- I hadn't noticed.
- I like it.

165
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:30,411
Now, would you guys
please just leave me alone?

166
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:34,443
Way to go, Spencer.
You are not on this case.

167
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:37,700
What? Lassie, we've clearly
crossed a threshold.

168
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:40,813
Tomorrow we should wear jumpsuits...
Nay, t-shirts.

169
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:43,744
I'll be thing one.
You be thing two.

170
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,079
- Excuse me.
- Wait.

171
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,652
Before you go, one question...
Who would counterfeit a 50-cent piece,

172
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,045
- Honk Kong, 978 dynasty?
- 1978.

173
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:55,057
Ooh, that makes so much more sense.

174
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:58,527
You can't seriously tell me you think
the triads are involved in this?

175
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,129
- Athletes.
- Chinese gangs.

176
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,805
- Athletic gangs of Chinese men.
- Very serious gangs.

177
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,684
- How do we speak with these triads?
- You don't speak with them.

178
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,473
- I need to make an appointment.
- There are different gangs

179
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,209
within the triads. What triad are we
talking about? The golden?

180
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:14,878
- The dragon?
- Regular.

181
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:16,777
We're primarily interested
in medium.

182
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:18,547
- Venti.
- Venti is large.

183
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,117
Well, then not venti.
We'll speak with both gangs.

184
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,617
No. Spencer, you will stay
away from these people.

185
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:27,940
They are legitimately dangerous, those
gangs are on the verge of war for years.

186
00:12:28,065 --> 00:12:31,352
Now, if you'll excuse me, the free
information train has left the station.

187
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:33,460
Figure it all out for yourself.

188
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:35,934
Please.
Like we can't do that.

189
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,066
- We need information.
- Wait.

190
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:42,004
You aren't here to paymy last day?

191
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,970
- I believe I did pay.
- We didn't pay.

192
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,509
We paid him in gratitude
and life lessons.

193
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,600
I shouldn't have opened this door.

194
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,537
Don't think of it as not being paid.

195
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:53,480
Think of it
as a surprise two-year vacation.

196
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,767
- Unpaid.
- We'll hire you back someday.

197
00:12:55,892 --> 00:12:57,019
Probably not soon.

198
00:12:57,436 --> 00:12:58,777
Why are you guys here?

199
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,325
We need information on
counterfeiting Hong Kong coins.

200
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,793
And the Chinese mafia.

201
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:06,785
We need you to explain the ending
of crouching tiger, hidden dragon to us.

202
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:07,953
What?

203
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:11,879
You guys think that 'cause I'm Asian,
I'm supposed to know all this stuff.

204
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:13,458
That's borderline racist.

205
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,685
- No.
- Racist. No, I hardly think so.

206
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,463
- Inappropriate? Insulting? Stereotype?
- Yes. Sure.

207
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:20,715
- Not racist.
- Maybe a little racist.

208
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,592
Gus, please. Now, Ken,

209
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,054
how many triads do you know,
and/or are you one of them?

210
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,877
That definitely crossed the line.

211
00:13:28,002 --> 00:13:32,006
Just tell us what you know, and we will
get out of your parents' house.

212
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:36,192
Okay, the only thing I can
think of is there's this place

213
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:39,895
where the golden triad used to hang out.
The only reason I know that

214
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,113
is because my mother
used to forbid me to go there.

215
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:52,254
Gus, all I'm saying
is that sometimes

216
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:53,610
your jokes don't land.

217
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:56,895
Okay, Shawn, you want to
impose some restrictions on me,

218
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,022
then I want to go
over some rules too.

219
00:13:59,147 --> 00:14:00,116
What rules?

220
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:02,985
In the past, you've offered me up
as some sort of sacrificial lamb

221
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,844
- to the situation.
- Name one.

222
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,069
Wait. Never mind.
You're right.

223
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,125
New rule...
from now on,

224
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,128
any cover story or fake I.D.
Must be run past me

225
00:14:12,253 --> 00:14:13,763
- and approved.
- Approved?

226
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,965
In writing three days in advance.

227
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,900
- Gus, you're kidding?
- No.

228
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,503
I need the proper amount of time
to concoct my alter ego

229
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:22,562
That best complements yours
and the situation.

230
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:26,691
- Don't know where I'll live in 3 days.
- That's the deal. Take it or leave it.

231
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,713
So he is a pharmaceutical salesman

232
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:33,497
Who moonlights
at a psychic Detective agency,

233
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,185
And once at camp, he wet his pants.

234
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,221
- Water splashed on my pants.
- I'm sorry. You guys are cops?

235
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,391
Nope, not cops, though
sometimes we work with cops

236
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,995
And occasionally against them.

237
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,297
If this was Saturday,
I'd have a better story.

238
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:51,056
Right now all I want to do
is talk to some triads.

239
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,324
Either kind.

240
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:55,810
You guys know
you're gonna get killed.

241
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,313
You're absolutely right.
What were we thinking? Gus?

242
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,815
Yes. See what I mean?

243
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,906
See what you mean?
We got lucky.

244
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:18,907
We have been following this guy.

245
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:21,997
If he's a triad, He is the most boring
gang member of all time.

246
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25,468
I think Ken gave us a fake lead to
pay you back for asking him for a loan.

247
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:27,236
It was a loan with interest.

248
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:29,761
The interest
was life lessons, Shawn.

249
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:37,680
Those are some heavy firearms.
Something's going down.

250
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,270
Run back to the psych office,
grab our ninja costumes.

251
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:42,384
How could that possibly help us?

252
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,920
- We'll need to get closer.
- No, we are staying here.

253
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,842
Ten seconds ago,
you were complaining about being bored.

254
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,425
Now, it's too exciting?

255
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,829
It'd be great to get some consistency
from you emotionally.

256
00:15:51,954 --> 00:15:53,535
If something illegal is going on,

257
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,908
it's our duty to call Lassie
and let him get shot.

258
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:59,768
- Golden triads cut off hands.
- One at a time, which, technically,

259
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,972
- means we have four opportunities.
- I'm not moving.

260
00:16:03,097 --> 00:16:05,197
They won't even know we're here.

261
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:11,638
I blame you.

262
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,317
He said something
about taking us to the boss.

263
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,887
If only I had time to submit
a fake identity.

264
00:16:18,012 --> 00:16:19,655
Dont mock me when I'm about to die.

265
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,897
You know I bond with authority. This is
a win for us. I will talk my way out.

266
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,565
- How?
- You know how much I love Yao ming.

267
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,152
- That's got to count for something.
- Just leave me out of this.

268
00:16:31,684 --> 00:16:33,134
Okay, first of all,

269
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,317
this is some sort
of huge misunderstanding.

270
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:39,080
I know and respect
that you are a very busy man.

271
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:41,911
Running a crime syndicate
is a full-time job.

272
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:45,486
And we do not want to bother you
any more than we have to.

273
00:16:49,303 --> 00:16:50,353
Mr. Chiang.

274
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:54,387
I know you.

275
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:57,913
You're the psychic
from the police station.

276
00:16:58,286 --> 00:17:00,576
Yes.
That's correct.

277
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:04,105
- They hired us on this case.
- The chief said they did not.

278
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:07,442
- I don't know why she'd say that.
- She said it to you.

279
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,470
Yes, she did.

280
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:11,253
Chief.

281
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,531
That's a little act we do
to throw people off.

282
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,908
To throw who off?

283
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:18,534
Mr. Chiang, I found this coin
in your daughter's apartment.

284
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:19,788
It was hidden.

285
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:23,917
My fear is that she's mixed up
with some pretty nasty criminals.

286
00:17:24,452 --> 00:17:25,752
This is my coin.

287
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:28,630
I gave it to her
to symbolize our past.

288
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,032
Now, I will say this to you.

289
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:34,969
And I will speak slowly
so you understand.

290
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:38,580
She's not mixed up in any of this.

291
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,634
This...
Criminal activity?

292
00:17:43,014 --> 00:17:45,730
What you think you see here
is not criminal.

293
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,033
It seems pretty criminal to me.

294
00:17:57,439 --> 00:18:01,003
Our mistake. It's just a handful
of buddies hanging out,

295
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,041
taking some surveillance photos
and carrying semiautomatic weapons.

296
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:08,837
You have an idea of who took
your daughter.

297
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,297
- I do not.
- And you wouldn't lie to me.

298
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,933
You're a psychic.

299
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,052
You tell me.

300
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,513
Are we free to go?

301
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:21,725
All right.

302
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:31,570
There was a curlicue thing here,
but the whole thing looks like a dragon.

303
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,738
I know this, 'cause I saw something
like it at a panda express.

304
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,115
Can you tell us what it is or not?

305
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,496
- Dude, my parents run a best buy.
- I told you.

306
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:41,805
- About the best buy?
- I told you he would be offended.

307
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,038
- He's not offended.
- I am very offended.

308
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,542
He's excited. He's getting a taste of
the action that you and I get into,

309
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,003
if we hadn't had to let him go.

310
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,755
Do you realize that I've done
more work for you since you fired me?

311
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,134
Yes, we do.
Have you seen this dragon?

312
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:59,582
I probably saw something like that
spray-painted on a wall.

313
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,752
- Where?
- Chinatown.

314
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,565
- What?
- Where in Chinatown?

315
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,037
A martial arts studio.

316
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,445
Why does this have orange
chicken sauce all over it?

317
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,182
It got me in the mood for some panda
express. Can you tell us what this is?

318
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:22,786
Dragon triads.
Shawn, what do you want from me?

319
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,955
That's what they were doing.
They were surveilling their enemies.

320
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,832
- Who did what?
- Who cares...

321
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,918
Who cares to know who capptured us

322
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,893
The question is, what would happen

323
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,839
if the dragon triad kidnapped someone
from the golden triad?

324
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,899
- Ridiculous It would never happen.
- Let's just say it did.

325
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:40,637
It would start off a gang war.
It's beyond suicide.

326
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,011
No, she's right. Goldens and Dragons
can't be seen In each other's territory.

327
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:47,185
Oh! I'm gonna have all of you
banned from this building.

328
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,483
- Excuse me. I'm here for a class.
- This class?

329
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:56,784
- Yeah, I believe it starts...
- In five minutes.

330
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,500
Five minutes from now.

331
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,616
I'm usually ten minutes early,
so I'm already feeling behind.

332
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:04,619
This class is for five
to eight-year-olds.

333
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:06,919
Yes.
Yes, it is.

334
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,084
And, uh, that's what I call, uh...

335
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,627
Discrimination.

336
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:14,576
- Discrimination?
- Yes.

337
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,798
- And eism.
- Who are you?

338
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,510
- I'm his lawyer.
- You brought a lawyer?

339
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:24,639
I keep a lawyer on retainer
at all times. There is so much injustice

340
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,643
that you practically can't leave home
without one. And today it paid off.

341
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,570
Right. Okay, well,
I will see you in court, then.

342
00:20:31,695 --> 00:20:33,731
Now...
perfect. Now, I'll need

343
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,349
a statement from you, and as we plan to
try this in civil and criminal court,

344
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,257
I'll need the police here as well.

345
00:20:39,382 --> 00:20:40,670
Can I use your phone?

346
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:43,373
Or do you only let
the white people use that?

347
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:45,836
- Who said anything about white people?
- You just did.

348
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:49,038
The words "white people"
did not come out of my mouth.

349
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,625
There they are again. Luckily,
I had my hand recorder on for that one.

350
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:56,671
And by the way, I am now disclosing that
this conversation is being recorded.

351
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,089
Re... recorded?

352
00:20:58,443 --> 00:20:59,632
Okay, this is crazy.

353
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,775
Crazy?
You want to know crazy?

354
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,887
I sued 300 businesses
last year alone.

355
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,972
I sued a hot-dog cart
and got everything

356
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,280
but the wheels and the buns,

357
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,596
which I won in the civil case
two months later.

358
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:11,721
Dude.

359
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:15,064
I think he gets it now.

360
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,735
I know, but the words are coming out
of my mouth faster than I can think.

361
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:22,094
- Bring it home.
- Now, if you don't mind,

362
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,158
Before I start snapping evidence photos,
I'm a little parched.

363
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,494
So can you tell me which one
of these fountains I'm allowed to use?

364
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,662
That one.

365
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,791
I mean...
Y-you pick, sir.

366
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,747
One, two, three, four,

367
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,051
five, six,

368
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:44,967
seven, eight,

369
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,196
nine, ten.

370
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,757
One, two, three, four...

371
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,731
- Ow! What?
- Focus.

372
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,741
- Sorry.
- You have no focus. Why?

373
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,844
I... look, it's just...

374
00:22:04,112 --> 00:22:05,740
You want to know the truth?

375
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,825
My dad never let me take karate.

376
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,443
This is not karate.

377
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,844
But it's pretty much the same thing.

378
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,673
- Not the same thing.
- All right.

379
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,167
Now turn your eyes around
and follow.

380
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,211
One...

381
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:25,882
And...

382
00:22:32,357 --> 00:22:35,577
- Did you find out anything?
- Yes. I'm awesome at karate.

383
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:37,790
- Wushu.
- Yeah, that. I'm awesome at it.

384
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:40,081
You were in there for 2 hours,
and you did kung fu?

385
00:22:40,206 --> 00:22:42,384
No, we stretched our groins.
We meditated.

386
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:45,253
Did you find out anything
about the case, Shawn?

387
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:49,382
Upstairs is the headquarters for the
dragon. They may hide the girl there,

388
00:22:50,016 --> 00:22:52,286
- But that's not important.
- Not important?

389
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:55,122
- I kicked a board in half.
- No, you didn't.

390
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,376
You're right. But it splintered.
Do you have any idea what this means?

391
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,138
I sat for 2 hours
while you fulfilled a childhood dream.

392
00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:03,181
Let's stake this place out tonight.

393
00:23:03,306 --> 00:23:05,675
And I'll need $300
for the initiation fee.

394
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,409
You signed up for class?

395
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:09,411
- They are the bad guys.
- Upstairs.

396
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:12,223
Master Wu is not affiliated
with these hooligans.

397
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:24,527
- Chief.
- How we doing, O'Hara?

398
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:25,778
Good.

399
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,321
Great.
Great.

400
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,587
- Great.
- Great?

401
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,910
- Great.
- Great.

402
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:37,024
You know, there's no shame
in feeling what you're feeling.

403
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,964
That yin case is the kind of thing
that can shut a person down.

404
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:41,339
You too, chief?

405
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:44,422
Look, I will come back to work
when I am ready.

406
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:47,383
I'm not here to force
your hand... just wanted to ask.

407
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,452
I just...
they say to take some time.

408
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:52,764
- It's recommended.
- Of course.

409
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:57,693
Just make sure you know when the healing
ends and the delaying begins.

410
00:23:57,818 --> 00:23:58,818
Of course.

411
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:00,628
I will.
Thank you.

412
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:02,365
Great.

413
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:04,873
So here you go.

414
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:07,184
Stoplight safety project.

415
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,864
Track and compare
every light, cross-refernce

416
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,742
with each stop sign.
Tell me if two years isn't enough

417
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,636
of a sample to draw a conclusion.

418
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:18,259
I'll have McNab
bring the rest down later.

419
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:20,546
Good luck, O'Hara.

420
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,556
That's it. I think that'swhy my dad
wouldn't let me take karate.

421
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:31,660
Because he knew, he knew
I was too good, too dangerous.

422
00:24:31,785 --> 00:24:33,728
One moment, I'd be mastering
the high kick.

423
00:24:33,853 --> 00:24:36,772
The next, I'd be holding
a beating heart in my hand.

424
00:24:36,897 --> 00:24:38,490
- Uh, Shawn?
- What?

425
00:24:43,685 --> 00:24:45,035
Is that our...?

426
00:24:45,593 --> 00:24:46,593
Kidnapper.

427
00:24:51,738 --> 00:24:53,488
Only one way to find out.

428
00:24:54,357 --> 00:24:55,952
That 2d-floor window's open.

429
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,723
I saw this in a Jackie Chan movie.

430
00:24:57,848 --> 00:25:00,619
- Climbing bouncing from wall to wall.
- You can't bounce to the 2d floor.

431
00:25:00,744 --> 00:25:03,537
I think you're neglecting
my martial arts training.

432
00:25:03,662 --> 00:25:05,562
You talk of
the one class you had today?

433
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:06,964
Yes, Gus, I am.

434
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:09,664
You know what?
Just give me a boost.

435
00:25:10,178 --> 00:25:11,178
All right.

436
00:25:21,123 --> 00:25:22,123
We're in.

437
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,162
Hey, man, we know
you're the kidnapper.

438
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,024
And we can do this
the easy way or the...

439
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,561
You must be out of your damn...

440
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,521
We're not with this guy.

441
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:08,323
Actually, we just now met him.

442
00:26:08,448 --> 00:26:10,207
- After we broke in.
- Accidentally.

443
00:26:10,332 --> 00:26:12,052
We fell through a window.

444
00:26:12,177 --> 00:26:14,322
In our defense,
this is the guy that's stealing stuff.

445
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,942
He already had the safe open.

446
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:18,394
Which he didn't have to crack,
which means he's a pro.

447
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:20,409
He stole a jacket,
which is a weird thing.

448
00:26:20,534 --> 00:26:22,663
Agreed. Especially since
he had a sweatshirt.

449
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,998
It's not that cold.

450
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,172
So you see, we're
a couple good Samaritans.

451
00:26:26,297 --> 00:26:27,809
We don't expect a reward.

452
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:29,531
- Silence!
- You don't get it!

453
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:30,880
We don't want to fight.

454
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,853
- We're evenly matched.
- Evenly?

455
00:26:32,978 --> 00:26:35,051
It's 3-on-3. I've had my lesson.
You have your karate.

456
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:38,262
It's not karate, Shawn.
It's wushu. Sounds more authentic.

457
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,880
It sounds delicious
is what it sounds.

458
00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:09,234
- I'm going in.
- What?

459
00:27:31,057 --> 00:27:33,207
Gus, those are cleaning supplies.

460
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,287
Maybe we should just chill out and wait
for these guys to kill each other.

461
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,768
- He went that way!
- I'm trying to stay alive.

462
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,771
Gus, that is our kidnapper.
I can scale that in a single leap.

463
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,480
- What?
- Shawn!

464
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:35,831
- We lost him!
- Right behind.

465
00:28:35,956 --> 00:28:39,706
- The guy we're chasing?
- I'm talking about the guy chasing us.

466
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:52,457
My spiritual senses are out of control.
I can't believe I didn'tdid it earlier.

467
00:28:52,582 --> 00:28:54,674
We got lucky because
we hid like little girls.

468
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,649
Gus, don't be the ten tigers of canton.
We've reached a new level.

469
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,470
I rest my case.

470
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,729
<i>Couldn't get a clear shot of him.
It's as if he knew there were cameras.</i>

471
00:29:34,304 --> 00:29:35,604
Dude, that's it.

472
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:37,843
That's her jacket.
We found her.

473
00:29:37,968 --> 00:29:39,883
- I'll call the police.
- No, no, no, Gus.

474
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:41,736
That was so us last week.

475
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:45,206
We've been riding everyone's
coattails this whole time.

476
00:29:45,657 --> 00:29:47,275
I say we take him down now.

477
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,350
What do you mean now?
Shawn!

478
00:30:08,087 --> 00:30:10,075
- Are you coming in?
- I was waiting.

479
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,131
- It's been 10 minutes. I could be dead.
- If you recall, I didn't want to go in.

480
00:30:14,256 --> 00:30:16,587
So you leave me with our suspect?
What was your plan?

481
00:30:16,712 --> 00:30:18,756
I was waiting to hear
if there was any scream.

482
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:22,317
Depending on how bad it sounded, I would
advance. And if there was any pleading,

483
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,797
- that was also a variable.
- Holy crap. Are you checking email?

484
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:27,817
I need to be productive
when I'm nervous.

485
00:30:27,942 --> 00:30:29,692
Just come on.
God bless!

486
00:30:31,736 --> 00:30:35,740
Gus, this is Sang Tan. His father
is the leader of the dragon triad.

487
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,085
This is the lovely Bekki.

488
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:40,171
And they are in love.

489
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,366
And your father's the leader
of the golden triad?

490
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:45,439
- I get it. It's Romeo and Juliet.
- Kind of.

491
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:48,653
Our relationship was discovered.
I had to get her safe.

492
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:51,390
People die from these kind
of indiscretions.

493
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:54,935
I went to her in the alley, and we ran.
Things got out of control.

494
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,813
You need to tell the police
that this is not a kidnapping.

495
00:30:58,265 --> 00:31:00,933
- It's not that simple.
- It's pretty simple.

496
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,384
I'm pregnant.

497
00:31:04,093 --> 00:31:06,637
My father will never stand for this.

498
00:31:06,762 --> 00:31:09,606
I've been chosen to take over
for him when he retires.

499
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:13,204
There's no changing that plan.
I just need a day to get some cash

500
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:17,208
and get some things in order. You're
part Chinese. You must understand.

501
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,268
- You're damn right I do.
- You told him you were Chinese?

502
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:22,449
Gus, I am part Chinese...
Now.

503
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:26,018
We'll never make it like this.

504
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:27,927
Can you help us?

505
00:31:28,249 --> 00:31:29,553
- Of course.
- No.

506
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,394
Let me get this straight. You're saying
that we should stop the investigation.

507
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,077
Yes, indeed.

508
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:39,203
Chief, there is more going on here

509
00:31:39,328 --> 00:31:41,572
- than meets the eye.
- That's certainly a tactic

510
00:31:41,697 --> 00:31:45,309
that we've never tried before.
And what are you also suggesting...

511
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:48,197
That we cross our fingers
and perhaps hope for the best?

512
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,990
I have an idea of what we could do.

513
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:51,862
Don't. Don't do it. Don't...

514
00:31:51,987 --> 00:31:53,911
Chief. Before, moments ago,

515
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:56,163
It was fuzzy.

516
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,531
I'm upgrading it to crystal clear.

517
00:31:58,693 --> 00:32:00,393
Wait, I want to be sure.

518
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:02,864
Yes, crystal clear.
This is not a kidnapping.

519
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:06,385
Really? If it's not a kidnapping,
why did we just get this?

520
00:32:14,547 --> 00:32:17,704
Wait.
I'm getting something else.

521
00:32:19,491 --> 00:32:21,277
Look, I'm telling you I'm right.

522
00:32:21,402 --> 00:32:23,625
I know she was here.
She was standing right here.

523
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,528
I can see it plain as day... Right next
to the man who some believe to be

524
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,071
- her kidnapper.
- Sure?

525
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:32,060
As sure as I am that the guy
who just friended Gus online

526
00:32:32,185 --> 00:32:34,017
is not the guy who played R2-D2.

527
00:32:34,142 --> 00:32:35,526
His name is Kenny Baker.

528
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:37,551
Why would he
want to be friends with you?

529
00:32:37,676 --> 00:32:40,583
- Why would Elvira want to be friends?
- Her name is Cassandra Peterson.

530
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,167
We found Bekki's bracelet,

531
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,671
a few other belongings. She was indeed
here, so good work, Mr. Spencer.

532
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,840
- Thank you.
- Just a little late.

533
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:49,979
Chief, look at this.

534
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,720
- What is it?
- It's traces of blood.

535
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,629
You were here.

536
00:33:00,754 --> 00:33:03,318
You had to go out and play psychic,
now the girl might be dead.

537
00:33:03,443 --> 00:33:05,209
There are a lot of things in play.

538
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:07,773
She didn't get kidnapped.
She ran off with the guy.

539
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:10,530
She's in love with a dragon triad,
And here's the kicker...

540
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,920
Guess who the leader
of the golden triads is.

541
00:33:13,045 --> 00:33:14,468
Arthur Chiang.

542
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,261
- You knew that?
- Of course.

543
00:33:16,386 --> 00:33:19,997
Cops tried to nail him for years. Why
do you think I wanted you off this case?

544
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:23,375
- Do not say you're protecting me.
- I wasn't protecting you.

545
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,943
But these are seriously
dangerous people, Shawn.

546
00:33:26,068 --> 00:33:28,388
Dad, you're not listening
to me. I've got this.

547
00:33:28,513 --> 00:33:30,591
It's Romeo and Juliet,
West Side story.

548
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,885
I don't know which one is the jets
or the dolphins.

549
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,387
- Sharks.
- That is all that is going on here.

550
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,097
And how do you know all this?

551
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:39,996
- She told me.
- She told you. Ah.

552
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,895
Any chance she said it under duress?

553
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:44,528
I caught them kissing.

554
00:33:44,653 --> 00:33:46,273
Ah.
Did he have a gun?

555
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,497
I'm assuming not.

556
00:33:47,622 --> 00:33:50,268
That's exactly
what I'm talking about, Shawn.

557
00:33:50,393 --> 00:33:52,234
You got played, kid.
What?

558
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:54,573
Now go home.
You've done enough.

559
00:33:56,694 --> 00:33:58,194
That doesn't even...

560
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,060
I know what I saw.

561
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:03,507
- They lied to us.
- They didn't lie.

562
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:05,839
Maybe they were in it together.
They needed money.

563
00:34:05,964 --> 00:34:08,520
They fleeced you because you're
either romantic or stupid.

564
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:10,381
I know when people are in love.

565
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,174
What now?

566
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,885
You know Romeo and Juliet, right?
DiCaprio and Danes?

567
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,096
- It's a play too.
- Sure it is.

568
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:20,233
What if I said Bekki Chiang got mixed up
with the triads, the golden ones,

569
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,435
and fell in love with a dragon?
She didn't get kidnapped.

570
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,813
She's out there making
kissy face with her guy pal.

571
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,398
There's a ransom note.

572
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,942
Aha!
You are following the case.

573
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:32,444
Only enough to know
that you're wrong.

574
00:34:34,294 --> 00:34:35,913
Really?
If it's not a kidnapping,

575
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:37,281
why did we just get his?

576
00:34:37,716 --> 00:34:38,916
Wait a minute.

577
00:34:39,673 --> 00:34:42,623
That was no ransom note.
No money was asked for.

578
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:44,429
I don't follow you.

579
00:34:44,581 --> 00:34:47,850
That doesn't make any sense. Why would
he send a photo that'sincite a panic?

580
00:34:47,975 --> 00:34:49,204
- Who's he?
- Romeo.

581
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:50,546
- The son.
- The son?

582
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,339
- The Tan family.
- Which one?

583
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,258
- What do you mean?
- There are two.

584
00:34:54,582 --> 00:34:56,074
- Two?
- Two sons.

585
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:59,847
This is Sang Tan.
He's number two in the gang.

586
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,476
Now, this is the other brother.

587
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:06,562
- Which one did you meet?
- I met them both.

588
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,331
Teno is an enforcer.
He's somewhere in the middle.

589
00:35:09,456 --> 00:35:11,415
This guy's the toughest member
of the crew.

590
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,938
Why isn't he next in line?
He's a big problem.

591
00:35:14,063 --> 00:35:16,822
He crosses territorial lines.
This guy likes to poke the bear.

592
00:35:17,551 --> 00:35:21,289
Goldens and Dragons have been at peace.
This guy has inciting troubles.

593
00:35:21,414 --> 00:35:23,749
The only reason Teno
makes sense as a leader

594
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:26,081
is in a time of war
between the triads.

595
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,417
And I don't see that happening
anytime soon.

596
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:33,087
Our relationship was discovered.
I had to get her safe.

597
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:34,347
I do.

598
00:35:34,472 --> 00:35:36,672
And I know who kidnapped the girl.

599
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,855
- Shawn, this is a bad idea.
- We got this. It's the brothers.

600
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,960
And I just realized what you do
when brothers are fighting.

601
00:35:48,085 --> 00:35:49,085
What?

602
00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:51,019
You tell their dad.

603
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:56,020
I can't believe you called a meeting
with the head of the dragon triads.

604
00:35:56,145 --> 00:35:57,395
Summit meeting.

605
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:01,367
It was easy after I revealed I had jaw
dropping information about his two sons.

606
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,076
- Just get to it.
- Hi, there...

607
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,830
Mr. Han Tan. Or,

608
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,251
is it Mr. Tan Han?

609
00:36:09,805 --> 00:36:11,143
See, I get confused,

610
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:13,796
because the back of Yao Ming's
Jersey says Yao, not Ming.

611
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:14,963
Shawn.

612
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,881
Let me start off by saying
I love ping-pong.

613
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,830
And general Chao's chicken.

614
00:36:19,955 --> 00:36:21,905
And your version of checkers.

615
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,119
I find your fire drills
to be immensely entertaining.

616
00:36:25,244 --> 00:36:26,558
Bowie's China girl...

617
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,056
- The naked version.
- That goes without saying.

618
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:31,605
I have also practiced
the ancient martial art

619
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:33,433
of wushu...

620
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:35,776
Under the tutelage
of your fine people.

621
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:39,196
- Shawn, get on with it.
- I am endearing myself to him.

622
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,614
Stop endearing.

623
00:36:42,218 --> 00:36:44,868
Your son wants to start a war
between the triads.

624
00:36:48,455 --> 00:36:49,455
Teno,

625
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,165
the mean one.

626
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,284
Maybe you have your own way
of differentiating them, but for me,

627
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,171
I think he's the meanest.

628
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,439
Maybe it's the tattoo
or just the general demeanor.

629
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:02,845
Use of brow. Sometimes you just
get a vibe about someone.

630
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,013
Shawn.

631
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,956
Hold that thought.

632
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:09,408
I don't think he speaks any English.

633
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:13,216
Thank God.
I thought it was just me.

634
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:14,439
What do we do?

635
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:17,843
I have set plan "b", And until then,
we're just gonna have to use

636
00:37:17,968 --> 00:37:21,822
an international communication method.
You're not going to attempt charades.

637
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,840
- One word!
- Oh, my gosh.

638
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:29,246
<i>West Side Story.</i>

639
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:32,024
- That's three words.
- Your son Sang...

640
00:37:32,331 --> 00:37:35,133
The nice one, dark sweatshirt,

641
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,234
is in love
with Mr. Chiang's daughter.

642
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:40,716
- Also nice.
- Very nice.

643
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,177
Here's the part you won't like.

644
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,739
She is pregnant, preggers,

645
00:37:47,646 --> 00:37:49,391
with your grandbaby.

646
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,809
There is a Chinese bun in the oven.

647
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,440
She's actually not showing yet.
There's not a bump at all.

648
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,734
Safe to say that we're
in the 1st trimester.

649
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:01,764
- Shawn, this is not working.
- I am working my butt off.

650
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:03,447
He's giving me nothing!

651
00:38:04,297 --> 00:38:06,992
Don't worry.
I can hear plan "b" right outside.

652
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,360
I didn't do anything, man.
What are you people doing?

653
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,749
Go suck yourselves.

654
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:16,043
Thank God you're here, Ken.

655
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:18,420
- Why am I here?
- We need a translator.

656
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,589
- We solved the case.
- But we can't tell anybody.

657
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,716
And they can't understand
what we're saying.

658
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,049
Dude, I speak nine words of Chinese.

659
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,054
Six of those are numbers.

660
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,900
Let's not panic. We can use this.

661
00:38:29,025 --> 00:38:30,766
Which numbers do you know?
Enough!

662
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:33,615
I understand you.

663
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:34,812
You do?

664
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:36,735
Man, you let...

665
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:40,711
Mr. Han... Tan... Han...

666
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:46,498
You have spent ten long years

667
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:48,561
working very hard to keep peace

668
00:38:48,686 --> 00:38:51,570
between yourself
and the golden triads.

669
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:54,669
And your son Teno
wants to rip it apart.

670
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:59,009
If you know where he is,
you have to tell us.

671
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:02,496
If I'm found
with the kidnapped girl...

672
00:39:03,495 --> 00:39:05,495
The bloodshed will never stop.

673
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,611
- We cannot get involved.
- Right.

674
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:12,629
But we can.

675
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:16,728
So if you know where he is,

676
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,050
you got to give him up.

677
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,072
I'm about to solve a kidnapping.
I need you to bring backup.

678
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,616
- Shawn, call Lassiter.
- Nope. Not doing it.

679
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,451
- Stop it. I am not coming.
- Nope.

680
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,288
It's got to be you. Listen, Jules...
Yin came after me too, okay?

681
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,860
<i>I'm not gonna let this guy
keep me from living. I need you,</i>

682
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,451
or I go down alone.

683
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:41,670
Well, with Gus.
You know what I mean.

684
00:39:54,252 --> 00:39:56,635
- You all right?
- He's just outside.

685
00:39:56,952 --> 00:39:59,688
Wake up. Wake up.
We need you. Wake up, Sang.

686
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,107
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to wake him up.

687
00:40:02,232 --> 00:40:04,735
- We need him to help us escape.
- I've got us covered.

688
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,237
Don't say it, Shawn.
You are not a kung fu expert.

689
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,947
Technically, no, not yet.

690
00:40:09,072 --> 00:40:11,850
But I didn't show you this, man.

691
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:14,353
These are mostly just stretches,

692
00:40:15,056 --> 00:40:18,062
but there's some lethal
combinations here on page three.

693
00:40:19,565 --> 00:40:22,044
Teno...
We got you.

694
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,630
- I figured it all out.
- Really?

695
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:27,984
Yeah, really.

696
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:30,761
You felt betrayed
by your brother here, right?

697
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,171
More than that, you were jealous

698
00:40:33,296 --> 00:40:35,307
that you weren't selected
to take over.

699
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,710
See, Sang's a little soft
in your eyes, isn't he?

700
00:40:39,474 --> 00:40:40,674
Unfit to lead.

701
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,328
But a war between the triads,

702
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:47,897
that would be
your opportunity to shine...

703
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,571
Teno, the enforcer.

704
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,416
You knew who it was the night
we left, isn't that right?

705
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,461
<i>- This is the guy that's stealing stuff.
- the safe was already open.</i>

706
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:58,968
<i>Which he didn't have to crack,
which means he's a pro.</i>

707
00:40:59,093 --> 00:41:01,166
<i>And he stole a jacket,
a weird thing to steal.</i>

708
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:03,828
You were the one
who discovered that your brother

709
00:41:03,953 --> 00:41:06,838
was consorting
with your most hated enemy.

710
00:41:07,672 --> 00:41:09,173
<i>Our relationship was discovered.</i>

711
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:10,967
And we led you right to him.

712
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:12,970
He's right behind us!

713
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,643
You broke into that room, and you took
matters into your own hands.

714
00:41:23,544 --> 00:41:26,652
'cause luckily kidnapping
fell right in your lap.

715
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,028
And all you had to do
was snap a ransom photo,

716
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:35,158
make up enough evidence to put the blame
on your brother there, and wait.

717
00:41:36,378 --> 00:41:39,478
Wait for a war that you had
always wanted to start.

718
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,175
Oh, relax, dude.

719
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,170
Whoa. With the mouth.

720
00:41:47,556 --> 00:41:51,341
Dude, I have made it through
all seven levels of Shaq Fu on Nintendo.

721
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,926
And Gus can attest to that.

722
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:54,678
Sang, wake up.

723
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:57,514
All right, let's do this.

724
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:06,904
I execute this properly,
no can defend.

725
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,420
You got it, Shawn.
You got it.

726
00:42:26,785 --> 00:42:28,336
Help is on the way!

727
00:42:28,745 --> 00:42:30,345
Any minute now, Shawn.

728
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:34,082
Your sensei teach you
how to fight with a stick?

729
00:42:36,438 --> 00:42:37,988
Be like water, Shawn!

730
00:42:42,225 --> 00:42:43,476
I got your back, Shawn!

731
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,480
Crouching tiger, Shawn,
crouching tiger!

732
00:42:55,884 --> 00:42:57,984
Help is coming!
Help is coming!

733
00:42:58,618 --> 00:42:59,993
Fists of fury!

734
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,620
Fists of fury!

735
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:03,705
Wushu finger!

736
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,833
You're not helping!

737
00:43:12,371 --> 00:43:13,298
I'm coming.

738
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:33,709
Oh, man.

739
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,073
Really?

740
00:43:44,515 --> 00:43:46,498
Oh.
Good work, Jules.

741
00:43:46,944 --> 00:43:49,459
Yeah, he had just surrendered
before you got here.

742
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,005
He surrendered
when I walked in, Shawn.

743
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:56,883
Oh, God.

744
00:44:00,884 --> 00:44:03,256
You know, dad, none of this
would have happened

745
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:06,309
If you just had let me
take karate lessons as a kid.

746
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,144
But you know what?
I get it.

747
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,938
You saw that I had
too much potential.

748
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:13,256
You knew that I would be
way too dangerous to train.

749
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:16,736
I didn't let you take karate because
you had zero control of your body.

750
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,321
I had too much control.

751
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,449
You used to run around karate-chopping
everything in the house.

752
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,305
- I thought you'd kill yourself.
- All right. Agree to disagree.

753
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:27,139
But know this. From now on,
I can handle the rough stuff.

754
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,714
I'm my own person.
My body's a weapon.

755
00:44:30,244 --> 00:44:31,751
I don't need you to protect me.

756
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,019
Fair enough.

757
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:37,334
But in return, you never put me
in a position of having to lie for you.

758
00:44:37,685 --> 00:44:40,786
This isn't just about you anymore, kid.
I'm in this game too.

759
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:43,221
You find a victim,
you find a perpetrator,

760
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:45,432
you call me before you
put your hand to your head.

761
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,725
- First?
- First.

762
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,843
- How about first-ish?
- No!

763
00:44:49,638 --> 00:44:50,462
Thanks.

764
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,651
I was about to say
the same thing to you.

765
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:56,237
- Maybe I needed a kick in the pants.
- I would never kick you in the pants.

766
00:44:56,362 --> 00:44:58,987
- You didn't give up.
- And I'll never give up.

767
00:44:59,904 --> 00:45:02,104
What do you think?
Should we hug?

768
00:45:02,872 --> 00:45:03,783
We could.

769
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,244
There you are.

770
00:45:06,553 --> 00:45:08,603
- Rain check.
- There you are.

771
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:12,584
Chief said you were working on aproject.
Thought you could work on these too.

772
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,802
You're going to ply me
with additional work?

773
00:45:14,927 --> 00:45:17,547
- Carlton, these are your taxes.
- Hey, I'm trying to help you.

774
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,299
And this is how you help me?

775
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,885
Well, you're here.
It's already working.

776
00:45:25,018 --> 00:45:26,452
My spine might be liquid.

777
00:45:26,577 --> 00:45:29,134
Did you tell the cops
you single-handedly took out Teno Tan?

778
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,717
That was an assumptionthey made.

779
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:33,104
- From what?
- I may have left out two verbs,

780
00:45:33,229 --> 00:45:35,207
an adjective, and the words
"Juliet arrived."

781
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:37,075
But it was mostly facts.

782
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,345
- You have to sign your statement.
- Not if we leave right now.

783
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,936
- How about some panda express?
- Had that last night.

784
00:45:43,061 --> 00:45:44,517
- Pick up stix?
- This morning.

785
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:47,192
- P.F. Chang's?
- You know that's right.

786
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:51,790
52, take two. A-mark.

787
00:45:52,664 --> 00:45:53,664
Roll.

788
00:46:09,942 --> 00:46:12,092
Gus, those are cleaning supplies.

789
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:14,269
One more time.

790
00:46:18,933 --> 00:46:20,485
Let's go back and do that again.

791
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,632
He assumed. I called this
from a mile away.

792
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,957
Holy crap.
You're doing good cop.

793
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,055
We can do this the easy way or...

794
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,674
You must be out of your damn...

795
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:12,459
We can do this the easy way or...

796
00:47:13,044 --> 00:47:14,914
You must be out of your damn...

797
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,805
- What are we waiting?
- Seatbelt.

798
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,299
Oh, for crying...
just... just start the...

799
00:47:29,551 --> 00:47:30,930
That's all we need, right?
