1
00:00:02,409 --> 00:00:04,780
Look I'm telling you,
my son Shawn did not

2
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:06,300
have a permission to go
on that field trip.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,303
Well, he did turn in his
permission slip signed by you.

4
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:13,200
Signature's a forgery.
It's a fake.

5
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:16,198
Well, that's a little dramatic,
don't you think, Mr. Spencer?

6
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,822
Look, this form is a counterfeit.
These are serious charges.

7
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,237
And my son needs to be punished.

8
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:26,916
Mr. Spencer... all three are permission
slips also signed by you.

9
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:29,671
Yes.

10
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:31,640
Yes.

11
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:35,399
- Yes, those... those are my signatures.
- Well, you see, then?

12
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:38,656
I'd be hard-pressed to believe
that a child of Shawn's age

13
00:00:38,694 --> 00:00:40,761
could be capable
of such detailed forgery.

14
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:42,350
Well, you don't know my son.

15
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:45,444
No offense, but you are the vice
principal of a middle school,

16
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:46,924
not a handwriting expert.

17
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:48,769
That testimony's not gonna
hold up in court.

18
00:00:48,856 --> 00:00:53,099
Well, we're not talking court.
Are we?

19
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:57,436
You know, 'cause if we were,
you should know that I did take

20
00:00:57,459 --> 00:01:00,144
a handwriting personality course
at the Learning Annex last summer.

21
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:04,351
And I can tell by the way you, uh,
turn your N humps

22
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:07,941
that you have a very open
and childlike kindness about you.

23
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:11,626
I could be off on that.

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,306
You know, it... it was
a one-night seminar.

25
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:16,162
Okay... now, as a sergeant
with the Santa Barbara

26
00:01:16,217 --> 00:01:18,317
Police Department, let me tell you
what I know.

27
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:21,596
See the pen lift on the R there?

28
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:24,894
The bleed mark... that shows
hesitation, as if thinking, "Gee.

29
00:01:25,182 --> 00:01:27,171
How do I form that next letter?"

30
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:29,320
Now I don't know about you,
but I don't have to think

31
00:01:29,353 --> 00:01:33,132
about how to sign my own damn name...
So you're wrong.

32
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:35,971
Really?
I don't know, Dad.

33
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:40,241
I think Mr. Petlic has a point.
They look pretty identical to me.

34
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:51,378
Hey, check it out.
There's Lassiter.

35
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:56,456
Make a loop like a bunny's ear, wrap
it around, careful as you steer...

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,953
That's a good boy, Lassie.

37
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,597
Wait a minute. You're not Lassie.

38
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:05,951
Well, I don't know what a Lassie is,
but I'm not it.

39
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:07,851
I'm Special Agent Lars Ewing
with the FTD.

40
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:11,022
- You're a special florist?
- Federal Treasury Department.

41
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:13,182
We have a department that deals
exclusively with treasures?

42
00:02:13,204 --> 00:02:15,590
If you'll excuse me, I have
a meeting in an...

43
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,611
Interim Chief Vick's office.

44
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,219
That's where our meeting is!
This is very exciting.

45
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:21,578
I feel nervous.

46
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:22,733
Is that what you're wearing?

47
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:25,373
This goes against every federal bone
in my body, but who are you guys?

48
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:27,566
I'm not familiar with
the federal bone.

49
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:29,456
Is that connected to
the hip bone or the knee bone?

50
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,224
Well, I can tell you what the
knee bone is gonna connect with

51
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:33,368
- if you don't get out of my way.
- I'm gonna guess.

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,507
Not the funny bone?

53
00:02:38,974 --> 00:02:41,427
- This meeting is bigger than we thought.
- Yeah.

54
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:50,883
Get us some seats close to the desk,
but not on the side.

55
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:53,430
I'll catch up in a second.

56
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:03,369
Waiting for Godot?

57
00:03:04,657 --> 00:03:05,668
Guffman.

58
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:09,101
Waiting to exhale?

59
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:11,955
I'm not waiting to exhale.

60
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,621
- Shawn Spencer.
- Lindsay Leikin.

61
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:18,308
I'm the head psychic
in the department. This is...

62
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:20,351
- sort of my joint.
- They, um...

63
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:24,318
- hire psychics around here?
- Personally, I'm a little bit skeptical.

64
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:26,400
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

65
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:29,215
I was just getting
a very strong vibration. Did you...

66
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,669
did you just recently
take up the guitar?

67
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:35,659
Oh, my God.
Yes, just recently.

68
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:38,158
Very impressive.
How did you do that?

69
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:41,036
Sometimes there's just this
amazingly strong connection

70
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:44,163
from the word go.
I'm getting something else.

71
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:46,937
This is gonna be a very,
very good week for you,

72
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:49,290
- Lindsay Leikin.
- Really, I...

73
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:52,308
- didn't think...
- Just... let it happen.

74
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:59,193
So let me officially welcome you
to Santa Barbara.

75
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:01,348
We are all ready
and willing to...

76
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:03,519
Don't let me interrupt.
Please continue.

77
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,065
What'd I say about seats
on the side?

78
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,397
Mr. Spencer, this is
Special Agent Ewing

79
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:08,971
from the Treasury Department
in Washington.

80
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:11,148
Yes, we sniffed one another
in the hallway.

81
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:15,151
He is here because
they have been tracking

82
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:17,449
an aggressive forger who's been
counterfeiting large numbers

83
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:20,161
of $100 bills and then
laundering the money

84
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:21,576
into small communities
across the country.

85
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,316
The last being a Home Depot right here
in the heart of your little hamlet.

86
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,957
Well, we are raring to help you
with this federal bust.

87
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:29,160
Who is this?

88
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:31,740
This is Carlton Lassiter,
our head detective,

89
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:34,038
and his junior partner,
Juliet O'Hara.

90
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,931
Ah, the name Juliet.

91
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:38,693
"How silver-sweet sound
lovers' tongues by night. "

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,913
Shakespeare. Romeo and Juliet.

93
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,067
"Tootie,

94
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,415
you in trouble. "

95
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,060
It's Mindy Cohn.
Facts of Life.

96
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:51,298
Could you gentlemen
please state your name once again?

97
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:52,745
And please speak clearly.

98
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:55,785
Is that a recording device?
Government issued?

99
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,796
Asking if that
is a recording device

100
00:04:57,829 --> 00:04:59,917
is like asking if this
is a pen.

101
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,891
- Is it a pen?
- That's classified.

102
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:06,548
It's tiny.

103
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,619
- Probably can't hold much.
- Oh, that's not a tape recorder.

104
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:12,249
That is a high-tech microphone system
attached to a Mildred.

105
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:14,186
A Mildred?
What's... what's a Mildred?

106
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,025
I believe it's an
intelligence-gathering device.

107
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:19,229
"Mildred" is probably an anagram.
Military Intel Listening Device

108
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,828
Recorder... something.

109
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:23,280
Mildred is not a device.
She's my stenographer.

110
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,753
You have your own stenographer?

111
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:28,885
I am hyper-careful.
Can't take any chances.

112
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:32,269
Saved my behind more than once
in making cases stick past deposition.

113
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:34,839
- Brilliant. Chief?
- Not happening.

114
00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:37,584
Now what I need from all of you
is your full cooperation

115
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:40,745
in assisting Special Agent Ewing
in any way he sees fit.

116
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,187
- Now, any questions?
- I have a question for Special.

117
00:05:43,486 --> 00:05:45,657
- Who is this?
- I'm sorry.

118
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,420
This is Shawn Spencer.
And his partner, Burton Guster.

119
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:50,591
Mr. Spencer is a psychic
with the department

120
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:51,917
who I thought might be helpful.

121
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:55,110
Well, next time I have to go on a
panty raid, I'll give him a call.

122
00:05:55,696 --> 00:05:57,723
But we already have our own psychic.

123
00:05:57,793 --> 00:06:01,108
She's just started in the department
and she is already a superstar.

124
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:04,558
Got us so close to the counterfeiter
a month ago in Wilmette, Illinois.

125
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:06,525
We must have missed him
by only a few minutes.

126
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,315
- Mr. Spencer,
- Lindsay... Leikin.

127
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:13,685
- We too met in the hallway.
- Okay, then

128
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:15,088
let's adjourn this meeting.

129
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:19,491
I know Special Agent Ewing has prepared
informational packets for all of you.

130
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:25,032
- We will meet at the Home Depot tomorrow.
- Let's say... 0700 hours.

131
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,816
- 700 hours is almost 20 days.
- Shouldn't we act sooner?

132
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,794
- 0700 is 7:00 a. m.
- Precisely, Detective.

133
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:34,479
- Striking and whip-smart. Intriguing.
- I knew that too.

134
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:36,669
You have Pennsylvania Ave.
Running through your veins.

135
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:39,283
Ever consider taking the Bureau exam?

136
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:41,283
I have.

137
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:44,321
Let me set up that conference
area for you.

138
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,465
Right this way.

139
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,271
Little skeptical of psychics, are we?

140
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:49,708
I should have said "just you. "

141
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,156
And don't think I didn't pick up on
that calluses on my hands guitar clue.

142
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:56,039
Good one. This is gonna be good.

143
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:59,286
I'm gonna solve this case,
and I'm gonna prove you're a fake.

144
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:00,510
Fun, right?

145
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:07,553
Psych 203 : "Psy vs Psy"

146
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,999
Synchro: Flolo et Arbu
www.forom.com 

147
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,600
Okay, you are all instructed to cooperate
fully with the federal agents.

148
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:19,685
I'll be damned if we're gonna get
shown up on our own turf.

149
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:22,906
They may be the feds, but we are
a team and this is our town.

150
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:24,597
They will need us.

151
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:27,669
You breached protocol, Leikin.
I waited outside the hotel, 0630.

152
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:29,277
- You weren't there.
- Yeah, sorry.

153
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:31,233
I got up early and went
to go get coffee.

154
00:07:32,194 --> 00:07:33,774
Son, let me ask you a question.

155
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:36,228
What made you think those
$100 bills were authentic?

156
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:38,838
Um, 'cause they said "100" on them.

157
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:42,422
Are you an idiot?
Don't answer that.

158
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,963
If I plopped a Granny Smith apple
down on this counter

159
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,344
and carved a "100" on it, would you
accept that as legal tender?

160
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,697
Don't answer that.
Do you know what microprinting is?

161
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:54,311
- I'm confused. Should I answer that?
- I know what it is.

162
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:57,916
The introduction of microprinting
as an anti-replicant feature

163
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:03,007
began in 1990 with the addition
of the words "United States of America"

164
00:08:03,113 --> 00:08:05,107
printearound
Ben Franklin's lapel.

165
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,770
In addition, the words
"U.S. 100" are printed

166
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:10,032
within the lines
of the lower left 100.

167
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:13,494
I'm sorry... is it just me,
or is this unbearably boring?

168
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:17,137
I don't know how Ms. Leikin works,
but Gus and I

169
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:19,688
are going to investigate
the body of the store

170
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:25,224
and search for our culprit's
twisted, wretched, filthy aura.

171
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,587
Because that is what
serious psychics do.

172
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,387
Shawn. What are you doing?

173
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:41,652
- Shawn?
- Dad.

174
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:44,200
Wow, you look so tiny
down there.

175
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,769
What the hell are you doing
up there?

176
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:48,440
What does it look like I'm doing?
We're making a case.

177
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,253
- A federal one.
- Oh, of course you are.

178
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,778
Well, when you've finished
wrapping things up

179
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,400
for the Pentagon, I want you at my house.
I got a project for you.

180
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,346
Afraid we're gonna be
a little busy having our pictures

181
00:08:58,391 --> 00:09:01,661
taken with the President of the
United States of America.

182
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,145
Mm, oh, I think you'll be there.

183
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:05,776
- You owe me.
- I owe you?

184
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:08,837
Yeah, for the last 12 times I helped
you solve one of your little cases...

185
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:10,632
- you agreed.
- Gus, did I agree to that?

186
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:13,268
Well, technically...
I think you did.

187
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:17,511
See ya.

188
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:31,248
- Excuse me. Can I help you guys?
- Hello, Garrison.

189
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:32,717
We're working
on the counterfeiting case.

190
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:35,480
And we need to see all of
yesterday's security footage.

191
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:37,900
How do you know my name's Garrison?

192
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:41,165
You thought this was
gonna be a problem?

193
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,527
I'm sorry, man. I... I didn't
mean to freak you out.

194
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:47,003
My name is Shawn Spencer. I'm a
psychic with the police department.

195
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:51,213
There was already a psychic here
last night. From Washington, no less.

196
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,233
She looked at all the tapes
and there was no positive ID.

197
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:55,954
She already came here, huh?

198
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:59,459
And she's good.
She also knew my name was Garrison.

199
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,762
Uh, you mind if I take a peek anyway?
I work a little differently than her.

200
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:06,003
My process is a little more complex.

201
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:09,633
I can sometimes pick up images
that are underneath the...

202
00:10:09,847 --> 00:10:12,900
- epidermal layer.
- Here it is.

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,642
This is the tape of the counterfeiter
that she looked at last night.

204
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:18,570
You know, honestly,
if that pretty lady psychic

205
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,877
couldn't pick up anything, I can't
imagine you're gonna have much luck.

206
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:24,535
You know what, you're probably right.
We gave it a shot.

207
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:25,872
Thanks, Garrison.

208
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:30,981
Tall? Short?
Age? Race?

209
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:32,269
Do you mean to tell me
that the only thing

210
00:10:32,302 --> 00:10:34,191
you can remember clearly
is that he was a man?

211
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,352
And technically, I can't even
be sure of that, now, can I?

212
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:40,054
Wait. I'm getting something.

213
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:45,159
- He... did not wear corrective lenses.
- Actually, that is true.

214
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:48,621
Okay, well, that's something to go on.
Good work, Mr. Spencer.

215
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,660
Great... and so we're looking
for someone in Santa Barbara

216
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:56,386
- who does not wear glasses.
- He... He had a small scar...

217
00:10:57,122 --> 00:10:58,823
about three inches,
on the jaw line.

218
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:04,503
And... he wore a single stud
diamond in his left ear.

219
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:06,779
Yes. And yes.

220
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:10,719
She's exactly right.
I can see that clearly now.

221
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,419
That's why she's the best.

222
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:21,804
Tough break.

223
00:11:22,544 --> 00:11:24,445
Wh... Jules...

224
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,544
Dad, I'm confused.
There are plans for a wet bar.

225
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,554
Yeah, that's right.
For entertaining.

226
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,796
Right, but I don't see anywhere in
the plans the portal into 1976.

227
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,459
Shawn, a wet bar happens to be
a timeless home feature.

228
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:44,161
Right, perfect for those warm
summer evenings when Reggie Jackson

229
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:46,968
and Dyan Cannon swing by
for Harvey Wallbangers.

230
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:49,671
Shawn. Are you gonna crack wise
or are you gonna get to work?

231
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:52,013
I feel like it should be noted
that neither Gus nor myself

232
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:54,492
- are licensed plumbers.
- Yes, I understand that, Shawn.

233
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:55,619
I've already installed the sink.

234
00:11:55,652 --> 00:11:58,592
All you two have to do
is connect the fittings.

235
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:03,281
All right.

236
00:12:03,816 --> 00:12:05,374
- Let's get to work.
- Seriously?

237
00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:07,410
- This will be good.
- It will?

238
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:08,411
Work is good, Gus.

239
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:10,917
Work is glorious.
It's the breath of life.

240
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,867
- What is this?
- It's a drill.

241
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:15,370
Of course it is.
Don't be ridiculous.

242
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:18,199
You're still upset that Lindsay showed
you up at the crime scene, aren't you?

243
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:19,428
What is her trick?

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,400
- Maybe she's just more psychic-y than you.
- Gus, don't be ridiculous.

245
00:12:23,437 --> 00:12:25,459
- There's no such thing as psychics.
- I don't know, Shawn.

246
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,874
Even I've been getting
a little bit of intuition lately.

247
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,869
In fact, I'm getting something
right now. Something very strong.

248
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:34,692
She's... she's...
better than you.

249
00:12:34,803 --> 00:12:36,825
You know, they say imitation
is the greatest form

250
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:38,007
of flattery, but that hurts.

251
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:40,259
- It hurts below the belt.
- Shawn, if you want to beat her,

252
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,976
then we have to actually
work the case.

253
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:44,850
Utilize my knowledge.
You know I have a coin collection.

254
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:46,352
I've studied tender
from around the world.

255
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,976
I have over 85 Buffalo
nickels, Shawn.

256
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:50,389
Okay.

257
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,236
First of all, and this is key,
don't ever, under any circumstances,

258
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:57,449
ever admit that to anyone
outside of these walls.

259
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:59,726
Secondly, I love utilizing
your knowledge, Gus.

260
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,223
I can't wait until we have
the case of the missing thimble.

261
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:04,632
But this case is not about
counterfeiting.

262
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:08,389
It's about me versus her.
Ecks versus Sever.

263
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:12,790
- Joe versus the Volcano.
- Fine. Then let's get to it.

264
00:13:13,064 --> 00:13:15,495
- What do you know?
- All right, this is what I got.

265
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:18,912
He managed not to be identified
on any of the security cameras,

266
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:20,073
which means he's smart.

267
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:21,738
Smart enough to stay
ahead of the game.

268
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,193
Which means changing up anything that
could be linked or traced to him.

269
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:28,160
Like his vehicle. His key.
It was distinctively Nissan.

270
00:13:28,237 --> 00:13:30,674
Probably a Murano.
Maybe a Sentra.

271
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:33,188
So we go back and check
the outdoor surveillance cameras

272
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:34,961
from the store, and look for Nissans

273
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:36,789
- in the parking lot yesterday.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

274
00:13:36,822 --> 00:13:37,728
I already tipped Lassiter off
to that.

275
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:40,485
The only one that didn't check out
was a new one with no plates.

276
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,656
Ewing's informational packet
links this guy

277
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:44,689
to over a dozen vehicles
since he left Washington.

278
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:46,888
His pattern's to spend
six to eight days

279
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,498
in a town before pricking up ears.

280
00:13:48,575 --> 00:13:51,254
- You read Ewing's informational packet?
- Cover to cover.

281
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,475
That's weird.
I just read the cover.

282
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:55,121
But I don't need
to read the whole thing

283
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:56,336
to know that that's his M.O.

284
00:13:56,407 --> 00:13:58,363
He's too smart to still be
driving that car, Gus.

285
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:00,583
He's gotta be switching out
his mode of transportation

286
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:02,478
- on a daily basis.
- And paying cash.

287
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,644
Gotta launder as much
of that funny money as he can.

288
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:07,583
So the question is, to which car
dealership would a crook go

289
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:11,038
to spend lots of cash
without pricking up ears?

290
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:18,852
This must be what Jay Leno
feels like when he walks

291
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:22,585
into his garage. Which makes
you Kevin Eubanks.

292
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:25,001
I don't think they roll
around town together, Shawn.

293
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,500
- Can we talk to the owner?
- First we play customer.

294
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,314
It's the people who groove
on the floor that are gonna

295
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:31,500
give us the scoop, Gus.

296
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,683
Excuse me, my buddy here
is interested

297
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:36,788
in the bana yellow Ferrari, though
he's neither gay nor European.

298
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:38,317
I hope that's not a prob...

299
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:40,803
Look who finally figured it out.

300
00:14:40,924 --> 00:14:42,129
Little late.

301
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,795
How did you not notice her, Shawn?

302
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,264
- I wasn't expecting her to be here.
- You were looking right at her

303
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,734
She's got me all out of whack.

304
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:00,883
- Get your head in the game.
- So what's going on?

305
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:01,844
No one calls us anymore.

306
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,962
That's the new thing?
I thought we were a team.

307
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,570
Yeah, first of all,
the whole "team" thing.

308
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,818
She wasn't talking to you.
And secondly, Ewing didn't call me.

309
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:09,825
He called O'Hara.

310
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:14,690
- It's not like I asked him to.
- It's okay, Clarice.

311
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:17,507
- You don't have to make excuses to us.
- It wasn't just today.

312
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:18,922
My phone's been ringing
all the time.

313
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:22,243
I don't know how he got my home number.
I mean, please.

314
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:24,712
Do you think I wanted to pick up
my phone at 2:00 a. m.

315
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:29,320
and hear his voice all gravelly
and masculine?

316
00:15:30,104 --> 00:15:31,917
Probably called from the hotel.

317
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:38,369
Maybe just got out of the shower or...
finished with a swim. Dripping wet.

318
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,058
Just catch Mr. Spencer and
Mr. Guster up

319
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:46,036
on what Ms. Leikin
was able to figure out.

320
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,868
Apparently our guy came in here,
bought a used Lamborghini

321
00:15:48,923 --> 00:15:52,337
- for $47,000 in cash.
- Next day, he tries to return it.

322
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:55,248
All sales are final, but the
sales manager makes a concession,

323
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:57,105
offering mere $26,000 in cash.

324
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,492
He accepts it?
What kind of idiot is this guy?

325
00:15:59,536 --> 00:16:01,292
A genius idiot,
according to the feds.

326
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:03,385
You see, those familiar
with this sort of thing

327
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:04,590
know that it's the classic grift.

328
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:07,120
Essentially, he traded 47 Gs
of worthless paper

329
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,474
for $26,000 in cold, hard cash.
I've seen it before.

330
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:13,049
- Where, in a Mamet play?
- Any witnesses?

331
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,744
No, but a Lamborghini
was spotted outside of town

332
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:18,042
in Goleta, but it was moving
too fast to make an ID.

333
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:19,832
You know, I don't think
he's a swimmer.

334
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,681
He's not really that build.
I bet he plays rugby.

335
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:25,351
Hey, what color is that suit?

336
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:27,213
- Black.
- Really?

337
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,271
- It seems blacker than black.
- It's Washington black.

338
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:33,591
Look, if anyone wants to join me,
I'm gonna be taking a look

339
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:36,056
at some of the bills from the safe
that didn't get deposited.

340
00:16:42,056 --> 00:16:45,597
Look, Leikin, I think it's possible
that we got off on the wrong foot.

341
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:47,602
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I mean, this is silly.

342
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:49,944
We should join forces
like Pitt and Jolie, you know?

343
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,436
Work together,
make it nice for everyone.

344
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,690
I don't think you get it.
I have nothing to gain here.

345
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,601
If you haven't noticed,
my job is safe.

346
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,461
It's you I'm worried about, faker.

347
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:01,047
- In that case, maybe we should just date.
- I'm seeing somebody.

348
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,683
- Well, is it...
- Serious?  Yes.

349
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:04,097
- You didn't know I was gonna...
- Yes, I did.

350
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,011
Dude, don't you know the move
where you take off

351
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:16,569
your jacket and you lay it
across some seats?

352
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:19,304
- Get your head in the game, Shawn.
- Uh, budgies?

353
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:24,720
These are good.
But they're not great.

354
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:28,687
You see how on this bill, the edge of
the nose on Ben Franklin's cloudy?

355
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,419
Did you get that, Mildred?

356
00:17:37,414 --> 00:17:40,265
Hey, is there any reason
a $100 bill would change colors?

357
00:17:40,353 --> 00:17:41,546
Actually, yes.

358
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:43,728
It's an effect caused
by color-shifting ink.

359
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:46,010
It's only present in $100 bills.

360
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:48,308
The changing color
is called color diffraction.

361
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:50,169
And it's made possible
when light reflects

362
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:52,503
off of metallic flakes
added to the ink.

363
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:00,158
- Good work, Gus.
- Thank you.

364
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:04,947
So we'll check the information that
Ms. Leikin's gathered for us...

365
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:07,980
Thank goodness!
Finally, some nice seats, huh?

366
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,721
This is what I'm talking about.

367
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:15,495
What?

368
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:18,484
Did I... did I just sit
in something?

369
00:18:19,158 --> 00:18:21,528
- Gus, do I have pudding on my jeans?
- No, no.

370
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:25,948
- Nothing?
- Shawn. I think we're not welcomed here.

371
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:28,202
Gus, don't be a paranoid
schizophrenic.

372
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:30,517
- We're always welcome here.
- No, look.

373
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:38,871
- Oh, my God. We're not welcome.
- It's nothing personal, Mr. Spencer.

374
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:41,324
Special Agent Ewing just
feels that Ms. Leiken

375
00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:43,036
has things covered
on the psychic front.

376
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:44,815
And I have to agree with him.

377
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,654
Okay.
Take a hint.

378
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,499
Certainly don't need
to be told twice.

379
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:51,979
I think you were just told
three times.

380
00:18:52,012 --> 00:18:54,167
You know what, this is fine,
because we had a good run.

381
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,801
Thank you for the memories.
Oh, just one more thing.

382
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,375
You might want to check
the cash from the dealership,

383
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,712
because it's not all counterfeit.

384
00:19:05,223 --> 00:19:06,450
That's ridiculous.

385
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:08,781
If I had learned how to laugh
as a child, I would right now.

386
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:11,224
I looked at all those bills myself.

387
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,649
Do you really want to go against
the leading special agent

388
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:18,795
in counterfeiting with 14 years
of experience under his belt

389
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:20,364
and say that those bills
weren't fake?

390
00:19:20,574 --> 00:19:22,648
Not all of them. Just one.

391
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:24,891
And I believe the serial
number was...

392
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,861
- ALD... 975... 7080... 7...
- 7!

393
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,842
Where are we going?

394
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:41,687
Shouldn't we have stayed until
they checked the bills out?

395
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:42,800
Wait for it.

396
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:45,076
Wait for it.

397
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:48,494
- Spencer. Hold up.
- The bill checked out. It's real.

398
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:54,078
All right.
Answer me this, Mr. Psychic.

399
00:19:54,222 --> 00:19:56,012
Why would a counterfeiter
ever  use real bills?

400
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:57,788
Because he had to

401
00:19:57,868 --> 00:20:01,315
Man... I read your informational
packet cover to cover.

402
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:05,053
Our guy spends six to eight days in
every city... we're only on day four.

403
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:07,208
Quite simply, he ran out of dough.

404
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:09,451
He didn't know what kind of deal
he'd be able to make on the car.

405
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:11,772
Turns out, short one bill.

406
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:14,118
- Lucky for us.
- So what's our next move?

407
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:15,460
Well, I'll call Washington
and begin...

408
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:17,341
I'm sorry, I was asking
Mr. Spencer.

409
00:20:17,728 --> 00:20:20,347
Oh... oh, you want to know
what I think his next move is.

410
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:21,849
Oh, Gus, look, she wants...

411
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:24,573
Well, let's see here.
He's gotta print more money.

412
00:20:24,584 --> 00:20:27,026
My guess is he, uh,
set up shop here in town.

413
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,899
So... we find his little nest,
we find him.

414
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:34,787
Well, buddy...
I really hope you like this.

415
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:39,373
It took me 19 hours to bake.
Put it in last night before bed.

416
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,472
It takes 19 hours to bake
a pineapple upside-down cake?

417
00:20:42,914 --> 00:20:45,433
It does when it's being heated
by a 60-watt bulb.

418
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:50,485
It's not upside down, Shawn.

419
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,319
Who could that be at this hour?

420
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,000
Are you gonna invite me in?

421
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:02,887
Eh... Uh... guess.

422
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,233
So this is what a psychic
detective office looks like.

423
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:08,860
You know, I always imagined it...

424
00:21:09,411 --> 00:21:11,110
Does something smell like pineapple?

425
00:21:11,152 --> 00:21:12,383
Pineapple upside-down cake.

426
00:21:12,482 --> 00:21:13,602
Would you like some?
Wait.

427
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:17,762
Before you answer that,
are you a fan of delicious flavor?

428
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,256
All right, look.

429
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:22,213
This isn't easy
for me to say, but...

430
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:25,292
I was wrong.
You're better than I thought.

431
00:21:25,504 --> 00:21:28,094
Your discovery at the station today
was a huge get.

432
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:30,287
I think we should
work together after all.

433
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:33,614
The faster we find out where
the counterfeiter's den is, the better.

434
00:21:34,012 --> 00:21:36,305
That is, if you guys are willing.

435
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,833
I don't know.

436
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,867
Depends. Don't you think, Gus?

437
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:44,644
Wait. I'm definitely getting something.

438
00:21:44,774 --> 00:21:45,793
Oh, this is good.

439
00:21:46,528 --> 00:21:48,775
It's a... it's a...
it's a transient location.

440
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:52,342
Uh, where people can come and
go anonymously, paying in cash.

441
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:53,665
And... and it's remote,

442
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,746
so they can print large sums of money on
a noisy printer without being heard.

443
00:21:56,803 --> 00:22:00,255
- Yes... yes, I'm getting that same thing.
- Yes?

444
00:22:00,327 --> 00:22:01,629
- And I see it.
- Yes?

445
00:22:01,685 --> 00:22:03,115
It's by a body of water.

446
00:22:05,017 --> 00:22:07,536
Really? It's by a body of water?

447
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:10,062
Leikin, that's amateur stuff.

448
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:12,071
You know what, I might
expect that from John Edwards.

449
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,193
Definitely from Miss Cleo.
But not from you.

450
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:15,226
- Leikin...
- Wait.

451
00:22:16,188 --> 00:22:19,372
I'm also...
I'm also getting something in French.

452
00:22:19,453 --> 00:22:20,720
A sign, maybe?

453
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,042
- Could it be a European hotel?
- Wait a minute.

454
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:24,235
She may be on to something.

455
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:26,625
I know this particular hotel.
It's on my sales route.

456
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:27,630
On a private beach...

457
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,776
- What?
- It's just... it's strange.

458
00:22:29,777 --> 00:22:31,892
I'm... I'm pretty familiar
with your route, Gus.

459
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,800
I don't recall any private beaches
with hotels on them.

460
00:22:34,843 --> 00:22:37,064
- What are you talking about, Shawn?
- Where was it you went last summer

461
00:22:37,093 --> 00:22:39,822
for the Pips autograph
signing convention?

462
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:41,103
- You met Gladys Knight?
- No.

463
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:42,902
- Just the Pips.
- Actually, a Pip.

464
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,605
The other two got stuck in traffic.
Look, I don't wanna talk about it.

465
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:47,940
The point is, it's been
under construction for months.

466
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,742
Which would account for the noise.
And it caters to Europeans.

467
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:53,563
- This could be the place.
- Sweet. We totally scored.

468
00:22:53,634 --> 00:22:57,005
But you couldn't have got that without
my transient location thing, am I right?

469
00:22:58,753 --> 00:22:59,757
I don't...

470
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:01,625
I don't think that cake is cooked.

471
00:23:05,742 --> 00:23:07,666
Listen, I need to know every guest...

472
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:09,598
...cashed in the last week.

473
00:23:09,726 --> 00:23:11,855
I'm sorry, who are you,
and what do you want?

474
00:23:11,898 --> 00:23:13,554
Special Agent Lars Ewing.

475
00:23:13,764 --> 00:23:15,263
Federal Treasury Department.

476
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:18,279
Head Detective Carlton Lassiter,
Santa Barbara Police Department.

477
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:21,639
Presidential Recommendation
for Distinguished Service.

478
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:23,777
Presidential Physical Fitness award.

479
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,014
Eighth, ninth, and tenth grade.
And I've got a cocktail napkin

480
00:23:26,015 --> 00:23:27,019
from Air Force One.

481
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:29,819
I personally arrested Ivan Boesky.

482
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:31,969
I wrestled in high school.

483
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:34,049
- What, with your conscience?
- That is it!

484
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,910
Look, we need to know who's paid
with cash or travelers checks recently.

485
00:23:40,508 --> 00:23:42,220
My God, you're a firecracker.

486
00:23:42,408 --> 00:23:44,715
It would probably be easier
to ask who didn't.

487
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:45,762
I'm sorry?

488
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:49,756
This is a hotel. We're a cash business.
Lots of European travelers.

489
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,374
With what foreign credit card companies
charge these days, cash is king.

490
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,817
The south tower, I see him.

491
00:23:56,015 --> 00:23:57,925
I see him in the south tower.

492
00:23:57,968 --> 00:23:59,284
How many rooms in the south tower?

493
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,026
There are 170.

494
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:03,231
All right, let's start banging on
some doors and call for backup.

495
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:04,859
If we tap every available
source of manpower,

496
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,797
we can have this thing done
18, 19 hours tops.

497
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:08,129
I can alert Washington right now

498
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,122
and have an 80-man SWAT team
on a C-130 Hercules.

499
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:12,233
They could be here in
less than three hours.

500
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:13,537
Filthy sheets!

501
00:24:13,943 --> 00:24:15,273
I see dirty, filthy sheets.

502
00:24:15,335 --> 00:24:17,840
Yes, and towels on the floor.

503
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,288
And a mediocre, half-eaten
turkey club sandwich.

504
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:23,760
And he's refused maid service.

505
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,109
Okay, what guest
refused maid service?

506
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:29,409
I might remind you we do cater
to a very European crowd.

507
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:31,087
He's isolated.

508
00:24:31,877 --> 00:24:34,958
He's in a less-desirable room
that's not facing the ocean.

509
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,614
Do you have any rooms
that face the parking lot?

510
00:24:36,745 --> 00:24:37,650
A few.

511
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:41,324
- He's in one of those.
- Let's see.

512
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:44,137
French woman.

513
00:24:44,521 --> 00:24:45,879
Another French party.

514
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,814
Here... here's a single gentleman.

515
00:24:48,815 --> 00:24:51,885
Paid all in cash.
Corner room facing the alley.

516
00:24:51,946 --> 00:24:55,512
And according to this, he's never taken
his "do not disturb" sign off his door.

517
00:24:56,023 --> 00:24:57,311
- Room number.
- Key!

518
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:00,747
Clear!

519
00:25:02,382 --> 00:25:04,533
Nice job, psychics,
let's get to work.

520
00:25:05,311 --> 00:25:07,364
That's a really cute front-loader.

521
00:25:08,012 --> 00:25:09,017
Thank you.

522
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:11,699
He prints the money, then he washes it
here to soften it.

523
00:25:11,922 --> 00:25:14,949
Then he tumbles it dry and beats it up
with stones to give it that...

524
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,718
natural, worn texture.

525
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,354
Dude, there's linen fibers
in that paper.

526
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:25,372
What was he doing,
amending the constitution?

527
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:28,759
You can't print money on regular
paper, Shawn. That's government-issue.

528
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:30,357
I'm getting a visual.

529
00:25:30,753 --> 00:25:33,710
He printed a batch of about 50.000,
which will last him a while.

530
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:35,931
Five bills a sheet, at least 80 sheets
missing from this ream

531
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:37,764
that sounds about right.
- Wait.

532
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:40,627
No, I'm getting more.
I'm getting a lot more.

533
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:44,670
Like 500.000, which would last
more than just a while.

534
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:46,459
Maybe... maybe a whole lifetime.

535
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,502
- That's not possible.
- It is if you live in one of

536
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:49,712
the Baltic states.

537
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:52,412
I'm just not getting that feeling...
at all.

538
00:25:52,572 --> 00:25:56,209
Anything over 50.000 is just getting
blocked from my receptors. Not a chance.

539
00:25:56,311 --> 00:25:59,014
Receptors? Really?

540
00:26:20,738 --> 00:26:21,742
This would do it.

541
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:24,212
This is a 500-sheet ream,
and it's likely he used it all.

542
00:26:25,557 --> 00:26:26,646
Treasury seal?

543
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:33,880
No.

544
00:26:37,414 --> 00:26:38,666
Passport seal.

545
00:26:40,135 --> 00:26:42,470
Uh, this guy's officially on the lam.

546
00:26:42,884 --> 00:26:45,558
We don't catch him now,
we can kiss him good-bye.

547
00:26:46,676 --> 00:26:49,429
The railway stations, obviously the
airport security has been notified,

548
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,221
and all the interstate
agencies are on alert.

549
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:52,333
They've all been given the sketch

550
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:54,240
based on Ms. Leikin's
description of the suspect.

551
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:57,221
Okay, but please keep your phones on
just in case we get any movement.

552
00:26:57,428 --> 00:27:00,372
What's the point? Nobody ever
bothers to call us anymore.

553
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,118
Shawn, I don't do this much,
but I just wanted to say thank you.

554
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:09,119
I know we haven't nailed him yet,
but you were right, we make a good team.

555
00:27:10,782 --> 00:27:12,084
Yes, we do.

556
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:14,122
And hopefully tomorrow
we'll wrap this thing up.

557
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:15,707
Have a good night.

558
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:21,219
Wait for it...

559
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:24,035
Wait for it.

560
00:27:24,295 --> 00:27:27,352
Shawn, I was thinking maybe
we could go somewhere now.

561
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:30,260
Maybe continue working to see
if we can't stumble upon some

562
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:31,265
collective apparition.

563
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,942
That's a fantastic idea.

564
00:27:33,022 --> 00:27:35,767
I love it. Where could we go at
this hour that's still open?

565
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:38,358
You know what, I think there's
a Color Me Mine that stays open late.

566
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,980
- You don't quit with the jokes, do you?
- I'm sorry, would you like me to stop?

567
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:43,977
Not yet.
I kinda like it.

568
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,964
But actually, I was thinking
back to my hotel room?

569
00:27:52,594 --> 00:27:55,863
You know, it's something we could try.

570
00:27:55,914 --> 00:27:59,707
I mean, it's not as much fun as making
ashtrays with our names on them, but...

571
00:28:00,201 --> 00:28:01,206
Yeah.

572
00:28:01,871 --> 00:28:03,569
I'm a flexible guy, a sportsman.

573
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,927
Good.

574
00:28:05,076 --> 00:28:08,366
All right, I'll head back to freshen up.
What do you say we meet at 2200 hours?

575
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,499
Perfect. Oh, I'm so rude.

576
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,957
Gus, buddy, would you like to join us?

577
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,472
- Well, I...
- That sucks,

578
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:16,090
so 2200 on the dot. I'll be there.

579
00:28:20,358 --> 00:28:22,934
Dude, what time is 2200 hours?

580
00:28:24,654 --> 00:28:26,040
Gus.

581
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,258
Buddy, help me out.

582
00:28:27,688 --> 00:28:30,524
What is it?
Is it, like, 11:00 times two?

583
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:31,783
Buddy!

584
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:45,202
So, tell me, Shawn. Are you planning on
doing psychic police work forever?

585
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:47,379
No.

586
00:28:48,638 --> 00:28:51,352
No, just until I find
the girl of my dreams.

587
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,986
And then I'll whisk her
off to Carmel and...

588
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:58,149
Open a small haberdashery...

589
00:28:59,353 --> 00:29:01,193
Do some macrame, maybe.

590
00:29:02,195 --> 00:29:03,709
Maybe blow some glass.

591
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:09,156
Well, as hot as that sounds, I think the
psychic world would miss your talents.

592
00:29:09,532 --> 00:29:11,343
Just make sure they appreciate you.

593
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:16,504
After a while, the world tends to take
people with our abilities for granted.

594
00:29:17,944 --> 00:29:20,670
Well, that's awfully easy
for you to say.

595
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:23,360
I mean, you've already met
your special someone...

596
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,187
Your handsome prince.

597
00:29:26,943 --> 00:29:29,702
You're serious with somebody, remember?

598
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,574
Actually, I...

599
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:36,967
recently had a change of heart.
- Really?

600
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,030
Would a certain psychic
have anything to do with that?

601
00:29:42,144 --> 00:29:44,011
Well, we do have quite a connection.

602
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:45,714
We do. It's...

603
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,766
It's like our minds are just
fused together, you know?

604
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:53,979
I feel like Holly Hunter
in Broadcast News, you know,

605
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,990
when she's inside
William Hurt's head?

606
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:58,072
Okay, let's try it.

607
00:29:59,803 --> 00:30:00,946
I'm thinking of something.

608
00:30:00,988 --> 00:30:03,309
- None... they don't bury the survivors.
- Yes, exactly.

609
00:30:03,337 --> 00:30:06,535
You have a favorite color,
and I'm seeing... sea foam green.

610
00:30:06,577 --> 00:30:08,762
Actually, it's blue, but
that is so near the green family.

611
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,821
- Pick a number between one and ten.
- Eight.

612
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,422
That's close enough.

613
00:30:21,784 --> 00:30:24,571
- You totally wanted me to do that.
- You totally read my mind.

614
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:29,562
o/~ Dissolve the nerves
that have just begun o/~

615
00:30:30,151 --> 00:30:32,713

Whoa, slow down.
What do you mean she took off... when?

621
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:48,273
You know, I don't know when.
She tricked me, okay?

622
00:30:48,322 --> 00:30:50,650
She clearly wants to take
all the credit for herself.

623
00:30:51,718 --> 00:30:53,968
Look, just... just meet me over here.

624
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,933
Oh, that's Lassie on the other line.
I gotta take it.

625
00:30:57,074 --> 00:30:59,409
- You're dropping me for Lassiter?
- Hurry up!

626
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:01,284
You wait till now to call us?

627
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,378
I called you as soon as I heard.
Do you think I want

628
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:05,310
Junior G-man here to
beat me to the punch.

629
00:31:08,537 --> 00:31:09,542
Thank you.

630
00:31:11,294 --> 00:31:13,841
Well, it's affirmative...
our counterfeiter.

631
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:16,354
Shot with his own gun...
there are signs of a struggle.

632
00:31:16,496 --> 00:31:19,274
Checks out as Steven J. Grabinski.
His only priors are a couple counts

633
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:21,772
of petty theft, and small-time
fraud in Washington.

634
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:25,850
He had a small scar, about three
inches on the jaw line, and...

635
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:29,743
He wore a single stud diamond
in his left ear.

636
00:31:31,283 --> 00:31:32,302
Damn, she's good.

637
00:31:40,118 --> 00:31:41,462
Whoa... touchy!

638
00:31:41,726 --> 00:31:43,722
I don't know how you do it
in Washington, but here,

639
00:31:43,723 --> 00:31:46,118
we don't disturb the body till
forensics has a chance to come in,

640
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:48,198
collect some evidence.
- Lassiter, ease up.

641
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:50,671
We're lucky if our psychic
doesn't lick the body.

642
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,775
Well...

643
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,096
I guess congratulations are in order.

644
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:56,485
We have to hand it
to our federal agents here.

645
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:59,803
Though we would have preferred
to bring him in and charge him,

646
00:31:59,804 --> 00:32:01,564
this case looks pretty much wrapped up.

647
00:32:01,957 --> 00:32:04,703
There's no need to congratulate us
for doing what is our job.

648
00:32:04,704 --> 00:32:07,481
We don't ask for commendation for
what is merely our proud honor

649
00:32:07,482 --> 00:32:08,754
of servitude to our country.

650
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,986
Perhaps just a small hug.

651
00:32:12,902 --> 00:32:14,331
Just an itty-bitty one.

652
00:32:15,053 --> 00:32:16,099
I'm serious.

653
00:32:17,443 --> 00:32:18,476
Too much?

654
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:24,189
So how'd you sleep?

655
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:31,252
Well, I guess I was right
about one thing.

656
00:32:31,295 --> 00:32:33,439
It turned out to be a
pretty good week for you.

657
00:32:45,015 --> 00:32:47,109
Look, I'm sorry, Shawn.

658
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:48,965
I don't know what
you want me to say to you.

659
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,090
I don't know either.

660
00:32:50,231 --> 00:32:51,689
You lost a case. You lose.

661
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,328
She's on the winning side,
you're on the losing side.

662
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:54,944
She's the winner, you're the loser.

663
00:32:55,804 --> 00:32:59,411
You know, dad, had I made
a list of things I did want to hear,

664
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:01,638
that wouldn't even
have made the top eight.

665
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:04,156
Something is really off with this cake.

666
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:08,100
But, Shawn, you want my advice,

667
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:09,459
I think you should quit.

668
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:11,609
- What?
- You should quit.

669
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,760
That's what you do. When things get tough,

670
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:15,848
somebody's better than you, you quit.

671
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:17,729
- Where is this even coming from?
- Oh, come on, Shawn,

672
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,883
I've got 80 examples sitting
on the tip of my tongue.

673
00:33:20,054 --> 00:33:22,918
Eighth grade you quit the bassoon when
Bobby Nowocinski beat you out

674
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,397
for the solo in the winter festival.

675
00:33:24,447 --> 00:33:25,325
Let me get this straight.

676
00:33:25,326 --> 00:33:29,484
You have an example from eighth grade
sitting on the tip of your tongue?

677
00:33:29,512 --> 00:33:31,683
Shawn, the point is, a year from now,

678
00:33:31,684 --> 00:33:34,224
you won't even be working for
the Santa Barbara Police Department.

679
00:33:34,266 --> 00:33:36,543
- You don't know that.
- All right, look, Shawn,

680
00:33:36,544 --> 00:33:39,476
now I'm gonna tell you something
that you do want to hear.

681
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:45,283
I accept you for who you are.

682
00:33:46,786 --> 00:33:48,895
- Is that a fact?
- That is a fact.

683
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:51,999
You don't have to prove anything to me.
I'm gonna let you off the hook.

684
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:54,717
Now, how's that feel, better?

685
00:33:55,254 --> 00:33:57,490
Now you can go ahead,
and you can quit this too.

686
00:34:01,995 --> 00:34:04,155
First of all... and I think
I can say this now

687
00:34:04,156 --> 00:34:05,733
with a fair amount of certainty...

688
00:34:05,734 --> 00:34:07,940
there's definitely something
not right about this cake.

689
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:10,639
Maybe because it was baked
with a child's oven.

690
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:13,865
We're talking about a deluxe
Easy-Bake Oven, Gus.

691
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:16,995
I paid over $300 for it on eBay.
This is hardly a toy.

692
00:34:17,062 --> 00:34:18,959
Okay, I didn't major in psychology,

693
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,548
but I'm gonna guess this doesn't have
anything to do with the cake.

694
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:22,609
I'm sorry.

695
00:34:23,115 --> 00:34:25,917
It's got nothing to do with you or me
or my dad or the cake.

696
00:34:27,573 --> 00:34:29,511
It's got a little something
to do with the cake.

697
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:33,611
But it's mostly about Lindsay
showing us up on this case.

698
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,215
She's either a crazy-good psychic,

699
00:34:37,216 --> 00:34:39,579
or she's just a better
detective than me.

700
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,478
Hey, I thought you had her
back at the hotel

701
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:44,916
when you surprised her
with that $500.000 thing.

702
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:47,619
<i>I'm getting more...
I'm getting a lot more.</i>

703
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,683
Like 500.000, which would last
more than just a while.

704
00:34:51,684 --> 00:34:53,789
- Maybe a whole lifetime.
- That's not possible.

705
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:55,528
I did have her.

706
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:57,468
I totally had her. Come on!

707
00:35:02,965 --> 00:35:04,680
Mildred, you kept a record of everything

708
00:35:04,681 --> 00:35:06,733
that was said in this investigation.
Am I right?

709
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,082
If someone as little as burped,
I got it down.

710
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:10,752
- There's a symbol for burp?
- Terrific.

711
00:35:10,753 --> 00:35:12,140
I need you to clarify something for me.

712
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:14,756
Two days ago, in the morning,
outside the Home Depot center.

713
00:35:14,757 --> 00:35:17,622
Ewing and Leikin making small talk.
Can you read that back?

714
00:35:20,045 --> 00:35:24,669
- What was that, 0700 hours?
- No, no, it was 7:00 a. m.

715
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:26,404
Here's something.

716
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:29,007
Ewing: "Do you know
of a good chocolatier?"

717
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:30,926
Leikin: "I had someone in Seattle,

718
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:33,809
specialized in hazelnut
praline stuff... very good."

719
00:35:33,851 --> 00:35:35,959
- It was just after that.
- Something about the dye

720
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,502
used in public swimming pools

721
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:39,018
to identify urine?
- No.

722
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:40,325
- The musical Wicked?
- No.

723
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:42,260
- Something about coffee?
- Yes, that's it.

724
00:35:42,332 --> 00:35:43,640
Mildred, could you read
the coffee thing?

725
00:35:43,682 --> 00:35:45,635
Ewing: "You breached protocol, Leikin.

726
00:35:45,636 --> 00:35:49,376
I waited for you outside the hotel,
0630, but you weren't there."

727
00:35:49,418 --> 00:35:52,008
"Yeah, sorry, I got up early
and went to grab coffee."

728
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,735
Mildred, where are Ewing and Leikin now?

729
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:59,557
Where I'm supposed to be... catching
a chartered flight back to Washington.

730
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:00,836
- I'm late.
- Not a problem.

731
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:02,945
We'll give you a ride. We happen
to be headed that way.

732
00:36:02,973 --> 00:36:03,794
That's great.

733
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,092
- Mildred, here, say this.
- Shotgun.

734
00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:07,363
Tough luck, buddy.

735
00:36:10,032 --> 00:36:12,168
Well, folks...

736
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:14,858
You all did a nice job
on this investigation.

737
00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:17,813
So, uh...

738
00:36:18,237 --> 00:36:20,204
you have a MySpace page or something?

739
00:36:21,988 --> 00:36:23,148
Whoa, Lindsay, Lindsay, Lindsay!

740
00:36:23,149 --> 00:36:24,450
Wait, wait, wait!

741
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:30,740
I just wanted to make sure I had
an opportunity to congratulate you,

742
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:32,065
you know, personally.

743
00:36:32,615 --> 00:36:36,089
- Thank you. It's not necessary.
- No, no, no, it is necessary.

744
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,800
You did it. You cracked it.

745
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:40,941
I mean, you deserve all the credit...
You're amazing. She's an amazing person.

746
00:36:41,372 --> 00:36:44,187
Look, Shawn, don't feel too bad.

747
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:48,754
- There'll be other cases.
- Yeah, yeah, I know. I know.

748
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:51,867
But not for you.

749
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:53,771
You see...

750
00:36:53,772 --> 00:36:56,857
It all started when you identified
the scar on the jaw line

751
00:36:56,858 --> 00:36:59,433
of our counterfeiter, along with
his little diamond-stud earring.

752
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:02,248
I mean, I couldn't even
draw a hair color.

753
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:05,013
So there's no way that
you could do that unless...

754
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,079
Unless you'd already seen him before.

755
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:12,693
- This is ridiculous.
- Is it?

756
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,032
It's not like I'm wearing
a giant moose costume.

757
00:37:17,481 --> 00:37:19,346
I had a vision you were drinking coffee.

758
00:37:19,388 --> 00:37:22,261
- Oh, congratulations.
- But not at the hotel.

759
00:37:24,848 --> 00:37:28,818
You were driving past one Starbucks,
two Starbucks, 17 Starbucks,

760
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:30,771
and ended up all the way in Goleta.

761
00:37:31,437 --> 00:37:33,474
On the very same day that
Grabinski's Lamborghini

762
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:36,672
was spotted just outside of town in...
Anybody?

763
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:40,473
- Special?
- Goleta.

764
00:37:40,603 --> 00:37:43,041
That's right. Goleta.

765
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:48,181
The two of you were partners
and you were in touch the whole time.

766
00:37:48,368 --> 00:37:51,283
What's more, they were
lovers in the night.

767
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:52,684
I'm seeing somebody.

768
00:37:52,742 --> 00:37:55,176
I didn't think it was possible
to fall in love with somebody

769
00:37:55,177 --> 00:37:56,545
in the span of five minutes.

770
00:37:56,615 --> 00:37:59,917
She got us so close to the counterfeiter
a month ago in Wilmette, Illinois.

771
00:37:59,974 --> 00:38:01,836
Probably just missed him
by five minutes.

772
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:03,103
That's when you met him.

773
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:05,459
You didn't miss him. She had him.

774
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:07,470
She had your bad boy red-handed.

775
00:38:07,521 --> 00:38:09,134
Suddenly you were much more interested

776
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:11,794
in combining forces and
making a whole lot of money.

777
00:38:12,298 --> 00:38:13,430
And it was going well.

778
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:15,199
It was going very well...

779
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:17,453
Until you blew it.

780
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,240
You know which moment
I'm talking about, right?

781
00:38:19,241 --> 00:38:21,179
The one in the hotel room.
When you realized

782
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,888
he had printed way more than
the 50,000 that you'd planned.

783
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:24,907
And the passport?

784
00:38:25,317 --> 00:38:28,203
So you called him that morning,
you met him at the warehouse.

785
00:38:28,204 --> 00:38:30,315
It was you who struggled with him.

786
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:33,880
And it was you who shot him dead.

787
00:38:35,117 --> 00:38:37,027
Only then, having your vision

788
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:40,041
that miraculously led everyone
here to the crime scene.

789
00:38:40,905 --> 00:38:45,634
Oh, come on. I mean, I've seen poor
losers before, but this is just sad.

790
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,785
Your DNA was all over him.

791
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:51,377
But you covered your tracks by touching
the body in front of everybody

792
00:38:51,378 --> 00:38:53,696
before forensics had a chance
to come in and brush it.

793
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:54,911
Or comb it.

794
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:56,468
Braid it.

795
00:38:57,232 --> 00:38:58,845
- Maybe put it in pigtails.
- Shawn!

796
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:01,158
That only leaves one outstanding issue.

797
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:04,116
And that is...
Where's the rest of the money?

798
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:06,111
Wait a minute.

799
00:39:06,663 --> 00:39:07,668
What's happening?

800
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,376
What's happening to me?

801
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:12,053
I've heard about this.

802
00:39:13,523 --> 00:39:15,787
It's called spontaneous
psychic krav maga.

803
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,967
Oh, my, it's the bag.

804
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:23,470
Something's in the bag!

805
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:27,199
It's bad. It's very bad.
And it could be embarrassing.

806
00:39:38,122 --> 00:39:40,104
Well, you were wrong
about one thing, Shawn.

807
00:39:41,957 --> 00:39:44,137
I didn't sleep with you
because you were my enemy.

808
00:39:44,138 --> 00:39:47,582
I did it because I really thought
we had something.

809
00:39:47,848 --> 00:39:48,853
Okay.

810
00:39:49,072 --> 00:39:51,718
First of all, a little discretion
would be nice. All right?

811
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:54,194
I mean, these are...
These are my co-workers.

812
00:39:55,138 --> 00:39:57,742
Secondly, anything
we had, you ruined.

813
00:39:58,548 --> 00:40:00,572
Because you betrayed your gift, Leikin.

814
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:04,025
You give a bad name to psychics like me

815
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,431
who pride themselves
on the purity of that gift.

816
00:40:06,432 --> 00:40:09,540
There are so many people out there
who already doubt what we do.

817
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:12,314
Now you've given 'em all a reason
to think that we're fakes.

818
00:40:12,924 --> 00:40:15,499
You sicken me...
I'm sickened.

819
00:40:18,057 --> 00:40:21,770
I mean, sure, I'm still wildly attracted
to you on the physical level, but...

820
00:40:21,771 --> 00:40:25,790
spiritually and psychically,
you're dead to me.

821
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:30,585
Gun! I'm taking him
and I'm taking the plane.

822
00:40:40,465 --> 00:40:41,951
This is not what it looks like.

823
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,834
Okay, they're just processing
Ms. Leikin's arrest before

824
00:40:47,835 --> 00:40:49,580
we put her back on a plane to Washington.

825
00:40:49,707 --> 00:40:52,019
It'd be great if you guys could give me
