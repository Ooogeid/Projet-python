1
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,303
Hey.
What the hell is going on here?

2
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:23,565
Nothing.

3
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,516
My mistake.
Sorry, guys.

4
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:29,419
That's okay.
See you later, dad.

5
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,538
Okay, Shawn...
out with it.

6
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:41,899
We're starting a secret club.

7
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:43,466
The "burn down the House" club?

8
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,048
The Gus and Shawn club.

9
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:48,912
It's actually the Shawn and Gus club.

10
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:53,439
You know, a club needs regulations,
by laws. You guys got any rules?

11
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:55,909
Yes, no girls.

12
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:58,975
And everybody has to be under 12.
No old guys.

13
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:01,385
And they have to have
a love of correct grammar.

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,999
That's not a rule!

15
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:05,622
You said we could have
one special rule, that's mine.

16
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,530
And that's the best
rule you could think of?

17
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:11,230
I think you mean that's the best rule
of which you could think.

18
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:13,669
I'm not being in a club with this.

19
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:18,383
Fine, I don't need you
and your mis placed prepositions.

20
00:01:22,036 --> 00:01:23,329
Wanna be in a club?

21
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,489
Dude, I feel like the weight
of the world is off my shoulders.

22
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:33,135
One phone call, and my mountain
man trip with my dad is off.

23
00:01:33,204 --> 00:01:34,304
Why'd he back out?

24
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:36,219
He was sick.

25
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:37,587
He sounded horrible.

26
00:01:37,652 --> 00:01:39,234
He was lurching, he was coughing.

27
00:01:39,354 --> 00:01:40,724
He even sounded pale.

28
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:43,033
- How do you sound pale?
- I don't know.

29
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,923
Maybe he didn't sound pale,
but he definitely sounded feverish.

30
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,578
Maybe he's driving
himself to the hospital.

31
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,601
You know what this means.
What we gotta go.

32
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:13,142
There's no time to discuss. Oh, Gus...

33
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:14,662
- Pay.
- Shawn.

34
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:21,047
I still don't see
why you're so up tight.

35
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,255
30 seconds ago you were
thrilled your dad bailed on you.

36
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:26,199
That's when I thought he was dying.

37
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:28,905
Dude,

38
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,111
do you realize where we are right now?

39
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:33,910
That's the Monarch Lodge.

40
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:41,933
Your dad's a member?

41
00:02:42,016 --> 00:02:43,251
Are you kidding me?

42
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:44,691
We're going in.

43
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:45,790
Shawn.

44
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:50,063
You can't just walk
into the Monarch Lodge.

45
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:51,705
They're a clandestine society.

46
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,464
They have a secret Handshake.

47
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:58,788
Fold it, fold it, skim it.

48
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:00,894
Crouching Tiger, Zookeeper's boy,

49
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:04,296
hairdresser on fire,
girlfriend in a coma.

50
00:03:04,443 --> 00:03:05,717
Slap it on a biscuit.

51
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:10,106
You might not want to do that.

52
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:13,062
Dr Guster just insemin
a Ted an appaloosa.

53
00:03:13,504 --> 00:03:16,421
- All the way up to the elbow.
- No time to wash up.

54
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:17,843
Thank you.

55
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,213
You're a good man.

56
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,634
I've always wanted to
see the inside of this place.

57
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,709
Oscar Landon Clark.

58
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:28,841
He started the Santa Barbara mirror.

59
00:03:28,986 --> 00:03:29,738
Dude...

60
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:31,505
Moby's a Monarch.

61
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:32,853
That's not Moby, Shawn.

62
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:35,094
Martin A Turner.

63
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:36,703
The city's first post master.

64
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:38,338
Can you believe this?

65
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:40,554
I'm Pretty sure that's Chuck
from the wonder years.

66
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:45,432
Dude.

67
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:48,678
Oh, my
god.

68
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:52,200
- That is really disturbing.
- <i>Jeez, what are you doing?</i>

69
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:55,240
<i>Come on, Ted, dragging me
all the way over here for this!</i>

70
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:58,495
Dad, you owe me an explanation...

71
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,657
what the hell are you into?

72
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,343
Saison 2 - Episode 14

- www.forom.com 

76
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,896
You need to call the police.

77
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:55,918
We did.

78
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:57,283
A Policeman and a brother.

79
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:58,962
Ted, I'm retired...

80
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,162
from both.

81
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,611
S.B.P.D.

82
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,549
Here,
I'll dial for you.

83
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,657
Let's go.

84
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:06,035
This is unbelievable.

85
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,252
Practically every doctor
in the city is a member here.

86
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,643
- Do you realize what this means?
- Yes, it means my dad,

87
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:14,120
Mr. Integrity, is nothing more
than a lying liar from Liarsburg.

88
00:05:14,492 --> 00:05:15,764
That's Dr Downs.

89
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:18,599
He has a Huge practice on the mesa,
and he just dumped his rep.

90
00:05:18,662 --> 00:05:20,630
I've been trying to get
in there for years.

91
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:22,436
I'll be right back.

92
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:24,193
Don't step on the corpse head.

93
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:29,819
How'd you get in here?

94
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:34,064
I think I should ask you the same thing.
Sick faker! Let me feel your fore head.

95
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,938
What are you doing, following me around?

96
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,165
I don't have time for this, Shawn. Take
a look, there's a dead body in the room.

97
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:41,996
Yes, Mr Arthur Holmstrom.

98
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:43,612
He was murdered.

99
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:48,677
Three creams, four sugars.

100
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,319
- Thank you.
- And here's this.

101
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:52,226
-What's this?
-Yours didn't cost anything.

102
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:53,736
Dropped my name?

103
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:55,439
No, coffee club.

104
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:58,141
Buy 15 coffees, you get one free.
You should get one.

105
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,728
Gee, I don't know.

106
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:02,115
I mean, what am I gonna do
witch over the cash.

107
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:04,799
- let me give you a little lesson, O'hara.
<i>- We have 1144.</i>

108
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:07,084
<i>Deceased male, 1385 Granada place.</i>

109
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,274
Detectives Lassiter and O'hara en route.

110
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:12,406
You know that's littering.

111
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:16,685
- Back up, what do you mean "murdered"?
- Maybe poisoned. I'm not sure yet.

112
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:19,421
Shawn, this is not the place
for one of your reckless assumptions.

113
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:20,989
Dad, take a look around.

114
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:22,909
These guys Hardly
seem broken up by this.

115
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:25,413
I've known Arthur Holmstrom
since the day he joined this Lodge.

116
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:26,887
He was not the most likable guy.

117
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:28,429
Fine. Whatever.

118
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:30,632
I have more important
issues to deal with.

119
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:32,367
I want the truth.

120
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:34,492
What really happened to my cat,
Chairman meow?

121
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:36,219
- You want answers?
- I want the truth.

122
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,999
You can't handle the truth!

123
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,424
You drive mea little crazy, Shawn.

124
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,881
The idea of spendingan
entire weekend with you.

125
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:46,457
- I drive you crazy?
- Yeah.

126
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:47,838
And your cat?

127
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,814
Got a little too familiar
with the armrest of my sofa.

128
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:51,726
There.

129
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:54,849
Henry, I am really sorry for
pulling you in on such short notice.

130
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:57,009
It's just we were allreally
nervous about this.

131
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:00,469
I mean, what if we did something wrong?
He had that hood on for 20 minutes.

132
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:02,656
- What if he suffocated?
- Ted, calm down.

133
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:03,959
It's a cloth hood.

134
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:06,079
You've performed this ceremony,
what, a dozen times?

135
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:09,243
I know, I know. It's just that we want
to make sure it's handled right.

136
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,712
You talked to the police, right?

137
00:07:10,732 --> 00:07:13,999
Yes, yes. Thank you, thank you.
Say, is this your son?

138
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:16,292
You know how we love a
legacy around here.

139
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,666
No, no, no.

140
00:07:17,885 --> 00:07:21,590
No, yes, he is my son,
technically, but I,

141
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,454
Ted, I'm getting.

142
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,439
No, no, you don't. Not here, Shawn.
This is not the time for your she Nanigans.

143
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,349
It was a Single she Nanigan.
Technically more of a Hijink.

144
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:33,906
Pet killer!

145
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:35,719
I'm not a Pet killer, Shawn.

146
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:39,251
Chairman Meow is living very
happily in a retirement homein Ojai.

147
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:44,130
And I don't want to burst your bubble,
but Chairman Meowis Chairwoman Meow.

148
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:57,226
Spencer.

149
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:00,201
No.

150
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:02,450
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

151
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,775
What the hell are you doing here?

152
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:09,402
Lassie, as it happens,
my father is a member here.

153
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,699
That's impossible.

154
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,781
Benevolent lodge ruleab 4567 bars any law
enforcement member from being a member.

155
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:18,872
Yeah, and that ruleis Bogus.

156
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:21,439
We made that up
to keep out undesirables.

157
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,620
"Undesirables"?

158
00:08:22,797 --> 00:08:24,823
People who aren't Lodge material.

159
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,051
Or anyone who's been
married to my daughter.

160
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:28,833
And you are?

161
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,826
This is irving Parker.

162
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,993
He's my father in la.

163
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,538
Excuse me.

164
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:37,669
Soon to be former father-in-law.

165
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:39,207
Not so fast.

166
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,069
Victoria and I have had several
civil conversations lately.

167
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,584
Give it up, Carlton!

168
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:46,899
It was a lost cause two years ago,
and it's a lost cause now.

169
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,644
Get over it. She has.
Move on!

170
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,821
I think we'll all be better off for it.

171
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,870
Can I talk to you for a second?

172
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:03,209
Are you sure you want to be on this case?
You have a personal involvement here.

173
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:04,899
That's right, O'hara, this is personal.

174
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,709
And if it does turn out to be something,
that's exactly why I need to be on it.

175
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:09,609
But these people have
something against you.

176
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,830
- They won't anymore after I solve it.
- Carlton...

177
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,241
look, you don't understand, O'hara.
I need to be the hero.

178
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,773
I need to solve this case quickly,

179
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:18,609
and look brilliant in the process,
and you need to help me do that.

180
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:20,147
Please.

181
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:22,389
It's been a pleasure talking with you,
dr.Downs.

182
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:24,649
Well, you make quite an impression,
mr. Guster.

183
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:27,349
And under the circumstances,
that's saying something.

184
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:29,304
Well, thank you very much.

185
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,109
And once again, I want to
express my sincere condolences.

186
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:35,139
Perhaps you could give my office a call,
and we could set a side some time.

187
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:37,079
How about monday?

188
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:38,414
Terrific.

189
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:40,031
Great.

190
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:49,732
We're done here.

191
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:50,978
Gus.

192
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:52,655
Thanks.

193
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:55,025
And another thing, dad.

194
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:57,039
Just when,
exactly, were you a member here?

195
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:58,597
It was a long time ago, Shawn.

196
00:09:58,636 --> 00:10:00,207
I'm not a part of this place anymore.

197
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:04,149
And whe ther or not this was murder,
you are he reby ordered to steer clear.

198
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:06,049
These guys are not to be messed with.

199
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,143
I cannot possibly
be more serious about this.

200
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,329
Tuesday at 11:00 is perfect.

201
00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:20,194
I'll be there with bells on.

202
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:21,699
Okay.

203
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,182
Dude, who says that?

204
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:25,249
Closers.

205
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:26,430
Closers say that.

206
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:29,279
Well, if by closers you mean
middle-aged women, then,

207
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:31,111
yes, I do believeI've heard the phrase.

208
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:34,315
Are you for getting that we many
have stumbled up on a murder today?

209
00:10:34,562 --> 00:10:37,244
A murder that you're
taking entirely too unseriously?

210
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,112
The man's name was Arthur Holmstrom,

211
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:44,549
and he died during
the sacred star ceremony.

212
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:45,988
Get over here, look at this.

213
00:10:50,555 --> 00:10:51,771
It's weird.

214
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:53,015
Weird?

215
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:56,159
Those guys look down right evil.
White men in hoods?

216
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:58,573
- Dude, they're violet.
- That's how it starts, Shawn.

217
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,246
Do you see that?

218
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:08,832
Holy crap, Shawn.
Your dad was right.

219
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:11,234
It's one of those scary Lodge guys.

220
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:19,962
They're here for us. They know
you think they killed that guy.

221
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,816
Lassie.

222
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:33,802
What are you doing here?

223
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,441
I think you know why I'm here.

224
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:39,039
Hope fully you're here to help. Gus and
I were about to do some scrap booking.

225
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:41,524
We'll need someone who
can work the scalloped scissors.

226
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,229
Spencer, I get why you have
to act like an ass at my station,

227
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:46,126
but do you have to act
like this in your own office?

228
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:47,699
It enhances my perception.

229
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:51,089
How else would I know that you came
here because you think Arthur Holmstrom

230
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,478
was murdered?

231
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,367
No one's talking down at the lodge.

232
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,493
I was just driving by the office
and saw the lights on.

233
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:02,152
You want to hire us.

234
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:06,796
Come on, Lassie, it's not that tough.
Let it go.

235
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:08,289
- Lass, come on.
- Look around,

236
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:10,888
you're in a safe place.
Surround ed by men

237
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,632
who love you.

238
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:13,631
Gus.

239
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,734
Lassiter,
I love you.

240
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:20,428
Look...

241
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:23,014
you have a connection in there.

242
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:25,706
So I need you to feel around
and see what you canfind out.

243
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:27,804
The department's hiring us?

244
00:12:27,824 --> 00:12:30,921
Not the department, me.
And I can't pay you.

245
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:33,153
Well, that sounds worth while.

246
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:36,103
I guess this would technically
be called a...

247
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:38,246
favor.

248
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,619
Maybe I could pay your expenses.

249
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,509
Done!

250
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,059
15 grand a day.

251
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,769
When we're finished,
we all go for a picnic.

252
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:48,999
This is a discreet investigation.

253
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:50,529
I'd like to show you something.

254
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:53,495
See this?

255
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:55,564
It's the Lodge radar.

256
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,123
And look at this.

257
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:58,768
It's me...

258
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:01,098
flying under neath it.

259
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,511
Now look down here.

260
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:06,961
It's gus.

261
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:08,529
He can't fly.

262
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:11,534
It is imperative
that you keep a low profile.

263
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,749
Place the Robeon
our new brother.

264
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:36,560
That's it?
I'm official?

265
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:38,476
No brimstone?

266
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:41,649
I don't have to crab walk
or get tickled with a feather?

267
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:43,928
Come on, somebody,
tickle me with a feather, you.

268
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,469
Gentlemen,
to the bar.

269
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,481
Yes.

270
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:47,690
Save me a shot.

271
00:13:54,403 --> 00:13:56,904
Don't you think it's odd
that it's just businessas usual

272
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:58,828
when someone died here the other day?

273
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:00,059
Definitely.

274
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:03,139
It appears as though he's
been all but forgot ten. Look.

275
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,730
Holmstrom's already been moved.

276
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:06,879
Those paintings are in order of rank.

277
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,299
Once the high most Patriarch moves on,
he's replaced by the next guy in line.

278
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:12,184
- That's Irving Parker.
- Right.

279
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,357
Holmstrom was fifth in line.

280
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,278
Some how he leap frogged
three other guys,

281
00:14:18,298 --> 00:14:21,550
in Cluding Parker
and two of your Doctor Buddies.

282
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:31,105
25 "G"s for "komputers for kids"?

283
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:36,344
30 "g"s for "toys for kids.
" 15 grand for "clothing for kids"?

284
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:38,129
These guys are ultra-philanthropists.

285
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:40,459
They're the most charitable
organization in the city.

286
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,379
Why would they commit murder?

287
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:44,996
Well, maybe it was for the kids.

288
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,445
"The shroud of Charlemagne.

289
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,850
" Dude, Holmstrom was wearing
this hood the day he died.

290
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:00,364
Check it out, it's 100 years old.

291
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,295
Like a lot of the
guys around this place.

292
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,878
Sorry.

293
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,361
- What?
- Nothing.

294
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,403
Thank you.

295
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:15,357
Shawn.

296
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:17,208
You know my newest clients,

297
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:20,568
Dr. Masood Nigam,
and Dr. Roger Downs.

298
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:22,129
Yes, yes, I do.

299
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:24,172
Congratulation son your client ship.

300
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,907
Just, you're in good hands with gus.

301
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:29,060
Nimble, agile hands.

302
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,469
Surgeon's hands, really.

303
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:32,329
He once removed a boil
from his own thigh

304
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,271
using a paper clip
and a warm can of sprite.

305
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,699
Dude, when did you have
time to make all these sales?

306
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:42,209
We were in there for an hour.

307
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:45,576
An hour is all you need, Shawn,
when you've got sales reptitude.

308
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:49,402
Dr. Mccormerly,
can I talk to you for a second?

309
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:55,369
You're calling me a day after our first date?
You really are out of practice.

310
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,589
So what'd you find out?

311
00:15:56,609 --> 00:16:00,269
Well, it appears our victim
made top dog with very little effort.

312
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:04,769
One day he was fifth in line for the job,
the next day he was high most Patriarch.

313
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:06,150
And the next day he was dead.

314
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:07,772
Does anyone suspect you?

315
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:10,451
No.
Members are beyond suspicion.

316
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,029
Members?

317
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:16,749
Sweet justice!
They made you a member?

318
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:19,085
Now, don't get all mad, Lassie.

319
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:21,019
There was a 15-minute waiting period.

320
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,872
I finally learned the lyrics to informer
while they convened and agreed on me.

321
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:35,391
Let me give you my card, dr. Mccormerly,
'cause you do not want to miss out

322
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:36,934
on this baby.

323
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,643
Are you staking me out?

324
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:43,763
No.

325
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:45,365
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

326
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,583
I can sense you're right
around the corner.

327
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:54,123
Whoa, you're breaking up.
Can you call me back, Lassie?

328
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:57,324
I don't have time for this.
I've got another call.

329
00:16:57,989 --> 00:16:59,062
O'hara, finally.

330
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:00,331
Where are you?

331
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:02,359
I'm...
at lunch.

332
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,161
Get me a Turkey and Avocado.

333
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:06,613
- Let me talk to her.
- Hands off!

334
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,721
- Is someone there with you?
- Hi, Jules.

335
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:12,608
- Spencer.
- You're having lunch with Shawn?

336
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:14,518
- Maybe.
- Is something going on?

337
00:17:14,556 --> 00:17:16,910
Look, do you have the toxicology
reports on Holmstrom or not?

338
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:19,641
Yeah, but they're inconclusive. Well,

339
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:22,529
- actually, they're just strange.
- Strange how?

340
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:23,658
Oh, come on.

341
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,639
Well, it doesn't look like natural causes,
and his blood had trace elements of...

342
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,001
I don't even want to say.

343
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,431
Come on, O'hara.

344
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:37,831
Well, it had what looks like
the toxin similar to the Venom of a

345
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,918
Brazilian vine snake.

346
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,843
You've gotta be kidding me.

347
00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:44,530
- He got bit by a snake?
- Am I on speaker phone?

348
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,289
No.

349
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:48,026
- Well, then, how did he hear.
- Jules, how bout you just tell us?

350
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:51,086
He didn't have a Mark on him.
There weren't any puncture wounds.

351
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:53,757
The only thing he had was a
little skin irritation on his face.

352
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,583
Obviously these results are
inconclusive, so run the tests again

353
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:58,909
because we need results
that aren't ridiculous.

354
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:01,639
I don't know, Lassie,
I kind a like this snake idea.

355
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:05,618
Why are you sharing information with
Shawn on a case we haven't hired him for?

356
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:12,389
You know what, O'hara,
You, breaking. I call you back.

357
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:16,526
Nice.

358
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,289
You Joined the Lodge?

359
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:23,220
What can I do, dad?
I'm a legacy. It's in our blood.

360
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,698
Damn it, Shawn, I'm not kidding.
You've gott are consider this.

361
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:29,079
You get a lot of power ful people in to
one room, and dangerous things happen.

362
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:32,179
Would you please let the Police
just do their job?

363
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:34,514
- I am working for the Police.
- Sort of.

364
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:35,936
It's a discreet investigation.

365
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:38,951
- Yeah discreet, that's one of your talents.
- I'm working on a theory.

366
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:42,388
Arthur Holmstrom was
poisoned with Snake Venom.

367
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,929
- Snake Venom.
- The Brazilian vine Snake.

368
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:48,518
Specific to remote river
basins in nor thern Brazil.

369
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:50,579
About
two to three feet in length.

370
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:54,817
So someone snuck a three-foot snake
in to the Lodge and killed him

371
00:18:54,837 --> 00:18:56,338
during
the ceremony?

372
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,036
- The perfect crime.
- Right.

373
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:00,099
Except there were no Marks
left on the body.

374
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,173
So we're looking for an invisible snake.

375
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:06,289
You know, Shawn, that's it.
Right--right there.

376
00:19:06,347 --> 00:19:07,581
That is your problem.

377
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:10,635
Maybe you'd be better off looking
for something that you can see.

378
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,779
There is a pecking,
order, right in front of your eyes.

379
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:16,309
Dad, you're gonna ruin my diagram!

380
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:19,116
Yep, who's at the top?

381
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:20,832
Who's the next guy in line?

382
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:23,466
I know where the top is,
you could have just pointed. Now there's

383
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:24,959
coke all over everything.

384
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:27,262
Forget it.
Just grow up.

385
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:31,920
Me grow up.
A grown man makes a crawly snake.

386
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,062
This is Parker's place.

387
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:37,876
I can see the sign, Shawn.

388
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:40,600
Well, I bet they're very Busy inside.

389
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:43,582
Might I suggest coming back
this evening and breaking in?

390
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,011
Good idea.

391
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,597
Let me see what I'm doing
for the next three to five years,

392
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:49,416
with time off or good Behavior.

393
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,760
We're here now.
I can get us in.

394
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,359
All of a sudden you
can just "get us in"?

395
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:59,062
Shawn, I'm totally in a sales
zone this week.

396
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,024
You leave this secret hand shake to me.

397
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,229
I'm not showing an appointment,
mister...

398
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:09,185
Guster. Burton Guster.

399
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:11,909
And this is my associate William Zane.

400
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:15,642
I'm an old friend, and I'm just paying
Mr. Parkera birthday visit.

401
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:18,189
It's not his birthday.

402
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:20,325
I know, it's mine.

403
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,519
We're here on Lodge business.

404
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,340
That's a three right there.

405
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:26,949
What?

406
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:29,300
Nothing better to do on your birthday?

407
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,829
Well, it's my 29th, not one
of the important ones.

408
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:35,422
You'll understand when
you get to be my age.

409
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:39,929
- I'll only be a minute.
- I'll just let him know that you're here.

410
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:42,905
No, no need, Doris.
It's my birthday.

411
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:44,895
Surprise!

412
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:48,980
You still need a seven right there.

413
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,967
Billy?

414
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:57,799
It's your birthday?
That's your sales reptitude?

415
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,009
- It comes in all flavors, Shawn.
- Is suck a flavor?

416
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,678
Dude!

417
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,783
The world's very first crock-pot.

418
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,749
What the hell are you guys doing here?

419
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,589
Mr. Parker, it's me, Shawn Spencer.

420
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:16,061
- I'm the newest monarch, remember?
- Yeah, I remember.

421
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,511
So what the hell are you guys doing
wandering around my ware house?

422
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,659
This is my very good friend Gus. He's
looking to join the monarch Lodge too.

423
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:26,493
I thought maybe you could make that
happen. You know, haze him a little bit.

424
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:29,229
Soak his hand in warm water while
he's sleeping, that sort of thing.

425
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:31,743
- Do you have any sheep here?
- This is not a Lodge.

426
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:33,449
This is my place of business.

427
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:37,859
And the fact that you slid into member ship
on the coat tails of your turn coat dad,

428
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:40,659
that doesn't guarantee
any favors from me.

429
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,399
Now I'm through talking to you nicely.

430
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:45,549
I want you to turn around and
get the hell out of here.

431
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:47,081
Right now!

432
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,839
- I'm surprised he didn't say "good day.
- " What's that?

433
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:54,529
I said good day.

434
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,289
Dude, did you see those shipping crates?

435
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:07,729
"Cci, " "aif, " "xap. " Those are
airport codes, all brazilian.

436
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:09,934
Brazilian airport codes?
How do you know that?

437
00:22:10,054 --> 00:22:13,413
- I lived in an airport for a month, Gus.
- That was Tom Hanks in the terminal.

438
00:22:13,452 --> 00:22:15,303
Same difference.
We need to talk to Lassiter.

439
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:17,414
No, you need to talk to Lassiter.
I'll drop you off.

440
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:19,956
- Where are you going?
- I have appointments with four new clients.

441
00:22:19,986 --> 00:22:22,070
And product doesn't sell itself.

442
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,343
Man...

443
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,029
Lassie.

444
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:33,183
Anything?

445
00:22:33,303 --> 00:22:35,649
Well, I've got good news,
and I've got bad news.

446
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:38,979
The good news is we found a pretty
solid suspect on the Holmstrom murder.

447
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:41,353
Finally. Well, who is it?
Let's go get him.

448
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:44,010
- That's the bad news.
- That is ridiculous!

449
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,109
Who's in charge here, huh?

450
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:48,769
I'll tell you this,
I better be home for dinner!

451
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:51,649
Heads are gonna roll,
that's all I got to say!

452
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,701
Heads are gonna roll!

453
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,102
Oh, no.

454
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,409
Do not go down that road.

455
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:03,649
Look, I'm not happy
about this either, Lassie.

456
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:07,819
Now that I've joined the Lodge, that
makes your father-in-lawmy brother.

457
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:09,616
Which makes me your uncle...

458
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:13,049
in-law. It's gonna get especially
awkward around the holidays.

459
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:16,119
Spencer, you can't
seriously suspect Parker.

460
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:18,349
Unfortunately, it sort of checks out.

461
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:20,702
If it was Venom that killed
Holmstrom, it came from a snake

462
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:23,679
that only slithers in a region where
Parker does half his business.

463
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,203
He's in room "A.
"Who's going to question him?

464
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,359
I will.

465
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:30,799
Carlton, do you really think this
is a good idea? You're related.

466
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:34,666
- It's against department policy.
- O'Hara, quiet. I'm gonna handle it.

467
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:36,664
Don't you dare tell the chief.

468
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,316
I can't believe this is happening.

469
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,945
Lassiter's desk.

470
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,046
It's your wife.

471
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,520
I mean your ex-wife.

472
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,843
Hey!

473
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,333
Yeah, well,
it seems that irving is kind of a,

474
00:24:00,468 --> 00:24:02,282
well, he's a murder suspect.

475
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:03,929
Yes.

476
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:06,569
No, this is not because
I want the barbecue.

477
00:24:06,689 --> 00:24:08,479
I already gave you the golf clubs.

478
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,883
- So how'd he go?
- Not quietly.

479
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:13,019
You ever meet his wife?

480
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:16,320
No, and if she's anything like
her dad, I don't want to.

481
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:18,065
Okey Doke.

482
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,942
That seems fair.

483
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,599
O'Hara, please go down to the room.
I'll be down in a minute.

484
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:29,792
Spencer, I want you to listen
to me, and listen closely.

485
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,259
I know Irving Parker very well,
and he wouldn't kill anyone.

486
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:37,469
Sure, he might hobble their
spirit and crush their soul

487
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:39,819
and dance in the flaming ashes
of their broken marriage,

488
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:43,398
which he had a partin ending.
But he wouldn't kill anyone.

489
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,296
Look... he's the only suspect we have.

490
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,479
He tried to hate me to death.

491
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,149
I know it's circumstantial,
but in a pretty bad way.

492
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:55,299
I know, and I'm going to go treat him
just as I would any other suspect.

493
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:58,929
But I think Holmstrom's murderer is still
out there. Just... just workshop it.

494
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:01,453
Do what ever it is you do,
because at the end of the day,

495
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:04,674
it absolutely
cannot be him.

496
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,519
"Workshop it"?

497
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,973
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

498
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,559
I don't know if reverse engineering
the case was such a good idea.

499
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:38,699
"Did its" won 12-zip.

500
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:41,379
But Lassiter said he was sure
that Parker's not our guy.

501
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,380
Well, the board seems
to disagree vehemently.

502
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,689
Fine, then let's move away from him,
and check out the other Lodge members.

503
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:51,127
- What do we know about Holmstrom?
- Holmstrom.

504
00:25:51,247 --> 00:25:53,659
We know he's dead.
That's a good start.

505
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:56,679
I'm serious, Shawn. I was in that
lodge making contacts.

506
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,619
I know. You have sales reptitude.

507
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:02,029
Now can we please
retire that expression?

508
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:05,279
Throw it a party, put it on medicare,
it's just not working anymore.

509
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:09,829
No, Shawn, what I'm saying is those other Lodge
members were hardly over whelmed with grief.

510
00:26:09,949 --> 00:26:13,439
Even as Holmstrom lay on the floor,
I was shamelessly moving my product,

511
00:26:13,547 --> 00:26:15,360
and no one see med
to think anything of it.

512
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:19,112
- I'd say Holmstrom had some enemies.
- Well, we gotta figure out who they are.

513
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,079
And how do we do that?

514
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:24,676
There's something much more
important we have to do first.

515
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,459
Tobias, I've heard the canvasadds
ten pounds. Is that accurate?

516
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:37,654
Maybe you could paint some
Angry Tigers or a Puma

517
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:39,339
laying prostrateat my feet.

518
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:41,179
This is a portrait of your head.

519
00:26:41,215 --> 00:26:43,434
I thought we were here to find
something about Holmstrom .

520
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:45,289
We are. This is for posterity.

521
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:48,329
- Don't worry, you're next.
- He doesn't get one. He's not a member yet.

522
00:26:48,449 --> 00:26:51,868
Maybe we could paint him in the background
of mine. Put his head in the Puma's mouth.

523
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:53,876
You're going to ignore that.

524
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,169
Hey,why did they take Arthur Holmstrom's
painting down so quickly?

525
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:01,419
All of his things were taken
over to his house.

526
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,229
Do it lightly.

527
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,079
Say what you will about
credit cards and paper clips,

528
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,389
sometimes a door just needs to be owned.

529
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:42,189
- That's a screwdriver, Shawn.
- Screwdrivers too.

530
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:43,849
I think it was unlocked.

531
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:45,769
- It was not unlocked.
- I think it was.

532
00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:47,849
The door was most
definitely not unlocked.

533
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:49,721
Gus, the man was a widower,
nobody's here.

534
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:52,469
Why don't you let me use my new
contacts to get the information?

535
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:56,824
Is that how we do things, Gus, really?
Why talk to someone about Holmstrom

536
00:27:56,944 --> 00:28:00,539
when we could have his home office
tell us everything we need to know?

537
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,209
His hopes, his dreams...

538
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:05,871
- his love for the ladies.
- I think that's his wife.

539
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:09,658
People lie, stuff doesn't.

540
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,189
- Did you lock the front door?
- Yes, I locked the door.

541
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:15,621
I don't think it was locked.
I know I lock...

542
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,884
You see that?
They had to break a window.

543
00:28:19,004 --> 00:28:20,131
Burn!

544
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,785
No.

545
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,020
I just tried that. Well, I did it in
a different spot, Shawn!

546
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,770
He's coming,
he's coming, coming, coming!

547
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,099
Watch out!

548
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,280
People breaking into offices...
no one respects anything anymore.

549
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,785
My god, did you see who that was?

550
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:37,058
It's hard to see anything
with someone's knee in your eye.

551
00:29:37,078 --> 00:29:39,041
It's your own knee. Get out of here!

552
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,519
Look at this place.

553
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:50,469
Whoever was here wasn't invited either.

554
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,393
A secret safe.

555
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:55,839
- Dude, you gotta get us in there.
- I can't get us in that safe, Shawn.

556
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,209
That's a Martin 16.

557
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:01,379
You're 36 months into a subscription to modern
safecracker magazine... what's the point?

558
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:02,809
I'm an amateur, Shawn.

559
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:05,062
- Well, it's timet o go pro, fingers.
- Fingers?

560
00:30:05,182 --> 00:30:06,708
Twist it up.

561
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,238
Watch out.

562
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,936
Would you stop it!

563
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,852
Now I've gotta start all over.

564
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,584
This month would be good.

565
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,900
- It's not happening, Shawn.
- Try 36-24-36.

566
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,174
- Are you serious?
- Just click it in gentle.

567
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,069
That was a good idea. Now what?

568
00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:52,127
I really thought I nailed that.

569
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,035
Shawn, you've really gotta work
on your estimating skills.

570
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,195
36-24...

571
00:31:08,153 --> 00:31:09,806
Dude.

572
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,359
You're a safecracking machine!

573
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:14,295
- I know.
- Grab that.

574
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,830
All right, I've got $25, 000
for komputers for kids.

575
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,426
This one says 35, 000.

576
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,039
One of these books is a fraud.

577
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,659
Dude, Holmstrom was skimming
funds from the Lodge.

578
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:35,499
And look, he's writing in some
secret, ancient code.

579
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:37,969
No, this isn't code,
they're abbreviations.

580
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:41,929
"HX" means history, "QD" means
every day, "c" means and.

581
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:45,749
"Deposit history, "follow up with accounts
every day, transfer and with drawals.

582
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:49,343
- " You're telling me you can read this?
- Of course I can. This is doctor's Shorthand.

583
00:31:49,463 --> 00:31:51,199
And this is doctor's handwriting.

584
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:53,319
See these sticky notes?
Holmstrom wrote these.

585
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:55,809
He wasn't skimming,
he figured out who was.

586
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:58,459
One of the doctors is cooking the books.

587
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:00,766
- How sure are you?
- 85, 86%.

588
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,869
We've gone on much less.

589
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:06,143
Look, Irving, it's been four hours.

590
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,859
Is that all?

591
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,079
You know,
Carlton, it may be the rage talking,

592
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:18,759
but if I had it to do over again,
the day my tory came home with you,

593
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:21,779
I would have told her to go
right back out that door...

594
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,839
and come back alone.

595
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,559
- That's what I should have done.
- All right, Irving, that's enough!

596
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:29,209
Now, I loved Victoria,
and because she loved you,

597
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:31,939
I let it slide that
you're a pain in the ass.

598
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:36,515
But you're at my table now, and around here,
we call someone like you a hostile witness.

599
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:38,619
It's a good way to get
yourself locked up.

600
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:41,279
I can make your life a living hell,

601
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:45,499
so you better give me the respect I
deserve. And I suggest you cut the crap.

602
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:46,731
Clear?

603
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,819
I want a straight answer,
and I want it immediately.

604
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:56,819
How did Arthur Holmstrom advance
to the highmost Patriarch

605
00:32:56,939 --> 00:32:59,290
when you were the next in line?

606
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,767
Well, I don't know how
artconvinced the other guys.

607
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,589
He asked me, and I said it was okay.

608
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:10,182
He was a friend of mine, and he had
health problems. He was getting worse.

609
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:13,469
And I gave him the only chance
he'd probably ever get.

610
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:17,309
Now, as for the snake business, I haven't
traveled abroad in over three years.

611
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,909
I haven't been out of the country
since you got married.

612
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:22,153
Doctor's orders. Are we done?

613
00:33:22,273 --> 00:33:24,560
We're done when I say we're done!

614
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,684
We're done.

615
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,475
You can go.

616
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,124
We've been to four doctors' offices.
None of the hand writing matches the books.

617
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:36,762
Plus, I probably caught something
from somebody, and I'm tired

618
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:40,479
of reading high lights for children.
They always hide the apple in the bike.

619
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,816
Can you man up, Shawn?
Is that possible?

620
00:33:42,936 --> 00:33:46,419
I'm on an unbelievable hot streak
right now, and I'm not about to ruin it.

621
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:50,619
It's good to know that moving oozing infection
gel is more important than finding a killer.

622
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:53,119
Hey, maybe we could park on
a steeper incline next time.

623
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,170
My quads aren't burning enough.

624
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,835
Tell heather to call back tomorrow.

625
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,071
Yes?

626
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,309
Good afternoon.

627
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:17,549
I'm Burton Guster, with
central coast pharmaceuticals.

628
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:19,121
We're closed.

629
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,589
Yes, well, I'm here to drop
off some product to Dr. Downs.

630
00:34:23,709 --> 00:34:25,553
He's a brother of mine.

631
00:34:49,096 --> 00:34:52,699
- He isn't here at...
- Well, he was expecting me.

632
00:34:52,819 --> 00:34:54,455
You can leave your card.

633
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,559
I just thought I'd drop by
and pay him a birthday visit.

634
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:11,439
It's my birthday, the big two-nine.

635
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,165
Remember that one?

636
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,572
I'm 26.

637
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,634
Really?

638
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,822
So...

639
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,516
will Dr. Downs be here later?

640
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,574
I will make sure he gets this.

641
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,820
And look, he's writing
in some secret, ancient code.

642
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,779
Dude! I just solved it.

643
00:35:57,899 --> 00:35:59,140
Call Lassie.

644
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,996
O'Hara.

645
00:36:01,204 --> 00:36:02,259
Right.

646
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:04,561
13850 granada.

647
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,059
To absent friends.

648
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:20,049
To absent friends.

649
00:36:20,169 --> 00:36:21,983
Absent friends?

650
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,293
Like Arthur Holmstrom?

651
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,459
What?

652
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:32,199
My sweet violet brothers, we
congregate here today in the flesh,

653
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:36,877
not only to recognize our new
highmost Patriarch, Irv Parker,

654
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:39,374
but also to bear witness.

655
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,082
Along with the magic head of Gus,
the wisdom of baum...

656
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,526
and that...

657
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,339
that stuffed creature.

658
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:56,393
Arthur Holmstrom... was murdered.

659
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,125
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck,

660
00:37:02,164 --> 00:37:05,046
duck, duck, duck, duck, duck...

661
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,509
goose!

662
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,476
Dr. Roger Downs,

663
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:09,982
entrusted

664
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:14,577
with the proceeds of charity activities,
was funneling funds into his own pocket

665
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:18,259
and covering his tracks
by using a dummy accounting ledger.

666
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:20,589
Now, when Holmstrom
discovered the corruption,

667
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:24,319
he confronted downs and made a play
for the highmost Patriarch position.

668
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:27,529
In exchange for his silence,
Holmstrom got what he wanted.

669
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:32,262
But downs still couldn't chance getting
caught. And so he killed

670
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:34,849
his own Lodge brother right here

671
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:38,590
on the eye of Hathor
in the middle of the Lodge.

672
00:37:38,707 --> 00:37:39,749
And this

673
00:37:40,703 --> 00:37:42,296
is the murder weapon.

674
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:44,179
How dare you accuse me?

675
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:47,160
I am a respected officer of this Lodge.

676
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,219
By the shores of gitchagoomee,
I can see you in the house,

677
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,549
frantically searching for the ledgers that
Holmstrom kept securely stored in his safe,

678
00:37:56,669 --> 00:37:59,908
Ironically,
to keep you good to your word.

679
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,328
Arthur Holmstrom's death was,

680
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:07,665
unfortunate,
but I had nothing to do with it.

681
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,439
Check it out, Lassie.

682
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:13,867
I'm quite certain you'll find traces
of a powdered form of

683
00:38:14,148 --> 00:38:16,167
the venom of the Brazilian vine snake,

684
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:17,932
native to Brazil.

685
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,569
It's part of an antivenom that Dr. Downs
uses in his charitable work abroad.

686
00:38:22,689 --> 00:38:24,723
Who knew that in small doses

687
00:38:25,116 --> 00:38:28,724
it acts as a vaccine, while
larger doses are absolutely lethal?

688
00:38:29,129 --> 00:38:31,299
I did...

689
00:38:31,419 --> 00:38:33,609
- Really?
- This is absurd!

690
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:35,709
Holmstrom died of natural causes.

691
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:38,077
By the halls of Montezuma,

692
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,959
I see you taking great care
to put on protective gloves

693
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,732
while lining the inside of the hood
with the powder

694
00:38:44,752 --> 00:38:47,559
for Holmstrom's Patriarch ceremony,

695
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,969
making it deadly venomous.

696
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:53,329
The poor old man's
head and face never stood a chance.

697
00:38:53,449 --> 00:38:56,650
Not too keen on the hippocratic
oath, are we, Rog?

698
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,584
I have nothing to say.

699
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,989
Speak to my lawyer.

700
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:07,059
Hold it right there, Dr. Downs.
You're under arrest.

701
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,104
And none of this, your highmost,

702
00:39:09,124 --> 00:39:11,897
would have been discovered
with out the intrepid Police work

703
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,078
of one detective Carlton Lassiter,

704
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,490
Santa Barbara Police department's own

705
00:39:16,748 --> 00:39:18,310
highmost Patriarch.

706
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,959
Nice collar, detective.

707
00:39:28,985 --> 00:39:31,059
It's all in a day's work, Irving.

708
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:33,123
You may t be my son-in-lawmuch longer,

709
00:39:34,029 --> 00:39:37,470
but I'm thinking
you might be a monarch yet.

710
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,764
Hey! You ready to go?

711
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,169
- What could you possibly mean by that?
- Our big weekend, remember?

712
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:57,649
I cancelled, I felt bad.
So I just thought we'd go this weekend.

713
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,079
Dad,

714
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,525
I wish you'd given me a little bit of
advance notice. I'm... I'm swamped here.

715
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,188
Yeah, right.

716
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:12,145
All right, look, I'm gonna go. You want
to come along, you're welcome.

717
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,639
Whoa, dad, wait a second.

718
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:17,224
There's still something that
doesn't make any sense to me.

719
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,051
- Why did you leave the Lodge?
- Look, Shawn, it's not important, let it go.

720
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:25,439
Come on, you big liar. Throw a little
truth on the Barbie, see if it stinks.

721
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:28,475
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about man Candor.

722
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,989
Let's have some.

723
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:33,265
All right, all right, you want some
man Candor. You want the truth?

724
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,239
My marriage was falling apart, and I made
a choice. A stopped caring about the Lodge,

725
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,279
because I realized the only real
member ship that mattered...

726
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:41,879
was family.

727
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:43,197
There.

728
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,938
Family?

729
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,368
You really expect me to believe that?

730
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,381
What the hell is that?

731
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,747
This you gotta see.

732
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,933
Nice addition, don't you think?

733
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,781
- We grabbed 'em on our way out of the Lodge.
- Way out?

734
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:10,401
Yeah, Gus and I decided
we didn't want to belong

735
00:41:10,445 --> 00:41:13,100
to a club that would have Lassiter
as a member.

736
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,555
You can have yours if you want it.

737
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,659
Nah.

738
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:25,256
No, I think it should
stay right where it is.

739
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,985
That way I can always
keep an eye on you.
