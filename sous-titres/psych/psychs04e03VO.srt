1
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:12,637
Why is there a giant hole
in my front yard?

2
00:00:13,676 --> 00:00:15,026
It's simple, dad.

3
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:17,039
Don't get upset.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,684
The hole was my grave.

5
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:19,851
What?

6
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,971
Gus made me dig my own grave,

7
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:24,275
then shot me and stole my boots.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,318
Only he didn't bury me far enough,
and the buzzards ate my entrails.

9
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,162
So you...

10
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:33,199
You were playing cowboys
and indians, huh?

11
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,742
Just cowboys.
Playing indians is offensive.

12
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:39,205
And then the buzzards ate your entrails.
That's awful.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,961
It was a tragic end
to our adventure.

14
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:45,711
But it's the realism that makes it fun.
If it helps, Gus ended up getting hung

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,922
by a one-eyed, crooked sheriff.

16
00:00:50,273 --> 00:00:53,678
- Did the buzzards eat his entrails too?
- Of course they did.

17
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,805
I got a game for ya.

18
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,848
It's called
"get your butt in my yard

19
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,688
"and fill in that hole now."

20
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:02,146
It's the realism
that makes that fun too.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,655
He's going to kill us.

22
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:14,031
What?

23
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,409
He hasn't said a word
the whole time he's been driving.

24
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,692
Face it, Shawn.
He's finally snapped.

25
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:20,413
He asked us for a favor.
That's all.

26
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:22,581
We can leave anytime we want.
Case in point.

27
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,217
This is all your fault. You and all
your practical jokes you play on him.

28
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,845
Those were team-building exercises
to build camaraderie.

29
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:39,546
How do you build camaraderie by changing
someone's bank account numbers?

30
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:43,696
What the hell's going on back there?

31
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:46,063
Look, I know I've been
a tad annoying in the past.

32
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:49,692
But shooting Gus and disposing his body
in the aquifer is not the answer.

33
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:52,737
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not gonna shoot anyone.

34
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,114
He didn't say anything
about knifing anybody.

35
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,118
- Do you really need that clarification?
- It would be nice, yes.

36
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:04,028
So what's with all the secrecy,
you handsome, pasty devil?

37
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:09,001
What we're doing isn't exactly
official Santa Barbara police business,

38
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:11,392
and it isn't exactly
in my jurisdiction.

39
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:14,300
We're going to a small town.
The sheriff's an old friend of mine.

40
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,552
Some unexplained things
have been happening at night.

41
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,847
You two have a propensity
for finding something from nothing,

42
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:23,488
and I need that gift.

43
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:40,657
Where's the town?

44
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:43,061
This is the back.

45
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,288
The back?

46
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:52,463
Just how old is Old Sonora?

47
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:54,256
I will ask you to stifle your urge

48
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,258
to make fun of everything
that is decent.

49
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,102
Sheriff Hank is a good man
who deserves not only your respect,

50
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:00,471
but your admiration.

51
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:09,031
Sheriff!

52
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,181
Well, look at you.

53
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:15,298
Ain't you a sight for sore eyes?

54
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:18,239
- Thanks for coming.
- How you doing, sheriff?

55
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:21,575
These are the men
I was telling you about.

56
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,535
This is Burton Guster
and Shawn Spencer.

57
00:03:23,784 --> 00:03:27,720
Well, pardon me, but we had
a mess of trouble here last night.

58
00:03:28,536 --> 00:03:31,001
Sheriff Hank Mendel.
Pleasure to meet you.

59
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,586
Welcome to Old Sonora.

60
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:33,972
Thank you, sheriff.

61
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:37,224
I'm sure you've heard
about what I do, how cool it is.

62
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,510
You've now seen my hair,
which means you're impressed,

63
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,608
but let's not get wrapped up
in gushy compliments.

64
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:44,100
I get a little self-conscious.

65
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,257
Hell, I wasn't gonna
even call you out here,

66
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:47,768
but binky insisted.

67
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,146
- Binky?
- Oh, you don't call him binky?

68
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:52,940
We do now.

69
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,860
Sheriff Hank, why don't you tell
the boys what the problem's been here?

70
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:58,779
Well, it started out
as simple vandalism.

71
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:03,617
Somebody's been stealing
our wood from sidewalks, buildings,

72
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:05,064
fence posts.

73
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,456
Wood thieves.
My first instinct is beavers,

74
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,418
but I'm not willing to rule out
those pesky keeper elves.

75
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,677
- What else do you got?
- Well, our water's been poisoned,

76
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,706
and check this out.

77
00:04:19,202 --> 00:04:22,261
There's been a stench in the air
that wasn't there before.

78
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,597
That's funny.
I don't smell anything.

79
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,065
Gosh. Cat urine.

80
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:29,476
Don't mind him.
Cat pee is Gus's kryptonite.

81
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:32,067
As a child,
he was locked in a closet

82
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:34,630
with the family's incontinent tabby,
Mr. B.

83
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:37,484
- It's a very long story.
- No, it's not. That's the story.

84
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,930
Breathe through your mouth.

85
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:41,363
Since then,
things have gotten more aggressive.

86
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,770
Stuff has been stolen,

87
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:45,282
misplaced,

88
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:46,837
destroyed.

89
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:49,178
And folks are starting
to get nervous.

90
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:51,373
And it's my job to protect them.

91
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,338
Drop your weapon and come peaceably.

92
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:59,831
Well, sheriff, I ain't exactly...

93
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:01,206
a peaceful man.

94
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:13,979
- Holy crap.
- He shot that guy.

95
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:16,023
I know. Isn't it great?

96
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:29,259
This is not a real town.

97
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:31,789
It's a tourist trap.

98
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,833
Psych 403
"High Noon-ish"

99
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,677
Timing: Psych Team

100
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:28,251
Listen closely
'cause I'm gonna only say this once.

101
00:06:28,376 --> 00:06:32,016
Old Sonora is an old historic mining
town with buildings recreated

102
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,003
to capture the spirit
of the old west.

103
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,700
I spent every weekend of my childhood
in this beloved place,

104
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:38,951
and I am not about
to let some faceless coward

105
00:06:39,076 --> 00:06:41,503
who only comes out
at night tear it down.

106
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:44,528
I need you two to find out
who's doing this... and fast.

107
00:06:48,505 --> 00:06:50,617
All right.
Count on us.

108
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,035
I knew I could.

109
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,414
Here's your bedrolls.
Good luck.

110
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,824
- We're sleeping here?
- Well, it happens at night,

111
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:01,170
- so you have to stay here at night.
- What about you?

112
00:07:01,632 --> 00:07:03,760
Are you kidding?
I can't be caught investigating here.

113
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:06,257
Do you know how far out
of my jurisdiction we are?

114
00:07:08,163 --> 00:07:10,429
- See you later, Hank.
- Thanks for your help, binky.

115
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,947
You got it.
I'll check back with you in the morning.

116
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:15,722
Wait, so you expect me to stay here
the entire night?

117
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:17,728
Binky!
Come back.

118
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,164
I hope you boys like beans.

119
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:32,785
If this turns into <i>Blazing Saddles</i>,
I'm out of here.

120
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,386
- Pull that.
- Stop.

121
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:37,941
Tell me, Hank...

122
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:40,303
Have you ever seen this vandal?

123
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:44,504
I've felt 'em.

124
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:47,424
Was that in an appropriate way?

125
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,967
I felt their presence.

126
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,519
I see.

127
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:53,764
Can you think
of any other explanation

128
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,767
for why this town is falling apart?

129
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:58,811
Are you talking
about the ghost rider?

130
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:04,543
What do you mean by ghost rider?

131
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,945
According to the legends,
he was a horse thief that met his fate

132
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,338
at the end of a rope.

133
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:12,586
They say his spirit
still haunts these parts.

134
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:15,314
Now I, myself,
don't cater to this tale,

135
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,993
no matter
how many people out here see him.

136
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:22,334
- I'm out of here. I'm calling a cab.
- Those things don't work out here.

137
00:08:22,738 --> 00:08:25,096
We got no TVs, no radio,

138
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:26,505
no refrigerators.

139
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,758
Sounds like prison,
except they have all those things.

140
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,116
Would you stop it?

141
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:33,496
How long have you known binky, Hank?

142
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,180
30 years or so.

143
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:37,224
Used to come here every weekend.

144
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,017
His pa wasn't around that much,

145
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,078
and his ma worked days,
so she dropped him off Saturdays.

146
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,232
I guess he needed somebody.
I suppose I did too.

147
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,015
We've been close ever since.

148
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,027
In fact,
he's about the nearest thing

149
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,282
I got to... family.

150
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,576
I didn't know that
about Lassie's papa.

151
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,704
His pa wasn't around much, Gus.

152
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:00,289
What are you doing?

153
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,898
You hear that?

154
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,285
Something's spooking the horses.

155
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,645
What the hell are we doing?

156
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,170
I don't know, Gus.

157
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:17,211
I think I'm starting to get
why Lassie loves this place so much.

158
00:09:17,336 --> 00:09:18,975
It represents a simpler time

159
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,148
when people weren't so preoccupied
with the distractions of modern life.

160
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:23,713
Like living past age 40.

161
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:25,773
All right, you be your cynical self.

162
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,567
I'm just saying.
Technology is way overrated.

163
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:31,746
That's interesting.
Yesterday you told me you intend

164
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,392
- on having your wedding in space.
- And that hasn't changed.

165
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:37,491
I'm just saying I think the past
is also worth preserving.

166
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:40,200
Your people have
a much affectionate memory

167
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:42,122
of this period of history
than my people do.

168
00:09:42,597 --> 00:09:46,162
What are you talking about?
We saw <i>Posse</i> together in theaters.

169
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:54,181
I want to go home.

170
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,743
Yeah, that's fair.

171
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:03,127
Here's how it's gonna go.

172
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:05,364
We're gonna tell Hank
his town's old and decrepit,

173
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:07,889
and he should be glad
it didn't fall down ten years ago.

174
00:10:08,014 --> 00:10:11,015
There is no saboteur, no vandal,
no bad guy.

175
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,424
At the worst,
he has a terrible cat problem.

176
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:17,452
- Watch your feet!
- Watch my feet?

177
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:19,921
- I'm leading the way.
- Your stride is too long, Shawn.

178
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:22,207
It's your ridiculous gait.
That's the problem.

179
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:24,282
No, your shoes are too large.

180
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,876
What?

181
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:29,432
Don't panic.

182
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,003
- There's no Hank.
- No horses.

183
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:54,546
What is that sound?

184
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,830
Look out!

185
00:11:25,304 --> 00:11:27,257
- Bring him in.
- I don't believe this.

186
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:29,686
I sent you two out there to find out
what the heck's going on,

187
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:31,603
and you get sheriff Hank
run over by horses?

188
00:11:31,728 --> 00:11:34,194
First of all, I don't even know
how to get someone run over.

189
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,057
And as long as we're assigning blame,
the horses shouldn't get off scot-free.

190
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:40,259
We feel terrible about this, even it was
Hank who left us there all alone.

191
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:42,230
You're lucky he didn't get killed.

192
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,786
I don't want him bleeding
all over my couch.

193
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,122
There you go.

194
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,331
Easy.

195
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,209
- That's better.
- He should be in an emergency room.

196
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:53,949
- No hospitals.
- He doesn't believe in 'em.

197
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:56,297
Says the only way
he's ever gonna go in one is feet-first.

198
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,091
Come here.
Let's put it up here.

199
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,639
Let's take a look.

200
00:12:00,662 --> 00:12:02,721
Guys, this is deep.
This man has got to see a doctor.

201
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:04,763
I don't even have
anything to numb the pain.

202
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:07,493
That's okay.
I don't believe in anesthetics.

203
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:09,576
Gus, just bite down on my big toe.

204
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,937
It'll make me forget
about the pain in my leg.

205
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,357
I'm not.

206
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,267
Damn it, Gus, when a man asks you
to bite his toe, you bite his toe.

207
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,078
- You do it.
- Drink this.

208
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,489
Much obliged.

209
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:23,963
Hank, I just want to say
on behalf of Gus and I,

210
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:26,119
thank you very much
for saving our lives.

211
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:28,747
I'm the sheriff.
That's what I'm paid for.

212
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,290
Technically, you're not a real sheriff,
and when you say "they",

213
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:34,252
you mean you, being that you own
the town, which isn't really a town.

214
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,081
- Why?
- Just hurry up and do this, will ya?

215
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,965
I got to open them gates by 9:00.

216
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:44,147
Pal, you're not going anywhere for quite
a while even if I do get this sewn up.

217
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:47,038
Old Sonora hasn't closed in 45 years

218
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:48,558
and it ain't gonna close today.

219
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:50,721
Spencer, come here.

220
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:55,148
With everything
that's been going on out there

221
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,901
now finding this dead body,
the county wants to shut down Old Sonora

222
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,529
which means not only will a place
that teaches children lessons

223
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,643
from a simpler time be lost forever,
but sheriff Hank will be left destitute,

224
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:05,720
and I will not let that happen.

225
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:08,113
Don't worry, binky.

226
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:09,454
I already have a plan.

227
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:31,170
All right, everybody,
take a good look.

228
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:33,270
Keep looking.

229
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,539
Drink it in.

230
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:37,537
Like a...

231
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:39,861
bottle of laudanum.

232
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,864
- There a point to this?
- There's a point. This.

233
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:46,399
There's a new sheriff in town, guys.

234
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,100
It's me.

235
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:50,282
It's just for a couple days.

236
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,866
We all know
how we feel about old Hank.

237
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,537
The man loves beans.

238
00:13:54,662 --> 00:13:56,913
So I'll be helping out
after the accident last night.

239
00:13:57,038 --> 00:13:58,128
And don't worry.

240
00:13:58,324 --> 00:14:01,548
I'm not gonna go changing too much
about the way things work around here.

241
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:02,994
At least...

242
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:05,790
- not right away.
- Maybe after lunch.

243
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:08,805
I would like the opportunity
to sit down with each of you,

244
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:10,849
ask a few probing questions, and...

245
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:15,405
Get to know you a little better.

246
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,292
We can do that later.

247
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:23,859
They're not very helpful, are they?

248
00:14:23,984 --> 00:14:26,608
- How about I wear the spurs?
- How about the sheriff wears the spurs?

249
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,063
How about you kiss
my blacksmith ass?

250
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:42,013
That was county. They got an I.D.
on the body outside of Old Sonora.

251
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:44,633
- He's a Santa Barbara resident.
- Yes, that is awesome!

252
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:49,109
That's gonna at least get us
some sort of access to this case.

253
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:52,390
- I'm calling the county sheriff.
- It gets a little more strange.

254
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,185
What, he's a hobo, a drifter,

255
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,188
a psycho with a longstanding grudge
against beloved childhood institutions?

256
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:01,066
He's a multimillionaire businessman.
Frank McBain.

257
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,416
Got a house up on the hill.
Been missing for a few days.

258
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,246
Wife thought
he was on a business trip.

259
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,371
All right,

260
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:09,950
so let's figure out
what he was doing wandering alone

261
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:12,077
in the hills of Old Sonora
in sneakers and shorts.

262
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,719
In the meantime, I'm gonna call
a buddy of mine who's a county judge,

263
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:16,707
get a warrant for McBain's office.

264
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,210
The McBain homicide is a county case.
The chief made it very clear

265
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:26,258
- you are not to get involved.
- Damn it, whose side are you on?

266
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,427
I am just following jurisdictional
protocol like you taught me to do.

267
00:15:30,874 --> 00:15:32,889
Sometimes there are exceptions.

268
00:15:43,992 --> 00:15:45,066
Look at this.

269
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:48,951
All of the acreage around Old Sonora
has been purchased by McBain,

270
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:51,825
which means the only land
that he doesn't own is Hank's.

271
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,381
And Hank will never sell.

272
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:55,245
- What's this?
- That's the new toll road.

273
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:57,818
This road's supposed
to run ten miles south of here.

274
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,318
Not necessarily. The council hasn't made
its final vote yet.

275
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:02,639
So what did McBain know
that we don't?

276
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:05,505
McBain wanted Old Sonora.

277
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,034
And he would do anything to get it,
including wrecking the town,

278
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,490
tryingto shut it down,
now getting Hank run over by horses.

279
00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:11,765
We solved it!

280
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,290
Detective Lassiter and O'Hara,

281
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:18,240
you remember sheriff Becker
from the county sheriff's office.

282
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:21,059
Sheriff Becker just informed me
that you have been sticking your noses

283
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:22,542
into his investigation,

284
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:25,317
which I recall specifically
telling you not to do.

285
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:29,154
We have cause, chief.
We believe McBain was using vandalism

286
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,489
to run a cherished local
institution out of business.

287
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:33,729
The name
of this cherished local institution

288
00:16:33,854 --> 00:16:35,493
wouldn't happen to be Old Sonora?

289
00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:37,515
That's neither here nor there.

290
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,940
The fact is we have blown
this case wide open.

291
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,793
Well, I hope you have some solid
evidence to support those accusations.

292
00:16:44,544 --> 00:16:45,420
Of course.

293
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,256
It's obvious
why McBain wanted the land.

294
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:52,429
He's building a mass transit system
in association with the new toll road.

295
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:55,472
Probably at taxpayers' expense,
the heartless bastard.

296
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,885
That's a kiddie railroad.

297
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:05,065
It's a free park
that McBain is donating to the county.

298
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:07,090
Here's the permit.

299
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:12,309
He's calling it the ashley baird park.
He's not even naming it after his wife.

300
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:15,273
This woman is probably his mistress,
which makes him a two-timer.

301
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:16,808
Ashley Baird.

302
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:19,648
Wasn't she the little girl
who had leukemia?

303
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:20,872
She was so brave.

304
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,085
Okay, chief, maybe I jumped the gun
a little bit here,

305
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,004
but this McBain is one bad hombre,
you got to believe me.

306
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,776
And we can consider
this vandalism case completely closed.

307
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:33,160
- There's a few loose ends to tie up.
- Vandalis...

308
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,594
We're talking about murder!

309
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:36,805
And now we got a prime suspect.

310
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,805
You don't.
What are you talking about?

311
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,477
The person who owns Old Sonora
who wouldn't sell.

312
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:47,351
That's not possible.

313
00:17:50,658 --> 00:17:53,362
Dang it, Hank, why didn't you
tell me about Frank McBain?

314
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:56,950
You watch your language, binky,
and who the hell is Frank McBain?

315
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,953
He's been trying to buy your land
for the last two years.

316
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,609
Hank, you cannot keep
this kind of information from us.

317
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:05,125
We are killing ourselves trying
to find who may want to hurt you,

318
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,168
and you leave
a prime suspect off the table?

319
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:11,297
No, the only folks trying to buy my land
is the Sweetwater Land corp.

320
00:18:13,488 --> 00:18:15,802
I'll bet McBain used dummy corporations
to make the purchases.

321
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:19,805
It keeps prices from skyrocketing
when investors see what's going on.

322
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,893
It's a good thing she's pretty.

323
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,042
Now Sweetwater Land
don't want to hurt me.

324
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,524
They sent me two letters
six months ago.

325
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,694
I politely declined,
and I never heard from 'em again.

326
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:35,194
Are you sure?
'cause McBain's secretary said

327
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:38,032
he'd already been out to Old Sonora
three times this month alone.

328
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,118
I never spoke to the man.

329
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,494
Then who did?

330
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:53,798
What the hell is going on here?

331
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,427
This is called 19-card stud.

332
00:18:57,611 --> 00:19:00,764
Regular poker's too complicated.
It makes it easier to get pairs.

333
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:03,391
Plus,
anything with a picture's wild.

334
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:06,540
Why aren't you two out
interviewing suspects

335
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:09,647
or feeling the walls or whatever
it is you do? At least do something.

336
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:11,107
Man, I tried.

337
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:13,817
I did.
These people are kind of mean.

338
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:16,946
It's a tough racket being sheriff.
Besides,

339
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:20,867
I got to go gun down that stinky feet
fellow in about 20 minutes.

340
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:22,986
- Stinky Pete.
- You wouldn't understand.

341
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:24,871
- You've never killed a man.
- Yes, I have.

342
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,077
But you've never pretend-killed one.
Repeatedly.

343
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,336
- Struggle with it every time.
- Two times now.

344
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,938
- Both times.
- While you were sitting here

345
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:36,424
playing cowboys and indians...

346
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,468
Just cowboys.

347
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,844
Injuns is offensive.

348
00:19:40,126 --> 00:19:42,180
- I didn't say injuns, Guster.
- That's what I heard.

349
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,057
- Me too.
- Would you just shut up?

350
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,309
Hank has managed
to become our number one suspect.

351
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,932
McBain wanted his land,
and he was talking to somebody here.

352
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:51,189
You two need to find out who it was.

353
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:54,889
- You were thinking today?
- A man's life is on the line.

354
00:19:55,014 --> 00:19:56,951
Get out there, and get me a lead.

355
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:02,200
Man's all hopped up on cactus juice.

356
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,950
Let's start at the saloon.

357
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:11,288
Little lady.

358
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:18,103
- What are you doing?
- Exactly what it looks like.

359
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,006
Hee-yaw now.

360
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,195
Really?

361
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,982
It's stinky feet!

362
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,163
- He's trying to bushwhack us!
- Bushwhack us?

363
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,024
That's not stinky Pete.
He's a tourist.

364
00:21:02,768 --> 00:21:04,487
I think you're right about that.

365
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,989
Sorry about that, friend.

366
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,059
Man in my line of work
can't afford to be too careful.

367
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,991
I'm sure you understand.

368
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:18,151
Hello, Miss Annie.

369
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:23,703
I'd appreciate it if you'd refer to me
as sheriff Spencer...

370
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:25,893
Or hickory pot.

371
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,995
Or dry gulch slim.
Any of those would do me just fine.

372
00:21:29,394 --> 00:21:31,833
- That's not gonna happen.
- Fair enough.

373
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,519
- How long have you been doing this?
- About a decade.

374
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:37,295
Five years here.
Before that at Disneyland.

375
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,174
- They have madams at Disneyland?
- No, I worked the teacups.

376
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:42,898
I'll bet you did.

377
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:46,543
I'm gonna have
to ask you a couple of...

378
00:21:46,668 --> 00:21:48,711
uncomfortable-type questions
about Hank.

379
00:21:48,836 --> 00:21:51,765
- You mean that we were lovers?
- You... no.

380
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:53,727
Not... not that uncomfortable, no.

381
00:21:54,276 --> 00:21:55,605
He broke my heart.

382
00:21:57,753 --> 00:21:59,414
But that was a long time ago.

383
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,139
Ancient history.

384
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,028
Hey, there.

385
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:13,747
You the one that plays
deputy sheriff Tripsy, is that right?

386
00:22:14,393 --> 00:22:16,390
That's what it says on my paycheck

387
00:22:17,142 --> 00:22:18,211
if I still get one.

388
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:21,089
Sounds like you're not too happy
with your job right now.

389
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:24,406
Maybe you're angry enough to take it out
on your boss Hank.

390
00:22:24,531 --> 00:22:26,052
Maybe you poisoned the water

391
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,219
so that you could have Old Sonora
all to yourself.

392
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:31,516
Maybe even enough to kill for it?

393
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:35,159
I don't know
what you're talking about.

394
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:36,880
And as far as Hank goes,

395
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:38,731
I love the man like a brother.

396
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:41,850
Please.
That's what everyone says.

397
00:22:41,975 --> 00:22:43,879
- Who's everyone?
- Miss Annie.

398
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:46,364
She doesn't love him like a brother.

399
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,288
Definitely not like a brother.

400
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:50,228
Unless they have
a really weird family.

401
00:22:50,353 --> 00:22:52,326
They got some serious flowers up
in that attic.

402
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:55,201
- You know what I mean.
- How would I know that?

403
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,230
Dude,

404
00:23:01,622 --> 00:23:03,798
he was there
before the horses trampled Hank.

405
00:23:05,715 --> 00:23:07,841
Not so fast there, Tripsy.

406
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,541
You see, we know that you were
at the corral the other night.

407
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:14,766
And just for the record,
your nickname is extremely offensive.

408
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,820
So I was up there.

409
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:19,556
Something spooked the horses,
and I went up to check on 'em.

410
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:22,191
And I caught a glimpse
of whoever it was too.

411
00:23:22,524 --> 00:23:24,193
And then he vanished.

412
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,524
You're trying to tell us
it was the ghost rider

413
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:32,493
who tried to kill Hank?
Please.

414
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,912
- I don't like your tone, mister.
- Is that right?

415
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,324
'cause I've been told
it's quite soothing.

416
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,417
- Try to stay on point.
- I think you're lying, Tripsy.

417
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,170
It was you who spooked the horses

418
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,131
because you knew dag gum well
that Hank would come running.

419
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,449
That's a lie!

420
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:48,342
I love Hank Mendel.

421
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:52,764
Get the county sheriff office
on the phone.

422
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,328
You tell 'em
we found ourselves the vandal

423
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,937
and that he might have
just killed McBain too.

424
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,063
Okay, boys.

425
00:24:01,145 --> 00:24:02,604
I didn't see nobody.

426
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,359
But something spooked the horses,
and it wasn't me, I swear.

427
00:24:05,956 --> 00:24:07,070
Yeah, I was up there.

428
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:09,370
It was for a different reason.

429
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,491
I was working for McBain.

430
00:24:13,347 --> 00:24:14,160
Go on.

431
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:18,802
He was paying me to make a list

432
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:21,292
of all the safety violations
we got around this place.

433
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,503
And he was gonna use 'em
to force the county to shut us down.

434
00:24:24,772 --> 00:24:25,822
After that,

435
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,300
Hank would have no choice
but to sell to McBain.

436
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,802
And you say
he was like a brother to you.

437
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:34,847
I ain't proud of what I done,
mister.

438
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,734
Are there any other employees
still here?

439
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:50,363
When Hank's not around,
I'm always the last one to leave.

440
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,842
Is that the...

441
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,031
Ghost rider.

442
00:25:10,956 --> 00:25:12,806
He must have gone in there.

443
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:22,955
That's completely sealed.
There's no way he got through there.

444
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,769
Unless he can move through solids,
which, by definition, he can.

445
00:25:25,894 --> 00:25:28,208
Really?
We have to have that conversation?

446
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:29,333
Fine.

447
00:25:32,921 --> 00:25:35,292
Maybe the guy on the horse
is not a ghost.

448
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,329
And let's say he is the vandal,
which doesn't even make sense,

449
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,242
because the guy
who wanted the land is dead.

450
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:43,027
Even so, there's still something
we haven't taken into account yet.

451
00:25:43,152 --> 00:25:44,083
What's that?

452
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,587
What if McBain's murder
is related to something else?

453
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,463
Or just a random act of violence?

454
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,775
I'll go even further.

455
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,133
What if the guy on the horse
is not vandalizing the town?

456
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:54,590
What if no one is?
You said it yourself, Shawn.

457
00:25:54,715 --> 00:25:57,096
What if this place is so rundown
from neglect and old age

458
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,380
that it's falling apart, huh?

459
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:12,255
I see your point.

460
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:18,853
A ghost?

461
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:20,347
Maybe a ghost.

462
00:26:20,472 --> 00:26:22,997
Definitely not a ghost.
But a ghost-like fella.

463
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:26,459
- An ethereal moonlight figure.
- Who might be able to go through rocks.

464
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,085
But probably not.

465
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,173
I sent you out there
to investigate for 2 days,

466
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:32,173
and all you come back
with is campfire stories?

467
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,409
- Gus got the consumption.
- I did...

468
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,471
what's going on in here?

469
00:26:39,142 --> 00:26:40,287
Costume party.

470
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:43,351
And this wouldn't have anything
to do with the Old Sonora, would it?

471
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,103
Sorry, which one's Old Sonora again?

472
00:26:46,228 --> 00:26:48,396
You know,
I don't want to hear it, detective.

473
00:26:48,938 --> 00:26:51,859
And if I find out that you hired
Spencer and Guster on your own,

474
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,449
that constitutes a conflict of interest
and there will be disciplinary measures.

475
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,073
I highly recommend
that you stick to your assigned cases.

476
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:04,372
Gee, thanks for hopping in there and
taking some of the heat from the chief.

477
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:06,749
- You're very welcome.
- I was being facetious.

478
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:08,042
You wimped out.

479
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:11,629
If you believe
the short-sided pundits on CNN,

480
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,757
- but I take a longer view of history.
- That doesn't even make any sense.

481
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,672
The coroner's report said
McBain's been dead for five days.

482
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:20,925
Yet the vandalism
hasn't stopped since then.

483
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,296
Therefore,
we can effectively eliminate McBain.

484
00:27:23,421 --> 00:27:25,476
I'm now sensing that someone else

485
00:27:25,873 --> 00:27:28,646
wants that land. McBain's got the kind
of money that's tough to beat.

486
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,607
As a result, he or she...

487
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,900
Or even a he-she.

488
00:27:33,176 --> 00:27:35,027
... had to kill McBain
before he got it.

489
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,737
He was eliminating the competition.

490
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,117
Precisely.

491
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,341
Yeah, maybe.

492
00:27:42,055 --> 00:27:45,538
And when I find this murdering scum,
I'm gonna shoot him in the face.

493
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,366
Not entirely.
That's all just wishful thinking.

494
00:27:49,491 --> 00:27:51,930
We don't have the vaguest clue.
No thanks to you Spencer.

495
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:54,069
So far you've given me bubkes.

496
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,001
Get back out there,

497
00:27:56,378 --> 00:27:57,766
and get to work.

498
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,805
- He just said...
- Bubkes.

499
00:28:09,652 --> 00:28:12,808
The thing is, you never have to wonder
why Lassie doesn't have more friends.

500
00:28:15,371 --> 00:28:17,903
What are you doing here, man?
You should be resting.

501
00:28:18,592 --> 00:28:20,559
You didn't come back
for the spurs, did you?

502
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:22,742
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving town.

503
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,312
- Why?
- Well, I been licked.

504
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,188
Whole buildings
are starting to fall.

505
00:28:27,313 --> 00:28:29,876
Better I just move on
and forget the whole damn thing.

506
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:32,612
I admit, it's a long shot,

507
00:28:32,737 --> 00:28:34,962
but there's still a chance
that we could save Old Sonora.

508
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:38,528
I've seen the park they want to build.
It's a nice place.

509
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,288
And I believe that folks
are gonna want to go there.

510
00:28:41,413 --> 00:28:42,511
I'm an old relic.

511
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:45,056
I've known that for a long time.

512
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,185
Hank, we can... fix the buildings.
We'll just get some nails.

513
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,502
And febreze.

514
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,115
Fellas, that sounds awful good,
but...

515
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:56,484
no, it's too late.
I've already contacted the folks over

516
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:59,028
at Sweetwater Land
and accepted their offer.

517
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,572
Old Tripsy,
he's gonna handle the last show.

518
00:29:01,697 --> 00:29:02,865
Me, I'm done.

519
00:29:05,868 --> 00:29:07,368
I guess that's that.

520
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,036
This list of possible suspects
is garbage.

521
00:29:13,824 --> 00:29:15,513
Detectives, a moment.

522
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:16,638
Now.

523
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:22,510
Look, chief, if this is about the...

524
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,890
Chief, I just want to say that I am
100% sure that you have no proof

525
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:31,130
whatsoever that I have done anything
even remotely Old Sonora-related

526
00:29:31,255 --> 00:29:32,478
in the last two hours.

527
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,330
Sheriff Becker would like to formally
invite you into the McBain case.

528
00:29:36,717 --> 00:29:38,692
Thank god,
'cause I was totally lying just then.

529
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:44,240
- Sheriff, what can I do for ya?
- Just received the ballistics report.

530
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:46,547
The guys in our lab said
they've never seen a slug

531
00:29:46,672 --> 00:29:48,998
a slug like the one
they pulled out of McBain, and...

532
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:50,856
well, I thought...

533
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:54,182
because of your...

534
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:56,710
expertise with firearms...

535
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:00,906
maybe you could help identify it.

536
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:11,725
They've never seen a bullet like this
'cause it's over 100 years old.

537
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,397
What kind of a gun
uses a slug like that?

538
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:20,383
An original 1873 Colt peacemaker.

539
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:32,543
You sure this is all you got, Hank?
I mean, we're good on space.

540
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:36,267
We can grab you a wagon wheel.
Or that barrel.

541
00:30:41,405 --> 00:30:44,049
- I need to see your pistol.
- Why do you need to see that?

542
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,719
You don't think Hank had anything
to do with McBain's death?

543
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:49,263
- Don't be crazy. Come on.
- Shawn, stay out of this.

544
00:30:51,204 --> 00:30:52,099
Your gun.

545
00:30:54,657 --> 00:30:55,519
Slowly.

546
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:09,617
Why you been firing live rounds?

547
00:31:10,047 --> 00:31:12,161
I saw a rat, and I shot it.

548
00:31:15,455 --> 00:31:18,000
Hank Mendel, you're under arrest
for the murder of Frank McBain.

549
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,045
Come on.

550
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:21,583
Read him his rights, O'Hara.

551
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,984
You have the right
to remain silent...

552
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,745
Why do people that I try to help
usually end up getting arrested?

553
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,541
Sometimes people
you think are innocent

554
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:45,066
turn out to be guilty
and vice versa.

555
00:31:46,242 --> 00:31:49,949
The important thing is, how will you
help me get his blood out of my couch?

556
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,158
Hank is innocent.

557
00:31:51,412 --> 00:31:53,494
- Yeah, can you prove it?
- Not yet.

558
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:55,603
You wanna know what I think?

559
00:31:55,728 --> 00:31:57,790
No, I just came by
for one of your inedible,

560
00:31:57,979 --> 00:31:59,573
fat-free grilled cheese sandwiches.

561
00:31:59,698 --> 00:32:01,480
Yes, I'd like to know
what you think.

562
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:05,089
Lassiter is so emotionally invested
in trying to save this town, you,

563
00:32:05,352 --> 00:32:08,603
in trying to help him, have developed
some of the same feelings and desires.

564
00:32:08,728 --> 00:32:11,220
It's a simple case of transference.

565
00:32:12,134 --> 00:32:14,355
You don't use words
like transference.

566
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,855
Have you been
secretly hanging out with mom?

567
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,321
We may or may not have dined
together last week.

568
00:32:19,446 --> 00:32:23,274
The point is, your judgment in this case
is being clouded by your emotions.

569
00:32:23,553 --> 00:32:24,752
Dined together?

570
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:26,895
You're David Niven now?
That's your new thing?

571
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,301
You think Hank is innocent, go back
to Old Sonora and get a proof,

572
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:32,658
but this time, don't look at the town
as this magical place

573
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:34,593
that means so much to Lassiter.

574
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:36,453
Instead, look at it
for what it really is.

575
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:39,164
A dump that probably
isn't worth saving.

576
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:44,081
We've been looking for over an hour.
I need a break.

577
00:32:44,206 --> 00:32:47,449
There's gotta be a logical explanation
for where they disappeared to.

578
00:32:47,574 --> 00:32:49,508
I've got one for you.
The next dimension.

579
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:52,207
Really, Winston Zeddmore?
That's what you believe, huh?

580
00:32:52,332 --> 00:32:55,598
I haven't slept in two days, Shawn.
I don't know what I believe.

581
00:32:58,283 --> 00:32:59,857
What?
What do you see?

582
00:33:00,823 --> 00:33:01,869
I'm not sure.

583
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:19,997
I think I broke my back.

584
00:33:20,256 --> 00:33:22,415
And my neck.
And my arm.

585
00:33:23,217 --> 00:33:24,227
That's nothing.

586
00:33:24,352 --> 00:33:26,038
I just bruised my coccyx.

587
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:28,349
- Say what?
- You know what I mean.

588
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:29,668
I most certainly do not.

589
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:32,165
When I get home, I'm gonna
have to rub oil on my coccyx.

590
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,104
- Oh, Gus, please.
- That's disgusting.

591
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:36,994
What? A deep-tissue massage is
definitely what my coccyx needs.

592
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,634
- Would you stop saying that word?
- Coccyx?

593
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,477
That's what it's called, Shawn.

594
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:45,526
Dude...

595
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:48,714
this must be a part
of the old mine shaft.

596
00:33:50,477 --> 00:33:53,878
It's no wonder it's not on the tour.
It's completely unauthentic.

597
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,790
Look at this.
Look at these tools.

598
00:33:56,915 --> 00:33:59,807
- They're all modern.
- It looks like they're being used.

599
00:34:00,316 --> 00:34:01,650
Let me see the light.

600
00:34:07,451 --> 00:34:08,194
Dude.

601
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:09,706
What?

602
00:34:11,075 --> 00:34:12,591
Are you kidding me?

603
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,414
That's what this whole thing
is about? Copper?

604
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,089
That's gold, Shawn.

605
00:34:18,176 --> 00:34:20,177
Oh, I guess
that would make more sense.

606
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:21,464
So I was right.

607
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:24,853
Old Sonora was never being vandalized.
At least not deliberately.

608
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:27,224
Clearly, I agree with you.

609
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,024
I just don't know why.

610
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:31,657
The theft and damage on the surface
can be explained by the fact

611
00:34:31,782 --> 00:34:33,840
that mining is going on underground.

612
00:34:33,965 --> 00:34:36,540
The stolen wood posts are being
used to prop up the shaft.

613
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:40,551
The contaminated water and the sinkholes
are common side effects of shaft mining.

614
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:44,206
The foul odor in the air
is from the exposed sulfur deposits.

615
00:34:44,428 --> 00:34:46,541
The only thing
I don't understand is,

616
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:48,460
why would a ghost
be mining for gold?

617
00:34:48,988 --> 00:34:50,828
It wasn't a ghost, Gus.

618
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,339
Then who is it?

619
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:06,145
It was the other gunfighter.

620
00:35:07,128 --> 00:35:08,230
That stinky feet guy.

621
00:35:12,796 --> 00:35:14,528
The name is stinky Pete.

622
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:20,545
Hold up!

623
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:22,912
Hold up! Hank.

624
00:35:24,033 --> 00:35:25,289
We tested your gun.

625
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:27,700
It doesn't match the slug.

626
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,156
I told you it wasn't me, Binky,

627
00:35:30,281 --> 00:35:32,306
but you don't want
to listen no more.

628
00:35:32,777 --> 00:35:34,178
Hank, I'm so sorry.

629
00:35:34,914 --> 00:35:36,416
I never should have...

630
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,515
The murder weapon's most likely
an identical twin to yours.

631
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,290
Well, actually, I think my gun
might have been part of a set.

632
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,482
It was so long ago, I'd forgotten.

633
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:54,902
Do you have any idea
who may have the other one?

634
00:35:56,444 --> 00:35:58,081
As a matter of fact, I do.

635
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,576
How you doing over there?

636
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,746
Now I have a throbbing headache
and a throbbing coccyx.

637
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:08,558
What?

638
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,292
Who are you really?

639
00:36:10,778 --> 00:36:11,911
I'm a psychic.

640
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,339
And I can see everything
very clearly now.

641
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,342
Just like Tripsy,
you were on McBain's payroll.

642
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,326
When you went looking
for safety violations,

643
00:36:20,451 --> 00:36:22,428
you decided to check out
the old mine shaft,

644
00:36:22,553 --> 00:36:25,599
and, as dumb luck would have it,
you found yourself a previously

645
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:27,768
undiscovered vein of gold.

646
00:36:28,676 --> 00:36:31,855
What's more, you were the rider
that we saw last night.

647
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,192
Pulling wood into the entrance
of the mine,

648
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:36,862
which only appeared to be sealed.

649
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:39,474
'cause neither Hank
nor anyone else thought to check

650
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,155
if the rocks were actually real.

651
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,725
I got to hand it to you, Pete.

652
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,245
It was quite a nifty operation
you had going here.

653
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:47,745
Still do.

654
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,914
Unfortunately,
McBain got what he needed

655
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:54,849
to ensure that hank would fail
the upcoming safety inspection

656
00:36:54,974 --> 00:36:56,671
so Old Sonora had to close down.

657
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,912
When McBain took ownership
out of foreclosure,

658
00:37:00,037 --> 00:37:01,787
it wouldn't take long for his crew

659
00:37:01,912 --> 00:37:04,771
to discover your gold strike,
so to slow things down

660
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,397
and give yourself more time
to mine, well,

661
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:11,073
you went ahead and killed McBain.

662
00:37:11,614 --> 00:37:12,857
I could deny it,

663
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:16,108
but then there ain't much point,
is there?

664
00:37:16,722 --> 00:37:18,845
There's more than a million
dollars' gold in here.

665
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,071
Not only are you a murderer,
but you're a thief.

666
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:23,965
This gold belongs to Hank,
a man who's been more

667
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,159
than fair and generous
with all of his employees,

668
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:28,036
including yourself.

669
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,101
Well, I guess after playing
a bad guy all these years,

670
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,430
the line between actor
and role got kind of blurred.

671
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:40,217
They say the same thing
happened to Yul Brynner.

672
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,658
This is not good.

673
00:38:11,149 --> 00:38:12,474
Dude, what are you doing?

674
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,042
It worked for Tim Robbins
in <i>Shawshank Redemption</i>, Shawn.

675
00:38:15,414 --> 00:38:16,960
Get busy living or get busy dying.

676
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:19,338
Gus, we don't have years
to dig a tunnel.

677
00:38:19,724 --> 00:38:21,548
Besides, it makes me Morgan Freeman.

678
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:23,102
That's weird.

679
00:38:29,232 --> 00:38:30,348
Wait a minute.

680
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,162
That's water.

681
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:34,910
Dude, give me the pickaxe.

682
00:38:38,057 --> 00:38:39,205
Watch yourself.

683
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,658
You see what I see?

684
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,538
Stop pushing, Shawn.

685
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:56,251
Dude, this tunnel's
only big enough for one person.

686
00:39:10,101 --> 00:39:11,285
Pete Dillingham!

687
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,687
You're under arrest for the murder
of Frank McBain.

688
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:19,856
Throw your weapon down
and come peacefully.

689
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:41,625
How can you tell which one's the bad guy
if they're both wearing black?

690
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,707
I'm the good guy,
you toothless hillbillies.

691
00:40:23,706 --> 00:40:27,049
Though I did just shoot
that man for real, so clear on out.

692
00:40:29,353 --> 00:40:31,553
Well, the great news is,
with all the money you'll make

693
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,072
from selling gold,
you can fix up Old Sonora,

694
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:35,599
restore it to its former glory.

695
00:40:36,022 --> 00:40:37,247
I don't know, Binky.

696
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:39,873
I've been thinking maybe it's time

697
00:40:39,998 --> 00:40:42,189
this old cowboy hung up his spurs.

698
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:46,398
I guess I could take comfort
in the fact that...

699
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:48,820
I've lasted this long.

700
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:51,990
Well, and that you're
about to be filthy rich.

701
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,116
Well, that too.

702
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:56,102
I'm gonna miss this place.

703
00:40:56,227 --> 00:40:59,122
Hank, you been
a damn good friend to me.

704
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,192
You've been more than a friend.

705
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,671
Yeah, them are hard
to come by these days.

706
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:10,634
Now if you'll excuse me,
I got myself

707
00:41:10,994 --> 00:41:15,297
a wayward and wild woman
to ask to marry me.

708
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:17,040
What?

709
00:41:22,872 --> 00:41:23,763
Look at that.

710
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,302
She's about to give up
the world's oldest profession.

711
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,412
She was never a real madam, Shawn.
You do know that.

712
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:34,908
Agree to disagree.

713
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:37,994
By the way, you ever call me
Binky again, I'll shoot you.

714
00:41:38,424 --> 00:41:39,412
Understood.

715
00:41:39,726 --> 00:41:42,167
How about once more,
just for old times' sake?
