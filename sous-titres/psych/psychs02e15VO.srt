1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,133
Shawn,

2
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:11,457
where's that nice new sweater vest your
mom just put on you for picture day?

3
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:15,029
Yeah, that.

4
00:00:16,306 --> 00:00:18,069
It wasn't working for us.

5
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:21,632
We chose the knight rider shirt instead.
Mom loves K.I.T.T.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,521
Do you know how a cop distinguishes
when somebody's lying?

7
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:27,780
When it sounds like that.

8
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:30,028
Go upstairs, put the vest back on.

9
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:32,907
Pictures last forever, Shawn.
I want you to look your best.

10
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,389
There's a body in a service elevator?

11
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:42,665
No bodies.

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,459
- A dogfighting ring? <i>A missing snowman?
</i>- No.

13
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,129
Yes, a snowman is missing,
but we're not on that case. Relax.

14
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,789
- I am not working.
- I know you aren'T.

15
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:51,259
I do not work on my birthday.

16
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:52,949
I think you've made your position
clear on that.

17
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,124
- Then tell me where we're going.
- That's not how a surprise works.

18
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,606
Happy birthday, dude.

19
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,029
Welcome to the fall line launch party
for Ciao clothing.

20
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:05,519
Gorgeous models, fake celebrities.

21
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:06,709
No food, though.

22
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:08,919
This is the most exclusive
event of the year.

23
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,420
What's the Rub?

24
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:14,329
I think you're in the wrong line there,
gentlemen.

25
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:16,646
- I think we're on the V.I.P List.
- Names?

26
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:18,579
Black and Tan.

27
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,070
- First names?
- No first names.

28
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,189
One of us is Black,
and one of us is Tan.

29
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:24,899
- We're a modeling team.
- Perhaps you've heard of us.

30
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,509
Let's just go.

31
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:27,619
We're retired.

32
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:29,456
Just check your list.

33
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:37,636
Holy crap, it is here.

34
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:39,649
Sorry for the mix-up, Tan.

35
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:41,086
I beg your pardon?

36
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:42,778
My name is Black.

37
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:43,956
His name is Tan.

38
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:46,713
I can't believe you just made
that assumption.

39
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:49,910
You should be ashamed of yourself
and your family.

40
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:54,449
Okay, how did you pull that off?

41
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:56,679
Well, Ciao's number
was in the phone book.

42
00:01:56,699 --> 00:02:00,089
I don't ever want to hear again that
my Filipino accent doesn't work magic.

43
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:04,010
This is one of the most thoughtful
presents anyone's ever given me.

44
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:09,974
Man, that's Berlinda Desidovicz!

45
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:11,016
The waitress?

46
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:13,006
She's not a waitress,
she's the model.

47
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:14,629
The one from the Floppy cakes ad.

48
00:02:14,649 --> 00:02:17,339
The third girl on the left
on that billboard I always point out.

49
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:19,972
- You know her name?
- Her name? I know her life story.

50
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:22,199
She has a fan club.
Well, she's putting one together.

51
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:24,082
I'm number one on the interest list.

52
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:27,919
She's one of the most popular models in the
entire Santa Barbara downtown area, Shawn.

53
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:30,929
I've been in love with her since
the icy pops ad.

54
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:34,479
- She's the one that says "gooey".
- " Yes, she's the "gooey" girl.

55
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:37,800
This is Huge for you, man.
I'll hook it up.

56
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:40,903
I can take care of this myself.
What you think?

57
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:42,685
Should I pull out the Cheetah?

58
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:47,299
The Cheetah is the worst name for a
pickup move in the history of Mankind.

59
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,119
Remember the rule:
Treat a woman like a person,

60
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:54,039
then a Princess, then a greek goddess,
then a person again.

61
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:55,699
Besides, I think operation:

62
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:58,699
Colonel Sugarlemons is a much
better move for a place like this.

63
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,721
Cool.

64
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,112
Good luck.

65
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:15,241
Emily!

66
00:03:15,614 --> 00:03:17,150
Ladies and gentlemen,

67
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:21,228
our Chairman and Founder,
Gregor UWE steeb.

68
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,146
Ciao!

69
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,520
Ciao!

70
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:44,092
Do not worry.

71
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:47,090
I will, Raise this myself.

72
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,623
I'm only the head of the company, and
after doing all the design work myself,

73
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:55,038
I was looking forward
to some menial work.

74
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,825
Gregor!

75
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:05,531
Oh my god!

76
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:07,401
Gregor!

77
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,896
Gregor!

78
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:13,760
You absolutely sure you
don't want to work tonight?

79
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,481
Saison 2 - Episode 15

83
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,568
You expect us to believe that you model?

84
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:47,411
What, that's hard to believe?

85
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:51,579
What, me and my bro here aren't worthy
of leering into a little camera lens

86
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:53,419
or blue-steeling it up occasionally?

87
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,021
Your bro, of course.

88
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:56,657
His features are immaculate.

89
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:57,999
But you...

90
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,233
not so much.

91
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:00,447
What?

92
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:02,049
What are you, insane?

93
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,967
Help, help me out here, Tan.

94
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:06,419
- He's a foot model.
- Well, that makes sense.

95
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:08,331
Really, thanks for that.

96
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:09,526
He's lying.

97
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:12,045
It was
foot and...

98
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:13,668
ankle.

99
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:17,201
And I did some hand work, okay?

100
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:18,928
Perhaps you recognize this...

101
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,676
from the insurance commercials.

102
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:24,224
I have to go to the bathroom.
Want to come?

103
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:25,818
- Okay.
- Ciao.

104
00:05:27,174 --> 00:05:29,679
She seems so bored. So lonely.

105
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,113
Yeah, but so does everybody here, dude.

106
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:36,018
Did you notice that the mike stand was set
too low when Gregor came out on the stage?

107
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:39,175
Why would the mike stand be set so low when
he's the only one who was gonna speak tonight?

108
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:41,711
- Do you see the clock?
- But what if we stumble upon something huge?

109
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:43,315
What does the clock say, Shawn?

110
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,045
- Fine.
- Thank. Never mind.

111
00:05:46,122 --> 00:05:48,209
It's your birthday. No work, got it.

112
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:50,959
All right, you will each, one by one,
go to the area I've

113
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:54,039
sequestered, state the name of the
agency you work for and.

114
00:05:54,544 --> 00:05:55,788
Why am I surprised?

115
00:05:55,808 --> 00:05:58,254
Usually it's because
just tell me if you've seen anything.

116
00:05:58,299 --> 00:06:00,469
Maybe.
Do you suspect foul play?

117
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:03,169
Not really.
There's no one here with an iq over 40.

118
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:05,459
So you're asking for our help.

119
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:08,529
Never mind.

120
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:11,339
We're not available tonight.

121
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:14,618
Wide open tomorrow, though.
What is this about, Shawn?

122
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:17,068
Look, my dad insisted
I return these by 8:00 A.M.

123
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:19,998
I don't know about you, I plan
on sleeping in till at least noon.

124
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:22,211
- Especially after we howl all night.
- Whoa.

125
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:24,153
I think somebody's in there.

126
00:06:25,227 --> 00:06:26,616
No, that can't be.

127
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:31,311
Dude, it's 10:43.

128
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:33,319
He's easily been asleep for two hours.

129
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:35,246
No, I think it's a woman.
Listen.

130
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,481
See there is someone here.

131
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,551
Mr. Spencer.

132
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,688
How unexpected.

133
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:44,317
Chief?

134
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:49,609
I just came by to leave these
half boots on the door mat.

135
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,128
I didn't see anything.

136
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,519
Mr Spencer, please come in.

137
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,723
Come in.

138
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,741
Mr Guster.

139
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,199
I just thought I'd bring my dear
friend Susan over to meet your father.

140
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:10,938
She's a lovely,
single woman who works at city hall.

141
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,258
Excuse me.

142
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:20,512
O'hara, this better be big.

143
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,038
You're still at Ciao?

144
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,541
The electrical cabling's
been tampered with?

145
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,989
Okay.
Well, this case just changed.

146
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,435
- Dude...
- I will kill you, Shawn.

147
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,125
All right, get any potentials down
to the station. I am on my way.

148
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,709
You be okay?

149
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:38,201
Okay. Bye.

150
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,099
Bye, Henry. Thank you.

151
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:43,558
- What are you doing here?
- Well, we

152
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:46,269
didn't realize it was ladies night
at club Henry.

153
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:49,620
So I dropped by to return
your half boots.

154
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:52,809
Wow, Henry,
that's some wild-looking footwear.

155
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:53,757
Yeah...

156
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,095
- Susan, this is my son Shawn and, Gus.
- Nice to meet you.

157
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:59,775
You can call me sue.

158
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,700
Most people call me sue B.

159
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:03,879
Because there are
two sues at the office.

160
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:07,344
But obviously that's not really
a factor here.

161
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,589
Could you

162
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:16,242
help me in the kitchen with these?

163
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:17,999
We'll be right back.

164
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,248
So...

165
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:25,214
heard about pluto?

166
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:27,225
That's messed up.

167
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:29,076
Yeah.

168
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,226
Really, dad?

169
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:37,209
Cheese cubes and wieners?
What's happening here?

170
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:38,872
Is this some sort of blind date?

171
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:41,535
Sort of.
I don't know.

172
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,591
She's just...

173
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,617
what do you call it? Nondescript.

174
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,093
"Nondescript"?

175
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,129
I've never heard a woman described like
that unless she was a Robbery suspect.

176
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:52,935
I just don't know.
I mean, she's pretty.

177
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:54,719
She's a little boring and prim.

178
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:56,165
I cubed these myself.

179
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:57,639
She didn't even try one.

180
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:59,319
What do you think?
What's your opinion?

181
00:08:59,357 --> 00:09:01,512
I have no opinion
of any kind whats oever.

182
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:04,846
Shawn, come on. You have an opinion on
everything. Especially when it comes to women.

183
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:06,651
- Just give me your first impression.
- No.

184
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:08,066
Why not?

185
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:10,389
You have to get over this.

186
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:12,179
Nobody wants to grow old alone.

187
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:14,108
Maybe a nice lady will
help him relax a little.

188
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:15,461
New subject, Gus.

189
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:18,194
Did you see the chief run out of there?

190
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,911
Must be something big.

191
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:22,653
You know, I was thinking, there's
only 73 minutes left in your birthday.

192
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,479
- Actually, 72 minutes.
- Not until midnight, Shawn.

193
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,389
I'm Cinderella, and this is my ball.

194
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:30,959
And I'm not lifting a finger until my
carriage turns into a big-ass pumpkin.

195
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:33,570
-Got it? <i>Good.</i>
-Got it.

196
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:44,024
Thank you.

197
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,776
Okay,
where do you want all these people?

198
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:59,309
Just put 'em in both interrogation
rooms and we'll rove it.

199
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:00,579
Let's go, go, go!

200
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,379
So the electrical cable
offstage was deliberately severed.

201
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,339
The chief thinks it was done pro.

202
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:13,858
That means...

203
00:10:15,752 --> 00:10:17,102
6-5.

204
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,416
You don't remember where
you were this afternoon?

205
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:24,791
It was yellow.

206
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:26,531
And boring.

207
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:29,332
Are we talking about a restaurant?

208
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,112
I don't know, maybe.

209
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:33,164
Just write down that it was lame.

210
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,636
I do like that jacket.

211
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:39,067
Really?

212
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,663
Somewhere a transient
is shivering in the night.

213
00:10:42,862 --> 00:10:43,788
Detective.

214
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:06,324
Fine, tell me what you got.

215
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,639
How's it going, crime fighters?

216
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:14,429
They're not very forthcoming...
or bright.

217
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:16,849
One of them cannot confirm
the correct spelling of his own name.

218
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:19,880
Did you by chance interview a model
named Berlinda? Is she still around?

219
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,345
Gus, we don't have time for this.

220
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:23,591
I know, and that's why
I'm here to offer our services.

221
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,129
I'd rather shower with a bear.

222
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:28,279
Look, they're only gonna
talk to their own kind. Okay?

223
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:30,907
Shallow, judgmental, cruel,
and Gorgeous.

224
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:32,379
We're already embedded.

225
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,609
What do you mean "embedded"?

226
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:37,709
Chief, we may or may not have used
deception to get into the party tonight.

227
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:39,399
See you at swimwear wednesday.

228
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:41,831
- Don't let 'em scare you, Tan.
- He's tan.

229
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:46,421
- They think we're models.
- They think I'm a model.

230
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:47,681
- Me too.
- A foot model.

231
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:51,656
And ankle, Gus! Dude, that's just ridiculous
anyway. Everybody look at my jaw.

232
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,467
Well, I've seen enough.
You're hired.

233
00:11:56,569 --> 00:11:57,399
What?

234
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:00,450
Hired. You can look the word up.
Change that tie, detective.

235
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,889
Now, Mr Spencer, if you have a moment,
I'd like to see you privately.

236
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:05,590
Of course, Chief.

237
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,139
Ciaobella and Gregor
are home grown celebrities.

238
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,439
The local media is sharpening
its pencils on this one.

239
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:16,574
And that is not the kind of press that
this department or its interim chief needs.

240
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:18,714
- Do I make myself clear.
- Clear as a crystal ball.

241
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:20,301
Good. So tell me...

242
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,124
did your father say anything
about my friend Susan?

243
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,769
They all live here?

244
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:31,651
Well, Gregor owns the building.

245
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,489
The Ciao studio's across the street.

246
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:36,284
He uses this loft for his prime models.

247
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:38,319
I wonder if it looks like
the loft in head over heels.

248
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,998
You, and only you, can confirm that.

249
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:43,859
My Husband's funeral
is tomorrow at 12:25.

250
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,604
Be there no later than...

251
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:46,814
1:15.

252
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,619
And I'll have to approve
whatever you're wearing.

253
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:50,860
Now, obviously,

254
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,609
we have no choice but to continue with
the fall line unveiling on wednesday.

255
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:58,472
Ma'am, before we move on,
should I hire someone to do Magnolias

256
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:01,619
- tomorrow for the service?
- Well, of course hire someone, Emily!

257
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,445
It's not like they grow on trees.

258
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:09,809
That marriage always seemed weird to me.

259
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:11,940
Like when Liza Minnelli
married David gest.

260
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,420
Yeah, well, Ciaobella and
Gregor lasted eight years, Gus.

261
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,539
I suspect that some of those marble-chiseled
simpletons are more devious than they let on.

262
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:24,450
We're gonna have to dig deep and
blend in in order to get real answers.

263
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,604
Dude, you thought I was
gonna have trouble blending in?

264
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,529
I have this shirt, this shirt.

265
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:30,913
Most of these shirts.

266
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,096
And these are my exact kenneth coles.

267
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:37,129
And that picture of my mom
parasailing in Montego bay.

268
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,855
You moved me in?

269
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,816
Dude, we got Lucky.
They just threw some guy out.

270
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:42,943
Now we can live it up
chic while we catch a killer.

271
00:13:42,963 --> 00:13:45,776
- Now help me set up my clapper.
- I'm not moving in here, Shawn.

272
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:48,109
I don't care how many secrets
we uncover.

273
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:49,543
Shower's free.

274
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:52,051
I got the window.

275
00:13:57,615 --> 00:13:59,120
You must be sigrid.

276
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,212
- What is that, Cossack?
- Die.

277
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,066
You can question her.
You know who I'm questioning.

278
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,829
What's up, Roomies?

279
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:10,097
Initiation.

280
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:11,491
That's what.

281
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:13,134
Put 'em up.

282
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:15,869
- I'm allergic to pillows.
-Tommy John, Both Elbows.

283
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,229
Come on.

284
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:18,588
Give me your best shot...

285
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:19,853
black.

286
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,245
It would really behoove you guys
to get our names right in the future.

287
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,235
Good. Berlinda, you're here.

288
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:33,274
Look, we are so out of the loop.

289
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,391
You gotta catch us up on everything,
you know.

290
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:38,169
The dead Gregor thing,
that awful Ciaobella.

291
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:40,713
- The agency.
- Maybe we can play truth or dare.

292
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,630
Actually, we were thinking about
maybe going to a bar, doing some 02.

293
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,444
Couldn't we do that after we talk?
Because I know I have so many questions.

294
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:49,384
I could be ready in three minutes.

295
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,379
Shawn!

296
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,240
Dad?

297
00:15:32,644 --> 00:15:33,889
How did you find me?

298
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:36,893
Shawn, I was a detective for 15 years.
You're not hard to find.

299
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:38,673
Was that guy wearing a BRA?

300
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:40,822
Could possibly be so important
that you're here right now?

301
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:42,268
It's Karen's friend Susan.

302
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:45,479
She called again.
Twice in the last two days.

303
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:47,109
Doesn't that reek of desperation?

304
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:49,026
No, no, no. This is not happening.

305
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:50,899
Shawn, this is ridiculous!

306
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:54,165
You come to me for advice on one of
your stupid cases at least once a week.

307
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:57,339
I ask for a simple assist on dating
protocol, you can't give it to me?

308
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:01,439
Call me old-fashioned, Shawn. I haven't
been pursued by a woman in 33 years.

309
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:04,096
- It used to be the other way around, you know.
- Okay, fine, dad, look.

310
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:06,289
Women your age,
they don't have time to play games.

311
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:07,929
She was wearing a cardigan!

312
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:11,118
But she saw the inside of your house,
and didn't run screaming in horror.

313
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:13,711
Ride the upside. Now, I can't talk about
this for one more second

314
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:16,353
because I'm proud of the fact
that I have never been in therapy, okay?

315
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:17,203
Shawn, no!

316
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,138
- Hello.
- Dude, what the hell happened to you guys?

317
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,279
Some of the models got creeped out that
you hang with your dad all the time.

318
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,138
- What?
- All right, fine!

319
00:16:45,216 --> 00:16:49,339
We were afraid if we hung out with
him any longer, we might catch wrinkles.

320
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,989
Just tell me where you're going.

321
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:54,179
- Shawn, I can't talk now.
- Gus, you're not being helpful.

322
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:55,595
And we have a case to...

323
00:16:55,969 --> 00:16:56,915
Solve.

324
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,097
Miss Bloom.

325
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:21,376
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

326
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,531
- I'm black...
- I know who you are.

327
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,944
You're staying at the loft.

328
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:28,275
You're the one no one
believes used to be a model.

329
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:30,366
Who's saying these things?

330
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,714
I believe you.

331
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:33,901
Thank you.

332
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,133
I think your ankles are magnificent.

333
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:38,912
Well, I play a lot of ping-pong.

334
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,439
Wow, these are really good.

335
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:50,929
Thank you.

336
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,642
I've never really shown
them to anyone before.

337
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:54,746
Why not?

338
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,502
I'd totally wear these.

339
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,129
- This if I was very confused.
- Yes.

340
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:04,053
You know, I just let Gregor
and Ciaobella do the designs.

341
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:06,341
It's Ciaobella's company now.

342
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,850
Well, my lunch break is over.

343
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,979
It's after 9:00.

344
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:13,597
Yeah, I kinda work long hours.

345
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,847
I'm just so far behind,
Ciaobella's gonna freak.

346
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,967
I've gotta get back to work.

347
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,752
Will I see you tomorrow at the
funeral?

348
00:18:24,963 --> 00:18:26,738
Yes,
definitely.

349
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:28,454
I'm, yeah.
I think so, yeah.

350
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,632
Good.

351
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:34,811
Don't work too hard.

352
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:48,949
Hi, you've reached burton Guster
with central coast pharmaceuticals.

353
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:51,263
Leave me a message
and I'll get back to you.

354
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:52,849
Straight to voice mail?

355
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:54,452
That's how we're doing it now?

356
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:57,319
One moderately hot chick comes by,
and suddenly I'm invisible?

357
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,864
You know what, Gus?
That's fine.

358
00:18:58,922 --> 00:19:00,559
I'm taking the bunk next to the window.

359
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:04,255
And don't be surprised if your
pillow smells faintly of my butt.

360
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,561
What is this?

361
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:34,579
Did you guys get up at dawn? Dude,
you couldn't give me a little shake?

362
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,243
We got up five minutes ago.

363
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,065
Sigrid, we can all go together.

364
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:41,550
I would rather eat my own earlobes

365
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,724
than spend another hour
with you callous monsters.

366
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,001
That girl's acting like a freak.

367
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,099
Did you accomplish anything last night
besides selling me out for vacant head?

368
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,409
Yes, I did.

369
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:07,659
I found out that Berlinda always
wanted a pet dwarf Bunny as a child.

370
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,324
And she loves anything that
smells and looks like lavender.

371
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,399
Sweet.

372
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,119
Let's call the chief and get paid.

373
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:16,259
I also found out that Ciaobella
was grilling all of the models

374
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,256
because she was convinced that
one of them was sleeping with Gregor.

375
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,922
- Really?
- yep.

376
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:24,644
Well that coupled with the
fact that she's drunk with power,

377
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:28,699
treating her sweet little assistant like dirt,
give us a pretty good suspect, I'd say.

378
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,033
Let's crash a funeral.

379
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:39,387
Oh, my god.

380
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,566
Is he wearing Hugo Boss?

381
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,469
What a sellout!

382
00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:45,258
See you never.

383
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,189
Good night forever...

384
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:48,987
you bald bastard.

385
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,854
Hold on.

386
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,292
It was me
who peed in the hot tub.

387
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,244
Okay...

388
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:04,733
You reap what you sow, Uwe Steeb.
Remember that.

389
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:08,711
You don't even know that dude.

390
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:10,197
I'm in character, Shawn.

391
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:12,929
Besides, Berlinda's listening. Shut up.

392
00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:15,318
You know what, man?

393
00:21:15,438 --> 00:21:16,909
I didn't want to tell you this.

394
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:19,706
Berlinda's the one that
couldn't spell her own name.

395
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:21,026
So?

396
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:23,292
You don't know her like I do, Shawn.

397
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,808
- Dude!
- What?

398
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:30,614
That was a love note.
That's a love note. That's a love note.

399
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:33,775
She just hid a love note in the casket.
That means Sigrid was Gregor's mistress.

400
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:36,283
Ciaobella found out
about it and killed him. I got it!

401
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:40,618
- You can't dance at a funeral, Shawn.
- All of a sudden you're the arbiter of good taste?

402
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:43,700
We wait until it's over, and we do it
without blowing my cover to Berlinda.

403
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,319
She only dates models.

404
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:49,238
Fine, I'll call Jules.

405
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:56,912
Well, thank you all for coming.

406
00:21:58,028 --> 00:22:01,440
We gather today not to mourn the passing

407
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,754
of my dead husband... Hassenfeffer!

408
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:07,339
But rather to celebrate

409
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:09,954
all that he once was.

410
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,367
While I will always Miss

411
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,670
Gregor Uwe Steeb...

412
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,828
Whose real name was
Gregory Lapspanksi...

413
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:27,959
I encourage you all not to cry...

414
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:32,353
But to drink and laugh and dance

415
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:35,163
as we remember a man who once thought

416
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:39,105
a belt made of dried bits of
panther was a good idea.

417
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,021
Good-bye, my love.

418
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:44,885
Gregor...

419
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:52,131
She's really planting one on him?

420
00:22:54,313 --> 00:22:55,564
Miss Masterson?

421
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,245
Ciaobella?

422
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:00,621
Ciaobella?

423
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,391
I've changed my mind.

424
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:15,287
It wasn't the wife.

425
00:23:21,163 --> 00:23:24,836
I loved Gregor, and he loved me.

426
00:23:24,856 --> 00:23:28,218
But he wasn't gonna leave his wife, and
you never learned to share as a child,

427
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:30,085
so you went ahead and killed them both.

428
00:23:30,205 --> 00:23:31,292
For symmetry.

429
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:32,469
Sound about right?

430
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:34,655
No, it wasn't like that.

431
00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:37,221
I mean, sure, it was frustrating.

432
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:40,145
I couldn't say anything about her
without him flying off the handle.

433
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:42,855
He wouldn't even let me drink
out of the same glass as her.

434
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,773
He said that comparing me to her

435
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:49,666
was like comparing Cleopatra
to Miss Cleo.

436
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:53,169
- You think Berlinda's back at the loft?
- That analogy doesn't make any sense.

437
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:55,169
It would if you knew
who either of them were.

438
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,442
But I was sharing.

439
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,945
I accepted it.

440
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:01,683
A piece of him was enough.

441
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:03,740
I mean, it was that or nothing.

442
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:07,231
I Miss him so much.

443
00:24:08,462 --> 00:24:10,750
He was the only one that knew how

444
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,663
to accentuate my shoulders

445
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:15,855
to make my waist and hips look smaller.

446
00:24:18,595 --> 00:24:21,683
You realize you had more motive

447
00:24:21,803 --> 00:24:24,184
- than anyone, Sigrid.
- No.

448
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:27,741
Now Emily Bloom has taken over
sole creative control

449
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:30,423
of Ciao.
I mean, she inherits everything.

450
00:24:30,543 --> 00:24:31,655
Emily Bloom?

451
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:34,228
- Who?
- The mousy assistant?

452
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,917
She started as an assistant.
That's just how they treated her.

453
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:38,796
But she's third in line.

454
00:24:39,028 --> 00:24:40,212
Interesting.

455
00:24:40,332 --> 00:24:42,512
She failed to mention
that little factoid.

456
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:46,589
- Is that the same suit...
- Yes, okay? It is!

457
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:49,244
I can get more than one wearing
out of a suit in a work week.

458
00:24:49,264 --> 00:24:51,862
- It's the same tie.
- Get out of here!

459
00:24:52,552 --> 00:24:56,053
Don't go getting any ideas about
hopping a plane to trinidad and tobago.

460
00:24:56,173 --> 00:24:58,204
You're not out of the woods yet, missy.

461
00:25:03,203 --> 00:25:05,487
- What's the plan, Stan?
- Go away.

462
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,224
The reason we brought you in on this case
was so that people would stop dying.

463
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:10,789
O'Hara, get down to Ciao. I want you
to put the clamps on Miss Bloom,

464
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,451
our little kiwi ladder climber.

465
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:13,888
Check.

466
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:20,321
Then I will pay the penalty
to terminate the contract.

467
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:22,548
William, will you please make sure

468
00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:25,402
those pleather samples make it
to Alicia Silverstone before 3:00.

469
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:27,105
Don't even give it another thought.

470
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,457
No, a bunny does not need
to go blind in order to confirm

471
00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:32,958
that our buyers should not
eat our clothing.

472
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:35,841
How would you like it if
I doused your retina in henna,

473
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:37,483
you cro-magnon piece of...

474
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:40,122
- I'm detective O'Hara from the...
- Screw you!

475
00:25:40,925 --> 00:25:43,317
Let's acknowledge the curve, Samantha.

476
00:25:43,437 --> 00:25:45,349
You know, real women, real figures.

477
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:47,665
Just raise the waist line.
Make it an "a" cut.

478
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:50,829
And don't think for one second
I didn't notice your new bangs.

479
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,779
- You look 21 again.
- Miss Bloom, I need to ask you a few questions.

480
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,467
And we're walking.

481
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:58,519
We believe that both your predecessors
were killed by the same person.

482
00:25:58,639 --> 00:26:01,214
And no one stood to gain more
than I did by killing them both?

483
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:03,372
Well, I'm glad you can see
where this is headed.

484
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,845
- I'll need you to account for your whereabouts.
- Now it's just the protype,

485
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:08,802
but I've never wanted to be
a woman this badly in my life.

486
00:26:09,557 --> 00:26:11,667
Okay. Can you try these on?

487
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,878
I don't think that's appropriate.

488
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,207
Wait, excuse me! What?

489
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,327
These are fabulous.

490
00:26:32,084 --> 00:26:34,801
Now, are we talking
in your office or mine?

491
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:36,920
Okay, back to work, everybody.

492
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,235
William, order pizza for everybody.

493
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:41,260
That yummy place with the soy Ricotta.

494
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,614
Thank you.

495
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,790
Well, this is my office, so fire away.

496
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,841
You've been head of this company
for six hours,

497
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:50,418
and you've changed
just about everything.

498
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:53,108
You're not exactly preserving
the ciao legacy.

499
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:56,167
You know, I have all these things
I've always wanted to do.

500
00:26:56,287 --> 00:26:59,496
And I'm turning the company green.
I'm ending animal testing.

501
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:03,143
Subsidizing proceeds to help
find a cure for breast cancer.

502
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:06,094
Do any of those sound
like bad things to you?

503
00:27:06,214 --> 00:27:08,057
Unfortunately, that's not an alibi.

504
00:27:08,177 --> 00:27:09,460
No, it isn't.

505
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,167
And what's more,
I don't think I have one.

506
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:14,897
I mean, I was with them
all day every day.

507
00:27:15,203 --> 00:27:16,520
I see.

508
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:18,871
Well, I'm sure you won't mind
if I have a look around

509
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:20,635
and chat with a few of your employees?

510
00:27:20,755 --> 00:27:22,223
No, of course not.

511
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,565
That's it, Miss Bloom.

512
00:27:27,308 --> 00:27:28,587
Detective...

513
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:30,582
Aren't you forgetting something?

514
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,011
Right.

515
00:27:35,668 --> 00:27:38,156
You know, you have such great lines.

516
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:41,228
There's no reason why
you can't dress to arrest.

517
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,498
Is there?

518
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,642
All right, what do we know
about Emily Bloom?

519
00:27:52,762 --> 00:27:54,766
Well, she wrote, are you there, god?

520
00:27:54,886 --> 00:27:56,984
It's me Margaret, and freckle juice.

521
00:27:57,104 --> 00:27:59,063
I think that was Judy Bloom.

522
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:02,415
- Then I got nothin'.
- Could you possibly be bringing less

523
00:28:02,435 --> 00:28:05,108
- to the table right now?
- Shawn, you're just upset because

524
00:28:05,128 --> 00:28:07,019
- I'm more than a pair of ankles.
- I don't get it.

525
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,894
Emily Bloom was the vice
President of the company,

526
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:11,300
yet she was running coffee
and balancing the books?

527
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:14,679
Dude, are you oiling your head.

528
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:17,318
Lavender.

529
00:28:17,438 --> 00:28:19,329
Berlinda likes her men to shine.

530
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:25,905
Chief.

531
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:29,062
Mr. Spencer, I'm going to ask you a
very important question,

532
00:28:29,182 --> 00:28:31,411
- and I'd appreciate some candor.
- Shoot.

533
00:28:31,431 --> 00:28:34,878
Has your father lost his mind? I mean,
why hasn't he called my friend Susan back?

534
00:28:34,898 --> 00:28:37,606
- Honestly, he should be so Lucky.
- Chief, I cannot get involved

535
00:28:37,726 --> 00:28:40,938
in some sort of soap opera
starring my father.

536
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:43,249
- For the record...
- Hold on.

537
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:44,715
This is vick.

538
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:46,409
He asked me out.

539
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:48,724
Wonderful! Oh, my gosh.
What did he say?

540
00:28:48,844 --> 00:28:52,039
- Oh, well, he left a message.
- Oh, yeah, that sounds like Henry.

541
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,595
- Dad?
- Should I take her to crab shack willie's

542
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:57,262
- or the third wharf?
- Those can't possibly be real places.

543
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:04,275
- Look, dad, i'm really busy, okay?
- Do not bring your purse into the restaurant.

544
00:29:04,295 --> 00:29:07,064
- Shawn, just pick a restaurant.
- Listen, I'm gonna call him back.

545
00:29:07,084 --> 00:29:08,487
Okay, call me later, Honey.

546
00:29:08,507 --> 00:29:10,644
I don't know where
you should take her to dinner!

547
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:11,758
Hold on.

548
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:13,768
That's her. Gotta go.

549
00:29:13,888 --> 00:29:15,404
- He called her.
- He called her.

550
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:17,669
Now stop messing around
and go find me a killer.

551
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,048
Good-bye.

552
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:26,344
- Am I dreaming?
- Nope.

553
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,364
I just look this good.

554
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,447
How is it possible
that I am the only sane person

555
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:33,915
- in the universe right now?
- Question...

556
00:29:34,044 --> 00:29:37,427
Do you think this shirt enhances
or detracts from my traps?

557
00:29:37,547 --> 00:29:40,117
Berlinda's going to get me
into the fashion show.

558
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:43,368
- Have you worn that before?
- Nope.

559
00:29:43,488 --> 00:29:46,760
This shirt was designed
by Gregor Uwe Steeb, Shawn.

560
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,561
It's a part of the new fall line.

561
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:50,326
I'm only the head of the company,

562
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:53,126
and after doing
all the designs myself...

563
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:55,730
- These are really good.
- Thank you.

564
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,243
I've never really shown them
to anyone before.

565
00:29:59,707 --> 00:30:01,457
That is not Gregor's design.

566
00:30:01,577 --> 00:30:04,245
- What are you talking about?
- They're stealing her designs.

567
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:05,603
- Whose?
- Emily's.

568
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:08,785
Gregor said he personally designed
the whole new line.

569
00:30:08,905 --> 00:30:11,250
He's full of it. That's Emily's.
I've seen it.

570
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,941
They're all Emily's.

571
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:16,983
Would you please put some pants on?

572
00:30:25,461 --> 00:30:28,732
The fish and chips
is actually pretty good.

573
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:30,389
I've been craving meat lately.

574
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:32,316
Well,
in that case the prime rib is excellent.

575
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:34,246
B.y.o.b. Help yourself.

576
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:37,319
- No, no, actually, I don't think it is.
- Is it hot in here?

577
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:39,258
I don't think so.
It's pretty comfortable.

578
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:41,515
Whew, that's better.

579
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,128
Don't you think?

580
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,660
- What happened to you?
- I am a woman, chief.

581
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,757
And I am choosing to dress like one.

582
00:31:25,877 --> 00:31:27,675
You can't do that, O'Hara.

583
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:30,993
I paid for it myself.
I was feeling good about myself,

584
00:31:31,113 --> 00:31:33,234
it was my lunch break and...

585
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:35,846
Carlton, is that a new tie?

586
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:37,278
Don't be ridiculous.

587
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:40,086
- I trust this is all in aid of something?
- Yes, chief.

588
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:43,195
I spent the entire afternoon at ciao,
and I am certain

589
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:45,560
that Emily Bloom is not our killer.

590
00:31:45,691 --> 00:31:47,571
I grilled her, she didn't break.

591
00:31:47,691 --> 00:31:49,669
Not to mention she has
over a dozen employees

592
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:52,976
that would take a bullet for her.
She simply doesn't have it in her

593
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:56,102
to kill somebody, much less two
somebodies. I'd bet the farm on it.

594
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:57,801
I'm sensing something.

595
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,721
Gregor and Ciaobella
were stealing Emily's designs.

596
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:04,474
Stealing them, passing them off as their own.
All the while treating her as a peon.

597
00:32:04,594 --> 00:32:06,475
That's not a bad start for motive.

598
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:08,918
Toxicology report:
Ciaobella was poisoned.

599
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:12,062
The only thing in her system were
traces of arsenic, soy milk,

600
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,028
and green superfood powder.

601
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,483
Bad news, Jules.

602
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:21,623
I think you just lost the farm.

603
00:32:23,335 --> 00:32:25,225
Would you like me
to butter your biscuit?

604
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:26,830
Excuse me?

605
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:36,014
So what's it like working for the mayor?

606
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:37,315
It's okay.

607
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:39,809
It'd be more fun
if he wasn't married though.

608
00:32:40,185 --> 00:32:41,807
So what's it like being retired?

609
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:44,366
I mean, you're not that old,
so what's the story?

610
00:32:44,486 --> 00:32:45,841
You take a slug?

611
00:32:45,961 --> 00:32:48,961
Or did you just get tired
of being good all the time?

612
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:51,569
Now be honest...

613
00:32:52,414 --> 00:32:55,602
Isn't that better
than some flaky piece of fish?

614
00:32:57,656 --> 00:32:58,935
That's good.

615
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:01,635
- Very good.
- Yeah?

616
00:33:01,755 --> 00:33:02,777
It's good.

617
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:08,549
Oh, damn it, damn it.

618
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:10,620
Damn it, I dropped my fork, I...

619
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:12,563
I'll just get one myself.

620
00:33:15,317 --> 00:33:18,380
Okay, for the record,
I still don't feel right about this.

621
00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:26,261
- Dad, I thought you were supposed to be...
- Shawn, I was wrong.

622
00:33:26,281 --> 00:33:28,069
She's like this carnivorous mink.

623
00:33:28,189 --> 00:33:30,006
She wants to eat me right here...

624
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,363
That was weird.

625
00:33:45,892 --> 00:33:47,096
Oh, come on!

626
00:34:10,602 --> 00:34:11,970
So, Shawn,

627
00:34:12,276 --> 00:34:14,272
still feel like she's our killer?

628
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,615
Threedead bodies?

629
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,207
- Detectives, go call an ambulance.
- Holy crap!

630
00:34:32,144 --> 00:34:33,330
She's stable now.

631
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,134
They've pumped her stomach.
I have a sample on the way to the lab.

632
00:34:41,443 --> 00:34:42,443
Emily.

633
00:34:44,588 --> 00:34:45,611
Black.

634
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,169
Wh-what are you doing here?

635
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:53,711
It's a long story that
you don't really need to hear.

636
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:55,099
How do you feel?

637
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,158
Not terrible. I just...
I can't remember anything

638
00:34:58,278 --> 00:35:00,444
that happened after I finished,
my dinner.

639
00:35:00,564 --> 00:35:01,955
Dinner.

640
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,324
What did you have?

641
00:35:04,094 --> 00:35:06,407
Well, the pizza was gone, so I just had

642
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:10,274
a superfood smoothie
and some tofurkey jerky.

643
00:35:10,395 --> 00:35:12,566
- Oh, my god.
- What?

644
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,971
I was really hungry,

645
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:17,826
- and I just wanted something quickly.
- No, no, no, I've gotta go solve...

646
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:20,311
I'm... I-m... I'm really glad,

647
00:35:20,431 --> 00:35:23,339
though, that you're feeling...
That you're not, um... My name is...

648
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,358
- How 'bout I come back later?
- Yeah, I'd like that.

649
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,620
Sweet!

650
00:35:31,653 --> 00:35:33,381
Gregor and Ciaobella...

651
00:35:33,524 --> 00:35:36,551
I'm all over the second and third "hows"
with these smoothies.

652
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:39,497
All the models that would have benefited
from killing Gregor and Ciaobella

653
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:41,790
have no reason to kill Emily
too, I don't think.

654
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,099
- What's the missing link?
- Right, put a pin in it, and I'll make my move

655
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,237
on Berlinda, and we'll pick
it up in the morning.

656
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:49,506
Only a few know that
their actual wedding took place

657
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:52,993
in a private ceremony
on the small bahamian island

658
00:35:53,113 --> 00:35:55,020
of abaco two years earlier.

659
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,258
Today would have been their
tenth wedding anniversary.

660
00:35:58,882 --> 00:36:00,273
Did you know that?

661
00:36:00,423 --> 00:36:03,002
No, Shawn. I'm not interested
in learning new trivia

662
00:36:03,122 --> 00:36:05,733
- about our murder victims.
- Ten years is a milestone

663
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:08,219
anniversary in this state, Gus.
Financially, it's a benchmark.

664
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,079
It means all the assets
get split right down the middle.

665
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:11,610
We're not gonna solve
this thing tonight, Shawn.

666
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,314
I know part of it.

667
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:16,343
I might even know 2/3 of it.
Dude, I could totally go up there.

668
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:19,296
- But you won't.
- All right, Spencer, we did a rush tox screen on Emily.

669
00:36:19,316 --> 00:36:22,127
You were right. She had the same poison
in her system as Ciaobella,

670
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:24,817
- but in a much higher dose.
- I definitely know 2/3 of it!

671
00:36:24,937 --> 00:36:26,813
Stop it, Shawn. Don't do it.

672
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:29,685
Don't just get up there and start
winging it. That's not how we operate.

673
00:36:29,805 --> 00:36:32,017
Dude, where have you been
for the last two years?

674
00:36:32,137 --> 00:36:34,317
Come on, Shawn. I'm so close.

675
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:44,033
- Would you tell us why we're here?
- Never afraid to take risks, Ciobella's dress

676
00:36:44,104 --> 00:36:46,346
of electric lights, set the paris

677
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:48,695
- fashion world ablaze...
- Oh, my god,

678
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:50,897
this is a doozy. I mean, wow.

679
00:36:51,017 --> 00:36:54,594
Establishing her as one
of the top designers working today.

680
00:36:59,346 --> 00:37:01,236
Stop the projector.

681
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:08,289
Or... or just keep it going.
That's... that's fine.

682
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:10,882
I know this may be hard
for some of you to believe,

683
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:12,981
but I'm not really black.

684
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:14,688
And I'm not a model.

685
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:17,257
My partner Gus and I are detectives.

686
00:37:17,377 --> 00:37:18,556
You're not a model?

687
00:37:18,676 --> 00:37:20,259
I'm only a detective part-time.

688
00:37:20,379 --> 00:37:22,716
And my full name is Tan Gus.

689
00:37:26,117 --> 00:37:28,039
Ciaobella Masterson was murdered

690
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,096
by her husband, Gregor Uwe Steeb.

691
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:32,544
Wait, wait, wait.

692
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:34,078
That doesn't make any sense.

693
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,855
Gregor was already dead.

694
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:38,712
Do I come down to your office and
bother you while you're working?

695
00:37:38,732 --> 00:37:40,035
All the time.

696
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:42,806
That's fair.

697
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:46,992
Gregor was having an affair.

698
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,638
He couldn't chance getting caught. Not with
his tenth wedding anniversary approaching.

699
00:37:53,758 --> 00:37:58,208
He was desperate to get out of the
marriage without losing half of his company.

700
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:02,819
So he poisoned Ciaobella's
green superfood powder.

701
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:05,659
Only she wouldn't die...

702
00:38:06,052 --> 00:38:07,810
because she was bulimic.

703
00:38:08,013 --> 00:38:10,421
Ciaobella couldn't keep
anything she ate down.

704
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:14,052
That's why it took forever
for the poison to take effect.

705
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:16,234
All Gregor could do was wait...

706
00:38:16,848 --> 00:38:19,932
he wouldn't even let me drink
out of the same glass as her.

707
00:38:20,052 --> 00:38:22,010
And keep his vampire mistress away

708
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,803
from the poisonous elements.

709
00:38:26,332 --> 00:38:29,256
But Ciaobella knew of the affair,

710
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,029
and had herself a mind for murder.

711
00:38:32,149 --> 00:38:34,426
Using her own skills with electricity,

712
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,356
she laid a trap for Gregor

713
00:38:36,722 --> 00:38:39,626
before his plan was complete.

714
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:41,677
What's up?!

715
00:38:45,677 --> 00:38:47,238
What about Emily?

716
00:38:48,422 --> 00:38:51,345
Emily was drinking a superfood smoothie
the day she took over.

717
00:38:51,465 --> 00:38:52,599
Really, Jules?

718
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:54,927
- You too?
- I'm sorry.

719
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:58,394
Is this just a free-for-all? Anybody can
just bounce in anytime they want?

720
00:38:58,514 --> 00:39:00,093
I'm sorry.

721
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:04,036
In summation, Ciaobella killed Gregor.

722
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:06,218
Gregor killed Ciaobella.

723
00:39:06,338 --> 00:39:08,842
Emily got caught
in the green powdery crossfire.

724
00:39:08,962 --> 00:39:11,565
But not before she designed
the new fall line.

725
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:13,765
It's revolutionary, by the way.

726
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:16,229
We all deserve to feel beautiful.

727
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:19,379
What am I supposed to do with these?

728
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:21,532
Nothing. Put 'em away.

729
00:39:22,118 --> 00:39:23,811
I guess what I'm saying is...

730
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,868
you're all free to go.

731
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,120
That was crazy, right?

732
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,074
You could have told
me that over the phone.

733
00:39:35,194 --> 00:39:37,034
Hell, you could've put it in an email.

734
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:38,284
Come on.

735
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:41,499
Dude, did you see that?

736
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,324
That was, like,
the most stylish wrap-up ever.

737
00:39:44,344 --> 00:39:47,404
Except for the part where there was
no one to accuse. But whatever, right?

738
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:48,704
It was hot.

739
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:50,327
Gus.

740
00:39:50,886 --> 00:39:51,886
Gus?

741
00:39:56,915 --> 00:39:58,726
All right, here I am.

742
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:00,475
Why are you dressed like perry como?

743
00:40:00,595 --> 00:40:02,843
- Thanks for coming, son.
- You said it was important.

744
00:40:02,896 --> 00:40:05,530
Clearly, you're about to shoot
an old spice commercial.

745
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,900
That's funny.

746
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,409
Look, Shawn, I just... I need to
talk to you. You know, face to face.

747
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:13,808
I got it. You've been invited
to a very special screening of bullitt.

748
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:15,837
I'm going on another date with Susan.

749
00:40:17,383 --> 00:40:20,054
What, the woman you described
as a carnivorous mink?

750
00:40:20,174 --> 00:40:23,004
I'll admit her behavior threw me
a little off balance,

751
00:40:23,124 --> 00:40:26,341
but the night ended up
being a lot of fun.

752
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:28,609
Oh, my god.

753
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:30,426
You have a hickey!

754
00:40:30,546 --> 00:40:33,273
You called me over here
to show off your hickey?!

755
00:40:33,393 --> 00:40:34,948
- That's sick!
- Shawn, no!

756
00:40:35,729 --> 00:40:38,007
No, I called you over here because...

757
00:40:39,846 --> 00:40:42,217
I don't want to feel guilty
about moving on with my life.

758
00:40:42,278 --> 00:40:46,421
Your mother's not a part of it anymore. She hasn't
been for a long time. She is not coming back.

759
00:40:46,523 --> 00:40:48,788
And I hope she's happy.
Yeah... I mean that.

760
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:51,761
She deserves it.
But my life is here, Shawn.

761
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,377
And I don't want to have to
sneak around trying to live it.

762
00:40:54,397 --> 00:40:56,681
- I can't deal with this right now.
- Well, Shawn, you have to.

763
00:40:56,701 --> 00:40:59,552
Look, I don't care what you do, okay?
I don't care.

764
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:03,445
I just don't want to hear about it. So don't
call me on the phone asking me for advice.

765
00:41:03,565 --> 00:41:06,382
And don't expect me to meet you and your
new dominatrix girlfriend for dinner.

766
00:41:06,502 --> 00:41:09,496
- Kid, this is not easy for me either.
- Yeah, it never was.

767
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,285
Have a nice date.

768
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:22,779
And unless you plan on
taking her to wayne manor,

769
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:25,750
lose the turtleneck, okay?
Let her admire her work.

770
00:41:26,143 --> 00:41:29,418
And remember, you treat a woman
like a person, and then a princess,

771
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:32,415
- and then a greek goddess...
- And then a person again.

772
00:41:37,382 --> 00:41:38,382
Right.

773
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:42,936
Okay.
