1
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:10,750
- Shawn, this'll never work.
- I've done the math.

2
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:13,401
The ramp's too short.
You'll have to let me duck.

3
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:29,294
Shawn, stop!

4
00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:40,333
Crap.

5
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:48,438
What the hell do you think
you're doing, shawn?!

6
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,142
Dad, you ruined everything!

7
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:52,294
Of all the bone headed stunts
you've pulled in your life,

8
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:54,716
This is without a doubt the dumbest.

9
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:56,544
Shawn, what in the name
of everything that's holy

10
00:00:56,545 --> 00:00:59,903
Would possess you to do something
so incredibly stupid?

11
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,405
All the kids from my class
wanted to see me do it.

12
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:03,733
See?

13
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:07,006
No, see what, shawn?

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,693
Come here. Listen to me.

15
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:17,456
You think your fans came out
here to see you make this jump?

16
00:01:17,457 --> 00:01:21,214
They came out here to see you
crack your head open.

17
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:22,982
Which basically makes you
no different

18
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:25,618
Than the kid in class who can
shoot milk out of his eye.

19
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,152
Do you think i could be
as popular as him?

20
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:38,994
I can't believe
you did this, shawn.

21
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:41,243
Apparently you're unaware
that some churros

22
00:01:41,244 --> 00:01:42,909
Have more nutrients than carrots.

23
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,426
12 more of these, i'll have
my rda of ribo flavin.

24
00:01:46,427 --> 00:01:50,904
No, i mean accepting tickets to some
ridiculous tractor pull as payment for a case.

25
00:01:50,905 --> 00:01:52,831
Gus... excuse us.

26
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:54,787
When your clients
are carnie folk,

27
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:57,087
It's this or 20 rides
on a rusted tilt-A-Whirl.

28
00:01:57,088 --> 00:02:00,091
And i remember the last time
you got on one of those.

29
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:02,503
You know i had
early onset vertigo.

30
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:06,462
The important thing is that wolf boy and
his gold teeth have been reunited.

31
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:09,322
Don't play, shawn.

32
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:12,083
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give a huge

33
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:14,622
Santa barbara welcome
to our opening act.

34
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:17,342
Put your hands together
for the heart-Stopping,

35
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:24,778
Gravity-Mystifying, death-Defying
dutch "the clutch" jenkins!

36
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:38,917
I can't believe it, dude.
It's dutch the clutch.

37
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,569
What, you know that guy?

38
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,668
Dude, you don't remember
dutch the clutch?

39
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,864
He was on that's incredible
once when we were kids,

40
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,059
- And he jumped springfield gorge.
- That was homer simpson.

41
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,584
Dutch will attempt to launch himself
through the ring of fire

42
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:54,043
And land safely
on the other side.

43
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:57,305
But for the first time ever,
dutch will attempt

44
00:02:57,306 --> 00:03:01,494
This stunt
without the benefit of his sight!

45
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:06,432
- That guy is crazy.
- Crazy awesome.

46
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:12,828
Here we go, folks.
Hold on to your seats!

47
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,616
Everyone, please remain calm.

48
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:22,518
He's okay!

49
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,569
Everyone,
show your appreciation

50
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,792
For a true american hero,
dutch the clutch!

51
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:31,321
- That was insane.
- No.

52
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,357
That was attempted murder.

53
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:42,211
Psych 303
"daredevils!"

54
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:53,788
Synchro : flolo

55
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:59,421
For seriessub.Com

56
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:02,684
Dutch! Dutch the clutch.

57
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,640
- You honestly don't remember him?
- No.

58
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:06,445
Why is this such
a big deal for you?

59
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:09,784
Gus, guys like me and him are
cut from the same cloth, okay?

60
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:13,607
We cast aside the rules of society.
We laugh in the face of danger.

61
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:16,949
We ignore the tiny voice in our
head that tells us not to do stuff.

62
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,909
The tiny voice in my head says there's a
reason i'm the only black person here.

63
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,685
I'm telling you, man,
someone tried to kill him.

64
00:05:22,686 --> 00:05:24,633
Take it from a fellow motorcycle guy.

65
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:26,678
Please, what was the last repair
you did to your bike?

66
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:29,453
- Can you get that?
- Does adding a sticker count?

67
00:05:31,868 --> 00:05:33,577
Regardless.

68
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:36,439
Fuel lines
do not randomly spring leaks.

69
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,161
There's a killer out there.

70
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:40,644
And he or she failed,
so they're bound to try again.

71
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:42,525
How the hell are we
supposed to protect someone

72
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:44,089
Who straps himself
to a rocket-Powered bike

73
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,206
- And sails through a wall of fire?
- I'm working on it.

74
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:49,820
- Can i help you?
- Yes, i'm shawn spencer, police psychic,

75
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:52,978
Amateur daredevil, denture-Wearer,
and strawberry crepe enthusiast.

76
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,327
- You're not on the list.
- List?

77
00:05:55,328 --> 00:05:58,020
Dude, they're about to start racing
ocelots in half an hour.

78
00:05:58,021 --> 00:05:59,654
There's no way you have
a velvet rope here.

79
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:01,163
- Let's go, shawn.
- No, no, no.

80
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:04,449
I'm here to tell you that something
was off with dutch's last stunt.

81
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,552
He is in danger.
And i sense foul play.

82
00:06:07,553 --> 00:06:09,675
It's both a daredevil
and a psychic thing.

83
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:12,060
- You'll just have to trust me.
- Sir, i want you to turn around

84
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:13,587
And get the hell out of...

85
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:15,493
Give me a sec
with these guys, yeah?

86
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,027
I'm louis.

87
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:21,903
Dutch is my dad.

88
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:25,667
What the hell
do you mean by foul play?

89
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:28,915
- We're private investigators. He's a psychic.
- You left out the dardevil part.

90
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:30,922
And that's why he knows
the stunt was tampered with.

91
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,694
A psychic?

92
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:36,593
I don't know about that sort of thing,
but you might be on to something.

93
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:39,040
My dad's last two stunts
didn't go off right either.

94
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,728
And i have been noticing
some weird things lately.

95
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:44,824
Well, you're lucky.
We're in the business of weird.

96
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:47,622
What would you need for me to hire you?

97
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:50,161
- A retainer check for $2,000...
- Dutch's autograph.

98
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:52,930
- Man, i will punch you in the knee.
- Go ahead, i dare...

99
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:55,600
Looks, guys, money's
a little tight right now.

100
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:58,992
Last month we shared the bill
with yippy the hiccupping terrier.

101
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:00,128
He's still hiccupping?

102
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,400
Dude, you know that, but you don't know
who dutch the clutch is?

103
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,072
He's been hiccupping
for nine years.

104
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:06,046
- It's a canine record.
- Guys, please.

105
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:09,312
Look, no offense, but my dad's not
gonna let some psychic guy

106
00:07:09,313 --> 00:07:12,381
Hang around him.
His circle's air-Tight.

107
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:15,704
But we'll work something out.

108
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:18,880
Come on, there's an after party.
Let's go.

109
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:23,862
- Thank you, gertie.
- Thanks.

110
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:27,348
- You ready? Interrogation room "a."
- Great.

111
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:30,957
- So?
- So what?

112
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:34,045
Your date friday night. Details!
What happened?

113
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:36,647
Well, we ordered the crab cakes.

114
00:07:36,648 --> 00:07:40,952
And she went to the bathroom
and didn't come back.

115
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,972
So either it went badly,
or she's still in the bathroom.

116
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:46,659
Carlton, i'm sorry.

117
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,481
You told the dead clown story, didn't you?

118
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:55,811
- What? That is a funny story.
- Clowns are funny.

119
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:58,579
Stories about them being
shot to death, not so much.

120
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,266
Please tell me you didn't draw
a diagram of the bullet holes.

121
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:04,214
There were crayons on the table.
What was i supposed to do?

122
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:07,620
You took her to a restaurant
that had crayons on the table?

123
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,006
Thank you for your concern.

124
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:11,787
I am fine.

125
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:14,337
- Interrogation room "a," right?
- Yes.

126
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,389
What do i sound like?
An agent in the valley?

127
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,452
This is dutch the clutch.
What are you, deaf?

128
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:21,659
He doesn't get out of bed
for less than two grand.

129
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,647
3,500. 3,500, that's it.

130
00:08:25,624 --> 00:08:30,011
You know, the allman brothers
generally tend to inhibit my psychic power.

131
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:33,819
What just you tell me? Is there anyone
that'd like to see your dad bite the bullet?

132
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,966
Just about everybody
that comes to the show.

133
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:38,147
Anyone in here in particular
have a grudge with him?

134
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:39,433
- Against my dad?
- Yeah.

135
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:41,661
No way.  Everybody here loves him.

136
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:44,084
I can't understand why anyone
would want to hurt him.

137
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:46,852
In fact, i've been trying
to get him to retire altogether.

138
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:49,745
- Why doesn't he listen?
- Give up the spotlight?

139
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:52,456
Give up the applause, the love? Never.

140
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:56,273
Besides, well, my dad thinks
he's unkillable.

141
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:59,209
But he's wrong.
He's flesh and blood.

142
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,594
My flesh and blood. That's why
i'm counting on you boys.

143
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:05,005
Okay, let me... let me
introduce you to my dad.

144
00:09:05,006 --> 00:09:06,552
Do we have our cover stories yet?

145
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:09,245
Don't worry, i take care
of all the finances and hirings.

146
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:12,710
Pop, found us the two
new diehards you asked for.

147
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:14,969
- Damn, already?
- Actually, i'm die-Hard.

148
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,192
He's die-Harder. We have two
other guys in our crew,

149
00:09:17,193 --> 00:09:18,931
But they aren't nearly
as good as us.

150
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:20,823
Well, how the hell
you do that so quick?

151
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:22,950
Especially after what happened
to that last bunch?

152
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:24,678
Excuse me, what happened
to the last bunch?

153
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,681
We can't talk about it
for legal reasons.

154
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:29,713
All i know is our attorney said
that it ain't decapitation

155
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:31,496
If the head don't come off all the way.

156
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:36,476
I joke, i joke!

157
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:38,717
He better be.
That's morbid!

158
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:42,045
Hi, i'm viki, dutch's wife.

159
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,373
Now you boys have experience, right?

160
00:09:45,374 --> 00:09:47,589
It's up to you to keep my man safe.

161
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,071
That's right.

162
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,747
What's the most
dangerous thing you boys done?

163
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,945
We eat at taco john's
with some frequency,

164
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:57,724
So that puts us right there on the edge.

165
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,365
We got ourselves
a couple of comedians.

166
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,206
I like that!
Okay, you boys got the job...

167
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:06,188
- Damn!
- Did you just break your wrist?

168
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:09,444
Yeah, well, it's okay.
Nothing busted through the skin.

169
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:12,513
Dad, maybe you should take a break.
I mean, you almost got killed today.

170
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,666
Come on, son, you just worry
about your own safety. I'll be fine.

171
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,719
Maybe louis is right.

172
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:20,207
And we can finally take that vacation.

173
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:22,276
To dollywood!

174
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,462
Not to overstep, but i think you may
still have a concussion from earlier.

175
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:31,051
Concussion? Hell, i've had
a concussion since 1982.

176
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:34,630
True story. Anybody else's
beer taste like metal?

177
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:40,255
Sunday, don't miss el diablo.

178
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:42,497
Who the hell put that on there?

179
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:45,678
- Okay, did we miss something?
- Hell, that's el diablo.

180
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,388
What is an el diablo?

181
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:49,971
He's nobody.
Just some wannabe daredevil.

182
00:10:49,972 --> 00:10:52,056
No one knows who he is
because he always wears a mask.

183
00:10:52,057 --> 00:10:55,603
Right there! See that right there? That's
why we can't take no damn vacation.

184
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:58,347
- That son of a bitch is right on my heels.
- Relax, dad.

185
00:10:58,348 --> 00:11:00,903
He's amateur hour compared to you.

186
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:02,944
Forget about el diablo.

187
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:05,231
I got you that canyon jump
in september.

188
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,932
Rock on, manny!

189
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:11,373
I told you, clutch. Explosions, crashes.
That's what people pay to see.

190
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:13,421
You keep that up,
i'm gonna get you on tv.

191
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,346
And it won't be that infomercial
for the home stomach pump.

192
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:19,039
This is gonna be one of those
rain delay filler shows.

193
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,583
Dad, please. It's too soon to
be adding new stunts.

194
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:25,940
Bull piss, ain't nobody telling me
i can't do anything no more.

195
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:27,994
I think that was the worst
english i've ever heard.

196
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:29,162
All right!

197
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:31,716
$200 that i'm gonna take a fall!

198
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:33,701
- 300!
- 350!

199
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:36,087
- 400!
- 450!

200
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:37,639
550!

201
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:49,157
Glen campbell rocks!

202
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:53,107
Damn. I spilled my beer.

203
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:57,887
It might be harder to keep this
guy alive than i thought.

204
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:02,849
You need me, chief?

205
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,368
Why is someone lodging a complaint
against my head detective?

206
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:09,167
That's the third one this month.

207
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:12,011
He's just going through
a rough patch right now. He'll be fine.

208
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:15,077
I think he's having
some serious dating problems.

209
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:20,439
You know, when i used to work vice,
my partner was an alcoholic.

210
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,432
And one night i went
over to his house,

211
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:25,904
Handcuffed him to a radiator,
and made him dry out.

212
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:28,959
And when he finally sobered up,
i gave him a choice.

213
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:31,833
"Go into department rehab program

214
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,393
Or chew your hand off for freedom."
He chose the program.

215
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,684
Is that a real story?

216
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:42,715
Maybe it is, maybe i saw it
on an old police woman rerun.

217
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:46,431
The point is, o'hara, sometimes it's up
to the cop's partner

218
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,740
To keep their head above water?

219
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:53,610
To do what's necessary to make sure
that they stay on course. Get me?

220
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,166
Yes, chief.

221
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:01,492
This is for you.

222
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:03,753
What's wrong?

223
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:06,555
Chief just gave me some really weird advice.

224
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:10,413
- What does she want?
- I can't be sure, but...

225
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,899
I think she wants me
to find lassiter a girlfriend.

226
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:18,797
Good luck with that.

227
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,886
That makes sense. I guess.

228
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,608
Thanks, louis.

229
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:28,275
So dutch doesn't have a will
because apparently

230
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:30,353
Invincible people do not need them.

231
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:33,468
What is all this?

232
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:35,996
Those are forms that must be filled out
so that we can be diehards.

233
00:13:35,997 --> 00:13:37,157
Just sign them.

234
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:40,076
These "release the employer
from any liability

235
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:43,225
In case the stunt tester
is... torn to shreds?"

236
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:44,597
Stunt tester?

237
00:13:44,598 --> 00:13:46,509
Is that what we're doing?
Are you crazy?

238
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,252
Trust me, and be cool.

239
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:50,469
Wait, this one is in case
we're accidentally

240
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,684
Chewed to death
by a malfunctioning robot?

241
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:55,379
- Hell no!
- Relax, we'll be fine.

242
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,278
Deboned. Killed and re-Killed.
How does that even work?

243
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,939
Gus, don't be an old sponge
with hair hanging off it.

244
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,882
- I'm all over this case.
- "Mimed to death."

245
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:05,998
That's clearly a typo.
They meant "maimed."

246
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:07,408
What, are we gonna be killed
by marcel marceau?

247
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:10,749
- Marcel marceau is dead.
- See, there's nothing to worry about.

248
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,463
We are solving this case, shawn,
before we have to do any of this stuff.

249
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:17,152
Fair. I've been checking out
this el diablo guy.

250
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:20,012
He always rolls into town
the day after dutch.

251
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:22,692
And they've been competing
for the same gigs for almost a year.

252
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:25,936
Including that canyon jump
that dutch just got.

253
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:29,060
All right, motive. Wipe out dutch
and the field is clear.

254
00:14:29,394 --> 00:14:32,159
And el diablo is a daredevil,
so he would know

255
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,371
How to sabotage the stunts
to make it look like an accident.

256
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:35,867
I'll buy that.

257
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:37,824
And someone at the party told me
that el diablo performed

258
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:39,560
At the fair the night before dutch.

259
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:42,220
When dutch's team was no doubt
prepping for their stunt.

260
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:44,311
You're saying they had access
to dutch's equipment.

261
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:46,288
I'm sold. He's our guy.

262
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:49,157
So where is he?
Where do we find this el diablo?

263
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:53,192
How do you feel about checking out
some old antique motorcycles?

264
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:56,252
They call this a motorcycle show?

265
00:14:56,253 --> 00:14:58,049
There's, like, four motorcycles here.

266
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,044
They don't even have
the bike from blue thunder.

267
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:01,866
That was a helicopter.

268
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:04,581
You're right. I was thinking of blue lagoon.

269
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:07,653
- There wasn't a bike in blue lagoon.
- How'd they get off the island, gus?

270
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,298
Yo, el diablo! What's up, man?

271
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:16,775
Shawn spencer, this is my partner,
squirts macintosh.

272
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:19,473
Just have a couple sort of
serious questions for you.

273
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:21,650
No, no, no, you don't
have to get on the bike.

274
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:28,700
Dude, he's running. International
sign of guilt. Let's go, quick.

275
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,781
Get in the side car.

276
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:35,601
Are you out of your damn mind?
I'm not getting in that thing. You get in there.

277
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:39,150
You have absolutely no idea how to
drive a motorcycle. Get in the side car.

278
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:45,609
- Dude, it's like high road to china.
- What are you doing?

279
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,311
We're going, we're going.

280
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,831
Louis?

281
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,481
You're el diablo?

282
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:21,085
That is the sexiest thing
i've ever seen.

283
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:22,780
Shut up, shawn.

284
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:25,125
You're guilty of attempted patricide.

285
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:27,935
And you tried to kill your own dad.

286
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:29,828
I never tried to kill anyone.

287
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:33,041
You really think i'd hire detectives
if i wanted to bump off my own dad?

288
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:34,645
What kind of psychic are you?

289
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:37,627
The kind that loves bees
and historical novels.

290
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:39,490
The kind that knows a lie
when he hears one.

291
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,693
And knows that only
the guilty make a run for it.

292
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:45,839
The only thing i am guilty of is not
telling my dad that i do this too.

293
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,704
And i ran because i don't want
you two exposing my secret.

294
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:50,522
- Why hide it?
- My dad

295
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:54,103
Forbid me from being a daredevil
because he didn't want me to get hurt.

296
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:57,942
Do you know what it's like to have your
father tell you notto follow in his footsteps?

297
00:17:58,627 --> 00:17:59,982
I wish.

298
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:02,577
I did this because i care about my dad.

299
00:18:02,721 --> 00:18:06,917
As soon as el diablo starts making some noise
and he knows i'm legit, then i'll tell him.

300
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:10,906
Then maybe he'll let me take over the
family business and finally retire.

301
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:13,185
Hopefully before he gets really hurt.

302
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,835
Psychic vision incoming!

303
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:23,188
I see colors on your hands,
on your bike. On your hands.

304
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:26,238
My daughter, my sister,
my father the hero.

305
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:28,875
Yeah, i repainted my bike recently.

306
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:31,008
- I had paint on my hands.
- Repainted why?

307
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:34,038
- Because you stole it from your dad?
- I borrowed it.

308
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,835
Dad was supposed to use this
in the last jump.

309
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:39,201
But manny got us a sponsor
and a new bike.

310
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,656
Tech specs said
the new bike was way safer.

311
00:18:41,657 --> 00:18:44,159
- Left this one for me.
- Who the hell is manny?

312
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,357
The agent.

313
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,539
Look, you guys aren't gonna
tell him who i am, right?

314
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,239
It's a sensitive subject.
He won't understand it right away.

315
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,561
I just want him to come to grips with...

316
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,787
This is what i am.

317
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,838
I didn't choose it.

318
00:19:00,143 --> 00:19:01,501
Yeah.

319
00:19:02,243 --> 00:19:05,810
I had a similar experience
with my dad when i told him i...

320
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:08,375
Wanted to take gus here to the prom.

321
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:14,019
Come on, you and me at the prom?

322
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,780
No?
Misfire?

323
00:19:18,226 --> 00:19:22,171
So the exploding motorcycle
was provided at the last minute

324
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:23,674
By dutch's agent manny.

325
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:26,591
Who probably slapped those
sponsor decals on himself.

326
00:19:26,592 --> 00:19:28,517
I'd say that warrant investigation.

327
00:19:28,518 --> 00:19:31,623
Doesn't make sense. Why would an agent
risk his client's life?

328
00:19:31,624 --> 00:19:34,488
- Isn't that his money train?
- Remember the after party?

329
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:38,616
I told you, clutch, explosions, crashes.
That's what people pay to see.

330
00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:41,410
Manny may not be trying
to kill dutch...

331
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:45,107
But he's making the stunts more dangerous
to add a little pizzazz to dutch's act.

332
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:47,259
Which in turn gets dutch more gigs.

333
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,188
Which in turn is only
increasing manny's 10%.

334
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,861
Which in turn makes me wonder
why you would use the word pizzazz.

335
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,521
What are you doing?

336
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:05,039
I'll give you an a-Plus
for the skulking,

337
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,389
But a c-Minus for the leering.

338
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,686
I have to find lassiter
a date for the weekend.

339
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:11,922
I've narrowed it down to three
prospective candidates.

340
00:20:11,923 --> 00:20:14,690
Jules, why would you possibly want
to jump into that snake pit?

341
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:17,116
- Vick ordered me to.
- All right.

342
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:19,606
Would you like me to give
your candidates the psychic once over?

343
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:21,548
If you have to.

344
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:24,139
I'm sensing it'll be easier
to get a stranger

345
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,621
To go out with him
than someone he works with.

346
00:20:25,622 --> 00:20:27,533
- Or knows him.
- Or has ever had a conversation with him.

347
00:20:27,534 --> 00:20:29,020
- Or he hasn't shot.
- One more question.

348
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,722
Are we locked into the same species?

349
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:32,934
Enough already.
What are you guys doing here?

350
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:35,048
We need a background check
on manny robertson.

351
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:36,667
I know that name.

352
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,570
Yeah, we've had him in here a few times
on some get-Rich-Quick scams.

353
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:40,895
Why him?

354
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:45,040
I'm getting a very strong vibe
off him on this awesome daredevils

355
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:49,045
- Case we're working.
- Daredevils, really? They're still around?

356
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:52,093
Don't... don't do that.
Don't hate on the devils.

357
00:20:52,094 --> 00:20:54,717
I just... i never got it personally.

358
00:20:54,718 --> 00:20:57,642
I mean, "i can jump
over a flaming trashcan."

359
00:20:57,643 --> 00:21:00,426
- I mean, why do people care?
- Allow me.

360
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:08,101
- What is he doing?
- Wait for it.

361
00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:14,740
Wait for it.

362
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:19,319
What's up?

363
00:21:48,383 --> 00:21:50,610
I'm okay, i'm okay, i'm okay.

364
00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:52,804
- Need any more proof?
- No, i got it.

365
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:55,314
I'm fine.

366
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,556
We need to find manny
as soon as possible.

367
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:01,934
We should have a little
breathing room, actually.

368
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:04,916
If manny's our mad saboteur, he won't
strike until he has an audience.

369
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:06,876
During the actual stunt,
not during rehearsal.

370
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:07,884
Exactly.

371
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,260
Next stunt's tomorrow.

372
00:22:13,261 --> 00:22:15,550
A jump, closing night of the fair.

373
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:17,572
Dutch should be safe till then.

374
00:22:17,573 --> 00:22:18,636
Clutch!

375
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:26,376
Or not.

376
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:31,802
Holy.

377
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,696
Are you all right?

378
00:22:34,412 --> 00:22:37,527
Are you all right? Should we
call the cops or the ambulance?

379
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:40,061
What the hell for? I've done that
stunt a thousand times.

380
00:22:40,062 --> 00:22:41,876
That was just a rehearsal.

381
00:22:43,442 --> 00:22:45,205
Now it's your turn.

382
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:47,706
Come on, i got you set up
over at the stadium.

383
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:54,485
You know, dutch,
seeing as how gus and i

384
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:58,042
Are just getting started, a couple
questions about representation.

385
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,238
Namely, your agent manny.

386
00:23:00,892 --> 00:23:04,268
First we rehearse. Then i gotta strip viki down
and oil her joints.

387
00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:07,035
Not too shy
about your wife, are you?

388
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:09,701
I'm talking about my bikes.
I name 'em all after my wife.

389
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:12,257
Maybe we could just talk
to manny himself.

390
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,555
- Where abouts is he?
- I'll call him later.

391
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:16,742
After i give viki
a lube job and pull her nuts.

392
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:19,913
Guys, come on! We gotta get ready
for that catapult stunt!

393
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:22,682
You boys ready to work?

394
00:23:22,683 --> 00:23:24,704
Strip and put these on.

395
00:23:28,606 --> 00:23:30,793
All right, this one's easy.

396
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:33,729
All you gotta do is stand here.

397
00:23:33,963 --> 00:23:37,255
How the hell are we supposed to help
dutch when we're stuck doing this stuff?

398
00:23:37,256 --> 00:23:39,605
As long as we're making sure the stunts
are safe, he can't get killed.

399
00:23:39,606 --> 00:23:41,983
- I'll make it safe for me outside.
- You need to man up.

400
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:44,274
- I'd put these masks on if i was you.
- What for?

401
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:46,694
What is this, an under water
stunt or something?

402
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:48,757
Wait, is that gasoline?

403
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:55,277
You must be out of your damn mind!

404
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:57,365
We had to see how fire
retardant these suits were.

405
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:59,300
You didn't know that before you tried
to set us on fire?

406
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:01,174
What do you think
you're getting paid for?

407
00:24:03,953 --> 00:24:05,607
Great news, baby.

408
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:08,206
Apparently some crazy fan
ran el diablo off the road

409
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:10,272
At the classic bike show
and he injured his shoulder.

410
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:13,416
He can't do the clock tower death
drop stunt and i got it for you.

411
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:15,278
Rock on, manny!

412
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,433
All right, we're gonna have to rig these
two up and drop 'em off the building first.

413
00:24:18,434 --> 00:24:20,609
- No, no, no time to rehearse.
- Thank you, lord.

414
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,574
The time of the event
was already advertised.

415
00:24:22,575 --> 00:24:24,699
If we want it, we gotta do it now.
You up for it, dutch?

416
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,995
What, are you kidding?

417
00:24:25,996 --> 00:24:29,820
Hell, one time i bungee jumped off
a building twice as high as that tower.

418
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:32,758
And even though the bungee cord snapped
on the way down, i still made it

419
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:35,925
To the george thorogood
concert that night. True story.

420
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:37,907
Yes, sir!

421
00:24:37,908 --> 00:24:40,532
We're gonna make some money, dutch.

422
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:44,081
No rehearsal? That's convenient.

423
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,445
Manny's rushing dutch
into another stunt unprepared.

424
00:24:46,446 --> 00:24:48,167
Another stunt.

425
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:50,266
Another chance for sabotage.

426
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,633
What is going on?

427
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:56,011
Apparently dutch is going
to jump from the building,

428
00:24:56,012 --> 00:24:59,349
Spread his arms, and glide down
to that large pillow

429
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,669
All live on camera
for some daredevil web site.

430
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:05,279
Red!

431
00:25:09,805 --> 00:25:12,166
- You see that?
- Yes.

432
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:14,333
Now i'm in the mood for some coffee.

433
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:16,052
What are you talking about?

434
00:25:16,053 --> 00:25:17,910
Coffee, shawn.

435
00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:20,214
- What are you looking at?
- The same thing you're looking at.

436
00:25:20,215 --> 00:25:23,089
- It's a dunkin' donuts patch, gus.
- And they have excellent coffee.

437
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,948
They have one on my extended route.

438
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,094
You know what, dude?
You astound me.

439
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:30,181
And now i must have a blueberry crumb.

440
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:32,142
It's totally triggered
my donut launch sequence.

441
00:25:32,143 --> 00:25:33,851
- Will you focus, shawn?
- I can't.

442
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,087
No, don't jump!

443
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,127
What the hell's wrong with you?

444
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:08,116
- Everything's wrecked now.
- Are you all right, baby?

445
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:11,175
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

446
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:18,041
You could've killed
my husband, you idiot!

447
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,477
- Got you.
- Idiot?

448
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,929
How about mind-Blowing genius?

449
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:25,929
Dutch, please.

450
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,253
Spread your arms the way you would
in the middle of the stunt.

451
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,017
I don't take orders
from nimrods like you.

452
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:34,287
Dutch... do it.

453
00:26:34,437 --> 00:26:35,871
Do it!

454
00:26:48,094 --> 00:26:50,296
If you would've jumped,
you would've died.

455
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:54,653
So that you tried to pull out there?

456
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,178
Nobody steals my spotlight, nobody!

457
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,216
You're just damn lucky
manny pulled me off that roof

458
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,361
Before i got a chance
to throw you off it!

459
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:03,142
Dutch, i'm gonna level with you.

460
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:04,904
We're not really professional stuntmen.

461
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:07,136
Now that would explain
all the screaming.

462
00:27:07,137 --> 00:27:08,974
So what the hell's going on?

463
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:12,549
- We're...
- Animal activists.

464
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,450
- Right.
- And that is the truth.

465
00:27:14,451 --> 00:27:16,674
We are here to stop you
from abusing any more

466
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:20,982
Large... impressive exotic game
in your act.

467
00:27:20,983 --> 00:27:24,982
- Shame on you, dutch the clutch.
- I ain't got no animals in my act!

468
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:29,473
Well, that settles that.
Gus and i will be going.

469
00:27:29,474 --> 00:27:30,814
Sit down!

470
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,185
Now the next thing that comes out of
your mouth better be the truth.

471
00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:36,852
Otherwise we're gonna start rehearsing
that bury you alive stunt.

472
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:39,877
We're detectives. He's a psychic.
We were hired by your son.

473
00:27:39,878 --> 00:27:42,524
- Dad, i can explain.
- I'm a christian man!

474
00:27:42,525 --> 00:27:44,147
What the hell are you
trying to do getting me

475
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:46,759
All mixed up
in that voodoo dark force stuff?

476
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,263
We think that someone is trying
to sabotage your stunts.

477
00:27:50,264 --> 00:27:52,892
Let's just hear 'em out.
Have you guys found anything?

478
00:27:52,893 --> 00:27:58,364
- Yes, we think that it's...
- We're not sure who it is yet exactly.

479
00:27:58,365 --> 00:28:01,239
That's because nobody's
trying to kill me. News flash.

480
00:28:01,308 --> 00:28:04,227
Almost dying's par for the course
for my line of work.

481
00:28:04,228 --> 00:28:07,572
Dutch, someone tampered
with that gliding suit.

482
00:28:07,573 --> 00:28:09,320
The spirits are sure of it.

483
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:12,168
That gliding suit tore
because i bought it

484
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:14,986
During the gliding suit boom in 1977.

485
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:17,009
And that fall
wouldn't have killed me!

486
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,684
Damn, one time i jumped out a blimp
500 feet in the sky.

487
00:28:19,685 --> 00:28:21,444
Had a heart attack on the way down.

488
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:26,095
Two hours later, i was eating a blt
in a red robin. True story!

489
00:28:27,987 --> 00:28:30,091
Dutch, please listen to us.

490
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:33,760
No, you listen to me, because i'm
only gonna say it one time. You're fired!

491
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:37,637
- Red, help these boys out.
- Wait a second...

492
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:45,361
So we're not gonna shoot gus
out of a cannon later?

493
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:47,259
No? Okay, okay.

494
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:05,617
There's something i love
about these low-Rent stakeouts.

495
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,939
All you gotta do is snap some pictures
of a guy with some stolen merchandise.

496
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:11,688
Why didn't you wear
the burgundy turtleneck?

497
00:29:11,689 --> 00:29:14,868
Because it didn't occur to me
to change for a stakeout. Why?

498
00:29:14,947 --> 00:29:19,453
No reason. I just... i really like you
in that burgundy turtleneck.

499
00:29:19,454 --> 00:29:21,131
And with short hair.

500
00:29:21,132 --> 00:29:23,740
And you know what else?
A little cologne wouldn't kill you.

501
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:25,799
All right, you think i don't
know what's going on here.

502
00:29:26,051 --> 00:29:28,278
Look, i've noticed
you're kind of...

503
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,261
Checking me out at the squad
and asking about my dating habits.

504
00:29:32,262 --> 00:29:35,094
- It's not a big deal. It's just...
- Listen,

505
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:39,625
It is perfectly normal for a
junior officer to develop...

506
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:44,438
Feelings for her superior. Someone
she feels is a mentor and...

507
00:29:47,094 --> 00:29:50,031
- My god, no.
- O'hara, it's okay.

508
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:53,640
No, no, vick ordered me
to find you a girlfriend.

509
00:29:54,263 --> 00:29:56,053
- What?
- Yeah.

510
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:59,153
You know, we've noticed
that you've been on edge lately,

511
00:29:59,154 --> 00:30:01,168
And thought it might help.

512
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:03,795
And i have this friend
you can meet later who likes cops.

513
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:05,315
I don't believe this.

514
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:08,760
That's a total invasion of my privacy.

515
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:11,107
Not to mention unprofessional.

516
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,212
So what? I sleep alone.

517
00:30:14,641 --> 00:30:18,896
So what if i saw a frozen dinner in half
before i microwave it every night?

518
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:22,209
So what if i seriously considered planting
evidence on my wife's new boyfriend?

519
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,846
I mean, that's...
i could... just...

520
00:30:26,361 --> 00:30:29,790
- Oh my god, i may need your help.
- That's all i want to do.

521
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:32,585
Damn, i'm not getting a signal.

522
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:34,332
All right, i'm gonna
go find a hot spot.

523
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,710
And then when i get back,
i'll tell you all about my friend.

524
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,241
Why didn't you tell them about manny?

525
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:42,475
Because it's not him. When
manny was adjusting dutch's suit

526
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:45,492
Before the stunt, he whispered
something in his ear.

527
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:48,406
I, of course, read his lips.

528
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,489
He said he didn't want him
wearing that gliding suit.

529
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,960
He wanted him to wear the black one
because it was far more slimming.

530
00:30:54,961 --> 00:30:56,801
And then he said...

531
00:30:57,143 --> 00:30:59,084
"Purple camel lawnmower man."

532
00:30:59,368 --> 00:31:02,340
How the hell are we supposed to help
dutch now that we've been banished?

533
00:31:03,985 --> 00:31:06,486
I'm gonna go over there
and start working on it.

534
00:31:06,877 --> 00:31:08,995
You're wasting energy, shawn.

535
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,703
Do you see solar panels up in here?

536
00:31:14,564 --> 00:31:17,503
Come on now, you guys gotta hurry.
Next stunt is coming up fast.

537
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,857
Dad'll kill me if he finds out
i let you back in here.

538
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:22,638
Don't worry, louis. We'll be as nonexistent
as an aldo nova fan.

539
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,891
So what are we looking for?

540
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:31,238
Red.

541
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:34,596
When he gave us the heave-Ho,
i saw an old tattoo on his arm.

542
00:31:34,597 --> 00:31:38,691
First four letters spelled "viki,"
but in a slightly different font from the rest.

543
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,870
So?

544
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:43,398
So he was probably seeing her
before she married dutch, right?

545
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:47,085
She leaves him. He gets a
different tattoo artist to add the "n-G-S"

546
00:31:47,086 --> 00:31:49,012
To conceal it from his boss.

547
00:31:49,013 --> 00:31:51,151
Maybe red's trying
to eliminate the competion.

548
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:52,340
Bingo.

549
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,721
Let me go first.

550
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,881
- I'm more stealthy.
- In your dreams.

551
00:32:13,882 --> 00:32:16,012
I'm as graceful as a gazelle, shawn.

552
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:17,508
- You are not.
- A jackal.

553
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:20,488
Dude, a jackal is not graceful.

554
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:22,976
It's like a rabid, vicious badger.

555
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,102
Now what is that?

556
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,395
This is it.

557
00:32:38,396 --> 00:32:41,734
I bet you that's a bomb, and he's
gonna put it on one of the bikes.

558
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,034
Come on, red.

559
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:01,078
Let's get this over with.

560
00:33:02,352 --> 00:33:04,374
What the heck?

561
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:10,786
Dude, why would someone take...

562
00:33:10,787 --> 00:33:13,606
"Gemacetabine" or "capsitonabine?"

563
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:16,454
You were nowhere close
on the pronunciation.

564
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:17,895
- What are they for?
- Those two together?

565
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,836
You probably got pancreatic cancer.

566
00:33:19,837 --> 00:33:22,378
- Prognosis?
- Not good. It's pretty terminal.

567
00:33:23,588 --> 00:33:25,492
He's dying.

568
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,206
So red is not a bad guy you wouldn't smalling drugs
to help dutch and then turn around and kill him.

569
00:33:33,207 --> 00:33:35,849
This case is bizarre. Why kill someone
if he's already dying?

570
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,284
That begs the question,
who knows he's dying?

571
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:40,408
We don't come up with something
soon, he's a goner.

572
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:42,422
We need to know who stands
to gain from dutch's death.

573
00:33:42,423 --> 00:33:45,193
- And for that, we need his will.
- But louis said there was no will.

574
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:47,943
He doesn't know his dad's dying, gus.

575
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:50,085
If you were dying of cancer,
wouldn't you have a will?

576
00:33:50,086 --> 00:33:52,669
Are you kidding? I've had my
estate planner on speed dial

577
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,232
Ever since we started
this stupid business.

578
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:57,289
Do you know how many times i've had a
gun shoved in my face because of you?

579
00:33:57,557 --> 00:33:58,787
Three?

580
00:33:59,129 --> 00:34:00,769
Wrong answer.

581
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,539
We're never gonna find it.

582
00:34:15,008 --> 00:34:16,703
Wait a minute.

583
00:34:17,243 --> 00:34:19,772
There's something weird
with this tile.

584
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:21,957
- Looks fine to me.
- No, no, no.

585
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:23,966
The pattern's off.
Just a little bit.

586
00:34:24,007 --> 00:34:27,162
Like someone pried one up
and put it down wrong.

587
00:34:32,459 --> 00:34:35,107
- Bingo.
- Is that his will?

588
00:34:39,646 --> 00:34:41,353
It's just as good.

589
00:34:41,354 --> 00:34:44,027
- Life insurance policy.
- That doesn't make any sense.

590
00:34:44,028 --> 00:34:45,900
Tell me about it.

591
00:34:47,143 --> 00:34:50,505
Dude, seriously, tell me about it.
I have no idea what this means.

592
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:53,315
- You never could understand legalese.
- Really?

593
00:34:53,316 --> 00:34:55,463
Remind me who it was
that set up our psych 401k?

594
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:59,276
You mean our 601ks?
Because india doesn't have 401ks.

595
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:01,093
It's a growth economy.

596
00:35:01,094 --> 00:35:03,972
- We've already made, like, 500 rupee.
- That's $13.

597
00:35:03,973 --> 00:35:06,342
Man, just tell me
what i need to know.

598
00:35:06,343 --> 00:35:09,142
Do i rush you when you're doing
you whole, "i'm sensing

599
00:35:09,143 --> 00:35:11,174
- This, i'm sensing that?"
- Always.

600
00:35:11,185 --> 00:35:13,733
And you usually jab me in the ribs
with your elbow.

601
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,911
Which is like a chocolate harpoon.

602
00:35:15,912 --> 00:35:17,538
- Are you finished?
- Maybe.

603
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:21,698
On first read, it says if dutch dies of
natural causes, there's barely a payout.

604
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:24,199
That doesn't make any sense for someone
who's always putting himself at risk.

605
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,932
But dutch has a unique
indemnity policy.

606
00:35:26,963 --> 00:35:31,442
If he dies during one of his stunts,
his beneficiaries receive $1.2 million.

607
00:35:31,989 --> 00:35:33,604
Who are the beneficiaries?

608
00:35:34,627 --> 00:35:36,567
His wife and his son.

609
00:35:39,977 --> 00:35:42,419
I know who our killer is.

610
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:48,012
And it is a packed house here
for tonight's main event,

611
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:52,795
The legendary dutch "the clutch" jenkins
and his most dangerous stunt ever.

612
00:35:52,796 --> 00:35:56,248
We are moments away from showtime,
ladies and gentlemen...

613
00:35:56,249 --> 00:35:59,254
What the hellnare you doing here?
I thought i fired your ass.

614
00:36:01,138 --> 00:36:03,926
I just came to apologize to you, dutch.

615
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:05,347
For what?

616
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:08,203
I was wrong about you.

617
00:36:08,926 --> 00:36:12,698
All this time, i thought you were
the kid who shot milk out of his eye.

618
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:15,583
You know, willing to do just
about anything for attention,

619
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:17,653
Regardless of how it effects
the people around you.

620
00:36:17,654 --> 00:36:20,018
But that's... that's
not the case, is it?

621
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:23,270
Son, i'm getting tired
of the sound of your gums flapping.

622
00:36:23,271 --> 00:36:27,146
You're all about family,
aren't you, dutch?

623
00:36:27,147 --> 00:36:29,222
You love 'em more than life.

624
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,749
That's why you've been
trying to kill yourself.

625
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:40,784
I sensed a dark cloud over you.

626
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:43,847
You're terminally ill.

627
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:46,933
I'm sorry, man.

628
00:36:47,467 --> 00:36:50,083
It must be so scary knowing
that you're gonna die,

629
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:52,860
Especially when you're
all that your family has.

630
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:58,512
And that's why you took out
that special insurance policy.

631
00:36:59,435 --> 00:37:03,028
The one that only you know about.

632
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:06,565
Now all you gotta do
is make sure that you die

633
00:37:06,566 --> 00:37:10,403
In the middle of a stunt,
and your family gets a windfall.

634
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:11,851
Right?

635
00:37:11,894 --> 00:37:15,010
It should've been a simple matter
of you sabotaging your own stunts,

636
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:18,302
But, dutch, you're a victim
of your own talent.

637
00:37:18,462 --> 00:37:22,042
You actually are
a little unkillable.

638
00:37:22,043 --> 00:37:26,274
Even with all your faulty mechanics,
your instincts kicked in

639
00:37:26,275 --> 00:37:28,733
And prevented you from failing.

640
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:30,512
It's almost showtime, folks.

641
00:37:30,513 --> 00:37:32,831
Dutch "the clutch" jenkins
is here to perform

642
00:37:32,832 --> 00:37:35,223
A gravity defying spectacle.

643
00:37:35,224 --> 00:37:38,914
Look, i know this is your last stunt
for awhile, and that's my fault.

644
00:37:40,103 --> 00:37:43,273
If this disease gets you before your next
show, your family gets nothing.

645
00:37:43,274 --> 00:37:47,182
So i'm sure whatever
your method is tonight,it's fool proof.

646
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:51,077
What are you gonna do now?

647
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:56,098
Nothing. I'm not gonna try and stop you.

648
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:59,415
And i will not say anything
if you go through with it.

649
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,988
You have my word.

650
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:24,384
Just let me leave you with this, dutch.

651
00:38:26,481 --> 00:38:30,731
It doesn't take a psychic
to see how much people love you.

652
00:38:30,732 --> 00:38:33,110
Your son came to me
and hired a psychic

653
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,030
Against his better judgment
to keep you alive.

654
00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:38,347
And you don't know this yet,
but all he wants in the world

655
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:40,084
Is to be more like you.

656
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,491
You go to your son, or your wife,

657
00:38:43,492 --> 00:38:46,825
Or anyone on your crew
for that matter, and you ask them

658
00:38:46,919 --> 00:38:48,976
Which they'd rather have:

659
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:53,807
Six more months with you
or a million dollars.

660
00:38:55,616 --> 00:38:57,927
You know damn well
what they'll answer,

661
00:38:57,928 --> 00:39:00,167
And they won't have to think
about it for a second.

662
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:09,328
Is that right?

663
00:39:11,713 --> 00:39:13,244
True story.

664
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:16,575
You're wrong.

665
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,260
I was that kid in class
who shot milk out of his eyes.

666
00:39:28,105 --> 00:39:30,114
And i was damn good.

667
00:39:41,152 --> 00:39:47,278
And here he is now,
dutch "the clutch" jenkins!

668
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,014
And he's off.

669
00:40:02,015 --> 00:40:05,292
Speeding down the ramp.
He's past the point of no return.

670
00:40:05,293 --> 00:40:07,408
It's all or nothing.

671
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:13,889
He did it! He did it!

672
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,654
A hundred wagons.

673
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:18,480
Give it up. Fantastic.
A victory lap around the arena.

674
00:40:18,481 --> 00:40:22,182
What a night. You've witnessed history
here tonight, folks.

675
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:24,594
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it...

676
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:32,262
No, really? You grew up
your whole life in santa barbara?

677
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,005
Yeah. Very much.

678
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:37,876
I cannot believe that!
That's amazing.

679
00:40:37,877 --> 00:40:39,943
- That's fascinating...
- What are you doing?

680
00:40:39,944 --> 00:40:42,472
I'm just talking
to your friend blair here.

681
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,028
She... she's great.

682
00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:46,673
- We have so much in common.
- She's not my friend.

683
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:48,867
What do you mean? You didn't send her
down here to meet me?

684
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:52,397
No! I don't invite friends
to dangerous stakeouts.

685
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:54,994
But i know her. She's a professional.

686
00:40:57,952 --> 00:41:00,152
Please tell me you're a hit man.

687
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:04,650
So are we gonna do this or not?

688
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,780
I gotta go.

689
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,789
So i guess we're not on
for saturday?

690
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:20,729
