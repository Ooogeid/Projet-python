1
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:15,551
Well, this is it.

2
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:16,876
I guess it is.

3
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:21,145
Stay in California with me.

4
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,320
Scott, no, we talked about this.

5
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:31,307
I have two years left of college,

6
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,157
the police academy in Miami,

7
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:34,658
and you know...

8
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,805
long-distance relationships,
they never work.

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,831
And Florida and California,
I mean, we couldn't be further apart.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,348
Yeah, I know,
but this trip out here together,

11
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:47,683
it's made me want to throw
caution to the wind, you know?

12
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:50,091
- And you... You like California, right?
- I do.

13
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,570
It's nice, and...

14
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:55,638
Maybe someday, but I don't know,

15
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,432
the idea of a clean break,
it just makes so much sense.

16
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:00,726
I know.

17
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:04,685
I have an idea.

18
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:08,374
How about in ten years,

19
00:01:08,814 --> 00:01:10,986
we meet right back here,
same time, 4:00.

20
00:01:12,063 --> 00:01:15,362
And if we're both married, great.
We'll talk about our kids,

21
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:19,138
but if we're both single,
we'll go for coffee,

22
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:21,152
see where it goes.

23
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,209
Both practical and hugely romantic.
How do you always do that?

24
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:33,634
All right.

25
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:49,734
There's only one problem.

26
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:51,402
Ten years is too long.

27
00:01:52,374 --> 00:01:54,321
- How about eight?
- How about seven?

28
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:56,782
See you then.

29
00:02:03,436 --> 00:02:05,040


30
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:21,294
I should just leave, right?

31
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:26,189
No, a couple minutes. I'll stay.

32
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:28,964
No, you're right.
You are absolutely right.

33
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,401
I really do appreciate
you being my sounding board

34
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:07,026
through all of this.

35
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,040
I want you to listen to me, O'Hara.

36
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:13,752
And believe this, because I mean it
from the bottom of my heart.

37
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:17,522
All romance ends in despair...

38
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:20,558
Or death, but mostly despair.

39
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,585
Gut-wrenching despair.

40
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,057
I hate to say this,
but I'm happy that this happened,

41
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:30,394
because now you know,
and it's gonna make you a better cop

42
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:34,053
to realize that all people
are essentially just out there

43
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,401
to destroy any chance of happiness
you would ever have.

44
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:40,613
I feel a hug coming on.

45
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:46,911
Okay, there you go.

46
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:50,873
You know what? You're right.

47
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:53,208
I am not going to sit here

48
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,040
and wonder why he didn't show up.

49
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:57,296
I barely remembered the date.
How could he?

50
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,091
I am gonna get back to work.
I have important things to do.

51
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,888


52
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,155


53
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:37,753
So your friend appears to have
fallen off the face of the earth?

54
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,389
I haven't digging anything yet,

55
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:43,140
so I need you to look through
every single file that I've tagged here.

56
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:45,418
We have a missing persons case...

57
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,945
Something I should know about?

58
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,019
It's a...

59
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,478
A personal matter?

60
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:58,066
First of all, I'm sure you know

61
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,568
the use of these files for anything
other than police business is illegal,

62
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:05,781
and you have a serious
backlog of real cases.

63
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:09,145
I know. I'm...
I just lost my head for a second.

64
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,370
- I'm sorry.
- I don't mean to sound like a hard-ass.

65
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,163
- No. I didn't get that.
- I did.

66
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,166
- I was trying to sound like a hard-ass.
- Mission accomplished.

67
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:19,284
Go back to work, O'Hara.

68
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:25,631
I'm sorry
your boyfriend didn't show.

69
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:28,512
Can I offer you a piece
of general advice about men?

70
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:31,895
They often don't show.

71
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,715
Scott was different.

72
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:52,994
- You want us to find someone for you?
- No, not us.

73
00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:55,039
- You.
- Why not Shawn?

74
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:58,198
It's a tricky situation.
See, it's somebody that I used to know.

75
00:06:58,323 --> 00:07:00,919
A boyfriend...
Well, a former boyfriend,

76
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,300
but seeing everything that's happened,
it would be like opening a wound...

77
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:07,159
- You know what I mean.
- I will handle this in stealth mode.

78
00:07:07,284 --> 00:07:10,095
You might not know this,
but I'm known as "the vault of secrets".

79
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:13,849
- No, I didn't know that.
- Shawn will never find out.

80
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:32,927
- What are you doing?
- Working on a case for Juliet,

81
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,666
a random missing persons case.
She doesn't want me to bother you.

82
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,915
What? Jules needs help, I'm in.
You know that.

83
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,151
But no... She said no...
Well, said no.

84
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,876
I'd rather do it solo.

85
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,409
Oh, my God.

86
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,982
Are you in the vault of secrets
right now?

87
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:48,772
You are.

88
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:51,385
- It's settled. I'm helping.
- You are not helping. Period. Suck it.

89
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,222
Fine.

90
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:56,861
I guess I'll just find Scott Seaver
by myself, solo.

91
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:59,359
You don't know how to do it solo.
That's my department.

92
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:01,734
- Sounds like a challenge.
- It's not a challenge.

93
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:04,225
- Challenge accepted.
- Will you get out of here?

94
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,068


95
00:08:07,597 --> 00:08:09,911
- What are you doing here?
- I have a meeting with... someone.

96
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:11,607
- And you?
- I solved Juliet's case.

97
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:13,074
- You did not.
- Yes, I did.

98
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,362
- Let me be the one to break it to her.
- Absolutely not.

99
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:17,552
- She hired me.
- Gus, it was a tricky find.

100
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:19,562
I want all the glory
for solving Jules' case.

101
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:22,903
Besides,
I am the one that does this.

102
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:26,004
- Wouldn't it be weird if you did it?
- It's weird when anyone does it.

103
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,049
It looks pretty sweet
when Simon Baker does it.

104
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,449
- Simon Baker doesn't do it.
- He doesn't?

105
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:33,102
At least we have that.

106
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,265
Gus let me in
on your little missing persons case.

107
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,808
- You what?
- Your random missing persons case,

108
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,835
- the person you've never met before.
- I've got some good news/bad news

109
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,397
on this Scott Seaver fellow.

110
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,607
- Bad news is he's dead.
- What?

111
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:48,767
Doornail. That's why you had
such a hard time finding him.

112
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,239
Oh, my God.

113
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,997
Man, she really takes
these cases seriously.

114
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,062
It was her boyfriend.
Her college boyfriend.

115
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:04,209
What? You said
she never even met this guy.

116
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,253
- I lied. What difference does it make?
- Why?

117
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:09,406
What could possibly be
the good news coming after that?

118
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:13,774
I was gonna say the good news
is we have a case,

119
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:16,054
because I'm pretty sure
he was murdered.

120
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,764
Psych 412
"A Very Juliet Episode"

121
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,767
Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

122
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:08,265
- What are you doing here so early?
- I'm working the Scott Seaver case.

123
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,940
Juliet needs closure.

124
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,611
- We did a terrible thing.
- No, you did a terrible thing.

125
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,612
Found it!

126
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,449
- You called your dad in?
- I found the guy in the first place.

127
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,660
- What?
- With my help.

128
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,287
You sat here and ate munchos
while I called in Sacramento.

129
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,915
- I was on the missing persons website.
- The band missing persons.

130
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:27,793
Check out this report
I was able to find.

131
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,505
- I found that too.
- That is the worst murder cover-up.

132
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,007
Scott Seaver was pronounced
dead 4 1/2 years ago, right?

133
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,260
Car totaled
on a lonely stretch of highway,

134
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,096
in the California desert,
windows down.

135
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,974
- So?
- So it was 42 degrees that night.

136
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:44,461
More importantly, cars don't
suddenly blow up on their own.

137
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:47,521
They certainly don't blow up in a way
so there's no trace of anything.

138
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,616
- So what's next?
- So glad you asked,

139
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,769
because the thing is...

140
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:57,088
I managed to get onto a website
that I probably shouldn't be on.

141
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:59,526
Don't tell me you're going
all Pete Townsend on me.

142
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:02,215
I finally busted out
my treasury department password.

143
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,203
What?

144
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,653
You don't have a treasury
department password.

145
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:08,424
No, but agent Lars Ewing did,

146
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:11,503
and he was really lousy at using
his other hand to cover his typing hand.

147
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,175
- Why my computer?
- 'Cause it's nice.

148
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:33,274
We just got
a hit on the name Scott Seaver.

149
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:38,280
- Is it local?
- Fairly.

150
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,114
Are you sure it's cool for us
to be in the chief's office?

151
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:51,543
Of course, it is.
I practically run this place.

152
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,420
Hit the deck!

153
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:57,747
It's the biscuit lady.

154
00:11:58,613 --> 00:11:59,797
We're good.

155
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:02,596
I owe her 80 cents.

156
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:08,517
I kind of made out with her
at the department picnic.

157
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,853
Here are my findings.

158
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:13,106
Turns out Juliet's boyfriend
was working for a company

159
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,100
- owned by the infamous J.T. Waring.
- Who?

160
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:18,070
- Come on. She wrote the Harry Potters.
- That's J.K. Rowling.

161
00:12:18,356 --> 00:12:20,918
J.T. Waring
is a Los Angeles mobster.

162
00:12:21,043 --> 00:12:22,783
Went down for racketeering
few years ago.

163
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:25,285
- What's racketeering?
- Nobody knows.

164
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:26,953
Get down!

165
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:33,835
- That was a dude.
- That must have been some crazy picnic.

166
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:36,548
So this building was
Waring's legitimate front.

167
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,124
I think this Seaver guy
got in over his head

168
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,149
and someone took him down...

169
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:42,529
hard.

170
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:48,009
One of us is gonna have to grill Juliet
on her dead boyfriend.

171
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:51,186
- I nominate you.
- Wait. We're gonna interrogate her now?

172
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:53,301
Hasn't she been
through enough already?

173
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:55,064
We'll all do it together...

174
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:56,791
very delicately.

175
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,931
We were thinking collectively,

176
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:13,166
that it might be nice if you told us
a little more about Scott.

177
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:17,546
Especially his darkest tendencies,
priors, fetishes.

178
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:27,681
- Gus, what are you doing?
- I'm a sympathetic crier.

179
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:29,558
I am not crying.

180
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,004
Can't you just give me a little time
to get my thoughts together?

181
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:40,704
- That was your fault.
- Fetishes?

182
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:42,429
Tell eye faucets here.

183
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,867
- For God sakes, man.
- No, I'm fine.

184
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:52,419
I'm so sorry.

185
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:55,895
I don't usually do horrible things
to people that I care about. I don't.

186
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,370
Shawn, it's okay.

187
00:13:57,687 --> 00:14:00,281
It was actually really nice
of you to ask about him.

188
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,704
He was a wonderful, wonderful guy.

189
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:04,709
Yeah, he sounds like it.

190
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:07,567
I was crazy about him.

191
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:09,962
My girlfriends said
it was because he was so tall.

192
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:11,924
I love tall guys.

193
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,201
But for me, it was...

194
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:16,645
It was his heart and his soul,

195
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:18,575
his athleticism.

196
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:21,831
- Let me guess... he played football.
- Tight end.

197
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:26,213
Sometimes we tend
to romanticize the past.

198
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:27,987
I'm sure you know that.

199
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:30,354
No, not with Scott.

200
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:33,853
He was just so secure

201
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:35,459
and genuine...

202
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:37,583
Optimistic and youthful.

203
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,342
He had
this rare figurine collection.

204
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,656
Dumbo.
I loved dumbo when I was a kid,

205
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,034
and he gave me one when I turned 18,

206
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,228
broke up a set.
It was hugely valuable as a set,

207
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:51,306
and he gave it to me, 'cause it meant
something to me when I was 18.

208
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:53,845
You like tall men and fat animals.

209
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:55,828
Yes, I do.

210
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:58,076
He had this connection

211
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:00,507
through his late grandfather's office
with the mayor,

212
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:03,538
and he actually got us
Super Bowl tickets.

213
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,936
- 35 yard line.
- Super... Bowl?

214
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,573
It was the most exciting night
of my life.

215
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,202
Get out of here!

216
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,289
You and your black friend,
get out of here!

217
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,583
I actually feel better.

218
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:23,378
That makes me so happy.

219
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,919
Come here, 'cause we talked it out.

220
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:33,932
God, it feels so happy.

221
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,483
- Should we keep walking?
- Sure.

222
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,045
The county sheriff
was no help at all,

223
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,361
and the accident scene
where Scott crashed his car?

224
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:48,753
It's now a mini-mall.

225
00:15:48,878 --> 00:15:51,334
How nobody could have taken
one single photograph,

226
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:54,202
it just doesn't make any sense.
These guys are a bunch of jackasses.

227
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,999
Dad, thanks for trying,

228
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:57,968
and bonus points for
using the word "jackass"

229
00:15:58,093 --> 00:15:59,987
in another conversation
unironically.

230
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:03,051
You've been on the phone?
So you haven't heard anything I said.

231
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:04,529
The complaining? No, I heard.

232
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:07,591
We've been going in the wrong direction
for about two hours now.

233
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,344
I know that look.
What are you on to?

234
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,762
Dumbo figurines.

235
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:18,867
Turns out,
those figurines are extremely rare,

236
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:21,240
maybe three complete sets
in the world.

237
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:24,751
Did a little search on eBay.
Someone is selling the exact set,

238
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:26,985
minus the piece
that Scott gave to Jules.

239
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,495
This is the apartment of this person?
I'll call Lassie.

240
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,057
No, that'll take too long.

241
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:33,415
Besides, I have no idea
whose jurisdiction we're in.

242
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,715
Here's the thing.

243
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,495
I think Scott was murdered,

244
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,663
robbed.

245
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,293
The killer thinks the coast is clear.
He's finally selling off his belongings.

246
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,087
- All we have to do is find the seller.
- We just did!

247
00:16:48,996 --> 00:16:51,726
You knocked on the door of a murderer,
and all you can say is "ooh"?

248
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:54,012
I should have thought about it
before I said it out loud,

249
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:56,124
but I wanted a fun reveal for you.

250
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,064
Got some good news
and some bad news.

251
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,815
Remember I told you
that Scott Seaver guy was dead?

252
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:11,053
- Shawn, not now.
- Well, here's the good news.

253
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,150
Oh, my God.

254
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:22,812
I can't believe it!

255
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,548
That's probably enough of that.

256
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,760
I can't believe
I'm... I'm seeing you.

257
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,637
There's so much I want to tell you.

258
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:40,447
What's the bad news?

259
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:43,322
There is no bad news.

260
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,553
- Actually, there is.
- This is Daniel Wayne.

261
00:17:46,678 --> 00:17:49,401
He's a federal marshal.
These are the two who found Mr. Seaver.

262
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,825
- You did this?
- Yes, we did, but don't worry.

263
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,322
There's no need for a reward.

264
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:55,576
That's good,

265
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,656
because we generally
don't give out rewards

266
00:17:57,781 --> 00:18:00,453
for exposing a key witness right
out of witness protection.

267
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,824
And after college, I landed a job

268
00:18:11,949 --> 00:18:15,149
as an imports appraiser
for a company in Los Angeles,

269
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,345
but it wasn't till later I found out
that one

270
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,681
of the company's silent partners
was J.T. Waring.

271
00:18:20,284 --> 00:18:23,476
Who was a well-known figure
in organized crime circles down there.

272
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,770
- You were working for a criminal?
- I didn't know.

273
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,313
Waring was using it as a front

274
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,483
for a number of criminal activities
without the knowledge of his employees,

275
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:33,475
so we raided his business,
and we took him into custody.

276
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,530
And that's when I found
out what was going on.

277
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,035
Waring killed a federal agent
during the raid.

278
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,369
Mr. Seaver's testimony placed him
in the room with the dead agent,

279
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,289
effectively securing
his life sentence.

280
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,832
Mr. Seaver here's a hero.

281
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:49,711
I'm sure any of us would have
done the same in his place.

282
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,634
No.

283
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:53,728
Remember when you saw that accident
and then you pretended to be blind?

284
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:55,717
That's different.
Our movie was in 8 minutes.

285
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,305
Why would you bring that up?

286
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,882
You were willing to risk your life
to put a dangerous man behind bars?

287
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:03,756
Mr. Seaver is a great American.

288
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:05,726
Who worked for a criminal.

289
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,062
And now his life
may be in grave danger.

290
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:11,044
Mr. Waring is very well-connected,
even behind bars.

291
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:14,402
These people hold grudges,
and they pay for them in blood.

292
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:18,865
Fortunately, I have my team
preparing a new identity for Mr. Seaver.

293
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:19,949
I'm not going.

294
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:23,909
My life is here.

295
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,613
Not only did you show up
at the train station,

296
00:19:26,738 --> 00:19:29,876
but when I wasn't there,
You searched high and low for me.

297
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:34,301
I appreciate everything
that you people have done for me,

298
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:37,509
but you got to understand, witness
protection, it might as well be prison.

299
00:19:37,737 --> 00:19:40,261
I never felt comfortable,
and I never felt safe.

300
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:41,990
I vote he goes back.

301
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,677
You will never be safe
out of protection.

302
00:19:44,802 --> 00:19:47,185
Once they make you, you're gone.

303
00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:50,855
Waring is serving
three life sentences.

304
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,180
I'm not the biggest piece
of the puzzle here.

305
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,527
The bottom line is I'm out,

306
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,695
I'm safe,

307
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,379
and I don't care.

308
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:08,808
What, all of a sudden,
this is my fault?

309
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:09,874
What about Gus?

310
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,465
I didn't have a chance
to cook for anybody in protection.

311
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:19,916
When a date asks,
"tell me about you"

312
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,950
you have to answer
from a government-issued note card.

313
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:24,888
When you were in the program,

314
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,685
did you ever order spaghetti marinara
and get egg noodles and ketchup instead?

315
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,106
- What do you mean?
- It's from <i>Goodfellas</i>. Never mind.

316
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:35,692
I get it. No, I don't.

317
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,185
Look at this spice rack.
All the seals unbroken.

318
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,712
Yeah, I don't really get a chance
to cook for anyone, either.

319
00:20:43,837 --> 00:20:44,837
Cop hours.

320
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,694
Finally regretting that choice
not to attend clown college?

321
00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:56,768
How do we do this?

322
00:20:57,243 --> 00:21:00,425
I guess we start
from seven years ago

323
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,135
and move on from there,

324
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:05,763
- and leave out all the boring parts.
- What if there are no boring parts?

325
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:08,892
Then this is going to be
a very long conversation.

326
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,799
- What's that?
- I am so sorry,

327
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:18,433
but I'm gonna have to tell you
to move away from the window.

328
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:27,526
Male about 5'8". I chased him off.
I don't know how he slipped past me.

329
00:21:27,651 --> 00:21:29,768
You stay put.
I got back-up on the way.

330
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:32,743
Wait. This isn't a date?
You're protecting me?

331
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,905
Look, we need to get him
back into protection, okay?

332
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,176
I got a guy who can disappear
with him.

333
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,038
Waring's men are out there.

334
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:49,167
Agent Wayne, you know as well as anyone
that Mr. Seaver is a private citizen,

335
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,577
and he isn't legally compelled
to do any such thing.

336
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,674
We are doing everything
we can to ensure his safety.

337
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,898
Posting one cop
outside her exposed apartment

338
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,608
while she plays grab-ass inside?

339
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,320
Who was in your apartment?

340
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,782
The truth of the matter is,
we may have overreacted last night.

341
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,577
We never actually saw the assailant,
or the alleged assailant.

342
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,760
What time are we talking,
before or after <i>Conan</i>?

343
00:22:11,885 --> 00:22:13,498
A person was seen,
we chased him off.

344
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:17,081
- We can't be sure he came after Scott.
- Listen, girl,

345
00:22:17,358 --> 00:22:19,074
I don't care.

346
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,763
Tommy Lee Jones!

347
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:22,799
- What?
- <i>Fugitive</i>.

348
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,173
You're missing some of the country...
Shake it off.

349
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:28,018
- Let's try it again. I'll be Harrison.
- You know,

350
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:29,764
I used to have some respect,

351
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,120
and you have single-handedly
let this guy destroy my career.

352
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:35,728
I get it, agent Wayne.
You're very important.

353
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,898
But why don't you let me handle
my people when you're in this building?

354
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,483
All right, everybody relax.

355
00:22:41,018 --> 00:22:42,652
I admit that some of this
is my fault.

356
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,575
- Much of it.
- All.

357
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,949
But we recognize the trouble
that we have caused.

358
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:51,090
I have a plan, and I will fix it.

359
00:22:57,044 --> 00:23:00,381
This is your fix, Shawn? The man is
a convicted murderer. He will kill us.

360
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:04,510
Don't be the "it" in "wait for it!"
This is gonna work great.

361
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:11,405
Hello, Mr. Waring.

362
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,850
My name is Shawn Spencer,
well-known psychic detective,

363
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:16,979
and this is my associate,
Burton Guster.

364
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,033
Now you wanna use my real name?

365
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:22,025
We'd like to ask you a question
about one Scott Seaver.

366
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,023
You mean now that he's out
of witness protection?

367
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:27,530
- You knew that?
- You just confirmed it for me.

368
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:30,971
I can't catch a break this week,
can I?

369
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:32,324
What do you want?

370
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:34,607
We were hoping we could
come here and appeal to you

371
00:23:34,732 --> 00:23:36,122
so that nothing happens to him.

372
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,708
Scott Seaver
is the reason I'm in here.

373
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:43,504
Scott Seaver worked for you
for two years.

374
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,254
- He had no beef with you.
- Why are you talking in an accent?

375
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:49,761
- I'm speaking this man's language.
- The man's language is English, Shawn.

376
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,262
What's your point?

377
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:53,562
I have a point. It's this:

378
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,690
Scott Seaver is a decent guy,
trying to live his life

379
00:23:56,815 --> 00:24:00,271
in a decent way, and I am sensing
that you are also a decent man.

380
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,024
Perhaps it will ease
your conscience a bit to let him be.

381
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,389
You sense I'm a decent man?

382
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,833
Plus, you're serving
three consecutive life sentences,

383
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,434
so Scott's testimony that put you
in the room with the body

384
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:14,077
doesn't really mean much
not in the grand scheme of things.

385
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:16,905
Look, Mr. Spencer.

386
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:20,428
Sometimes things happen
without my knowledge.

387
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,327
People on the outside
want to do things for me,

388
00:24:23,452 --> 00:24:25,402
whether I ask them to or not.

389
00:24:25,771 --> 00:24:27,715
I have that kind of effect
on people.

390
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,861
Course, they do. You're super cool.

391
00:24:31,657 --> 00:24:32,840
My question is:

392
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:36,224
could you ask those people
to not do those things to Scott?

393
00:24:38,516 --> 00:24:40,466
Perhaps. What's in it for me?

394
00:24:41,385 --> 00:24:44,785
How about I bake you a cake
that's extra high in... iron?

395
00:24:46,102 --> 00:24:49,195
I have a far less ridiculous
counter-proposal for you.

396
00:24:49,686 --> 00:24:52,949
If you are a psychic,
how about you prove something for me?

397
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:55,368
What's that?
Stop it.

398
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,161
That I didn't kill that man.

399
00:24:58,578 --> 00:25:01,314
Seriously, Shawn, of course
he's gonna say he's not guilty.

400
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:03,017
All cons are innocent.

401
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:04,537
Let's just hear him out.

402
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,963
The dead marshal at the raid,
agent Renfro...

403
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,714
He was dead when I found him.

404
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:12,886
I was at the wrong place at wrong time,
and the murder got pinned on me.

405
00:25:13,437 --> 00:25:15,050
My God, he's convincing.

406
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:17,069
Convincing? He's a criminal.

407
00:25:17,194 --> 00:25:18,891
Yes, but he has a great head,

408
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,413
and a real presence. There's something
very Billy Zane-Ian about him.

409
00:25:22,538 --> 00:25:24,930
You and Billy Zane
are the only ones who use that term.

410
00:25:25,055 --> 00:25:26,467
The man is playing you.

411
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:29,465
He's a murderer, a liar,
and the lowest form of trash.

412
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,185
You know these things don't turn off,
right?

413
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,438
- Do you understand about honor?
- Of course I do.

414
00:25:39,563 --> 00:25:41,841
I have a bootleg copy
of <i>Saving private Ryan</i>.

415
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:44,580
It's the first and last thing
my father taught me.

416
00:25:44,705 --> 00:25:46,794
Without honor, there is nothing.

417
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:50,381
Now, I don't mind serving the time
for a crime I may have committed,

418
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,005
but I don't kill people,

419
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,218
and I can't have my children
think I do.

420
00:25:55,058 --> 00:25:57,805
- I believe you. Yes, I do.
- You do not. Oh, my Gosh.

421
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,246
Then vindicate me,

422
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:01,392
and Mr. Seaver will be safe,

423
00:26:01,785 --> 00:26:03,436
but not until my name is cleared.

424
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,730
Deal?

425
00:26:06,025 --> 00:26:07,684
Don't do it. Don't do it, Shawn.

426
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:10,234
Don't, don't.

427
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:13,321
Deal.

428
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:23,111
I just want you to know

429
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:25,761
that you have my blessing.

430
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:27,233
For what?

431
00:26:27,358 --> 00:26:29,170
To consummate your relationship
with Scott.

432
00:26:31,571 --> 00:26:33,071
I just meant that...

433
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:35,593
Should this thing work out...

434
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:37,970
This guy's okay in my book.

435
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,973
Look, I don't get to be
a confidante all that often...

436
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:45,353
Ever, for anybody,
'cause people don't really talk to me.

437
00:26:45,702 --> 00:26:48,395
So I wanted to give
this careful consideration,

438
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,186
and,
after a thorough background check

439
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:53,361
and an unauthorized blood test,

440
00:26:54,097 --> 00:26:56,112
I get what you see in this guy.

441
00:26:57,861 --> 00:26:59,784
What? You don't seem so sure.

442
00:27:00,174 --> 00:27:03,011
I showed up for a cup of coffee,

443
00:27:03,136 --> 00:27:05,824
and now he thinks
I combed the state for him. I mean,

444
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:08,801
I would think I was a little creepy.

445
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:12,291
It's just a lot to take.
You know what I feel like?

446
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,822
I feel like that scene in <i>Grease</i>.

447
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:17,731
After the bonfire,
when Sandy's sprung on Danny

448
00:27:17,856 --> 00:27:19,606
when he least expects it.

449
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:22,890
What? I can't see movies too?

450
00:27:23,123 --> 00:27:26,185
That is spot on,
with scary precision.

451
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,354
Here's the thing, O'Hara.

452
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:33,018
You haven't seen this guy in,
like, seven years.

453
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:35,194
You're both
entirely different people.

454
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:37,550
The only way
you're gonna know anything

455
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:39,650
is if you get to know
each other again.

456
00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:42,075
Everything else is pure speculation.

457
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:44,618
It's like... wondering
what would have happened

458
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:46,497
if Kenickie had driven
at thunder road.

459
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:50,397
- Are we still on <i>Grease</i>?
- We never weren't.

460
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:03,480
You didn't have to break the window.

461
00:28:03,605 --> 00:28:06,339
What was I gonna do,
climb over the barbed wire fence?

462
00:28:06,464 --> 00:28:09,675
I'm just saying,
the door's been sitting here untouched.

463
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,423
- There's decay.
- Decay?

464
00:28:11,548 --> 00:28:14,847
- This isn't planet of the apes, Gus.
- This was a very fortified building.

465
00:28:14,972 --> 00:28:17,683
Waring was big on security,
so you're both right.

466
00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:19,228
You guys always disagree?

467
00:28:19,353 --> 00:28:21,053
- Always.
- Not always.

468
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,747
- It's weird being in here now.
- So this was Waring's legitimate cover.

469
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:30,875
You weren't aware of any improprieties
going on whatsoever?

470
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,461
- Do you doubt me, Shawn?
- No.

471
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:35,166
Maybe a little.

472
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:39,300
I'm an appraiser, not a smuggler.
Plus, I turned my boss in.

473
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:42,378
I was the one who could place
Waring in the room with the body.

474
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:44,347
- Which room?
- Waring's office.

475
00:28:44,918 --> 00:28:46,268
Right over there.

476
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:51,456
This must be where it happened.

477
00:28:55,175 --> 00:28:57,401
- Get down. Be the body.
- I'm not laying on a floor.

478
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,038
- Come on, man, I'm onto something.
- This is a $260 shirt.

479
00:29:00,163 --> 00:29:02,646
- You got that for 18 bucks.
- List price, Shawn.

480
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,250
- You cannot quote list price.
- There's blood on the floor.

481
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:08,204
That's not blood.
That's clearly crime scene oil.

482
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:11,374
- I've never heard of crime scene oil.
- They stopped using it in the 70s.

483
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,237
F.D.R. was like, "not in my house."

484
00:29:13,362 --> 00:29:15,461
- That makes no sense.
- Whose dad is a cop?

485
00:29:16,052 --> 00:29:18,297
Why's he laying
in the pool of blood?

486
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:20,925
He was being the body.

487
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,481
He was laying
in the wrong direction anyway.

488
00:29:23,606 --> 00:29:24,606
No, Scott,

489
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:26,208
I'm a psychic,

490
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,820
and I'm sensing that the body
was turned in the other direction.

491
00:29:28,945 --> 00:29:29,892
I remember it.

492
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,991
His head was over there.
I came in through the back door,

493
00:29:33,116 --> 00:29:35,126
saw Waring standing over with a gun,

494
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:37,066
and then he ran out the front door.

495
00:29:38,387 --> 00:29:41,194
Let me ask you something.
Why did they need you?

496
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,530
Couldn't they have convicted him
with the bullet?

497
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,848
The bullet went
right through the guy.

498
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,909
And they never found it.
Didn't you read the trial transcript?

499
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:52,420
Yeah, Gus, that was right at
the top of my "to don't" list.

500
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:53,749
Excuse me.

501
00:29:57,136 --> 00:29:58,838
You should stop doubting this guy.

502
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,090
I don't know.
Nothing he says holds any water.

503
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:03,726
Everything you've said
in the last 2 days has been wrong.

504
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:06,387
That's false. I was right
about Mr. T in <i>The blues brothers</i>.

505
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:08,305
I'm talking about the case.

506
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,410
All right, fine.

507
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:14,369
Let's just say, for argument's sake,
that you're right.

508
00:30:14,677 --> 00:30:17,472
The body was this way,
and the head was down there.

509
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:18,997
That would mean...

510
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,491
<i>The bullet went
right through the guy.</i>

511
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:44,967
I think I know
where the bullet went.

512
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:51,275
- You know those are backwards?
- What?

513
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:55,277
That makes
all the difference in the world.

514
00:30:55,826 --> 00:30:58,364
- You're looking too low, Shawn.
- No, I'm not.

515
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,472
That window was 20 feet
off the ground.

516
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:02,916
The coroner's report
said that the exit

517
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:05,025
and entry wounds
were the same height.

518
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,355
That means the bullet
traveled relatively straight.

519
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,625
Sometimes I have to help my partner
with the police aspect.

520
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,395
- But you're not compensating.
- I most certainly am.

521
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,192
But you're looking at the forest
like it was five years ago.

522
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:17,865
Yeah, trees grow.

523
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,990
Exactly.

524
00:31:25,232 --> 00:31:26,232
Holy...

525
00:31:26,936 --> 00:31:28,344
Is that what I think it is?

526
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,929
Shimmy up a little higher.

527
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:33,224
- Stop worrying about your fingernails.
- This thing is covered with sap and

528
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:36,143
I have very sensitive cuticles,
and if you're so great,

529
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,561
why don't you come up here
and do it?

530
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:42,508
Gentlemen,

531
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,778
I think we may have
just found ourselves a bullet.

532
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,115
Guy with a gun! We need to go!

533
00:31:50,698 --> 00:31:53,060
- You're supposed to bring me!
- Jump!

534
00:31:53,185 --> 00:31:55,120
- It's too high!
- It's not that high!

535
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,038
They want Scott, not you!

536
00:32:07,608 --> 00:32:11,136
- This better be good, Mr. Spencer.
- It'll be good, chief. Please.

537
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:15,266
There is a bullet in this tree.
It's in a tiny hole.

538
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:18,052
You cannot see it,
but my senses have led us here.

539
00:32:18,177 --> 00:32:19,095
We can see it.

540
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,948
You need a ladder

541
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:23,139
or a psychic third eye
to see it from there.

542
00:32:23,264 --> 00:32:26,902
Lodged deep in the trunk is the bullet
that killed agent Xavier Renfro.

543
00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:29,055
That's not his name.

544
00:32:29,612 --> 00:32:31,099
- We see the hole.
- No, Jules,

545
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:33,367
you'd need binoculars
to see it from that vantage point.

546
00:32:43,488 --> 00:32:45,421
Someone must have
gotten here before us.

547
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,647
- Who?
- The real killer.

548
00:33:03,222 --> 00:33:05,679
You've reached a new level
of recklessness,

549
00:33:05,804 --> 00:33:07,687
and, unfortunately,
it's become necessary

550
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,279
to issue you both formal reprimands.

551
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,239
On what grounds?

552
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:15,460
How about
misuse of a federal database?

553
00:33:15,943 --> 00:33:17,889
Informing a convicted criminal

554
00:33:18,014 --> 00:33:21,332
that his accuser
is out of protection, trespassing,

555
00:33:21,724 --> 00:33:25,520
- assisting an incarcerated murderer.
- These are crimes? Is this North Korea?

556
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:28,379
They all are, except the last,
which is just poor judgment.

557
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,716
- Did agent Wayne put you up to this?
- He wanted charges brought against you.

558
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:34,763
I cannot believe
that you are bowing down to this man.

559
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:38,306
Can someone give me a reason why he is
so obsessed with this silly little case?

560
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:40,642
Because the agent who died
was his partner.

561
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:43,927
You should just stop talking
until this streak blows over.

562
00:33:44,052 --> 00:33:45,521
May I speak with agent Wayne?

563
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,692
Agent Wayne is escorting a witness
to a handler to go back into protection.

564
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:52,230
- Not Scott.
- Yeah. He agreed to go back in.

565
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,157
Getting shot at
in the forest was a real eye-opener.

566
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,525
And, besides, you just missed him.

567
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,050
Mr. Spencer, now.

568
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,011
Holy crap.

569
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:20,348
It was him. It was Wayne!
He's the one that dug the bullet out.

570
00:34:21,382 --> 00:34:23,977
Honestly, you are scraping

571
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,257
- the bottom of the barrel now.
- You're not listening.

572
00:34:26,382 --> 00:34:28,190
He was there the night
of the shooting.

573
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,586
He was. Why do you think
he's so passionate?

574
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:32,422
That is not why he was
so passionate!

575
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:35,656
Scott Seaver did not witness a murder.
He witnessed a cover-up.

576
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,430
Somebody might want to follow me!

577
00:35:46,055 --> 00:35:48,186
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Spencer?

578
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:50,314
- I'll have you arrested.
- That's funny.

579
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,775
I was about to say you
the same thing.

580
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,526
On what grounds?

581
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,677
Let's see here... murder,
attempted murder,

582
00:35:57,802 --> 00:36:00,823
conspiracy, unlawful carving
of a spruce tree.

583
00:36:01,174 --> 00:36:01,992
What?

584
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
You're the one
that dug the bullet out.

585
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:08,415
The one that killed your partner,
the one that came from your gun.

586
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,693
It was you. You did it.

587
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:18,172
Wait a second.

588
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,866
It was an accident, wasn't it?

589
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:24,291
You saw a gun, and you saw a figure,

590
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:26,698
and you thought it was Waring.

591
00:36:26,823 --> 00:36:29,773
Then Waring came in,
saw the body on the ground,

592
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,521
pulled his gun.

593
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:34,329
And that's when Scott came in,

594
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,320
he found Waring standing over the body,
and then saw Waring flee the scene.

595
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:41,742
When you got to the room,
you realized your horrible mistake.

596
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,111
Your partner laying lifeless
on the ground,

597
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:47,086
the only one that could
have shot him was you.

598
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,541
You repositioned the body,
made it look like Waring had shot him,

599
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,807
and then you pinned
the whole thing on Waring.

600
00:36:52,932 --> 00:36:54,773
Murder conviction was a lock,

601
00:36:54,898 --> 00:36:56,720
followed by a sentence
which Waring deserved,

602
00:36:56,845 --> 00:36:58,853
but always eluded,
because of his cool demeanor

603
00:36:58,978 --> 00:37:00,561
and Billy Zane-Ian qualities.

604
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,553
Let's be honest,
that man has a presence.

605
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:05,599
But perhaps most importantly,
it meant

606
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,933
your partner agent Renfro
didn't die in vain.

607
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,145
I really wish you hadn't said that.

608
00:37:12,424 --> 00:37:13,574
Sorry, Wayne.

609
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,148
No take backs.

610
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,851
You know, getting rid of him,

611
00:37:19,646 --> 00:37:20,946
that was gonna be easy.

612
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,240
You, not so much.

613
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,243
Just let it go, man.
You're clearly outnumbered.

614
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:27,896
Really?

615
00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:35,377
Guess that evens things up a bit.

616
00:37:35,897 --> 00:37:37,047
You think so?

617
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,216
Oh, boy.

618
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,843
You're gonna hide behind
your little gun, huh?

619
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:44,803
Come on.

620
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,110
Put that thing down.
Take me on <i>mano a mano</i>, huh?

621
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:52,144
Just two dudes going at it.
Two unevenly-matched dudes?

622
00:37:52,894 --> 00:37:53,770
Where am I?

623
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:56,982
You gonna be able to bend those things?
Can you bend those bullets?

624
00:37:57,629 --> 00:37:59,526
I always hate
when they make that speech.

625
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:01,570
Who's gonna drop their,
you know, gun...

626
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:06,781
I'm not proud of that.

627
00:38:14,724 --> 00:38:17,174
Scott Seaver
was a convenient witness,

628
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,164
right place, wrong time!

629
00:38:25,116 --> 00:38:26,775
Putting him in witness protection

630
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,296
would ensure that there were
no questions left behind!

631
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:33,644
Dude, did you see what I just did?

632
00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:45,455
You're not gonna kill me.
You're not a cold-blooded murderer.

633
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,045
- Otherwise you would have killed Scott.
- The only difference is,

634
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,869
I didn't have to kill him.

635
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:35,733
- Federal agent, you idiot.
- Not anymore.

636
00:39:46,863 --> 00:39:48,213
So what happened?

637
00:39:49,278 --> 00:39:52,242
Gave him the old <i>mano a mano</i> speech.

638
00:39:52,502 --> 00:39:54,752
- Did it work?
- Not even sort of.

639
00:39:55,418 --> 00:39:56,548
Then what?

640
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,452
- Had to knock him out, Gus.
- I thought Scott knocked him out.

641
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:02,406
I've heard it both ways.

642
00:40:09,548 --> 00:40:11,390
I have a confession to make.

643
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:14,851
I didn't come looking for you
last week.

644
00:40:14,976 --> 00:40:16,776
Shawn did, all on his own.

645
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,470
I know.

646
00:40:18,905 --> 00:40:19,905
You do?

647
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,518
I guess I was kind of hoping
it was you.

648
00:40:23,643 --> 00:40:25,193
I would have...

649
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:28,319
If I thought
you were really in trouble.

650
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:33,411
Where does this leave us?

651
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:36,771
I'm not sure.

652
00:40:38,922 --> 00:40:40,366
Seeing you again...

653
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:42,926
changed so much in my life.

654
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,270
Me too.

655
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,696
But I don't even know
what my life is right now.

656
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,932
Right now. I mean,
I lost five years of it. I guess,

657
00:40:52,057 --> 00:40:54,489
someday, I might, but...

658
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:56,484
The thing is...

659
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:58,623
I have an idea.

660
00:41:00,012 --> 00:41:01,012
How about,

661
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:03,002
in three years,

662
00:41:04,183 --> 00:41:05,883
we meet right back here?

663
00:41:08,982 --> 00:41:09,985
Same time.

664
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:23,897
See you.

665
00:41:36,252 --> 00:41:37,482
One problem.

666
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,822
Three years is too long.

667
00:41:43,153 --> 00:41:44,918
- How about two?
- How about one?

668
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:49,059
See you then.
