1
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:18,059
What in blue blazes is going on?
You're up on the roof in this weather?

2
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,163
Nothing, Dad.

3
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:22,552
We were just practicing base jumping.
It's the newest thing in extreme sports.

4
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:23,932
Are you crazy?

5
00:00:24,114 --> 00:00:25,516
You could get yourself hurt

6
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:27,526
or maybe even killed
doing something like this.

7
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:28,633
Don't worry.

8
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:31,739
We made life-size replicas of ourselves
to make sure the chutes would work.

9
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:34,533
Mine's over there.
We've made improvements since then.

10
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:36,264
Base jumping.

11
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:38,913
There's no way I'm gonna let you do
something that risky.

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,990
- But, dad?
- But nothing.

13
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:44,168
As long as you live in my house
you follow my rules.

14
00:00:44,514 --> 00:00:47,992
Now, I want you to clean this stuff up,
come inside, and do your homework.

15
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:50,424
Gus, come on.
You're smarter than this.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,743
One day I won't be living
in your house.

17
00:00:53,868 --> 00:00:55,838
Then I'll be able
to take any risk I want.

18
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:57,119
What about that?

19
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:00,504
When you and Gus are 30 years old
you can go out

20
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:03,020
and be as wild and reckless
as you want.

21
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:07,464
Best idea ever.

22
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:10,894
People say our intense love of bunnies
is creepy at our age,

23
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:13,187
but history will prove them
to be heartless bastards.

24
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:15,700
I can't believe the French
actually eat these little guys.

25
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,577
- The French aren't the only ones.
- I wasn't counting other rabbits.

26
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:21,957
- Rabbits don't eat each other.
- Most rabbits, yes.

27
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,376
No, pretty much all.
This conversation will only end badly.

28
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,752
The thing is...

29
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:31,692
- I have something big to tell you.
- You know you can say anything to me.

30
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:34,051
We've known each other forever
and there is nothing

31
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,679
- that could dent our bond.
- I have a secret girlfriend.

32
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:38,391
You're dead.
I can't believe you.

33
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,732
You brought me here
to get hopped up on bunny love

34
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:42,351
so I wouldn't make a scene.

35
00:01:42,692 --> 00:01:44,317
- Pretty much.
- It's working.

36
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:47,148
I don't even remember
what this whole thing was about.

37
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,734
This bunny is strong.
Must be Columbian.

38
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,070
Her name is Ruby.

39
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:54,155
I met her at BevMo! She's in marketing.
And she's really, really cool.

40
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,868
- She's not taking you to the cleaners?
- All my cash is tied up in dress shirts

41
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,808
- and decorative pillowcases.
- Fair.

42
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,762
- Why are you waiting till just now?
- Because I wanted to make sure

43
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:07,084
that what we had was real and solid.
I didn't want you screwing things up.

44
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:12,074
Your decision could have
repercussions for years to come.

45
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:15,092
The thing is, you have a tendency
to scare my girlfriends away.

46
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,886
Because I ask
a few simple questions?

47
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:19,345
You asked if she knew
the answer to the <i>Riddle of the Sphinx</i>.

48
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,432
And bullet dodged.
You're very welcome.

49
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,434
You knew
because you saw it on <i>Super friends</i>.

50
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:26,729
She had the same opportunity
to see that episode.

51
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:27,938
All right, you.

52
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,953
What are you doing?
Pick that bunny back up.

53
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:32,067
I will not be easily swayed

54
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,613
or impressed by the effects
of an intense adorability high.

55
00:02:36,017 --> 00:02:38,319
As far as I'm concerned
she's starting here.

56
00:02:38,444 --> 00:02:40,019
And she's gotta get to here.

57
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,661
It's not gonna be easy.
When do I meet her?

58
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:44,961
- In about three seconds.
- Three seconds...

59
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,775
Hi, handsome.

60
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,794
- Right back at ya.
- She was talking to me.

61
00:02:50,454 --> 00:02:52,421
Ruby, this is Shawn.

62
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,966
It's good to meet you. Sorry I ran late.
My last appointment ran long.

63
00:02:56,824 --> 00:02:58,912
She volunteers
at the Wildlife Rescue.

64
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,223
We were just cleaning up the ducks
that got caught up in the oil spill.

65
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:05,790
Wait a minute.
That sounded a little rehearsed.

66
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:08,891
- Did he give you that?
- You are as kooky as Gus advertised.

67
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:12,024
Although, you, mister,
did not do justice to that hair.

68
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:15,443
My God, most guys I know
would kill for that mane.

69
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:16,606
Some have.

70
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,045
Well, not me.

71
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,788
I like Gus's head.
It would be a crime to cover this up.

72
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,497
- Got some questions for you Rubes.
- Shoot.

73
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,077
- Anything.
- Anything?

74
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:30,254
- Good. Favorite color.
- Black.

75
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:31,462
- Liar.
- Prove it.

76
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:32,766
- Flavor.
- Of what?

77
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:34,088
- Everything.
- Mango.

78
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,608
- Too easy.
- Anything else?

79
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,550
Favorite... <i>Magnum, P.I.</i> episode.

80
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:39,927
<i>Did you see the Sun Rise?</i>

81
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,807
- Second favorite episode.
- <i>Did you see the Sun Rise: Part two?</i>

82
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,590
Actually, reverse those two.

83
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,980
My God, who are you?

84
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,428
- It was good to meet you, Shawn.
- It was good to meet you, Rubes.

85
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:58,611
- You've exceeded all expectations.
- Oh, thank you.

86
00:03:58,736 --> 00:04:01,147
And might I say
that you and Gus have

87
00:04:01,272 --> 00:04:03,930
one of the most rich and fulfilling
friendships that I've ever seen.

88
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:08,052
We're like Andie and Duckie
with just a tad of Mary Kate and Ashley.

89
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:11,243
- Aren't we glad that that's over?
- Yes, we are.

90
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,838
I guess all that's left now
is for me to meet your friends.

91
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,714
- You mean, for me to meet her friends.
- No, I had it right the first time.

92
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,594
We can change it to we.
When do we get to meet your friends?

93
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:25,560
I'm free now.

94
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,796
Ten minutes from now.
Roughly, an hour from now.

95
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,770
- Anytime between now and tonight.
- That's a little short notice.

96
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:34,479
I would love to,

97
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,234
- but I have this thing planned today.
- We would love to come.

98
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:39,653
Okay, normally I would say great...

99
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,678
Seriously... but we're meeting
at Berman's bend down by the river

100
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:44,407
and we only have so many supplies.

101
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:46,582
Not enough supplies.

102
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,371
We'll put something on the books
for next week.

103
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,373
Good. Thank you.
Sounds good, sounds good.

104
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,227
You know that's right.

105
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,469
I can't believe
we're crashing their picnic.

106
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,803
- You asked me to vet this woman.
- No, I didn't.

107
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,131
Regardless, when I vet someone I vet
until there is no vetting left to vet.

108
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:10,684
That is how I vet.

109
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,319
- Ruby passed your test.
- She was good at the pet store.

110
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:14,794
She was prepared.

111
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:16,715
Gotta catch
her and her friends unaware

112
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,925
before they have a chance
to get their story straight.

113
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,898
I like this woman.
I don't want you to mess it up for me.

114
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:24,231
Dude, deep down,
you want this to happen.

115
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:27,198
You want me to do this so that you can
avoid another Mira situation.

116
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:30,011
Or have you already forgotten the woman
you married after only two days?

117
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:31,306
Ruby is not Mira.

118
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,136
And I don't need you to tell me
whether a woman is right for me.

119
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:35,452
You sure about that?

120
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:37,137
Almost.
90%.

121
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:38,869
- Dude.
- Fine, 81%.

122
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,882
Then let the vetting continue.

123
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:53,352
- I'm sorry we're dropping in.
- But we agreed to do this next week.

124
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,064
- We don't have enough supplies.
- We brought our own gruyere.

125
00:05:58,764 --> 00:06:00,901
I think you wanted
to catch me off guard

126
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,393
to see what I was like
with my friends, didn't you?

127
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:05,280
That's what I thought.

128
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,963
This is Gus and Shawn.
These are my friends.

129
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,291
This is Derek Walker.
Jessica Martino

130
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,081
and my other friend Stu Crawford.

131
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,415
Stu...

132
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:18,919
Sounds like I'm booing.
Right? But I'm not.

133
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,170
I'm saying Stu,

134
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,211
because I'm a fan of yours
and your guys' whole team.

135
00:06:23,336 --> 00:06:25,175
I'm sorry
we're crashing in on your...

136
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:26,510
River rafting.

137
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:27,933
River rafting?

138
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:29,888
We thought you guys
were having a picnic.

139
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,765
You know, 'cause it's lunch time.

140
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,350
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.

141
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:35,171
Let me explain.

142
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:37,429
Lunch for us starts ten minutes
after breakfast ends

143
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:39,817
and goes till ten minutes
before dinner starts.

144
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,650
Unless we just combine the two,
in which case we have linner.

145
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,529
And then there's dessinner,
which is dessert and dinner.

146
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:48,782
You're fun. You're not crashing
anything. We got plenty of room.

147
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,868
Go see Gunther, he'll fix you up.

148
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:53,629
- And meet us down by the river.
- Sweet.

149
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:56,907
Are you sure this is waterproof?

150
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:59,222
You barely get wet.
I've done this hundreds of times.

151
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:02,895
- It's a small world doesn't count.
- All right, fine, Mr. Qualifier.

152
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:06,091
Guys, please, let us help with that.

153
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:12,519
I've met each of you now.

154
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:15,034
And I'm sure you're more
than a little curious about me.

155
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,736
Actually, I am.
Ruby says you're a psychic?

156
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:21,439
Can you turn on your powers
and predict my future?

157
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,733
Derek, I'm a diviner.
Not a blender.

158
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:26,445
The psychic realm decides
when it wants to communicate with me.

159
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:35,746
Though I am sensing that Stu here

160
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:37,466
is the expert.

161
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:38,874
That's right.

162
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:41,085
He is the most experienced
of the group.

163
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,046
It was his idea to come here today.

164
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:47,382
That's pretty good.
What else can you tell?

165
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:50,843
Well, I can tell you that Jessica here
is a bit of a free spirit.

166
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,515
Single but looking.
Not afraid to make the first move.

167
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:56,600
Nice.
How'd you know that?

168
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:57,935
She's tickling my ass.

169
00:07:58,306 --> 00:08:00,406
That was completely by accident.

170
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:01,682
This time.

171
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,616
So, Ruby, you still haven't told me
how you and your friends met.

172
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:16,954
Derek and Stu met
at a wildlife preservation meeting,

173
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,937
which is kind of ironic

174
00:08:19,062 --> 00:08:22,876
because Derek used to be a big game
hunter back when he was dating Jessica.

175
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:26,432
Yeah, I went to Africa with him twice,
but only for the pictures.

176
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:29,133
I look really good
in a safari outfit.

177
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,441
I bagged the big 5,
then I turned over a new leaf.

178
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:33,570
Big 5?

179
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:36,807
Mouse, squirrel, turtle,
Chad Michael Murray?

180
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,255
I always forget the last one,
though.

181
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:41,854
None of those are right.
He's talking about African game hunting.

182
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:45,649
Anyway, so Jessica and I,
we work together and that's how we met.

183
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:48,819
And then when Derek and Jessica broke up
we really wanted them to stay friends.

184
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:51,080
That way we just,
we didn't break the group up.

185
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:53,115
- That's cool and mature.
- We're a tight group.

186
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,787
We look out for one another.
Isn't that right, guys?

187
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:59,383
We're not an easy group to keep up with,
which is why I gotta hand it to you two.

188
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:01,321
You seem really at ease
in the situation.

189
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:03,876
I'm into sales
so I'm used to meeting new people.

190
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,572
- What's that noise?
- You might call me a people person.

191
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:10,256
In fact, in high school I was voted
most well-liked and king of howdy-day.

192
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:13,150
- Only time it's ever happened.
- Are we on a flight path?

193
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:15,429
You really fooled us.
We would never think

194
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:17,888
that you would be
into extreme stuff.

195
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:19,641
- Extreme stuff?
- Like that?

196
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:22,628
Here we go.

197
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,581
It's all about taking it
to the next level.

198
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,180
- What are the whistles for?
- In case we get lost.

199
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:29,443
Lost?

200
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:36,830
Paddle forward!
Paddle forward!

201
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:38,763
You must be out of your damn mind!

202
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:44,666
- Help me, lord!
- Ask him to help me too!

203
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:49,379
Are those rocks real?

204
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,727
Flex your core.

205
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:07,231
It's the next level.

206
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,854
Jessica's hand is still on my thigh!

207
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,141
Are you okay?

208
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:35,815
Where's Stu?

209
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:44,533
Stu, can you hear us?

210
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:45,858
Where are you?

211
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,148
Psych 411
"Thrill Seekers & Hell Raisers"

212
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,132
Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

213
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,060
Did either of you see when this guy Stu
fell out of the boat?

214
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:45,703
There was so much water pummeling
our face we couldn't see anything.

215
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:48,336
- Mostly consisting of Gus's tears.
- You can't prove that.

216
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:50,334
The truth is,
I found it pretty exhilarating.

217
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:54,188
The only thing I can compare it to is
I found out you could have brownies.

218
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,500
Except in this case,
a human being is missing.

219
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,877
- That part was not cool.
- Damn right it's not.

220
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:01,303
Can you believe they do
this dangerous stuff all the time?

221
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:04,723
They're adrenaline junkies.
People who enjoy extreme activities.

222
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,431
I know what adrenaline junkies are.

223
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:09,571
Am I crazy, but isn't the fact
that Ruby likes to tempt death

224
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,504
for thrills information that should
have been disclosed on the first date?

225
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:15,638
If only you knew someone
who could've vetted that out beforehand.

226
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:19,404
Can I talk to you for a sec?

227
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,246
I should've warned you.
And that I'm into extreme sports.

228
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,446
You should have.

229
00:12:29,571 --> 00:12:31,948
I was just really afraid
that it was gonna freak you out.

230
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:34,336
I mean, some guys get really freaked out
by stuff like that.

231
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:37,964
And I don't know, I'm sure you have too,
especially now with Stu, and...

232
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:40,133
I just really hope he's okay.

233
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,950
Me too.

234
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,472
But the truth is,
none of this scared me off.

235
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:46,827
Really?

236
00:12:50,263 --> 00:12:51,796
May I have a word with you

237
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:54,840
in the "stop saying crazy things
to Ruby" room please?

238
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:56,315
Give us a second.

239
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:00,581
- You said you were gonna break up.
- I changed my mind.

240
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:01,714
- When?
- Now.

241
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,374
Man, she likes to almost die
and so do her friends.

242
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:06,372
It's like we walked
into <i>Final Destination</i>.

243
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:08,578
We walked out of final destination.

244
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,767
Bottom line, she's been vetted.

245
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:14,959
- It's time to push the eject button.
- I'm not ready to do that.

246
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:17,255
Make sure CSI covers
this whole area.

247
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:23,218
- That's Stu's vest.
- What happened? Did you find him?

248
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,170
I'd rather leave that
to the professionals.

249
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,140
It would be inappropriate for me
to speculate at this time.

250
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:29,891
Please, we can handle it.

251
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:33,647
My best guess, the life vest came off
when he fell out of the boat.

252
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,480
He hit his head on a rock
and he drowned.

253
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,109
We'll probably find his body in a gully
or a spillway somewhere down the river.

254
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,964
I just hope that we get to him
before the birds do.

255
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,822
They said they could handle it.

256
00:13:54,654 --> 00:13:56,835
Classy, Lassie, but you're right.

257
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,422
Stu did go overboard. But you're not
gonna find his body in a spillway

258
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:03,842
because he didn't hit his head
and he definitely didn't drown.

259
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,530
So he just what,
turned into a fish and swam away?

260
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:07,804
Don't be ridiculous.

261
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,866
A cat like Stu would never reach
into Costner's bag of tricks.

262
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,358
But I am pretty sure he swam away.

263
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,653
Obviously Stu used the hooks to attach
himself to something in the water.

264
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:28,280
- But why would he do that?
- I'm not entirely sure.

265
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:29,405
Guys.

266
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:33,843
We got news on the missing person.
I just got a call from the diving team.

267
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:35,457
They found high-strength netting

268
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:37,408
on the bottom of a big boulder
in the rapids.

269
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:41,157
Let me tell you how this went down.
Stu knew exactly where to jump.

270
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:44,095
It happened in rough water so that
no one would notice that he was gone.

271
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,657
He waited for the raft to drift around
a bend and he made his way to shore.

272
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:50,473
But I don't get it.
Why would Stu want to make that?

273
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,898
Because of this.

274
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,398
Clearance sale at mattress discounters.
Seems redundant.

275
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:01,723
No, this.

276
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,487
Stu and his business partner
Brian Sampson just filed for bankruptcy.

277
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:08,198
Sampson, that's just a great name.

278
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,908
Straight out of film noir.

279
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:13,352
An old detective who drinks hard
but loves even harder.

280
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:14,917
Or go with me here.

281
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,224
A tiny little orphan mouse who must find
his way home to Wolverhampton.

282
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:22,666
Or Samson the legendary figure
from the Bible.

283
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,732
No, that doesn't work. All those guys
have names like Ben-Hur and Prometheus.

284
00:15:25,857 --> 00:15:27,634
You have never read
the Bible have you?

285
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:29,925
Genesis, exorcist,

286
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,722
leviathan, do the right thing.

287
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,349
- Oh, my gosh.
- Stop talking.

288
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:38,039
We've gotta find this Brian Sampson,

289
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:40,496
because if this is true,
given the complexity of Stu's escape

290
00:15:40,621 --> 00:15:43,075
there is no way
he could've done this by himself.

291
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:44,651
He's right.

292
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:47,487
No, that's Stu's seat.

293
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:50,084
Gus, a word.

294
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:54,241
What?

295
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:55,739
Bad news first.

296
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:58,236
I'm almost positive
Ruby's the one who helped Stu.

297
00:15:58,361 --> 00:16:00,242
But here's the good news,
we can use Ruby,

298
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:02,989
- solve the case, and look like heroes.
- You are unbelievable.

299
00:16:03,114 --> 00:16:04,214
Really unbelievable.

300
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,340
You've convinced yourself
that Ruby is wrong for me

301
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,524
and now you're fishing
for some reason to justify it?

302
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:11,258
Man, I know this is hard to hear
but I'm pretty sure she was involved.

303
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:14,472
The only thing she's involved in,
Shawn, is being awesome.

304
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:18,241
- All right. Maybe I'm wrong.
- Damn right you are.

305
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:21,682
Maybe I'm being overprotective because
the way the Mira thing went down.

306
00:16:22,737 --> 00:16:26,037
I appreciate you looking after me,
but Ruby is not Mira.

307
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,448
- She's guilty to be awesome.
- That's right.

308
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,711
- Have your parents met her?
- No.

309
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:35,655
They're at a time-share pitch
in Chula Vista.

310
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,057
- I'll go with her when they get back.
- In the meantime,

311
00:16:38,182 --> 00:16:39,656
I've got the next best thing.

312
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:43,500
- Where's Chula Vista?
- I don't know. I think they made it up.

313
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:53,303
So my hands are all bloody and blistered
from three hours of fighting

314
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,310
to reel in this marlin,
when all of a sudden

315
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:58,064
I realize that we've drifted
into Cuban waters.

316
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,630
And I know this because one
of their patrol boats proceeds

317
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,634
to blow a hole the size
of a bowling ball in our hull.

318
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,151
- This bourbon packs a wallop.
- Not too strong for you?

319
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:11,237
I'm paying you a compliment.
Not strong enough.

320
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,343
- Try this.
- So what happened next?

321
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:16,409
We turned and we ran for our lives.
We made it, like,

322
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:18,774
around five miles off
the coast of key west

323
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:21,247
before she sank and then we had
to swim the rest of the way.

324
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:25,168
We ended up sitting in with the house
band at sloppy Joe's soaking wet.

325
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:27,910
That is the best damn fish story
I've ever heard.

326
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:30,822
Cheers.

327
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,518
That was my friend, Stu.

328
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:36,346
He planned the whole trip.

329
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:39,891
Look, I'm pretty sure wherever he is
he's okay.

330
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:46,105
I better check on the burgers.

331
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,516
What do you think you're doing?

332
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:59,494
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm making my world-famous burgers.

333
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:03,266
You are supposed to be helping me prove
that Ruby is hiding something.

334
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:05,641
Instead you're swapping
fishing stories with her.

335
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:08,128
And what is that nonsense
about you catching the bluefin tuna?

336
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,832
You found it on the beach
and practically tripped over it.

337
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,966
Come on, Shawn, look.
That's what you do.

338
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,884
It's a fishing story, you embellish.

339
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:17,721
You think you're trying to help Gus.
You usually are.

340
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,089
But in this case, I'm not so sure.

341
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:22,809
Why would you say that?

342
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:26,618
Look, is it possible, just possible,
that your suspicions of Ruby

343
00:18:26,743 --> 00:18:29,915
stem from your jealousy that Gus is
in a healthy, solid relationship

344
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,778
with a great woman, whereas you had one
with an equally great woman

345
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,750
but you let her slip away?

346
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:41,030
How much have you had to drink?

347
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:44,956
More than a little and less than enough.
But I make sense, don't I?

348
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,464
Looks like you're a big hit
with Shawn's dad.

349
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:50,965
Yeah, but the only one
that I can't win over is Shawn.

350
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,965
It's like he doesn't trust me.

351
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,426
He was a little suspicious
about you at first.

352
00:18:57,155 --> 00:18:58,205
Suspicious?

353
00:18:58,878 --> 00:18:59,637
How so?

354
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:03,558
I probably shouldn't tell you.
We'll probably have

355
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,659
a big laugh about this someday.

356
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,955
He had this crazy theory
caught up in his head

357
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,191
about how you helped Stu
orchestrate his disappearance.

358
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:16,529
The cops said that Stu used some kind
of webbing to attach himself to a rock.

359
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:20,199
And Shawn has it caught up in his head
that you helped him orchestrate it.

360
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,109
- Oh, my God.
- What?

361
00:19:22,348 --> 00:19:23,848
He's really psychic.

362
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:27,165
Wait a second, you mean he's right?
You did?

363
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,084
Stu is my best friend in the world.

364
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,253
He just said that he was
in some kind of trouble

365
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,271
and he needed a few days
to figure things out.

366
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,927
Wait, you need to tell the police
about this now.

367
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,603
I can't. Stu begged me
to give him a few days.

368
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:44,098
I'm the only person in the world
that he can trust.

369
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,999
You're the only person that I can trust.
So you know what this means?

370
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:50,270
We're in a trust circle.

371
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,397
No, no,
I want out of the trust circle.

372
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,942
There are no doors.

373
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,367
- What about Shawn?
- That would be a trust triangle.

374
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:58,654
Don't make this more difficult
than it already is.

375
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:00,474
Please, please, please?

376
00:20:00,986 --> 00:20:03,543
You have to promise me
you're not gonna say anything to Shawn.

377
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:04,494
For me?

378
00:20:06,294 --> 00:20:08,330
- I promise.
- Thank you.

379
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,733
Smiths lyric-off.

380
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:15,031
You, me, 10 minutes.

381
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:18,341
I'm gonna wipe the floor with you.
We're starting with the queen is dead.

382
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:19,831
15 minutes.

383
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:27,433
I wanna tell you something.
Will you look at me, please?

384
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,770
I just had a drunken revelation
out there.

385
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,327
It wasn't mine, it was my dad's,
but at this point, I'll take it.

386
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:35,817
I was way off about Ruby,

387
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:37,192
and I admit it.

388
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:40,238
She's amazing.
In fact, I wish we could clone her.

389
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,384
And then maybe the clone
would come off a little slow.

390
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,994
Not like she has special needs,
just like a little bit dim,

391
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,787
and that would be perfect for me.

392
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,901
Truth is,
I think I was just jealous,

393
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:53,001
'cause you have something special
and I haven't heard from Abigail in,

394
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,421
- like, a month or something.
- I appreciate your honesty.

395
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,106
So what were you
and Rubes talking about?

396
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:10,849
- I got your message. What's up?
- We haven't get a hold of Sampson.

397
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:14,019
Great name. Sounds like
one of the dwarf warriors from <i>Willow</i>.

398
00:21:14,144 --> 00:21:16,792
We've been through this already.
Sampson is Stu's partner.

399
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:20,033
We were able to track down Sampson
and Stu's assistant, Charles Lucas.

400
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:21,665
Lassiter has him in room "A"

401
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,331
- Claims he knows nothing.
- You want me to get in and read him,

402
00:21:24,456 --> 00:21:28,104
Because I can always tell when someone
is hiding something. Isn't that right?

403
00:21:28,229 --> 00:21:30,806
Why do you look away when I talk?
You did that all morning.

404
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:32,008
Something in my eye.

405
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:33,649
- What is it?
- Monkey brush.

406
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:34,708
Never heard.

407
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,702
So now you're gonna tell me
Monkey brush doesn't even exist?

408
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:39,492
Don't be the new Meshach Taylor.

409
00:21:39,617 --> 00:21:41,831
I don't know
what you're talking about.

410
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,503
You're not going
to leave this room, Lucas,

411
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:48,473
Until you start
telling me the truth.

412
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,482
Saying "the truth"

413
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:53,026
louder than the previous words
isn't going to work.

414
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:55,661
I've told you the truth.
I don't know anything.

415
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,524
Thanks. We'll take it from here.

416
00:21:58,714 --> 00:22:02,135
Let's get one thing straight, you are
here just to observe this interrogation.

417
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,010
- Understood?
- Absolutely.

418
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:11,305
I've got something.

419
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,164
You were at the river
the day that Stu disappeared.

420
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:16,624
I was there. But only because Stu
asked me

421
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:18,628
to drop him off
and drive his car down river

422
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:22,173
so he wouldn't catch a ride back,
then I called a cab and went home.

423
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:23,679
You're lying.

424
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,440
He's not lying.

425
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:30,348
His lip is completely still, no sweat
on forehead, fingers aren't trembling.

426
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:48,324
- You're hiding something.
- No, I'm not.

427
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:51,035
- I want the truth.
- That is the truth.

428
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,206
- Who are we interrogating?
- Gus, what are you hiding?

429
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,125
I'm not hiding anything.
You're crazy.

430
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,627
- Say he's crazy.
- No, he's hiding something.

431
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:01,170
Let's go.

432
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,759
- Can I leave now?
- Quiet.

433
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,606
- Dude, Ruby said something to you?
- Who?

434
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:12,093
Ruby,
who's only guilty of being awesome.

435
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:15,058
They found a body in the woods.
It's Stu's business partner.

436
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,522
The lovable saint Bernard next door,
and don't realize how big he is.

437
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,315
Looks like an hunting accident.

438
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:24,485
But get this, I found
out that Sampson and Stu

439
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,363
took out million-dollar life insurance
and named each other as beneficiary.

440
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:31,367
- You think Stu killed Brian for money.
- It's motive.

441
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,536
Gus, there's nothing
you'd like to say?

442
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,620
I gotta go.

443
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:47,925
Ruby, I need to talk to you.

444
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,260
Hi, come on up.

445
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,137
Are you nuts? That's dangerous.

446
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,890
I know it seems weird, But this is kind
of our coping mechanism.

447
00:23:55,712 --> 00:23:59,479
Okay, this is getting ridiculous.
Whatever you and Ruby conspired to do

448
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,885
is just as bad.
We're talking about murder here.

449
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,116
- You have to tell me what you know.
- I can't talk to you right now.

450
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:07,211
You kidding me?

451
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:14,298
Dude, this is me.
I am your partner and your best friend.

452
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,161
We are not supposed to keep secrets.

453
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:19,003
- I know, but it's complicated.
- No, math is complicated.

454
00:24:19,128 --> 00:24:20,905
<i>The show it's complicated was
complicated.</i>

455
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,035
<i>The song complicated</i>
by Avril Lavigne,

456
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,921
ironically, not very complicated.

457
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,137
And you know what? Neither is this.

458
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:31,927
I didn't expect to see you here. Look
who's learning to be the aggressive one.

459
00:24:32,098 --> 00:24:33,805
I am not here to see you.

460
00:24:34,051 --> 00:24:35,723
Yeah, and I'm wearing panties.

461
00:24:42,978 --> 00:24:43,996
Listen to me,

462
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:47,278
we have a responsibility to the police.
If you know something and we don't tell,

463
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,485
that's lying.

464
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,160
So should I tell them
you're not really psychic?

465
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:53,281
How did you get from "a" to "b"?

466
00:24:54,443 --> 00:24:56,160
Hey, buddy, what are you doing here?

467
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:59,288
You know,
I'm just chasing after Jessica.

468
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,748
Yeah, don't they all.

469
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:04,676
I don't know if this means anything,
but you would make a great couple.

470
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:06,712
Maybe I should give you my key
to her apartment.

471
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,634
Maybe.

472
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,509
You know, that way, you can get in.

473
00:25:13,427 --> 00:25:14,427
I got it.

474
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,596
I do.

475
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:21,811
- Stop letting Ruby come between us.
- I'm not gonna let that happen.

476
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:24,939
What's going on?

477
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,109
Ruby, I can't do this anymore.
I need to let Shawn in our trust circle.

478
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:30,608
I didn't hear that.

479
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:33,865
Ruby, the police think that Stu
may have killed Brian Sampson.

480
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,408
- Brian's dead?
- Yeah.

481
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:39,786
I know that you helped
stage Stu's disappearance.

482
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,782
Yeah, I know you know that.

483
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:43,833
- Gus told you?
- Of course he did.

484
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:46,710
But Stu...
Stu could've never killed Brian.

485
00:25:46,835 --> 00:25:49,714
- No matter how much Brian deserved it.
- What does that mean?

486
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:52,257
Brian was the reason
that Stu was going broke.

487
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:55,761
He used all of the company's money
to pay for his exorbitant lifestyle.

488
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,556
It's always about money.

489
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:02,852
Tell him everything, Ruby.
We need to know where Stu is.

490
00:26:05,174 --> 00:26:08,015
- Where do you think you're going?
- With you to the police station.

491
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,342
I don't think so.

492
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,861
Now that Ruby's told us Stu is hiding
at Lone Pine, we've to tell the police.

493
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,186
Correction. I have to tell the police.
You have to crawl back

494
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:18,259
under your keeping-secrets
-from-your-best-friend

495
00:26:18,384 --> 00:26:19,904
and apply for residency

496
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:21,679
where you can vote
and pay your taxes

497
00:26:21,804 --> 00:26:23,623
and make little backstabbing
rock babies.

498
00:26:23,801 --> 00:26:25,208
- Have we to do this?
- Yes.

499
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:27,293
I'm questioning your dedication
to this case,

500
00:26:27,634 --> 00:26:30,063
our partnership,
and maybe even America.

501
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:32,193
I'm dedicated.
I take our job seriously.

502
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:35,620
Please, you are so distracted
by Ruby and her boobs

503
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:39,457
and your lies and the heavy petting,
you probably don't remember who's Jason.

504
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,175
- Stu.
- Or who he kidnapped.

505
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,059
He didn't kidnap anyone.
He disappeared.

506
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,393
Right off the top
of a building in Vancouver.

507
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:48,480
- That was a who didn't steal anything.
- And then fell down a mine shaft.

508
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,024
That was us.
Look, give it up, Shawn.

509
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:55,015
My trust circle with Ruby resisted,
I've been paying just as much attention

510
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,040
- to what's been going on as you have.
- You can't have a circle with 2 people.

511
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:01,369
So let's set aside our personal issues
and continue on our investigation.

512
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,615
Please, you wish you had
my acute observational skills.

513
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,999
- You wish you had my focus.
- My attention to detail.

514
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:09,201
Attention to detail, please.

515
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,554
All right, people, listen up.

516
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,143
By piecing together
Stu's credit card activity,

517
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:35,194
phone records, and known
sightings the last three weeks,

518
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,280
we've pinpointed
his location to here:

519
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,073
a small ranch outside of Reno,
Nevada.

520
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,835
We need to coordinate with all state
and local law enforcement agencies.

521
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:50,001
Psychic navigators are saying
something different, Lassie.

522
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,714
- Cut that out before to blind somebody.
- As usual, Lassie, you're way off.

523
00:27:55,352 --> 00:27:58,152
The actual position
where Stu is hiding is...

524
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:01,053
here, right outside of Lone Pine.

525
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,306
And you know this how?

526
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:06,062
Same way I knew that Stu
had fled in the first place.

527
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:07,745
The question is, Lassie,

528
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,023
do you want to mobilize your team
to Nevada and risk humiliating yourself,

529
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,942
or do you wanna mobilize them
to Lone Pine,

530
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,302
which is on the way,
and only risk humiliating me?

531
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,156
Everybody, let's head to Lone Pine.

532
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,399
Stay put, Spencer.

533
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,106
Stu Crawford, it's the SBPD.
We're coming in.

534
00:28:40,231 --> 00:28:43,083
I'm still more than a little peeved
at you for keeping all this from me.

535
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:46,318
I'm sorry, Shawn, but you know,
eventually we're gonna both get married.

536
00:28:46,443 --> 00:28:48,952
There's gonna be certain things
we can't share.

537
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:51,272
I'm trying not to think about that.

538
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:55,401
- We're still gonna live next door.
- With a pool going across our yards.

539
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,851
I've got dibs on the diving board.

540
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:02,239
Why don't you get in there?

541
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,784
Well, you had everything right,
Spencer.

542
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:17,088
He definitely
didn't drown in the river.

543
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,247
I know this must be very hard.

544
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:26,376
But Stu didn't leave a suicide note,
Is there anything that you can tell us?

545
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:30,871
I've known Stu for years,
and none of this makes any sense.

546
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,445
I still can't believe he's gone.

547
00:29:35,537 --> 00:29:37,114
Now, Ruby's already informed us

548
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:39,541
of her involvement
with Stu's disappearance.

549
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:42,363
If either of you two were involved,
now's the time to tell us.

550
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:45,074
They don't know anything about it.

551
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,828
Actually, Stu came to me first
saying that he needed a place to hide.

552
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:52,873
I told himto stop being a coward
and just face his problems like a man.

553
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:56,428
Stu told me that I was
the only person that he trusted.

554
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:00,047
That is so like you to think
you're the special one in the group.

555
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,383
- Everything's about Ruby.
- I need attention?

556
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,511
You're the one that throws herself
at every guy.

557
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,135
Take it back, bitch!

558
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:10,516
- Ladies, simmer down.
- Hold on chief, make her.

559
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,384
Can you... try to make her.

560
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,170
Look, miss Martino,
we know that you've had

561
00:30:16,295 --> 00:30:18,357
some court-appointed
anger management sessions

562
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,861
and a prior for stalking
Stu's business partner Brian Sampson.

563
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:22,987
Oh, that?

564
00:30:23,337 --> 00:30:26,137
Stu introduced us at a party
and we totally hit it off.

565
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,243
And then Brian started
sending me mixed signals.

566
00:30:29,947 --> 00:30:31,233
Mixed signals.

567
00:30:31,358 --> 00:30:33,971
Let's just say
that you're a person of interest

568
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:35,708
and we'd like you to stay in town.

569
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:36,888
Fine.

570
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,676
- Am I free to go too, now?
- Yeah, you too, miss J.

571
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,831
Wait for me outside?

572
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:54,341
The preponderance
of evidence still points

573
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:57,164
to Stu being responsible
for Brian Sampson's murder.

574
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:01,360
In view of the performance we witnessed,
we should re-review said evidence.

575
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,946
You can't re-review something,
It's redundant.

576
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,778
Like re-repeat or re-reflect.

577
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,781
You can if you've peated
and flected twice.

578
00:31:08,221 --> 00:31:10,586
I remind you
that you haven't been hired

579
00:31:10,711 --> 00:31:12,994
on this case,
and what you say doesn't matter?

580
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,147
- We haven't been hired?
- Nobody hired me.

581
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:17,332
We'll call you if we need you.

582
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:26,955
I'm sorry about Stu.

583
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,192
I'm sorry about putting you
in this situation.

584
00:31:29,317 --> 00:31:31,193
You were doing a good thing
for a great friend.

585
00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:34,099
- I can't be mad at that.
- Thank you for understanding.

586
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,469
So now that everything's out
in the open, let's agree.

587
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:41,106
- No more secrets.
- OK, agreed, yes. No more secrets.

588
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,000
- All right.
- All right.

589
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,069
Bottle and weave.

590
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:46,783
- Really?
- Yeah.

591
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:48,423
Divorced.

592
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,791
Baby daddy?

593
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:52,385
- Credit?
- 770.

594
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,452
Not bad.

595
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:57,721
Oh, you guys.

596
00:31:58,404 --> 00:31:59,704
This is so nice.

597
00:31:59,993 --> 00:32:02,069
This feels good.

598
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:05,422
I knew you were special
from the beginning.

599
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,534
You had me
at <i>Did you see the Sunrise: Part two</i>.

600
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:12,528
I'm gonna wait in the car.

601
00:32:12,653 --> 00:32:14,453
- All right.
- All right.

602
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:17,893
I was right about her
from the beginning. She is amazing.

603
00:32:18,018 --> 00:32:20,270
I am 110% on the Ruby train now.

604
00:32:20,395 --> 00:32:24,273
Good, she just lost a dear friend.
She needs us, Gus. We're her rock.

605
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:26,717
- You mean, I'm her rock.
- Yes, you're her rock.

606
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:28,418
- I'm her anchor.
- Stop it.

607
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:30,031
- Stop what?
- You know what.

608
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,706
- That?
- Yes, that.

609
00:32:32,102 --> 00:32:35,119
I only did that 'cause you said stop
doing this. If I stop that, then what?

610
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,328
Stop stopping it.

611
00:32:36,738 --> 00:32:38,560
I think I know what's going on.

612
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:41,076
You feel bad that you were
against Ruby from the beginning

613
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:43,277
so you're trying to overcompensate
by pushing your way

614
00:32:43,402 --> 00:32:44,670
into our relationship.

615
00:32:45,115 --> 00:32:48,299
But I'm not upset, because I know
deep down it's just your way

616
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,427
of saying I have a good thing in Ruby
and you don't wanna see me lose it.

617
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,554
All right, you console your lady.
I'll handle the case for a while.

618
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,079
- The case we didn't get hired on?
- You know how I roll.

619
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:06,621
Hey, old buddy,
raise your hand if you've missed you.

620
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:08,485
Hold on, let me guess.

621
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,279
Police won't let you in on another case.
You want me to help you.

622
00:33:11,449 --> 00:33:13,276
I thought I was the psychic.

623
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:15,151
But I come bearing gifts.

624
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,288
I figured your slender toes must get
a little chilly down here on the block.

625
00:33:20,194 --> 00:33:21,194
They do.

626
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:22,416
Thank you.

627
00:33:22,771 --> 00:33:24,658
All right, what can I do for you?

628
00:33:25,082 --> 00:33:27,047
Is that big Brian Sampson
on the slab?

629
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,964
Handsome dude
got a big ol'hole in his pec.

630
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:32,468
What's the first thing that pops
into your head when I say Sampson?

631
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,001
A vacuum you can use in space.

632
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:36,810
Thank you. What can you tell me?

633
00:33:36,935 --> 00:33:38,981
Even though the bullet
was not found,

634
00:33:39,106 --> 00:33:43,103
in my opinion, it likely came
from a winchester 70 rifle.

635
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,732
Get out of this death igloo. You can
tell that just by looking at the hole?

636
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:49,568
Correct you are, my gelled friend.
Allow me to demonstrate.

637
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:55,927
Of course, watermelon.

638
00:33:56,052 --> 00:33:58,410
- Perfect substitute for the human head.
- Uncanny.

639
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,621
Porterhouse
simulates the human thigh.

640
00:34:02,516 --> 00:34:04,509
The maple wood simulates oak wood.

641
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,087
This is all academic
unless we can find the murder weapon.

642
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,799
Believe me, you've helped
more than you could possibly know.

643
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:13,953
Worces... ter.

644
00:34:14,843 --> 00:34:16,678
- The sauce?
- Doesn't make any sense.

645
00:34:16,803 --> 00:34:18,179
- Westchester.
- The county?

646
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:20,099
Counties can't kill people, Jules.

647
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,267
Win....

648
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,143
Win?

649
00:34:24,153 --> 00:34:25,312
- Chester!
- Yes!

650
00:34:25,956 --> 00:34:27,712
- 69...
- 70.

651
00:34:28,292 --> 00:34:30,425
Jessica Martino
owns a winchester 70.

652
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:33,373
That is a very good link
to the murder of Brian Sampson.

653
00:34:33,498 --> 00:34:35,447
Let's pay miss Martino
a little visit, shall we?

654
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,890
I'll call Gus,
tell to stay away from Jessica.

655
00:34:40,282 --> 00:34:42,204
- What's up.
- Stay away from Jessica.

656
00:34:42,793 --> 00:34:44,248
You hooked up with her?

657
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,375
What does that mean?
No, she might be the murderer.

658
00:34:46,864 --> 00:34:47,710
What?

659
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:50,003
- Make sure you don't go near her.
- <i>Don't worry.</i>

660
00:34:50,184 --> 00:34:53,318
Ruby's fine. She had to clear her head,
so she and Derek went paragliding.

661
00:34:53,443 --> 00:34:56,093
- You know, that's how they cope.
- Of course it is.

662
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:02,663
This was a great idea, Derek.

663
00:35:02,788 --> 00:35:05,091
Things have just been
so out of control this week.

664
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:07,452
I needed something
to take my mind off of Stu.

665
00:35:07,577 --> 00:35:08,627
No problem.

666
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,188
We're gonna glide down the valley
and then hike back up.

667
00:35:12,313 --> 00:35:15,496
I'm just gonna put our coordinates in
so we take the shortest path.

668
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:17,615
Who do you know in Lone Pine?

669
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,534
You know, that's the area
that I told Stu about. How did...

670
00:35:24,481 --> 00:35:25,531
It was you.

671
00:35:28,352 --> 00:35:29,602
There's no way.

672
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,712
I really wish you hadn't seen that.

673
00:35:38,772 --> 00:35:41,263
That was Jules. They found the rifle
in Jessica's apartment.

674
00:35:41,981 --> 00:35:44,627
- They're booking Jessica now.
- Man, she was crazy.

675
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:46,560
Glad we found out now
before you hooked up.

676
00:35:46,873 --> 00:35:48,712
When was I ever gonna
hook up with Jessica?

677
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,773
Shawn,
please, you know honey was fly.

678
00:35:50,964 --> 00:35:52,917
She's a murderer, Gus.
Plus, it was creepy.

679
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:55,576
She stalks Brian, she dates Derek.

680
00:35:55,855 --> 00:35:57,145
- She was hot.
- I know.

681
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,770
- With legs I could've climbed.
- What?

682
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,330
<i>I don't know if it means anything,
but you guys would make a great couple.</i>

683
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:06,997
<i>Maybe I should give you
my key to her apartment.</i>

684
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,483
<i>Which is ironic
because Derek used to be</i>

685
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:11,627
<i>a big game hunter back
when he was dating Jessica.</i>

686
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,203
<i>We're a tight-knit group.</i>

687
00:36:14,328 --> 00:36:17,089
<i>We look out for our own.
Isn't that right, guys?</i>

688
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:20,875
- What?
- Ruby's in danger.

689
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,388
- I'll explain on the way.
- I just put my car in the shop.

690
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:26,242
Hold on tight.

691
00:36:29,174 --> 00:36:31,230
I can't even process this, Derek.

692
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,649
Stu was our friend.
How could you kill him?

693
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:37,402
Friend? Stu didn't understand
the meaning of true friendship.

694
00:36:37,636 --> 00:36:39,487
True friends stand
behind one another.

695
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:42,333
- See, Stu and I had a pact.
- All right.

696
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,750
I would make
Brian pay for what he did

697
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:47,485
and then I was gonna let Stu
cash in on the insurance policy.

698
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,706
- Right.
- And I held up my end.

699
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:52,751
But Stu decided to get a conscience.

700
00:36:55,939 --> 00:36:57,039
Why don't...

701
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:02,259
Why don't you and I just make
a pact right now?

702
00:37:02,384 --> 00:37:05,084
A pact that neither of us
is gonna kill me.

703
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:09,742
You have no idea

704
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:14,147
the adrenaline rush you get
when you track down and kill a man.

705
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,015
It's like lightning
running down your spine.

706
00:37:17,412 --> 00:37:18,777
None of this stuff compares.

707
00:37:21,045 --> 00:37:23,240
I always sensed that you were
the strongest of the group.

708
00:37:23,995 --> 00:37:26,535
And I envied Jessica
that she got to be with you.

709
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,151
You know that?

710
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:30,414
Please don't insult my intelligence.

711
00:37:30,979 --> 00:37:32,629
Fine, but I had to try.

712
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:35,544
You're a douche bag, and quite frankly,
as dumb as a wildebeest.

713
00:37:37,247 --> 00:37:40,027
- Sorry it had to end this way.
- No, Derek! Please, no!

714
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,140
- Step away from my lady.
- Please!

715
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:45,137
Don't move. One step and she's gone.

716
00:37:45,607 --> 00:37:47,431
It's all about taking it
to the next level.

717
00:37:47,736 --> 00:37:48,974
Isn't that right, D?

718
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,433
I can see everything.

719
00:37:51,024 --> 00:37:54,040
<i>You killed Brian Sampson
because he ruined Stu.</i>

720
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:59,109
<i>Then you proudly told Stu
you did it.</i>

721
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,528
<i>But instead of thanking you,
he totally freaked out.</i>

722
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,087
Because he wasn't crazy.

723
00:38:03,212 --> 00:38:06,651
You knew it was only a matter of time
before he went to the authorities.

724
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:09,163
<i>So you used your key
to get into Jessica's place</i>

725
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:12,665
to take back the rifle you gave her
from your big game hunting days.

726
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,124
- You done?
- Yeah.

727
00:38:14,828 --> 00:38:18,128
Finally, you tracked down
your buddy like a desert fox,

728
00:38:18,657 --> 00:38:20,505
and killed him,
making it look like a suicide.

729
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,009
Thus, pinning the murder
of Brian Sampson on Stu.

730
00:38:36,094 --> 00:38:37,814
Freeze! SBPD!

731
00:38:39,078 --> 00:38:40,484
You're not going anywhere.

732
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,590
- I got him, Shawn.
- Get off me.

733
00:38:46,043 --> 00:38:47,908
- Save me!
- Hang on tight.

734
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,244
- Come on.
- Don't let go.

735
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,288
We'll see you at the bottom.

736
00:38:56,417 --> 00:39:00,212
- He's going south. Cover all clearings.
- Back up, move south to open field.

737
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,131
- He's not even hooked in.
- Don't worry, when Gus is scared,

738
00:39:03,323 --> 00:39:06,700
- he can cling like a drowning cat.
- Don't let me die, Shawn!

739
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,656
- There!
- Thank you, lord.

740
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,563
Dude, that was amazing!

741
00:39:30,688 --> 00:39:32,869
You manhandled a killer
and took him to the ground.

742
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:35,038
It was nothing.
A man protects his lady.

743
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,415
You're so brave.

744
00:39:41,682 --> 00:39:43,338
I'm your rock. I'm your island.

745
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,573
- I know.
- How do you get this damn thing off?

746
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,839
Here let me help you.
You untwist this.

747
00:39:48,964 --> 00:39:50,078
You all right?

748
00:39:50,203 --> 00:39:52,349
- What really happened?
- I squeezed him so tight,

749
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,307
- he passed out by accident.
- Nice.

750
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,513
And my helmet smashed into his chin.

751
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,121
Okay, we're gonna say
that you muscled up his back

752
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:00,897
and then you put him
in a sleeper hold.

753
00:40:01,195 --> 00:40:02,065
Sounds good.

754
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,049
Next level's gonna be dope.

755
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:14,714
Ruby's home safe and sound.

756
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:15,939
There he is.

757
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:19,791
I gotta say,
that was awfully boyfriend-y of you,

758
00:40:20,524 --> 00:40:23,270
Jumping out there risking
death like that to save Ruby.

759
00:40:23,395 --> 00:40:25,111
She is lucky to have you, dude.

760
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:27,799
And I mean just you, all you,
nothing but the you.

761
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,302
You know.
We're gonna take a breather for a while.

762
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,845
- We are?
- Yeah.

763
00:40:32,068 --> 00:40:34,156
I mean, as you know
our relationship started off

764
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:37,017
a lot more action-packed
and exciting than most.

765
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,603
You mean, with people disappearing,
dying, and being arrested?

766
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,064
Yeah, and a lot of heavy foods.

767
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:44,888
So you two have decided
to take a step back

768
00:40:45,013 --> 00:40:46,984
and evaluate
if the attraction is real?

769
00:40:47,735 --> 00:40:49,596
And then
when everything gets back to normal,

770
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:52,491
if the feelings are still there,
we'll start seeing each other again.

771
00:40:53,665 --> 00:40:56,328
He's all grown up.
Making grown-up decisions.

772
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:03,304
- It was her idea, wasn't it?
- Of course it was. I was begging.

773
00:41:07,106 --> 00:41:09,106
I did some soul searching too.

774
00:41:09,806 --> 00:41:12,327
What if we had
to go on the lam like Stu,

775
00:41:12,452 --> 00:41:15,802
and we ended up in the sierras
or someplace way far away

776
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:19,680
from civilization,
with no cell phones, and no water,

777
00:41:19,933 --> 00:41:23,075
it was just us, and we're lost
never to be heard from again?

778
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,216
- That would suck.
- It sure would.

779
00:41:25,341 --> 00:41:27,191
So then I started thinking,

780
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:28,647
if that's us...

781
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:31,406
Death and starvation are imminent...

782
00:41:32,795 --> 00:41:35,634
How long would you want me
to wait before I ate you?

783
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:39,151
I won't dignify that with an answer.

784
00:41:40,422 --> 00:41:42,241
It's a perfectly
reasonable question.

785
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,626
- It's like having a living will.
- No one plans for that.

786
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:48,295
Tell Gus it's normal for friends
to discuss when they'd like to be eaten

787
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,590
in the event of a tragic
alive-esque scenario?

788
00:41:53,274 --> 00:41:55,383
Believe it or not,
I'm with Spencer on this one.

789
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:57,736
I would eat the three of you
in the following order:

790
00:41:57,861 --> 00:41:59,811
O'Hara, Guster, then Spencer.

791
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,811
I've also made a list of whose organs
I'd prefer if I need a transplant.

792
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:06,062
And I've planned for the contingency
where I'm the last man on earth

793
00:42:06,187 --> 00:42:07,602
and I need to choose one person

794
00:42:07,727 --> 00:42:10,152
from the department
with whom to procreate.

795
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,820
Don't worry.
None of you made the list.
