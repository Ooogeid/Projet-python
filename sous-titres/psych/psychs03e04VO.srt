1
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:10,949
Don't say a word.

2
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:21,496
- Fergulous.
- Shawn, I said no words.

3
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:22,928
I see how works.

4
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:25,674
Two weeks ago playing Scrabble
is not a word and actually...

5
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:28,273
It's a word
because it's convenient for you.

6
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:29,899
Oh, buddy.

7
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:33,795
Dude, you've got some peat moss
jammed behind your ear.

8
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:35,697
It could be infected with MAIDS.

9
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:37,206
MAIDS.

10
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,709
I lost a 200$ shoe.

11
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:43,769
Your dad almost got a skull fracture.
You're the one who got us into this.

12
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:46,616
- And nothing happened to you.
- Dudes, stop it.

13
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,395
I've been in the other side of
this table a thousand times.

14
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:51,541
You'll tell them only
what they need to know.

15
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:54,313
- What we'll say about Uncle Jack?
- He's not here. Is he, Shawn?

16
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:55,941
What about take care of ourselves?

17
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:59,323
We didn't do anything wrong.
We didn't break any laws.

18
00:01:01,825 --> 00:01:03,099
Oh no.

19
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:04,530
Oh no, what?

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,651
- What did you do, Shawn?
- Nothing.

21
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:09,035
It's just the laws keep changing.

22
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:11,241
It's getting very challenges
to keep up with the move.

23
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:13,003
Do you know, for instance...

24
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:15,863
There is it now illegal
pretend to be other person?

25
00:01:16,394 --> 00:01:20,269
Shawn. Did you
or did you not break any laws?

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,417
We impersonated priests.

27
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:24,169
What? We were professors.

28
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,797
We were priests, Shawn.

29
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:29,212
You, gentlemen, have
a lot of explaining to do.

30
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:31,344
You can bet sure I'm getting
to the bottom of this.

31
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:33,095
Do I get a phone call or something?

32
00:01:33,256 --> 00:01:35,055
How about a text message?
I'll be quick.

33
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:37,678
I just need to respond, "OMG, LOL.”

34
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:38,896
Here's a question.

35
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,812
How do you make the face that's winking
with the tongue coming out one side?

36
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:43,916
Mr. Spencer, now, by my estimation,

37
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:45,864
you may be in
some serious trouble here.

38
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,815
So I am only going
to ask you this once.

39
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:50,654
Where's the gold?

40
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:54,282
It's not quite as simple as that.

41
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:56,581
Right, if we were to really
answer that question,

42
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,245
we'd have to go back quite a while.

43
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:00,600
How long?

44
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,832
About 20 years.

45
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:08,161
As the rain thundered down
from the dark night sky

46
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,839
and 30-foot waves
crashed over his ship,

47
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,954
the great pirate Bouchard

48
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:16,973
stood on his bow...

49
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:19,707
Pointed...

50
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:22,402
At the California coast,
and yelled,

51
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:26,557
"we shall take this land
as ours, men!"

52
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,895
Your dad's awesome.

53
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:32,136
I know.

54
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:33,880
I'm so glad my dad didn't come.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,346
I mean, I don't even know

56
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:38,456
what a manager of debt
consolidation does, anyways.

57
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,995
Except drink.

58
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:41,706
Rumor has it that

59
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:45,107
Bouchard was obsessed

60
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,441
with searching for Spanish gold.

61
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:53,817
They also say
he may have had syphilis

62
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:56,090
and went crazy
searching for something

63
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,619
that never existed.

64
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,538
But I say...

65
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:04,340
The gold did exist!

66
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,838
Okay, my dad has to go now.

67
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,468
Thanks, dad. See you later. Bye.

68
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:17,727
Wh... Wh... What the heck's
going on here?

69
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:20,615
Officer, we're just
in the middle of a class.

70
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:22,251
Is there a problem with something?

71
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:23,997
Yes, there is a problem.

72
00:03:24,315 --> 00:03:27,927
That's not Shawn's dad, 'cause
I'm Shawn Spencer's father.

73
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:29,545
You're not Shawn's dad?

74
00:03:29,858 --> 00:03:31,753
You know technically.

75
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:34,050
Technically,
that is my brother Jack,

76
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:36,265
who technically didn't tell
me he was coming to town

77
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:38,512
and obviously cooked
up this ruse with Shawn

78
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:41,500
to fool his new teacher.

79
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:42,948
What were you thinking?

80
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:46,078
I don't know. I just thought
it'd be cooler if uncle Jack spoke.

81
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,668
Look, class, I'm sorry
to break this to you, but...

82
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,184
He's not a real
treasure hunter, and this...

83
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:55,528
Is not real gold.

84
00:03:57,285 --> 00:04:00,459
Kids, my big brother
Henry is absolutely right.

85
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:04,155
This is not real gold.

86
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:07,991
But it is real chocolate!

87
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:12,695
What does this have to do
with the gold?

88
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:15,328
Relax, Lassidophilus,
we're getting there.

89
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:16,757
Last night...

90
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:18,804
What can I say?
The movie didn't make any sense.

91
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:21,582
Of course it didn't make any sense
to you. You came in 20 minutes late,

92
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:24,097
fell asleep for an hour, then woke up
and asked me what happened.

93
00:04:24,217 --> 00:04:25,267
You always do this.

94
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:28,085
What can I say? The movie theater's
too damn dark. It makes me sleepy.

95
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:30,256
So basically I paid $10
for you to take a nap.

96
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:31,606
Basically, I paid...

97
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,574
Dad, someone's in the house.

98
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:40,243
Oh, my god. Let's call the cops.

99
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,265
We should call the cops.

100
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,326
You keep a stun gun
in the birdhouse?

101
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:50,281
What's under
the garden gnome, an M-80?

102
00:04:52,547 --> 00:04:55,339
You want me to pok you
in the eyes on the roof?

103
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:01,897
We're calling the cops, right?

104
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:06,942
Why aren't we calling the cops?

105
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,957
Dad, wait.

106
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,240
Stop!

107
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:36,077
Uncle Jack!

108
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,707
I knew it was you
as soon as I saw the penny.

109
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:41,002
Ha ha ha! The kid!

110
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:42,328
Shawn, my boy.

111
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,679
And by the way,
that's a'59 penny.

112
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,046
It's the first year they used
the Lincoln memorial on it.

113
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,190
- I want you to keep it.
- Thanks, man.

114
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:51,936
Jack?

115
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:54,564
Dude. A hose? What were you gonna do,
give him a high colonic?

116
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:56,442
- Shut up, Shawn.
- No, no. I get it.

117
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,880
You bust in here,
you blind him with water,

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,476
and then you make your move, baby.
Come here, you!

119
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:03,059
Oh, boy.

120
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:05,237
It seems like only yesterday
I was bringing you kids

121
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:07,201
to the track,
and we were betting the ponies.

122
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:09,677
I was the only 8-year-old kid
who knew what a trifecta meant.

123
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:11,647
- Yeah.
- Uncle Jack, I haven't heard from you

124
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:15,038
since you sent that e-mail from
Prince Albert's boat in the Maldives.

125
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:18,136
Yeah, well, I had to sign a
confidentiality agreement there, guys.

126
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:19,698
Can't really talk about it.

127
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:21,931
By the way,
I got presents for everybody.

128
00:06:24,646 --> 00:06:28,264
I got these when I was
excavating near Machu Picchu.

129
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:32,055
Dug them up myself.

130
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:36,798
It's been three years, Jack.

131
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:39,233
What are you doing here
besides breaking into my house?

132
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:40,902
Breaking in.
You gave me a key.

133
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:43,855
I didn't give you a key. I don't give
anyone keys, not even Shawn.

134
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:46,551
That's not true. I actually
made a copy a while back.

135
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:49,213
It was when I was hooked
on Wow Wow Wubbzy! On Noggin.

136
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:50,827
I didn't have cable.

137
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:52,317
I also stole your toilet paper

138
00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:54,392
for about a year,
and a huge box of sporks.

139
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:58,519
I guess you are wondering
why I came back.

140
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,693
I want you to help me find
Bouchard's treasure.

141
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:06,761
Come on. Not that again, Jack.

142
00:07:06,922 --> 00:07:08,690
I hate to break it to you,
little brother,

143
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,638
but Bouchard's treasure
does not, has not,

144
00:07:11,758 --> 00:07:14,936
and will not ever exist.
It's a pipe dream.

145
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:17,514
Don't listen to him, uncle Jack.
He's a dream killer.

146
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:19,819
Ah, I understand his frustration.

147
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,216
All those years spent
listening to me drone on

148
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:23,939
about the whole "treasure" thing

149
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:26,230
without even a semblance of proof.

150
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:28,220
I get it.

151
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,561
One thing confuses me, though.

152
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,812
If it is just a figment
of my imagination...

153
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:39,794
Where'd I get this?

154
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,552
Psych 304: The Greatest Adventure
in the History of Basic Cable

155
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:56,962
Synchro : Flolo, Icefre@k

156
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:01,371
For SeriesSub.com

157
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:12,962
Why do I feel like he can see us?

158
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:21,328
No, it's impossible.
He can't see or hear a thing.

159
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:27,673
That's just weird.

160
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:30,962
So, what, we're just gonna let
this guy listens in on everything?

161
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:32,597
It's out of our hands, detective.

162
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,057
Now just get in there and
get to the bottom of this.

163
00:08:35,268 --> 00:08:36,267
You got it.

164
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,952
When are we gonna find out the
deal with suit guy in there?

165
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:46,228
Let's just get back to the story.

166
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:52,742
I can't believe your uncle Jack
actually had a treasure map.

167
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:55,202
I can't believe you actually
pretended your uncle was your dad.

168
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:56,869
I wanted Gus' dad to do it,

169
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:59,304
but there was a genealogy
issue I just couldn't resolve.

170
00:08:59,424 --> 00:09:02,918
- What else can you tell about Bouchard?
- We could only remember bits and pieces

171
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,020
of the Bouchard myth, but Jack...
filled us in on the rest.

172
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,424
November, 1818.

173
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:11,885
Bouchard sailed up and down
the California coast,

174
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:15,528
searching desperately
for the mythical Spanish gold.

175
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,114
He ravaged and looted
the mission in Monterrey,

176
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,240
was repelled
at san Juan Capistrano,

177
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,771
and finally made land here,
at Santa Barbara,

178
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:25,953
where he did battle with a small
Spanish garrison

179
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:27,651
and the Chumash Indians.

180
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:30,320
Yeah, I remember reading
about that.

181
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,791
They say he made off with
millions in Spanish gold coins,

182
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:34,783
but his boat sunk off the coast
north of here.

183
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:37,453
He disappeared, and years later
he showed up in Argentina.

184
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:40,306
Superior retention of
historic detail, Gus.

185
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:44,225
Bouchard was also fond
of hiding clues

186
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:46,078
to the treasure's whereabouts
in the map.

187
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:49,003
And I stumbled upon this one
while researching him in Argentina.

188
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:52,426
First you say you're
in Machu Picchu in Peru,

189
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,745
and all of a sudden,
now you're in Argentina.

190
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:57,347
- So which one is it?
- Dad, he's not a suspect.

191
00:09:57,774 --> 00:09:59,183
He's suspect, all right.

192
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:01,079
Forget him. Forget him, okay?

193
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:03,471
My big brother's always been
just a little cynical.

194
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:05,271
And that's what I love about him.

195
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:07,350
You still haven't answered
my question.

196
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:10,960
What about it, boys?

197
00:10:11,148 --> 00:10:13,155
- Want to be treasure hunters?
- You're kidding me?

198
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:15,240
That's like asking me
if I want my own jet pack

199
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:17,712
or if I've ever wanted
to be a koala bear.

200
00:10:17,905 --> 00:10:20,126
Okay, I think he means,
yes, you can count him in.

201
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:22,228
And me too.

202
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:24,291
Superb. Mm.

203
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:29,162
You know, I've been, reading a
lot about that detective stuff you do,

204
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,841
and it seems to me that having a psychic
might be a real asset.

205
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:35,933
- Who knew I had one in my own family?
- Well, uncle Jack, I...

206
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:37,941
I don't know. I'm not really...

207
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:39,806
I wouldn't necessarily say psychic.

208
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:42,618
Stop that right now.

209
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:44,597
Don't you do that
to yourself, young man.

210
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:46,396
Do not sell yourself short.

211
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:49,081
Do not feel embarrassed
just 'cause you're a little different.

212
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:52,201
Didn't I always tell you
you'd be great? Didn't I?

213
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:53,695
Yeah, you did.

214
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,501
Okay, now, here's the plan.

215
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,408
Everything we find, we split 50/50.

216
00:10:58,584 --> 00:11:01,870
That's after we donate most
of it to a museum, right?

217
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:05,477
- We are so gonna do that, Gus.
- Right.

218
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:08,737
You and I...
We're really, up here, in synch.

219
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:10,880
Okay, so the first thing
we need to do is...

220
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,849
Get matching fedoras?

221
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:14,132
"Get matching fedoras?"

222
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:16,094
You wanted the fedoras, not me.

223
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:17,466
Stop changing the story.

224
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:20,389
My mistake. He wanted
the yellow gauchos. I said no to that.

225
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,872
Would you please put me in a
separate room from these idiots?

226
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:25,395
- I will tell you everything.
- Just continue.

227
00:11:25,555 --> 00:11:27,898
Jack had told us to meet him at
the front steps of the mission,

228
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:29,941
because that was the
first step on the map.

229
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:33,350
Gus and I could barely contain
our excitement.

230
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,647
I contained mine a little better.

231
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:40,278
Okay, just follow my lead.

232
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,440
Say yes to everything.

233
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:48,875
Welcome, welcome...
I'm Karen Raven,

234
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:51,166
head of the Santa Barbara
historical society.

235
00:11:51,286 --> 00:11:53,623
We are delighted to have
such a distinguished professor

236
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:55,073
as yourself visiting us.

237
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:57,373
Ah, gracias, gracias.

238
00:11:57,993 --> 00:12:01,389
I am Abner Espinoza, and these
are my compatriots,

239
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:04,901
Ernesto Agapito Garces con y a de Abelar

240
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:07,347
and Juan Priestly.

241
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,106
Now I see where you
got the priest thing.

242
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,192
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

243
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:17,269
Well, welcome.

244
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:20,050
Please, come this way.

245
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:25,830
Now, as you know, most of
our prized collection pieces

246
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,169
are kept away from the public,
but, we're happy to open our doors

247
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,598
for visiting dignitaries
such as yourselves.

248
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:32,627
Yes.

249
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:35,127
Okay, then.

250
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:38,156
Um, take as much time as you need.

251
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:41,934
And, bill here
will be waiting just outside.

252
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:47,558
All right, boys, we got about 10 minutes
before the real Espinoza shows up.

253
00:12:47,678 --> 00:12:49,794
There's a real Espinoza?

254
00:12:49,914 --> 00:12:52,814
Well, technically speaking,
we used to be partners.

255
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,489
He's a great guy,
but we had a little falling out

256
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,160
when I had a small dalliance
with his wife...

257
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,367
And his sister...

258
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,117
And his housekeeper Debbie.

259
00:13:01,237 --> 00:13:03,745
Uncle Jack,
what's really going on here?

260
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:07,482
My research has told me
there are clues

261
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:10,614
about the treasure's whereabouts
hidden somewhere in this room.

262
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:13,688
And it all has to do
with the number 152.

263
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:16,533
Why don't we just use the map?

264
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,906
Well, technically, there's...

265
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:23,629
Something I haven't told
you about the whole map.

266
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:29,142
Uncle Jack, this is a pretty
big thing to leave out.

267
00:13:29,347 --> 00:13:32,145
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
It's a long story...

268
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:34,689
A one-legged woman,
bottle of Cutty Sark.

269
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:37,218
The point is that
the missing part of the map

270
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:39,805
is the first step of the hunt.

271
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:42,823
Now, come on, kid,
use that psychic gift you got.

272
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:45,011
Come on.

273
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:00,179
Oh, boy.

274
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,747
I'm seeing letters swarming.

275
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:05,378
They're... They're zinging.
They're... They're forming...

276
00:14:05,498 --> 00:14:06,833
They're forming words.

277
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:09,404
- "couleur. "
- C- couleur.

278
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:10,475
- Couleur.

279
00:14:10,636 --> 00:14:13,311
- What does that mean?
- Couleur.

280
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,265
French, color...

281
00:14:16,637 --> 00:14:17,860
Paint! Painting!

282
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,993
That's it. Come on, let's go.
Hurry up, more.

283
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:22,021
There are paintings over there.

284
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:35,792
Wait. Go back. Go back.

285
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,835
Hello, Bouchard.

286
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:45,301
Let me see the map.

287
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:52,033
Where did you hide
that clue, you old syphilitic sea dog?

288
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:03,693
I know where the map starts.

289
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:09,913
And I know where the first clue is.

290
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:23,881
Wait. The map was actually real?

291
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:26,050
We couldn't believe it.

292
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:28,863
The lighthouse was the first clue.
What happened from there?

293
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:30,972
- We didn't make it to the second clue.
- Why not?

294
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:34,288
Because we weren't
the only ones who found the lighthouse.

295
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:51,656
All right, Spencer,
tell the chief what you just told us.

296
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:53,445
Okay, chief, here it goes.

297
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:55,258
We're so hungry.

298
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:58,476
I can't get the burrito place
on Cota street out of my mind.

299
00:15:58,596 --> 00:16:01,144
They're open late.
Gus, children's burrito, no sauce.

300
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:03,200
Dad, I know you're a fan
of the carne asada.

301
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,666
All right, Mr. Spencer,
let me be frank.

302
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:07,659
As long as I can be Dean
and Gus Sammy.

303
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:09,511
- Why do I have to be Sammy?
- He's Sammy.

304
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:11,095
That makes you Joey Bishop.

305
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:13,515
Is that what you really want?
You want to be Joey Bishop?

306
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:17,351
I'm sorry, Jules. How often does someone
set you up with "let me be Frank"?

307
00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:21,063
Don't forget that you are
in a lot of trouble here.

308
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:23,858
And I am probably the only person
in this room who cares

309
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,526
to see you get out of it.

310
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:28,520
Now, it's 2:30 in the morning.
We've been here for hours.

311
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,359
Enough with the jokes,
stop delaying,

312
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,057
and tell us what we want to hear!

313
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,239
My god. That was so hot.

314
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,764
Spencer, tell the chief what
you told us about the guys

315
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:41,968
who chased you away from
the lighthouse with the guns.

316
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:44,045
Not just chasing us,
they found us...

317
00:16:44,576 --> 00:16:46,423
- Hiding in a cabin.
- Who were they?

318
00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:48,675
Jack's partners.

319
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:52,586
'cause the one thing that you could
count on with my brother Jackie,

320
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:55,370
he always had partners.

321
00:16:57,945 --> 00:17:01,034
Jack, what the hell are you doing?

322
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,438
Mark, calm down, will ya?

323
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:05,734
- It's all part of the plan.
- Wait a sec. You guys know each other?

324
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:06,969
Oh, yeah.

325
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,402
We were partners.

326
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:09,843
I thought We were partners.

327
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,983
Technically,
you're all my partners.

328
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:14,146
I don't know where you
guys went to partner college,

329
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,870
but I'm pretty sure you're not
supposed to shoot at your partners.

330
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,517
Should partners do this?

331
00:17:19,824 --> 00:17:21,819
Maybe we shouldn't use the
word "partners" anymore.

332
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:23,298
It seems to make him mad.

333
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:25,912
Mark.

334
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,043
Kitten, listen.

335
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:31,387
This is my nephew Shawn, okay?

336
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:33,097
He's psychic, for real.

337
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:36,048
Works with the cops sometimes,
fully legitimate... Fully.

338
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:39,767
I brought him to help with the hunt.
I was just gonna pay him a finder's fee.

339
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,032
Finder's fee?

340
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:43,243
- Is that like 50%?
- Not even close.

341
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:46,056
No. Not buying it.

342
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:47,566
You were gonna sell us out.

343
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:49,945
Psychic things
are happening to me!

344
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:52,321
Running down my legs.

345
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:57,632
Welcome, welcome. I'm Karen Raven,

346
00:17:57,752 --> 00:18:00,663
head of the Santa Barbara
historical society.

347
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,333
SAINT GERARD MAJELLA
PATRON SAINT OF PEGNANT WOMEN

348
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,709
You...
Don't worry about the pregnancy.

349
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:08,830
Your girlfriend's
gonna be just fine.

350
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:14,134
What did I tell you?
Now, why don't you just let us go?

351
00:18:14,295 --> 00:18:15,636
We'll all find the treasure.

352
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:19,306
We'll be stinking, filthy
rich, and live fabulous lives.

353
00:18:19,468 --> 00:18:20,506
No.

354
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:21,684
Give us the map.

355
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,594
We don't have the map.

356
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:24,562
Really?

357
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:26,376
That's too bad.

358
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:28,600
Okay, it's in the backpack.

359
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:31,887
Thanks.

360
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:40,911
It's in... It's in
the side pouch. Ssh!

361
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:48,613
Should we tell Mark
that there's a tear in the map?

362
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:54,475
Son of a bitch, Jack!

363
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:55,524
Hold it.

364
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:58,053
So you just gave them the map
and told them everything?

365
00:18:58,216 --> 00:19:00,432
No, not everything.

366
00:19:00,552 --> 00:19:01,807
Okay, everything.

367
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:03,434
So they found the treasure?

368
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:05,169
Not exactly.

369
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:16,260
Okay, I may...

370
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,120
have psychically led
them down the wrong path.

371
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,407
The spirit world is just one
of life's little mysteries,

372
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,620
like why the Oxygen Network
airs Goodfellas,

373
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:25,946
or why fools fall in love.

374
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,897
Here you go, Mr. Guster.

375
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:30,249
This is all they had in
lost-and-found in your size.

376
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:32,880
An UGG boot?
I can't wear an UGG boot with...

377
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,983
It'll be dope with my one puma.

378
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:37,794
Now, Mr. Spencer.

379
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:38,914
- Yes.
- Yes.

380
00:19:39,092 --> 00:19:40,672
I meant the older...

381
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:42,931
- Sorry, not old, less...
- Handsome.

382
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:45,399
Less hair?
Less friends on facebook?

383
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,519
Less nose.

384
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:48,204
Henry.

385
00:19:48,324 --> 00:19:50,564
Did you fill out a burglary
report on your house yesterday?

386
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:51,744
I did.

387
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,233
But nothing was taken.

388
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:57,029
And yet why do I feel this somehow
plays into this whole mess, doesn't it?

389
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,737
I was the one who picked them up.

390
00:19:59,857 --> 00:20:01,025
Wait, wait, wait.

391
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:03,222
How did your dad know where to find you

392
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:05,530
if that Mark guy took
all your cell phones?

393
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,817
That is a good question.

394
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:12,031
I have to pee.

395
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:13,621
No. No way, Shawn.

396
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:15,964
- What am I supposed to do?
- Hold it like a man.

397
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,133
- I'll get a urinary tract infection.
- Like a man.

398
00:20:18,294 --> 00:20:20,553
You know what? You can link
your legs underneath your chairs

399
00:20:20,673 --> 00:20:22,422
and form a wheel
and roll to the bathroom.

400
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,620
I don't even want to project
how that's gonna happen.

401
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,059
I'm not rolling anywhere.

402
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:28,104
I don't know why I listen
to either one of you.

403
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:31,233
No one is gonna find us.
We're probably gonna die out here.

404
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:33,858
- Gus?
- What?

405
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:35,277
What is that on your leg?

406
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,578
Nothing.

407
00:20:38,698 --> 00:20:40,775
Dude, you are strapped
with another cell phone?

408
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:42,326
Just call Henry. Come on.

409
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:44,826
No, we're not calling anyone.
That is my work phone, for work.

410
00:20:45,002 --> 00:20:47,803
- This is work.
- My boss is watching everything I do.

411
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:50,541
Plus, you used up half my minutes
waiting on hold for concert tickets.

412
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:53,040
That was tony! Toni! Tone! And
Wet Wet Wet playing together.

413
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,504
You know I can't resist that.
The symmetry alone...

414
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:58,599
All right, Gus,
this is our only choice, man.

415
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:00,706
Fine.

416
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:01,969
Reach down and get it.

417
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:04,137
Me? I'm not gonna
reach down and... You get it.

418
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:05,977
With what hand?

419
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,240
Fine. I'll do it.

420
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:09,560
Hold still.

421
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:16,923
Stop it.

422
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:19,153
- You're wobbling!
- Hold on, now.

423
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:28,198
Stop flexing.

424
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:39,037
No, wait, it's ringing.

425
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,144
Fu's palace.
Want to place order?

426
00:21:44,008 --> 00:21:46,044
You must have dialed the wrong number.

427
00:21:46,164 --> 00:21:48,712
Hi. We're stuck out in
a cabin on tunnel road.

428
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:50,027
Can you send help?

429
00:21:50,147 --> 00:21:51,419
For pickup or delivery?

430
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:53,892
This is Jack Spencer,
and I'm willing to offer you

431
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,404
a 50/50 split on pirate treasure.

432
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,109
- Hang up, shawn.
- Hold on.

433
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,403
While he's on the line,
you guys want anything?

434
00:22:00,563 --> 00:22:03,281
Will you dial it again? And this time
try to dial the right number.

435
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:06,350
Look, man, I'm dialing with a
10-year-old erasermate in my mouth.

436
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,216
It's not an exact science.

437
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:17,420
You've reached Henry Spencer.

438
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,921
Leave your name and number.

439
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:20,947
But speak slowly, because people talk

440
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:24,009
too fast on these things,
and I can never understand it.

441
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:25,928
Dad, what's going on?

442
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:27,913
I got good news...

443
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:29,037
Great news...

444
00:22:29,157 --> 00:22:32,435
The electric wrench you've been
wanting is in stock at home depot.

445
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,473
- what else?
- There was something else.

446
00:22:35,593 --> 00:22:36,423
I know.

447
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:37,831
If you're not too busy,

448
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:40,776
Gus, Jack, and I are tied up
in a cabin about

449
00:22:40,936 --> 00:22:42,837
100 yards off tunnel road,

450
00:22:42,957 --> 00:22:46,160
right by where we had the pulled pork
sandwiches that one time.

451
00:22:46,953 --> 00:22:48,909
Spencer, are you gonna answer
my question or not?

452
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:51,078
How did your dad know
where to find you?

453
00:22:51,238 --> 00:22:53,968
With some people, I can communicate
through psychic wavelengths.

454
00:22:54,088 --> 00:22:56,417
My father is one of them.
Val kilmer is another.

455
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:58,160
Here's something I don't understand.

456
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:00,536
Jack's partner wanted the map, right?

457
00:23:00,656 --> 00:23:02,506
So why would they
trash your dad's house?

458
00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:04,679
They know Jack wouldn't let
the map out of his sight.

459
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,261
Mark and his men,
they weren't looking for a map.

460
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:09,677
So what were they looking for?

461
00:23:15,117 --> 00:23:16,853
You know you're my boy, shawn.

462
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,051
Why'd you have to go
and give mark the map?

463
00:23:20,994 --> 00:23:22,443
Because I don't need it.

464
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:23,867
Uncle Jack, trust me.

465
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:27,281
I can re-create the map
psychically in my head.

466
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:29,110
Spare me, kid, okay?

467
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,149
You can't snow the snowman.

468
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:34,252
We were so close.

469
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:42,959
Stop!

470
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:49,136
I feel jittery!

471
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:50,655
It starts with beans.

472
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,224
Gus likes it in the morning.
Now he has gas.

473
00:23:53,384 --> 00:23:56,476
- Something having to do with coffee?
- Yes! Coffee!

474
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:59,169
Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee table!

475
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,905
Coffee table.

476
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,420
Mark and his goons weren't
looking for the map, were they?

477
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,606
No, no. They were looking
for something else.

478
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:08,530
A different piece of the puzzle.

479
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,812
Something you didn't want
connected to the map at all.

480
00:24:16,978 --> 00:24:19,028
That is downright scary!

481
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:21,206
Maybe you really do have a gift, kid.

482
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:22,800
My bad for doubting it.

483
00:24:23,101 --> 00:24:26,882
Now, this key is also from bouchard's
stuff, I found in argentina.

484
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,173
It was useless without that map,

485
00:24:29,406 --> 00:24:32,802
but if shawn can actually
re-create that map,

486
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:36,392
that plus this key
means we are back on track!

487
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:43,361
Guys, I got to hit the head.

488
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:47,406
But when I come back,
we are finding us a treasure!

489
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:52,074
Hope he bought that.

490
00:24:52,234 --> 00:24:53,510
With Jack, you never know.

491
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:55,595
But if that key is real...

492
00:24:55,715 --> 00:24:57,613
Shawn, come on, take a look around.

493
00:24:57,733 --> 00:25:00,332
Haven't you had enough? These guys,
they destroyed my living room.

494
00:25:00,452 --> 00:25:02,918
Mark and his goons aren't gonna stop.
We gotta get back out there.

495
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:03,857
No!

496
00:25:03,977 --> 00:25:05,379
No, shawn! No!

497
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,126
Just come with us.
Come with us.

498
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:09,345
- Why do you need me?
- It's not that we need you.

499
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:12,719
We want you.
Plus, we need you.

500
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:15,264
We need your truck because my car
is still at the lighthouse,

501
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:16,598
and mark has the key.

502
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:18,301
There you go.
Thank you very much.

503
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:20,060
Sorry. Count me out.

504
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,405
Shocker.

505
00:25:26,393 --> 00:25:27,882
Okay, guys, ready?
Good.

506
00:25:28,002 --> 00:25:29,661
All we got to do now
is borrow a car.

507
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:31,795
Now, technically,
the term is hot-wiring.

508
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:33,907
- However...
- I'm in, but I drive.

509
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:36,543
I'm the one who decides if and when
we go to the police.

510
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:38,100
I don't want any more surprises.

511
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,988
- Do you understand?
- Yes, dad!

512
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:42,439
Big bro, I knew you'd come around.

513
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:44,532
Okay, psychic...

514
00:25:45,197 --> 00:25:46,541
What's the next step?

515
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:07,054
The key will guide us now.

516
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:10,692
I love this.

517
00:26:10,812 --> 00:26:13,196
50/50 split between me and you guys!

518
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:20,390
- No more surprises, right, Jack?
- Of course.

519
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,348
Ya los tenemos.

520
00:26:36,944 --> 00:26:39,556
Tell me this, shawn. How are we
supposed to find clues from a bell tower

521
00:26:39,716 --> 00:26:41,589
that hasn't been around
for over 100 years?

522
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,102
The presidio was huge.
It would've taken up several blocks.

523
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,022
So what should we do now?

524
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:47,647
There's only one thing we can do.

525
00:26:48,082 --> 00:26:49,065
Go back in time.

526
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,052
The bell tower is calling me!

527
00:27:25,886 --> 00:27:27,061
Come on.

528
00:27:34,058 --> 00:27:35,603
Shawn, wait up!

529
00:27:46,276 --> 00:27:47,207
This is it.

530
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:49,256
This is where the bell tower stood.

531
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,335
What do we do now?

532
00:27:51,496 --> 00:27:53,046
Let's buy some mufflers.

533
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:54,901
He doesn't even own a car.

534
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:56,771
I bet you I end up paying for this.

535
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,585
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll survive.

536
00:28:08,002 --> 00:28:10,779
- What are we doing up here, shawn?
- I'm not sure yet.

537
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,524
That's part of the fun, isn't it?

538
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,798
We are good to go.

539
00:28:14,918 --> 00:28:17,088
The manager said we can take
as much time as we need.

540
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:18,528
Alvin, good guy.

541
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:19,646
Filipino.

542
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:20,777
They love me.

543
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:24,758
And Jack offered him 50% of the
treasure. I also gave him an'82 penny.

544
00:28:25,025 --> 00:28:27,279
It was the first year they used
zinc instead of copper.

545
00:28:27,448 --> 00:28:29,387
What is the deal with you
and all these pennies?

546
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:30,870
Yeah, I don't get that either.

547
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,461
So Jack collects them
and then leaves them places?

548
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:34,648
What's that about?

549
00:28:34,768 --> 00:28:36,465
Jack was always interested in history.

550
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:38,800
Collecting pennies was his way
of being a part of it.

551
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,592
But leaving the pennies was his own
personal philosophy.

552
00:28:41,712 --> 00:28:43,346
See, uncle Jack always said...

553
00:28:43,506 --> 00:28:45,466
I leave the penny
because it's good luck,

554
00:28:45,586 --> 00:28:48,316
and lord knows the world
could use more good luck.

555
00:28:48,904 --> 00:28:49,903
Are you for real?

556
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:51,686
All right, what are we doing up here?

557
00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:53,730
You think that when bouchard
captured the fort,

558
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,652
he stood up here on the bell tower,
gazing out into the big blue ocean,

559
00:28:56,772 --> 00:28:58,513
looking for a place
to hide the treasure?

560
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:01,842
If I were a french pirate
with a bad temper and at least

561
00:29:01,962 --> 00:29:05,201
one venereal disease,
where would I be looking?

562
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:20,337
That's it.

563
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:21,968
That's it, right there.

564
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:23,964
We're so close!
Let's go!

565
00:29:31,182 --> 00:29:32,397
How did he find us?

566
00:29:32,707 --> 00:29:33,713
He's got the map.

567
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,696
He must've figured it out.
Come on, let's go!

568
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,735
I can't leave my puma, shawn.

569
00:30:18,256 --> 00:30:19,202
I got it.

570
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:21,375
This is it.

571
00:30:21,495 --> 00:30:23,037
This is the bluff on the map.

572
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:32,872
Uncle Jack!

573
00:30:37,598 --> 00:30:40,279
I know this probably isn't
the right time to say this,

574
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,338
but, dude, I think we're gonna get
to ride in a helicopter.

575
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,153
You're obligated to let me speak...

576
00:30:50,273 --> 00:30:51,603
I'm not obligated to make....

577
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:53,706
Chief, perhaps you should
see this one more time.

578
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:56,062
No, I don't need to see
the letter one more time.

579
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:58,314
Jules, lassie,
what's going on out there?

580
00:30:58,474 --> 00:31:01,295
What's the deal with that guy?
He didn't say a word when he brought us.

581
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:03,069
His name is Andres Candelaria.

582
00:31:03,497 --> 00:31:05,037
He works for the spanish government.

583
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:07,335
Apparently he's part of some
intergovernmental task force

584
00:31:07,455 --> 00:31:09,033
on stolen antiquities.

585
00:31:13,361 --> 00:31:14,531
Hello, Mr. Spencer.

586
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:16,582
I believe you know why you're here.

587
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,536
And I believe you know
I know why I'm here.

588
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:20,503
Now, why am I here?

589
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:23,130
To help us find the treasure
that rightly belongs to my government.

590
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,121
- But we didn't find anything.
- Si.

591
00:31:25,544 --> 00:31:28,177
And my men have been searching the
bluffs all night as well with no luck.

592
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:38,437
That's because you stopped us
one step short.

593
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:41,190
Your treasure's not in the bluffs, che.

594
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:47,019
The spirits are guiding my man paw!

595
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,584
It's like... It's like
that movie idle hands,

596
00:31:49,704 --> 00:31:52,393
except with no nudity,
which means I must be completely

597
00:31:52,513 --> 00:31:54,161
unwatchable right now.

598
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:56,260
Do either of these words
mean anything to anyone?

599
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,107
It could be the clue
we're looking for.

600
00:31:58,227 --> 00:32:00,770
- Cueva is spanish for "cave."
- Couleur could be french.

601
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,795
I think it means "paint."

602
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:04,770
I spent a semester in paris,

603
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,269
got salmonella poisoning,
and lost 20 pounds.

604
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:08,727
Best date ever.

605
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:10,396
Painted caves...
That's it!

606
00:32:10,516 --> 00:32:13,222
Bouchard was french, but he was
fascinated with the chumash indians.

607
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:15,707
Chumash indians?

608
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:17,698
They used to paint caves
all over the area.

609
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:20,098
We used to roust punks in there
from drinking all the time.

610
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:21,645
"Roust punks"?

611
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:22,982
Thank you, Jack lord.

612
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:24,817
We will now lead you
to the treasure.

613
00:32:25,516 --> 00:32:26,593
I know the cave.

614
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:28,577
Very well. Let's go.

615
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,038
Stop. You are not doing this.

616
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:32,388
The only reason I brought these
men here in the first place

617
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:35,077
was because Spencer would'nt talk
with us unless he was in the station.

618
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:38,216
I said we would cooperate with
you, but they are employees of the sbpd,

619
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:40,397
and they're not going anywhere
without my detectives.

620
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:41,920
We have been through this, no?

621
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,534
This is from your treasury department,
giving me full power to call the shots.

622
00:32:45,654 --> 00:32:48,716
Now, I thank you for your help,
but it will no longer be needed.

623
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:50,630
Vamos.

624
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:57,446
Sorry Jules.

625
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:14,511
I can't believe we're actually
digging for buried treasure.

626
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:16,945
I know, dude... And you're getting
your pants totally dirty,

627
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:18,277
and you don't even care.

628
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:19,496
I'm so proud of you.

629
00:33:19,656 --> 00:33:20,539
Keep digging!

630
00:33:34,903 --> 00:33:35,700
H. b.

631
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,738
That could be
for hippolyte de bouchard.

632
00:33:37,858 --> 00:33:39,364
Or harry belafonte.

633
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,226
- No.
- No, that doesn't make any sense.

634
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,847
Just get it out!

635
00:33:51,723 --> 00:33:52,905
Oh, my god.

636
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,908
It's real.

637
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,363
Si.

638
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:00,454
Well done.

639
00:34:00,614 --> 00:34:02,015
Buen trabajo.

640
00:34:02,449 --> 00:34:06,325
You should know the spanish government
owes you a great debt of gratitude.

641
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:07,377
Now...

642
00:34:07,537 --> 00:34:09,286
Could I please have the coins?

643
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,426
Before we do that...

644
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:18,514
I should tell you, I know three things
that you probably don't know.

645
00:34:19,127 --> 00:34:20,265
Uno...

646
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,309
The secret of nimh
andthe secret of my success...

647
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:24,638
Same secret.

648
00:34:24,758 --> 00:34:25,521
Dos...

649
00:34:25,681 --> 00:34:28,857
I know that you don't work
for the spanish government.

650
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:30,984
And tres...

651
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:33,237
These caves are actually quite slippery.

652
00:34:36,692 --> 00:34:39,308
- What are you doing?!
- Grab that, grab that! Right there!

653
00:34:54,103 --> 00:34:56,264
What is going on?
Why are we running?

654
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,053
Why did we leave the caves?

655
00:35:23,238 --> 00:35:24,744
What happened to your other puma?

656
00:35:24,864 --> 00:35:26,779
You got to be kidding me!
I lost another shoe?

657
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,583
Come on.

658
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:32,258
This way!

659
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:37,111
Vamanos!

660
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,938
Jack! Jack!

661
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:51,384
Yes!

662
00:35:52,505 --> 00:35:54,076
Hey guys.
I told you I'd come back.

663
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:56,987
I've been tracking you the whole time.
Do you... Do you have the treasure?

664
00:35:57,521 --> 00:35:58,520
This is it.

665
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,158
I always believed in you, kid!

666
00:36:01,554 --> 00:36:03,034
I always knew you were special!

667
00:36:04,654 --> 00:36:05,701
No, no, no...

668
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:08,149
You can't come in here.
We gotta split up for safety.

669
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:10,733
Now, listen, they're not gonna hurt you
if you don't have the gold.

670
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:12,586
- I know what I'm talking about.
- What?

671
00:36:12,746 --> 00:36:14,337
Come on, let's have it.

672
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,371
Remember the place on foothill

673
00:36:18,491 --> 00:36:21,120
where I used to take you when you were
a kid, get you burgers and shakes?

674
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,511
- It's red robin. It's still there.
- That's the one.

675
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:25,187
I'll meet you there in an hour.

676
00:36:26,306 --> 00:36:27,392
I'll be there.

677
00:36:37,491 --> 00:36:39,821
Damn it! You gave him
the gold, didn't you?

678
00:36:40,403 --> 00:36:41,522
That's my gold!

679
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:43,183
Who the hell are you?

680
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:45,672
If there were doves flying around,
we'd be in a john woo movie.

681
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:46,828
Son of a bitch!

682
00:36:46,988 --> 00:36:48,195
I'm gonna kill Jack!

683
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:50,248
- What? You know Jack?
- He was my partner.

684
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:51,499
He was my partner.

685
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:55,615
Technically, iron giant guy,
he was all of our partners.

686
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:58,090
And the guy who answers
the phone at fu's palace.

687
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,336
- And the guy at the muffler shop.
- Good catch, Gus.

688
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:02,291
Look, we're just gonna roll on out

689
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:04,387
if that's cool, let you settle
your business here.

690
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:05,680
Not so fast.

691
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:07,861
Why don't we just take
the nephew here

692
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:09,415
and ransom his ass for the gold?

693
00:37:09,535 --> 00:37:10,727
We have no other choice.

694
00:37:10,888 --> 00:37:11,665
No, no...

695
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:13,513
You... You always have a choice.

696
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:14,980
You could ransom Gus's ass.

697
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:16,389
You could swirl it up.

698
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:18,610
You could ransom half my ass
and half his ass.

699
00:37:27,248 --> 00:37:28,161
Drop it!

700
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:29,729
Hands in the air!

701
00:37:42,742 --> 00:37:44,638
Shawn, you know
I don't curse very often.

702
00:37:44,758 --> 00:37:46,512
So when I do, you know I mean it.

703
00:37:46,673 --> 00:37:48,009
What the hell just happened?

704
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:50,038
I thought you weren't a big
fan of the wrap-up.

705
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:52,644
All right, i'll give it to you.

706
00:37:52,864 --> 00:37:56,267
So, back at the station,
I realize andres' accent isn't spanish.

707
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:57,377
It's argentinean.

708
00:37:57,722 --> 00:37:59,674
And that's where uncle Jack
just got back from,

709
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:02,357
- I figure he's one of Jack's partners.
- How did you know that?

710
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:05,015
You worked at that winery
in argentina for a year.

711
00:38:05,275 --> 00:38:07,158
- I kept the postcards.
- You did?

712
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:09,077
I use 'em as beer coasters.

713
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,204
Okay, shawn, wh...

714
00:38:11,324 --> 00:38:15,315
So that's why I called andresche,
to see if he'd react, which he did,

715
00:38:15,448 --> 00:38:18,140
because in argentina, che
is slang for "buddy" or "pal,"

716
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,005
sort of like I call you "black star"
or "home skillet" or "big baby burton."

717
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,729
Don't ever call me "home skillet."

718
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:23,645
Right.

719
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:25,633
- But why didn't you tell anybody?
- I did.

720
00:38:26,382 --> 00:38:28,296
She knew just what to do with it.

721
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:33,480
Sorry, Jules.

722
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:44,617
Doesn't matter what happened.

723
00:38:44,737 --> 00:38:47,062
The important thing is you guys
are safe, and nobody got hurt.

724
00:38:47,182 --> 00:38:50,233
Now, let's get out of here.
I'm too old to be staying up all night.

725
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:52,723
I can't believe I lost my other shoe.

726
00:38:53,554 --> 00:38:55,409
Dude, I will buy you another pair.

727
00:38:55,529 --> 00:38:58,348
Just tell me you didn't really
drop 200 bones on sneakers.

728
00:38:58,468 --> 00:38:59,288
No, shawn.

729
00:38:59,408 --> 00:39:00,535
I was making a point.

730
00:39:00,655 --> 00:39:02,866
How much were they really?
80 bucks.

731
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,913
And I have $32 left
on my foot locker gift card.

732
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:08,195
- What am I looking at, like 30 bucks?
- 48.

733
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:09,306
I'm in for half.

734
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:11,224
We'll get some jerk chicken
on the way home.

735
00:39:11,344 --> 00:39:12,432
Fine.

736
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:28,656
Strawberry?

737
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:30,069
You got to taste it.

738
00:39:35,521 --> 00:39:37,458
I'd still go vanilla, but it's good.

739
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:38,964
Are you kidding me?

740
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:40,903
That is the best shake on the planet.

741
00:39:41,023 --> 00:39:43,713
One part ice cream, two parts awesome.

742
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:46,513
It's been a long time
since you called me for a ride.

743
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:51,276
Yeah, Gus got tired of waiting
for someone who wasn't gonna show.

744
00:39:51,396 --> 00:39:54,277
All right, look, shawn, here's the thing
about your uncle Jackie.

745
00:39:54,397 --> 00:39:56,621
He'll always come back.
You're not the first to get duped.

746
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:58,277
You certainly won't be the last.

747
00:39:58,397 --> 00:39:59,753
Welcome to the club, kid.

748
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,481
I guess I probably owe you an apology.

749
00:40:03,044 --> 00:40:05,902
I can see now where uncle Jack
might not have been the best role model.

750
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:08,246
Yeah, maybe not.

751
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,569
Why didn't you say anything
when I was a kid?

752
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:14,643
Because I always wanted you to
have the... The fun uncle in your life.

753
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,497
I was only hard on you because
I didn't want your life to turn out

754
00:40:17,732 --> 00:40:18,925
like the fun uncle.

755
00:40:19,674 --> 00:40:20,649
It didn't...

756
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,273
Not totally.

757
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:28,086
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

758
00:40:31,581 --> 00:40:33,179
You know the penny thing?

759
00:40:33,604 --> 00:40:34,968
Your grandpa taught me that,

760
00:40:35,088 --> 00:40:37,814
and then I taught it to Jack
when we were kids.

761
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,269
He just took it to another whole level.

762
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:43,226
Yeah, he, he seems to do that a lot.

763
00:40:43,346 --> 00:40:46,339
I still can't believe that
he got away with the gold.

764
00:40:46,459 --> 00:40:47,967
I... You got to think that someday

765
00:40:48,087 --> 00:40:50,154
all this stuff is gonna
catch up with him?

766
00:40:50,456 --> 00:40:51,459
Yeah.

767
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:54,487
And that day might just be today.

768
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,000
- Does Gus know about this?
- yeah.

769
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,710
He's got the rest of it.

770
00:41:05,054 --> 00:41:06,886
Don't worry, we're donating
it to the museum.

771
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:07,797
All of it?

772
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:09,025
"Ish." Wha...

773
00:41:10,057 --> 00:41:12,244
I saw Jack following us.

774
00:41:12,462 --> 00:41:14,412
I knew he was gonna show up
in the car.

775
00:41:15,148 --> 00:41:18,052
I made the switch when we were
running through the forest.

776
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,893
So what does Jack have?

777
00:41:45,574 --> 00:41:46,896
Well done, shawnie.

778
00:41:49,297 --> 00:41:50,339
Well done.

779
