1
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:09,883
This is humiliating, Dad.

2
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:12,678
Not as humiliating
as being the parent

3
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:15,973
of the only child sent home
from his school with lice.

4
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:19,458
That shampoo smells
like urinal cakes.

5
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,147
Smelling like a men's room
is a small price to pay

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,065
for ridding your scalp of parasites.

7
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:26,962
- How did I get lice, anyways?
- You tell me.

8
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:29,779
You come in contact
with anything out of ordinary lately?

9
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:31,587
No, unless you count that squirrel

10
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:33,658
with the foamy mouth
I've been playing with.

11
00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:38,398
It's a good thing they sent you home.
All it takes is one unclean child

12
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:40,705
to start a full-blown outbreak.

13
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,087
What's an outbreak?

14
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:45,690
It's when an illness
is passed from person to person

15
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:48,175
until it becomes widespread.

16
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:50,154
How's it passed?

17
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:52,798
One could come in contact
with a sick person

18
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,763
or maybe even something
they've touched.

19
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:59,767
- Like a comb?
- Exactly, like a comb.

20
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:03,145
Wait. Why did you say comb?

21
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:05,146
Because I used yours this morning.

22
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:11,649
Oh, my God...

23
00:01:16,234 --> 00:01:17,159
Damn it.

24
00:01:18,142 --> 00:01:19,582


25
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:41,880
I don't know what smells worse,
that breakfast burrito

26
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,352
or those nacho cheese cornnuts
you used to eat.

27
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:46,853
Let's do a smell test.
Here, close your eyes.

28
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:49,978
- What's going on with you?
- Whatever do you mean?

29
00:01:50,103 --> 00:01:52,792
Why are you eating stinky food and
dressed like you're going tailgating?

30
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:54,382
I'll tell you exactly why.

31
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:55,815
Because I can.

32
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,394
Okay, I get it.

33
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,224
Now that you're single, you're doing
the things Abigail wouldn't let you do

34
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,355
- while you were dating.
- You nailed it.

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,982
Which is why I'm tivoing <i>Blame it on Rio</i>
as we speak.

36
00:02:05,107 --> 00:02:06,157
And dude...

37
00:02:10,204 --> 00:02:12,920
- My favorite ringer is back.
- Please tell me it's not.

38
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:20,610
- My piece of art is back on the wall.
- It's not art.

39
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:23,976
It's a poster of a hot blonde laying
on a Corvette that says "hauling ass".

40
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:26,437
If it's not art, why did I insure it
for $1/2 million?

41
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,864
- Because you're an idiot.
- Guys?

42
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:32,175
What's up?

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,567
- Why does it smell like old diaper?
- Beats me.

44
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:37,142
What's up with you?

45
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,617
I'm actually meeting
this guy for coffee.

46
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,619
You mean, like a date?

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,955
- I guess you could call it that.
- What if we didn't?

48
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:47,596
It's with Richard.
From forensics.

49
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,836
We know Richard from forensics.
He's the guy with the big...

50
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,672
You know that giant,
giant, set of...

51
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,180
Ears?

52
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:59,996
Oh, no. I've never noticed his ears.
You know me, Mr. Non-judgmental.

53
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,995
- He also goes by Mr. Dobalina.
- Mr. Bob Dobalina.

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,670
I'm actually running late.
So maybe I'll see you guys later.

55
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:10,059
Good luck!

56
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:13,609
- Jealous much?
- Of who? Richard?

57
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:15,810
The man looks like a cab
with its doors open.

58
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:19,341
Please, that's why you were all...
"what do you mean, like a date?"

59
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,347
All right, first of all,
you have to stop using

60
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,619
the "I'm not falling
for no banana in my tailpipe" voice

61
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,439
every time you imitate
a white person.

62
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:27,938
Secondly, I'm a grown man,
I am confident,

63
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:30,165
and I can admit that, yes,
I'm a little jealous.

64
00:03:30,317 --> 00:03:33,629
Why don't you do something about it?
She doesn't sound too keen on the guy.

65
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:36,815
- You're not getting any younger.
- Yes, but my hair is getting thicker.

66
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,375
And I have seeds to sow.

67
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:40,902
Don't worry,
guy-who-uses-words-like-keen.

68
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:44,180
There is plenty of time
for me and Jules.

69
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:48,310
All right. What is this?

70
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:56,527
Nice to meet you guys.
I'm Donny Lieberman.

71
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:59,071
Did you have a few cocktails
for breakfast there, Donny?

72
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,449
Oh, no. Do I reek?

73
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,408
I went out last night,
got kinda wasted.

74
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:03,741
You smell like tequila.

75
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,706
Which is still preferable
to those cornnuts.

76
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:06,979
That's just a lie.

77
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,466
You guys gotta help me.
Because I messed up.

78
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:11,417
I mean, I really, really messed up.

79
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:13,216
It's not your fault.

80
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:15,379
Oh, good. How do you know?

81
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:17,525
I don't.
But when people say that in movies,

82
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,967
things seemed to get
fixed almost magically.

83
00:04:20,732 --> 00:04:23,804
Here's the deal. I work for a courier
service that specializes

84
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,953
in the transport
of biomedical materials.

85
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:28,955
And yesterday I was told
to pick up a cooler from a lab

86
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,229
called Genutech, take it back
to my hotel by the airport,

87
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,176
then fly to CDC headquarters
in Atlanta this morning.

88
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:37,175
But like an idiot, I went out.

89
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,612
And when I woke up this morning,
the cooler was gone.

90
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,328
And I have no idea what I did with it,
because I was so drunk,

91
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:44,253
the entire night's a blur.

92
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:46,614
It's not your fault.

93
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:49,490
- What exactly was in the cooler?
- Kidney?

94
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:51,865
The disembodied soul
of Marsellus Wallace?

95
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,741
Okay, please know
that I would have never gone out

96
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:57,879
had I known at the time
what was inside the cooler.

97
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,340
What was in the cooler?

98
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:02,927
The Thornburg virus.

99
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:05,304
The Thornburg virus?

100
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,723
What does this have to do
with Richard Chamberlain?

101
00:05:07,994 --> 00:05:10,726
That's <i>the thorn birds</i>.
Thornburg is an extremely rare virus

102
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:14,355
that usually targets people in Africa...
Which makes it racist, by the way.

103
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:16,108
Let me get this straight.

104
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,524
You hit the town.

105
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:20,056
You got sloppy drunk.
Passed out.

106
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:22,691
Woke up without a virus?

107
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:24,823
Isn't it usually
the other way around?

108
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:28,747
Normally I would notify the police
or the CDC in a situation like this.

109
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:31,748
But I was just thinking that
maybe if we find it first,

110
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,076
then no one has to be the wiser.

111
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,210
Is there anything else
that's missing?

112
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,546
Yes, my antique gold watch
given to me by my father.

113
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:43,592
If someone were to open this cooler,
what would happen, exactly?

114
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:48,504
If someone went so far as to touch
the contents of the vial,

115
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:50,758
that... That would not be good.

116
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,503
How not good are we talking?

117
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:55,630
Thornburg moves pretty quickly
once you have it, you know?

118
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,843
And there's a host of symptoms.
There's headaches,

119
00:05:57,968 --> 00:05:59,443
weakness, bleeding...

120
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,192
Sometimes even from the eyes.

121
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:11,328
Excuse me, miss.

122
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:12,663
Miss?

123
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,423
Psych 413
"Death is in the Air"

124
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,218
Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

125
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:15,399
We should come back here
and hang out with our skateboards.

126
00:07:15,524 --> 00:07:17,124
You know that's right.

127
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:19,900
I have never seen the two of you arrive
so fast at a police scene.

128
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:22,836
You've never seen us called to one
with a grape slushie machine either.

129
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:25,088
The woman who died
had blood dripping from her eye?

130
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:27,362
Yeah, it's really freaky.
She's right there.

131
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,698
There's no I.D. on the body yet.
Probably another junkie.

132
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,158
Hold up, hold up.

133
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:34,155
I'm getting something.
Granted, this could be some kind

134
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,705
of Pavlovian brain freeze
caused by the slushie machine but...

135
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:40,591
No, this is real.
Drugs did not kill that woman.

136
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:42,127
It was <i>the thorn birds</i> virus.

137
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,422
- Do you mean Thornburg?
- What he said.

138
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:48,884
I studied that in school.
Has there ever been a case in the U.S.?

139
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,595
No, there's not enough black people.

140
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,649
There's never been a case.
Has anyone touched that body?

141
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,641
Not yet.
Still waiting for the coroner.

142
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,643
I strongly suggest no one go near it

143
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,797
unless they're wearing
one of those big...

144
00:07:59,922 --> 00:08:02,523
cumbersome stay puft
protective suits.

145
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,525
- Hazmat?
- Please don't make up words.

146
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,159
I'm not about
to create mass hysteria

147
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:09,321
just because you saw
<i>Outbreak</i> this weekend.

148
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,536
Dude, I saw that movie once,
like, ten years ago.

149
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:13,367
I missed
the first 23 minutes altogether.

150
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,369
He has an irrational fear
of Patrick Dempsey.

151
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,163
It's very rational. It's rational.
Either of you watch <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>?

152
00:08:18,473 --> 00:08:21,500
- The man is completely terrifying.
- You're just jealous of his hair.

153
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,696
- Well, there's that.
- There's only that.

154
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:27,129
Trust me, Lassie, I'm getting
a very clear signal on this.

155
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:29,841
Thornburg virus.
There is no way.

156
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,009
Right, O'Hara?

157
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,520
Step away from that body.
That's an order.

158
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:36,881
I don't want to take the chance
that he's wrong.

159
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:38,656
I'm gonna call the CDC.

160
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,558
You were right
to raise the possibility,

161
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:47,818
even if it turns out
that wasn't Thornburg that got her.

162
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:52,958
I don't think
we're gonna get that lucky.

163
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:01,548
Donny!

164
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,010
Does this woman
look familiar to you?

165
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:11,737
- Is she dead?
- As a bag of rocks.

166
00:09:11,862 --> 00:09:13,762
It's dumb as a bag of rocks.

167
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,676
Guess what she was wearing
on her wrist?

168
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:17,681
- Don't know.
- Your watch.

169
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:20,423
So I killed her?

170
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:23,428
Oh, god. The tequila.

171
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:26,615
- It turned me into Ted Bundy.
- No, Donny. You're not ted bundy.

172
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,491
You didn't kill her.
Not directly.

173
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:30,277
There was blood
dripping from her eye.

174
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:32,993
- She had Thornburg?
- It's a possibility.

175
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:35,976
If she had your watch,
she may also have had your cooler.

176
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:40,619
Donny, breathe. Stop.

177
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,932
Breathe in. Breathe out.

178
00:09:43,057 --> 00:09:45,891
In, out. Here, chew this gum.

179
00:09:48,308 --> 00:09:49,546
It's delicious.

180
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,253
- Explosion of flavor.
- Delicious.

181
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:53,873
Now listen.
If we're gonna retrieve your cooler,

182
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:55,723
we have to figure out
who this woman is.

183
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:57,873
Are you sure
you've never seen her before?

184
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,681
- I don't know.
- Concentrate, man!

185
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:05,436
We were drinking
together last night.

186
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:06,855
Great. What else?

187
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:10,316
We were eating. Chicken Katsu.

188
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,985
Yummy, apricot sauce?

189
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,071
- Do you remember where you were?
- No, but...

190
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,757
The place had a bunch of...

191
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:20,369
Tiki torches!

192
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:24,931
Are you sure this is the place?

193
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:28,193
I'm absolutely positive, Donny.
My psychic senses are never off.

194
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:30,379
And this is the bar in your hotel.

195
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,422
I'm never drinking again.

196
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,008
There he is.
There's the guy.

197
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:38,083
- I have something of yours.
- You do?

198
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,846
- Yeah, here it is.
- Leave it!

199
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,599
You remember wearing this thing?

200
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:45,623
You were like,
"check me out. I'm rainbow man."

201
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:47,436
You're a madman.

202
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,107
- Let me buy you a drink.
- I'll have a club soda

203
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:52,732
with three pineapple wedges.

204
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,949
And if you can get
the hippy hippy shake going,

205
00:10:55,074 --> 00:10:57,239
flip a few glasses
and introduce me to Elizabeth Shue,

206
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,656
there's an extra fiver in it
for you.

207
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:02,045
We're actually here
to help rainbow man

208
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,788
fill in the blanks from last night.
He's having a hard time remembering.

209
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:05,825
I'll bet.

210
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,001
He and this smokin' brunette
must've had 20 tequila shots.

211
00:11:09,263 --> 00:11:11,628
You wouldn't happen to remember
her name, would you?

212
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:14,541
- I believe her name was Ginger.
- Ginger.

213
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,134
- Do you know where they went by chance?
- Don't worry.

214
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:18,378
I do.

215
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:25,956
I can't believe it.
This is crazy.

216
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:27,768
So I took her back to my room?

217
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:30,689
I never do that.
Is it possible I have game?

218
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,903
Apparently you did last night.
She was quite taken with you.

219
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:39,323
- Really?
- No, she was a prostitute.

220
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:41,771
Come on.

221
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:44,202
Think about it.
You met her in a hotel bar.

222
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,591
Plus, her name is Ginger.

223
00:11:45,716 --> 00:11:48,238
Throughout history there's only
two Gingers that weren't prostitutes:

224
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:50,525
Ginger Rogers
and Ginger from <i>Gilligan's Island</i>.

225
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,103
I still have my suspicions
about the latter. In fact,

226
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:55,964
I've made my decision.
She was a filthy pirate hooker.

227
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,401
You know that's right.

228
00:11:57,526 --> 00:11:59,634
Yeah, well,
at least I scored, right?

229
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,474
Donny, your friend Ginger
targeted you, okay?

230
00:12:05,963 --> 00:12:07,893
That means her plan was
to get you sloppy drunk,

231
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:10,395
wait till you pass out,
and rob you blind.

232
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,717
Yeah, but why would
she take the cooler?

233
00:12:12,842 --> 00:12:15,108
Maybe she thought it
contained something valuable.

234
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:18,143
<i>The stuff I transfer
is really valuable.</i>

235
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:21,530
That's probably right.

236
00:12:23,113 --> 00:12:24,113
That's me.

237
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:26,745
I cannot wait till you find
a new girlfriend.

238
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,581
Shawn, you were totally right.

239
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,458
- About what, Atlantis?
- <i>No!</i>

240
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,251
About the girl.
She had Thornburg.

241
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:36,213
<i>We can't be 100% sure,
but all of her symptoms are consistent.</i>

242
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:39,424
CDC's on it's way.
And her name was Jennifer Cotsitas.

243
00:12:39,785 --> 00:12:42,593
Let me guess. She's a prostitute
who went by the name "Ginger".

244
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:45,204
You nailed it.

245
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,949
It's really important
that I get this girl's address.

246
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:49,665
I Need to go by there.

247
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:51,852
That's where I'm calling you from.

248
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:54,540
And Shawn, she must be a great hooker.
This place is sweet.

249
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:56,632
You kidding?
Listen to me, Jules.

250
00:12:56,914 --> 00:12:59,414
If you see anything
that even resembles a cooler,

251
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:00,820
don't go near it, okay?

252
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't worry.
We have combed this place head to toe

253
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,979
and there's absolutely nothing
like that here.

254
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:06,888
But get this, in one of her drawers,

255
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,813
we found $10,000 in cash
in a fresh envelope.

256
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,606
Hold on a second.

257
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:14,543
- You're not missing ten grand?
- Are you kidding?

258
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,268
I can't be missing
something I never had.

259
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,632
Somebody hired her
to steal the cooler.

260
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:22,484
- I'm back.
- <i>And one more thing.</i>

261
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:24,886
<i>In that envelope, we found
one of those old school hotel keys</i>

262
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:26,805
to the El Capitan.

263
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:31,560
Let me guess. Room 106?

264
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:34,395
No, but that's really close.
It's room 128.

265
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:36,736
128?

266
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,925
Excuse me.
We just checked into this room.

267
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,488
Do you could come back later?

268
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:45,239
- But it's not clean.
- That's okay.

269
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:46,614
Neither are we.

270
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:56,177
Check this out.

271
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:58,392
That's weird.

272
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:01,444
- Let me call the front desk.
- What's going on?

273
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,181
Donny, whoever rented this room

274
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:07,262
paid our friend Ginger
to steal the cooler from you.

275
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:09,477
Hhe waited for her to make the drop,

276
00:14:09,602 --> 00:14:12,726
I'm guessing curiosity got
the best of her and she opened it up.

277
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:15,769
But why would someone
want to buy the virus?

278
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:16,969
I have a guess.

279
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:19,441
And much like this bedspread,
it's not pretty.

280
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,185
This room was paid for in cash
and registered to a Val Kilmer.

281
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,364
It's either an alias
or Val has officially lost it.

282
00:14:26,622 --> 00:14:28,115
So what now?

283
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,375
I could go for some joe.

284
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,501
This is a waste of time. We're rushing
to check out some coffee place

285
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,938
that some mysterious person
who may or may not

286
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:42,441
be carrying a deadly virus
may or may not have visited.

287
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:46,001
Well, I for one,
trust Mr. Spencer's instincts on this.

288
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:47,065
Who is this?

289
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,567
We need to look into every possible lead
at this point.

290
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:52,392
Besides,
you were already wrong once today.

291
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:55,435
I've never seen Lassie
put in his place.

292
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,567
It's hot.
I'd like her to put me in my place.

293
00:14:57,692 --> 00:14:58,980
That makes no sense.

294
00:15:10,445 --> 00:15:12,536
Spencer, what the
hell are you doing?

295
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:17,260
Sorry, man.

296
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:20,627
You might want to get a biscotti.
You could be in there for a while.

297
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:25,067
CDC is pretty much done in there.

298
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:28,860
Everyone from the cafe has been moved
to quarantine at Santa Barbara general.

299
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:31,881
Why don't you wipe
that smile off your face, McNab?

300
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:34,819
Is this really necessary?
I didn't even go inside the cafe.

301
00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:36,308
It's necessary.

302
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,354
Yeah, the CDC doesn't want
to take any chances, so...

303
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,133
For the last time,
who the hell is this?

304
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,433
I'm Donny Lieberman.

305
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:45,694
I'm the guy who...
screwed all this up.

306
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:47,279
I'm not big on nude handshakes.

307
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,492
They're probably just being safe.

308
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,491
That tickles.

309
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:54,323
Spencer, are you
shampooing your hair?

310
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:55,824
Yes, I am, Lassie.

311
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:57,574
I always travel with a small packet

312
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:00,166
of Johnson & Johnson's
baby shampoo in my wallet.

313
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:01,458
Baby shampoo?

314
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:03,142
No more tears, Jules.

315
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:07,591
Take it easy, slugger.
What, are we dating?

316
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,055
I can't believe this.
First, we're looking for a prostitute.

317
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,721
- Now, I'm naked in a parking lot.
- It's just like our prom night.

318
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,266
- Shawn?
- Gus, relax.

319
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,140
Don't be Nic Cage's accent
from <i>Con Air</i>.

320
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:19,143
- We've bathed together before.
- When we were three.

321
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:22,142
It's essentially the same thing.
It's just impolite to pee.

322
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:24,217
That feels great, by the way.

323
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:33,581
Dude, I'm freezing.
Give me your damn sweatshirt.

324
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:34,959
Ffine.

325
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,770
You're lucky I had it in the car.

326
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,788
You'll like how it smells.
Smell it.

327
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:39,957
Doctor...

328
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,147
Detective Carlton lassiter.

329
00:16:43,272 --> 00:16:44,722
Dr. Steven Reidman.

330
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,005
Thornburg specialist, CDC.

331
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:49,774
Dr. Reidman is
the foremost Thornburg authority

332
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:52,052
not only in this state,
but in all seven continents.

333
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,763
- He's here to help us.
- Is he, Jules?

334
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:58,433
No offense, doctor, but there's
a lot of freaky-deaky stuff going on.

335
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:01,686
How can we be sure
that you're a legit M.D.?

336
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:05,443
Well, for starters,
I carry one of these in my pocket.

337
00:17:06,431 --> 00:17:07,278
He's legit.

338
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:09,402
Excuse me, doctor,
I feel I'm the most at risk

339
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,717
being that this virus
is a profiling racist.

340
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:13,865
I'm going to need an MRI,
a cat scan, a pet scan,

341
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:17,343
- and a biopsy of everything.
- I'd like some mac and cheese,

342
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:20,080
but I don't think this is "
ask for whatever you want day."

343
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,248
Stop it!

344
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:24,876
- What do we know so far?
- I had this hospital prepared

345
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,212
as soon as I heard
that the virus had been stolen.

346
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:30,423
Now, the cafe patrons are currently
in isolation along with the courier

347
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,472
because he was around
the virus a lot.

348
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:35,845
Now, so far, only two are showing
the early symptoms of Thornburg.

349
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,513
Only two? Thank God.

350
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:38,890
I will hazard a guess

351
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:41,178
that they touched
the sample accidentally,

352
00:17:41,303 --> 00:17:43,103
because the virus is
not typically effective

353
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:44,297
as an aerosol.

354
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,125
Unlike Axe for men,
which is highly effective.

355
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:49,083
It's like catnip for women.

356
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,071
As I was saying,
normally one has to come in contact

357
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:55,448
with an infected
person's secretions.

358
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,827
But the good news is,
if any of these people were infected,

359
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,884
there is a lab less
than two hours away

360
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:04,385
in which they are developing
a new antiviral

361
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,960
that has shown positive results
in early testing.

362
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,449
- When's it gonna get here?
- En route as we speak.

363
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:12,624
And since our culprit
has already used his sample,

364
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:14,498
I think it's safe to say

365
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:17,388
that we have this problem
pretty well bottled up.

366
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,200
Potential disaster averted.

367
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:22,396
Speaking of disasters, doctor,
what is your opinion

368
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:23,977
of detective Lassiter's hair?

369
00:18:26,204 --> 00:18:27,354
Scientifically...

370
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:30,828
If he were to grow it,
his ears wouldn't stick out as much.

371
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:32,420
- Well, if you...
- Carlton.

372
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:35,029
We need to get an I.D.
on the man who did this.

373
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,891
Is it safe to interview
the patients?

374
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,117
Just remember
to wear the hazmat suit.

375
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:44,017
Spencer one to ground control.

376
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:46,333
I am ready to commence orbit.

377
00:18:48,147 --> 00:18:50,272
We read you loud and clear,
Spencer one.

378
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:51,397
Good luck.

379
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:55,133
Greetings, I'm Shawn Spencer.

380
00:18:57,899 --> 00:18:59,539
Roger that, ground control.

381
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:02,247
So, Melissa,

382
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:03,683
hello.

383
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:06,644
Did you notice anyone suspicious
in the cafe today?

384
00:19:07,174 --> 00:19:09,324
Anyone who entered or left abruptly?

385
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:10,639
Not really.

386
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,647
But I was reading my book
most of the time.

387
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:13,567
I see.

388
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,027
And how are you feeling?

389
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:16,529
Nervous, mostly.

390
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:17,821
Perfectly normal.

391
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,717
Do you need us
to contact anyone for you?

392
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:22,577
A husband or boyfriend?

393
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:25,128
I'm single.

394
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:28,404
- But my sister's on her way.
- Really?

395
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:30,668
Gus, you should be
ashamed of yourself.

396
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:33,129
Let me handle this.
Melissa,

397
00:19:33,594 --> 00:19:36,632
how many sexual partners have you had
in the last six months?

398
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:40,804
Enough with that song already.

399
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,097
I can't reach my back pocket.
Punch me in the ass.

400
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,845
- You must be outta your mind.
- Just sock me in the butt.

401
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,852
Do you guys work for the hospital?

402
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:54,082
So you didn't notice
anything suspicious in the cafe.

403
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:56,945
According to your file,
under "medications,"

404
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,598
you have listed neither
rogaine or minoxidil.

405
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:01,533
- Is that correct?
- That's right.

406
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:04,914
Really?
You don't wanna try either of those?

407
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:07,358
Why?

408
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:09,727
Dude, I think there's something wrong
with my suit.

409
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:13,336
- There's some rank smell in here now.
- You're like a giant dutch oven.

410
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,494
Wait a second. I feel a bulge
in your sweatshirt pocket.

411
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:18,967
- Are those your damn cornnuts?
- I was looking for those.

412
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,664
Nothing should smell that bad.

413
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:22,380
- You can't take that off.
- Why not?

414
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:25,006
You have to make a choice
between nacho cheese heaven

415
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:27,807
and something that could
potentially kill you.

416
00:20:29,232 --> 00:20:30,905
- Well?
- I'm thinking.

417
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,450
Nine people questioned and nothing?

418
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,695
- What next?
- Next taste these.

419
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:44,825
Okay, the antivirals are here.
Let's unpack and administer to the sick.

420
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,708
<i>Yesterday, I was told to pick up
a cooler from a lab called Genutech.</i>

421
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,210
Dude... Same lab that had the vial

422
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,504
of Thornburg
is also supplying the cure.

423
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,340
- Don't you think that's weird?
- I still smell like stinky nuts.

424
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:03,677
Gus, we don't have
four hours to riff on that. Let's go.

425
00:21:08,378 --> 00:21:10,792
Dude, check it out.
It's Christopher Lloyd.

426
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,995
That man does not
look like Chris Lloyd.

427
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,597
Show some respect.
He's 14 times smarter than you.

428
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:16,889
OK. I'm sorry.

429
00:21:18,465 --> 00:21:19,735
- Can I help?
- We're

430
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,726
with cops
and CDC on this outbreak thing.

431
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:25,198
Already told those guys that we shipped
all the antivirals we had in storage.

432
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,451
You shipped everything you
have for 2 patients?

433
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,123
They're going to need every drop.
Dr. Reidman says

434
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,439
that the first patient
needed 4 times the doses

435
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,082
that we'd estimated.

436
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,237
And they want to administer it
to everyone.

437
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,880
- So you're making more?
- Not yet. We were shut down a week ago.

438
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,796
- Strike a clock tower with lightning?
- No.

439
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:46,637
We lost our funding
because the government

440
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,403
didn't see Thornburg
as a serious threat.

441
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:53,018
But all these people
getting sick is great news.

442
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:57,022
Great for the lab.
And great for Dr. Mallon.

443
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:58,392
Dr. Mallon?

444
00:21:58,693 --> 00:21:59,921
This is his lab.

445
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:02,187
He got the funding
to open up this place.

446
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:04,363
He worked for years
on the antiviral.

447
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,073
But if this thing gets worse,

448
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:09,231
we might start back up.

449
00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:12,803
Excuse us.
We're gonna side bar, eh?

450
00:22:17,123 --> 00:22:21,123
Mallon spends years on a cure,
develop it, then his lab gets shut down.

451
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:24,022
A few days later,
a Thornburg outbreak happens.

452
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:26,190
He took a sample to infect people,

453
00:22:26,315 --> 00:22:29,470
and then forced the government
to put his lab back in business.

454
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:32,058
We're back!

455
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:37,396
So tell me, since Dr. Mallon isn't here,
whereabouts might we find him?

456
00:22:37,591 --> 00:22:39,830
I'm not sure.
I've been trying to call him.

457
00:22:39,955 --> 00:22:42,412
But you can look for his address
in that box.

458
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:45,070
It's the stuff lefted over
from his office after it was emptied.

459
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:50,086
Do you think they have
radioactive spiders?

460
00:22:50,211 --> 00:22:51,363
Shawn, focus.

461
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,093
Let's see what we got here.

462
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,050
A fan of the theater.

463
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:06,300
<i>Why?</i>

464
00:23:07,228 --> 00:23:08,928
We've already got
this guy quarantined.

465
00:23:15,957 --> 00:23:19,535
We're a little busy. The second person
who tested positive for Thornburg

466
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,190
broke out before we treated him
with the antiviral.

467
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,634
Let me take
a psychic stab at that...

468
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:27,196
Pasty white guy
desperately in need of hair plugs?

469
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,211
- That's right.
- Don't worry about him being sick.

470
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:33,771
I'm sensing that he has
his own stash of the cure.

471
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:37,049
- How is that possible?
- Because not only did he invent it,

472
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:40,910
I'm sensing that he also stole
the Thornburg and then released it.

473
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:42,803
Oh, God.

474
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,875
It's okay. Luckily there was
only one vial of the virus.

475
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,425
He's already used that.

476
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:51,587
Excuse me. We shipped three vials
of the virus, not one.

477
00:23:54,214 --> 00:23:55,564
There's two more.

478
00:23:56,465 --> 00:23:59,415
Scratch that, Jules.
We have a big, big problem.

479
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:13,867
You know, you've never
actually led a manhunt before,

480
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,953
so maybe I should be the one to instruct
the troops on finding Mallon.

481
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:20,290
No, I ordered the coroner
to diagnose,

482
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:22,626
I called in the CDC,
I do the briefing.

483
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:28,586
Just remember, exude confidence
and strength, but also heart and warmth.

484
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:31,777
You want to get behind the troops.
Try to project intelligence

485
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,512
without sounding too...

486
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,614
- Pompous?
- Exactly.

487
00:24:37,605 --> 00:24:39,305
You might just get this.

488
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:44,510
Everybody, listen up.

489
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:46,109
- Attention, please.
- Attention.

490
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:49,506
Eyes on detective O'Hara.
You're gonna do great.

491
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:52,303
This is Dr. Anthony Mallon.

492
00:24:52,428 --> 00:24:54,571
Finding him is the top priority.

493
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:56,474
Find him but do not confront him.

494
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,029
Yes, thank you, detective.

495
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,872
Do not confront him.
If you do locate him...

496
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:04,459
- Call for backup.
- Thank you, again, detective.

497
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:07,296
- Do not startle him.
- He is carrying a very dangerous...

498
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,841
Virus!

499
00:25:13,297 --> 00:25:15,461
If I may, detective.

500
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,890
Locating and bringing him
in safely is crucial.

501
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:21,393
Keep in mind the best place
to release her

502
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,629
is in a public crowded place.

503
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:26,863
Preferably with a lot of people
coming and going frequently.

504
00:25:26,988 --> 00:25:28,258
- Yes?
- Her?

505
00:25:28,724 --> 00:25:31,695
- Thornburg.
- The virus in the feminine tense?

506
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,405
Indeed. If you knew her as I do,

507
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,241
there's no mistaking her
for anything other than a she.

508
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,932
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Neither do women.

509
00:25:39,057 --> 00:25:39,995
I hear that.

510
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:44,684
<i>A fan of the theater.</i>

511
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:49,824
I'm getting something.
I think I know what the next

512
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,256
target might be.

513
00:25:51,444 --> 00:25:55,260
I see the bus station...
and the Santa Barbara public theatre.

514
00:25:55,481 --> 00:25:57,971
Both would work
both have heavy foot traffic.

515
00:25:58,216 --> 00:26:01,808
But I would bet on the bus station,
there's greater population turnover.

516
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,978
- All right, everybody. You heard him.
- Let's move.

517
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:06,356
Excuse me.

518
00:26:06,544 --> 00:26:08,190
You divined this psychically?

519
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,276
- That's right.
- Fascinating.

520
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:13,361
If you should pass away, I would love
to dissect your temporal lobe.

521
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:15,897
Sure. I can't possibly see why not.

522
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:18,325
But I hope you get us
all through this alive.

523
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:22,490
Yes, in that case, I would love to get
my hands on a sample of your dna.

524
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:23,746
Weird.

525
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:25,129
Uncomfortable.

526
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:27,418
- Consider it done.
- I'm actually the brain

527
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,900
behind this operation,
you might want to get mine.

528
00:26:30,025 --> 00:26:32,631
I could care less
about your secretions.

529
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:36,289
However, I would love
to get my craniometer around

530
00:26:36,414 --> 00:26:38,252
that giant raisinet of yours.

531
00:26:38,377 --> 00:26:39,638
Or is it a goober?

532
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,354
Possibly a milk ball.

533
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:44,833
I say milk ball.

534
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:46,382
It's milk ball.

535
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,862
Cover those exits. I do not want
this guy getting away from us again.

536
00:26:57,018 --> 00:27:00,042
And whatever you do,
don't start a panic.

537
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,033
Go!

538
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:07,540
Oh, hell.

539
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,657
Citizens, stay away from this area.

540
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:20,011
You may have already been exposed
to a deadly biological agent.

541
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,514
Is it important
that you do not leave.

542
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,719
Because you could spread it
to your loved ones

543
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:26,090
and kill them.

544
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,700
Detective,
this is a broken lightbulb.

545
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,281
As you were.

546
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:43,201
Some lightbulbs have
halogen gas in them.

547
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,571
And tungsten.
There's a fun word.

548
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,779
Tungsten, tungsten, tungsten.

549
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:49,749
Correction,
it's only fun to say it twice.

550
00:27:49,942 --> 00:27:52,942
Why don't you get out of sight?
Mallon knows what you look like,

551
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:54,587
and you're not trained.

552
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:58,258
What part of training is announcing
our presence with a megaphone?

553
00:27:59,517 --> 00:28:01,553
Go hide in a bathroom
and stay out of our way.

554
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:05,188
All right, we'll go. But not because
you told us to. Gus has to tinkle.

555
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:12,152
He must be out of his mind if he thinks
I'm going to hide in a bathroom all day.

556
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:22,984
Gus, that's him.
That's him!

557
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:14,335
Hold it!

558
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,310
You should be all right, Shawn.

559
00:29:41,435 --> 00:29:43,406
The seal on the vial is unbroken.

560
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:47,074
- We are lucky that you grabbed it.
- I'm no hero, Steve.

561
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:50,412
I didn't do anything that anyone
with incredible upper body strength

562
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:53,038
and native American cheekbones
wouldn't do.

563
00:29:54,886 --> 00:29:57,989
Hero? Because of you,
we lost Mallon.

564
00:29:58,114 --> 00:30:01,446
He probably ran when he saw you.
You blew the whole operation, Spencer.

565
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:03,915
I told you to go hide in the toilet.

566
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,016
All units, move to secondary target.
That's the theater on main street.

567
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:10,849
Something doesn't make sense. He was
on his way out when I spotted him.

568
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:13,101
Why did he leave
before releasing the Juju Mugumbo?

569
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:14,767
He aborted his plan.

570
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:19,566
He saw Mallon hovering by a newsstand.
Said he was sweating pretty badly.

571
00:30:20,097 --> 00:30:21,097
Really?

572
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:32,916
I'm sensing he was limping as well.

573
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,623
Barley noticeable.
He's sick, Jules. He has Thornburg.

574
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,542
I thought he had the cure.

575
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,760
<i>They're gonna need every drop.</i>

576
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:43,885
<i>Dr. Reidman says that the first patient
needed four times the estimated dosage.</i>

577
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:46,801
He does. But he didn't realize
it wouldn't be enough.

578
00:30:46,986 --> 00:30:49,630
He started showing symptoms
when he got here, and then he booked.

579
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:52,557
I can see him.
It's him or Michael Ironside.

580
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,726
Why having
a vision of Michael Ironside?

581
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,519
Exactly.
I know where he's going.

582
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:18,541
Looking for this?
It's the last of your cure.

583
00:31:19,248 --> 00:31:21,206
It's why you came back
to the hospital.

584
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:23,589
You've been self-medicating
but still infected.

585
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:25,474
You didn't realize
how much of this stuff

586
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:26,966
it takes to fight your virus.

587
00:31:27,284 --> 00:31:28,561
Give it to me. Now!

588
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:31,221
We know everything, man.

589
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:33,598
We know you did all of this
to save your lab.

590
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,342
That wasn't why.

591
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:39,236
When they shut me down,
they left you and me

592
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:41,397
and the entire country wide open.

593
00:31:42,923 --> 00:31:46,574
Do you know how easily this stuff
could be turned into a weapon?

594
00:31:46,699 --> 00:31:49,708
But now, after this, we'll be ready.

595
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:54,823
That's not your garden
variety crazy person logic.

596
00:31:55,228 --> 00:31:57,878
I'll tell you what.
I'll make you a trade.

597
00:31:58,342 --> 00:32:01,259
Cure for the last vial
of your virus.

598
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,450
Let me see it.

599
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:14,637
Same time.

600
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:18,723
Don't touch me, man.

601
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,088
Is it there?

602
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,582
- Jules, what's going on?
- Shawn, don't come any closer.

603
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:49,799
- Give me that! Give it to me now!
- Idiot!

604
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,414
There isn't enough here
to help anybody.

605
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:55,055
There's gotta be more somewhere.
Just tell me how.

606
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:57,807
- I could save you both.
- Victoria.

607
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:00,482
Who's that?

608
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:02,275
Two hours from here.

609
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:05,229
Too far.

610
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,945
I think it's probable
she contracted it...

611
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,170
In which case, she's gonna
need the antiviral asap.

612
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:30,048
Based on my observations,
I've concluded that mask and gloves

613
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:34,001
will be sufficient
if you decide to enter the dragon.

614
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,180
We need to find out who Mallon was
talking about as he said, "Victoria".

615
00:33:37,603 --> 00:33:40,892
It could be anybody. A girlfriend,
relative, who knows.

616
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:43,460
I got every detective
in the department looking into it.

617
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:46,085
I just hope
whoever it is has the cure.

618
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:51,819
- Victoria's not a person.
- What?

619
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,781
Victoria is a lake. Isn't there
a Lake Victoria around here?

620
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:57,283
A pond, really.
It's about two hours from here.

621
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:59,243
<i>Two hours from here.</i>

622
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:02,789
I used to practice figure skating there
when I was little.

623
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:04,624
I mean, ice hockey.

624
00:34:05,145 --> 00:34:08,367
I'm getting a very strong hit
that he has a place there.

625
00:34:08,492 --> 00:34:11,684
- Let's go check it out.
- Gus, stay with Jules,

626
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:13,608
and call me
if her condition changes.

627
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:14,733
All right.

628
00:34:25,887 --> 00:34:28,646
Apparently Mallon bought
this place about ten years ago.

629
00:34:29,452 --> 00:34:30,696
That makes perfect sense.

630
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:33,601
He stashed a bunch of the cure,
knowing it would be the perfect hideout

631
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:37,448
after he released the virus.
We should... creep around back.

632
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:49,252
Hey, Dirty Harry!

633
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,879
I'm not gonna shoot him.
He doesn't know that.

634
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,673
He doesn't know anything.
He's a dog.

635
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:56,688
- Well, do you have any better ideas?
- Maybe.

636
00:34:59,753 --> 00:35:02,016
Do you still keep
our softball gear in the trunk?

637
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,141
Yeah, why?

638
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,756
Where are you going? Sit!

639
00:35:05,881 --> 00:35:06,686
Sit!

640
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:13,133
- Whatever you do, don't freak out.
- I'm not freaking out.

641
00:35:13,258 --> 00:35:14,694
It's normal if you do.

642
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:16,696
You're the one
who's freaking out, Gus.

643
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:18,848
Yeah, because Thornburg is freaky.

644
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:21,473
But don't worry.
It likes white people.

645
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:25,455
You think Shawn and Lassiter
are having any luck?

646
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:26,895
I know one thing.

647
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,501
If the cure is out there,
Shawn will stop at nothing to find it.

648
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,211
On three.
Three!

649
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:38,942
Go, Lassie! Run like the wind!

650
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,420
- Dude, did you get it?
- What?

651
00:35:53,545 --> 00:35:54,766
Yeah. I got it.

652
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:57,466
- Lassie's running it down to Reidman.
- Nice. Are you okay?

653
00:35:57,591 --> 00:35:58,863
I'm doing great.

654
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,907
I had a life-changing experience.

655
00:36:01,032 --> 00:36:02,805
- What do you mean?
- I was running.

656
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,917
I was being chased
by a very angry Rottweiler

657
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:07,830
wearing catcher's gear
and I had an epiphany.

658
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,208
The Rottweiler
was wearing catcher's gear?

659
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,754
No, Gus, I was wearing the gear.
So I'm running and I realize two things.

660
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:16,923
One, I have a piece
of beef jerky in my pocket.

661
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:19,091
So I grab and I toss it,
and suddenly the dog

662
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,584
doesn't care about me.
Two, I realize...

663
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:25,706
In life we never have as much time
as we think we do.

664
00:36:26,678 --> 00:36:28,766
- What do you mean?
- I mean Jules.

665
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:30,794
All this time, right?
We talk, we do our thing.

666
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:33,662
And I'm like, if something should happen
between us, it will happen.

667
00:36:33,787 --> 00:36:37,437
Like magic beans coming down on me.
But the truth is, my God.

668
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:41,322
She could die today
and she would never know how I feel.

669
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:43,825
So what are you gonna do about it?

670
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,390
I'm gonna do this.

671
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:51,749
Good news, puffy.

672
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:53,376
I heard they got the cure.

673
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:55,681
I hadn't heard that.
It doesn't matter anyway.

674
00:36:55,806 --> 00:36:57,213
She doesn't have Thornburg.

675
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:58,383
Really?

676
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,008
The tests came back negative.
She's got quite an immune system.

677
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,574
That's incredible.

678
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,472
Do you mind
if I'm the first to tell her?

679
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:08,337
- Be my guest.
- Great.

680
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:15,022
- Excuse me, Shawn.
- Not now, Gus.

681
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:16,322
Just a minute.

682
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:19,402
Can it wait? I'm about to tell Juliet
something important.

683
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:21,487
Go to the cafeteria
and get her some jell-o?

684
00:37:21,662 --> 00:37:23,014
- Shawn.
- Please!

685
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:25,789
I've gotta get through this,
man, come on.

686
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,331
There are things that you need to know,
and I have to say them.

687
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,500
You don't have the Thornburg virus.

688
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,836
- What?
- What? Are you kidding?

689
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,337
Dr. Reidman just told me.

690
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:43,634
- Oh, my God!
- You have more time than you thought.

691
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:44,760
Oh, my God!

692
00:37:47,878 --> 00:37:49,331
I am so happy.

693
00:37:49,456 --> 00:37:52,767
I am not going to die
in this disgusting robe.

694
00:37:52,994 --> 00:37:54,944
That's so... That is so good!

695
00:37:55,913 --> 00:37:58,944
But I still want to say
what I was gonna say,

696
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:00,319
If that's okay.

697
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:04,179
Sure.

698
00:38:07,723 --> 00:38:09,523
How do I want to say this?

699
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:11,704
You know how when we were kids,

700
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:14,498
there were all those cool prizes
at the bottom of cereal boxes?

701
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:20,000
There are two kinds of kids.
There's the kid who flipped the box over

702
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:22,965
and opened it from the bottom
and grabbed the prize right away.

703
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,885
And then there was the kid
who waited patiently

704
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:28,200
and ate bowl after bowl of cereal

705
00:38:28,971 --> 00:38:31,721
until the prize
just tumbled out on its own.

706
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:35,645
There's also a third kid named Mikey
who will eat anything,

707
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:38,550
including the prize.
He's not really important right now.

708
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:40,483
And?

709
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:43,123
I didn't wait.
I didn't wait for my decoder ring

710
00:38:43,248 --> 00:38:47,188
or my Frankenberry action
figure when I was a kid. So...

711
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,788
what am I waiting for now?

712
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,410
All I know is that I don't want
to miss out on the prize.

713
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:59,751
What are you trying to say, Shawn?

714
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,382
That I...

715
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,811
I don't know.

716
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,603
I heard the good news.

717
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,603
Come here.

718
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:20,691
Sorry.

719
00:39:22,888 --> 00:39:24,736
- Sorry. Too much?
- A little bit.

720
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,600
- Just don't say anything.
- I wasn't.

721
00:39:40,618 --> 00:39:42,218
I heard you were here.

722
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:43,878
Donny.
How are you, man?

723
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:46,298
Good. No, more than good
thanks to you guys.

724
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,533
You thankis us for the quarantine?

725
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:52,501
Because get this,
while I was back there,

726
00:39:52,626 --> 00:39:54,515
I met a girl.

727
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:58,503
No, don't be silly.

728
00:39:58,628 --> 00:40:02,565
This one is completely different.
She just got here from Russia.

729
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:06,409
There's a little bit
of a language barrier,

730
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:08,487
but she is so sweet, you know?

731
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:12,241
And apparently she only works nights.
So clearly I'm fired.

732
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,201
We can now spend
all our days together,

733
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:17,021
and she's already
talking about moving in.

734
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:22,652
Have you considered the possibility
that this girl could be using you?

735
00:40:23,344 --> 00:40:24,344
Using me?

736
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:27,965
- Shawn, I hardly think so.
- You got your watch back, right?

737
00:40:29,203 --> 00:40:30,453
So where is it?

738
00:40:39,227 --> 00:40:40,577
Good luck, Donny.

739
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:52,210
Great news. All the patients were
released with a clean bill of health.

740
00:40:52,335 --> 00:40:55,743
And here you go.
Professionally dry cleaned.

741
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:58,370
This is what you do
when you borrow someone's clothes.

742
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:02,416
This should be wrinkled and stinky.

743
00:41:02,965 --> 00:41:05,150
Are you still obsessing
over the Juliet thing?

744
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:07,171
Yes, you are.

745
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:09,969
Look, let's go check out
The Sydney J. Furie film festival.

746
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:12,680
I'm talking <i>iron eagle II</i>,
<i>lady sings the blues</i>,

747
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:13,929
<i>and iron eagle IV</i>.

748
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:18,678
If <i>the taking of Beverly Hills</i>
is included,

749
00:41:19,803 --> 00:41:21,310
- count me in.
- Steve!

750
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,938
What are you and your porn'stache
doing here in our office?

751
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:26,453
- A deal is a deal.
- It is, indeed.

752
00:41:26,686 --> 00:41:28,984
- What are you talking about?
- I am not leaving here

753
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:31,188
without your DNA.

754
00:41:33,015 --> 00:41:34,193
Right...

755
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,189
I did say that I would...

756
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:40,371
You're in luck.
I just drank about a liter of teas' tea.

757
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:46,752
Let's take
some measurements of that dome.

758
00:41:47,032 --> 00:41:48,532
- What?
- Shall we?

759
00:41:49,197 --> 00:41:50,247
Hold still.
