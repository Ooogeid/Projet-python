1
00:00:01,186 --> 00:00:02,544
It was an ordinary day...

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,779
It's almost 3:00.
Let's do this thing.

3
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:06,803
There were nine of us...

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,833
Most of us strangers.

5
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,425
We all ended up in the bank.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,569
All for different reasons.

7
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:17,650
- And then in an instant...
- Now.

8
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:19,394
- Our lives changed.
- Aah !

9
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,226
This will all be over in five minutes.

10
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:22,893
52 hours later

11
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:24,447
...we came out of there

12
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:26,098
no longer strangers,

13
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:30,538
bonded forever
by what we went through.

14
00:00:30,886 --> 00:00:32,550
What happened in there ?

15
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:34,843
Only we know for now.

16
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:38,221
<i>Previously on The Nine...</i>

17
00:00:38,427 --> 00:00:39,963
<i>Get down ! Get down !</i>

18
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:41,843
<i>Don't shoot ! I'm unarmed !</i>

19
00:00:41,987 --> 00:00:44,510
<i>- I'm the cop ! I'm the cop !</i>
<i>- Please help her. please !</i>

20
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:46,102
<i>- Stay with me, Eva.</i>
<i>- This is her father.</i>

21
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:47,251
<i>What is happening ?</i>

22
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:48,971
<i>It's okay, honey. He'll be right out.</i>

23
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:52,280
<i>We're gonna nail these bastards.</i>

24
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:53,910
<i>They're never gonna see</i>
<i>the light of day again.</i>

25
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:55,603
<i>No one was supposed to get hurt.</i>

26
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,033
<i>Where's the negotiator ?</i>

27
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:00,841
<i>Well, clearly, you're not happy</i>
<i>about some of our decisions.</i>

28
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:02,993
<i>You go public with that,</i>
<i>we'll go right at your credibility.</i>

29
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:04,553
<i>- Do you want to talk about it ?</i>
<i>- About what ?</i>

30
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:05,812
<i>About what happened in there.</i>

31
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:07,820
<i>Daddy, I don't remember anything.</i>

32
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:09,892
<i>What happened to her in there ?</i>

33
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,643
<i>Eva's dead. She died.</i>

34
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:14,361
<i>Look, she wouldn't have been alive</i>
<i>as long as she was if it wasn't for you.</i>

35
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:17,473
<i>I'm in trouble.</i>

36
00:01:17,637 --> 00:01:18,613
<i>Maybe.</i>

37
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:21,173
<i>- You were going to tell me something.</i>
<i>- I'm pregnant.</i>

38
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:22,812
<i>You never said anything, I mean,</i>

39
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:24,711
<i>the whole time that we were in the bank.</i>

40
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:27,143
<i>Nick, everything would've</i>
<i>gone down a lot worse</i>

41
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,542
<i>if you hadn't have been there.</i>

42
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,632
<i>If you want to make an issue</i>
<i>about what happened on the outside,</i>

43
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:32,931
<i>- I'll back you up.</i>
<i>- That's not gonna be so simple for you.</i>

44
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:35,102
<i>- How's it feel to be a hero ?</i>
<i>- A hero ?</i>

45
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:36,601
<i>Why would you do that, Egan ?</i>

46
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:38,381
<i>Risk your life for people</i>
<i>you don't even know ?</i>

47
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:41,182
<i>Egan and I organized</i>
<i>a get together tonight.</i>

48
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:43,270
<i>You know, we shouldn't lose contact.</i>

49
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:44,972
<i>Everybody came.</i>

50
00:01:45,307 --> 00:01:46,723
<i>Hey, where's Felicia ?</i>

51
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,512
<i>Hi.</i>

52
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:55,472
<i>This will all be over in five minutes.</i>

53
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:01,903
<i>Your gun...</i>

54
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:03,151
Hour 1 - 3:06 PM

55
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:04,520
On the floor, slowly.

56
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:05,842
Nobody gets hurt here.

57
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:08,590
Everybody, hands up !

58
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,823
That means you, now !

59
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:13,160
Kick it over.

60
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:17,152
Get over here now.
Come on !

61
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:22,252
You two pretty little ladies,
outta there !

62
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:24,360
And do not even think

63
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:27,042
about touching those alarm buttons.

64
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:31,450
You ! Away from the door.

65
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:32,602
We can't. It's locked.

66
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:34,753
Come on. Let's go, gorgeous.

67
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:36,110
You...

68
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:37,500
Lift up his pant legs.

69
00:02:37,648 --> 00:02:39,023
It's okay.
We're gonna be okay.

70
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:40,670
- Move it, lady !
- Okay, okay.

71
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:43,421
- Come on !
- Okay, okay. I'm... I'm moving.

72
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:46,071
Over there.

73
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:50,642
You two, over there.

74
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:53,130
Let's go. Let's go !

75
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:56,032
Higher.

76
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:57,711
That was my only gun.

77
00:02:58,797 --> 00:02:59,952
He's clean.

78
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,081
All right, get up.

79
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:03,412
You're making a big mistake here,
robbing a bank

80
00:03:03,536 --> 00:03:04,522
- with a cop inside. 
- Oh, yeah ?

81
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,273
- Don't.
- If you get out of here right now,

82
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:07,991
you've barely even committed a felony.

83
00:03:08,157 --> 00:03:09,480
- Stop, stop.
- Shut up. Shut up !

84
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:10,703
Just do what he says.

85
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:12,781
Well, I appreciate your concern, ma'am,
but we got the cameras covered.

86
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:14,141
As far as a felony...

87
00:03:15,516 --> 00:03:17,310
How's that, huh ?

88
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,981
I need your cell phones.

89
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:22,681
Dump 'em on the floor, all of you.

90
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:25,803
Where's your phone ?

91
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:27,233
What the hell is that ?

92
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:28,603
I don't know.

93
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:30,760
You don't know why your sleeve is blue ?

94
00:03:31,217 --> 00:03:33,802
Hey ! Come on. You don't have to do that.

95
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:36,490
Look, he just went to the bathroom.

96
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:38,180
Maybe it got wet in there.

97
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:40,010
It's all right, Mr. Foote. Just,

98
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:43,141
try to explain whatever... went on.

99
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:47,942
I... I dropped my wedding ring
in the toilet.

100
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:49,571
How the hell did you do that ?

101
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,391
I was gonna flush it and
I changed my mind.

102
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,820
All right, let's get on with this.

103
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:55,222
- Who's in charge here ? 
- I am.

104
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:56,803
Take me to the vault.

105
00:03:57,047 --> 00:03:58,063
I just have to get my keys.

106
00:03:58,288 --> 00:03:59,332
- Now ! 
- They're in my desk.

107
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:00,590
All right !

108
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:03,670
Everybody else down on the floor

109
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:05,552
on your stomachs.

110
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:07,781
- This will be over in five minutes.
- Okay.

111
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,941
Are you all right ?

112
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:43,851
Follow me.

113
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:48,013
11 days later.

114
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:19,492
Hi.

115
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,213
Hi.

116
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:26,613
You're not that surprised to see me.

117
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:28,533
Nothing would surprise me 
at this point.

118
00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:30,600
So you're okay that I'm here ?

119
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:33,803
Not like I get a lot of visitors.

120
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:37,493
It's a pretty big story, you know ?

121
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,141
All of this.

122
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:42,022
Not exactly what I had in mind.

123
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:44,952
So I guess there's gonna 
be a trial, huh ?

124
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:47,852
A big one, looks like.

125
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:49,643
Do you have a good lawyer ?

126
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,590
We'll see.

127
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:56,953
I hear they're keeping your brother 
at the same hospital

128
00:05:57,215 --> 00:05:58,983
where Jeremy and Lizzie work. I guess...

129
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,203
that it was the closest one to the bank.

130
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:02,971
Why are you here ?

131
00:06:03,178 --> 00:06:04,962
I've been thinking about it, you know ?

132
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:08,450
Everything that... 
happened in there, and...

133
00:06:08,695 --> 00:06:10,402
Yeah, well, try not to think too much.

134
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,131
Just get back to your life. 
Forget about me.

135
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:14,360
- But please, I just... 
- Forget about me, Felicia.

136
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:16,172
And don't come back here.

137
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,322
No. No, Lucas.

138
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:30,240
The Bloc Team presents to you
The Nine - Episode 2 - Heroes Welcome

139
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,850
Well, it was a great idea,
getting together.

140
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:35,923
And a great place.

141
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:38,103
- My fries were kinda cold. 
- Yeah, yeah.

142
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,231
So, uh, same time next week ?

143
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:42,090
- Oh, sure. 
- Sure.

144
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,217
Yeah.

145
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:46,258
- All right. 
- Come on. Let's go, kiddo.

146
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,678
Oh, I'm telling you, I'm fine.

147
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:49,861
I had, like, two margaritas 
three hours ago.

148
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:53,360
- Young lady, I am driving you home. 
Understood ? 
- Fine.

149
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:55,142
Good night, everybody.

150
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:56,453
- Good night.
- Good night.

151
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:58,523
Night.

152
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:02,102
- You haven't told him yet ? 
- No.

153
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:05,903
I hate to break it to you, 
but you're not gonna be able 
to hide it much longer.

154
00:07:06,946 --> 00:07:08,321
Walk you to your car ?

155
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:09,720
Sure.

156
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:10,882
Night, everybody.

157
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:12,620
- Night. 
- Night.

158
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:14,920
You still have some stuff 
at my place.

159
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:16,562
Yeah, my guitar.

160
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:19,523
Yeah, a few t-shirts, tennis racket...

161
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:23,311
Your first edition unbearable 
lightness of being.

162
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,653
You want me to bring it in 
to work for you ?

163
00:07:26,857 --> 00:07:28,472
Did you come here with Franny ?

164
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:30,982
Did I... ? No.

165
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,391
No.

166
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,270
We bumped into each other out front.

167
00:07:34,448 --> 00:07:36,172
It's okay if you did.

168
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:37,961
I thought it was good 
that she wasn't alone.

169
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:39,481
No, we didn't.

170
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:40,991
Okay.

171
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,312
So are we done ?

172
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:47,092
I need some time to think

173
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:48,272
about a lot of things.

174
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:49,940
Two years...

175
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:53,740
Two years, and we just flush it 
down the drain with barely
a conversation.

176
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:56,393
I just said I need 
some time to think.

177
00:07:56,995 --> 00:07:58,171
Right.

178
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:01,331
Well, you know where to find me.

179
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:02,600
Yeah.

180
00:08:02,797 --> 00:08:04,141
Safe drive.

181
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:10,171
So the department wants 
to make you their mascot.

182
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:12,633
I prefer "poster boy".

183
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:15,731
It makes sense... Pin a medal on you 
and put you out front.

184
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,793
The department gets some good P.R.

185
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:21,290
It certainly helps take the stink 
off of how they handled things

186
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:23,051
And keeps my mouth shut.

187
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:27,050
I know it's kinda slimy, 
the way they're dealing 
with things, but...

188
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:29,651
You do deserve a medal,

189
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,370
or a promotion or,

190
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:33,070
whatever else you might 
want from them.

191
00:08:33,257 --> 00:08:35,220
Two people are dead.

192
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,760
One of 'em was shot with my gun.

193
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:42,423
There was nothing that 
you could've done about Eva.

194
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:53,310
I should go.

195
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:55,322
Uh, get some sleep.

196
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:26,800
Everybody say yeah !

197
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,243
- Say yeah ! 
- Good morning, Los Angeles,

198
00:09:30,596 --> 00:09:32,412
and welcome to "The L.A. morning show".

199
00:09:32,757 --> 00:09:35,141
And a fantastic morning it is, isn't it ?

200
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:42,863
It's great out,

201
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:44,770
and we've got a great lineup, 
starting with

202
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,803
the unlikely hero from 
last week's fidelity

203
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:49,052
republic bank hostage standoff.

204
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:52,562
Please welcome a very 
brave man : Egan Foote.

205
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:59,100
- So, Egan... 
- Yes.

206
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:00,993
- Egan. 
- That's me.

207
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,310
The moment that we've 
all been waiting for.

208
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:06,410
You've been trapped in 
the bank for over two days,

209
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:09,302
the S.W.A.T. team comes 
busting in, and you...

210
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:11,740
you manage to take down 
your brutal captor

211
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:14,002
- Randall Reese.
- That's right.

212
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:15,700
How did you do that ?

213
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:17,323
Well, carpe diem, Josh.

214
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:19,393
The day was there, and I seized it.

215
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,923
And you almost took a bullet 
from S.W.A.T. in the process.

216
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:24,202
Uh, uh, lucky, I guess. 
I came out of it with a...

217
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:27,202
slight concussion 
and a new lease on life.

218
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:30,460
Ricky, breakfast is ready. 
Now come to the table.

219
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:33,690
Let's... let's go back a minute 
to how the whole thing began,

220
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:35,340
because we understand that

221
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:38,381
a 9-1-1 call came 
from with inside the bank.

222
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:41,633
Uh, well, it began with 
two men wanting to rob the bank.

223
00:10:41,857 --> 00:10:43,003
Right, but the standoff,

224
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:44,881
that happened because 9-1-1 was called

225
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,253
and then the police showed up.

226
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:47,311
Yeah, that's right.

227
00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:49,983
And then all hell broke 
loose from there.

228
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:53,380
- Please help my sister ! 
- Hey, get off me !

229
00:10:53,638 --> 00:10:55,330
- Ricky, come on. 
- Yeah, essentially.

230
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:57,650
So if you were in 
a situation like that again...

231
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,773
- Uh, heaven forbid... 
- Have sharon draw up

232
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:01,952
a motion in limine to keep 
the mother's statement out.

233
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:03,343
Here's the cummins' complaint.

234
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:05,720
Make sure that it's filed today. 
Thank you.

235
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:07,601
'cause, you know, there's 
a lot of speculation

236
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,543
about how the police 
and the FBI may have

237
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:11,573
- mismanaged the situation. 
- Do you want me to draft...

238
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:12,743
Hang on a second.

239
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:16,292
You're someone who saw 
everything that went on inside.

240
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:18,051
What's your position on that ?

241
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:19,971
Well, I'm no expert on police procedure,

242
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,541
but as far as I can tell, um...

243
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:25,711
Well, let's just say, 
it seemed like they could've
handled it a lot differently.

244
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:27,552
Better, I mean.

245
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,730
And what about the cop 
who was inside with you ?

246
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:32,510
Nick Cavanaugh was, uh,

247
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,982
a hero in there.

248
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:37,181
Without him, I don't know how 
we would've gotten through it.

249
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:39,943
- Sounds like you two are close. 
- We all are now.

250
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:41,730
Come on !

251
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:43,453
Nobody gets hurt here.

252
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:51,670
So you all right ?

253
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:53,122
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

254
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:55,481
Well, last night must have 
been a good warm-up for you.

255
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:57,142
The party, you know, 
seeing all your friends.

256
00:11:57,346 --> 00:11:58,503
Oh, yeah. I guess.

257
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:00,163
Listen, honey, if you can't handle it,

258
00:12:00,396 --> 00:12:01,650
you just say the word, I'll take you home.

259
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:03,660
No, dad, seriously, I gotta 
do this sooner or later.

260
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,842
All right ?

261
00:12:05,106 --> 00:12:06,260
That's my girl.

262
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,993
All right, I love you, sweetheart.

263
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:09,803
- You be good now. 
- See you later.

264
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:23,563
Morning.

265
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:26,763
Frank Waters, 43,

266
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,643
severe cardiomyopathy.

267
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,210
He's been on a pump

268
00:12:30,238 --> 00:12:32,140
for two months waiting 
for a transplant.

269
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:34,601
U.N.O.S. found a match 
yesterday in San Diego.

270
00:12:34,827 --> 00:12:37,591
The transplant should take 
about ten hours, so...

271
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:40,521
His wife is going to need 
some hand-holding today.

272
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,683
Where's Frank now ?

273
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:43,281
I.C.U.

274
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:51,533
Have you... been up there yet ?

275
00:12:51,798 --> 00:12:54,681
I mean, since Randall's been up there.

276
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:56,403
No. You ?

277
00:12:57,405 --> 00:12:58,763
No.

278
00:13:08,197 --> 00:13:09,460
Hey, Tessa.

279
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,880
This is our social 
worker Lizzie Miller.

280
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:14,991
How's he doing ?

281
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:16,410
Um, okay.

282
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,793
He's a... a bit scared,

283
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:18,623
I think.

284
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:20,873
Well, that... that's to be expected.

285
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:23,671
Uh, let me talk to you... 
what has to happen now, okay ?

286
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:31,072
Lizzie.

287
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:33,673
Lizzie, you coming ?

288
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:39,363
But that is the thing 
about facing your fears.

289
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:40,692
Seriously.

290
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:43,510
Well, it's been great having 
you here on the show, Egan.

291
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:45,393
Thank you so much. And before...

292
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:46,670
you get back to your life,

293
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:49,670
we understand that there's one 
more thing you'd like to say

294
00:13:49,908 --> 00:13:51,160
to our audience at home.

295
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,990
Yes, uh, thank you.

296
00:13:53,795 --> 00:13:56,093
Well, um....

297
00:13:57,398 --> 00:14:00,372
Well, you see, there was, um...

298
00:14:00,617 --> 00:14:03,261
There was one of us... 
Her name was Eva Rios...

299
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:05,841
And she didn't make it 
out of there. She was killed.

300
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,843
And she left behind a little boy... Ricky.

301
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:08,830
He's 6 years old.

302
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:10,031
His father's in prison.

303
00:14:10,395 --> 00:14:12,273
His aunt Franny... 
She was in there with us, too...

304
00:14:12,488 --> 00:14:14,232
Now she's gotta raise him on her own.

305
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:16,140
They don't have very much money.

306
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:19,120
And, uh, Eva didn't work at 
the bank long enough to

307
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,832
have any pension or

308
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:23,320
life insurance money or anything, so...

309
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:27,041
I'm asking those of you 
at home who may have an extra 
$5 or $10 to please

310
00:14:27,276 --> 00:14:30,261
call this number and, 
um, make a donation.

311
00:14:38,147 --> 00:14:39,641
Hey, Mark.

312
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:41,331
You get a hit on that plate 
I asked you to run ?

313
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:42,421
Just came in.

314
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:43,711
It's a federal plate.

315
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:44,913
Bureau, actually.

316
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:46,963
What's this about ?

317
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:48,940
You've come to a decision I hope.

318
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,691
Not quite.

319
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,682
You got any idea why the FBI 
might be tailing me ?

320
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:55,152
I imagine they want 
to pressure you,

321
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:56,720
otherwise, you never 
would've made them.

322
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:57,990
Pressure me ?

323
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,752
Everybody wants you to step up, Nick.

324
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:01,781
Take one for the team.

325
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:06,391
The FBI can't exactly put 
their negotiator out front 
for the photo-ops.

326
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:07,472
They'll settle for you.

327
00:15:07,726 --> 00:15:08,770
So what's next, bugging my phone,

328
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:10,432
burning a cross on my lawn, what ?

329
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:12,542
- No, just an extra request. 
- What's that ?

330
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:15,693
The department would like 
to set up something for you 
at city hall.

331
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:16,993
The commissioner will be there,

332
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:19,261
someone from the FBI, 
the D.A.'s office.

333
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:20,341
You'll get your medal

334
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:21,861
and your promotion...

335
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:24,663
And you'll also say a few words

336
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,551
about how proud you are 
of the job everybody did.

337
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:29,683
P.R. department typed up 
something for you.

338
00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:32,600
You can tweak it a bit, 
but you get the gist.

339
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:37,120
So this isn't just about me 
keeping my trap shut.

340
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,791
I gotta be your mouthpiece now.

341
00:15:40,978 --> 00:15:43,032
This is an easy choice, Nick.

342
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:52,702
You're right.

343
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:00,680
I quit.

344
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:09,371
So guess what I came up with.

345
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,213
An expert witness for 
the McManus hearing ?

346
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,133
- Close. 
- Hmm.

347
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:15,180
A hearsay exception 
for the holloway trial ?

348
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:16,342
Not holloway.

349
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:18,052
Hollywood, as in bowl,

350
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:20,252
as in garden box for Elvis Costello.

351
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:21,262
Tonight ?

352
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:22,650
Backstage passes.

353
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:23,873
You're good.

354
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:25,573
- I've been told. 
- Kathryn.

355
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:27,573
I have Nick Cavanaugh on the phone.

356
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,901
- We got to prep for Petrocelli. 
- All right, I'll be right there.

357
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:33,101
- Line two. 
- Thank you.

358
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:38,063
- Hey, there. 
- I quit my job.

359
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:39,721
What happened ?

360
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:41,773
A fed tailed me to 
the diner last night.

361
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:43,191
I spotted him after you left.

362
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:44,290
The feds ?

363
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:45,660
They're trying to bully me.

364
00:16:45,936 --> 00:16:47,301
They want me to get out 
in front of the cameras

365
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:49,093
and say that everything 
they did was all right.

366
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,500
So you quit ? 
What are you gonna do now ?

367
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:51,690
Go after them.

368
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:54,270
- The cops ? The feds ? 
- Everybody.

369
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:55,720
Are you still there ?

370
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:57,811
Yeah, yeah. I'm just, um...

371
00:16:58,658 --> 00:16:59,920
I'm just taking it in.

372
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:02,232
Somebody has got 
to pay for what happened.

373
00:17:02,475 --> 00:17:04,842
Lucas and randall will pay. 
Isn't that enough ?

374
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,201
Is that enough for you ?

375
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:08,440
Look, I...

376
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:11,040
I know what I said

377
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:13,333
at the funeral. It's just, um...

378
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:18,121
I'm trying to move forward.

379
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,600
Well, things happened 
in that bank that involve you.

380
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:22,303
If I talk to the press,

381
00:17:22,596 --> 00:17:23,950
to whoever, they're 
gonna come to you.

382
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:26,262
I just want to know 
what I'm up against.

383
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:28,270
Am I alone in this ?

384
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:33,730
Fine. I get it.

385
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:34,990
Time to move on.

386
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,841
Nick.

387
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:50,583
Can you tell me your name ?

388
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:52,130
My name's Tom.

389
00:17:55,935 --> 00:17:57,392
You know you're not 
supposed to be in here.

390
00:17:57,558 --> 00:17:59,072
I know. I...

391
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:00,431
How's Frank doing ?

392
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:03,401
Okay considering he's about 
to undergo a heart transplant.

393
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:05,020
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry

394
00:18:05,186 --> 00:18:06,481
I freaked out this morning,

395
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:09,020
- left you alone with them. 
- It's fine.

396
00:18:09,316 --> 00:18:12,162
You know, I'm not as bad 
with the patients as you think.

397
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:18,043
I wish Randall was dead.

398
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:22,080
You just gotta put your head 
down and do your thing.

399
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:24,850
They're waiting for me.

400
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:28,053
Thank you so much for coming in.

401
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:30,201
We'll let you know one way 
or the other next week.

402
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:31,233
Excuse me, Malcolm.

403
00:18:31,517 --> 00:18:32,532
Yes.

404
00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:34,572
I have Tom's last check here.

405
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:36,500
Should I just send it 
to his home or...

406
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,921
Um, no, his wife wants us 
to deposit that directly.

407
00:18:38,937 --> 00:18:40,391
Thank you.

408
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,503
Franny.

409
00:18:50,947 --> 00:18:52,663
What are you doing out here ?

410
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:54,873
Uh, I came by...

411
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,711
I wanted to thank you

412
00:18:57,006 --> 00:18:59,271
for organizing the fund with Egan.

413
00:18:59,508 --> 00:19:01,172
I wanted to come inside, but...

414
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,041
I can't.

415
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:05,401
I thought I would try, you know ?

416
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,680
But...

417
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:08,992
I can't.

418
00:19:09,226 --> 00:19:10,943
Well, you don't have to rush.

419
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:12,751
There'll always be 
a job for you here.

420
00:19:12,966 --> 00:19:14,671
No. Actually, I don't...

421
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:17,560
I don't think I'll ever 
be able to go in there.

422
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:20,343
Okay. well, I'll, um,

423
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:21,632
I'll write you a reference,

424
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,380
and I'll make whatever 
calls you need.

425
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:25,323
Oh, uh, I never finished processing

426
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:27,090
that mortgage application 
for the Malones.

427
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:28,590
It's still in my drawer.

428
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:30,381
It's under the P.O. forms.

429
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:32,783
I really wanted to do that, 
you know ?

430
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:36,242
I... I really appreciate 
you giving me a chance.

431
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,752
You always gave me a chance.

432
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:39,331
You always deserved it.

433
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,680
Well, thanks.

434
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:41,933
Listen, I'll tell you what,

435
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:43,713
Why don't I go inside 
and I'll get your things,

436
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:44,823
okay ?

437
00:19:51,238 --> 00:19:52,460
Eva, no !

438
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:02,173
What ?

439
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:04,180
Monica Turner from the Times.

440
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:05,860
Okay, thanks.

441
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:11,371
Monica.

442
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:13,292
Kathyrn, how's it going ?

443
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,653
Good, fine. Just getting back 
into the swing of things. 
What's up ?

444
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:18,850
Well, I'm not sure if there's 
a conflict of interest here,

445
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:20,781
but just wanted 
to feel it out with you.

446
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:21,931
Go ahead.

447
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,773
I got a tip about Nick Cavanaugh.

448
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:24,961
Yeah ?

449
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:29,140
Apparently, the bank teller 
Eva Rios was shot with his gun.

450
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:31,400
And I'm also hearing 
he was a problem in there...

451
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:33,263
Butting heads with the negotiator,

452
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:35,330
impeding the police 
in his own department

453
00:20:35,497 --> 00:20:36,980
and the FBI.

454
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:38,502
Is there any truth to that ?

455
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:40,290
Where are you getting 
this information from ?

456
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,970
You know I can't tell you that.

457
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:43,861
Is someone on the department 
leaking it to you ?

458
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:45,631
Is it true ?

459
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:51,313
Let me call you back,

460
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:53,541
and don't do anything 
until you hear from me.

461
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:55,153
Okay.

462
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:12,743
Cavanaugh.

463
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:15,093
I'm with you.

464
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,053
So how's Randall doing ?

465
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:22,410
The doctors say he'll be 
out of I.C.U. tomorrow.

466
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:24,051
They're calling him Rasputin

467
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:26,420
- down at the D.A.'s office. 
- Funny.

468
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,160
Well, they can 
joke all they want.

469
00:21:28,316 --> 00:21:29,470
We need him to live.

470
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:31,202
Why is that ?

471
00:21:31,388 --> 00:21:33,202
Well, if he dies, the prosecution

472
00:21:33,396 --> 00:21:35,181
will try to pin everything on you.

473
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:38,043
Which doesn't go so much 
with my plan to pin everything on him.

474
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:39,982
I told you the 
robbery was my idea.

475
00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:42,410
And we will deal with the 
robbery as a distinct issue.

476
00:21:42,645 --> 00:21:45,271
I'm trying to get you off 
on the felony murder charges.

477
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,320
- You do want that, right ? 
- Obviously.

478
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:52,310
Well, we're gonna need
to put some hostages on the stand.

479
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:55,133
Will any of them 
testify on your behalf ?

480
00:21:55,195 --> 00:21:56,691
I don't know.

481
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:58,633
What about the Jones girl ?

482
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:00,990
- Felicia is it ? 
- What about her ?

483
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:03,362
I heard she visited 
you last night.

484
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:06,242
Juries love sweet, 
teenage faces.

485
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,322
You stay away from her.

486
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:09,242
- Lucas... 
- No, I mean it.

487
00:22:09,476 --> 00:22:10,960
I know you think 
I'm gonna be your O.J.,

488
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:12,602
but you go anywhere near her,

489
00:22:12,636 --> 00:22:14,133
I'll fire you and go back 
with the public defender.

490
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:16,342
Got it ?

491
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:39,072
I'm not just talking about making 
it easier for the customer.

492
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:41,240
I'm talking about making it 
more fulfilling for us.

493
00:22:41,456 --> 00:22:42,882
Corporate will never 
go for it, Egan.

494
00:22:43,086 --> 00:22:44,321
What do you mean, 
"Corporate will never go for it ?"

495
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,302
How do you know 
until we've tried ?

496
00:22:46,586 --> 00:22:49,083
I don't remember calling 
a staff meeting.

497
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:54,630
No, I... I was just, uh...

498
00:22:54,776 --> 00:22:56,092
pitching...

499
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:57,782
Some of my new 
ideas to everybody.

500
00:22:58,036 --> 00:23:00,802
Really ? And what are those ?

501
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:03,612
Really ? Well, all right, 
for starters, um...

502
00:23:03,847 --> 00:23:06,881
A paper-free, internet-based system

503
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,440
that tracks insurance 
claims in real time.

504
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:10,701
Paper-free ?

505
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,912
Yeah, now we'd have some 
cash outlay for computer

506
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,102
hardware up front,

507
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:15,602
but it would pay for itself

508
00:23:15,616 --> 00:23:17,690
in increased efficiency, 
not to mention save us from...

509
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:19,811
from drowning in 
pointless triplicate forms.

510
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:21,430
Don't leave out the most 
important part, Egan.

511
00:23:21,497 --> 00:23:23,113
Yes, good. Thank you. Yeah.

512
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:24,600
It would keep sick people

513
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:26,602
from having to haggle 
for their money all day

514
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,981
when they should be worried 
about their treatment.

515
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:30,403
Well...

516
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:33,151
I think it's a great idea, Egan,

517
00:23:33,348 --> 00:23:36,181
except for one small problem.

518
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:37,502
Okay, what's that ?

519
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:38,923
The inefficiency,

520
00:23:39,188 --> 00:23:40,392
as you call it,

521
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:42,711
is how we make our profit.

522
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:44,911
Without it, you're out of a job,

523
00:23:45,137 --> 00:23:48,930
which you'll all be anyway 
if you don't get back to work.

524
00:23:49,118 --> 00:23:50,270
And, Egan...

525
00:23:51,288 --> 00:23:52,501
Yeah.

526
00:23:52,737 --> 00:23:54,840
You got any more appearances 
I should know about ?

527
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:57,982
Because I need you here on time.

528
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:06,092
He's just a jerk.

529
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:09,781
It's fine.

530
00:24:10,376 --> 00:24:11,640
Just an idea.

531
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:13,071
Hey !

532
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:14,751
It's taco Tuesday 
at the cafeteria.

533
00:24:14,868 --> 00:24:16,271
You down ?

534
00:24:16,465 --> 00:24:18,043
I'll be there in a minute.

535
00:24:19,698 --> 00:24:20,962
Saline.

536
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:23,371
I need suction.

537
00:24:24,165 --> 00:24:25,181
Okay.

538
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:27,172
That does it for the atrial walls,

539
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,961
superior and inferior vena cavaes 
and the pulmonary artery.

540
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:32,170
We'll fix the aorta, 
prep the paddles

541
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:34,672
and get this baby humming. 
Let me have a 4-0 prolene.

542
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:37,712
I said a 4-0, Terry.

543
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:40,572
This is an aortic anastomosis, 
not your stitch-and-bitch group.

544
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:42,621
Guess some people never change.

545
00:24:45,577 --> 00:24:47,932
And this plan of yours,

546
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,493
this is at what point in the standoff ?

547
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:51,271
About halfway through it.

548
00:24:51,486 --> 00:24:53,142
After reese had killed 
the security guard

549
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,471
and it was clear that 
negotiations were going nowhere.

550
00:24:55,646 --> 00:24:56,833
I just want to make clear

551
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,033
that Nick offehimself 
as a sole hostage.

552
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:01,992
He had Reese and Dalton 
convinced that they were 
gonna make it out of there.

553
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:04,471
- This plan would've worked.
- Right.

554
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:06,302
Now about the security guard,

555
00:25:06,575 --> 00:25:08,740
is it true that you had 
an opportunity to get him out,

556
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,712
- but that your mother was released ? 
- Now that was protocol, Monica.

557
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:12,873
The man was wounded.

558
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:14,932
He was conscious and alert.

559
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,493
Dalton wouldn't have 
allowed it anyway.

560
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,631
By the way, the real question is...

561
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:21,483
Why negotiations broke down 
so badly that Nick

562
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:23,421
had to be the one to deal with it on the inside.

563
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:24,833
Hello, Monica. 
Good to see you.

564
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:26,431
Deputee District Attorney.

565
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:27,802
Nick.

566
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:30,062
Kathryn, can I borrow you 
for a second ?

567
00:25:30,256 --> 00:25:32,352
Yeah, sure. Excuse me.

568
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:38,212
- What are you doing here ? 
- Walls have ears, Kat.

569
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:39,633
The question is 
what are you doing here ?

570
00:25:39,675 --> 00:25:41,382
- Helping a friend. 
- Helping him do what ?

571
00:25:41,686 --> 00:25:44,361
Make our case against
Dalton and Reese more difficult 
by casting the cops as bad guys ?

572
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:46,010
Saying that the cops 
on the outside screwed up

573
00:25:46,026 --> 00:25:47,703
shouldn't hurt your case 
if you do your job right.

574
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:49,950
But I appreciate your concern 
for your career.

575
00:25:50,078 --> 00:25:51,602
Well, it might do you some good 
to think about your own.

576
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:53,001
Look, if you side with him,

577
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:55,341
you will alienate everyone 
in the L.A.P.D and the FBI,

578
00:25:55,618 --> 00:25:57,592
not to mention quite 
a few people in your own office.

579
00:25:57,828 --> 00:25:59,632
And you can certainly kiss 
any political aspirations

580
00:25:59,797 --> 00:26:01,113
you have good-bye. 
That'll be gone.

581
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:02,343
They were gonna throw 
him to the wolves.

582
00:26:02,616 --> 00:26:04,020
I didn't have a choice.

583
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:05,931
Look, I know what 
you went through together.

584
00:26:06,146 --> 00:26:08,313
No, I don't think you do.

585
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:11,612
Kat, hey,

586
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:14,732
I understand you feel you owe 
him in some way, okay ?

587
00:26:14,946 --> 00:26:16,721
But do you even have any 
idea what you are getting into

588
00:26:16,947 --> 00:26:18,563
with this guy, who he is ?

589
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:20,251
Is there something we should 
all be talking about ?

590
00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:21,733
- Nick... 
- No, no.

591
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:22,983
It's all right, Kathryn.

592
00:26:23,218 --> 00:26:24,662
We may as well get everything out 
in the open here, right, Nick ?

593
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,163
I'm all ears.

594
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:28,333
I was just wondering 
if you bothered telling her 
about your past.

595
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:30,161
What about it ?

596
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:31,980
Well, maybe about 
your gambling problem,

597
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:33,920
The one that blew a huge 
case for your department

598
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,812
and put other cops at risk.

599
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:37,650
The one that landed you 
on probation

600
00:26:37,908 --> 00:26:39,803
and got you his close 
to getting tossed out on your ass.

601
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,172
Now you think Monica Turner 
doesn't know about that ?

602
00:26:42,455 --> 00:26:44,082
Isn't gonna lead with that 
in a story like this ?

603
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:46,263
I think she's gonna lead 
with what's relevant.

604
00:26:46,578 --> 00:26:48,211
My past has nonothing 
to do with anything.

605
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,543
Well, I think that's a little naive.

606
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,543
You do what you gotta do.

607
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:55,250
But I'd appreciate it if you'd 
let me know either way.

608
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:03,053
Gambling problem ?

609
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:05,993
I've got an ex-wife, too.

610
00:27:06,427 --> 00:27:08,180
She's not gonna say 
nice things about me.

611
00:27:08,548 --> 00:27:09,903
Next time you want me 
to go out on a limb with you,

612
00:27:10,198 --> 00:27:12,130
you better be straight with me.

613
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:19,393
I'm sorry.

614
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:21,142
Where were we ?

615
00:27:22,505 --> 00:27:24,682
Are you still interviewing 
for a new teller ?

616
00:27:26,316 --> 00:27:27,820
Tellers now.

617
00:27:28,808 --> 00:27:30,632
Franny quit.

618
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:32,300
Oh, well.

619
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,453
I never thought she'd go back.

620
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,023
Well, anyway, I haven't 
found anyone yet

621
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:38,900
to replace them.

622
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,922
You know, the therapist said 
it might be helpful

623
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:45,131
if you go in there 
with Felicia at some point.

624
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:47,452
It might be good for you, too.

625
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:49,601
You know, to talk to somebody.

626
00:27:51,685 --> 00:27:53,583
Or you could talk to me.

627
00:27:56,837 --> 00:27:58,191
I know I can.

628
00:27:58,467 --> 00:27:59,732
Do you ?

629
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:09,201
Felicia.

630
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:11,000
What ?

631
00:28:12,118 --> 00:28:13,982
You don't want 
to be here, do you ?

632
00:28:14,145 --> 00:28:16,171
Mm, you're good.

633
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:20,133
You know, I feel like people 
don't even believe me.

634
00:28:20,287 --> 00:28:21,402
Believe you ?

635
00:28:21,657 --> 00:28:23,080
That I lost my memory.

636
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:24,592
Like who ?

637
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:26,611
I don't know, people at school,

638
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:28,741
my mom sometimes.

639
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:30,560
Well, why wouldn't 
people believe you ?

640
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:32,923
Maybe they think I'm trying 
to get attention or something.

641
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:34,240
Are you ?

642
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,342
So you don't believe me either ?

643
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:37,600
That's just great.

644
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:38,873
Felicia, I didn't say...

645
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:42,410
I mean, what the hell 
do you think I been 
coming here every day for ?

646
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,881
Is there anyone else 
you can talk to,

647
00:28:45,086 --> 00:28:47,273
Any of the other hostages ?

648
00:28:47,498 --> 00:28:49,803
I've tried a little, but...

649
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:51,612
But what ?

650
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:56,503
Nobody wants to deal with me.

651
00:28:56,715 --> 00:28:59,121
Everybody just wants 
the whole thing to go away.

652
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:00,832
Okay.

653
00:29:01,035 --> 00:29:02,842
Lookin' good, folks. 
Lookin' good.

654
00:29:03,085 --> 00:29:05,163
I'm just gonna 
give him one last...

655
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:07,670
I got a bleeder.

656
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:08,973
What's the B.P., Mike ?

657
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,132
Uh, 80 and falling. 70.

658
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:12,301
It's the aorta.

659
00:29:12,525 --> 00:29:14,042
Everything else is holding.

660
00:29:14,258 --> 00:29:15,742
Oh, stay with me now, Frank.

661
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:19,393
- Save her ! Oh, my god ! 
- 70. 65.

662
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:20,681
There she is.

663
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:22,802
I've got it under control.

664
00:29:22,975 --> 00:29:25,842
I got you Franck, I got you.

665
00:29:26,026 --> 00:29:28,140
Stop the music, please.

666
00:29:34,865 --> 00:29:35,993
Can you tell me your name ?

667
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:38,173
- My name's Tom. 
- Okay, Tom.

668
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:45,111
I had my doubts about 
Dr. Kates, you know,

669
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,753
for him to operate 
so soon after...

670
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:50,521
But, um, Frank was adamant.

671
00:29:50,726 --> 00:29:53,901
Dr. Kates would never have 
performed surgery 
if he wasn't ready.

672
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:56,020
Yeah, that's what Frank said.

673
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:59,800
He, uh, has so much 
faith in people.

674
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:05,552
There were some minor complications,

675
00:30:05,745 --> 00:30:07,880
but he's looking good now. 
He's stable.

676
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:09,072
Thank you !

677
00:30:09,377 --> 00:30:10,923
Thank you.

678
00:30:11,158 --> 00:30:13,201
I didn't know what 
I was gonna do.

679
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:16,731
How I was gonna raise Chloe if...

680
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:18,633
Thank you so much.

681
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,331
Thank you.

682
00:30:36,297 --> 00:30:37,670
You have five minutes.

683
00:30:39,266 --> 00:30:42,830
I heard you and Kathryn Hale 
talked to a reporter today.

684
00:30:42,986 --> 00:30:44,500
So ?

685
00:30:44,827 --> 00:30:46,140
That was a big mistake.

686
00:30:46,315 --> 00:30:47,203
We'll see.

687
00:30:47,516 --> 00:30:49,133
What are you trying 
to prove here ?

688
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,903
Is this about the girl, what ?

689
00:30:51,128 --> 00:30:52,260
Her name is Eva.

690
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:55,161
Look, mistakes were made.
We all regret them.

691
00:30:55,385 --> 00:30:57,263
But there's plenty of 
blame to go around,

692
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:58,851
including some for you.

693
00:30:59,037 --> 00:31:00,123
I never said any different.

694
00:31:00,387 --> 00:31:02,123
So you want to be 
a crusader now,

695
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:04,762
With no job, no paycheck ?

696
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:07,260
You got a habit 
to support, my friend.

697
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:11,072
Is that what 
you called me here for ?

698
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,540
You may not care 
about your own ass,

699
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,803
but how about your friends ?

700
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:19,571
Your buddy Egan Foote...

701
00:31:19,815 --> 00:31:22,471
He carried an unregistered, 
concealed weapon into the bank.

702
00:31:22,637 --> 00:31:24,683
That's a felony.

703
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:29,040
What are you doin', Pete ?

704
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:32,411
And then, of course, there's

705
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:34,601
Eva's sister Franny.

706
00:31:35,277 --> 00:31:37,573
I bet you didn't know 
she had an ounce of pot

707
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:40,403
and ten hits of ecstasy 
in her purse that day.

708
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:42,382
Yeah.

709
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,602
We found it after 
we took the bank.

710
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:49,073
We've been overlooking it, 
considering the circumstances.

711
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,352
But if we decide 
to press charges,

712
00:31:51,585 --> 00:31:53,762
she could lose custody 
of that kid.

713
00:31:55,127 --> 00:31:58,251
We just haven't had the heart
to do that so far.

714
00:31:59,005 --> 00:32:01,103
It's too late. 
We already talked to the Times.

715
00:32:01,358 --> 00:32:03,223
The story can be killed.

716
00:32:03,518 --> 00:32:06,980
All you have to do is call 
the reporter and recant.

717
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:11,520
There are bigger forces 
at work here than me.

718
00:32:24,935 --> 00:32:26,253
Take your medal.

719
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,631
Take your promotion.

720
00:32:29,605 --> 00:32:31,510
Get on with your life.

721
00:32:36,296 --> 00:32:41,022
...adding a T-9 report 
to all arthroscopic biopsies.

722
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:44,012
We'll bill another $2 per claim.

723
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:46,983
But the T-9 doesn't add 
information. It's pointless.

724
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:48,761
Not to our shareholders, it's not.

725
00:32:49,055 --> 00:32:51,263
But we're profiting 
from other people's pain.

726
00:32:51,587 --> 00:32:54,072
Well... yeah.

727
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:56,851
If you don't like it, 
go join the peace corps.

728
00:32:57,068 --> 00:33:00,500
Now I've had enough of all of 
this second-guessing today.

729
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:01,880
You're an employee.

730
00:33:02,235 --> 00:33:05,893
Your job is to hear what 
the company has to say 
and keep your mouth shut.

731
00:33:06,136 --> 00:33:08,413
You don't have the right 
to talk to her like that.

732
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:09,952
Excuse me ?

733
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:12,250
You don't have the right 
to talk to anyone like that.

734
00:33:12,495 --> 00:33:16,501
Really ? I didn't realize you were 
suddenly in charge here, Foote.

735
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:19,370
You're just afraid, Brian.

736
00:33:19,975 --> 00:33:21,482
It's okay.

737
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,760
Bullies are always afraid.

738
00:33:24,055 --> 00:33:26,793
You never listen to our ideas 
because you're threatened by us.

739
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:29,481
You don't stand up to corporate 
because you're scared of them.

740
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:31,363
Don't you ever 
just want to let go,

741
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:34,140
take charge of this place, 
take charge of your life, 
for Pete's sake, huh ?

742
00:33:34,156 --> 00:33:35,590
Go for the gusto, Brian.

743
00:33:35,608 --> 00:33:38,261
Do something impetuous.

744
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:41,130
You're fired, Egan.

745
00:33:41,948 --> 00:33:45,233
How's that for impetuous ?

746
00:33:45,746 --> 00:33:48,823
Now go be a hero 
somewhere else.

747
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:29,981
Ricky, I told you 
not to do that !

748
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:31,101
Why not ?

749
00:34:31,475 --> 00:34:32,581
Because we agreed,

750
00:34:32,815 --> 00:34:34,993
if I let you stay home from 
school today that you'd behave.

751
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:36,560
Ricky !

752
00:34:38,758 --> 00:34:41,981
Huh. You don't have to keep 
checking up on me, you know ?

753
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:43,601
I was in the neighborhood.

754
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:45,391
I'm just trying 
to organize a bit.

755
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:47,270
Yeah, sure.

756
00:34:47,578 --> 00:34:49,220
How's it goin' there, Ricky ?

757
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:51,221
Pretty cool car. Is that... Whoa !

758
00:34:51,335 --> 00:34:52,270
Ricky !

759
00:34:52,528 --> 00:34:54,061
Sorry. I... I didn't know 
what to do there.

760
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:55,510
It's okay. He's just being a brat.

761
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,830
I'll be right back. Hold on.

762
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:20,543
You've reached the home 
of Franny Rios...

763
00:35:20,705 --> 00:35:22,441
Eva Rios and...

764
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:24,362
Come on, Ricky. 
Don't be shy.

765
00:35:24,568 --> 00:35:26,072
Ricky Rios.

766
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:29,441
Leave a message and have 
a beautiful day. Thanks.

767
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:32,211
Franny, it's me.

768
00:35:32,485 --> 00:35:33,971
I want to see 
how Ricky's doing.

769
00:35:33,997 --> 00:35:35,920
If you're there, pick up.

770
00:35:36,157 --> 00:35:37,872
You know, I'm the kid's father.

771
00:35:38,118 --> 00:35:39,812
I deserve to know 
what's going on there.

772
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:42,271
I guess I'll call you tomorrow.

773
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,610
You've reached the home 
of Franny Rios...

774
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:47,931
Eva Rios and...

775
00:35:48,127 --> 00:35:49,962
Come on, Ricky. 
Don't be shy.

776
00:35:50,137 --> 00:35:51,771
Ricky Rios.

777
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,420
Leave a message and have 
a beautiful day. Thanks.

778
00:35:54,546 --> 00:35:56,113
Oh, go, go, go, go, go.

779
00:35:57,927 --> 00:35:59,413
Eva's ex called.

780
00:35:59,586 --> 00:36:01,582
He, uh, left a message 
on the machine.

781
00:36:01,777 --> 00:36:03,400
Oh, okay.

782
00:36:03,608 --> 00:36:05,112
Is everything okay with him ?

783
00:36:05,355 --> 00:36:07,793
Yeah, I think he's trying 
to get custody of Ricky back.

784
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,553
Do you have a lawyer ?

785
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:12,741
No. I was...

786
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:14,870
I was actually thinking 
of calling Kathryn.

787
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,990
I thought maybe she could help.

788
00:36:17,988 --> 00:36:19,751
I'm sure she would.

789
00:36:20,907 --> 00:36:22,273
Are you hungry ?

790
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:25,821
Can I make you 
something to eat ?

791
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,012
Sure.

792
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:28,661
Okay.

793
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:32,903
Where are we, Mike ?

794
00:36:33,105 --> 00:36:34,942
He's in asystole. We intubated, 
but I have no pressure.

795
00:36:35,155 --> 00:36:36,420
Gave him two rounds of EPI, no response.

796
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,030
We've got tamponade. 
14-gauge needle on a 60.

797
00:36:39,216 --> 00:36:41,352
Come on, Frank !

798
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:44,802
Help her, please !

799
00:36:45,797 --> 00:36:47,082
Let's get him to the O.R.

800
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:49,060
There's no time. 
He's been down for 15 minutes.

801
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:50,351
Then we're gonna open him here.

802
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:51,910
Prep and give me the wire cutters.

803
00:36:52,116 --> 00:36:54,160
- Dr. Kates, he's gone. 
- Give me the cutters !

804
00:36:54,725 --> 00:36:56,473
Okay. here we go now, Frank.

805
00:36:57,888 --> 00:36:59,070
Come on !

806
00:37:02,285 --> 00:37:04,253
Come on, Frank !

807
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,243
We've done everything we could.

808
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:14,432
Call it.

809
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,630
Time of death... 2:48 p.m.

810
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,623
Hey, Dalton.

811
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:07,980
you got a visitor.

812
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:10,780
- Who is it ? 
- Felicia Jones.

813
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:14,321
He says he can't see you.

814
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:15,540
What ?

815
00:38:15,988 --> 00:38:17,300
Why not ?

816
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,042
I'm not a concierge, miss.

817
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:50,723
Why did you do that ?

818
00:38:51,766 --> 00:38:52,970
Why ? !

819
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:58,373
Why did you do that ? Why ? !

820
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:01,102
No ! No ! Please !

821
00:39:33,678 --> 00:39:35,723
I'd say congratulations...

822
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:37,521
I wish you wouldn't.

823
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:39,871
You're not gonna tell me 
what turned this ?

824
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:41,292
No.

825
00:39:43,186 --> 00:39:45,452
I guess we go back 
to our lives now.

826
00:39:45,806 --> 00:39:47,092
I guess so.

827
00:39:49,725 --> 00:39:51,340
We've got a little 
surprise here.

828
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:52,730
Hey, buddy.

829
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:54,251
Congratulations.

830
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:56,770
Oh, Ms. Hale, we didn't realize 
you were gonna be here.

831
00:39:56,957 --> 00:39:58,511
It would be great 
to get a shot with you.

832
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:00,032
Actually, I... 
I have to be back in court.

833
00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:01,222
It'll just take a minute.

834
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:02,441
No, thanks.

835
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:04,630
I... I really have to go.

836
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:11,861
The two heroes.
