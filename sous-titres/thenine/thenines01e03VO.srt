1
00:00:00,565 --> 00:00:02,147
<i>It was an ordinary day...</i>

2
00:00:02,317 --> 00:00:04,884
<i>There were nine of us...</i>
<i>Most of us strangers.</i>

3
00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:06,492
<i>We were all in the bank...</i>

4
00:00:06,828 --> 00:00:08,109
<i>Let's do this thing.</i>

5
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,988
<i>- All for different reasons. And then...</i>
<i>- Now.</i>

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,155
<i>In an instant,</i>
<i>our lives changed.</i>

7
00:00:14,252 --> 00:00:15,891
<i>- Who's in charge here ? </i>
<i>- I am.</i>

8
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:17,450
<i>Get into the vault.</i>

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,413
<i>52 hours later,</i>

10
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:20,692
<i>we came out of there</i>

11
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:23,085
<i>- no longer strangers...</i>
<i>- I'm pregnant.</i>

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,445
<i>Bonded forever by</i>
<i>what we went through.</i>

13
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:27,462
<i>- You haven't told him yet ? </i>
<i>- No.</i>

14
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,720
<i>Two years, and we just flush it down</i>
<i>the drain with barely a conversation.</i>

15
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:33,770
<i>There are two full days of my</i>
<i>life that I don't remember.</i>

16
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:35,972
<i>Somebody has got to</i>
<i>pay for what happened.</i>

17
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>- I'm with you.</i>
<i>- Get on with your life.</i>

18
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:39,581
<i>Take your medal.</i>
<i>Take your promotion.</i>

19
00:00:39,697 --> 00:00:43,382
<i>We understand that a 9-1-1 call</i>
<i>came from with... inside the bank.</i>

20
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:45,492
<i>- Egan's gonna be a hero ! </i>
<i>- Hero ? </i>

21
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,832
<i>Don't you ever just</i>
<i>wanna let go...</i>

22
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:51,121
<i>Take charge of this place,</i>
<i>take charge of your life ? </i>

23
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:52,611
<i>You're fired, Egan.</i>

24
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:56,761
<i>What happened in there ? </i>

25
00:00:57,146 --> 00:01:00,460
<i>Only we know... for now.</i>

26
00:01:08,828 --> 00:01:12,152
Hour 1 - 3:07 PM

27
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:14,900
Everybody !  Come on ! 

28
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,931
That means you, too !  Now ! 

29
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:19,501
- Who's in charge here ? 
- I am.

30
00:01:19,536 --> 00:01:21,780
Just have to get my key... now ! 

31
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:26,532
Everybody else,
down on the floor ! 

32
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:28,892
Go !  Go !  Go !  Go !  Go ! 

33
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:30,311
No talkin'.

34
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:32,022
Okay, okay. It's all right.

35
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:33,960
Damn it, move ! 

36
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:37,023
What part of "get down" did
you not understand ?  Hey ! 

37
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:39,613
You can get your suit
cleaned tomorrow.

38
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:41,831
Get down.

39
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:49,323
All right, you, over there.

40
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,932
Hey ! 

41
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:03,682
Do not move ! 

42
00:02:03,977 --> 00:02:06,051
I'm a doctor. Just let me check him.
I'm right here.

43
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,352
I said back off.

44
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:09,662
Hey !  The doctor's used
to being in charge.

45
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:12,642
But we all know that
you are the boss here.

46
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:14,851
Yeah, you're damn right I am.

47
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:16,963
Why aren't those
people seeing us ? 

48
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:19,482
Tinted windows.

49
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:24,632
All right, all right, I can't...
I gotta get outta here.

50
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,362
- I can't, I can't. I've gotta get up.
- Just shut up.

51
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:27,813
- I can't breathe. I...
- Shut up, lady.

52
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,851
Somebody turn her off ! 

53
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:32,271
It's a panic attack. Please, can I
just talk to her for just one second ? 

54
00:02:32,307 --> 00:02:34,082
- Mother, look at me. Mom.
- All right.

55
00:02:34,118 --> 00:02:36,252
Does anybody have a paper bag ? 
We should get her a paper bag.

56
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:37,460
No, shut up ! 

57
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:39,200
Mother !  Mother, please...

58
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:41,353
Get down or I'll blow
your brains out.

59
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:43,183
Hey, come on, man.
You're not making this any better.

60
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:45,193
Yeah, I can see that ! 
You think I can't see that ? 

61
00:02:45,228 --> 00:02:47,121
Please, please ! 
Okay, okay. It's okay.

62
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:49,750
I have something in my bag
that I think might help.

63
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:52,133
It'll just take me
one send, please.

64
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:54,280
Please.

65
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:55,312
Go.

66
00:02:57,448 --> 00:02:58,651
Go ! 

67
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:02,842
Here.

68
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:03,823
It's in... It...

69
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:07,120
it's, uh, it's prescription.

70
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:09,031
Tranqs ? 

71
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:10,480
Yeah.

72
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:14,563
- All right, cutie pie.
You're with me. Let's go.
- No, no ! 

73
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:18,053
Big... bottle.

74
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:19,762
- Look, please, can we do this later ? 
- All right.

75
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:22,043
Anybody moves,

76
00:03:22,046 --> 00:03:23,410
don't worry,

77
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:24,943
I'm not gonna shoot you.

78
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,842
I'm gonna shoot her.

79
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:28,372
Open it.

80
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:38,842
All right, sweetheart.
Fill the bag up.

81
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:40,221
Fill it up.

82
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:45,303
Come on, hurry up.

83
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:47,351
Hurry up ! 

84
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:54,931
Everybody, quiet.

85
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:09,662
This is bad.

86
00:04:10,077 --> 00:04:11,480
What's that you say, honey ? 

87
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:12,993
That's Mr. Lushtak.

88
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:15,891
He comes every friday
to deposit payroll.

89
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:18,833
He doesn't understand that we're
closed early for the long weekend.

90
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:20,852
He will make a scene. I swear.

91
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:21,890
All right.

92
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:23,402
Angel face,

93
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,222
you're gonna go
over to that door,

94
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:26,302
you're gonna open it,

95
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:29,202
and you're gonna tell Mr.
Lushbag to take his ass home.

96
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:31,561
- No, I should do it.
- No, I got it. I'm fine.

97
00:04:32,116 --> 00:04:35,510
No, she's only been working here six weeks.
I have been here three years. Please.

98
00:04:35,546 --> 00:04:37,581
- Franny...
- He knows me. Please.

99
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:41,753
My gun is gonna be 4
inches from your head

100
00:04:41,936 --> 00:04:45,381
you twitch,
I'm a pull the trigger.

101
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:49,980
All right,
we need to reconfigure here.

102
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:51,910
You, you, over there.

103
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:53,872
You, over there.

104
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:55,521
Hey, pajama boy ! 

105
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:57,272
Move him over there.

106
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,093
No. He could have
a neck injury.

107
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:00,143
"No" ? 

108
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:02,763
- You want me to move him,
I gotta check him.
- Just do it.

109
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:05,342
- Yeah, and kill him
or paralyze him ? 
- I'll do it.

110
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:08,781
No. You're not moving this guy.

111
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,500
This isn'tn E.R.
You're way outta your depth here.

112
00:05:13,155 --> 00:05:14,892
He dies, it's on you.

113
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:17,530
Keep opening your mouth,
and we all die.

114
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:18,963
That's on you.

115
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:22,092
Ordinary day...

116
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:24,353
everything is fine.

117
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:31,372
Franny, what ?  It's 3:15.

118
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:32,732
I'm sorry, Mr. Lushtak.

119
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:34,680
We're closed early for
the holiday weekend.

120
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:36,152
What holiday is this ? 

121
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:38,741
Listen, why don't you come
back on tuesday, okay ? 

122
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:40,271
I'll make deposit quick today.

123
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,090
Not today. Tuesday.

124
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:43,932
Is Mr. Jones here ? 

125
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:48,333
I'm sorry.
We've already turned the computers off.

126
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:50,912
I couldn't get the transaction
done if I wanted to.

127
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:53,882
You looking sick. You okay ? 

128
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:55,310
I'm fine.

129
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:58,340
You're sweet. I'm...I'm fine.

130
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:02,430
Why don't you come
first thing next week ? 

131
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:04,063
Front of the line, okay ? 

132
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:13,952
That's right, Gorbachev,
keep on walking.

133
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:19,841
Down on the floor
and no one gets hurt.

134
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,433
- You get it ? 
- Yeah, it's done.

135
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,100
9-1-1. What's your emergency ? 

136
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:28,763
Hello ? 

137
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:30,553
What's your emergency ? 

138
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:40,362
The Bloc Team presents to you
The Nine - Episode 3 - What's your emergency ? 

139
00:06:43,057 --> 00:06:44,463
13 days later.

140
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:46,240
Can anyone identify this man ? 

141
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:48,221
It's okay.
He's the bank manager.

142
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:50,182
Daddy !  Daddy ! 
What is happening here ? 

143
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,151
Why didn't you wake me ? 

144
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:57,945
Felicia gone to school yet ? 

145
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,215
No, she had a hard time falling asleep.
She wouldn't tell me why,

146
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:02,852
and she still can't
remember anything.

147
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:04,841
- Malcolm Jones.
- Hi. Good morning, sir.

148
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:06,971
She's seeing the
hypnotherapist today,

149
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:09,282
and I am seriously thinking
about calling a neurologist.

150
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:10,631
Neuro... honey.

151
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,492
Just let the child be.
She'll remember when she's ready.

152
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:16,491
If she's never ready,
I'll be all right with that.

153
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:23,561
Uh... Do you want panic
buttons in all the bedrooms ? 

154
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:24,873
Yes.

155
00:07:30,546 --> 00:07:33,703
I'm a doctor. Just let me check him.
I'm right here.

156
00:07:35,908 --> 00:07:38,261
You threw it all away for me.

157
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:46,201
Ricky, please ! 
I need to get you to school ! 

158
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:47,732
No ! 

159
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:50,033
I'm gonna be late
for my job interview.

160
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,552
Please, honey,
help me out here.

161
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:55,610
Ricky ? 

162
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:58,402
What are you doing ? 

163
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:02,973
Ricky, in a minute I'm gonna break this
door down !  Come on, Ricky !  Open up ! 

164
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,511
Detective Nick Cavanaugh...

165
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:07,123
in the paper today. I saw.

166
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:09,232
Yes, all pressed and powdered.

167
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:12,133
I think I should've been invited
to the ceremony, frankly.

168
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,592
Mom, I'm gonna be late.

169
00:08:13,857 --> 00:08:17,262
- I don't know why I agreed
to pick you up today.
- Because it's on your way.

170
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:19,050
I live downtown.
I work downtown.

171
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:22,992
How is picking you up in Westwood
and dropping you off in
Beverly Hills on the way ? 

172
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:25,091
Well, I just assumed you
spent the night at Ed's.

173
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,810
Well, I didn't. I had to work.

174
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:28,842
You're very jumpy today.

175
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,341
Well, it's my first day back in court,
and I have a doctor appointment

176
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:33,080
- smack in the middle of everything.
- Doctor's appointment ? 

177
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:34,420
Nothing's wrong. It's for...

178
00:08:34,455 --> 00:08:37,073
I'm fine, okay ? 
I have a day. I'll handle it.

179
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:02,463
Egan ?  Egan ! 

180
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:04,021
Oh !  Oh ! 

181
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:05,523
How long have you been up ? 

182
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:07,790
Oh, boy. Since 4:00, yeah.

183
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:10,281
Me... up since 4:00.

184
00:09:10,495 --> 00:09:12,930
Yeah, I went for a jog,
now I'm doing calisthenics.

185
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:15,423
It's a gorgeous day,
and you are a gorgeous wife.

186
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:18,573
Did I have a nightmare, or did you
tell me you got fired last night ? 

187
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:22,043
I did !  And it is the best damn
thing to ever happen to us.

188
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:24,921
- Whoa !  Honey, you're sweaty.
- Go with it.

189
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:29,170
Oh, come on, baby.
We have got plenty of savings, huh ? 

190
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:32,182
And I just got off the phone with
corporate, and since I got fired...

191
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:34,053
- Oh ! 
- Whoo ! 

192
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:36,551
I get severance.
Yeah, that's right.

193
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:39,281
That little pissant Ryan's
gotta pay me for six weeks.

194
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:41,063
I've got sick days
I didn't take...

195
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:43,283
I've got vacation time
we never cashed in,

196
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:47,463
and I have an appointment with an
employment agency this afternoon.

197
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:49,453
I'm gonna go out
there today, Mary,

198
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:51,871
and I am gonna
cast the net wide.

199
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:56,750
Never seen nothin' like
you social work's a joke.

200
00:09:56,785 --> 00:09:58,503
Will you get the doctor
in here, please ? 

201
00:09:58,536 --> 00:10:01,350
You're not doing all you have to do to
stay on the transplant list, Celia.

202
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:03,032
And I want to help
you with that.

203
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:04,862
You probably just want
to move her off the list

204
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,620
to bump up a patient
that can pay better.

205
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:08,141
That is simply not true.

206
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:11,223
What is true is that there's no
trace of prograf in Celia's blood,

207
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:12,950
and that alone can
disqualify her.

208
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:15,431
Don't talk to me like
I didn't go to school ! 

209
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:17,630
I went to school, all right ? 

210
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:22,350
What the hell's wrong with you ? 

211
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:23,773
I didn't do anything to you.

212
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:25,292
Y-you saw.
I didn't do anything.

213
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:27,991
Sorry. Sorry.

214
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:42,060
Hey, Nicko. Thanks for coming.

215
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:43,221
What's goin' on ? 

216
00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:46,963
Well, for starters, Randall Reese
had a major heart attack last night.

217
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:48,080
Is he dead ? 

218
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,563
No. They revived him.

219
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:52,670
The doctor can't put his finger
on what exactly caused it. Plus,

220
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:56,562
cartoon cop over here entor a coffee
break and left the room open
for visitors.

221
00:10:56,598 --> 00:10:58,241
So you think
somebody got to him ? 

222
00:10:58,245 --> 00:11:00,903
I got an orderly saying he saw
someone coming out of Reese's room

223
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:03,083
a few minutes before all the
machines started screaming.

224
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:04,422
Hmm. Really ? 

225
00:11:04,636 --> 00:11:07,883
- Hey, Kelli, what's happening ? 
- Randall Reese coded last night.

226
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:11,022
- How is he ? 
- Touch and go.

227
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:13,961
I don't know if they're
investigating something or what.

228
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:16,460
Listen, bud,
I know how you feel about those people

229
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:18,290
that you went through
the thing with,

230
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:20,482
but from what I've heard,
that social worker friend of yours

231
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:22,170
had been pretty messed up.

232
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:24,060
You think Lizzie did this ? 
You're outta your mind.

233
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:26,420
Apparently she was freaking out every
time she got anywhere near the guy.

234
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:28,380
And then last night,
she was seen up here,

235
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:30,110
hovering around and
circling this floor.

236
00:11:30,145 --> 00:11:31,753
There's no way.
I'm telling you, there's no way.

237
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:33,081
All right, look,

238
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:35,172
you were in there with her for two days.
She got motive ? 

239
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,680
I got motive.

240
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,901
Yeah, well,
I'm pretty sure if it was you,

241
00:11:38,936 --> 00:11:40,661
you would've gotten
the job done.

242
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:44,341
I sent Reese's medical chart over to
Mario, so hopefully I'll get some
physical evidence.

243
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:47,820
In the meantime, I would like to
have a conversation with Ms. Miller.

244
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,661
No. I don't want you
harassing her on a lark.

245
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:53,031
You get something in hand,
we'll discuss it.

246
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:06,671
You okay ? 

247
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:10,193
- You still haven't told Jeremy yet ? 
- No.

248
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:11,083
Okay.

249
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:17,593
This is just a routine visit.
I don't know why I asked you to...

250
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:20,253
No, it's...
I wanted to be here.

251
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:27,111
Alex, what's up ? 

252
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:30,280
Yes, I know that witness
is coming in today.

253
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:33,330
No, I don't want you to question
her before I get there.

254
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:37,861
Yeah. Yeah,
and have Allison file the carson brief.

255
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,172
Yeah.

256
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:42,773
No, I refused cave in to that
ridiculous mandatory joinder.

257
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:43,801
Fine.

258
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:47,440
S orry.

259
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:49,921
Elizabeth Miller ? 

260
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,582
Would your partner like
to come in with you ? 

261
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:55,122
- Oh.
- Oh ! 

262
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:57,221
- No, I don't know if you want...
- Maybe if you want to go alone...

263
00:12:57,255 --> 00:12:59,453
- Either way.
- Okay, that's... that's fine.

264
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:05,303
I asked you to page Dr. Kates. We have
been waiting here for over an hour.

265
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,820
What are you writing ? 

266
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,672
I told you. I need to ask your son
what happened. Look, he's not my son.

267
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:13,351
He's my nephew, and his mother
just died. That's what happened.

268
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:14,581
Can you give us a break ? 

269
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:15,613
Hey.

270
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,603
What's... what's...
what's goin' on ? 

271
00:13:17,637 --> 00:13:19,862
It's Ricky. He...he actually
locked himself in the bathroom,

272
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,652
- and he hit his head on the tub or the sink.
- Okay.

273
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:23,183
Can you help him please ? 

274
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,081
Nobody will help him.
They're much more interested in me.

275
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:27,520
I know her, Julie.

276
00:13:27,685 --> 00:13:28,933
Everything's fine here.

277
00:13:29,157 --> 00:13:30,161
- Okay.
- Thank you.

278
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:33,031
- It's her job to suspect. Don't take it personally.
- Yeah, no, I know.

279
00:13:33,065 --> 00:13:33,823
Hey, buddy.

280
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:35,062
- Hi.
- Hi.

281
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,651
You mind if I take a quick look ? 
Let me see.

282
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:39,491
Ok.

283
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,762
Oh, that's not so bad at all.

284
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:43,771
Nothin' a couple of
stitches can't cure.

285
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,973
You see ? 

286
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:46,723
Best doctor in the world.

287
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:49,490
Oh, you must be
really busy, huh ? 

288
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:51,791
Um... Yeah.

289
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:54,112
You know what ?  I'm gonna get
a plastic surgeon down here

290
00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:55,543
to take care of Ricky, okay ? 

291
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,212
- He'll be in better hands with Dr. Rai anyway.
- Okay.

292
00:13:58,246 --> 00:14:00,452
I can't believe the
thoughts I've been having.

293
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:01,832
It's really...

294
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:04,851
I haven't had an easy life.

295
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:10,303
And... in my job,
I see a lot of bad stuff...

296
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:13,683
A lot of bad people,

297
00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:18,110
and I've always been fine.

298
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,751
But now suddenly,

299
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:24,021
I'm scared of things.

300
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:29,760
And not even
particular things...

301
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:34,343
just a general fear.

302
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:38,993
The world feels...

303
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:43,730
violent and dangerous.

304
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,031
And out of nowhere,
something can just...

305
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:54,471
How can you bring
a child into that

306
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:58,353
when you can't even...
I mean...

307
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:02,373
How can you do that ? 

308
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,991
You don't have to keep
that baby, you know ? 

309
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:10,883
The doctor will be
with you in a minute.

310
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:20,073
Hey, detective.

311
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:21,710
We got a woman, early 30s...

312
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:23,950
Yeah, just, uh,
give me one minute, okay ? 

313
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:25,353
How you doin', Mario ? 

314
00:15:25,618 --> 00:15:27,532
Hey, Nicko.
Glad to see you back.

315
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:30,712
- Congratulations on that promotion.
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

316
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:33,692
Hey, uh, did you get a chance to look
at that Randall Reese chart yet ? 

317
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,680
Uh, yeah, I took a gander.

318
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:37,541
You send over the findings ? 

319
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,832
No, not yet.

320
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:42,112
Kinda had my hands full with,
you know, crime scenes and whatnot.

321
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:43,350
No, it's fine. I was

322
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:46,323
just hoping to catch you
before it went back to Vartak.

323
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,282
So, um...

324
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:55,433
Anything in his file trip you ? 

325
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:56,982
Well, actually, yeah.

326
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:58,272
Really ? 

327
00:15:58,587 --> 00:16:01,322
Yeah, large amounts of potassium
chloride in the blood stream...

328
00:16:01,356 --> 00:16:02,762
"KCL" as we call it.

329
00:16:03,037 --> 00:16:05,411
Enough to stop his heart,
which is pretty smart, actually.

330
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:06,441
Why is that ? 

331
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:10,600
Well, the substance occurs naturally
in the system. There'd be no way
to prove he was poisoned.

332
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,633
Unless you have
other evidence, that is.

333
00:16:13,645 --> 00:16:15,793
I want you to sit
on this for a day.

334
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:17,122
Hey...

335
00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:18,423
The guy's not dead.

336
00:16:18,598 --> 00:16:19,592
It's not murder yet.

337
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:21,510
Just a day, for me.

338
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:23,392
Yeah, okay. Sure, Nick.

339
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,232
Just let me know
what to do next.

340
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,833
Mr. Dawson's B.P.
is a little low,

341
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:37,630
but his fever's down to 101,

342
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,291
which is a real improvement.

343
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,063
And he was able to swallow
some water this morning.

344
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,583
Do you want to do this later ? 

345
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:49,793
What ? 

346
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,383
No. I'm good.

347
00:16:59,425 --> 00:17:01,513
...for the Washington case.

348
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:03,382
She can use the template
on my hard drive,

349
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,842
but she'll need to update it with the
gomez ruling in the ninth circuit,

350
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:08,193
handed dowlast month.
That's really helpful for us.

351
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,851
Oh, um, she's not here.
She's getting married in Santa Cruz.

352
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:12,450
Oh, I didn't know that.

353
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:15,161
Yeah, she's, uh,
been planning it for months.

354
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:19,623
Was, uh,
anyone from the office invited ? 

355
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:23,031
Um... I think Marty
and Caroline went.

356
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:26,040
Oh, oh, good. I'm glad.
That's really nice for her.

357
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:27,021
All right.

358
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:28,951
Well, have Allison
take care of the memo.

359
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:31,001
And you know what ? 
Push the bail hearing in Kendall.

360
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:32,931
That way we can nail down
the Lorenzo witness.

361
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,610
Egan foote, with an "E."

362
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:37,303
Not at the beginning of the "Egan"
but at the end of the "Foote."

363
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:39,421
Yes, I know.
I saw you on the morning show.

364
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:40,380
You were the bomb.

365
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:42,471
Oh !  Why, thank you.

366
00:17:42,706 --> 00:17:46,020
Take a look-see at this list of jobs,
and they'll be ready for you in a jiff.

367
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:47,612
Okeydoke. Thank you.

368
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:49,982
Franny.

369
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,143
Hey ! 

370
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:52,803
- Hi.
- Hi.

371
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:56,250
- Malcolm recommended this place
to you, right ? 
- Malcolm send you here ?  Yeah.

372
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:57,492
Yes, yes.

373
00:17:57,797 --> 00:17:59,193
Wait, I thought you had a job.

374
00:17:59,226 --> 00:18:00,412
I got fired.

375
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:02,852
That's okay. Sit, sit.

376
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:06,331
I, uh, I egged it on
in retrospect, so,

377
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:08,492
in essence, I quit.

378
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:12,621
I meant to call you and thank you
for that fund you set up for Ricky.

379
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:13,712
Ah, it was nothing.

380
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:14,972
It wasn't nothing.

381
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:16,722
It was...

382
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:20,352
- Well... let's see your prospects, huh ? 
- All righty.

383
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:21,341
Okay,

384
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:22,750
there is...

385
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:26,823
a position in financial pricing
optimization in Cerritos...

386
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:32,880
Um, a sales operations job for some
I.T. products in San Marino.

387
00:18:33,307 --> 00:18:34,471
Wow.

388
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:38,010
The cubicle walls are
closing in on me already.

389
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:40,462
Is there, uh,
something on there that's more,

390
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,943
I don't know, creative ? 

391
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:43,461
Like what ? 

392
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,540
Like a think tank ? 

393
00:18:45,818 --> 00:18:48,911
Or I could be a docent
at a Civil War museum.

394
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:53,032
Although I think that's generally
a volunteer position, so...

395
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:56,402
Yeah, I think you probably want
something with a little bit
of income, huh ? 

396
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:57,462
Francisca Rios.

397
00:18:58,077 --> 00:18:59,741
That's me.

398
00:18:59,947 --> 00:19:02,093
- Wish me luck.
- You won't need it.

399
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:03,323
Don't settle in there.

400
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:05,303
- Okay.
- Okay.

401
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:10,462
Lizzie Miller here ? 

402
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:18,801
Nick.

403
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:21,012
- Hey.
- Hi.

404
00:19:22,157 --> 00:19:23,741
Isn't this Randall's room ? 

405
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:24,912
Yeah.

406
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:27,770
He's down on four
getting some tests.

407
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:30,420
Apparently he's been
touch and go all day.

408
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:32,141
What are you doing here ? 

409
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:35,361
- I came here to face him.
- Oh.

410
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:37,803
Is this your first
time up here ? 

411
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:39,111
God, no.

412
00:19:39,457 --> 00:19:42,841
I've been on this floor half a
dozen times, circling like a hawk.

413
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:45,692
The nursing staff must
think I'm out of my mind.

414
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:50,020
Were you here when
Randall coded ? 

415
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:53,222
I just found out
a few minutes ago.

416
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:59,900
Yesterday I told Jeremy
I wished Randall were dead.

417
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:09,910
So how is Jeremy doing ? 

418
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,141
Well...

419
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:12,593
He'd never say it, but

420
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:16,402
I think he's having
a harder time than I am.

421
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,882
And he lost a
patient yesterday.

422
00:20:22,117 --> 00:20:23,493
Is he here now ? 

423
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:26,412
Douglas Russell, FBI.

424
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:27,992
Yeah, I remember you.

425
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:30,891
- I should probably wait for my lawyer.
- Oh, he's coming.

426
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:33,370
He's probably stuck on the 5.
You know how it is.

427
00:20:33,687 --> 00:20:35,930
Some of my
easy-listening favorites.

428
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,850
They make iPods now, you know ? 

429
00:20:38,057 --> 00:20:39,073
Much more compact,

430
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:40,631
easy to carry.

431
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,471
Why are you here ? 

432
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:46,923
I've been thinking about it,

433
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:51,360
- everything that happened in there, and...
- Yeah, well, try not to think too much.

434
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:53,520
Just get back to your life.
Forget about me.

435
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:55,803
- But I just...
- Forget about me, Felicia.

436
00:20:56,097 --> 00:20:57,581
Why was Felicia Jones here ? 

437
00:20:57,998 --> 00:20:59,401
You heard the tape.

438
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:01,120
She wanted to say hi.

439
00:21:01,338 --> 00:21:03,763
A little Stockholm syndrome, maybe ? 

440
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:05,620
Good-lookin' guy

441
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:10,002
puts a gun in a young girl's face,
she's seduced by his power.

442
00:21:10,956 --> 00:21:13,041
Or maybe she knew
you beforehand.

443
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:16,920
You really think I planned a
robbery with a 16-year-old girl ? 

444
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:20,840
I just want to know
everything that happened.

445
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:26,322
Let's try that again.

446
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:28,102
I'm in the bathroom.

447
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:31,541
I hear a man yelling.

448
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:34,432
I open the door.

449
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,110
I see my dad.

450
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:39,291
He's walking by me.

451
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:42,312
I'm so scared for him.

452
00:21:42,515 --> 00:21:44,742
I want to call out
to him, but...

453
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:50,263
I see Lucas holding
a gun to his back.

454
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:52,393
I close the door,

455
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:54,780
grab my phone,

456
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:56,670
dial 9-1-1.

457
00:21:57,437 --> 00:21:58,572
Right.

458
00:21:58,806 --> 00:22:00,310
And then what, Felicia ? 

459
00:22:03,096 --> 00:22:04,801
It just stops there.

460
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:07,222
It just stops there, my memory.

461
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:09,431
My memory just stops there.

462
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:11,081
Okay,

463
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:12,502
I'm pulling you out,

464
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:16,953
on three, two, one.

465
00:22:21,355 --> 00:22:23,051
I'm responsible.

466
00:22:23,556 --> 00:22:26,132
I'm responsible for
the whole thing.

467
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:29,670
I'm responsible for
all those people.

468
00:22:31,678 --> 00:22:35,612
Jeremy, hey, it's Nick.
I'm here at the hospital, and, uh...

469
00:22:36,676 --> 00:22:40,620
I just heard that you missed
rounds this morning, uh...

470
00:22:40,848 --> 00:22:43,011
And nobody here can
seem to find you.

471
00:22:43,386 --> 00:22:45,211
I really need to talk to you.

472
00:22:45,468 --> 00:22:46,813
It's important.

473
00:22:50,116 --> 00:22:51,012
Hello.

474
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:53,040
Hi. It's... it's Jeremy calling.

475
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:54,661
Hey there.

476
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:56,732
I was just, um...

477
00:22:57,797 --> 00:23:00,541
I was calling to see how...
How Ricky's doing.

478
00:23:00,757 --> 00:23:03,813
Oh, he's fine.
I took him over to my grandma's.

479
00:23:04,137 --> 00:23:06,183
There's fewer sharp
corners over there.

480
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,060
Jeremy ? 

481
00:23:17,217 --> 00:23:18,641
Are you all right ? 

482
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:26,752
This is nice.

483
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:28,102
Dinner out.

484
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:31,722
We never do this.
We should do this more.

485
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:34,342
- We're doing it now.
- Uh-huh. Isn't it great ? 

486
00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:38,713
So... the employment agency ? 

487
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:41,401
I want to...

488
00:23:41,675 --> 00:23:43,322
hold out for something better.

489
00:23:50,736 --> 00:23:53,262
There's something
I really want, Mary.

490
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:56,230
I want kids.

491
00:23:57,398 --> 00:23:59,411
Or... a kid.

492
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:01,992
One would be great.

493
00:24:02,345 --> 00:24:04,273
- You know we can't, Egan.
- But that's not true.

494
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:06,262
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's really not.

495
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:09,032
We tried once...

496
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:12,101
a long time ago.
We had a hard time, we gave up.

497
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:13,703
Look, I can't talk
about this now.

498
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:15,020
We got scared,

499
00:24:15,335 --> 00:24:18,380
and we crawled off into our
separate corners, and we gave up.

500
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,602
Now there are things that
they can do to help us...

501
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:23,183
with all of it.

502
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:26,373
It's not too late.

503
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:35,441
It's not too late.

504
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,852
It doesn't even look
real from up here.

505
00:24:43,026 --> 00:24:47,010
Well, there's the employment
agency I went to today.

506
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,550
It didn't go well ? 

507
00:24:48,857 --> 00:24:51,553
I didn't finish college,
which apparently qualifies me

508
00:24:51,745 --> 00:24:54,101
to the back entrance of
a lot of our businesses.

509
00:24:54,135 --> 00:24:55,373
I don't type,

510
00:24:55,657 --> 00:24:57,403
I wouldn't take
anything in a bank,

511
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:00,920
I am computer acquainted, but not
computer savvy, blah, blah, blah.

512
00:25:01,148 --> 00:25:03,402
He offered me a
job lugging dirt.

513
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,112
And I took it.

514
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:08,051
I'm kidding.

515
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,873
Come sit down.

516
00:25:17,535 --> 00:25:18,750
I don't know.

517
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:22,630
I just don't know anymore.

518
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:25,881
What ? 

519
00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:29,690
I did things in there
that I didn't see coming.

520
00:25:31,178 --> 00:25:32,290
It's okay.

521
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:36,752
And I've done things since...

522
00:25:39,718 --> 00:25:43,993
I'm sorry... about Lizzie.

523
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,381
I know I really screwed
things up for you guys.

524
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:48,040
No, that's not...

525
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,382
That wasn't your fault.

526
00:25:52,046 --> 00:25:54,740
It's just that I
needed you that day.

527
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:57,600
And I didn't mean to do that.

528
00:26:11,978 --> 00:26:14,231
I needed you, too.

529
00:26:15,756 --> 00:26:17,133
What took you so long ? 

530
00:26:17,156 --> 00:26:18,520
Traffic, honey.

531
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:21,011
She's over two hours late.
She's not answering her phone.

532
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:24,001
Baby, there's nothing to worry about.
She's just being a teenager, okay ? 

533
00:26:24,035 --> 00:26:25,671
What have you heard
from Maggie and Trish ? 

534
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:27,791
They haven't seen her, Malcolm,
and neither has Jared.

535
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:29,630
She didn't show up for
her last two classes,

536
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,602
and I'm waiting to hear back
from the hypnotherapist.

537
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:34,320
All right, all right, baby.
It's all right now.

538
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,122
It's gonna be fine.
Don't worry.

539
00:26:36,276 --> 00:26:37,682
Don't worry.

540
00:26:53,707 --> 00:26:56,553
Hey, congratulations.
I hear you got our witness to fold.

541
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:57,772
Like a paper fan.

542
00:26:58,057 --> 00:27:00,170
So how'd you nail her ? 
Give me all the details.

543
00:27:00,205 --> 00:27:01,433
Rent some porn, Alex.

544
00:27:01,715 --> 00:27:02,631
Hello.

545
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:04,952
N...

546
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:06,520
I can't... I can't hear you.

547
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:08,091
I've... I have bad reception.

548
00:27:08,316 --> 00:27:10,660
- You're what ? 
- All rise.

549
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:14,002
Well, can't you
go to your E.R. ? 

550
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:17,122
You're in your E.R. ? 

551
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:19,842
Lizzie, you're...
you're breaking up.

552
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:21,472
I'm sure that you'll be fine.

553
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:23,122
Be seated.

554
00:27:25,467 --> 00:27:27,913
In the matter of the
people vs. Rubin,

555
00:27:28,097 --> 00:27:31,390
defense has moved for a consideration
of Mr. Rubin's sentence.

556
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:33,521
Ms. Hale ? 

557
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:37,390
- Kathryn, you're up.
- Yes. Ahem.

558
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:40,051
Your honor, in determining
the severity of the sentence,

559
00:27:40,088 --> 00:27:41,252
the court must consider

560
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:44,023
if the factors in aggravation
outweigh the factors in mitigation.

561
00:27:44,058 --> 00:27:45,912
I'm sorry.
I have to go. Excuse me.

562
00:27:45,938 --> 00:27:48,080
Alex, take over.

563
00:27:51,576 --> 00:27:54,142
- When did the cramping start ? 
- Ten minutes ago.

564
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,082
Move. Please move ! 

565
00:28:00,337 --> 00:28:01,590
God ! 

566
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:03,272
Damn it.

567
00:28:04,797 --> 00:28:06,662
Go through, go through.

568
00:28:07,248 --> 00:28:09,572
- Stay still, Lizzie.
- I need to get that.

569
00:28:09,828 --> 00:28:11,372
No cell phones in here, Lizzie.

570
00:28:11,495 --> 00:28:13,283
I don't care !  Give it to me.

571
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:15,941
Oh, come on, Lizzie.
Lizzie, pick up.

572
00:28:16,408 --> 00:28:18,860
Kathryn, are you there ? 

573
00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:21,453
Lizzie, hi. Hi.
Yeah, I'm... I'm here.

574
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:23,801
- How... how are you ? 
- Scared.

575
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:26,263
I don't think my
baby's gonna be okay.

576
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,012
And I want it to be okay.

577
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:30,581
Okay. Okay.

578
00:28:30,845 --> 00:28:33,493
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

579
00:28:34,507 --> 00:28:36,881
This baby is strong.

580
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:41,210
It has a strong will.
It survived the 52 hours, right ? 

581
00:28:41,438 --> 00:28:43,820
It did. It survived that.

582
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:45,621
And you went through
a lot in there,

583
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,253
- and it went through a lot
n there, right ? 
- Yeah.

584
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:50,273
So I'd say if this
baby can survive that,

585
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:53,453
it certainly can survive a
normal day in your boring life.

586
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:04,012
I see it.

587
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:06,493
You... you see it ? 

588
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:08,672
It's there.

589
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,673
Now we just need to
find a fetal heartbeat.

590
00:29:12,687 --> 00:29:14,311
You see it ? 

591
00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:16,842
Now they just have to
find the heartbeat.

592
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:18,422
They will.

593
00:29:24,547 --> 00:29:25,643
Where is it ? 

594
00:29:28,056 --> 00:29:29,472
They'll find it.

595
00:29:32,428 --> 00:29:33,930
They're not finding it.

596
00:29:34,268 --> 00:29:35,953
Lizzie, they will find it.

597
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:44,781
I hear it.

598
00:29:46,346 --> 00:29:47,820
You hear it ? 

599
00:29:48,046 --> 00:29:49,451
I hear it.

600
00:29:50,668 --> 00:29:51,811
I hear it.

601
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:54,631
Oh, my god.

602
00:29:57,476 --> 00:29:59,623
Kathryn, Kathryn,
can you hear it ? 

603
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:02,083
C-can you hear it ? 

604
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:08,080
No, but I... I can imagine.

605
00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:11,452
Hi.

606
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:15,902
Lizzie, you...
you should hang up now.

607
00:30:16,096 --> 00:30:17,150
Lizzie...

608
00:30:18,018 --> 00:30:18,971
Yeah.

609
00:30:21,707 --> 00:30:23,231
I'll talk to you later.

610
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:24,941
Okay.

611
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:34,632
Yes, we did.
We already spoke to the school.

612
00:30:34,976 --> 00:30:36,602
I think you should call
your cop friend Nick.

613
00:30:36,638 --> 00:30:38,012
Please, honey, I-I will,

614
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:39,532
as soon as I'm done with this.

615
00:30:39,565 --> 00:30:42,792
No, no, no. No, she hasn't called
any of her friends. Could...

616
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:46,272
Okay, if you hear anything,
could you just please...

617
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,892
Wait, hold on a second.
This might be her. Hold on.

618
00:30:49,497 --> 00:30:51,930
Hello. Yes.

619
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:57,293
O-okay. I'll...

620
00:30:57,478 --> 00:30:58,570
I'll be right there.

621
00:30:58,797 --> 00:31:00,373
What is it ? 

622
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:05,170
Felicia... broke into the bank.

623
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,450
Where is she ?  Is she all right ? 

624
00:31:09,527 --> 00:31:11,262
She's okay.
Apparently, she found your spare keys,

625
00:31:11,297 --> 00:31:12,492
came in through the door

626
00:31:12,557 --> 00:31:13,652
and tripped the alarm.

627
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:16,473
The guys found her just
sitting in the bathroom...

628
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:18,733
with her phone out.

629
00:31:19,315 --> 00:31:23,373
I'm so sorry to have to involve
you in this. I really I am.

630
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:24,693
It's okay.

631
00:31:34,357 --> 00:31:35,443
Let's go.

632
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:42,763
What is the matter with you,

633
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:44,260
scaring us like this ? 

634
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:45,882
How could you do this to us ? 

635
00:31:45,975 --> 00:31:48,190
- How could you do this to your mother ? 
- I'm sorry.

636
00:31:48,228 --> 00:31:52,642
With everything that we've
been through, why would you...
I don't understand you.

637
00:31:52,815 --> 00:31:54,212
Why would you do this ? 

638
00:31:54,408 --> 00:31:55,433
I don't know.

639
00:31:55,765 --> 00:31:57,693
What were you doing there in
the bathroom, just by yourself ? 

640
00:31:57,728 --> 00:31:59,973
I don't know !  I don't know ! 

641
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:02,213
Well, who would know,
Felicia, if you don't ? 

642
00:32:02,248 --> 00:32:04,053
Maybe you would, dad ! 

643
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:06,440
What are you talking about ? 

644
00:32:06,795 --> 00:32:09,091
Look, I know that
I made the 9-1-1 call.

645
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:11,371
How could you not tell me that ? 

646
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:12,890
Why does that matter ? 

647
00:32:13,246 --> 00:32:16,872
It matters because it means
everything. It was all my fault.

648
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:19,821
It was supposed to be five minutes,
but then the cops came.

649
00:32:19,858 --> 00:32:22,713
Baby... it's not your fault.

650
00:32:22,968 --> 00:32:24,813
Yeah, well,
I don't believe you, dad.

651
00:32:24,957 --> 00:32:26,332
Why would I lie to you ? 

652
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:29,761
Because that's all you've been doing
ever since we got out of there.

653
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:32,000
All I... Felicia,
all I have been doing

654
00:32:32,218 --> 00:32:34,963
since we got outta there
is try to help you get on.

655
00:32:35,216 --> 00:32:36,673
I'm trying to protect you.

656
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,583
Protect me from what ?  ! 

657
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,690
I don't even know what you're
trying to protect me from.

658
00:32:41,955 --> 00:32:44,553
Don't you understand that
that's the scariest thing ? 

659
00:32:44,758 --> 00:32:46,813
At do you want from me ? 
What do you want from me ? 

660
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,443
I want you to help me.
Help me remember.

661
00:32:49,705 --> 00:32:52,042
Oh, for god's sake,
I've already told you ! 

662
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,122
Two robbers came into the bank.

663
00:32:54,317 --> 00:32:56,870
It went wrong, okay ? 
We were trapped for two days.

664
00:32:57,077 --> 00:32:58,571
- Oh, okay.
- You were scared.

665
00:32:58,675 --> 00:33:00,503
"Trapped for two days.
Trapped for two days." I was scared.

666
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:02,492
Is that all I'm ever
gonna get from you ? 

667
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:04,980
Felicia, this is
why you did this ? 

668
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:07,803
This is why you came down here,
to provoke me ? 

669
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:11,192
To what, Felicia ? 
To provoke me to what ? 

670
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:14,632
What would you have me do ?

671
00:33:18,145 --> 00:33:20,881
What would you have me do...

672
00:33:21,678 --> 00:33:28,243
Walk you through every terrifying
step of every moment we had in there ? 

673
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:31,363
I can't do that.

674
00:33:34,028 --> 00:33:36,371
I'm... Baby, I'm your father.

675
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:38,650
I'm your father.

676
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,733
Gotta get through the next
few hours. You want some ? 

677
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:00,081
No.

678
00:34:00,717 --> 00:34:04,381
- Do you have a second ? 
- Sure.

679
00:34:09,385 --> 00:34:11,091
I had a thing today.

680
00:34:11,557 --> 00:34:12,533
I'm okay.

681
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:17,060
Everything's... great.

682
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,092
But, um...

683
00:34:24,675 --> 00:34:26,712
I'm pregnant.

684
00:34:41,728 --> 00:34:44,890
Is this what you wanted to
tell me before the bank ? 

685
00:34:45,107 --> 00:34:46,341
Yes.

686
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:53,492
- And you're telling me now.
- Yes.

687
00:34:57,307 --> 00:34:59,782
- This is a lot.
- I know.

688
00:34:59,985 --> 00:35:00,970
It's just...

689
00:35:02,505 --> 00:35:03,543
It's a lot.

690
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,891
I wish you had told me sooner.

691
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:21,223
It's very shrill.

692
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:23,543
It like a shriek,
and then it goes...

693
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:26,561
From being a shriek
to being a bray.

694
00:35:26,795 --> 00:35:28,503
She shrieks and she brays.

695
00:35:28,787 --> 00:35:32,062
It's... Yeah, you...
you have to be there for...

696
00:35:32,227 --> 00:35:33,573
for that to...

697
00:35:35,627 --> 00:35:39,642
You're... kind of
quiet this evening.

698
00:35:39,895 --> 00:35:43,330
Oh, sorry. Sorry, I was...
How did the returns go ? 

699
00:35:44,087 --> 00:35:47,120
I have a credit at Tiffany's
that I will never use.

700
00:35:49,038 --> 00:35:51,100
Darling, did you
lose in court today ? 

701
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:52,832
No, I won...

702
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,060
a very important
motion this morning,

703
00:35:55,198 --> 00:35:57,843
and a very important witness
for a very important case.

704
00:35:57,878 --> 00:35:59,103
You see ? 

705
00:35:59,378 --> 00:36:01,873
And you were worried you
couldn't handle your day.

706
00:36:07,238 --> 00:36:08,931
When, um...

707
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:13,913
When I was 27 years old, mom,
and I was on this path, I...

708
00:36:14,056 --> 00:36:16,310
I, um, I...

709
00:36:17,046 --> 00:36:21,482
I found out I was pregnant. And...

710
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:26,403
I didn't tell anyone
'cause I could handle it.

711
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:31,843
I went to work. I...

712
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:37,032
excused myself for an
afternoon procedure,

713
00:36:37,418 --> 00:36:42,250
and then I had a cab take me back
to the office, and I went back to work.

714
00:36:43,528 --> 00:36:47,062
I rested for a couple of hours,
and then...

715
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:54,592
I won my first really big case.

716
00:36:54,856 --> 00:36:58,343
It was a really big day for me.

717
00:37:06,437 --> 00:37:09,412
Why are you telling
me this now ? 

718
00:37:27,558 --> 00:37:29,292
I think we got a problem.

719
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:32,030
What's that ? 

720
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:37,463
Someone was seen coming out of
Randall's room right before he coded.

721
00:37:40,037 --> 00:37:41,493
You're kidding.

722
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:45,563
No, I'm not.

723
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,941
And his blood work showed
choice amounts of "KCL"...

724
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:51,630
Pretty smart,

725
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:54,391
pretty untraceable.

726
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:58,230
So you're convinced
somebody tried to kill him ? 

727
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:00,472
Someone with knowledge...

728
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:02,862
access.

729
00:38:04,445 --> 00:38:07,142
One of my detectives
thinks it was Lizzie.

730
00:38:07,965 --> 00:38:08,980
What ? 

731
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,673
Why ? 

732
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,451
She was seen up there
many times that night.

733
00:38:22,955 --> 00:38:24,443
It wasn't Lizzie.

734
00:38:29,147 --> 00:38:32,292
I just want him out
of my I.C.U., Nick.

735
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,400
Lizzie's pregnant.

736
00:38:39,238 --> 00:38:40,293
She's pregnant.

737
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,542
Just found out.

738
00:38:51,108 --> 00:38:52,731
I'm supposed to be a cop.

739
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:58,050
I'm supposed to be a doctor.

740
00:39:00,985 --> 00:39:03,030
If he dies, I can't bury this.

741
00:39:15,598 --> 00:39:18,311
Honey, I'd like you to come
with me into the living room.

742
00:39:18,347 --> 00:39:20,233
I invited some people
over to see you.

743
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:21,950
Will you come ? 

744
00:39:52,176 --> 00:39:53,980
Okay, now I'll tell you this,

745
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:56,500
but, uh, it's only gonna be
what I've heard,

746
00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:58,631
since I wasn't there
with you at the time.

747
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:06,422
You were in the bathroom,

748
00:40:07,128 --> 00:40:10,381
and, um, you must have heard
what was going on.

749
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:12,751
But, uh,
instead of staying there,

750
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:18,640
you so valiantly came out
into the bank.

751
00:40:19,386 --> 00:40:24,002
You so heroically came out
to try to call for help.

752
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:26,073
Well, and... and then,

753
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:31,382
Eva and I saw you hiding
underneath Malcolm's desk, and

754
00:40:31,658 --> 00:40:36,400
we both thought, oh, no. I mean,
we did not want you to have to be there.

755
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:39,603
And I guess it was at that
point that we really didn't know

756
00:40:39,808 --> 00:40:43,781
- what you were trying to do
with the phone.
- I-I did.

757
00:40:44,585 --> 00:40:47,133
But I didn't have the
courage to take it.

758
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:50,252
I-I was trying to
calm my mother.

759
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:53,731
I-I was thinking,
isn't this just perfect ? 

760
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:57,251
My mother's anxiety is actually
gonna get us all killed.

761
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:01,620
I don't know what I was doing.

762
00:41:02,137 --> 00:41:04,092
You were trying to help Tom.

763
00:41:04,376 --> 00:41:06,343
You were trying
to save his life.

764
00:41:06,955 --> 00:41:08,610
I wanted to keep you safe.

765
00:41:08,865 --> 00:41:12,112
You tried to run the phone to me,
but I wouldn't let you do that.

766
00:41:12,128 --> 00:41:16,992
But... I didn't tell you
not to make the call.

767
00:41:17,647 --> 00:41:20,160
I was really scared,

768
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:24,483
and you were right
there with a lifeline.

769
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:26,780
And we found our
way to each other.

770
00:41:28,205 --> 00:41:30,900
See, you had done all
the hard work. You just

771
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:33,692
needed someone to push
that last button.
