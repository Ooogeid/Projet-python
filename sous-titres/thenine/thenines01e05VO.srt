1
00:00:02,058 --> 00:00:03,569
It was an ordinary day.

2
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:04,869
There were nine of us,

3
00:00:04,912 --> 00:00:06,150
most of us strangers.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,313
- We were all in the bank...
- Let's do this thing.

5
00:00:09,594 --> 00:00:10,928
All for different reasons.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,513
- And then...
- Now.

7
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:14,073
In an instant,

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,568
our lives changed.

9
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,660
This will all be over
in five minutes.

10
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:18,973
52 hours later,

11
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:21,634
we came out of there
no longer strangers,

12
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:25,370
- bonded forever by what we went through.
- Two people are dead.

13
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:27,192
One of them was
shot with my gun.

14
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:29,773
There was nothing that you
could have done about Eva.

15
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:32,803
- What are you doing here?
- It occurred to me that 
maybe you could use some company.

16
00:00:32,837 --> 00:00:35,453
- Randall needs a new liver.
- So what do we want to do?

17
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:39,191
We have to try. For Eva. I mean,
he should have to answer for her.

18
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:41,810
Tell me what we need to
do to convince Randall.

19
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:43,620
There's only one thing
that will change his mind.

20
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:44,711
What is that?

21
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:45,723
Me.

22
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:47,482
I'm gonna give you
a piece of my liver.

23
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:48,701
You and me, brother.

24
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:51,511
I need to talk to you about Carlos,
Eva's ex.

25
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:54,033
He keeps calling me saying
that he needs money

26
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:56,402
and threatening to take custody
of Ricky if I don't pay him.

27
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:58,611
Eva's ex did some
time at Corcoran.

28
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,511
- Randall reese was at Corcoran.
- What happened in there?

29
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:03,740
Eva had absolutely
nothing to do with this.

30
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:24,511
We can still get out.

31
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:26,321
No chance. They got it covered.

32
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:28,243
We'll go out the back way.
Take one of the cars in the parking lot.

33
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:29,853
He's right. Hour 1 - 3:19 PM

34
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:32,540
All the firepower's at the front door.
They probably don't even know 
there is a back way.

35
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:34,382
We need car keys now!

36
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:36,193
Take mine. It's the blue 4-door

37
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:39,432
- right outside on 
your left as you go out.
- Come on!

38
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,420
And let these people
just walk away?

39
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:42,913
Not a chance. You go ahead.

40
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:46,371
The way's clear, you call me.
I'll come running with the money.

41
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:49,840
That man's really hurt.

42
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:53,333
Now is it all right if the doctor
and I go out there and help him?

43
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:55,420
We won't cause any trouble.
I promise.

44
00:01:58,447 --> 00:01:59,271
Please.

45
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:03,440
Okay, okay. Okay.

46
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:06,712
One goes, everybody goes.
On your feet.

47
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:10,511
Come on! Let's go!
On your feet! Back out front.

48
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:13,271
- Oh, I wish somebody 
would make up their mind.
- Mother, please.

49
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,461
Let's go!

50
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,763
Easy, easy, easy, easy.
Don't do anything.

51
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:18,902
I need something to
raise his head with.

52
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:21,191
Here. Here, take that.

53
00:02:22,027 --> 00:02:23,133
Easy.

54
00:02:26,907 --> 00:02:27,691
Hey, listen.

55
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:29,620
There was another girl here.

56
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:30,950
It was my daughter.

57
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:32,650
Yeah, I saw her.

58
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:34,483
I don't know where she went.

59
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:38,352
No go.

60
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:41,382
The phone keeps on ringing.

61
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:44,360
- Must be the cops.
- You gotta pick up.

62
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:47,132
You don't, they're gonna assume
the worst. They'll come right in.

63
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,262
You... come here.

64
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:53,141
I'll talk to 'em.

65
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,983
No. She's gonna talk.

66
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:02,673
I'll be listening.

67
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:05,131
Look at me before you say anything.
Got it?

68
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:11,022
Pick up.

69
00:03:13,307 --> 00:03:14,222
Hello.

70
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:18,122
This is lieutenant Dan O'Neill with
the L.A.P.D. Who am I talking to?

71
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:21,001
Eva Rios.
I'm a teller at the bank.

72
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:23,403
Okay, Eva.
Is anybody hurt in there?

73
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:27,441
No.

74
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:29,560
How many robbers
are in the bank?

75
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,350
Four.

76
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:34,952
- There's something going 
down on this plaza.
- You're doing great.

77
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:36,482
How many hostages?

78
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:40,283
- Uh, I think about ten.
- I see cops. They're getting 
ready to come in.

79
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:42,291
- Good. Okay.
- Three, four, five on the move.

80
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:45,052
- Hang up now.
- My son is Ricky Rios. 
He's at blessed heart academy.

81
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:48,132
- Hey, he said hang up!
- Please get him to my grandmother's.

82
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:52,602
We're goin' outside. Come on.

83
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:56,662
I'll go.

84
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:59,361
She'll be too nervous.
You need someone who'll stay calm.

85
00:03:59,397 --> 00:04:00,852
Back off.

86
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:06,623
It'll  be okay.

87
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,522
I'm gonna count to five!

88
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:17,751
Everybody hasn't
started backing up,

89
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:19,260
I'm gonna start shooting.

90
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:23,812
One... two... three...

91
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:25,841
Eva!

92
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:28,283
4 weeks later.

93
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:31,732
I thought you were delaying
Lucas and Randall's preliminary

94
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:34,441
- hearing till after 
they got out of the hospital.
- Turns out we can't.

95
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:36,090
The defense didn't
agree to the motion,

96
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:37,900
so we have to hold the
hearing by thursday

97
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:39,330
to make the 10-day deadline.

98
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:42,322
- I can't believe they'll be 
well enough to appear in court.
- They're not.

99
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:44,682
We're holding the hearing in
the hospital day after tomorrow.

100
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,332
- That'll be a circus.
- I think that's the idea.

101
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:50,921
I'm bringing in all your friends
for a meeting this afternoon.

102
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,371
I'll need you to be
there as a witness, okay?

103
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:55,693
Not a D.A.

104
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:58,723
or someone who thanks me in private,
as much as I like that.

105
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,970
Sure.

106
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,910
Anything else show up linking

107
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:05,912
Randall and Carlos Vega
other than their prison time?

108
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:08,533
No, because we haven't been
looking for a connection.

109
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:10,812
You said there was no way
Eva Rios was involved.

110
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:13,293
- I was just wondering.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

111
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:15,763
Are you saying they
could've been involved?

112
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:19,711
'Cause we're preparing a case that says
Lucas and Randall worked on their own.

113
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:22,451
Now if that's wrong,
I need to know right now.

114
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,630
It's not.

115
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:25,011
I'm just curious.

116
00:05:25,737 --> 00:05:26,831
Okay.

117
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:32,253
It's a schoolboy's fantasy,

118
00:05:32,518 --> 00:05:34,791
completely childish, but...

119
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:37,733
it's something I've
always wanted to do.

120
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:41,172
You've wanted to go horseback
riding your entire life,

121
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:42,882
- and you've never done it?
- Nope.

122
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,261
Any interest in joining me?

123
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:46,802
Most places, they keep the horses 
to a walk. I found

124
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:49,971
-  a stable in topanga canyon 
that let's 'em run.
- Sorry.

125
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:52,240
The only running I
do is from my ex.

126
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:56,050
I guess those feelings never
really dissipate, do they?

127
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,473
Well, there's that,

128
00:05:57,528 --> 00:06:01,242
- plus the ongoing issue 
of spousal support.
- Oh, yes.

129
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:03,622
Uh, about that...
Uh, money, I mean.

130
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:06,111
-  I don't want you to think 
that I expect to freeload.
- Forget it.

131
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:09,332
- No, no, no. Some form of 
rent's only appropriate.
- You're my guest.

132
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,743
End of discussion.

133
00:06:11,065 --> 00:06:11,923
All right,

134
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:14,112
if you insist.

135
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:22,080
I'm off.

136
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:24,962
Ride 'em, cowboy.

137
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:34,152
3:00 in the morning is not a time
to be coming back home from work.

138
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:35,571
It's time to be in bed.

139
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:38,512
It's the job I can get,
grandma, and it's good money.

140
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:40,763
Ricky, hurry up,
or we're gonna be late.

141
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:43,542
Why does his teacher want
to see you for anyway?

142
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:46,780
He's getting in trouble...
Bad grades, fights.

143
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:48,270
How'd he do last night?

144
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:52,904
Like always. He... He cried.

145
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:55,580
He asked for Eva.

146
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:59,272
Do you think he's
getting worse?

147
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:03,290
He sure is not getting better.

148
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:17,872
Uh, you know, you don't have
to come in here to do this.

149
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:20,181
You could use the
A.T.M. outside.

150
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:22,501
Oh.

151
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,733
Yeah. It's perfectly safe.

152
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:27,523
I mean, there's cameras 
watching the whole time.

153
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,032
I prefer eyes that
look back at me.

154
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,523
I heard that about you.

155
00:07:43,427 --> 00:07:44,423
Mary.

156
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:46,843
Good to see you.

157
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,102
Malcolm.

158
00:07:48,407 --> 00:07:51,460
I bring you greetings from
the corporate mother ship.

159
00:07:51,936 --> 00:07:55,483
- Things good up there?
- Last I heard, we were 
making money, so yes.

160
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:57,361
How's it here?

161
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,662
Um, back to normal,
more or less.

162
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:03,933
Listen, the real reason I'm
here is that we have a problem.

163
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:07,763
It's about the guard who was killed
during the robbery... Tom Mitchell.

164
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:09,030
What's wrong?

165
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,443
His widow's initiated a wrongful
death action against us.

166
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:14,440
Judith is suing the bank?

167
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:15,671
The bank and you.

168
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,532
Me? Why?

169
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:19,242
They're claiming negligence.

170
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:22,332
You were his direct supervisor,
so you're responsible...

171
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,820
in theory.

172
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,662
Malcolm, what the
hell happened?

173
00:08:28,016 --> 00:08:32,132
You don't have to worry about any
legal fees or potential liability.

174
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,182
You're indemnified by the bank,
so everything's covered.

175
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:38,351
- Have you offered her a settlement?
- A very generous one,

176
00:08:38,495 --> 00:08:41,391
and the counteroffer
was simply unreasonable.

177
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:44,200
Well, there must be a
way to work this out.

178
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:47,503
I'm afraid it's an
adversarial process, Malcolm,

179
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,461
and, um, she started it.

180
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,603
Hey, bro.

181
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,971
How you feelin', Randall?

182
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:02,313
Like hell.

183
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:03,802
What do you think?

184
00:09:04,015 --> 00:09:05,380
This is Carleton Fry.

185
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:07,223
He's gonna be your
attorney at the hearing

186
00:09:07,257 --> 00:09:09,002
and at trial if
that's your choice.

187
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,560
Wait a minute.

188
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:12,810
I thought you were
gonna be my lawyer.

189
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:16,003
We'll be mounting separate defenses.
It wouldn't be

190
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:20,100
- ethical for me to represent you and Lucas.
- Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reese.

191
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:23,071
I've already done some research 
and come up with some very 
interesting material.

192
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:25,760
Separate defenses?
What does that mean?

193
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,573
We're not here to
discuss trial strategy.

194
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,221
I thought...

195
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:35,513
We were in this
thing... together.

196
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:37,192
Not anymore.

197
00:09:37,497 --> 00:09:40,140
So if we could just go over the
terms of the preliminary hearing.

198
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:41,721
So what's the story...

199
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,121
I'm the big, bad wolf,

200
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:47,551
- 'caused all the trouble?
- Yes. Something like that.

201
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,853
What was this for?

202
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:56,553
I was ready to check out for good,
and you said no.

203
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,272
For what?

204
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:01,102
To screw me over?

205
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:03,710
Have somebody to
blame it all on?

206
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,520
It's complicated.

207
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:06,691
Oh.

208
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:09,713
Oh, I bet.

209
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:18,143
I want to talk to
my lawyer alone.

210
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:20,123
Of course.

211
00:10:25,428 --> 00:10:28,393
You brought me back to life.

212
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:33,251
Don't think you ain't
gonna pay for that.

213
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:51,253
The Bloc Team presents to you 
The Nine - Episode 4 - All About Eva

214
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:55,962
One...

215
00:10:57,488 --> 00:10:58,842
two...

216
00:10:59,998 --> 00:11:01,280
three...

217
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:02,921
Eva!

218
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,203
What the hell is going on?
Who did that?

219
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:06,500
It was an accident.

220
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:08,630
We are not shooting.
You hear me?

221
00:11:08,938 --> 00:11:10,811
We are not shooting.

222
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:12,082
Hey there.

223
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:13,932
Hi.

224
00:11:14,685 --> 00:11:15,593
Hi.

225
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:18,643
Sorry if I woke you.

226
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:21,162
You didn't. I was just resting.

227
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:23,241
We're the first ones here?

228
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:25,363
Yeah,  I haven't
seen anybody else.

229
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:27,690
It's not so easy with
your eyes closed.

230
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:32,512
You look... You look different.

231
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:35,082
Did you cut your hair?

232
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:37,611
It's the sweater and the pants.

233
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:39,641
They're Eva's.

234
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:42,893
I had a-a meeting
with Ricky's teacher,

235
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:48,423
and when we were in school, 
the nun's liked Eva a lot 
more than me, so...

236
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:50,443
What's the problem?

237
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:56,143
Ricky's having a hard time,

238
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:59,360
and his teachers
think it's my fault

239
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:02,400
according to Sister Michael,
there are a bunch of

240
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:05,111
books on grieving children
that I should have read.

241
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:09,533
Plus, I should have him
in counseling and... Oh,

242
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:12,021
I shouldn't be working nights.

243
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:16,183
- I'm trying, you know?
- Hey...

244
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:21,193
You want me to take this Sister
Michael into a back alley somewhere

245
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:24,990
- and work her over a little bit?
- You can do that?

246
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:27,850
Yeah. I'm jewish.
I have no fear of nuns.

247
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:51,243
That was pretty gutsy...
Getting that message out about your son.

248
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:53,671
Well, you do what you have to.

249
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:58,040
Do you think that Nick is in more
danger in here because he's a cop?

250
00:12:58,388 --> 00:13:01,651
His name's Nick?
Y-you know him?

251
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:04,701
It's... hard to explain.

252
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:06,862
I feel responsible.

253
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:09,851
It's because of me's in here.

254
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:13,101
Well, it's not like you invited
these guys in here, right?

255
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:16,383
Yeah, right.

256
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,371
Hey, hi. Mwah. How you feeling?

257
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,412
I'm fine, Egan. Thanks.

258
00:13:43,638 --> 00:13:46,032
Well, if I may say,
you look absolutely glowing.

259
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:48,230
Doesn't she look glowing,
Malcolm? Glowing.

260
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,050
Why, thank you.

261
00:13:56,105 --> 00:14:01,111
I guess now is as good a time
as any to let everybody know...

262
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,080
I'm pregnant.

263
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:11,221
Actually, um... we're pregnant.

264
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:15,582
Well, congratulations.

265
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:17,780
Hello, everyone.

266
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:20,182
Thanks for coming in
on such short notice.

267
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:22,603
This is assistant district
attorney Tim Marley.

268
00:14:22,697 --> 00:14:25,242
He'll be prosecuting the
case under my supervision.

269
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:28,170
He'll walk you through the
preliminary hearing and, uh...

270
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:31,003
Excuse  me. Does anyone know
if Nick Cavanaugh is coming?

271
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:56,791
Nick, I gotta get outta here.

272
00:14:57,015 --> 00:15:00,452
- I think everybody feels that way.
- No, I have a son.

273
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:02,602
You know, he's 7,

274
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:05,491
and it's just me and him.
If anything happened to me...

275
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:08,773
- What's his name again, your son?
- Ricky.

276
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:11,782
Well, I'm doing the
best I can here.

277
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:15,463
If they release another hostage,
I'll try to get 'em to choose you.

278
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,142
What about the others?

279
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:21,623
You can't have it
both ways, Eva.

280
00:15:21,898 --> 00:15:24,540
If you leave,
somebody else has to stay.

281
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:27,432
Look, you're thinking
about Ricky, right?

282
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,121
Yeah.

283
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,573
Then don't feel bad about it.

284
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,210
Thank you.

285
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:41,691
This is a hell of
a first date, huh?

286
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:46,300
Well, at... at least we're
getting to know each other.

287
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,342
Just so you know...

288
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:52,913
I'm not really into the
whole bondage thing.

289
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:57,593
Well, I hope we
get a second date.

290
00:15:58,728 --> 00:16:00,480
I really do.

291
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:03,602
We will.

292
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:05,163
Nick.

293
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:08,892
Yo.

294
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:12,152
Bet to you. In or out?

295
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:14,961
I'm in.

296
00:16:15,376 --> 00:16:17,641
The preliminary hearing
is just a first step.

297
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,881
A judge will hear a brief version of
the evidence from a police officer

298
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,303
- and decide whether 
the case should go to trial.
- Which it will.

299
00:16:23,337 --> 00:16:24,930
Why hold it now
in the hospital?

300
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,871
Why not just wait
and do it in court?

301
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:29,412
We asked for a postponement
but the defense objected.

302
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:32,193
If the defense doesn't agree to the
delay, we have to hold the hearing

303
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,971
within ten days of
the arraignment.

304
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:37,412
- Well, why did they object?
- Because Lucas' lawyer is a shark.

305
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,210
There's gonna be a lot
of press at the hearing,

306
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:41,441
and he wants pictures of
Lucas looking weak and sick

307
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:44,172
to build sympathy for him
for the potential jury pool.

308
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:48,352
At least that's what
I assume it is.

309
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:51,730
That's why we need you all at the
hospital on the day of the hearing.

310
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,460
- So you want us to testify?
- No.

311
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:54,890
We just need you to show up,

312
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:55,820
talk to the press,

313
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,422
have your pictures taken.

314
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:02,251
Look,

315
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:06,450
this isn't a case about a bank
robbery or hostage taking.

316
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,652
This is about the
killing of two people...

317
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:10,910
Eva Rios and Tom Mitchell.

318
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,622
Now they should be
here and they're not.

319
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,990
We need you there
to stand for them,

320
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:18,791
to remind people
who this is all for.

321
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:29,912
Carlos Vega. I'm Kathryn Hale.

322
00:17:30,137 --> 00:17:31,741
I'm with the L.A.
D.A.'s office.

323
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:35,850
I arranged your transfer to Lancaster
at the request of Franny Rios.

324
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:38,301
- You got me moved?
- I did.

325
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:40,981
Well, then I owe you one...
a big one.

326
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:43,313
Must be a relief to
be out of Chino.

327
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:46,070
I'm guessing you were
getting squeezed pretty bad.

328
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:47,512
Oh, yeah.

329
00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:50,071
- Guys wanted serious cash.
- Yeah.

330
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:52,483
Like I had an A.T.M.
machine in there.

331
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:55,862
Tell me, what was Randall Reese 
like in Corcoran?

332
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,343
- I didn't know him.
- No?

333
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:01,143
- Nah. Knew of him.
- Mm-hmm.

334
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:02,900
He hung with skinheads.

335
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:05,990
And guys like him and guys like me,
we don't really, uh...

336
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:08,561
We don't really get together.
You know what I mean?

337
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:11,473
It's just such a coincidence.

338
00:18:12,185 --> 00:18:15,711
12 months after you and
Randall were in Corcoran,

339
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:19,852
he and your ex-girlfriend ended
up in the same bank robbery?

340
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:21,753
Hey, well,
I wouldn't know about that.

341
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:23,651
Unless it wasn't a coincidence.

342
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:26,342
What are you getting at, lady?

343
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,793
It's hard not to connect
the dots, Carlos...

344
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:34,173
Eva, the bank, Randall, you.

345
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:36,183
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You trying to stick this on me?

346
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:38,353
No, I'm just trying to
figure out what happened.

347
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:42,522
Like, were you asking for money
from Eva before the bank robbery?

348
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,060
Okay, yeah,

349
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:50,700
I was asking her for money.

350
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:53,411
But I had nothing to do
with that bank robbery.

351
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:56,050
All I know about that
is Randall was there

352
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:58,781
and the mother of my
child was killed.

353
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:02,513
You've got three months
left to do, right?

354
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,302
Yeah.

355
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:10,742
If I find any communication
between you and Randall Reese...

356
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,222
I mean anything at all...

357
00:19:13,825 --> 00:19:20,420
I'm gonna make it my job to make sure
you spend the rest of your life in jail.

358
00:19:28,528 --> 00:19:31,103
I got nothin' to say to you.

359
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:53,900
You're seriously suggesting Eva
was involved in the robbery?

360
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:57,613
You and I both know that a lot of
bank jobs have someone inside.

361
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:01,110
They came in Smart. Lucas and Randall
they took out the security camera.

362
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:03,220
- They knew what the back entrance was.
- Yes they did their homework.

363
00:20:03,258 --> 00:20:04,800
Homework? They had help.

364
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:07,863
Eva fits the profile.
A low-paid employee.

365
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:10,391
Someone not in the bank long enough
to develop a real loyalty...

366
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:13,290
Except to her sister,
who was also in there.

367
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:14,852
Eva has a criminal record.

368
00:20:15,276 --> 00:20:19,042
- A bogus auto theft 
charge when she was 19.
- Maybe.

369
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:21,153
But we know that Carlos was
pressuring her for money,

370
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,760
and I found out that Carlos and
Randall did time in Corcoran together.

371
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:30,483
- Where did you get that?
- Ed.

372
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:32,732
So  I went to talk to Carlos.

373
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:35,331
- And what did he have to say?
- Nothing.

374
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:37,812
The minute that I asked him
about the bank, he clammed up.

375
00:20:37,848 --> 00:20:38,772
You're a D.A.

376
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:42,150
You're talking about felony homicide.
Of course he clammed up.

377
00:20:42,335 --> 00:20:44,891
Randall always treated
Eva differently.

378
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:47,230
Until he shot her.

379
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:49,863
Well, maybe he shot her
because she snapped.

380
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:53,410
Maybe she was in over her head, and
that's why she was freaking out so much.

381
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:54,590
Why are you doing this?

382
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:57,341
You don't think this
is hard for me?

383
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:59,761
I was trying to help Franny,

384
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:02,473
and then Ed found out
about Carlos and Randall.

385
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:05,561
I vouched for Eva,
and now I'm on the hook.

386
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:08,581
What if I'm wrong?
How much do we really know about her?

387
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:10,752
Enough to know she wouldn't
be involved in this.

388
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:14,112
She was broke and living
in her sister's apartment.

389
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:16,803
I've seen people do worse
for a lot less money

390
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:19,002
than was in that bank,
and so have you.

391
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:21,200
If you were thinking
like a cop, Nick,

392
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:23,270
you would say that we
should pursue this.

393
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:25,432
Why didn't you bring
this to me before?

394
00:21:25,697 --> 00:21:28,291
Because I knew how you felt 
about her, and I just...

395
00:21:28,406 --> 00:21:30,653
I wanted to have
something solid.

396
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,443
Well, you don't.

397
00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:35,520
And you should
leave this alone.

398
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,700
My lawyer told me not
to speak with you.

399
00:21:41,928 --> 00:21:43,430
Mine told me the same thing.

400
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:46,051
Can we talk anyway, please?

401
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:54,703
Thank you.

402
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:57,441
- How you holding up?
- Okay.

403
00:21:58,035 --> 00:21:59,661
Good to see you.

404
00:22:00,865 --> 00:22:03,831
Um, about this lawsuit...

405
00:22:04,045 --> 00:22:06,472
Tom worked for me
for a long time,

406
00:22:06,717 --> 00:22:09,632
and you know how I feel
about what's happened.

407
00:22:09,835 --> 00:22:12,040
But I'm here to talk
to you as a friend,

408
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:15,231
to tell you to take the
bank's settlement offer.

409
00:22:16,198 --> 00:22:17,683
Why?

410
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:20,443
The company has a lot
of lawyers, Judith.

411
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:23,273
They'll fight this
thing for years.

412
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:25,750
They'll make it so
expensive for you

413
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:29,251
that you'll quit,
and you'll never see a dime.

414
00:22:29,687 --> 00:22:31,422
Did the company send you?

415
00:22:31,657 --> 00:22:34,850
No. No, no, no, no.
Absolutely not. I came on my own.

416
00:22:35,285 --> 00:22:36,860
You know what they offered?

417
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:39,803
$43,000.

418
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:44,213
12 years Tom worked there,
the time he put in,

419
00:22:44,215 --> 00:22:46,592
and that's what they
think his life is worth.

420
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:50,442
I-I don't know what to say.

421
00:22:51,218 --> 00:22:54,180
I-I had no idea it
was that little.

422
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:56,231
I don't think we
should be talking.

423
00:22:56,426 --> 00:22:58,032
Good-bye, Malcolm.

424
00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:09,160
Grandma, I'm calling to
see if Ricky's okay.

425
00:23:09,428 --> 00:23:11,353
Like is he crying or...

426
00:23:11,837 --> 00:23:15,261
Oh, okay.

427
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:17,653
Well, just call me if
he gets upset, okay?

428
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:19,331
Anytime, really.

429
00:23:19,636 --> 00:23:21,632
Okay. Besos. Bye.

430
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:23,300
Franny,

431
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:26,992
- heading to work?
- Hollywood nightlife waits.

432
00:23:27,246 --> 00:23:29,872
- Little something to get you there?
- Yeah, thanks.

433
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:34,260
You're looking good tonight.

434
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:37,982
Franny.

435
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:41,332
Oh, hey, Jeremy.

436
00:23:41,595 --> 00:23:44,083
Um, this is Marco.

437
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:45,203
What's up, dude?

438
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:46,453
Shot?

439
00:23:46,637 --> 00:23:48,731
Uh, no, thanks.

440
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,503
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

441
00:23:58,606 --> 00:23:59,832
About Lizzie...

442
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:01,282
Yeah, actually, um,

443
00:24:01,688 --> 00:24:04,290
- that's really great 
news for you guys.
- The point being,

444
00:24:04,328 --> 00:24:07,393
I didn't know she was pregnant
when you and I got together.

445
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:11,050
It was her secret then.
Otherwise I never would've...

446
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:12,672
Okay.

447
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:18,021
And I've only known myself
for a couple of weeks now.

448
00:24:18,268 --> 00:24:20,322
And I'm trying to figure
out what it all means, so...

449
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:22,442
Okay, stop, Jeremy, seriously.

450
00:24:22,688 --> 00:24:24,540
You don't have to apologize.

451
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:27,490
I mean, look,
we went through this thing.

452
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:30,023
We slept together once.

453
00:24:30,288 --> 00:24:32,020
You don't owe me anything.

454
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,313
You know,
we're not in a relationship.

455
00:24:34,525 --> 00:24:37,291
And right now,
I actually have to go to work.

456
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,923
I understand that the company has
to protect its interests, sir,

457
00:24:48,305 --> 00:24:51,753
but Tom Mitchell literally
gave his life for the bank.

458
00:24:52,147 --> 00:24:55,563
I'm aware of our responsibility to
the shareholders, sir, but we...

459
00:24:56,136 --> 00:24:58,572
Yes, but...

460
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:00,892
I understand.

461
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:05,840
No, thank you for speaking to
me this late, Mr. Babbage.

462
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:08,850
Well...

463
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,771
They take her to court,
Judith might win.

464
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:14,761
- She'll never see a penny.
- Oh, you don't know that,

465
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,893
and Judith has lawyers to look
out for her. You don't have to.

466
00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:19,831
Look, honey, can we please go?

467
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:22,553
You know, if we're late, they're not
gonna seat us until intermission.

468
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,773
Wait a minute. Wait.

469
00:25:24,086 --> 00:25:26,420
We met the chairman at that M.S.
fund-raiser, didn't we?

470
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,600
Malcolm, let it go.

471
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:32,390
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can, and you need to.

472
00:25:32,726 --> 00:25:34,591
Look, do you know how
long it's been since

473
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,801
we had a talk that
wasn't about this place?

474
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,622
You know,
dealing with the police

475
00:25:38,658 --> 00:25:42,130
- and hiring new employees 
and now this lawsuit...
- You don't understand!

476
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,092
Okay, I'm their main witness.

477
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:46,470
They're gonna be using
me against Judith.

478
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,791
- Now how can I just let that happen?
- Honey, look, I know

479
00:25:50,027 --> 00:25:51,572
that you felt helpless in here.

480
00:25:51,877 --> 00:25:54,100
There were things that you didn't see,
things that you

481
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:56,471
couldn't control, Malcolm.
But is this

482
00:25:56,735 --> 00:26:00,742
really the way to
make up for it?

483
00:26:05,348 --> 00:26:06,282
Ed?

484
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,483
Ed?

485
00:26:37,315 --> 00:26:40,931
So did everything go okay
last night at grandma's?

486
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,882
Yeah. She sang me a song.

487
00:26:43,197 --> 00:26:45,341
She said she used to
sing it for mama.

488
00:26:46,468 --> 00:26:49,483
It's nice over at grandma's,
isn't it?

489
00:26:49,957 --> 00:26:51,882
With that big yard?

490
00:26:52,176 --> 00:26:54,812
Yeah, and some kids from
next door came over.

491
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:58,260
One of 'em said next time I go,
I can ride his bike.

492
00:26:58,947 --> 00:27:00,263
Ricky...

493
00:27:01,628 --> 00:27:03,741
You know how much
I love you, right?

494
00:27:04,085 --> 00:27:05,641
Sure, aunt Franny.

495
00:27:07,098 --> 00:27:08,221
Okay.

496
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:11,141
I just wanted to say it.

497
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:38,083
I'm all right.

498
00:27:38,298 --> 00:27:39,272
I'm not hurt.

499
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,120
What was he saying to you?

500
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:44,901
Saying?

501
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:46,941
Just now.

502
00:27:47,747 --> 00:27:49,551
Uh, I-I don't know.

503
00:28:04,258 --> 00:28:05,551
Kathryn Hale.

504
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:08,580
- You know that thing 
we were talking about before.
- Yes.

505
00:28:08,615 --> 00:28:10,163
Did you find out anything else?

506
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:11,971
As a matter of fact...

507
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:13,671
You want to hear?

508
00:28:15,588 --> 00:28:16,883
Yeah.

509
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:20,081
Eva bought plane tickets to
Phoenix for herself and Ricky,

510
00:28:20,227 --> 00:28:21,682
one-way.

511
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:24,243
The flights were the
day after the robbery.

512
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,731
Where did you get that?

513
00:28:30,706 --> 00:28:32,290
I can't tell you.

514
00:28:33,738 --> 00:28:34,671
Wow.

515
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,382
All right.

516
00:28:37,777 --> 00:28:39,181
I'll look into it.

517
00:28:40,587 --> 00:28:41,401
Bye.

518
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,572
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Mary.

519
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:05,500
Malcolm, what's up?
Why the call?

520
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:06,651
Well...

521
00:29:06,968 --> 00:29:08,743
I have been doing some research

522
00:29:08,928 --> 00:29:10,690
for the lawsuit, and, uh,

523
00:29:10,946 --> 00:29:13,362
I dug up a few things I
thought we should discuss.

524
00:29:13,396 --> 00:29:14,823
What kind of research?

525
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:18,553
This is an e-mail that I
sent last may 17 asking

526
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:21,103
corporate to consider
installing bulletproof glass

527
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:24,453
for the tellers and metal
detectors at the entrances

528
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:26,200
to improve security.

529
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:29,541
And this is the reply
refusing that request

530
00:29:29,776 --> 00:29:33,250
because corporate wants to project
"a homey and inviting image."

531
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:38,151
I guess bulletproof glass and metal
detectors don't exactly say "home."

532
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,770
What are you doing, Malcolm?

533
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,382
This is another e-mail
sent last september 23

534
00:29:42,397 --> 00:29:46,491
asking that our security camera system
be updated from analog to digital.

535
00:29:46,878 --> 00:29:49,731
And this is the refusal
from corporate...

536
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:53,011
- too expensive.
- Malcolm, you don't want to do this.

537
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:55,420
This one's pertinent.
It's my proposal that

538
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:58,041
we double the number of guards
on duty at closing time

539
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:00,161
since that's when
most robberies occur.

540
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:03,640
Again, refused by corporate...
too expensive.

541
00:30:03,915 --> 00:30:07,393
So you're blackmailing
the bank?

542
00:30:08,915 --> 00:30:12,850
I just think it's important that
corporate behave responsibly.

543
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:17,752
This is a mistake, Malcolm.

544
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:26,840
Kathryn Hale.

545
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:28,431
She moved the ticket.

546
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:30,963
What do you mean?

547
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:35,092
She moved the date of the flight three
times in the four weeks before
the robbery.

548
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:37,311
It's a classic tell for
someone on the inside.

549
00:30:37,346 --> 00:30:38,941
The date of the
job keeps changing,

550
00:30:38,977 --> 00:30:41,181
so they keep changing
the getaway date.

551
00:30:41,776 --> 00:30:43,370
So what do we do?

552
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:17,271
Hey.

553
00:31:18,906 --> 00:31:20,361
What's up?

554
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,560
We need to talk
to you about Eva.

555
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:32,591
So?

556
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:39,491
We think there's a possibility that
Eva was involved in the robbery.

557
00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:41,861
Maybe she helped Randall
and Lucas plan it.

558
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:43,922
You're kidding, right?

559
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:46,540
Oh, my god. No.

560
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:49,171
- Hear us out.
- No! No way.

561
00:31:49,405 --> 00:31:51,032
We found her criminal record.

562
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,400
You mean that thing
when she was 19?

563
00:31:53,968 --> 00:31:55,230
I don't...

564
00:31:55,526 --> 00:31:58,570
She was arrested because Celia
Castro lived with us for six months,

565
00:31:58,606 --> 00:32:00,102
and Celia was crazy.

566
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:01,913
Celia got everybody in trouble.

567
00:32:02,078 --> 00:32:05,140
That was the only bad thing
Eva did in her whole life.

568
00:32:05,436 --> 00:32:08,470
You really believe this? You?

569
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,632
Look, we all know that Carlos
was pressuring her for money.

570
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:13,462
Carlos was always
asking her for money.

571
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:15,621
You don't think she' rob a bank for it,
do you?

572
00:32:15,656 --> 00:32:19,022
Franny, we're telling you this because
if there's anything to this, we need
to know.

573
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:21,473
If the press or a lawyer
gets ahold of this,

574
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:23,762
it'll be bad for everyone.

575
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:26,033
How could you think this?

576
00:32:26,348 --> 00:32:28,950
She bought a one-way ticket to leave
town the day after the robbery.

577
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,050
So?

578
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:32,902
She was planning on living
with our cousins in Phoenix.

579
00:32:32,936 --> 00:32:35,792
- She didn't think L.A. was working out.
- She moved it three times, Franny.

580
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:37,702
It's 100 bucks every
time you rebook.

581
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:39,620
I know what that kind
of money meant to her.

582
00:32:39,655 --> 00:32:41,972
Are you gonna tell me
she changed it for fun?

583
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,282
You really want to know why
she changed that ticket?

584
00:32:44,316 --> 00:32:45,313
Yeah.

585
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:46,711
Really?

586
00:32:48,317 --> 00:32:50,743
It was because of you, Nick.

587
00:32:52,516 --> 00:32:55,242
She changed her travel
plans because of me?

588
00:32:55,245 --> 00:32:57,711
She kept on hoping that something
was gonna happen with you,

589
00:32:57,746 --> 00:33:01,650
so she changed her ticket,
just waiting for you to ask her out.

590
00:33:01,915 --> 00:33:04,782
- Oh, come on.
- I told her she was an idiot.

591
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:07,241
But you kept on coming in,
giving her hope.

592
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,312
There you are. Uh...

593
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:13,643
Oh, sorry to interrupt.

594
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:16,080
Um... it's starting.

595
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:31,872
What's he saying?

596
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:35,113
He's telling the judge what was 
at the scene and what we said 
in our statements.

597
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:36,963
Isn't that Hearsay?
I thought they couldn't do that.

598
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:38,462
At trial they can't,

599
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:41,120
but in a prelim hearing,
Hearsay is admissible.

600
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:45,453
He's done. And in ten minutes, 
the judge will rule,

601
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:47,543
and this will be over.

602
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,321
Can't be too soon.

603
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:52,021
Are you all right?

604
00:33:57,087 --> 00:33:58,563
What's happening?

605
00:33:58,878 --> 00:34:00,140
Kathryn.

606
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:06,232
Randall's atorney has called
Felicia to the stand.

607
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:07,261
What?

608
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:09,081
- No.
- Absolutely not.

609
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:12,112
I can't prevent it. It's Randall's
right to question a witness.

610
00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:13,642
How could you let him do this?

611
00:34:13,777 --> 00:34:16,091
We objected.
The judge is giving him the leeway.

612
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,371
Then we are walking
out of here.

613
00:34:17,408 --> 00:34:19,002
That would be
contempt of court.

614
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,631
- The judge would issue 
warrants for your arrest.
- I don't want to do this.

615
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:23,341
Why didn't you tell
us this could happen?

616
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,470
Because he knew we wouldn't
show up if he did.

617
00:34:25,506 --> 00:34:27,652
Mr. Jones, I'll do everything
I can to limit the questions.

618
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:30,430
- I don't want her questioned at all.
- For god's sake,

619
00:34:30,457 --> 00:34:32,701
the girl doesn't even
remember what happened.

620
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,953
I'm afraid that doesn't matter.

621
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:46,260
Miss Jones, I want to ask you
about what happened in the bank.

622
00:34:46,908 --> 00:34:48,251
I can't tell you.

623
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:51,153
I don't remember except
for the first few minutes.

624
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,413
So I've been told.
You have amnesia.

625
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:56,062
You can't remember anything?

626
00:34:56,238 --> 00:34:57,912
- No.
- No.

627
00:34:58,286 --> 00:35:03,673
Uh, so you don't remember Mr. Dalton's
very affectionate treatment of you?

628
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:10,160
- No.
- Look, this is garbage. 
Stop it, Mr. Dalton.

629
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:14,712
Uh, you remember things
since the robbery though?

630
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:17,403
You remember what you
did last week, say?

631
00:35:18,056 --> 00:35:19,092
Yes.

632
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:24,053
Then you remember going to visit Mr.
Dalton in jail three weeks ago?

633
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:25,951
Because the, uh,

634
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:28,520
the visitor log
says that you did.

635
00:35:28,815 --> 00:35:31,520
- Your honor, I ask again 
the relevance here.
- I'll tell you.

636
00:35:31,556 --> 00:35:34,600
- Mr. Reese...
- My brother's trying 
to blame all this on me.

637
00:35:34,705 --> 00:35:37,533
He set this whole thing up,
and now he's trying to set me up

638
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,540
- again by turning all 
these people against me.
- You're full of it.

639
00:35:40,578 --> 00:35:41,620
Go ahead and ask her.

640
00:35:41,778 --> 00:35:42,870
Mr. Reese, Mr. Dalton,

641
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,542
either one of you speaks again,
I'll have you gagged.

642
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:46,931
Miss Jones,

643
00:35:47,157 --> 00:35:48,933
you have to answer
the question.

644
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:52,063
Um, could somebody
repe it, please?

645
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:55,491
Do you remember going to see Mr.
Dalton in jail?

646
00:35:58,565 --> 00:36:00,292
Yes.

647
00:36:00,298 --> 00:36:02,240
And why did you go to see him?

648
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:04,971
I went...

649
00:36:05,568 --> 00:36:09,240
- because I felt connected to him.
- Connected?

650
00:36:09,496 --> 00:36:11,040
Yes, like...

651
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:15,480
Like maybe he had saved me.

652
00:36:15,668 --> 00:36:17,203
From what?

653
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:22,701
From him.

654
00:36:34,515 --> 00:36:35,622
In the end,

655
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:37,802
the system did what it
was supposed to do,

656
00:36:37,835 --> 00:36:40,932
and that is hold Randall Reese
and Lucas Dalton over for trial.

657
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:42,413
Now I'll take your questions.

658
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,513
- Right here, right here.
- Dana.

659
00:36:45,896 --> 00:36:48,921
I was wrong... about Eva.

660
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:51,071
Yeah?

661
00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:54,081
If Eva was involved,

662
00:36:54,307 --> 00:36:55,860
Randall would've said so today.

663
00:36:55,908 --> 00:36:57,811
No way he wouldn't
play that card.

664
00:36:59,366 --> 00:37:02,080
- Sorry.
- Forget it.

665
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:16,392
You get in the car.

666
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:19,183
I'm taking her home.

667
00:37:19,646 --> 00:37:21,210
Hold... hold on one second.

668
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:22,472
Um...

669
00:37:24,038 --> 00:37:25,080
All right.

670
00:37:25,397 --> 00:37:28,531
You need to pay more attention
to your family, Malcolm.

671
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:52,573
Hi.

672
00:37:54,215 --> 00:37:56,352
Why do you keep on coming here?

673
00:37:56,987 --> 00:38:00,352
- Do you really need to ask?
- Yes.

674
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:06,690
You said that I don't
owe you anything.

675
00:38:07,398 --> 00:38:09,591
But I don't think
you believe that.

676
00:38:09,836 --> 00:38:11,280
I know I don't.

677
00:38:13,136 --> 00:38:15,062
Because there's something here.

678
00:38:18,117 --> 00:38:20,772
You've become important to me.

679
00:38:32,245 --> 00:38:33,630
Can I come in?

680
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:37,252
Sure.

681
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:45,640
Where's Ricky?

682
00:38:46,176 --> 00:38:49,442
He's gonna be staying at
his grandma's for a while.

683
00:38:49,715 --> 00:38:52,351
It's just much better
for him over there.

684
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,083
They're Eva's.

685
00:38:57,326 --> 00:38:58,832
They don't really fit.

686
00:38:59,845 --> 00:39:02,942
- You want some help?
- Sure.

687
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,782
It really is a lovely view,
isn't it?

688
00:39:21,036 --> 00:39:22,252
It's not bad.

689
00:39:22,468 --> 00:39:23,603
Peaceful.

690
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:25,952
You could almost say calming.

691
00:39:26,185 --> 00:39:27,762
I wouldn't go that far.

692
00:39:32,188 --> 00:39:36,130
Did you and Kathryn really think 
that Eva had something to do 
with the robbery?

693
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,473
Franny told me.

694
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:44,893
Yes.

695
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:47,471
But...

696
00:39:47,745 --> 00:39:49,790
I don't know why I
ever believed it.

697
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:54,500
Well, I think it
would make it...

698
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:57,110
easier coping if you

699
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:59,423
thought she was
responsible in some way.

700
00:40:00,195 --> 00:40:02,112
We all saw how you

701
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:04,883
felt, Nick,
what you went through.

702
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:07,981
It's a joke.

703
00:40:09,057 --> 00:40:10,350
What is?

704
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:16,982
You meet someone and
you think you might...

705
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:19,221
I don't know, y...

706
00:40:22,015 --> 00:40:25,230
And then she gets
taken away from you.

707
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:31,901
The way I see it,

708
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:33,841
you could meet someone...

709
00:40:34,258 --> 00:40:35,772
Know her for two days,

710
00:40:37,136 --> 00:40:39,560
or never meet her at all.

711
00:40:42,168 --> 00:40:43,740
I know which I'd choose.

712
00:40:49,568 --> 00:40:50,490
Good night.

713
00:40:58,475 --> 00:40:59,791
I have a feeling.

714
00:41:02,846 --> 00:41:05,860
I felt it the first time
you walked into the bank...

715
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:09,250
The first time I saw you...

716
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:14,293
That maybe all the bad stuff
that's been happening to me...

717
00:41:15,157 --> 00:41:16,681
It's gonna end.

718
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:22,640
Like maybe my luck is changing.

719
00:41:31,138 --> 00:41:33,220
I felt that way, too.

720
00:41:41,268 --> 00:41:46,642
