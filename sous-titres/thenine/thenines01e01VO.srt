1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,521
LOOK... I WOKE UP,
I WENT TO WORK.

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:05,014
IT WAS A REGULAR DAY.

3
00:00:05,114 --> 00:00:06,918
AND THEN I ENDED UP
IN THERE...

4
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,740
WITH ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.

5
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:13,113
MOST OF US DIDN'T KNOW
EACH OTHER AT ALL.

6
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:15,030
BUT AFTER
WHAT WE WENT THROUGH...

7
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:20,342
I DON'T KNOW.

8
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:24,184

00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:26,360
DRKATES IS A TOP SURGEON.
HE'S IN GOOD HANDS...

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,228
 <i>REALLY</i> GOOD HANDS.

11
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:29,912
HE'S STABLE.

12
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:32,203
OH! OH, THANK GOD.

13
00:00:32,203 --> 00:00:32,709
STUD.

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,947
I HAVE A TREMENDOUS URGE
TO KISS YOU RIGHT NOW.

15
00:00:34,988 --> 00:00:37,910
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
NOT A PROBLEM.

16
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,478
(woman) THANK YOU, LIZZIE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE WOULD'VE
GOTTEN THROUGH ALL THIS

17
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:40,562
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

18
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:44,327
WHY DON'T YOU HEAD UP
TO THE THIRD FLOOR?

19
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:46,319
I'LL GET YOU IN TO SEE NADER
AS SOON AS I CAN.
OKAY.

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,999
YOU ALWAYS GET THE HUGS.
I NEVER GET THE HUGS.

21
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,766
YOU'VE USUALLY GOT
A SCALPEL IN YOUR HAND.

22
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:53,235
BESIDES, YOU DON'T REALLY
WANT THE HUGS.

23
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:55,021
NO, BUT I'D LIKE
TO BE ASKED.

24
00:00:55,827 --> 00:00:57,540
(laughs) I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

25
00:00:58,501 --> 00:00:59,522
I'M IN TROUBLE.

26
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:02,304
MAYBE. I'LL TELL YOU
OVER LUNCH.

27
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,717
SO FONTANA'S FREAKING OUT.

28
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:06,663
HE'S SURE THIS IS GONNA BE
HIS OWN PERSONAL "CRYING GAME,"

29
00:01:06,663 --> 00:01:09,116
AND <i>SHE</i> REACHES
INTO HER HOT PANTS,

30
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:10,701
WHIPS OUT A .45.

31
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:13,807
GUY'S GOT A GUN IN HIS FACE,
AND THIS JACKASS IS RELIEVED.

32
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:14,535
(man) CAVANAUGH.

33
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:15,612
THANKS, SEAN.

34
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:16,913
NICKO, A WORD.

35
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:20,894
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN GOING
TO YOUR G.A. MEETINGS.

36
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:23,665
THE DEPARTMENT MANDATED SIX.
I DID MY SIX.

37
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:25,589
SO YOU'RE CURED.
COME ON, PETE.

38
00:01:25,589 --> 00:01:26,659
THIS GROUP THING
IS NOT FOR ME.

39
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:29,553
BUT I HAVEN'T LAID A BET
IN THREE MONTHS.

40
00:01:29,603 --> 00:01:32,520
HAVEN'T EVEN BOUGHT
A LOTTO TICKET.
ALL I'M SAYING IS, WITH YOUR
HISTORY, YOU DON'T HAVE--

41
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,116
LEAVE MY FATHER OUT OF THIS.
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR FATHER.

42
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,511
I'M JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU, NICK.

43
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,613
WELL, I'M THE GUY WITH
THE MOST COLLARS LAST YEAR.

44
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:40,334
IF YOU'RE REALLY
LOOKIN' OUT FOR ME,

45
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,271
SHOULDN'T WE BE TALKIN' ABOUT
THE PROMOTION I WAS PROMISED?

46
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:43,465
WE WERE READY
TO GIVE YOU THAT PROMOTION

47
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:45,280
UNTIL YOU BLEW IT WITH
YOUR LITTLE GAMBLING MISHAP.

48
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,497
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO KEEPS
SHOOTING YOU

49
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:47,340
IN THE FOOT HERE, NICK.

50
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,068
YOU DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB
OF THAT YOURSELF.

51
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,332
OKAY. I'M GONNA GO
DEPOSIT MY PAYCHECK...

52
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,211
IN MY SAVINGS ACCOUNT.

53
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,356
I HAVE NO SYMPATHY.
I MEAN, NONE.

54
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:02,242
SHE KNEW THAT HEROIN WAS PUTTING
THOSE DIAMONDS ON HER FINGERS,

55
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:04,391
AND NOW SHE'S SCARED?
PLEASE.

56
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,093
I TOLD HER THAT IF
SHE DOESN'T TESTIFY,

57
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:09,271
I'M GONNA RING HER UP FOR 10
TO 15 ON CONSPIRACY CHARGES.

58
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:10,945
I THOUGHT WE SAID
NO SHOPTALK TODAY.

59
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:13,963
SORRY.
CAN'T HELP IT, I GUESS.

60
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:14,724
YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP IT.

61
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:17,556
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT DO YOU SOME
GOOD TO REALLY BE WHERE YOU ARE.

62
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,113
THAT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE SOMETHING
YOU MIGHT SAY TO SOMEONE

63
00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:22,747
YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH.
I'M SORRY.
I GUESS I CAN'T HELP IT.

64
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:24,545
OLD HABIT.
COME ON.

65
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,323
NO ISSUES, NO EXPECTATIONS--

66
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:28,027
IT'S BETTER LIKE THIS,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

67
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,257
(cell phone rings)

68
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,135
LEAVE IT.

69
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:32,317
(ring)

70
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:35,918
(ring)

71
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:36,916
HELLO.
(woman) Kathryn.

72
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:37,563
MOTHER...

73
00:02:37,563 --> 00:02:38,657
I'M AT THE BANK.

74
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:42,162
SOMEONE HAS STOLEN MY CAMEO PIN
FROM MY SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX.

75
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:44,010
WELL, DID YOU TALK
TO THE MANAGER?

76
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,959
YES, YES,
I TALKED TO HIM.

77
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,332
HE KEEPS TELLING ME
HOW GOOD THE SECURITY IS.

78
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:52,353
I TOLD HIM MDAUGHTER IS
AN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

79
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:53,799
I DON'T THINK
HE BELIEVES ME.

80
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:55,795
I THINK YOU OUGHT
TO COME DOWN HERE.

81
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:58,758
MOTHER, I'M IN COURT.
I CAN'T JUST DROP EVERYTHING.

82
00:02:58,758 --> 00:02:59,825
YOU KNOW THAT PIN

83
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:02,027
WAS THE LAST THING
THAT YOUR FATHER GAVE ME

84
00:03:02,027 --> 00:03:04,893
before he died,
but if you're too busy--
FINE, FINE, FINE.

85
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,606
I WILL BE THERE
IN A FEW MINUTES.

86
00:03:06,606 --> 00:03:08,697
JUST TRY AND BE CALM.
I AM CALM.

87
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:10,289
MALCOLM.

88
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,392
EXCUSE ME JUST A MOMENT,
MA'AM.

89
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:14,526
YES, YOU'RE EXCUSED.

90
00:03:16,308 --> 00:03:18,227
REMEMBER, THE FIRST THING
THAT HAPPENS

91
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:19,410
IS I DISARM
THE SECURITY GUARD.

92
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,665
THEN YOU GO
FOR THE DRAWER MONEY,

93
00:03:20,665 --> 00:03:21,609
I HIT THE VAULT DOWNSTAIRS
HEY...

94
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:24,300
I'M NO AMATEUR.

95
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,974
YEAH, ALL I'M SAYING

96
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:29,015
THANK YOU, SHEILA.

97
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:32,032
HI, I'M MALCOLM JONES.

98
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:33,903
OH, THE MANAGER...

99
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:35,308
(laughs) WOW.

100
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:36,990
UH, I DON'T THINK
I REALLY NEED THE--

101
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:38,675
THE BIG GUNS HERE.

102
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:40,251
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T GET YOUR NAME.

103
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:42,585
EGAN FOOTE,
WITH AN "E"--

104
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:44,225
NOT AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE "EGAN,"

105
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,968
BUT AT THE END
OF THE "FOOTE."

106
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,051
OKAY, HOW CAN I HELP YOU,
MR. FOOTE?

107
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:51,023
WELL, I WAS
SIMPLY CONSIDERING...

108
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:52,676
A LOAN FOR A BOAT--

109
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,252
A BOAT LOAN.chuckles)

110
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:56,812
AND I WAS JUST TELLING
SHEILA HERE--

111
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:57,539
BYE, SHEILA.

112
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:02,405
I HOPE I DIDN'T--
OH, NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

113
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:05,242
SHE'S JUST GOT PLANS
FOR THE LONG WEEKEND.
OH, THAT'S NICE.

114
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:07,235
SO IS IT A QUESTION
OF THE INTEREST RATE?

115
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:08,945
BECAUSE WE'RE
VERY COMPETITIVE.
IT'S MY WIFE.

116
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:12,032
SHE WOULDN'T LIKE IT.

117
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,237
WOULDN'T EVEN LIKE
THAT I'M HERE,

118
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:14,881
BUT I JUST THOUGHT--

119
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:16,932
I THOUGHT A BOAT
MIGHT HELP ME.

120
00:04:18,573 --> 00:04:20,407
I WENT SAILING ONCE
AS A KID.

121
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:23,102
IT FELT FREE.

122
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:29,262
WELL, UM...

123
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:33,151
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD GO HOME
AND DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR WIFE.

124
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,672
HEY, SHE JUST MIGHT
UNDERSTAND.

125
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:43,000
CAN I USE
YOUR RESTROOM, PLEASE?

126
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,127
SURE, ABSOLUTELY.

127
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:45,159

THIS IS GONNA CHANGE
EVERYTHING FOR US.

131
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:53,937
YEAH.

132
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:54,358

00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:04,722
(singsongy voice)

141
00:05:12,593 --> 00:05:14,464
IT'S CALLED "AXION,"
WITH AN "X."

142
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:16,449

WHY IS THAT?
FEWER TELLERS, FEWER FINGERS
LOOKING FOR ALARM BUTTONS.

150
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:40,647

UH, YOU KNOW,

161
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:05,655
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
COME IN HERE TO DO THIS.

162
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:07,829
YOU COULD USE
THE A.T.M. OUTSIDE.

163
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:10,380
OH.

164
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,561

00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:18,455

00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:41,137
I AM TELLING YOU, SOMEBODY

172
00:06:41,137 --> 00:06:44,134
MA'AM, MA'AM, I REALLY

00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:45,564
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU,

174
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:47,409
NO ONE HAS BEEN INSIDE
YOUR BOX.

175
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:50,888
DID YOU COME ALL THE WAY
DOWN HERE TO PATRONIZE ME?

176
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:51,964
NO, MOTHER. I'M SORRY.

183
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:07,806
TOTALLY DESIGNATED,

184
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:10,349
BUT HIS CAR DIED,
AND SO NOW THEY'RE GONNA

185
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:13,538
GIVE MY TICKET AWAY TO SOMEONE
WHO CAN PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION.

186
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:14,505
YOU WANNA BORROW THE CAR?

187
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:16,907
JARED'S 18

188
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:18,328
HONEY, LOOK...

196
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:32,383

197
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:47,325
(knock on door)

198
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,413
IS ANYBODY IN THERE?

199
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,928

202
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:10,992
(siren beeps)

203
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:11,590
LIZZIE, LIZZIE...

204
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,514
JEREMY, STOP ASKING.

205
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:15,483
COME ON.
THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME.

206
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:17,895
YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT,
IMPATIENT BOY.

207
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:19,543
OH, LOOK AT THIS.

208
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:21,455
I HAVE MONEY.
LET'S JUST GO.

209
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:23,847
YOU'RE NOT BUYING ME LUNCH,
NOT ON YOUR SALARY.

210
00:08:25,153 --> 00:08:25,769
(Jeremy) WHAT?

211
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:31,143

212
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,580
THANKS.

213
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:33,036

214
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:33,868
(bell dings)

215
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:35,255
SO, UM...

216
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,834
I WAS WONDERING,
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE--

217
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:38,643
SHE'D LOVE TO.

218
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,045
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

219
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:46,159

220
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:46,880
NO.

221
00:08:47,531 --> 00:08:48,252
WHO IS SHE?

222
00:08:48,614 --> 00:08:50,526
MY SISTER FRANNY.

223
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:54,836
THERE'S A COP HERE.

224
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,681
OH, I THINK
WE CAN HANDLE HIM.

225
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:00,375
NOT WITH
THE SECURITY GUARD, TOO.

226
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:02,474
WE SHOULD WAIT.
I KNOW, BUT IT WOULD BE
SO MUCH FASTER

227
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:03,653
IF PEOPLE
HAD THEIR CARDS OUT.

228
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:04,974
WHAT DO THEY THINK,
IT'S A CANDY MACHINE?

229
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:07,017
THEN THEY GET UP FRONT
AND THEY REALIZE,

230
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,729
OH, I NEED MONEY.
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

231
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:11,933
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALREADY.
LET'S JUST GO INSIDE.

232
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:13,844
I DON'T LIKE IT. WE SHOULD
COME BACK ANOTHER TIME.

233
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:16,392
THERE IS NO OTHER TIME.
 <i>NOW.</i>

234
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:18,345
I'LL TAKE THE SECURITY GUARD.

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,495
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

238
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:27,863
OH, I'M SORRY.

246
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,233
DON'T TRY TO BE
A HERO, MAN.

247
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,863
THIS WILL ALL BE OVER
IN FIVE MINUTES.

248
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,432

00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,570
BECAUSE TO THEM,
WE'RE ALL SUSPECTS.

340
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:11,787
(man) WE KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH A TERRIBLE ORDEAL,

341
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:13,860
AND WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
OUTTA HERE AS SOON AS WE CAN.

342
00:14:14,215 --> 00:14:16,318
BUT WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU NOW,
WHILE IT'S ALL

343
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:17,541
STILL FRESH IN YOUR MINDS.

344
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,638
BULLET WENT THROUGH THE CHEST.
HEART RATE'S IN THE 130s.

345
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:22,844
I PUT IN A CHEST TUBE
TO EVACUATE THE PNEUMOTHORAX.

346
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:24,804
WHAT DID YOU USE?
A PEN. IT'S ALL WE HAD.

347
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:26,057
SHE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

348
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:26,814
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE HAS
AN AORTA TEAR.

349
00:14:26,814 --> 00:14:29,453
I GOT IT FROM HERE.
O.R. ONE. LET'S MOVE. MOVE!

350
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,402
SHE'S ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN!
DID I SAY THAT?

351
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:38,750
(man) We've got the perp
Randall Reese

352
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,533
coming to you right now.

353
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,506
(man) Make sure he stays secured
to that gurney at all times.

354
00:14:42,556 --> 00:14:42,944
 <i>(mouths words)</i>

355
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:49,617
(man) DO YOU RECOGNIZE
ANY OF THESE MEN?

356
00:14:49,798 --> 00:14:50,963
THAT'S HIM. RANDALL REESE.

357
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,164
 <i>OH!</i>

358
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,315
FELICIA?

359
00:14:57,293 --> 00:15:00,066
WERE YOU AFRAID
FOR YOUR LIFE? MS. MILLER?

360
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:06,276
WE ALL WERE. RANDALL KILLED
THE SECURITY GUARD.

361
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:08,055
WE KNEW
WHAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF.

362
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:09,991
LOOK, I'VE I.D.'ed THESE GUYS
THREE TIMES.

363
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:12,073
NO MATTER WHAT COMBINATION
YOU SHOW ME,

364
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:14,712
THIS IS STILL RANDALL REESE
AND THIS IS STILL LUCAS DALTON.

365
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:17,246
NOW I WANT MY UPDATE
ON EVA RIOS.

366
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:20,217
WHAT IS TAKING THEM
SO DAMN LONG IN THERE?

367
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:23,606
(man) DR. KATES,
I'VE GOT MORE QUESTIONS.

368
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:24,745
YOU COMIN'?

369
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:29,347
an) YOU BROUGHT A GUN
INTO THE BANK ALSO?

370
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:31,112
I WAS GONNA KILL MYSELF.

371
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:32,902
NOT HERE. LATER.

372
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:34,218
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
THE L.A. RIVER BASIN,

373
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:36,440
YOU KNOW, WHERE THEY HAD
THAT DRAG RACE FROM "GREASE."

374
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:38,546
(man) AND LUCAS DALTON,
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

375
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,356
LUCAS IS MILITARY?

376
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:41,966
HIM. HE'S...

377
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,021
HE'S FAMILIAR, BUT...

378
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:47,352
I CAN'T PLACE IT.

379
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:50,034
I CAN'T.

380
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:53,967
DADDY,
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

381
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,687
(man) AND YOUR HAIR, MS. HALE,
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

382
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:57,604
SAME TIME AS THIS.

383
00:15:59,037 --> 00:16:00,014
IT WAS A TWO-FER.

384
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,213
MAY I SEE THOSE PENS,
PLEASE? THANK YOU.

385
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:06,946
WHO DID THAT TO YOU?
WAS IT REESE OR DALTON?

386
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:11,783
STICK WITH ME, OKAY?
AND THIS WILL BE OVER SOON.

387
00:16:11,783 --> 00:16:13,230
HEY, I DO THIS FOR A LIVING.
I'M FINE.

388
00:16:13,783 --> 00:16:15,518
DEPUTY DIRECTOR
ROGER MARSHALL, FBI.

389
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:17,373
I HAD THE PLAN TO END
THIS THING YESTERDAY.

390
00:16:17,373 --> 00:16:19,485
YOU GUYS BLEW IT.
YOU CHOKED.

391
00:16:19,535 --> 00:16:21,528
IT WAS A RISKY PLAN AT BEST,
AND THEN IT BECAME UNTENABLE.

392
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:23,734
AND THE NEXT TE YOU WANT
TO TAKE A SWING AT SOMEONE,

393
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:24,641
IT SHOULD BE ME.

394
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:26,064
I WAS THE ONE THAT MADE
THAT CALL.

395
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,437
IT WAS A BAD CALL.

396
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,511
OR MAYBE YOU AND KATHRYN HALE
WOULD'VE BEEN KILLED.

397
00:16:33,178 --> 00:16:34,022
BUT WE'LL NEVER KNOW, RIGHT?

398
00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:37,381
DID DETECTIVE CAVANAUGH MAKE
ANY EFFORT TO STOP THEM?

399
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:40,558
CHAINED TO A POLE, I'D SAY HE
DID EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

400
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:42,546
HE CERTAINLY WAS MORE PERSUASIVE
THAN YOU PEOPLE.

401
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:44,391
DID HE TRY TO PERSUADE
LUCAS DALTON

402
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:45,479
TO STOP RANDALL REESE?

403
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:47,777
THE ONLY WAY TO STOP
RANDALL REESE WAS TO KILL HIM,

404
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:50,425
AND LUCAS COULDN'T DO THAT.

405
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:51,303
WHY IS THAT?

406
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:54,806
RANDALL IS LUCAS'
OLDER BROTHER.

407
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,037
I WANNA FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPED TO EVA RIOS.

408
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,996
YOU HAVEN'T ASKED
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.
IS HE DEAD?

409
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:02,091
HAVEN'T HEARD. HIS CHANCES
AREN'T GOOD, THOUGH.

410
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,184
HE DIES, YOU KNOW
IT'S ALL ON YOU.

411
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:05,383
THAT'S FINE.
IT'S ALL ON ME.

412
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,650
SO IT WAYOUR PLAN?
YEAH.

413
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:09,586
AND NO ONE ELSE
WAS INVOLVED?

414
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,442
I'M NOT SAYIN' ANOTHER WORD
TILL I GET MY LAWYER.

415
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:15,186
I'D LIKE MY PHONE CALL, PLEASE,
AND THE NUMBER TO THE HOSPITAL.

416
00:17:15,236 --> 00:17:16,874
I'LL GET YOU WORD ON
YOUR BROTHER WHEN IT COMES.

417
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:19,554
I WANT TO FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO EVA RIOS.

418
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:19,224
(monitor beeping)

419
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:24,337
(medical team
speaking indistinctly)

420
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,527
(woman) HEY, EGAN!
(man) PRETTY GOOD STUFF,
EGAN.

421
00:17:27,577 --> 00:17:29,086
YOU'RE A HERO, EGAN.
HOW'S IT FEEL?

422
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:30,098
HERO?

423
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:32,307
HOW'S IT FEEL
TO BE A HERO?

424
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:33,273
HERO?

425
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:34,790
MR. FOOTE,
A STATEMENT, PLEASE.

426
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,493
IT--IT'S EGAN FOOTE,
WITH AN "E."

427
00:17:38,843 --> 00:17:40,018
HOW'S IT FEEL?

428
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:40,722
HOW DID YOU DO IT, SIR?

429
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:43,511
(Marshall)
PRETTY HARROWING EXPERIENCE.

430
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:48,768
I'VE SEEN YOUR FILE.
YOUR FATHER WAS A COP.

431
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,084
GOT HIMSELF
AND HIS PARTNER KILLED

432
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:53,373
BECAUSE HE WAS ON THE SAUCE.
NOW YOU--GAMBLING PROBLEM--

433
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,788
COST YOUR DEPARTMENT
A HUGE COLLAR.
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

434
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:58,163
WELL, CLEARLY, YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
ABOUT SOME OF OUR DECISIONS.

435
00:17:58,163 --> 00:18:00,473
YOU GO PUBLIC WITH THAT, WE'LL
GO RIGHT AT YOUR CREDIBILITY.

436
00:18:00,523 --> 00:18:02,871
WE'LL EVEN DRAG YOUR EX-WIFE OUT
OF THE WOODWORK IF WE HAVE TO.

437
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:03,559
I'M DONE HERE.

438
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:06,713
WE STILL NEED
TO GET YOUR STATEMENT.

439
00:18:07,245 --> 00:18:08,885
I JUST FEEL LIKE THERE ARE

440
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:10,739
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS
I SHOULD BE DOING.

441
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:12,548
I SHOULD BE AT THE HOSPITAL
WITH FRANNY.

442
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:14,863
I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER
SOCIAL WORKERS ON HAND THERE.

443
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:15,949
BUT I'M HER FRIEND.

444
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,281
I THOUGHT YOU ONLY KNEW
JEREMY KATES.

445
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:20,232
LOOK... I WOKE UP,
I WENT TO WORK,

446
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:21,816
IT WAS A REGULAR DAY.

447
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:24,668
AND THEN I ENDED UP
IN THERE WITH...

448
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,636
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.

449
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,783
MOST OF US DIDN'T KNOW
EACH OTHER AT ALL.

450
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,776
BUT AFTER
WHAT WE WENT THROUGH...

451
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:34,966
FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES, I--

452
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,498
I DON'T KNOW.

453
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:39,241
NOW CAN I PLEASE GO?

454
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:42,801
HEY.
HI.

455
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:43,812
ANY WORD YET?

456
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:46,253
NOT YET.

457
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:48,289
HOW IS SHE?

458
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:49,152
WE DON'T KNOW.

459
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:51,973
(door clicks)

460
00:18:59,746 --> 00:19:00,529
WHAT?

461
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:05,557
WHAT?

462
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:08,267
(sobs)

463
00:19:07,987 --> 00:19:08,764
WHAT?
I'M--

464
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:10,519
I'M SO SORRY, FRANNY.

465
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:12,691
(crying)
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

466
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:14,883
OH, MY GOD.

467
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:19,941
(crying)

468
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,517
OH, MY GOD.
FRANNY, YOU'RE HERE.

469
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:38,822
RICKY'S BEEN ASKING
FOR HIS MOM.

470
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:41,670
I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
TO TELL HIM. WHERE IS SHE?

471
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,333
CAN I HAVE
THE SPARE KEYS, PLEASE?

472
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:44,587
(keys jingling)

473
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:54,171
EVA'S DEAD.

474
00:19:54,787 --> 00:19:55,598
UM...

475
00:19:57,853 --> 00:19:58,624
SHE DIED.

476
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:03,607
IS RICKY OKAY
FOR THE NIGHT?

477
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:05,685
YEAH, OF COURSE.

478
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:06,556
THANK YOU.

479
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,163
MA, I CAN'T HEAR YOU

480
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:12,691
WHEN YOU AND DAD TALK
AT THE SAME TIME.

481
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:13,989
I PROMISE
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

482
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:17,388
YES, LIZZIE'S HERE WITH ME.

483
00:20:17,438 --> 00:20:18,377
SHE'S STAYING HERE TONIGHT.

484
00:20:19,772 --> 00:20:20,831
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

485
00:20:21,273 --> 00:20:22,705
(telephone beeps)

486
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:24,733
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN SEE THEM TOMORROW.

487
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:26,597
IT'S NO PRESSURE.

488
00:20:29,486 --> 00:20:30,378
(sighs) WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

489
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:33,675
YOU'RE A VEGETARIAN.

490
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,150
I WANTED BACON.

491
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,257
DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT?
ABOUT WHAT?

492
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:45,710
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
IN THERE.

493
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,048
A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENED
IN THERE.

494
00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:49,522
IT WAS A MOMT, LIZZIE.

495
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:52,657
A MOMENT.

496
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,297
DOES IT
HAVE TO MEAN EVERYTHING?

497
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:05,701
 <i>(man) POLICE ARE NOW</i>
 <i>JUST RELEASING THE NAMES</i>

498
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:07,023
 <i>OF THE NINE HOSTAGES...</i>

499
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:14,916
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

500
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:17,314
I HATE THIS SHIRT.
(laughs)

501
00:21:18,932 --> 00:21:19,517
I ALWAYS HAVE.

502
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:21,365
(laughs)

503
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:22,526
YOU'RE THROWING IT AWAY?

504
00:21:23,174 --> 00:21:24,860
ALL OF THAT STUFF
IN THE GARBAGE?

505
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,765
NO, NO, NO. I'LL BRING 'EM
TO GOODWILL IN THE MORNING.

506
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:29,985
I WANT NEW DUDS, MARY.
DUDS?

507
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:33,458
YEAH! WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
WE WENT SHOPPING?
EGAN, YOU'RE BEING CRAZY.

508
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:34,352

687
00:31:34,343 --> 00:31:36,481
SO I HEARD YOU PUNCHED OUT
THE NEGOTIATOR THE OTHER NIGHT.

688
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:39,423
PUNCHED, YEAH.
OUT, NO. UNFORTUNATELY.

689
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:41,930
YOU GETTING A HARD TIME
ABOUT IT
NOT YET.

690
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:45,030
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU SAID IN YOUR STATEMENT,

691
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,911
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO MAKE AN ISSUE

692
00:31:46,911 --> 00:31:47,774
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
ON THE OUTSIDE,

693
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:48,615
I'LL BACK YOU UP.

694
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:49,815
EXCUSE M MR. JONES.

00:31:50,391 --> 00:31:51,386
DEPUTY D.A. ED NIELSON.

696
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:53,883
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE
SO SIMPLE FOR YOU.

697
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:57,314
I WORK WITH KATHRYN.

698
00:31:57,364 --> 00:31:58,427
SIMPLE'S OVERRATED.

699
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:01,428
ARE YOU NICK?

700
00:32:02,218 --> 00:32:03,156
YEAH, YOU MUST BE RICKY.

701
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:05,444
ARE YOU THE COP?
YEP.

702
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,001
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAVE
MY MOM?

703
00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:13,409
HEY, RICKY, I FOUND
THE DVD. LET'S GO WATCH IT.

704
00:32:15,316 --> 00:32:16,082

706
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:29,640
(Jeremy) YOU ALL RIGHT?

707
00:32:31,144 --> 00:32:32,230
YEAH.

708
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:41,049
 <i>(music continues)</i>

709
00:32:42,762 --> 00:32:44,206
I'M REALLY SORRY
I COULDN'T DO MORE.

710
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,288
LOOK, SHE WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN ALIVE

711
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:49,156
AS LONG AS SHE WAS
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.

712
00:32:55,504 --> 00:32:57,045
CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE LEFT ME.

713
00:33:01,423 --> 00:33:02,540
AND I FEEL SO ALONE.

714
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:06,653
I KNOW.

715
00:33:14,782 --> 00:33:17,715
 <i>(man singing ballad</i>
 <i>in Spanish)</i>

716
00:33:37,411 --> 00:33:38,411
PLEASE.

717
00:34:00,068 --> 00:34:01,741
HI, MALCOLM.
IT'S SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.

718
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:03,420
HEY, SHEILA.
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.

719
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,412
WE'RE SEEING POTENTIAL
NEW RECRUITS TODAY,

720
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:05,865
IS THAT RIGHT?

721
00:34:05,865 --> 00:34:06,602
(Sheila) STARTING AT 2:00.

722
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:07,056
GREAT.

723
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:28,952
(man) HEY, DALTON.

724
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:30,339
YOUR BROTHER'S
OUT OF HIS COMA.

725
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:32,090
TOO BAD HE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

726
00:34:34,526 --> 00:34:36,149
 <i>THERE IS NO OTHER TIME.</i>
 <i>NOW.</i>

727
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:40,210
THERE YOU GO.

728
00:34:40,805 --> 00:34:41,544
THANKS, DETECTIVE.

729
00:34:41,594 --> 00:34:42,837
THIS IS GONNA BE
REAL HELPFUL.

730
00:34:50,337 --> 00:34:50,903
HEY, PETE.

731
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:55,206
WHEN'S MY HEARING?
IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK.

732
00:34:55,256 --> 00:34:57,255
I WAS JUST WONDERING WHEN
I WAS GONNA BE REINSTATED.
LET'S GO INSIDE.

733
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,755
YOU'RE SCAPEGOATING ME,
AREN'T YOU?
NICK, YOU'RE NOT
BEING SCAPE--

734
00:35:00,755 --> 00:35:01,418
NO, IT'S JUST PERFECT.

735
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,560
LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON, RIGHT?
IT'S A GREAT STORY.

736
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,533
YOU'RE NOT HAVING A HEARING

737
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:05,882
BECAUSE WE DECIDED
YOU DON'T NEED A HEARING.

738
00:35:07,537 --> 00:35:09,059
YOU'RE GONNA BE REINSTATED
RIGHT AWAY.

739
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:11,006
YOU'RE BEING GIVEN
THE MEDAL OF DISTINCTION.

740
00:35:11,392 --> 00:35:13,857
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR PROMOTION.
WHAT'S THE CATCH?

741
00:35:14,786 --> 00:35:16,447
KEEP YOUR OPINIONS
TO YOURSELF.

742
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:17,621
AND IF I DON'T?

743
00:35:19,028 --> 00:35:20,521
THIS IS A BIG CHANCE
FOR YOU, NICK,

744
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,890
TO GET RID
OF SOME OLD GHOSTS.

745
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:23,082
(Beth Orton's "Thinking
About Tomorrow" playing)

746
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:29,416
* TIRED,
BUT I AIN'T SLEEPIN' *

747
00:35:31,316 --> 00:35:37,416
* THINKIN' ABOUT
SOME SAD AAIR *

748
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:42,249
* AND WHY
I SHOULD BE LEAVING *

749
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:44,543
THERE ARE PLACES
THAT DO THAT, YOU KNOW,

750
00:35:44,927 --> 00:35:45,737
FOR YOU.

751
00:35:49,626 --> 00:35:50,451
YOU ALL RIGHT?

752
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:51,288
YEAH, I'M FINE.

753
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:54,314
I HEARD WE JUST LOST
CARLA BARRETT.

754
00:35:54,684 --> 00:35:56,211
WELL, SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE
THAT WE COULD PROTECT HER.

755
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:58,282
WELL, I THOUGHT
OUR STANCE ON HER

756
00:35:58,299 --> 00:35:59,848
WAS SHE KNEW
WHAT SHE WAS GETTING INTO--

757
00:36:00,262 --> 00:36:01,622
THE DIAMONDS, THE FURS.

758
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:03,847
I'M NOT GONNA FORCE HER
TO TESTIFY

759
00:36:03,897 --> 00:36:04,964
IF SHE DOESN'T FEEL SAFE.

760
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:07,291
WELL, I WISH YOU WOULD'VE
RUN IT BY ME BEFORE...

761
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:15,433
YOU WANT SOME HELP
WITH THE BACK?

762
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:16,867
NO, THANKS. I GOT IT.

763
00:36:20,421 --> 00:36:22,228
(woman)
WHEN I FIRST GOT DIAGNOSED,

764
00:36:22,704 --> 00:36:24,698
EVERYONE RUSHED TO MY SIDE.

765
00:36:25,306 --> 00:36:26,568
YOU GET PHONE CALLS,

766
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,957
FLOWERS AND SUPPORT.

767
00:36:29,747 --> 00:36:30,459
RIGHT?

768
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:35,897
AND IT'S THIS
REALLY AMAZING EXPERIENCE--

769
00:36:35,947 --> 00:36:38,154
SO MUCH LOVE.

770
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:41,135
AND THEN AS SOON AS I STARTED
TO GET BETTER,

771
00:36:41,185 --> 00:36:43,120
EVERYONE WENT BACK
TO THEIR LIVES.

772
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:45,975
AND I FELT LIKE...

773
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:49,075
LIKE A LOT OF THAT LOVE
WENT WITH THEM,

774
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,395
LIKE THE LOVE FORGOT ME.

775
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,573
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
I COME HERE

776
00:36:54,426 --> 00:36:56,243
TO SEE YOU PEOPLE
EVERY WEEK,

777
00:36:57,376 --> 00:36:59,725
'CAUSE I DON'T
WANNA BE FORGOTTEN.

778
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,493
AND I DON'T WANT TO FORGET.

779
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,597
EGAN, WELCOME BACK.

780
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:12,625
HEY, THERE'S RAMBO.

781

00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:26,782
* WILL IT

786
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:29,782

* YOU KNOW THE LIGHT
AIN'T FADING FROM YOU *

790
00:37:41,149 --> 00:37:43,882
* NOTHING COULD SAVE ME
FROM YOU *

791
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:46,715
* SO LONG *

792
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:48,562
I HEARD YOU WERE BACK.

793
00:37:51,117 --> 00:37:51,749

WHAT FOR, GROUP THERAPY?

799
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,220
NO, IT'S...

800

WE'RE GOING TO MEET
AT JIM'S COUNTER

801
00:38:07,215 --> 00:38:08,368
SO WE CAN SEE EACH OTHER.

802
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,824

803
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:10,849

YEAH, I ALREADY ATE.

815
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:45,166
OH, NOT A PROBLEM.

00:38:48,301 --> 00:38:49,755
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE,

817
00:38:49,755 --> 00:38:50,850

818
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,398

(Egan) IT'S A LITTLE BIT

(Egan) NO, NOT YET.
I LIKE YOUR HAIR THAT WAY.

834
00:39:31,922 --> 00:39:34,565
THAT ABSTRACT THING WAS KINDA
CONFUSING PEOPLE AT WORK.

835
00:39:34,565 --> 00:39:37,357
THEY'RE USED TO ME BEING
VERY CUT-AND-DRY.
IS THAT SO?

836
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,441
ED WANTS ME TO TAKE
A COUPLE OF DAYS OFF.

837
00:39:39,491 --> 00:39:41,041
HE THINKS I'M GOING SOFT.

838
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:42,550
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT,
NOW CAN WE?

839
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:43,996

OH, MY GOD.

847
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:04,515

848
00:40:05,982 --> 00:40:08,648
(laughs)

849
00:40:09,351 --> 00:40:10,651
I'M SORRY.

850
00:40:10,383 --> 00:40:12,282

851
00:40:14,942 --> 00:40:16,942
(laughs)
DID YOU SEE... EGAN?

852
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:20,018
HE ALMOST JUMPED UP
AND BODY BLOCKED THE WAITRESS.

853
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:20,901
(Malcolm)
DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM.

854
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:25,557
(Franny) JEREMY.

855
00:40:25,607 --> 00:40:26,612
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

856
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:28,722
HI. YOU CAME.
YEAH.

857
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:29,666
ARE YOU UNK?

858
00:40:29,716 --> 00:40:30,753
MAYBE.

859
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:32,381
(Jeremy) I'M SORRY
I HAVEN'T CALLED YOU.

860
00:40:32,922 --> 00:40:34,445
I HAVEN'T
CALLED YOU EITHER.

861
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,522
WE SHOULD PROBABLY TALK,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

862
00:40:36,672 --> 00:40:38,433
ABOUT WHAT?
COME ON, I'M STARVED.

863
00:40:40,777 --> 00:40:43,703
IF MY WIFE KNEW I WAS
EATING FRENCH FRIES...

864
00:40:43,753 --> 00:40:45,863
LOOK WHO I RAN INTO
OUTSIDE.
HEY!

865
00:40:45,182 --> 00:40:45,648
(Franny laughs)

866
00:40:47,473 --> 00:40:50,060
(Egan) HI.
HEY.

867
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:52,281
SO I WAS AT HAPPY HOUR,

868
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:53,749
WITH MY FRIENDS...

869
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:56,013
AND THEY WANTED TO COME
AND MEET YOU GUYS,

870
00:40:56,063 --> 00:40:57,916
BUT I TOLD 'EM
IT WAS A PRIVATE PARTY--

871
00:40:58,271 --> 00:40:59,606
HOSTAGES ONLY.

872
00:40:59,656 --> 00:41:01,387
OH, THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

873
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:02,260
VERY FUNNY.

874
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:05,302
YOU WERE GOING
TO TELL ME SOMETHING.

875
00:41:05,845 --> 00:41:06,832
HMM?

876
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:09,756
BEFORE WE WENT INTO
THE BANK.
OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

877
00:41:09,756 --> 00:41:11,891
WOW, EVERYBODY CAME.

878
00:41:12,545 --> 00:41:14,769
(Egan) ALMOST.
OH, WAIT,
WHERE'S FELICIA?

879
00:41:15,195 --> 00:41:17,764
SHE HAD SOME PARTY TO GO TO,
WHICH I WAS GLAD ABOUT.

880
00:41:17,764 --> 00:41:19,285
BUT SHE SAID TO SAY HELLO
TO EVERYBODY,

881
00:41:19,285 --> 00:41:20,795
SO HELLO FROM FELICIA.
TELL HER WE SAID HI.

882
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:23,519
(Egan) MAYBE SHE'LL, UM,
SHE'LL JOIN US NEXT TIME.

883
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:24,882
***

884
00:41:29,149 --> 00:41:32,016
(door lock buzzes)

885
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:36,016
(buzz)

886
00:42:11,548 --> 00:42:12,871
HI.

887
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:32,383
