1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,950
it wasan ordinary day.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,470
There were nine of us,
most of us strangers.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,330
We were all in the bank...

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,810
let's do this thing.

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,930
All for different reasons.
And then...

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,330
now.

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,740
In an instant,
our lives changed.

8
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,760
This will all be over
in five minutes.

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,040
52 hours later,

10
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,560
we came out of there
no longer strangers...

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,510
what are you doing here?

12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,400
It occurred to me that maybe
you could e some company.

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,190
You haven't been goingto your G.A. Meetings.
The department mandated six.

14
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,450
I did my six.
I haven't laid a bet in three months.

15
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,490
Bonded forever
by what we went through.

16
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,330
Do you remember going to visit
mr. Dalton in jail three weeks ago?

17
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,560
- Hello.
- What is it?

18
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,430
felicia broke into the bank.

19
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,390
I know that I made the 9-1-1 call.
How could you not tell me?

20
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,400
I'm pregnant.

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,460
I take my responsibility
very seriously.

22
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,350
- Why do you keep on coming here?
- You've become important to me.

23
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,760
It might do you some good
to really be where you are.

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,030
That sounds a lot like something you might say
to someone you're in a relationship with.

25
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,060
look,I know what
you went through together.

26
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,870
No,I don't think you do.

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,280
Do you even have any idea
what you are getting into with this guy?

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,540
Is there something
we all need to talk about?

29
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,690
What happened in there?

30
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,420
TAKE ME INSTEAD

31
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,180
HOUR 2    4:27 PM

32
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,990
none of you people smoke?

33
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,450
I don't have any.

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,660
well,tom,you look a little better.
How do you feel?

35
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,090
My head hurts.

36
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,840
All right,you've still got to
stay down,okay? Take it easy.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,680
- it's mine.
- Lizzie...

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,830
it's mine.

39
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,420
I told you
to turn it off.

40
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,750
- I know.
- I got it.

41
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,190
uh,I-I can...

42
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,150
wait.

43
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,880
here.

44
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,700
Somebody needs to get me
a damn cigarette.

45
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,620
Forget the cigarette.
Please just stop that damn phone!

46
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,930
What's that you say?
I can't hear you.

47
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,990
Please don'T.
She's having--

48
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,830
you don't want
to keep 'em hanging.

49
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,720
Shut up,cop.

50
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,430
You got a team full of negotiators
out there ready to work for you.

51
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,980
Ask 'em for a car,a chopper,
a private plane,whatever you want.

52
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,160
somehow I don't think
I'm gonna get whatever I want.

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,920
You start sending out hostages,
you will.

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,740
Nobody's leaving here
before we do.

55
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,380
You got ten people in here.
Send out one,get some smokes.

56
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,600
It's one less person to cover.

57
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,410
Give up a hostage
for a pack of cigarettes?

58
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,210
Ask for something you want,
see if they're gonna cooperate.

59
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,260
At least start the process.

60
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,480
Otherwise,we're all gonna be
sitting here staring at each other

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,640
until we run out of time.

62
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,210
we want to make a trade.
Cigarettes and some food.

63
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,830
We'll give you one.

64
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,150
No,we'll decide.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,070
So who wants out,huh?

66
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,500
Step right up!

67
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,890
Hey,we should talk
about this.

68
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,560
No,no!
Let's see what they think.

69
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,820
Any volunteers?

70
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,660
The security guard.
Wounded go first.

71
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,860
Security guard stays.

72
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,070
Come on.
Don't be shy.

73
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,420
Who wants out?

74
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,650
mother,don't say anything.
It's not up to us.

75
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,300
- Hey,randall.
- What?

76
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,950
It's a democracy.
How about a show of hands?

77
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,600
- But he's hurt.
- Just put your hand up.

78
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,870
So you want out?

79
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,450
Of course she wants out.
We all want out.

80
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,020
Take my sister!
She has a little boy at home.

81
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,980
Sisters,huh?

82
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,600
Well,

83
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,080
we are definitely not
separating you two.

84
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,210
Then send 'em both.

85
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,850
That's two less people
you gotta worry about.

86
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,230
- Nobody asked you,cop.
- That's enough!

87
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,460
Hey,ty-d bol man,
how about you?

88
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,250
You want out?

89
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,690
What,you don't care?
You don't want to be free?

90
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,730
I think you should let somebody
else go,one of the women.

91
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,300
Children are first to go.

92
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,790
My daughter's back there
somewhere.

93
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,950
She should go.

94
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,800
Try that one.

95
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,180
Felicia,honey.

96
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,950
It's okay.
It's okay,baby.

97
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,070
It's okay.

98
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,470
Come on out.

99
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,510
Everything's gonna be okay.

100
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,890
We're gonna get you
out of here.

101
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,520
Look at me.
I promise,okay?

102
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,450
Come on with me
so we can get you home.

103
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,900
It's all right,baby.
You're goin' home.

104
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,300
we got her.

105
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,860
What the hell was
she doing in here?

106
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,350
She was hiding.
It's all right.

107
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,130
- So you want to send her?
- She's a kid.

108
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,120
Yeah,a kid with
a pink cell phone.

109
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,410
La dee dah.

110
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,710
You're the one
who did this?

111
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,330
- Now wait a minute.
- Dad--dad...

112
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,590
she didn't know
what she was doing.

113
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,000
All those cops out there
pointing their guns at us--

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,160
we would have been
out of here by now!

115
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,700
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,910
God!

117
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,420
There is no way
we're sending her out,

118
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,300
'cause she is what's gonna
keep the big man in line.

119
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,560
Hold on. The cops already
know she's in here.

120
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,810
They would have
traced her cell.

121
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,220
The best way to earn yourself
some good will,send out a kid.

122
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,040
We gotta get
this cop outta here.

123
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,560
Now wait a minute.
Just wait a minute!

124
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,920
I have been on the other side
of these standoffs.

125
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,530
I know exactly what
they're thinking out there.

126
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,790
I know exactly what
their next move's gonna be.

127
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,350
You got a line of S.W.A.T.
Out there

128
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,900
just dying to take over
from the negotiators,

129
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,290
and i am the guy that can keep
them working with you.

130
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,880
You need me in here.

131
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,050
He's right!

132
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,160
I mean,we've all seen
the movies.

133
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,190
If they've got a cop
in here,

134
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,240
they're less likely to come in
with their guns blazing.

135
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,590
Now if you're not gonna take the injured guy,
you're not gonna take the girl,

136
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,610
take her. What's your name?

137
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,630
- na-nancy hale.
- Take nancy.

138
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,900
She's the oldest.
That's gonna win you points out there.

139
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,310
Besides,she's been driving you crazy
since this whole thing started.

140
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,710
Tie me up if you want to,
handcuff me.

141
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,000
But keep me in here.

ONE MONTH LATER

146
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,320
- How's it going?
- Hey.

147
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,720
Making up
a little,uh,tortilla soup.

148
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,620
So you,uh,
never came home last night.

149
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,000
I was on a stakeout.

150
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,020
I called the station a couple of times,
left some messages.

151
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,830
Egan,you had a wife.
I had a wife.

152
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,950
We got rid of 'em.
Let's not be wives.

153
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,220
Just a concerned friend...

154
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,730
not a wife.

155
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,810
I thought you were looking
for your own place. How's that going?

156
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,050
Stalled for the moment.
The geo's in the shop.

157
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,380
I'll take you.

158
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,740
All right. You sure?

159
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,280
I-I don't want to be a bother
on your day off.

160
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,000
It's no bother,really.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,140
all right,I got it.
I got it.

162
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,770
Cavanaugh residence.

163
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,480
Hey,egan.
It's kathryn.

164
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,910
Kathryn hale...

165
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,070
ho ho. Well,to what
do I owe this pleasure?

166
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,020
Well,actually I was hoping
to get ahold of nick.

167
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,040
Oh,of course.
Uh,yeah,he's right her hold on.

168
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,500
Oh,uh,wait a second.

169
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,350
by the way,I'm having some people over
to play poker here tomorrow night.

170
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,310
I don't,uh,suppose
you'd be available?

171
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,470
Oh,I wish I could,
but I actually have this thing with ed.

172
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,890
well,what
a grave disappointment.

173
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,580
A poker party?

174
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,340
Yeah,I found your chips.
I figured,"hey,you play!"

175
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,900
- How's it going?
- Okay. You?

176
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,440
Working hard,you know?

177
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,580
So you know what?
Listen...

178
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,680
I know that this is not
the st brilliant timing,

179
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,010
but my mother has been
after me every day about this lunch thing,

180
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,900
you know,
so she can finally thank you.

181
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,900
If you,you know,if you have it in you
for another hero ceremony...

182
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,970
yeah,I think
I can manage it.

183
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,320
Really?

184
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,730
If it'll lighten your load.

185
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,240
Uh,god,thank you.
I can be there as a buffer if you need me.

186
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,440
Uh,please.

187
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,230
Uh,how about tomorrow around 1:00
at the,uh,orange tree caf? on third?

188
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,560
With bells on.

189
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,470
Good.
All right,I'll see you then.

190
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,140
I'll see you.

191
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,050
what's with the alarm?

192
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,940
Mom said it's been going off
all day.

193
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,960
I tried that. Yeah,could you
just send someone out here?

194
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm off in a minute.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,760
What are you reading?

196
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,890
***************
Schoolwork

197
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,370
on a friday night,huh?

198
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,790
Well,what else
am I supposed to do?

199
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm under house arrest.

200
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,950
Well,that's what happens when
you lie to us,young lady,so no pouting.

201
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,140
Dinner's ready to go on the stove,baby.
And you can just order something for tomorrow.

202
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,190
We will be fine.

203
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,550
Just have a good trip and make sure you call
as soon as you get there,okay?

204
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,990
And the alarm company's
supposed to call back. I left the number.

205
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,790
I got it.

206
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,110
Okay,I love you. Mm.

207
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,450
I love you,too.

208
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,370
Be good now.

209
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,490
- bye.
- Bye-bye.

210
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,990
How long
is this gonna last?

211
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,200
Felicia,you went to a men's prison.
Then you broke into the bank.

212
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,260
I think we've got every reason in e world
to keep you around for a while.

213
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,010
Come on now.
It doesn't have to be that bad,

214
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,630
spending the weekend
with your father,does it?

215
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,980
Let's have some dinner.

216
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,560
I'm lizzie miller.

217
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,380
I was hoping
to see lucas.

218
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,220
Lift your arms for me.

219
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,800
Don't you need to ask him
if it's okay?

220
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,280
He's been expecting you.

221
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,930
- Can I help?
- That's okay. I got it.

222
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,220
I just found out they're
moving you back to county.

223
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,520
day after tomorrow.

224
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,750
Should be a party.

225
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,340
They let me in.

226
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,740
They said
you were expecting me?

227
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,060
Yeah.
I was.

228
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,850
A couple weeks ago.

229
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,320
The D.A.'S office told us not
to have any contact with you,

230
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,810
that it could hurt the case.

231
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,040
But you came anyway?

232
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Well,I appreciate
what you did.

233
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,990
- We all do.
- Ambassador of the group,

234
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,650
just passing on the message.

235
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,030
What do you want me
to say?

236
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,100
Nothing.

237
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,740
You said your piece.
You're good to go.

238
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,280
All right,well,just make sure
that gets filed tonight,

239
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,380
and send me the e-mail,
and I'll look over it.

240
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,590
Thanks--thanks,rachel.
I'll,uh...

241
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,740
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

242
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,580
- hey there.
- Hey.

243
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,040
You,uh...

244
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,660
you said "dinner."

245
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,100
You didn't say
that you were decorating.

246
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,170
Champagne?

247
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,120
Take this.
Give me this.

248
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,830
Thank you.

249
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,050
Ed,what is--
what is all this?

250
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,250
We've been at this
for four years now.

251
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,940
We've danced around
each other.

252
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,960
We've gone full throttle,
half throttle.

253
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,420
Sometimes I wanted
to throttle you.

254
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,970
But something happened
to me

255
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,710
when I got the call that you were one of
the people inside that bank,

256
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,180
when I had to confront the possibility
of living the rest of my life without you.

257
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:34,140
Two days later,when you came walking
out of there and back to me...

258
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:42,030
I promised myself
that I would never risk losing you again.

259
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,820
I'm sorry.
I'm--excuse me.

260
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,390
Now if you're not gonna take the injured guy,
you're not gonna take the girl,take her.

261
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,170
- What's your name?
- Na-nancy hale.

262
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,300
Take nancy. She's the oldest.
That's gonna win you points out there.

263
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,520
Besides,she's been driving you crazy
since this whole thing started.

264
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,630
Tie me up if you want to,
handcuff me.

265
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,510
But keep me in here.

266
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,720
showtime,lady.
Let's go!

267
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,800
I'm so sorry I called you.
You shouldn't even be here.

268
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,600
Get back.

269
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,460
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine,okay?

270
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,040
she's coming out.
First she ings the stuff back,

271
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,930
hands if off at the door,
then we let her go. You got that?

272
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,480
Wait a minute.
She needs her purse.

273
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,350
She needs her purse.Hey!
Just give me one minute--

274
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,210
katie!

275
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,990
- Mom,mom!

276
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,590
- let her go!

277
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,100
- Let her go!
- My baby!

278
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,800
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine!

279
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,450
No!
No,let her go!Mom,you're gonna be fine!

280
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,900
Let her go. Let her go!

281
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,770
Let go of me!

282
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,740
mom,mom,just go!
You need to go! Look at me!

283
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,980
One more word
out of you,lady!

284
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,760
One more word!

285
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,710
Don't do this toe!

286
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,590
look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

287
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,410
Don't do this to me!

288
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,140
she can't hear you.

289
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,660
It's okay.

290
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,100
tell me
what's happening.

291
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,960
it's okay. She's going.

292
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,920
- oh my god
- what is it?

293
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,130
Everything's fine. She's almost there.
She's being very brave.

294
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,490
What the hell is she doing?

295
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,670
- Now what?
- Everything is fine.

296
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,010
She's just getting the stuff.

297
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,080
No.
No...

298
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,480
no,katie!

299
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,490
No,no,no! What the hell?
Stay with me.

300
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,430
Katie,no!
Please,let me go!

301
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,140
what the hell?
What are they doing?

302
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,160
- What is happening?
- Stay with me!

303
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,030
You've got to
let me go,please!

304
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,820
God!

305
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,420
It's okay. They've got her.
They've got her. It's fine.

306
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,960
- Don't!
- Damn it!

307
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,600
She's okay. She's fine.

308
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,060
damn...

309
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,320
she's safe. She's safe.

310
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,520
I'm sorry to call you in
on a saturday.

311
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,990
If you would renew
my prescription over the phone,then I would--

312
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,160
well,I thought this was
a nice opportunity to catch up

313
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,720
since I haven't
heard from you in over a mon.

314
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,160
Anything big happen?

315
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,490
Lydia,look,I already told you,
I don't want to talk about the bank.

316
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,880
I don't want to talk about anything.
I just need more zenatan.

317
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,140
Kathryn...

318
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,000
what?

319
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,040
What's going on?

320
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,780
Ed proposed to me
last night.

321
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,530
Or tried to,and then I...

322
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,120
I just...

323
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,090
I couldn't breathe.

324
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,750
He started to say the words,
and I just... I couldn'T...

325
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,960
I couldn't get any air.

326
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,800
And what happened?

327
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,910
I hid in the bathroom
until I was calm

328
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,060
and then...

329
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,030
by the time I came out
to apologize...

330
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,990
ed was incredibly understanding
as always,

331
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,090
and he just--I don't know,
he said we could table it.

332
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,980
So things are...

333
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,310
yeah,back to normal,
whatever that means.

334
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,390
Have you been having the attacks
again since the bank?

335
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,100
No,actually that...

336
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,910
that one was the first.

337
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,520
So what we're saying is,

338
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,970
bank trauma,no problem,
marriage proposal,big problem?

339
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,210
- It's not marriage.
- Then what? Is it ed?

340
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,660
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

341
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:44,360
There is someone
from the bank.

342
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,640
I've only known him
for a couple weeks,

343
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,240
but I've been thinking
about him,

344
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,310
which is so ridiculous,
because I've known ed for four years!

345
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:02,120
And I go through this thing
with this guy for two days,and I...

346
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,590
well,let's be honest.
You've always been ambivalent about ed,

347
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,120
and I never thought it had
anything to do with ed.

348
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,860
But that's the thing...

349
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,050
is that...

350
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:22,340
since the bank,
I have been open to ed and needing ed.

351
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,250
And it's been okay.

352
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,050
But then there's
this other man.

353
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,380
yeah.

354
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,640
Nick.

355
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,230
hello?

356
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,780
Hey,how's it going?
It's jeremy.

357
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,150
Hey,what's up?

358
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,920
I was just checking in to see if you got inted
tohat poker game over at nick's tonight.

359
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,490
Yeah,egan called,
but I don't really play cards,though,so...

360
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,780
I don't know.

361
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,830
Yeah,same here.

362
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,230
But... there's this party
over at my neighbor's house.

363
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,940
It's a charity thing.
He's a music industry guy.

364
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,000
I think it'll be pretty fun.

365
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,750
I was,well,wondering
if you'd want to go.

366
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,040
Um,sure.
That'd be cool.

367
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,270
All right.

368
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,510
Well,it starts around 10:00.

369
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:26,230
I was thinking that maybe
I could pick you up around 80

370
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,460
and,uh...

371
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,810
and we could grab
some dinner first,

372
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,110
unless you wanted to
just meet me there.

373
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,950
No,no,no.
Dinner would be great.

374
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,130
Okay,great.
I'll see you tomorrow.

375
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,670
Okay.

376
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,860
Thanks again for doing this.
It means a lot to her.

377
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,620
Hey,it's a step up
from the diner.

378
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,480
Oh,I'm supposed
to say hello from egan.

379
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,780
He's,uh,pretty devastated
you're not coming to this thing tonight.

380
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,940
Thank you.

381
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,980
Poker,huh?

382
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,030
Yeah.

383
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,020
No,I-I just was a little surprised.
I didn't think that you did that anymore.

384
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,310
Look,whatever you heard
from ed was overstated.

385
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,030
Oh,thanks. I had a bad period
last year after my divorce.

386
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,700
I made a few mistakes,
played with some people I shouldn't have,

387
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,610
but that's it. It's over.

388
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,380
Anyway,it was egan's idea.
We're playing for nickels.

389
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,310
You should come.

390
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,070
oh,I am so sorry.

391
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,510
The driver insisted
on taking the 405.

392
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,920
Oh,well.

393
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,980
Ah,good.Thank you,enrique.
We'll have the champagne now.

394
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,510
oh,mom,
that's not really necessary.

395
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,370
Well,you're not on duty,
are you?

396
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,590
Nope. Day off.

397
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,240
Good,then I insist.

398
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,210
I'm appallingly overdue in paying tribute to this
man's heroism,and I intend to do so properly.

399
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,590
You know,I'm not sure
I deserve to be--

400
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,420
I will have
none of your modesty.

401
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,870
You were coolheaded and shrewd,

402
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,470
certainly more so than those flak-jacketed brutes

403
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,080
that dragged me off the plaza.

404
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,140
Aha,here we are.
Oh,this is lovely.

405
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,040
Yeah?
Well...

406
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,940
To detective nicholas cavanaugh,

407
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,680
who saved my life,

408
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,550
and to my daughter kathryn,

409
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,110
who is finally beginning hers.

410
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,410
What are you talking about?

411
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:09,490
Oh,dear. Did things
not go as planned? I...

412
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,730
I'm sorry.
Did I miss something?

413
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,630
Oh,I just--
I--

414
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:16,280
mother,mother,mother,
we'll discuss it later.

415
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,220
They have
a great crab salad here.


416
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,650
don't take me!

417
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,090
Don't come near me!

418
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,030
You understand?

419
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,880
Because they're gonna shoot
my daughter in there

420
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,600
if you come near me
in any way!

421
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,720
Okay?

422
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,440
- Oh,dad!
- Trojans beat oregon!

423
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,550
I can smell the roses.
Come on,let's go to the homecoming rally.

424
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,360
No,I gotta finish
this book.

425
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,620
You know,you used to beg me to take you
to those things when I'd take your brothers.

426
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,220
You'd even do the trojan cheer
for me.

427
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,100
Yeah,I was like 10.

428
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,340
Honey,you have had your nose
in this thing all day.

429
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,070
It's time for you to take
a break with your old man.

430
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,600
If you're nice to me,I'll give
you a sip of my beer.

431
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,770
What about mom?

432
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,360
I forwarded all the calls
to my cell phone.

433
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,150
Get your shoes on.
Let's go,come on!

434
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,680
it's not like I'm asking for
a penthouse,a house in bel-air.

435
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,020
For 2 grand a month,
a person should be entitled some light,some space.

436
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,410
The one in century city
wasn't bad.

437
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,850
It was century city adjacent
at best.

438
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,830
How about the one in north hollywood?
That had plenty of light.

439
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,950
Right on the 134?
All the noise,the pollution?

440
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,640
Egan,it's not like
you're gonna retire there.

441
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,140
No,but I might want
to entertain occasionally.

442
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,400
You know,maybe get
a regular poker game going,huh?

443
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,250
You'd better hurry.
There's a car coming at 6:00.

444
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,080
You know,I just want to know
why my mother casually let it drop

445
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,910
that we were celebrating
my engagement.

446
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,110
Well,that must have been
awkward given the circumstances.

447
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,610
I mean,what did you do,ask for my hand in
marriage when you know how I feel about my mother?

448
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,340
I mean,what is this,the '50s?
Were the two of you working out my dowry?

449
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,540
Right,your mother--
that's the issue here.

450
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,880
No,ed,the issue is that
it's more important to you

451
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,350
that everybody thinks you're swell than it is
to show me fundamental respect and consideration.

452
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,240
"Respect and consideration"?

453
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,790
You know,
it makes me wonder.

454
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,380
I mean,do you have any idea
who I am or what it is that i want?

455
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,640
You don't know what you want,

456
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,950
which is why you came over here
to pick a fight with me,

457
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,420
so you don't have to deal
with yourself.

458
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,090
- Don't put this on me.
- No,this one's all you.

459
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,220
Now,I love you,kat.
You know I do.

460
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,460
But I put myself out there,
and you literally ran away.

461
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,820
Now putting my feelings aside--
which,by the way,

462
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,250
is kind of a pattern here--
putting my feelings aside,

463
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,660
you need to get clear
on what you're doing,

464
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,260
because if we're not
moving forward,

465
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,870
I don't know
where we're going anymore.

466
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,910
You can let yourself out.

467
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,270
Do you usually goto the bathroom this much?

468
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,510
I'm nervous.

469
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,310
Yeah,well,I can't keep walking you back here.
This is the last time.

470
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,660
I'm pregnant.

471
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,610
That's why.

472
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,290
- Don't let randall find out.
- I won'T.

473
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,500
I mean it. It won't be good
if he finds out.

474
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,140
- Why?
- Just trust me.

475
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,920
And nobody else
should find out either.

476
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,380
And tell your boyfriend
not to say anything.

477
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,510
He won'T.

478
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,610
He doesn't know yet.

479
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,110
What's your name?

480
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,880
Lucas.

481
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,000
Thank you,lucas.

482
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,200
Oh,sorry.

483
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,950
Oh,it's okay.
Uh,I was just headed out.

484
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,280
Cologne?

485
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,760
Yeah,I gotta go
to this charity thing.

486
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,870
You have a date?

487
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,490
I thought it was a little
too soon for full disclosure.

488
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,060
No,it is... too soon.

489
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,240
Well,I'm running late.
I should go.

490
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,810
Have a good time.

491
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,860
You got an open seat?

492
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,800
You're the first one here.

493
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,420
Where is everyone?

494
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,370
Egan's out getting ice
or,uh,guacamole.

495
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,590
Can I get you something?

496
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,560
Uh,yeah,I'll take
one of those bad boys. Thanks.

497
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,790
I thought you had
a thing with ed.

498
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,660
Yeah,last-minute change
of plans.

499
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,750
- Lucky for us.
- Thanks.

500
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,410
You see something
you want to put on?

501
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,850
Uh,you pick.

502
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,320
I didn't know
you had a sister.

503
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,750
That's my ex-wife.

504
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,180
she's really pretty.

505
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,380
It's a good picture
of my mom.

506
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,670
Ed...
ed proposed to me.

507
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,330
Was that the,uh,
second half of your mom's toast?

508
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,710
Yeah,apparently.

509
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,050
Good for you.

510
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,220
well,I haven't
answered him yet.

511
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,450
Really?

512
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,930
But he's a good guy.

513
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,750
Well,I'm kind of
a commitment-phobe.

514
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,130
Aren't we all?

515
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,230
kathryn hale! Hey!

516
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,010
- Hey!
- Hi.

517
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,410
My evening is complete.

518
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,260
- Hey,and look who I found outside.
- Hey,there.

519
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,770
Hey,you made it
with the whole family.

520
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,880
Yep,well,I figure
she's off to college soon.

521
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,650
She might as well
learn how to play cards,right?

522
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,460
Well,here's to her education.

523
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,730
And gene's coming,too.
We're gonna have a full house.

524
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,360
Egan,I cannot get enough
of this guacamole. What is in this?

525
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,800
Some call it cilantro.
I call it fiesta.

526
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,820
Call.

527
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,830
2 pair. Kings and 7s.

528
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,370
- Trip 6s.
- Hello!

529
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,040
is this good?

530
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,700
let me see.
Yogot four,no,five jacks with a wild card.

531
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,270
Honey,that means you won.
You're a natural-born genius.

532
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,490
All right,here we go.

533
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,570
- Get your money,babe.
- Sweet innocence.

534
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,980
it's your mother.

535
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,100
Sit out the next hand.

536
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,390
Um,hey,honey.

537
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,060
- Come on,egan.
- It's your deal.

538
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,350
Um,we're just,uh,
taking it easy,you know?

539
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,490
Ing to the wife about poker.
very old-scol.

540
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,930
No,it's not lying.
It's bluffing.

541
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,090
hey,she's learning.

542
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,840
- very nice.
- Okay,uh,7-card stud.

543
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,850
Ante up. And deuces,
one-eyed jacks wild.

544
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,350
Oh,come on.
Playing with two wild cards is not poker.

545
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,510
Who's up for a round of hold'em?
$5,$10 blinds.

546
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,580
Cavanaugh's getting restless.

547
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,800
All right.

548
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,240
I'm sorry I was out of line
with you before.

549
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,650
I'm just... scared

550
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,980
about everything
I have to face.

551
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,560
I know.

552
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,950
I guess you are,too.

553
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,260
I don't know
what I am lately.

554
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,270
It all got turned
upside down,didn't it?

555
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,980
Yeah.

556
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,910
Can I get you anything?
It is your last night.

557
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,170
You could sit with me.

558
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:39,520
these arms of mine

559
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,430
they are lonely

560
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,930
lonely and feeling blue

561
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,420
I am really sorry for
dragging you to that thing.

562
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,780
Those people...

563
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,350
somehow I don't think
they were all there for animal rescue,huh?

564
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,130
you think?

565
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,910
Did you see that one lady
in the leather pantsuit?

566
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:06,520
A mujer con un trajeI mean,come on.
How many cows do you think
were killed to make that thing?

567
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,130
oh,wait.

568
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,410
What? What?

569
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,650
You said "pantsuit."

570
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,410
Who says "pantsuit"?

571
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,950
Shut up.

572
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,150
Pantsuit.
My mother used to wear those.

573
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,750
You are such a white boy.

574
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,410
Do that dance move
for me again.

575
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,050
What,do you mean this one?

576
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,090
oh,no.
they are burning

577
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,830
I had a really good time
tonight.

578
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,360
Burning from wanting you

579
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,240
me,too.

580
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,370
These arms of mine

581
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,890
this is the most...

582
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,040
uncomplicated I've felt
in a long time.

583
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,770
...Wanting to hold you

584
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,730
and if you

585
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,450
would let them

586
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,660
are we really doing this?

587
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,540
Oh,how grateful
I will be

588
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,710
come on

589
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,070
come on,baby

590
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,510
just be my little woman

591
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,950
just be me lover

592
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,790
- nick's got cards.
- Scared?

593
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,220
not yet.
Call.

594
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,570
Calling and flopping.

595
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,180
two ladies showing.

596
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,150
check.

597
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,960
what?
Do you think they changed on you?

598
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,970
10.

599
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,670
I'm jumping off
this train,boys.

600
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,720
You can't handle it.

601
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,970
10 and raise 10.

602
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,620
Check,raise. Very sly.

603
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,520
Too hot for me.
I'm getting out of the kitchen.

604
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,010
What do you have,my friend?

605
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:59,900
Well,there is one more queen
besides the one in your hand,

606
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,510
and I think I have
the better kicker.

607
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,770
Your thoughts,milady?

608
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,510
You can hang.

609
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,950
here goes nothing.

610
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,100
Fourth street.

611
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,400
10.

612
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,150
- I think you're bluffing.
- Then raise me.

613
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,980
- I will.
- Reraise.

614
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,560
Raise you back.

615
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,380
this is a rush.

616
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,950
What do you say
we go no limit?

617
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,390
Bring it on,my friend.

618
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,120
Guys,come on.
What are you doing?

619
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,800
We're playing cards.

620
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,570
$240. I'm all in.

621
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,870
all right.

622
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:40,540
I got $180
on the table.

623
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,260
-,do you accept cash?
- Why not?

624
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,920
All right,let's see...

625
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,000
$20,$40 and $60.

626
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,710
Okay.

627
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,330
This is ridiculous.

628
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,770
Okay,alpha dogs.
Let's see 'em.

629
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,180
Three sisters.

630
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,300
I hit my straight.
Sorry,bud.

631
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,310
Burned by lady luck.

632
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,290
I should have known.
I'm playing with a shark.

633
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,830
Wait a minute,you were...

634
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,640
you were betting
on a straight draw?

635
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,650
I got my lucky 7.

636
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,530
Yeah,but that was
the last card.

637
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,470
I mean,you should have
dropped out after the flop.

638
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,520
You had nothing,
and you kept on raising?

639
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,300
I was bluffing.

640
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,140
Yeah,but you knew
had three queens.

641
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,810
I won the hand,didn't I?
Is there a problem?

642
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:39,540
No,no,no. It'S...
it's fine. Whatever.

643
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:46,100
Uh,anyone up for
some more,uh,guacamole?

644
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,310
There was this card game
last night at nick's,

645
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:03,640
and there was this moment
where he won this really big hand,

646
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,860
and there was just something
about it that made me snap.

647
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,840
How do you mean?

648
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,280
I don't know. I T...
I got really angry.

649
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,580
I don't know why.

650
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,780
He could have lost everything,

651
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,250
and then he just happened
to get the right card.

652
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,820
And maybe that's
great card-playing,but it's just...

653
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,850
it's like this guy is
willing to bet everything

654
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,730
on a wing a prayer and just
kind of hope it works out?

655
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,990
I mean,this is crazy!
What was I even doing there?

656
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,450
What do you think
you were doing there?

657
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,990
I don't know.

658
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,390
I'm wondering why
this is suddenly so urgent for you.

659
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,430
Well,because ed is...

660
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,700
well,he's kind of
thrown down the gauntlet.

661
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,240
I-I think I've,uh...

662
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,140
I've finally pushed him
to his limit.

663
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,330
So... this may be
a fork in the road?

664
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,050
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

665
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,770
Why am I resisting someone
that I have loved for four years,

666
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,240
who has been there for me
again and again?

667
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:03,200
Well,you and nick went through something
incredibly powerful together.

668
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,620
It's not easily dismissed.

669
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,350
Yeah.

670
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,820
I used-- I used to take these walks
on the beach when I was kid,

671
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,560
and I would...

672
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,380
I would pick up
the brightest shells,

673
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:24,490
the ones with the strongest
greens and purples and reds.

674
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,960
And then when I got home,
I'd put them on the windowsill,

675
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,200
and they just--
I don't know.

676
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,750
They seemed pale
and dusty,

677
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,140
you know,
like they couldn'T...

678
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:38,040
they couldn't survive
outside the saltwater.

679
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,360
Is that how you feel
about nick?

680
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,290
That he can't survive
out in the world?

681
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,820
That what
we had inside the bank

682
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:54,090
won't survive outside
in the world.

683
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,810
hey! Do not move.

684
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,340
Cuff the post first.

685
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,220
That's fine. Now me.

686
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,320
That's fine.
Not so tight.

687
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,660
I'm sorry.

688
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,940
thanks for speaking up before
about keeping me in.

689
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,890
It helped.

690
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,400
you--move!

691
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,390
I think we all feel better
having you here.

692
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,970
all right,come on.

693
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,880
Morning.

694
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,000
Hey,uh,sorry.

695
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,200
I was hoping to finish
by the time you got up.

696
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,100
No sweat.
It's been worse.

697
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,200
There's coffee.

698
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,010
Are you,uh,

699
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,680
actually going to apply
to this hellhole?

700
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,620
Oh,I wouldn't call it
a hellhole.

701
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,130
More like a mousehole.

702
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,450
Look,this is ridiculous.
Take back the money.

703
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,810
- I'm not taking the money.
- I don't want it.

704
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:05,410
- You won it fair and square!
- I was an ass last night,okay?

705
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,960
- I pushed you into it.
- I wasn't pushed.

706
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,330
I was playing poker. It was actually
surprisingly thrilling,worth every penny,

707
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,150
and if you keep trying to give me back the money,
then i am gonna feel like the ass.

708
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,830
Oh,nick,come on.

709
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,430
You just paid
your first month's rent.

710
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:35,270
Keep looking for a place,
but in the meantime,

711
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,680
stick around...

712
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,490
if you don't mind the couch.

713
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,330
Okay.
Thank you.

714
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,800
you know,

715
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:02,010
you're the only one
who knows...

716
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,380
what happened
between me and jeremy.

717
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,790
You haven't talked
to anybody about it?

718
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:11,180
I haven't even talked
to him about it.

719
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,390
There's really nothing
between us now but silence.

720
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,220
And a child.

721
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,770
What happens when someone's
pointing a gun at you is not who you are.

722
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,620
I can tell you that.

723
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,410
don't let
your mind get weary

724
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,330
and confused

725
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:36,130
your will be still

726
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,360
don't try

727
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,590
don't let your heart

728
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,990
get heavy,child

729
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,230
inside you

730
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:55,260
there's a strength
that lies

731
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,690
ed?

732
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,980
Don't let your soul

733
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,300
get lonely,child

734
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,190
it's only time

735
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:08,110
it will go by

736
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,870
don't look for love

737
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,430
in faces
places

738
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,830
it's in you

739
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:21,000
that's where you'll find

740
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,950
- hey.
- Hey.

741
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,750
I let myself in.

742
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,260
How was the mayor?

743
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,880
Mayoral.

744
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,220
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

745
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,330
I'm sorry I've been
such an idiot.

746
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:49,490
I guess you've been reconsidering the part
about not wanting to lose me twice.

747
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,090
well,maybe I never had you.

748
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,550
Eddie,I been thinking
about it a lot,

749
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:02,280
and I-I know I have been
all over the place,

750
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,070
but for what it's worth,

751
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,690
I feel clear now,

752
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:11,660
and... I know that you probably feel
that you can't trust that,

753
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,490
but...

754
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:18,260
I want you to try.

755
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,880
What does that mean,"try"?

756
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,970
Will you do me the honor of finishing
what you were asking me the other night?

757
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,580
Please.

758
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,140
I wasn't planning on
doing this in my underwear.

759
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,120
Kathryn hale...

760
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,240
will you marry me?

761
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,010
Oh,my god.

762
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,680
That ring,that'S...

763
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,360
that's my grandmother's ring.
Where did you get that?

764
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,790
Ah,your mother,
god bless her,

765
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:21,180
said to me very early on that if I ever wanted
to take things to the next level,

766
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,570
she had the ring.

767
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,670
So last week,I called her
and said I was ready.

768
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,650
It looks good.

769
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,270
Ooh. What's that for?

770
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,570
it's good
to have you home.

771
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,220
Oh,I should go away
more often.

772
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:53,380
What'd you and felicia do?
That girl is positively sparkling.

773
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,520
Well,nothing special.
Just a good time with her dad.

774
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,240
Not too many left before
she's off to college.

775
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,560
So you,uh,ever hear back
from the alarm company?

776
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,780
Oh,yeah,they came by. Said it was a broken
window sensor or something.

777
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,080
- So they fixed it?
- Supposedly.

778
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,250
'Cause I don't want ms. Fisher
to start complaining.

779
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,290


780
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,740


781
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,590


782
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,130


783
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,620
