00:00:01,944 --> 00:00:04,756
Fed tailed me to the diner last night,
I spotted them after left.

3
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:05,380
The feds?

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,860
Your bigger forces are
at work here with me.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,571
Mr. Mayor.

6
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:11,158
I've decided to offer you my
endorsement for the District Attorney

7
00:00:11,158 --> 00:00:13,359
But Ed has been
expecting this.

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,720
I've been in a line for this

9
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,567
He told me you were out.

10
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:17,017
Of course that's
what he told you.

11
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,540
So, are we done?

12
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,575
I need some time to think.

13
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,719
Two years and we just flush down
a drain with barely on conversation.

14
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:23,912
Why do you keep
on coming here?

15
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:25,279
You've become important to me.

16
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,869
How far were you from Tom
when Randall shot him?

17
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:31,533

You know you used to be.

23
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,963

I'm worried about Jeremy.

25
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,384
He won't talk to me.

26
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:12,114
He's gotta be in shock.

27
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,767

31
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:30,305
You think they
can see us in here?

00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:40,022
I can't make heads

33
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:41,941
I gotta take a leak.

34
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:01,170
You ok?

35
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,245
Oh, yeah.

36
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:03,185
Peachy.

37
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:04,645
Military are in.

38
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:07,043
Army, marines.

39
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,305
What makes you think that?

40
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:10,419
See the way we hold the gun,
the way we handle these stuff?

41
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,134
Yes, I'm military.
What's your point?

42
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:14,632
My point is your war fed.
Your partner is ex-con.

43
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:17,051
It's gonna matter to trial.
It's gonna matter a lot.

44
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:20,715
What's gonna matter even more is
you didn't kill the security guard. He did.

45
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:22,849
What makes you think
this isn't going to trial?

46
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:25,100
Look, I know you feel some
kind of loyalty to the guy,

47
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,884
but if we end this now, you got 90
blue, they are gonna testify for you.

48
00:02:28,884 --> 00:02:29,812
and against him.

49
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:30,899
Oh, yeah.

50
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:32,942
We all know that you wanted
to get the security guard out.

51
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:34,072
You didn't wanted
to go this way.

52
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:36,633
We find a way
to end this, now.

53
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:40,742
You're gonna be
much better off.

54
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:46,465
You, forget about it.

55
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:47,839
I'm not sending him out.

56
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:49,481
Now, get back down
before I cuff you again.

clean out the little girl's room.

58
00:02:54,152 --> 00:02:55,912

blood in there.

59
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:57,445
Hey, forget about that.

60
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:59,036
Take a look at this.

61
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:05,736
Look.

62
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:06,475
Hey.

63
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:08,923
Why don't come
and sit over here.

64
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,241
I just got out of a situation.

65
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:14,920
but I, I kind of like
it if you stay with me there.

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,401
But I don't feel like sitting.

67
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:18,378
You can stand here, if you want.

68
00:03:28,478 --> 00:03:32,010
Take Peter Pan, his own
girlfriend, make a bloody hell.

69
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,035
Go on.

71
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,761

72
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:38,132

80
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:31,143
- Nothing.
- Really?

81
00:04:31,143 --> 00:04:32,590
- Why would I?
- Maybe, it was a payoff

82
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,563
- For what?
- Someone who's supposed to help you that day.

83
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:35,756
- You're out of your mind.
- Am I?

84
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:37,505
Yeah.

85
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:42,309

in the eye and answer me this.

92

No, I haven't heard from Li yet.
Nobody has.

She missed two shifts at work.

121
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,273
and I tried calling her friends,

122
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:50,856
even tried calling her parents
who she barely speaks to.

123
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:53,756
Called Kathryn, Malcolm, Franny.
Nobody heard from her.

124
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:57,074

and we decided better come over here.

125
00:06:57,074 --> 00:06:58,655
Is she ever disappeared

126
00:06:58,655 --> 00:06:58,896
No.

127
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:01,231
Three days ago. How was the day
we were all at the D.A.'s office?

128
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:02,658
Yeah.

129
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:04,282
Something happened there.

130
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:05,239
What?

131
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,603
She found out Franny and
I've been seeing each other.

132
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:14,536
Which is why I wasn't worried at first because
I figured she just needed a day or two to herself,

133
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,164
but now three day,
and now there's no..

134
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:18,254
You do remember that
Lizzie is pregnant,

135
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:19,575
and Franny just lost her sister.

136
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:21,458
You wanna pass judgment,
Let's do with that later.

137
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:24,623
Right now, we all just
wanna find Lizzie, right?

138
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,241

139
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:37,587
Yeah.

140
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,073
All right, sounds good.

141
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:40,095
I'll see you then.

142
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:42,605

143
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:43,485
Hey.

144
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:45,753
So we have been in our
separate corners for three days,

145
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:48,016

if you can come out.

00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:51,660
Your life long amibition goes down the
tube, she needs a few days to cool off.

147
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:54,657
I put in a call to the mayor,

148
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:58,306
and when he calls me back, I'm telling
him I'm not accepting his endorsement.

149
00:07:58,508 --> 00:07:59,883
It's not worth it,

150
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:01,371
hurting you,

151
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:02,985
hurting our relationship, our future.

152
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:05,124
- It's just not worth it, I'm not taking it.
- Yes, you are.

153
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:08,498
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are, and I'll tell you why.

154
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:10,160
They ran the polls, Kath.

155
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,548
You're scoring 200points better
than me across the county.

156
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:15,166
200 points better than any
candidate that they can put up.

157
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:17,715
This is real.

158
00:08:17,715 --> 00:08:18,635
I can't stand in your way.

159
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:21,206
You can't be this novel,
and I can't take it.

160
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:22,386
I'm not being novel.

161
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:24,165
It's gonna be ugly,

162
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:25,793
gonna be ugly and hard.

163
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:28,949
But if you pass on this, it will be
part of you, you'll never forgive me.

164
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:31,043
No, that is not true.

165
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:34,037
Well, and part of me will
never be able to forgive myself.

166
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:35,456
for standing in your way.

167
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:37,725
Now one way or the
other bolt on us.

turning out like this.

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,324
Maybe it's not my path.

178
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:06,301
Maybe it's yours.

179
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,323
You notice anything in here
seemed out of the ordinary?

180
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:14,359
Well, the cable TV.

181
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:16,263
How's that?

182
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:19,000
She didn't have it before.
She reads.

183
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:21,131
Seen any clothes around?

184
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:22,594
anything look like she packed.

185
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:23,279
No.

186
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,898
Anything missing, any
overnight bags, suitcases.

187
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,410
I've checked, everything
I remembered still here.

188
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,969
What do you make
out of the note?

189
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:32,624
I love you.

190
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:38,000
You want us to
have a mock robbery?

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,744
It's called security training.

192
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:41,069
I don't care what it's called.

193
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:43,729
You're gonna be bringing actors in here,
waving guns around?

194
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:46,820
A month after two employees
got killed in this place, Mary.

195
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,759
- It's cool.
- I agree.

196
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,076
I'm afraid you left us no choice when you
made bank security matter of navigation.

197
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,739
So this is payback for
the Tom Mitchell's lawsuit.

198
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:57,613
It is not payback, Malcolm.

199
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:00,910
And what about my quarterly bonus?
what's going on with that?

200
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,380
it's still under review.

201
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,481
and my application
for original manager.

202
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:06,719
You can't be serious, Malcolm.

203
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,944
So you're just gonna cheap away of me bit by bit
until I can't take it anymore? Is that the game here?

204
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:15,114
Tom Mitchell died, protecting
this bank and its employees.

205
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,937
Now, that is not entirely clear.

206
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:21,707
but what is clear is that you feel more
loyal to this wife than you do to the company,

207
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:25,260
so why would you expect the
company's loyalty and return, Malcolm.

208
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,307
Hey, Coop.

209
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:31,565
This is Jeremy Kates
and Egan Foot.

210
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:34,437
They're here to file a missing person,
Elizabeth Miller. She's a friend.

211
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:35,826
So whatever they need.

212
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:36,738
- Of course.
- And a..

213
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:40,190
Have Ferguson start the paperwork on the warrent
for Miss Miller's cell phone and credit card record.

214
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,091
Katherine Hale in DA's
office will expedite.

215
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,223
She's expecting the call.

216
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:45,768
I'll be back to you
guys, just one minute.

217
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:48,244
- Vartak.
- Hey.

218
00:10:48,244 --> 00:10:49,811
You've been tailing
Lizzie Miller?

219
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:53,339
You told me to back off last month then.
I haven't been even thought about it since.

220
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:54,739
- Why? What's going on?
- She's missing.

221
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:56,389
Three days.
I think she's on surveillance.

222
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,931
Whoever is surveilling her
knows where she is, right?

223
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:00,035
unless she tripped to took off.

224
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,569
Why take off and
not come to you.

225
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:03,968
I mean you pretty
tie up with it, right?

226
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:06,539
In a way, but I can't
say how she ticks.

227
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,221
All right, I'll check Highway
patrols hospitals for any Jane Does.

228
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:12,962
And uh.. would you run that
for fingerprints on a QT.

229
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:14,388
Somebody was
trying to spook her.

230
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:16,759
or to warn her.

231
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,942
She moved to LA when?

232
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:19,851
4 years ago.

233
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:23,205
She was in graduate school.
She transferred here USLA for second year.

234
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:25,459
How long she worked at
mercy fields hospital?

235
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:26,822
3 years since she
finished graduate school.

236
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:27,769
And you've been seeing
each other how long?

237
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:28,635
2 years

238
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:29,600
over 2 years.

239
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,407
Does she've been married?

240
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:31,167
No.

241
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:32,150
Engaged?

242
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,527
Any kids?

243
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:37,845
She's pregnant.

244
00:11:37,845 --> 00:11:39,587
She's..

245
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:40,813
about 3 months.

246
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:42,179
So she isn't showing yet.

247
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,425
Not yet, no.

248
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:46,086
You are the father?

249
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:49,568
and she answered no?

250
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:57,754
I gotta ask.

251
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:02,845
I'm the father.

252
00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:11,666
We gotta get the damn
cable guys out here already.

253
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,637
As soon as you
can get away, yeah.

254
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:20,079
No, not here.
It can't be here.

255
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,348
You come alone, right?

256
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:23,706
All right, I'll see you then.

257
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,158
Woo.

258
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:25,992
Sounds mysterious.

259
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:26,611
What's up?

260
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:30,271
Well, you know how Jeremy said
that Lizzie just got cable TV?

261
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:31,925
- even though she was never
much of a TV watcher. - Yeah

262
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,796
Well, I was at home last week.

263
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:34,563
You are home.

264
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:38,224
And the cable guy comes around, says
he offering 2 months free service

265
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,230
I don't know,
we already have cable TV.

266
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,073
He says he'll give us
all the premium channel.

267
00:12:42,073 --> 00:12:44,636
So I got an executive decision.

268
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:45,803
And uh, told him ok.

269
00:12:45,803 --> 00:12:47,622
The thing is, this
guy was very pushy.

270
00:12:47,622 --> 00:12:50,063
I didn't through much trouble
at the time, I just checked it out.

271
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:54,486
Silver leg, woodland hills, different
cable providers, but it was the same company

272
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:55,890
in our house, and the Lizzie's.

273
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,168
I saw the pamphlet on
the table at her place.

274
00:12:58,168 --> 00:12:59,788
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just being crazy?

275
00:13:02,153 --> 00:13:02,770
What is it mean?

276
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:08,441
It means she's not the
only one being watched.

277
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:23,593
<i>BANK

278
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,112
You two, let's go!
toward the back.

279
00:13:43,104 --> 00:13:43,720
Hey.

280
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:47,323
So you want to tell us
what we are doing here?

281
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:49,526
He didn't want me to say
anything until he gets in here.

282
00:13:49,526 --> 00:13:50,592
Do you have any
word on Lizzie?

283
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:52,130
No, not yet.

284
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,204
Well, where is Nick?

285
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:58,386
Ho, ho, ho,
what have we here?

286
00:13:58,386 --> 00:14:00,738
Why don't you head inside,
I'll be there on a minute.

287
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:02,202
You sure you don't
need any backup?

288
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:03,079
I'm sure.

289
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:03,890
Thanks.

290
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:09,018
How's going fellas.

291
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:10,909
Hi. uh. what can we
do for you officer.

292
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:13,165
I'm just wondering what business
you might have here today.

293
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:16,973
Ah... just some installation,
on the a 24 there.

294
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:19,038
What are you doing sit in
the car, not installing.

295
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:22,370
uh.. we were just getting our
paperwork together. We just got here.

296
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:23,740
Great.

297
00:14:24,473 --> 00:14:26,342
mind if I take a
look at the back?

298
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:27,296
Why?

299
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:29,130
What's your problem?

300
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,377
You got a warrant?
or probable cause?

301
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:35,663
You're a lawyer?
or cable guy?

302
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:38,265
Go ahead, take a look.

303
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:38,924
It's unlocked.

304
00:14:57,031 --> 00:14:59,050
Nick, what's with
all this suspense.

305
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,010
I found a note, Lizzie's.

306
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,775
which said you
are being watched.

307
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:03,359
Oh my god.

308
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:04,515
I don't think Lizzie saw that.

309
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:06,637
Maybe it was just lucky for us.
We went over there, found it.

310
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:08,098
That's why I asked
you all to come here.

311
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:10,897
It's very likely that some
of us being surveillant.

312
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:14,461
Possibly, bugged in our homes,
maybe our offices, maybe our cars.

313
00:15:14,461 --> 00:15:15,729
What?

314
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:19,123
Did any of you had any surprise visits
from cable company in a last couple weeks?

315
00:15:19,123 --> 00:15:22,067
Yeah, they came around last
week offering me free movie channels.

316
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:22,742
No, I haven't

317
00:15:22,742 --> 00:15:23,710
What about pass control?

318
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,682
gas company, any service
people showing up unexpectedly?

319
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:29,807
Actually, there was a plumber that came by,
but he claimed it was for the whole building.

320
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:31,431
We just had a security
system installed.

321
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,203
Could they do with that?

322
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:33,094
It's possible.

323
00:15:33,094 --> 00:15:34,929
Did you order it? or did
they solicit you for it?

324
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:36,308
He... he ordered it.

325
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:38,798
No, wait a minute.
no, they called.

326
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:40,378
Naomi insisted to put it in.

327
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:41,149
So it's all of us.

328
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,366
I don't get why do we have to
do this here, out of all places

329
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:45,078
'cause there is no way they
can surveillance here.

330
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,986
Is this because of Felicia?
because she went to see Lucas?

331
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:49,305
Lizzie went to see Lucas, too.

332
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:50,947
Ok, so who was it?
the police?

333
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:51,949
I am not sure.

334
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,646
What if it's the bank.

335
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:55,427
Why would the bank do this?

336
00:15:55,427 --> 00:15:58,037
Tom's widow is suing
the bank for 20 million.

337
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:02,232
The bank knows I blinded alongside her.
if she wins, who's to say we couldn't all sue?

338
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:04,148
I mean that at least a
hundred million in stack.

339
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:05,098
It could be.

340
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:10,386
They hired Pellicano typed, poking to our business, that
way if we do sue, they got something to fight back with.

341
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,868
Maybe it was one of Lucas and
Randall's buddies or something.

342
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,948
High tech stuff
for those guys.

343
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:19,958
Lucas is in marine, and he did
cut the video vid at the bank.

344
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:25,132
So what do we suppose to do now
with these things in our homes.

345
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:27,876
I know some deep bugging test.
They'll sweep our places for us

346
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:30,657
Excuse me.
I gotta go.

347
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:35,886
Jeremy said that he'd been
falling out with Lizzie.

348
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:37,161
Does anyone know
what that's about?

349
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,015
It was me.

350
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:44,953
She found out that Jeremy and
I've been seeing each other.

351
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:57,434
What are we doing down here?

352
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,194
I didn't know there was
emergency exit by the vault.

353
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:01,313
I need you for cover.

354
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:09,381
What was that?

355
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:00,051
I had to tell them.

356
00:18:00,943 --> 00:18:01,863
You all right?

357
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:04,631
I just want to find her.

358
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:07,583
Why didn't you tell the group
that FBI followed you last night?

359
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:11,580
They were tailing for different reasons, plus I have no
proof that it was happening this time, not yet anyway.

360
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,656
Do you think Lizzie being
gone is related to this?

361
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:15,481
I think this is the way they
are getting Lizzie Miller.

362
00:18:17,301 --> 00:18:22,817
I am telling you, you would send someone to my house this
afternoon, and take that alarm system out, Do you hear me?

363
00:18:22,817 --> 00:18:25,816
No, not tomorrow, today!

364
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,065
<i>Hey, it's Lizzie.

365
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,951
<i>If you can't find me at the hospital,
you can leave a message here.

366
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:32,582
<i>Have a great day. Bye.

367
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,062
Hey.

368
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:42,954
Well, I was hoping that maybe
she might have called you.

369
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:44,298
Yeah, I'm a friend of hers.

370
00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:46,126
I'm really sorry
to you bothered you

371
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,346
Ok, well, if you hear from her,
would you have a call Jeremy?

372
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:50,335
Ok, thanks.

373
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:52,449
That's her boyfriend.

374
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,686
All right.

375
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:55,551
Thank you. Good bye.

376
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:58,385
Ok, come on. We were
just through the R's.

377
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:02,530
Have you noticed anything
calling all these people?

378
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,340
What's that?

379
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,042
Well, other than the friends
she's made in here in LA.

380
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,060
She hasn't talked
to anyone in years.

381
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,510
I never realize, but high school,
college, graduate school.

382
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,753
She's got numbers for all these people,
but she's not in touch with anybody.

383
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:17,165
It's like as soon
as she moves on,

384
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:18,909
she's makin' it clean break.

385
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,852
She didn't just
pick up and leave.

386
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:23,082
That's impossible.

387
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:25,141
How do you know.

388
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,096
You got somethin'?

389
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:29,279
Lizzie's credit card records.

390
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,177
No charges at all on the last 3 days, no
intent through all transactions, or any contact.

391
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:35,633
What about her cell phone?
Did you get anything on that?

392
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,488
Nothing.

393
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:38,498
No out going call
since she disappeared.

394
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:51,845
Lizzie, hey, it's Kathryn.

395
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:55,339
Listen, I know about what
happened between you and Jeremy,

396
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:58,082
and Franny, and I know
that you're upset, but..

397
00:19:58,082 --> 00:19:59,986
if you just could call me back,

398
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:04,705
there is a lot going on here and
everyone is really worried about you.

399
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:07,698
So just call one of us, and
let us know that you're ok.

400
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:09,142
Alright, bye.

401
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:10,248
So?

402
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:12,269
One in the phone, one
in the cabinet, so far.

403
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:12,975
Great.

404
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:15,760
Rachel, where is
that Miller warrant?

405
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,153
Here, just came in.

406
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:20,226
Well, get it to detective
Cavanaugh right away.

407
00:20:20,226 --> 00:20:21,389
Where are you going?

408
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:23,703
There's something I have to do. If
any one ask, tell them I'm in court.

409
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,173
Thanks for coming, John.

410
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:34,691
Sure, Nick.
Sound pretty urgent.

411
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,916
What do you about that?

412
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:38,618
Looks like m24.

413
00:20:38,618 --> 00:20:39,997
Is that pretty standard
issue for the bureau?

414
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:41,096
I'm not the only
one who use it.

415
00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:41,749
but yeah, sure.

416
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:45,065
Any idea why are these showing up in the
homes and offices of my friends in the bank.

417
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:46,620
You know I can't
talk about that.

418
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,766
Really, John.
I should recall several..

419
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:53,216
occasion, several ethically challenged
situations where I went way out on a limb for you.

420
00:20:56,636 --> 00:20:58,428
But anything I tell you,
you didn't hear from me, ok?

421
00:20:58,428 --> 00:20:59,428
Scott's honor.

422
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:05,572
Everybody's on town went after Felicia
Jones went to see Lucas Dalton in county.

423
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:08,326
but I thought that smoke had cleared,
it was Stockholm, nothing more.

424
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:09,814
but the stink from that didn't stick to her father

425
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:12,548
Of course the first thing we did was
to get to the people inside the bank.

426
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:15,654
But there was a lot more tension paid to the
tellers, employees didn't show up that day.

427
00:21:15,654 --> 00:21:16,942
How about the Rios girls.

428
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,921
We know about Eva's criminal record and
Franny's petty drug stuff, but as far as I know,

429
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:22,519
they both on the clear.

430
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:25,711
So as far as FBI's concerning
it was Dalton reasonin', that's it.

431
00:21:25,746 --> 00:21:26,600
That's it.

432
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,021
Any chance you would know about this?

433
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:30,842
What, surveillance?
this extensive?

434
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:32,472
I hope I could know about it.

435
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:36,784
<i>Social Services

436
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:47,050
What are you doing?

437
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,723
I don't know.

438
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:51,401
You think the answer to where she
is might be in her patient box?

439
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:53,106
I said I don't know, Egan.

440
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:03,189
You know, I realized earlier
when we were in Lizzie's house

441
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:07,898
that in all the time that we were together,
I stepped foot in that place maybe six times.

442
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:10,109
We always hang out my place.

443
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:12,223
She was somehow
okay with that.

444
00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:16,931
She was understanding of
the pressures of my job and..

445
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:20,121
she never asked for much
which made things easy for me,

446
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:22,633
and let things be easy.

447
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:27,386
And now..
I'm sitting here, and

448
00:22:27,386 --> 00:22:32,378
I mean do I even know this
woman who I spent two years with?

449
00:22:32,378 --> 00:22:34,785
whom going out of a child with?

450
00:22:34,785 --> 00:22:37,047
I spent 18 years
with the same woman.

451
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:43,328
There were days when I knew
her like the back of my hand.

452
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:51,749
and there were days when I felt like,
woke up sleeping next to a stranger.

453
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,625
I never would know
anybody, not completely.

454
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:20,577
Sit down, dog. Move!

455
00:23:30,623 --> 00:23:32,106
Are you alright?

456
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:34,498
What? yeah.

457
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,637
Did something happen in there?

458
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:38,968
Did he do something to you?

459
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:40,462
What?

460
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:41,862
Who?

461
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:44,630
No.

462
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,049
It's..

463
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,969
It wasn't him.

464
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:09,255
So what is the sign? not used to seeing you
outside the annual stand for booze and schmooze.

465
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:11,637
Uh.. I thought maybe
we would catch up.

466
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:16,425
Come on, either you dump Nielson or getting
me drunk so that you can make your move.

467
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:18,576
Not necessary by the way.

468
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:19,753
or you need a favor.

469
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:22,918
Bastard.

470
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,514
It's not a favor.. exactly.

471
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:29,380
You want to marry Ed, but
set me up in an apartment.

472
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,312
Well, I'll not be cab, Kathryn.

473
00:24:37,738 --> 00:24:39,288
The Fidelity Bank law suit.

474
00:24:39,288 --> 00:24:40,956
Not my case, you
know that, right?

475
00:24:40,956 --> 00:24:43,993
I swore off from the word go,
even I had my limits.

476
00:24:43,993 --> 00:24:46,810
I do know that
about you, Dickie.

477
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,757
and I also know that
if you knew anything,

478
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:52,337
any reason why they
might be surveilling us.

479
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:53,140
Surveilling?

480
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,803
Me and the other hostages.

481
00:24:54,803 --> 00:24:57,502
They are bugging our houses,
our phones, my office.

482
00:24:57,502 --> 00:24:58,723
What? who do that?

483
00:24:58,723 --> 00:24:59,923
FBI

484
00:24:59,923 --> 00:25:04,856
hired by your law firm to kill the Judith
Michel law suit or any other law suit.

485
00:25:04,856 --> 00:25:06,844
They fear they're
coming down the road.

486
00:25:06,844 --> 00:25:08,523
That's very tough crucial Kath.

487
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:12,751
much sexier than my conservative partners
would ever be, I promise you that.

488
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:17,696
Well.. if you here anything.

489
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:22,986
Dickie.

490
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:30,691
There was something
about the robbery.

491
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:34,764
It won't circle back to you.

492
00:25:34,764 --> 00:25:36,640
I swear it.

493
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:43,982
Well, I didn't think very much of it at the time
until I realized that it was cab from the press.

494
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:49,840
Hi.

495
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,758
Hey.

496
00:25:51,454 --> 00:25:52,947
- Can we talk?
- Yeah, it's clean.

497
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,178
There is money
missing from the bank.

498
00:25:57,178 --> 00:25:58,381
Where did you get this.

499
00:25:58,381 --> 00:26:00,771
Friend of mine works for law
firm representing the bank.

500
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:03,676
I asked him, but the Pellicano
theory and he left in my face,

501
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:08,453
but then he coughed up information
about'em, missing 200 grand.

502
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:09,974
Wow, that would
explain the bugging.

503
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:12,987
Someone thinks that one of us took the
money while we were inside the bank.

504
00:26:12,987 --> 00:26:15,937
Well, that cash, Lizzie certainly wouldn't
need to use her credit cards or ATM.

505
00:26:15,937 --> 00:26:16,771
Oh, come one.

506
00:26:16,771 --> 00:26:19,338
She found out Jeremy and Franny sleeping
together, it's good time to boat.

507
00:26:19,338 --> 00:26:21,561
How could you've possibly
gotten the money out of the bank.

508
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:23,729
She stashed it some place,
came back to get it later.

509
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:27,208
Are we really thinking this?

510
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:30,990
No.

511
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,883
No way.

512
00:26:33,094 --> 00:26:33,968
Right?

513
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:35,118
Right.

514
00:27:02,935 --> 00:27:04,331
Malcolm Jones

515
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,754
Malcome, hey, it's Nick.
How are you doing?

516
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:10,347
Well, I just went ballistic on my new
security guard because he looked at me fully.

517
00:27:10,347 --> 00:27:11,419
Any word on Lizzie?

518
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:12,754
Nothing yet.

519
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:14,540
but I've got to ask you

520
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,738
She'd ever been
back to the bank?

521
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:19,352
- No.
- Sure?

522
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:22,103
Well, not while I was here, certainly.

523
00:27:22,103 --> 00:27:24,950
Someone would've told me if she had,
they would recognize her, why?

524
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,747
Because there is money missing.
I assume you don't know about that.

525
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,501
No.

526
00:27:32,624 --> 00:27:35,161
I would've thought the
bank would've told me.

527
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:36,111
Yeah, me too.

528
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:39,883
So what is this mean?

529
00:27:39,883 --> 00:27:41,996
I don't know yet.
Let me call you back later.

530
00:27:41,996 --> 00:27:43,393
- Okay.
- Thanks.

531
00:27:45,595 --> 00:27:47,328
She's never been back there.

532
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:51,174
Hey.

533
00:27:51,174 --> 00:27:52,633
- Um..
- It's alright.

534
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:56,825
I got hid on that note, figureprint's belong
to Sam Blackwell, ex-con, he's still in LA.

535
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:58,853
Thanks, man. It's the
best news I've had all day.

536
00:27:58,853 --> 00:27:59,564
I better check on this.

537
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:00,818
I'll go back to work.

538
00:28:04,176 --> 00:28:05,152
Hey.

539
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,397
I'm not hungry.

540
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,959
You haven't eaten
all day, come on.

541
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:16,387
Thank you.

542
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:18,131
Thank you doing all of this.

543
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:19,057
Of course.

544
00:28:19,057 --> 00:28:20,362
No, not of course.

545
00:28:20,362 --> 00:28:21,999
I mean you barely
know this really.

546
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:24,439
I think we all know each
other better than you think.

547
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:29,357
I found this,

548
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:30,740
buried in a drawer.

549
00:28:31,888 --> 00:28:34,519
There is this image
I can't get out of my head.

550
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,528
What's that?

551
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:37,676
Lizzie sitting at a bus stop.

552
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:40,395
She was 14 years old.

553
00:28:40,395 --> 00:28:42,823
Her parents just told her
they were getting a divorce.

554
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:45,013
So she packed up
little nap sack.

555
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:48,521
broke up her piggy bank and
thought one way to get into Chicago.

556
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,263
And of course her parents
found her and took her home, but..

557
00:28:53,263 --> 00:28:57,642
that image of her,
sitting there alone..

558
00:28:57,642 --> 00:28:59,844
whine to escape.

559
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,138
Hello.

560
00:29:06,138 --> 00:29:08,017
Yeah.

561
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:10,090
Okay.

562
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:14,175
No, I don't..
ok, thanks.

563
00:29:14,973 --> 00:29:18,090
It was Cooper, she just
got charge on her ATM card

564
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,353
a couple hours ago,
gas station outside Tucson.

565
00:29:20,353 --> 00:29:22,023
That's great!
That's great news!

566
00:29:22,023 --> 00:29:23,801
Yeah, if it was
her using her card,

567
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:26,514
but whoever used the card would've
to put in a pin numbers so..

568
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,066
So, it was hers.
It's gotta be her.

569
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,958
She doesn't know anybody in Tucson.
No idea what she might be doing there.

570
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:32,265
We'll figure it out.

571
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,390
Tucson, Arizona...

572
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,033
Wait a second, this is
from girls' summer camp.

573
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:40,993
It's from Montana..

574
00:29:40,993 --> 00:29:43,457
Yeah, I don't see any numbers from
Arizona in here, been through three times.

575
00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:46,036
Somebody did something to her,

576
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:47,373
took her pin number.

577
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:51,270
Hey.

578
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:55,821
I think I know
where she might be.

579
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:57,588
You said she got
gas in Tucson, right?

580
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:58,133
Yeah.

581
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:02,240
Well, she told me something
while we were in the bank.

582
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,424
Yeah?

583
00:30:04,926 --> 00:30:06,541
She was engaged once.

584
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,186
Her first year on
graduate school,

585
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:09,336
to one of her professors.

586
00:30:09,336 --> 00:30:12,437
and he broke up with her,
and that's why she decided to transfer to DC, LA.

587
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:13,414
She's never told me about this.

588
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:14,687
I don't think she
ever told anybody.

589
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,464
I don't think she would've said anything
to me if we weren't stuck in that bank,

590
00:30:17,464 --> 00:30:20,054
thinking we would never
gonna make it out of there.

591
00:30:20,054 --> 00:30:21,263
talking about her regrets.

592
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,752
Well, who is this guy?

593
00:30:22,752 --> 00:30:23,631
I told you.

594
00:30:23,631 --> 00:30:27,766
He was her professor and she never told me his
name, she just said that he lives in Sedona now.

595
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:29,155
There was a guy,

596
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:32,653
in here with a university address, it was
Wisconsin number that would've been disconnected.

597
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:33,581
maybe he moved.

598
00:30:44,598 --> 00:30:46,469
You seem happy.

599
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,675
I am, Lizzie.

600
00:30:51,028 --> 00:30:51,994
Shall we sit?

601
00:30:55,892 --> 00:30:58,675
Why did you break
off our engagement?

602
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:03,109
Well, there's no wastin'
any time with pleasant trees

603
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:04,102
Why don't we get right to it.

604
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:04,984
I'm sorry.

605
00:31:04,984 --> 00:31:06,740
I've driven 800 miles.

606
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:12,066
I've slept total of 4 hours and I haven't changed my
clothes in 3 days, so I thought we might get to the point.

607
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,050
Well, I told you then.

608
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:19,733
I was too busy packing my
bags to hear words you said.

609
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:20,569
Remember?

610
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:22,183
What is the matter, now?

611
00:31:23,313 --> 00:31:24,924
I pushed you away.

612
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,491
Lizzie..

613
00:31:25,491 --> 00:31:26,926
That's what I do, right?

614
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,425
I push people away.

615
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,456
What's all the urgency for.

616
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:31,990
after all this time.

617
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,580
Why don't you just
answer my question.

618
00:31:35,864 --> 00:31:37,120
Okay.

619
00:31:41,406 --> 00:31:42,686
You um..

620
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:47,132
You always kept up piece
of yourself from moved,

621
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:51,050
and often I felt... alone,

622
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,826
even when I was with you.

623
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,786
You were young, Lizzie.

624
00:31:59,957 --> 00:32:02,214
I don't know how
much I've changed.

625
00:32:03,364 --> 00:32:04,464
Look.

626
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,646
I saw you on the news.

627
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:11,761
I know what happened at the bank.
You must be very dramatic.

628
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,747
I have family, now.

629
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:19,989
It's probably my wife.

630
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:22,551
Hello.

631
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:25,108
Yes.

632
00:32:27,843 --> 00:32:29,536
Hold on, please.

633
00:32:29,536 --> 00:32:32,042
It's for you.

634
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:33,741
Kathryn Hale?

635
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:38,671
Kathryn?

636
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:39,734
Lizzie?

637
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:41,154
How did you find me here?

638
00:32:41,154 --> 00:32:42,691
We've all been looking for you.

639
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:44,817
We've been worried and sick.
Didn't you get our messages?

640
00:32:44,817 --> 00:32:47,981
um. I'm so sorry,
I didn't know.

641
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:51,496
My cell phone ran out of power,
and I gettin' out of my charger.

642
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,353
Lizzie, I...

643
00:32:54,353 --> 00:32:56,335
I know about Jeremy and Franny.

644
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:59,317
What are you doing?

645
00:32:59,784 --> 00:33:01,188
You're running away?

646
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:03,508
Leaving?

647
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:05,946
I don't know.

648
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:08,323
I...

649
00:33:08,323 --> 00:33:10,058
That's what I was
thinking I guess.

650
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:14,316
I wasn't really
thinking, I just reacted.

651
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:19,293
I drove about to Jacob's letter
and stared into space for 16 hours,

652
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,298
slept in my car.

653
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:22,708
drove some more.

654
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,895
and then I saw
roadside for Sedona,

655
00:33:25,895 --> 00:33:27,709
and I thought of my fiance.

656
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,359
Wait a minute, how did
you even know about him?

657
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:33,176
You told Franny
about him in the bank.

658
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,070
and she told Jeremy?

659
00:33:36,894 --> 00:33:39,118
What are you doing
out there, Lizzie?

660
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:40,466
I was in my car,

661
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:42,682
and I was thinking
about back then.

662
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:46,384
When he broke it up
with me what I did,

663
00:33:46,384 --> 00:33:52,258
I mean, transferred schools because
I couldn't deal with the rejection.

664
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:54,051
or trying to work it out.

665
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,047
I ran.

666
00:33:56,726 --> 00:34:01,053
never spoke to any of my
friends again. I just took off.

667
00:34:01,053 --> 00:34:04,306
Guess I thought I could
get answers from him now..

668
00:34:05,094 --> 00:34:07,467
about what I do to
make people run from me.

669
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:09,902
You don't do anything, sweetheart.

670
00:34:11,394 --> 00:34:12,869
People hurting each other..

671
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:15,277
feeling scared,
that's just life.

672
00:34:16,643 --> 00:34:18,311
Why don't you come home, Lizzie.

673
00:34:19,194 --> 00:34:21,452
There's a lot that we
need to fill you in on.

674
00:34:24,054 --> 00:34:25,543
- Sam Blackwell?
- Yeah.

675
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,377
You're being watched?

676
00:34:27,377 --> 00:34:27,721
What?

677
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:30,038
Oh, come on, man.
Your prints all over the note.

678
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:30,698
You're a cop?

679
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:32,448
I ain't Santa Clause.

680
00:34:32,448 --> 00:34:33,435
Come on, what's the deal?

681
00:34:33,435 --> 00:34:34,744
Who put you up to?

682
00:34:34,744 --> 00:34:37,180
I'll tell you, will you leave
my pro officer out of it?

683
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,295
Why do you think we are doing
this out here, not the station.

684
00:34:41,243 --> 00:34:42,979
Buddy of mine..

685
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:44,114
- Skeet.
- Skeet?

686
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:46,422
Skeet McCormick.
He just got out of county.

687
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:48,893
I guess he wanted the other
inmates us someone to do it.

688
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:50,468
He paid my grand for the job.

689
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:52,996
Skeet was too nervous
to do it by himself so..

690
00:34:52,996 --> 00:34:55,106
he offered me $500 if I do it.

691
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:56,766
You said he just got
out of county, when?

692
00:34:56,766 --> 00:34:58,344
- Exactly.
- Like 2 days ago.

693
00:34:58,344 --> 00:35:00,375
Did he ever mention Lucas Dalton

694
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,757
He's the guy from that
bank robbery, isn't he?

695
00:35:02,757 --> 00:35:03,641
Yeah.

696
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:06,102
Bragging about being
in a cell next to him.

697
00:35:06,102 --> 00:35:08,098
guess he's big
celebrity in there.

698
00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:11,873
Did he do something to you?

699
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:13,301
What?

700
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:14,791
Who?

701
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,363
It wasn't him.

702
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:44,044
<i>Target is in sight.
You gotta shoot.

703
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:45,834
What is that?

704
00:35:48,637 --> 00:35:50,216
Everybody get down!

705
00:36:47,182 --> 00:36:48,086
Hey!

706
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:49,351
Egan.

707
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:50,591
What are you doing here?

708
00:36:50,591 --> 00:36:52,025
Cooking dinner,
what is it look like?

709
00:36:52,025 --> 00:36:54,330
It's 4:00 in the morning.

710
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,364
Yep.

711
00:36:56,778 --> 00:36:58,313
Jeremy would've been here.

712
00:36:58,313 --> 00:37:00,227
He's trying to give
you a little space,

713
00:37:00,227 --> 00:37:01,479
really wants to
talk to you though.

714
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,165
Three days..

715
00:37:08,735 --> 00:37:10,099
We know.

716
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:11,197
No.

717
00:37:12,302 --> 00:37:14,859
That how long
I knew I was pregnant.

718
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:17,997
3 days and I
didn't tell Jeremy.

719
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,531
We slept together, we ate dinner
together, we went to work together, and..

720
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:26,354
I kept it to myself.

721
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:32,086
If I would've told him..
before we went into the bank,

722
00:37:32,086 --> 00:37:34,674
everything would've
been different.

723
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:38,004
Well, you're right, but uh..

724
00:37:38,004 --> 00:37:39,445
you never would've met us.

725
00:37:40,096 --> 00:37:43,591
Hey, you were the one who make sure
we all stayed connected, remember?

726
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:44,605
Yeah..

727
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:47,112
What are you making?

728
00:37:47,112 --> 00:37:49,281
Indian, which I know
is your favorite.

729
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:54,191
I was gonna go vegetarian, and I remember that, now
you've been through some changes since the bank, so..

730
00:37:59,015 --> 00:37:59,826
Hey.

731
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,586
Kathryn said that you guys had
somethings you needed to tell me.

732
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,445
Let's just sit.
Let's eat first.

733
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:10,180
Okay?

734
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,921
Go.

735
00:38:26,485 --> 00:38:28,597
That's great.
Now give us a few.

736
00:38:38,797 --> 00:38:41,232
Skeet McCormick says hello.

737
00:38:42,985 --> 00:38:44,436
Why did you send the note?

738
00:38:44,436 --> 00:38:46,406
I wanted to warn Lizzie.

739
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:47,718
Obviously.

740
00:38:47,718 --> 00:38:49,598
and how did you know
she was being watched?

741
00:38:49,598 --> 00:38:50,778
My lawyer got a tip.

742
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:52,505
He told me, so
I'd stay from her.

743
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:53,631
Tip from who?

744
00:38:54,116 --> 00:38:55,256
Some fed.

745
00:38:55,714 --> 00:38:57,539
FBI?

746
00:38:57,539 --> 00:38:58,601
Who else?

747
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:01,592
Did you know that they
were watching all of us?

748
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:03,061
I had no idea.

749
00:39:03,463 --> 00:39:04,450
Why would they do that?

750
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,663
I was gonna ask you.

751
00:39:05,663 --> 00:39:07,862
I just figured they were
all over because of me.

752
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,969
She came to see me here.

753
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:11,356
Couple of times at the hospital.

754
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:15,780
200 grand is missing from the money
install, what do you know about that?

755
00:39:17,387 --> 00:39:19,153
- Nothing.
- Really?

756
00:39:19,153 --> 00:39:20,643
- Why would I?
- Maybe it was a payoff.

757
00:39:20,643 --> 00:39:22,543
- For what?
- Someone who supposed to help you that day.

758
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:23,554
Help me with what?

759
00:39:25,098 --> 00:39:26,765
I'm not sure exactly.

760
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:30,546
You think Lizzie was
a part of robbery.

761
00:39:30,546 --> 00:39:31,326
maybe.

762
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:34,588
Maybe you sent her the note because
she know she'd tell everyone else.

763
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:36,990
either way, you
accomplished the tip-off.

764
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,875
You're out of your mind.

765
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,707
- Am I?
- Yeah.

766
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:44,882
I want you to look me in
the eye and answer me this.

767
00:39:45,607 --> 00:39:47,925
Was anyone else
involved in the robbery?

768
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,923
One of us?

769
00:39:50,923 --> 00:39:53,252
Don't you think you would've
figured that out in 52 hours?

770
00:39:53,252 --> 00:39:54,641
You haven't
answered my question.

771
00:39:57,653 --> 00:39:58,419
No.

772
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:02,423
It was just me and Randall.
