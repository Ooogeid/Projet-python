1
00:00:02,412 --> 00:00:03,717
Would you marry me?

2
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:05,257
Ed.. Ed proposed me.

3
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:06,979
Wow.

4
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:08,113
Excuse me. Mr. Mayor.

5
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:11,245
After the bank crisis,
I must say you've become quiet inspiration

6
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,685
to a lot of people.

7
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:13,644
We have news.

8
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:15,165
You're back together.

9
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:16,358
No, no..

10
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:17,698
Lizzie is pregnant.

11
00:00:18,245 --> 00:00:20,000
Why do you keep on coming here?

12
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:21,660
You've become important to me.

13
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,460
Are we really doing this?

14
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,595
"Turning Point"

15
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:32,158
Hi, Mr. Marley.
Good morning.

16
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:33,622
Mr. Foote.
You're early.

17
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:34,713
Oh.. no. Am I?

18
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:35,455
your message said 8:00.

19
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:37,133
I made a mental note.
Eight of us at 8:00.

20
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:39,406
I said 9:00 and it'll only be seven of you.

21
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:42,585
Felicia Jones won't be joining us
these interviews for obvious reasons.

22
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,625
Right, right, of course. Yes.

23
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:49,220
I wish I had no memory
of the whole thing myself.

24
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:51,778
Frankly, I have of..
been dreading this day

25
00:00:51,778 --> 00:00:53,280
And you are the first to arrive.

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,157
Yep, yep. part of my new credo
"go right at the fear".

27
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,975
but, my.. best foot.

28
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,314
forward so to speak.

29
00:00:59,314 --> 00:00:59,966
I'm glad.

30
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:03,084
So, um..
What are you gonna ask us today.

31
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:07,645
If you don't mind, I'd like to wait for the
others, so I don't have to repeat myself.

32
00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:09,347
Oh, all right, uh...

33
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:12,647
well, I'll be right out
here if you need me.

34
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,810
Mom, I do wanna see you.

35
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,684
It's just that I have
a lot going on today.

36
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:35,935
Yeah, look.
I have get up and get ready now.

37
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:39,084
Okay, yeah, I'll try to
call you tomorrow.

38
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,575
All right, bye.

39
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,879
She pressuring you?

40
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:47,702
Yeah..

41
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:51,645
Trying to make up
for lost time I guess.

42
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,258
well, we should get just
stay in our bed all day.

43
00:01:55,258 --> 00:01:57,576
mmmm. tell me about it all day.

44
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:03,303
Pulling off a band-aid,
better do it quick.

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,710
So are we taking the
separate cars to this thing?

46
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:09,514
I assume so.

47
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:13,146
You're not at all worried about
being in a room with Lizzie all day and

48
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:15,126
not being straight with her?

49
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:18,072
I thought you wanted to
wait and see where we were.

50
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,862
Well, we are something now,
aren't we?

51
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:29,232
I think facing today is
gonna be hard enough.

52
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,312
without adding that to
the mix, don't you?

53
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,933
I will tell Lizzie.

54
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,148
I will.

55
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:37,359
just not today.

56
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:43,948
I don't get it. I thought the
mayor was taking you to breakfast.

57
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:46,220
You do breakfast,
you don't actually eat breakfast.

58
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,153
I heard that Valerie Brooks is resigning
from the police commission tomorrow.

59
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:50,842
so they need another
skirt for the commission?

60
00:02:50,842 --> 00:02:54,153
They need a brilliant prosecutor
with a high conviction rate.

61
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:55,820
it just might be the
best male for the job.

62
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,743
Great.

63
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,913
Have you heard the mayor?

64
00:02:57,913 --> 00:03:01,266
He said so himself.
He's always had his eye on you.

65
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:03,757
Besides, when I'm elected to D.A.,

66
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,161
It will make it easier for me to
make you head of criminal prosecution.

67
00:03:07,162 --> 00:03:08,503
So, I'll see you this afternoon.

68
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:09,884
Commissioner Hale.

69
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:11,931
Certainly, District Attorney Nielson

70
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:14,031
I love it when you talk
dirty to me in public.

71
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:15,721
- See you.
- All right.

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,816
Kathryn Hale

73
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:21,773
Where?

74
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:24,879
- Ms. Hale?
- Yes.

75
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,159
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

76
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:35,136
I'll.. I'll look forward to it, Senator.

77
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:36,305
Okay, thank you.

78
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,001
Sorry for the change in plans, counselor.

79
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,228
I had to be in D.C. by 2:00.

80
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:42,743
I hope you weren't dying for eggs benedict.

81
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:45,185
I think I'll survive, sir.

82
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:45,652
Good.

83
00:03:47,212 --> 00:03:49,472
I've decided to offer you my endorsement.

84
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:50,992
for District Attorney.

85
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,647
You, uh.. you want me to run for D.A.?

86
00:03:58,647 --> 00:03:59,658
That's right.

87
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,685
But, Ed has been expecting this.

88
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:07,498
Expectations aren't guarantees, Ms. Hale.

89
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:09,625
Ed is a traffic prosecutor.

90
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,065
Don't get me wrong.

91
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,561
That doesn't make him
a great candidate.

92
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:15,221
Politics is a moody game.

93
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,781
People like the flavor of the month.

94
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:19,868
And I'm the flavor.

95
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:23,716
Your courage inspires people.

96
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:28,712
You can't buy that kind of credibility with the public.

97
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:33,399
Sometimes, the best parts of us
shine through during a crisis.

98
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:35,989
Your life is different now.

99
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,321
Your path is changed.

100
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,631
I mean one of the nine had put.

101
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:42,808
This is your moment.

102
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:47,801
I can't.

103
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,690
I can't.. I can't..

104
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,398
I understand how sensitive this is for you.

105
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:55,702
but you should know if you
decline out of loyalty to him,

106
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:58,442
the party will still back someone else.

107
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,360
Are you saying that Ed is out?

108
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:06,717
Just tell me that you are not interested.

109
00:05:06,718 --> 00:05:10,468
I will forget, this whole
conversation never happened.

110
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:19,387
Good, good.

111
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,386
We'll talk more in a few days.

112
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:23,886
I look forward to working with you.

113
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:27,494
I know I difficult this is going to be.

114
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,540
to relive this event.

115
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,521
but I need to get the facts straight.

116
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:35,978
which means I may have to recall each of you
several times to confirm your testimony or review,

117
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:37,693
anything new that might come up.

118
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:40,250
So, we are gonna be here all day.

119
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,290
There is a coffee shop cross the street,

120
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,013
plenty of waiting space here.

121
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:47,615
If you stay close and leave your
cell phones on, that would be fine.

122
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:49,200
Detective Cavanaugh.

123
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,530
You still with me?

124
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,167
Yeah, I know the draw.

125
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,857
done this thousand time.

126
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:56,691
Sorry, I'm late, everybody.

127
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,453
Traffic.

128
00:05:58,136 --> 00:06:01,626
It's okay, Ms. Rios.
We're just getting started.

129
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:07,831
As you know, we are here to discuss the
events that led to the murder of Tom Mitchell.

130
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:10,620
On the surface,
the case looks simple.

131
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,186
but because only one of
you witnessed the crime,

132
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:15,986
and because the crime scene was
compromised after Tom's murder,

133
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:20,946
we need to rewind to all the
circumstances before and after his death.

134
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:24,776
I know it was chaotic in that bank.

135
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:29,117
that some of you did things under-stressed
you normally would not have.

136
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:33,136
Tom's death changed everything
for everyone in that bank.

137
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:35,222
That's what you'll tell
the jury when it's time.

138
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:38,062
That's what I need to hear about today.

139
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:40,121
So, who wants to go first.

143
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:17,360
SWAT heard the gunshot at 10:19 p.m.

144
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,698
Let's rewind a little to 6:30

145
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:21,840
Nancy Hale had just been released,

146
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,840
Malcolm Jones got the pizza from the plaza.

147
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:26,031
That was all I could think about.

148
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:29,001
the pizza, you know,
'cause I'm pregnant,

149
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:31,061
but no one else was eating.

150
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:33,271
Thank god Tom went first slice.

151
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:36,885
We're all left with our own thoughts.

152
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:41,393
Lucas and Randall were
whispering to each other.

153
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:43,046
They had asked for a helicopter

154
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,706
but, hadn't heard from a negotiator in over an hour

155
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:50,648
There were something
going on between them.

156
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:52,235
We didn't know what
they were thinking.

157
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:54,326
Hey, I said forget it!

158
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,160
Are you deaf?

159
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,017
Hey,

160
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:09,511
I'm Lizzie Miller.

161
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,245
I'm a social worker,

162
00:08:11,245 --> 00:08:12,537
how mercy feels.

163
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:17,147
What's your name?

164
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:19,527
Sorry, but can we just skip this?

165
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:21,815
You got some place else to be?

166
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:26,177
After I see the way these bastards handled
my mother, I just need a little quit time

167
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:28,104
Check out the Virgin Mary

168
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:31,709
...come to rescue lost souls.

169
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:34,001
I'm not a saint, girl.

170
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:36,081
I'm just trying to help.

171
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:39,779
I didn't even know
where we were at,

172
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,264
and had no right to say that stuff.

173
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:45,446
I thought getting to know
each other would humanize us.

174
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:48,048
I.. I was hoping that if they
could see us as people

175
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:52,064
instead of poker chips, that would
make it harder for them to hurt anyone.

176
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,495
So, where was Tom in all of this?

177
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:57,556
He was having a really hard time.

178
00:08:58,431 --> 00:09:00,351
He kept on blaming himself.

179
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:03,559
I didn't see him coming.

180
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,357
I just didn't see him coming...

181
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:07,679
I just saw.. see him coming

182
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,280
is that one a swan?

183
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:16,210
Yeah.

184
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,172
It's good.

185
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:21,554
Where did you learn origami?

186
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:23,110
Okinawa,

187
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,474
I used to station there in the Marines.

188
00:09:26,474 --> 00:09:30,234
I had a whole lot of time
on my hands in this job.

189
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:36,975
So, you were in handcuffs the whole time?

190
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:38,247
I was at that point.

191
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:39,796
So, you couldn't see
what was going on.

192
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:42,006
I could hear.
I had a sense of it.

193
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:43,067
And what did you sense?

194
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:45,025
That Lucas was trying to
keep things on a control.

195
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,052
And Randall?

196
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:51,454
Randall was getting off on him.

197
00:09:51,454 --> 00:09:53,364
Are we having any fun yet?

198
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,849
Come one, now.
Smile everybody.

199
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:57,949
Party's just getting underway.

200
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,854
We have to do something.

201
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:03,747
Like what?

202
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:06,315
There's nine of us and two of them.

203
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,866
What are you suggesting.

204
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:08,580
We rush them?

205
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,222
That's suicide, no way.

206
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:13,623
The way that, once he'd been drinking coffee,
he's gonna have to take a leak soon.

207
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:16,262
We rush the other one.
We get control of this.

208
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:17,533
Are you an idiot?

209
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,141
You are gonna get us all killed.

210
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:20,797
shh, he's listening.

211
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:27,235
You got a better idea?
Let's hear it.

212
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,232
You sit tight.

213
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:33,257
follow bank protocol avoid confrontation,
and let the authorities negotiate a solution.

214
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,397
They have been working
great for us so far.

215
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:41,333
Everyone was sort of at each
other's throats, you know.

216
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:43,645
And then, Franny came up with her plan.

217
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:44,975
And what was that?

218
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:48,362
I trust you'll really get into it.

219
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:50,095
We are all here to
discuss Tom's murderer.

220
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:53,030
I assure you any misdemeanors
performed under duress

221
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,890
will be of no consequence.

222
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:57,875
Turns out Franny had 30 hits of extacy

223
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,055
in my purse.

224
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:03,632
- If we just find a way to dose the scary guy...
- What are you doing with 30 hits of extacy.

225
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:04,725
It's Melissa's,

226
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:06,711
I was supposed to take it to a party tonight.

227
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:09,238
Extacy is a central nervous system inhibitor.

228
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:11,464
If we give him enough of it,
he'll pass out cold.

229
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:12,854
Then, we can put it in his water.

230
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:14,834
What about the better taste.

231
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:17,627
I tried it in college.

232
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:18,393
Once.

233
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,830
Coffee?

234
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,266
Would hide bitterness.

235
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,540
I hate to ruin your brilliant plan,

236
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,293
but these are straight drugs.

237
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:26,949
Yeah, so?

238
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:29,908
So, we don't know what's in them
or how strong they are.

239
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:33,277
Let's just say I know people
who tried this patch,

240
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,371
and it works.

241
00:11:34,371 --> 00:11:34,874
Hey!

242
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:37,745
News' trappers show SWAT in the back alley.

243
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:38,938
So?

244
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:42,538
Make the duck, big man, and
the guard, block up the back door.

245
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:44,798
I'll stay here with the ladies.

246
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,592
What?

247
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:49,672
Go on

248
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:51,472
before they bust in here.

249
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:57,638
Lucas took Jeremy, Malcolm,
and Tom to the back.

250
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:02,103
but Malcolm wouldn't go without Felicia,
so they took her too.

251
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:05,863
It was first time I have
been separated from Jeremy.

252
00:12:06,097 --> 00:12:08,588
But, that's not exactly true.

253
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:11,246
Lucas had taken me to the
bathroom couple of times,

254
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:15,316
but it was the first time
Jeremy had been taken from me.

255
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,592
Don't worry about your
little boyfriend, sweetheart.

256
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:20,273
I'll keep your company.

257
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:21,425
Hear, great.

258
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,352
Stand up.

259
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:37,490
Hey.

260
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,264
What are you doing?

261
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:42,138
One you'd like to know, little piggy.

262
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:45,120
Good.

263
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:47,891
Good, good, good.

264
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:52,466
Now, spin around.

265
00:12:57,802 --> 00:12:58,457
Hey!

266
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:00,601
Spin around for me.

267
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:03,221
Whatever you doing,
just let her be.

268
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:11,637
- Very, very nice.
- Hey.

269
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,150
Leave her alone.

270
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:17,215
Excuse me?

271
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,770
I went into the bank, thinking of killing myself that days,
watching him humiliate Lizzie.

272
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,360
Part of me said why don't
you just jump the guy.

273
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,450
I couldn't.

274
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:30,657
not that moment, not yet.

275
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:36,018
Don't.

276
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:37,868
Don't.

277
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:40,414
Why won't you say please.

278
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:46,092
Please.

279
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:49,558
Don't.

280
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:52,343
Good.

281
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,064
Now, sit your ass back now.

282
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:04,335
Are you all right?

283
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,150
Yeah.

284
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,696
I saw what he did to her.

285
00:14:08,697 --> 00:14:11,925
And I knew that he could
mess with any of us.

286
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:15,926
I wasn't about to let that
happen to me, or my sister.

287
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:17,319
or anybody else.

288
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:19,229
I don't care what happens.

289
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:22,622
I'm gonna do it to
that son of a bitch.

290
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:25,326
Who's with me.

291
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:33,500
Come in.

292
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:37,736
- Oh, excuse me, uh.. Ed, I was..
- Speak of the devil,

293
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:41,097
Kathryn Hale, meet Andrea Williams,
my campaign consultant.

294
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:42,559
Pleasure, heard so much about you.

295
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,262
Oh, you guys have been
talking about me.

296
00:14:44,262 --> 00:14:47,980
Ed has made it clear that he does not
want his campaign to impose on you.

297
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,913
I told her how you feel
about being arm candy

298
00:14:49,913 --> 00:14:51,460
but I'm making him ask.

299
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,870
Is there any chance you
could do of few appearances.

300
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,312
Your image is a major asset for him.

301
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,362
I, I, can I just borrow
him for a second?

302
00:14:58,362 --> 00:15:00,672
Mr. Nielson, the D.A.'s on one.

303
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:02,162
Hold on, Kath.

304
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:03,675
Just take a second.

305
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:04,951
Hey, Bill!

306
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,383
What's up?

307
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:12,084
Really?

308
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:14,779
Wow.

309
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:19,459
oh, obviously,
this is a big disappointment.

310
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:21,585
Yeah.

311
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:23,027
Thanks.

312
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,627
Lunch on Tuesday.
I'll see you then.

313
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:26,126
Bye.

314
00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:31,616
Oh, Andrew, will you
give us a moment?

315
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:32,766
Oh, sure, yeah.

316
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:39,051
What are you doing?

317
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,676
Ed, I came back here

318
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:42,436
- to talk to you to try to figure this out.
- He's already set

319
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:46,446
an exploratory strategy meeting
for you with the party brass on Friday.

320
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:51,916
- Look, Ed, that is not what we talked about. I..
- You didn't say no, Kath.

321
00:15:52,222 --> 00:15:54,185
- Ed, I, I was..
- I mean I've been in line for this.

322
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:56,215
for the last five years now.

323
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:59,014
He told me you were out.

324
00:15:59,148 --> 00:15:59,761
Either way.

325
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:01,070
Of course that's what he told you.

326
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,274
- Ed, I don't know it. I, I..
- Why weren't you there for all the photo ops?

327
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:03,981
I will say no.

328
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:04,757
It's too late.

329
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:05,886
My blood's in the water now.

330
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:06,841
Bill's backing off.

331
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,531
City counsel chair, too.

332
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,842
All I did was take a breath,
and think about it.

333
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:16,915
I'm doing court.

334
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:24,085
So, Ms. Hale changed her mind,
and decided to help you with her plan.

335
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:25,212
and Eva too.

336
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:28,061
we just had to find out way
to get the E out of my purse

337
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:29,701
without Randall knowing.

338
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,739
Hey, you got my helicopter?

339
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:39,877
well, then stop calling, bitch!

340
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:44,612
Sorry.

341
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:47,829
I.. I need to ask you a favor.

342
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,710
One addict to another.

343
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:55,036
I'm having a really bad nick fit.

344
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:57,751
You wanna smoke?

345
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:58,552
No.

346
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,364
I need um, I need one nicotine gum,
it's on my purse.

347
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:02,843
um, you take that.

348
00:17:02,843 --> 00:17:05,413
Bad time to quit smoking, sweetheart.

349
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:09,225
I'm sure you wouldn't
knock a nice cigarette.

350
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:14,019
Look, I bet my sister that
I wouldn't make it until Christmas.

351
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,720
Yeah, that's it.

352
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:46,375
Thank you.

353
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,056
You don't find any surprises.

354
00:17:58,412 --> 00:17:59,054
Hey!

355
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,515
Where is a dog.

356
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:01,361
Bathroom.

357
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:02,585
No worry.

358
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:03,319
Check.

359
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,393
Thank you.

360
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,960
I really appreciate eat this.

361
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:21,639
It was wild.

362
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:24,614
I mean here was this girl.
I had just met.

363
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:26,228
Didn't know her at all.

364
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:29,812
When she grabbed those pills,
snuck them right out underneath Randall's nose.

365
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:32,668
You said she ground up
the pills with her hills?

366
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:34,092
Yeah, but there was no way.

367
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:37,893
we were gonna get this stuff
into Randall's mug, no way.

368
00:18:37,894 --> 00:18:41,768
and just when we thought our
plan was gonna fall through,

369
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:43,638
Randall solved our problem.

370
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:51,495
This coffee taste like piss.

371
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:58,453
One of your employees needs to make me a fresh pot?

372
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:00,025
I'll do it.

373
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:00,919
No.

374
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,401
You.

375
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:04,445
You do it.

376
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:17,418
So, you knew something was up?

377
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:18,182
Yeah.

378
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,710
But, believe me. I had no idea what.

379
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,596
and if you had?

380
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:22,727
I would try to stop it.

381
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:23,647
Why is that?

382
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:25,841
It was a stupid plan.

383
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:29,795
Randall had this slight suspicion
they were trying to get to him.

384
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,835
He could've killed everybody.

385
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:35,512
Thank you.

386
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:37,232
Eva.

387
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:11,401
Is it okay if I stretch for a second?

388
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:13,635
My back is killing me.

389
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:17,830
Yeah, make it fast.

390
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:25,798
Randall!

391
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:26,424
Tom!

392
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:28,484
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

393
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:29,201
Hey!

394
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:30,787
I can't move my leg. It's..

395
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:34,766
Oh, god, little children sit there
hell back down. Back off, duck!

396
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,267
I ain't that stupid.

397
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,238
I can't feel my legs.

398
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,775
Nice try running, cop.

399
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:42,590
Showtime is over, get up!

400
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,952
What are you doing?
He's sick!

401
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,260
hell he is.

402
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,340
You, take a look at him now.

403
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:50,024
It's Tom, right?

404
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:51,677
Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.

405
00:20:51,677 --> 00:20:52,564
Head up.

406
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:54,943
Good.

407
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:57,531
Where are we, Tom?

408
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:58,701
Where are we?

409
00:20:58,701 --> 00:21:00,241
- In the bank.
- Okay, good.

410
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:01,737
Where is Judith..

411
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:04,975
Where is Judith!

412
00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:06,241
What the hell is he talking about?

413
00:21:06,241 --> 00:21:07,344
Who's Judith?

414
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:08,434
It's his wife.

415
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:11,257
Don't try to talk now.

416
00:21:11,257 --> 00:21:12,609
Please..

417
00:21:16,128 --> 00:21:20,258
I hoping to close the bank
with Tom everyday for 8 years.

418
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:23,562
He was a devoted husband,

419
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,093
good man.

420
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,837
Mr. Jones.

421
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:32,585
You know, Tom's wife is very sick.

422
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:35,545
It says Judith who's
suing the bank now.

423
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:40,048
He was always worried about her.

424
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:44,721
How they would survive
if the bank would of cut staff, or

425
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:49,691
if god forbid anything
happened to him.

426
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:54,191
Hey, Hey!

427
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:55,731
You need to see this.

428
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,781
That's cerebral spinal fluid.

429
00:21:57,781 --> 00:22:02,991
When you hit him, you ruptured his blood net, so and his brain.
You don't get him to a hospital, he will die.

430
00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:04,631
I gotta get him out of here.

431
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:05,621
Listen, we can't let him die.

432
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:09,101
No, you listen, no way,
no way, no way, no way.

433
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:11,474
The only thing we got
on our side is them,

434
00:22:11,474 --> 00:22:13,126
and I ain't let anymore of them go,

435
00:22:13,126 --> 00:22:18,036
and I'm calling to shots from here, and you
don't like it, you can walk out that door, right now.

436
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,296
I'll be just fine!

437
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,673
What the hell would you wanna do then?

438
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:21,304
huh?

439
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:24,894
He dies in here, that's a felony homicide,
you get the death penalty.

440
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:28,352
- Both of you will get the death penalty.
- Shut up! Shut up!

441
00:22:28,353 --> 00:22:30,674
Everybody shuts up, so I can think.

442
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:36,165
I couldn't see the damn thing, but I new that Randall was
freaking out, scared which is not how I wanted him

443
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:38,115
and Lucas was ready to
go up against the man.

444
00:22:38,115 --> 00:22:39,615
So, what did you do?

445
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:42,934
Again, I was little limited.

446
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:45,204
I just meant what happened next.

447
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:51,128
Randall wanted Tom off the floor, so we
made Jeremy help care him into the bathroom.

448
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:54,012
<i>There's ambulances and
EMT is right out on the plaza.</i>

449
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:55,239
<i>... get him out there!</i>

450
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,307
<i>No! No way!</i>

451
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:58,342
<i>There is gotta be something
you can do in here.</i>

452
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:00,274
<i>You are a doctor.
You fix it!</i>

453
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:02,855
<i>He needs surgery,
or he's going to die.</i>

454
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:04,066
I'm telling you.

455
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:09,034
You get the sick eye out of here,
they're gonna go much easier on you later.

456
00:23:09,035 --> 00:23:11,168
I need to go

457
00:23:11,168 --> 00:23:12,282
in there.

458
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:13,569
I, I need to help Jeremy.

459
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:14,960
I can't let you do that, sit down.

460
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,005
please..

461
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:16,916
I'm begging you.

462
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,230
Just sit down!

463
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,206
It's gonna be okay.

464
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:20,586
I'll be all right.

465
00:23:20,745 --> 00:23:23,316
<i>You are gonna fix him here!
You're a doctor. You fix it!</i>

466
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:24,377
<i>He needs surgery, or..</i>

467
00:23:24,378 --> 00:23:26,340
<i>There is nothing I can do!
Do you understand me?<i>

468
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,180
<i>I can't save him!</i>

469
00:23:31,752 --> 00:23:32,626
Oh..

470
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:47,058
Hey.

471
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:49,071
Hey.

472
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,951
Long day, huh?

473
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:54,077
kind of like being hostage again.

474
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:02,742
Going over all this

475
00:24:04,282 --> 00:24:05,862
moment by moment.

476
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,372
I remembered

477
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:11,891
when Randall took
Jeremy and Tom away.

478
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:17,189
I was a stranger to you,
and you were really kind to me.

479
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:22,921
I thought Jeremy had
been killed that I'd lost him.

480
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,470
turns out I was right.

481
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:29,065
just not the way I thought.

482
00:24:32,977 --> 00:24:36,578
Now, the ME's report said
it was a subdural hematoma.

483
00:24:36,578 --> 00:24:38,324
He had a bleed on the dura.

484
00:24:38,324 --> 00:24:39,828
that out of membrane of the brain.

485
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:44,662
gradually blood fills the gap between the brain
and the skull, nowhere to go pressure builds on the brain.

486
00:24:44,662 --> 00:24:47,738
so, the symptoms may not appear
for minutes or even hours?

487
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:49,597
Maybe small headache?

488
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:51,805
that gets progressively worse.

489
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:55,748
So, once these symptoms appear, you have to do
something fast, or brain damage or even death can result.

490
00:24:55,748 --> 00:24:56,848
I told Randall.

491
00:24:57,976 --> 00:25:00,306
You have to relieve the pressure.

492
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:05,979
His pulse is down to 50. But listen,
he's still with us. You can still save him.

493
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:09,482
There's ambulances and EMT is right out on the plaza.
So, all you gotta do is get him out.

494
00:25:09,482 --> 00:25:11,024
No! No way!

495
00:25:11,996 --> 00:25:14,411
You're going to fix him here.
You're a doctor. You fix it.

496
00:25:14,411 --> 00:25:16,732
He needs surgery,
or he's going to die!

497
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:19,773
I'm not sending him out there,
you fix him right here!

498
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:20,905
I can't!

499
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:23,572
I can't here, not like this.
He needs a hospital.

500
00:25:23,572 --> 00:25:26,375
There is nothing I can do!
Do you understand me?

501
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:27,695
I can't save him!

502
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,712
Everybody stay calm.

503
00:25:36,712 --> 00:25:37,815
Don't panic.

504
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:40,674
No!

505
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:42,776
- What the hell did you..
- I told him to fix him!

506
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:43,932
I told him!

507
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,115
just take it easy,
tell me what happened.

508
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:49,038
take it easy!

509
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:51,900
The FBI is gonna come now
to find out what's going on.

510
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,290
You have to answer.

511
00:25:54,858 --> 00:25:57,428
Randall, just tell me
what happened.

512
00:25:58,132 --> 00:26:00,404
Randall! tell me what happened!

513
00:26:00,404 --> 00:26:02,074
I told him to fix him.

514
00:26:09,822 --> 00:26:11,036
He shot Tom.

515
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:13,304
He's dead.

516
00:26:19,053 --> 00:26:22,833
so, how far were you from Tom
when Randall shot him.

517
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:24,713
about a foot?

518
00:26:26,267 --> 00:26:27,427
away, maybe two?

519
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:33,111
Death was instantaneous.
He didn't suffer.

520
00:26:35,473 --> 00:26:36,743
He didn't suffer.

521
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:21,241
Dr. Kates, do you need a moment?

522
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:32,676
It's okay. I'm fine.

523
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:38,499
I said I'm fine, okay?

524
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:51,048
It's alright...

525
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:54,194
Dr. Kates?

526
00:27:58,347 --> 00:28:00,077
Yes, I'd like a moment.

527
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:19,250
Dr. Kates came out of the bathroom, covered in blood
and told us that Tom Mitchell had been murdered.

528
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:20,976
That was pretty much it.

529
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:23,886
And what was Randall Reese state of mind?

530
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,524
He was off his chain.

531
00:29:26,537 --> 00:29:27,627
I'm so stupid.

532
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,422
I'm so stupid.

533
00:29:29,422 --> 00:29:30,868
- I'm so stupid.
- Hey!

534
00:29:30,868 --> 00:29:32,308
It's gonna be okay.

535
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:33,715
I need you here with me.

536
00:29:33,715 --> 00:29:35,797
Randall! Listen to me,
listen to me!

537
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:37,051
It's always been you and me.

538
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:39,311
I can't do this without you.

539
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,106
You and me, you and me.

540
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:42,076
ah huh?

541
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:44,133
Kkka!!!!

542
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,926
Hey.

543
00:29:55,612 --> 00:29:58,052
You gotta get him on your control.

544
00:29:58,744 --> 00:30:00,333
Look at Randall if I can.

545
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,419
I've never seen him like this before.

546
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:05,086
Look, the phones are not ringing.

547
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,516
They are not calling to ask if anyone's hurt

548
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,143
because they are assuming the worst.

549
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:10,954
They are coming.

550
00:30:10,954 --> 00:30:12,408
That's a fight you can't win.

551
00:30:12,408 --> 00:30:13,125
I know that.

552
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,298
Does he?

553
00:30:14,298 --> 00:30:15,397
Hey!

554
00:30:16,392 --> 00:30:18,842
What are you two
whispering about?

555
00:30:19,744 --> 00:30:21,030
I gotta get on the phone.

556
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,623
I gotta tell them not to come in.

557
00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:24,875
Hey, let the dogs come in.

558
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,315
We'll shoot it out.

559
00:30:27,382 --> 00:30:29,119
Go out with our boots on.

560
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,496
- Is that what you want?
- Of course not.

561
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,196
Then let me make the call.

562
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,296
If you don't, he's gonna
take everyone with him.

563
00:30:34,296 --> 00:30:36,333
Do you want everyone here to die?

564
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:36,983
Hey!

565
00:30:38,984 --> 00:30:41,014
Are you gonna listen to him?

566
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,376
Are you gonna listen to me?

567
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:53,217
This is Detective Nick Cavanaugh,
who've I got.

568
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:54,975
Steve Bartlett, FBI.

569
00:30:54,975 --> 00:30:56,404
Now, listen to me.

570
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:59,933
Whatever you heard,
the hostages are not in danger.

571
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:01,297
So, stand down.

572
00:31:01,297 --> 00:31:02,757
Do not come in.

573
00:31:03,338 --> 00:31:04,472
Is anyone hurt?

574
00:31:04,472 --> 00:31:06,345
No, no one is hurt.

575
00:31:06,345 --> 00:31:08,201
A shot was fired,
but it was an accident,

576
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,955
so stand down.

577
00:31:10,486 --> 00:31:11,791
So you lied to SWAT.

578
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,313
It was our only option.

579
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:14,229
Why is that?

580
00:31:14,229 --> 00:31:17,093
They barricaded the back doors.
The front door was the only way in.

581
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:21,614
Randall had the perfect defensive position behind tellers'
counters, leaving the rest of us exposed cross fire.

582
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:24,122
He was willing to take all of us
with him if he came to that.

583
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:26,117
SWAT came in in the end,
then it worked.

584
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,358
That was a very different situation,

585
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:30,266
we were a long way from it.

586
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:33,561
There is no gun to my head.
If you don't believe me, put my CEO on the line.

587
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:36,594
Pete Burton, will help
you be able to read me.

588
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:37,703
We believe you Nick.

589
00:31:37,703 --> 00:31:40,843
SWAT's on code yellow,
we are standing now.

590
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,613
So, you talked to Pete?

591
00:31:43,018 --> 00:31:47,618
<i>Yes, Carole, we're hearing
for source code the FBI that..</i>

592
00:31:51,248 --> 00:31:52,868
What the hell is this?

593
00:31:54,193 --> 00:31:55,884
That would cut the life feed.

594
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:58,204
Why the hell would they do that?

595
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:01,815
They are coming in.

596
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,284
Yeah.

597
00:32:06,928 --> 00:32:10,105
You get into a situation like that and

598
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:12,675
you don't think about the rules.

599
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:15,405
All you think about is how to survive.

600
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:20,917
And with Randall, the way he was, the last thing any
of us wanted to see was SWAT come through that door.

601
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:22,937
I'm not going back to prison.

602
00:32:22,938 --> 00:32:25,078
I'm not going back to prison.

603
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:27,300
I'm not going back!

604
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,800
You're gonna have to kill me!

605
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,054
Killed all the circuits.

606
00:32:31,054 --> 00:32:32,733
You gotta get him on your control,

607
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:35,249
unless you want another
Waco on your hands here.

608
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,665
Can we get to SWAT?

609
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:38,510
Can you call them off?

610
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,285
They'll never pass me
through the SWAT directly.

611
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:45,544
I don't even know if I can trust the negotiator beyond
the same page with the guy that sensed the army in.

612
00:32:45,544 --> 00:32:46,985
What can we do?

613
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:51,192
Covered, Go!

614
00:32:55,064 --> 00:32:56,454
Moving on the door!

615
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,530
Stay back.

616
00:33:04,052 --> 00:33:05,644
Stay Back!

617
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:09,548
I'm Kathryn Hale.

618
00:33:11,512 --> 00:33:14,474
Assistant District Attorney Kathryn Hale.

619
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:17,804
They have everyone lined up
against the window.

620
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:26,410
I told you we were okay in here.
Just do what she says!

621
00:33:27,587 --> 00:33:29,346
If you do this,

622
00:33:30,856 --> 00:33:34,586
you will get innocent people killed.
Do you hear me?

623
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,150
Stand down!

624
00:33:55,652 --> 00:33:57,862
They say they're standing down!

625
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:05,636
Give me a signal.

626
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:09,335
I want a signal that everyone is standing down.

627
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:23,009
and what happened next?

628
00:34:24,848 --> 00:34:27,100
Nobody said anything for..

629
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,320
really long time.

630
00:34:30,345 --> 00:34:31,576
We were alive,

631
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:34,011
and Tom was dead.

632
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:40,409
and why did Tom get moved
from the bathroom?

633
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,239
That was Ev..

634
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:56,917
That was Eva.

635
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,549
She said we couldn't..

636
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:03,141
leave him there like that.

637
00:35:16,753 --> 00:35:18,083
No, wait a minute.

638
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:20,513
Just wait.

639
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,400
I had worked with the man for years.

640
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,490
I couldn't just drag him away
like a garbage bag.

641
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:30,033
Dear Lord,

642
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:34,175
None of us can explain why this man,

643
00:35:35,669 --> 00:35:38,803
our friend, Tom, has been lost

644
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:44,161
but it is in this time of darkness,
we know we have a choice

645
00:35:45,842 --> 00:35:49,956
to believe that we are
all here for reason now.

646
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,955
or to believe that the universe is a cold place.

647
00:35:54,955 --> 00:35:57,215
and our lives ain't no meaning.

648
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:04,679
Today, we attempted
to only see the darkness.

649
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:09,295
So, in this time, Lord.
when nothing makes sense.

650
00:36:09,295 --> 00:36:10,086
Please..

651
00:36:12,445 --> 00:36:14,033
show us the light.

652
00:36:15,011 --> 00:36:16,639
and welcome Tom home.

653
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:24,958
and that's where we laid him to rest

654
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,290
for the time.

655
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:34,244
I think that will do it
for today, Mr. Jones.

656
00:36:34,244 --> 00:36:38,094
I certainly appreciate you
taking the time to do this.

657
00:36:43,874 --> 00:36:46,295
Lizzie, it's me trying you again.

658
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:48,296
Call me back, okay?

659
00:36:51,702 --> 00:36:53,082
She won't pick up.

660
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:54,811
What should we do?

661
00:36:56,233 --> 00:36:57,406
Let's go home.

662
00:36:59,936 --> 00:37:02,786
I got Kates and Rios,
heading your way.

663
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:09,655
Hey!

664
00:37:13,094 --> 00:37:14,764
can't see you all day.

665
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:16,979
I was in and out a lot.

666
00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:20,819
oh, well, but I waited.
I.. I have something for you.

667
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,318
Tom made it.

668
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:26,288
Last thing he did, I think.

669
00:37:29,427 --> 00:37:31,097
and you held on to it?

670
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,270
but you do hardly knew the man.

671
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:41,487
I came to your bank, feeling..

672
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:43,816
pretty low about myself.

673
00:37:43,816 --> 00:37:46,225
I couldn't do things.
I didn't do much at all

674
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:49,684
but when you spoke
that day over Tom, it uh..

675
00:37:50,826 --> 00:37:52,386
lifted up part of me.

676
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:54,231
Really?

677
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:57,741
Yeah, you had to gun on in.
The marching orders were: take Tom away.

678
00:37:57,741 --> 00:38:03,467
you stopped, you said no, I wanna
memorialize my friend, you did that. You did it.

679
00:38:03,468 --> 00:38:05,846
gave me, gave me hope.

680
00:38:05,846 --> 00:38:07,344
and you spoke quiet beautifully,

681
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:08,327
by my say

682
00:38:10,149 --> 00:38:12,299
You have a real gift, Malcolm.

683
00:38:15,732 --> 00:38:16,911
Thank you, Egan.

684
00:38:18,043 --> 00:38:18,741
Thank you.

685
00:38:18,741 --> 00:38:20,006
I'm starving.

686
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,245
You want something from the diner?

687
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:23,400
- Yeah.
- Sounds great.

688
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,950
Sounds funny I have the strongest
hankering for a cup of coffee.

689
00:39:42,188 --> 00:39:43,928
My name is Kathryn Hale.

690
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,099
My name is Eva Rios.

691

Franny Rios.

692
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,189
We are sisters.

693
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,231
in case you hear us fighting.

694
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:59,157
I'm Egan Foote.

695
00:39:59,157 --> 00:40:00,717
Nice to meet you all,

696
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,264
under the many circumstances.

697
00:40:03,697 --> 00:40:07,174
I'm Malcolm Jones.
I'm the manager of this bank, and uh

698
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:09,340
- this is..
- Felicia Jones.

699
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,597
His daughter.

700
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:11,820
Hi

701
00:40:14,103 --> 00:40:15,339
