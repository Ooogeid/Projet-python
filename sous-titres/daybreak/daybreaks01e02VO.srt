2
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:40,267
I love you.

3
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,949
You're so sweet.

4
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,806
I've wanted you to meet my mom
for so long.

5
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:08,428
What made you want to do it today?

6
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,700
I just thought we should get away.

7
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:15,700
Well, you made my day.

8
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:23,515
I know things have been a little bumpy
with us lately.

9
00:01:26,755 --> 00:01:27,805
Brett?

10
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,658
I'm sorry. What'd you say?

11
00:01:44,948 --> 00:01:47,528
What's going on? What are they doing?

12
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:56,553
Brett?

13
00:01:56,686 --> 00:01:58,800
I know. Hang on.

14
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,700
Get down.

15
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:06,700
Get down!

16
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,100
What the hell was that?

17
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,200
Oh my God, your shoulder!

18
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:39,668
You've been shot.

19
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:46,192
Who are those guys?

20
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,900
What are you doing?

21
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:55,800
We're way past framing him now, sir.

22
00:03:58,573 --> 00:03:59,661
So?

23
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,240
Change of plans.

24
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:02,600
No more snatch and grab?

25
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:06,051
Guy wanted for killing an assistant D.A.

26
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:09,000
runs off with his girl...
How does that make him look?

27
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:10,320
Desperate.

28
00:04:10,743 --> 00:04:11,850
Guilty as sin.

29
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:16,100
You know, desperate people,
capable of anything,

30
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:17,600
even murder.

31
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:19,000
Murder-suicide...

32
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:21,400
My specialty.

33
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,188
You ever wonder why they picked him?

34
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,491
If I were you,

35
00:04:27,148 --> 00:04:28,300
I wouldn't ask.

36
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,446
I don't understand. Who were those guys?

37
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:37,320
- What did they want from us?
- I don't know.

38
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,737
- Brett, you must go to a hospital.
- No.

39
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,790
No hospitals, no cops.

40
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,907
But those guys just tried to kill us.

41
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,421
And we need to get
as far away from here as possible.

42
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,309
- You're a cop! Call for backup!
- I can't do that.

43
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:54,957
Why?

44
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,659
'cause the last time I was
in the system,

45
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:58,750
I got snatched out of county jail
and ended up...

46
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:00,150
What are you talking about?

47
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,040
I can't tell you.
It won't make any sense.

48
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,015
- You are bleeding out.
- Rita, please!

49
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,214
We're gonna find a store,
you're gonna get supplies

50
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:19,550
and you're gonna patch me up.

51
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,750
Please.

52
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,550
Okay, stay calm.

53
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:37,550
You can do this, all right?

54
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:39,250
Just go in there, get what you need.

55
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,584
and I promise you,
I will explain everything...

56
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,250
Everything to you as soon as I get you
someplace safe.

57
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:49,287
Okay?

58
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:16,650
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, it's me.<i>

59
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,229
- Hopper, I can't talk right now.
- Just listen. I'm being framed

60
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:21,711
for Garza's murder.

61
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,350
- What?
<i>- Two detectives,</i>

62
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,962
Spivak and Choi
are gonna try and flip you

63
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,294
<i>against me, all right?</i>

64
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:29,902
They're gonna promise to get
Internal Affairs off your back.

65
00:06:30,146 --> 00:06:31,200
Don't believe them.

66
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:34,150
All right, Andrea? Please.
Just... we're partners.

67
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,450
<i>I'm sorry.</i> I can't do this right now.
I'm heading into I.A.

68
00:06:41,154 --> 00:06:43,450
- I'll call you later.
<i>- Wait, wait. Andrea...</i>

69
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,350
The... Andrea?

70
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,036
Excuse me, ma'am.

71
00:06:59,477 --> 00:07:00,550
Yes, officer?

72
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:01,811
Is everything all right?

73
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:06,934
Oh, my goodness.

74
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:08,136
Right...

75
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,809
I'm an E.R. Nurse, and there was...

76
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,325
A dog?

77
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,993
So what did you do with it?

78
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,799
Did you put it in your car?

79
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:25,166
I didn't want to move him.

80
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,971
He's back up on the highway.

81
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,706
I'll call animal control.

82
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:35,350
They're used to handling these things.

83
00:07:35,397 --> 00:07:38,050
- You know what? That's okay...
- Get on the ground!

84
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,650
Get down on the ground.

85
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,850
Come on.

86
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:50,318
I had it. Five more seconds,

87
00:07:50,384 --> 00:07:52,801
- and we were out of here.
- He was a county sheriff, Rita.

88
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:54,494
Do you know what he sees on these roads?

89
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:57,181
And with all that blood on you, he was
never gonna let you go.

90
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:59,269
You were scared I was gonna tell him
what really happened?

91
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:01,457
No! I'm just trying
to get you out of trouble.

92
00:08:09,217 --> 00:08:11,647
Look, I don't know what's going on,

93
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,732
but if we are to get through
whatever is happening,

94
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,447
- you are gonna have to trust me.
- This isn't about trust.

95
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:18,920
It's about keeping us alive.

96
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,831
- Where have you been?
- I had to hide the truck.

97
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:30,989
Once you patch me up,
we can get outta here.

98
00:08:31,073 --> 00:08:32,359
And go where?

99
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,974
Once again,
who were those men on the road

100
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,487
- and why aren't we calling the cops?
- It's complicated.

101
00:08:38,947 --> 00:08:39,951
Try me.

102
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,800
All right, short version...
I've been set up for murder.

103
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:53,407
An assistant D.A. was killed last night,

104
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:55,850
And I think some cops
are trying to frame me for it.

105
00:08:58,695 --> 00:08:59,750
Sit down.

106
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:09,250
Okay, we need to sterilize it.
This is gonna hurt.

107
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:10,650
More than getting shot?

108
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:21,532
The bullet's still in there.
You need a surgeon.

109
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:23,546
- You have to do it yourself.
- Brett, I can't.

110
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:26,293
- Yeah, you can. You've seen it done.
- Yeah, at a hospital.

111
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,282
But look where we are. I don't have
the tools to extract a bullet.

112
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,450
All right. Now you do.

113
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:41,309
A year in Vice,
a year in the Hate Crime unit.

114
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,056
Last 2 years, narcotics working
a 3-men buy team?

115
00:09:44,178 --> 00:09:46,861
- That's right.
- Rough trade, narcotics.

116
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:48,768
With all the scum you gotta deal with

117
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:50,980
junkies, crack whores...
it would make me sick.

118
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,103
I don't know. I've found there's scum
in every line of work.

119
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,402
Yeah, but the trick
is you can't let it get you dirty,

120
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,231
'cause that's what brings you into
our loving arms here in I.A.

121
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,850
- You worried about what I got in here?
- Why would I be?

122
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:06,587
'Cause it's gonna cost you your career.

123
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,668
We've been watching you...

124
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:12,079
for weeks.

125
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,850
What?

126
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:37,515
Your lucky day, Battle.

127
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:39,532
Two guys from robbery homicide
wanna talk to you.

128
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,650
Spivak and Choi.

129
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:42,350
It's about Hopper.

130
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:47,403
It's definitely not fun
being under the I.A. microscope.

131
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:49,450
- We've all been there.
- Yeah, those guys think:

132
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,585
"I pulled all this crap
when I was on the streets

133
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,450
so they must be doing it, too."

134
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,480
Wait a minute.

135
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,351
You gotta watch that Shelton
in particular. He's a real crusader.

136
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,558
Nutty bar?

137
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,322
I have to say right out front,

138
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:23,750
I think you guys are both wrong
about Hopper.

139
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,815
Well, we respect your loyalty,
but we got him cold.

140
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,701
Gun, prints.

141
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,606
Wait, you've got Hopper's prints
on the murder weapon?

142
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,050
It's a done deal.

143
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:35,658
D.A.'s office is going to miss Garza.

144
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,928
Guy never shied away
from the tough ones.

145
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:43,008
One to the head, two the chest,

146
00:11:43,206 --> 00:11:45,650
- execution style.
- Cop style.

147
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:48,346
Just like they teach you at the academy.

148
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:51,674
We want you to listen to something,
maybe shed some light on it for us.

149
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,615
<i>Hopper, you should've received
a package today.</i>

150
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,850
<i>It's important.
Don't let anyone know you have it.</i>

151
00:11:56,946 --> 00:11:58,150
<i>You'll be contacted soon.</i>

152
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,496
Who is that?

153
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:02,450
What package is she talking about?

154
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,793
I don't know.

155
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,893
Think it has something to do
with Garza's murder?

156
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,646
You know homicide always supersedes
internal investigations.

157
00:12:16,107 --> 00:12:17,749
You cooperate with us here,

158
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,243
we'll make this whole
Chad Shelton I.A. thing go away.

159
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:26,609
When was the last time
you spoke to Hopper?

160
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,250
Yesterday.

161
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:36,262
Here we go. Hold on to something.

162
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:46,850
I'm sorry. It's lodged deep in there.

163
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:49,150
You're lucky it didn't hit
a major artery.

164
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,493
I know there's a lot
you're not telling me.

165
00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:57,538
And although I should be used to it
'cause I know that's your deal,

166
00:12:57,604 --> 00:12:59,250
it just sucks at a time like this.

167
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,050
Could we not do this right now, please?

168
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:02,122
We need help, Brett.

169
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:04,119
There must be somebody you trust.

170
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:05,406
Yeah, you.

171
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:06,721
What about Andrea?

172
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,646
- She's not part of this?
- I don't know.

173
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,850
Anybody's capable of anything.

174
00:13:14,823 --> 00:13:16,850
Did you get it? Did you get it?

175
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:19,101
Sorry. We're gonna have to try it again.

176
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,032
You wanted to know
who Miss Battle was talking to

177
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:27,977
before she came in.

178
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:30,866
Let me guess.
Her sleazy little friend Slim.

179
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,072
It's a cell phone registered
to a Rita Shelton.

180
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:39,452
I'm sure it's not your ex.

181
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:46,140
I wanna believe everything you said,
Brett,

182
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:47,859
but there's something
I don't understand.

183
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:50,221
If this Garza guy was murdered
last night

184
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:52,454
and this investigation
took place overnight,

185
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:54,284
how could you know about it?

186
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:56,930
You were with me the whole time.

187
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,696
Okay, this is gonna sound
like it's impossible.

188
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,046
But I need you to believe me.

189
00:14:13,972 --> 00:14:16,350
These past three days, I've woken up...

190
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,250
And it's the same day.

191
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:22,306
It's the same time, it's the same place,

192
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:24,650
it's the same damn traffic report.

193
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,450
I am living today

194
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,050
over and over again.

195
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,750
What are you talking about?

196
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:38,946
There's this guy in a rock quarry,

197
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:42,050
And he knows everything about you, me,

198
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,650
Jen and the kids.

199
00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:46,787
And he wants me
to confess to killing Garza.

200
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,451
All right, and those guys...
Those guys on the road...

201
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:51,928
They work for him, and they caught me,

202
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:55,480
and they stuck me
with this big-ass needle twice.

203
00:14:57,317 --> 00:14:58,856
And ever since...

204
00:15:05,257 --> 00:15:06,192
Andrea took that call

205
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,253
not 10 minutes before
you swiped her away from me.

206
00:15:08,297 --> 00:15:11,021
So detective Battle
talked to your ex-wife. Big deal.

207
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:13,695
Not my ex-wife. My ex-wife's boyfriend.

208
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,011
I think you're in shock.

209
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:19,596
I think you've lost...

210
00:15:20,324 --> 00:15:22,459
- a lot of blood.
- I'm not in shock.

211
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:25,250
This is really happening to me.

212
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:26,475
Okay? I can prove it.

213
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:28,950
There's a truck accident today...

214
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,915
Spilled baby diapers.

215
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,581
And the papers, all right?
Check the papers.

216
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,350
The headlines are all about Garza.

217
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,539
Oh, the Dodgers! The Dodgers win today.

218
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,975
Okay? It's the same game.
It's the same day.

219
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:44,829
So what you're saying is that we've...

220
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:47,165
- We've been at this motel before.
- Yes. No.

221
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:49,415
- But you've been shot before.
- No.

222
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,519
- But they've come after me.
- Have we had this conversation before?

223
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,384
- I don't understand.
- I don't understand either...

224
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,077
The day is the same,

225
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:01,775
all right?

226
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,205
But different things happen.

227
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:09,357
It depends.
Like... this lady at the coffee shop,

228
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:11,628
One day I save her, next day...

229
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,450
She gets hit by a bus

230
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:15,207
because I wasn't there.

231
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,033
You don't see?

232
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,158
You don't see.

233
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,587
Yeah.

234
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:31,938
Hopper, where are you?

235
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,415
Andrea... they came to you, didn't they?

236
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:37,639
Spivak and Choi,
just like I said they would?

237
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:39,150
Look, Hopper, I want to help you.

238
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,296
But I can't unless you tell me
where you are.

239
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:45,050
You have to trust me.

240
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:48,350
<i>You cut a deal with I.A.
to bring me in, yes or no?</i>

241
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:49,750
<i>I'm not proud of it, okay?</i>

242
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:51,650
I'm sorry, Andrea. I can't.

243
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,550
So he is with her.

244
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:01,937
You got a fix on that phone?

245
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,950
I've been thinking...

246
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,250
You said something about needles.

247
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,578
What if someone had given you
an hallucinogen?

248
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,315
So none of this is happening?

249
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,915
No, no. That's not what I'm saying.

250
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,852
I mean how could this have happened
last night

251
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:28,265
if you were with me the whole time?

252
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,550
It had to have happened yesterday
or a few days ago.

253
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,596
It was yesterday. Yesterday was today.

254
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,550
Yesterday <i>is</i>... today.

255
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:41,015
Have you been having headaches?

256
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,268
Because maybe... you've hit your head.

257
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,413
- Or maybe you just had a stroke.
- Don't you think

258
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,348
I've thought about this like a million
times? Looked for explanations?

259
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,850
Maybe I need an M.R.I!
Maybe I need a shrink!

260
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:53,179
Maybe I stepped on a damn time machine!

261
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:54,550
I don't know!

262
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:05,790
Okay.

263
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:08,680
I don't understand

264
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,350
how this is happening to me.

265
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,050
I don't know who's doing it.

266
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,920
I don't know how to make it stop.
I don't know why.

267
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:18,552
And right now, I don't care.

268
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,458
The only thing I care about right now

269
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:24,550
is making sure that you're...

270
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:31,450
What?

271
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:33,250
What is it?

272
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,950
You keep saying
this is about keeping me safe.

273
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,534
If you're saying
you've lived this day before,

274
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:45,257
what happens to me, Brett?

275
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,786
Nothing. Nothing.

276
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,849
We're fine. We're together.

277
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,808
You're lying.

278
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,201
Those guys that ambushed us
on the road...

279
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:58,150
You think something happens to me.

280
00:19:07,098 --> 00:19:08,750
Listen to me. Listen to me.

281
00:19:10,804 --> 00:19:12,774
Nothing is going to happen to you.

282
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,184
All we have to do is make sure
we don't get caught.

283
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:46,855
Great. We'll be there in 20.

284
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,002
Local county sheriffs
are good for backup.

285
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:52,832
They'll meet us there, secure the roads,

286
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:54,446
hang back till we say go.

287
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,012
I still think we should've brought
S.W.A.T.

288
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,649
You're doing the right thing, you know.

289
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,750
<i>...and the final score is in.
Just moments ago,</i>

290
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:18,696
<i>the Dodgers capped
an amazing 7-run rally</i>

291
00:20:18,743 --> 00:20:20,664
<i>in the ninth inning to beat the Giants.</i>

292
00:20:20,814 --> 00:20:24,345
<i>Highlights coming up in sports.
We're also gonna take a look at...</i>

293
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:30,712
I'm sorry...

294
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,577
About your dress.

295
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,705
It's okay.

296
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,322
I coulda sold that cop
back at the store.

297
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,943
I did try to save a stray once.

298
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,650
He was hit on the highway...
This poor, scruffy mutt, bleeding.

299
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:54,199
I was with Chad on our way to Vegas

300
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,868
for our honeymoon.

301
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:59,227
Anyway, I had him pull over.

302
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:02,450
I could tell he was all broken inside.

303
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,331
Chad didn't want him in the car.

304
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,350
And he said we should just leave him,

305
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,150
let him die naturally.

306
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,186
So we did.

307
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:27,650
I've washed blood off my hands before,

308
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,050
but never yours.

309
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:33,050
Get in the bathroom.

310
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,350
She's inside.

311
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,702
How'd you find me?

312
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:53,450
Give me some credit. I'm a cop.

313
00:21:55,176 --> 00:21:56,576
What's wrong with your shoulder?

314
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,550
He was shot.

315
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:01,532
- Rita, you okay?
- Yeah, it's him I'm worried about.

316
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:02,799
Did you come alone?

317
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,050
Yeah, of course.

318
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,972
Look, I know the trouble
you're in, Hopper.

319
00:22:15,263 --> 00:22:16,445
And I want to help.

320
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:18,819
But you have to be straight with me.

321
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:20,850
Tell me what happened with Garza.

322
00:22:21,863 --> 00:22:23,468
Nothing happened with Garza.

323
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,515
I don't know the guy.

324
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,675
You know me better than that, Andrea.

325
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:30,491
Then that's what you tell 'em
when you turn <i>yourself in.</i>

326
00:22:30,591 --> 00:22:33,050
<i>Forget about it.
I'm not going to jail.</i>

327
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,150
I didn't kill Garza.

328
00:22:36,492 --> 00:22:37,561
So what are you gonna do?

329
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:40,749
Whatever it takes.

330
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,456
Okay, Hopper, just calm down.

331
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,161
All right? We can fix this.

332
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:47,950
Just don't do anything drastic.

333
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,712
She's got 2 more minutes
to do something,

334
00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:56,701
then we're going in.

335
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:07,140
Who are these guys?

336
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,466
How did they get past the checkpoint?

337
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:13,650
I said no cars in or out
until we're clear.

338
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,115
Call your men and make sure
they secure the road.

339
00:23:28,357 --> 00:23:29,650
Something's not right.

340
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:40,950
Get the vests.

341
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:54,950
Listen.

342
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:56,950
What's wrong?

343
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,177
They found us.

344
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,840
Hopper. We're clear.

345
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,550
New plan.

346
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:17,350
Put the weapon down.

347
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,702
- You guys run to the car.
- I'll cover you.

348
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,850
- We can't leave you.
- I've got back up. You don't.

349
00:25:49,904 --> 00:25:52,376
- Andrea, I can't let you do that.
- Just shut up and listen.

350
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,215
They've got a gun
with your prints on it.

351
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,519
They played me some voice mail.

352
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,139
A woman talking about some package
they sent to you.

353
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:00,707
They think it's about Garza.

354
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,668
<i>Hopper, you should've received
a package today.</i>

355
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:03,708
<i>It's important.</i>

356
00:26:08,763 --> 00:26:10,050
On three. You ready?

357
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:14,850
One...

358
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:19,174
Two...

359
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:20,670
Go!

360
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,112
Hopper!

361
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,450
Go.

362
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,650
You were gonna meet my mom today.

363
00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:47,920
It's gonna be okay.

364
00:27:49,498 --> 00:27:51,250
Just gotta keep going.

365
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:32,102
It's gonna be all right.

366
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,533
Just gotta keep going.

367
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:38,050
It's gonna be a new day.

368
00:28:38,588 --> 00:28:40,024
It's gonna be a new day.

369
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,550
I just gotta keep going.

370
00:29:27,354 --> 00:29:28,450
Brett.

371
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,830
Oh my God.

372
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,615
<i>Dr. Artlet, I.C.U.</i>

373
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:53,790
<i>Dr. Miller, 5-7-2-3.</i>

374
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:55,811
Jen.

375
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,766
- Brett, it's okay.
- Where's Rita?

376
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:01,613
Where's Rita? Is she okay?

377
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,850
Yeah. She's just talking to the doctors.

378
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:05,471
Lie back.

379
00:30:05,608 --> 00:30:07,000
Take it easy.

380
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:14,555
<i>Hopper!</i>

381
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:16,350
Andrea got shot.

382
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:20,191
Slow down.
You lost a lot of blood last night.

383
00:30:20,476 --> 00:30:22,466
What happened to you?
They say you took a bullet.

384
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:24,563
We got ambushed by these guys and...

385
00:30:24,694 --> 00:30:26,452
Rita didn't tell you? She was there.

386
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,068
We...

387
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:36,403
<i>don't worry. Your sister
and the kids are okay.</i>

388
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:38,179
Jen, come on. You gotta get outta here.

389
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,678
- It's not safe. It's not safe. Go.
- Relax.

390
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,985
It's okay. Go. Go.

391
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:44,450
You are all right, okay?
You're all right.

392
00:30:45,673 --> 00:30:47,839
<i>Relax. It's just a mild sedative.</i>

393
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:50,215
<i>We'd like you to sleep on it.</i>

394
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,137
No, no needles. It's just a sedative.

395
00:30:53,094 --> 00:30:54,736
No, relax. It's okay.

396
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:56,650
- You are all right.
- This is impossible.

397
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,415
They never gave me the shot.

398
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,550
I never... they never caught us.

399
00:31:01,845 --> 00:31:02,850
Detective Brett Hopper.

400
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,413
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza...

401
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:08,197
You two, out.

402
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:09,748
Now.

403
00:31:12,882 --> 00:31:14,637
Well, since you asked so nicely.

404
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,050
We'll have an officer on the door.

405
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,550
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

406
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,750
I'll be back.

407
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,450
I told you two he wasn't ready
to be moved.

408
00:31:36,513 --> 00:31:39,072
He seems fine to us. We've called
an ambulance to transport him.

409
00:31:39,073 --> 00:31:40,250
Until you get one, he's ours.

410
00:31:40,285 --> 00:31:41,604
How can you treat one of your own

411
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,071
like he's some common criminal?
Our father was a cop.

412
00:31:44,127 --> 00:31:46,783
Ladies, please.
We're just trying to do our jobs.

413
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:49,909
Ms. Shelton, you were
with detective Hopper last night.

414
00:31:49,956 --> 00:31:51,302
- Is that correct?
- Yes, I was.

415
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,073
So you can provide him with an alibi

416
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:54,871
- for the entire night?
- Absolutely.

417
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,152
So how did he get that bullet wound?

418
00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:05,174
Yeah, I thought so. Let's get
an E.T.A. on that ambulance.

419
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,850
We should talk to his partner, Battle.

420
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:13,027
You worried about what's in here?

421
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:14,163
Why would I be?

422
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,846
'Cause it's gonna cost you your career.

423
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:21,058
We've been watching you...

424
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,450
for weeks.

425
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,740
Danny Yan.

426
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:27,850
The guys at vice call him "Slim."

427
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,850
Runs a gentlemen's club
over in Chinatown.

428
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,077
You've done a lot of business with him.

429
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:34,096
He's a confidential informant.

430
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,402
He's a drug dealer,

431
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:36,367
human garbage.

432
00:32:36,449 --> 00:32:38,833
Who helps us bring down
bigger pieces of garbage.

433
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,054
Really?

434
00:32:40,746 --> 00:32:42,075
Where exactly are these hitters?

435
00:32:42,098 --> 00:32:43,766
They're not on your list
of last arrests.

436
00:32:43,806 --> 00:32:45,919
Not every tip leads
to a Colombian cartel.

437
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:50,800
Well, tell me, how exactly
are you paying Mr. Yan

438
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,515
for these juicy little nuggets?

439
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,178
'Cause there's no official list
of any C.I. payouts to him

440
00:32:55,217 --> 00:32:56,449
in the last couple of months.

441
00:32:58,850 --> 00:32:59,950
I haven't filed them yet.

442
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,809
I find it interesting
that before every meeting

443
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,331
with this confidential informant

444
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:20,699
you make a withdrawal...

445
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,050
From your personal account.

446
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,287
$1,000 here, $2,000 there.

447
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,682
Tell me something,
you seen Eddie lately?

448
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,365
What?

449
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:15,903
What?

450
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:17,326
Hopper's been shot.

451
00:34:17,827 --> 00:34:18,895
He's at the hospital.

452
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:22,217
They're saying he killed Garza.
Took a bullet in the process.

453
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,177
- You think Hopper...
- No.

454
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,026
You?

455
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:36,103
Anybody's capable of anything.

456
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,150
I need to know what happened to you.

457
00:34:40,383 --> 00:34:42,405
We went to bed last night
and everything was fine.

458
00:34:42,424 --> 00:34:44,235
Then I wake up
and you're covered in blood

459
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:45,814
with a gaping hole in your shoulder.

460
00:34:46,276 --> 00:34:47,174
I mean, my God, Brett,

461
00:34:47,193 --> 00:34:48,753
it looked like somebody butchered you.

462
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,722
It's complicated.

463
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,550
Try me.

464
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:58,363
I thought I knew how to fix this day,
but I can't.

465
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,575
It's bigger than I thought.

466
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,150
I don't understand.

467
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,415
All you need to know

468
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,515
is that I am being framed for murder,

469
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,550
and I need your help.

470
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,149
You gotta trust me.

471
00:35:12,226 --> 00:35:14,634
This isn't about trust.
This is life and death.

472
00:35:14,673 --> 00:35:15,877
I almost lost you today.

473
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:17,861
Do you have any idea how that feels?

474
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,715
Do you believe me
when I say that I did not do this?

475
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,260
Yes.

476
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:30,043
Well, help me.

477
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:35,571
Help me get outta here
so I can figure out who did.

478
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,230
I'm sorry, honey.

479
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:41,497
Maybe you could just whip up
some pasta for the kids tonight

480
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,950
or take them out.

481
00:35:43,546 --> 00:35:45,548
Randall, don't get angry.
It's my brother.

482
00:35:45,606 --> 00:35:46,684
He's in bad shape.

483
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,934
They're saying
that he can't even be moved.

484
00:35:48,992 --> 00:35:49,974
Code blue.

485
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,350
Brett!

486
00:35:57,796 --> 00:35:59,603
- Why aren't you in there?
- He was crashing.

487
00:35:59,642 --> 00:36:01,607
Nurses kicked me out
when the alarms went off.

488
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:09,847
Son of a bitch!

489
00:36:12,389 --> 00:36:13,545
How many men do we have?

490
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:15,447
<i>Three units on site,
four more on the way.</i>

491
00:36:15,471 --> 00:36:17,670
If his girlfriend's with him,
I'll bring her in, too.

492
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,045
- I'll take the back.
- I'll meet security in the lobby.

493
00:36:26,981 --> 00:36:28,676
<i>We have units on the front and rear.</i>

494
00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:30,084
No, I said every exit.

495
00:36:30,142 --> 00:36:31,768
He does not leave this hospital.

496
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,060
<i>You dropped this.</i>

497
00:36:44,528 --> 00:36:45,914
I gotta be better about that.

498
00:36:46,249 --> 00:36:47,867
- You know this woman?
- Not exactly.

499
00:36:57,493 --> 00:36:58,919
I need your keys.

500
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:02,050
Up you go. Come on.

501
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:06,876
You can't run forever, Hopper.

502
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,312
I don't plan to.

503
00:37:09,323 --> 00:37:11,233
Then why make it hard? Turn yourself in.

504
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,457
To you guys?

505
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,150
For all I know, you planted
that gun in my closet.

506
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:20,090
Who said anything about
a gun in your closet?

507
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,489
Come on! Let's go!

508
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,250
Go! Go!

509
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,985
As soon as they find Choi, they're gonna
change frequencies, but until then...

510
00:37:43,268 --> 00:37:43,950
we can listen in.

511
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,652
What is that?

512
00:37:47,872 --> 00:37:50,718
Well, let's hope Choi records
all of his case notes,

513
00:37:51,076 --> 00:37:53,208
like a good little homicide detective.

514
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,485
<i>Need to find this Damien,
see where he fits.</i>

515
00:37:56,589 --> 00:37:58,499
<i>Next message tied to him or Garza?</i>

516
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,708
<i>Hopper, you should've received
a package today.</i>

517
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,450
<i>They played me a voice mail.</i>

518
00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:05,800
<i>A woman talking about
some package they sent to you.</i>

519
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:07,951
<i>they think it's something to do
with Garza.</i>

520
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,821
I gotta go to my place.

521
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,393
What if we just drive, right now?

522
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,264
What if we just run?

523
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,178
We can't. Won't solve anything.

524
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,040
You woke up in a pool of blood
this morning,

525
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,274
and you can't tell me how
and you can't tell me why.

526
00:38:33,547 --> 00:38:35,630
I'm just trying to understand
what we're doing.

527
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,173
I gotta find out who killed Garza
and why they're framing me for it.

528
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:42,245
And the first step to finding
some of those answers

529
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,115
might be right there in that mailbox.

530
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,815
What do you plan to do?

531
00:38:45,854 --> 00:38:48,422
I'm gonna stake my place out,
make sure that cop's alone,

532
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,757
then I'll figure something out.

533
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,150
So this is what it's like.

534
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:04,247
- This is what's like?
- A stakeout.

535
00:39:06,108 --> 00:39:07,950
You've been on stakeouts with me before.

536
00:39:07,985 --> 00:39:09,050
What? When?

537
00:39:09,201 --> 00:39:11,071
Koko's Manchurian barbecue.

538
00:39:11,112 --> 00:39:13,295
Koko's? No. That was our first date.

539
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,925
That was a stakeout?

540
00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:18,380
Wait, no. I...

541
00:39:18,421 --> 00:39:19,422
Wait.

542
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:21,815
I... Okay.

543
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:23,031
I had no choice.

544
00:39:23,142 --> 00:39:26,586
We were both doing that
"are we more than friends" thing, and...

545
00:39:26,677 --> 00:39:27,870
And... I wanted to be,

546
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:30,650
but I knew that
if I canceled on you again,

547
00:39:30,685 --> 00:39:33,172
then you'd... That I'd lose you, so...

548
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,611
Yeah, you probably would have.

549
00:39:38,611 --> 00:39:39,612
Right.

550
00:39:47,377 --> 00:39:49,490
I can get the cop away
from the building.

551
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:20,515
What'd you do?

552
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,008
Don't ask. You get the package?

553
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:23,668
No. The cops must have taken my mail.

554
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:25,965
- I'll get here earlier tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

555
00:40:28,618 --> 00:40:29,629
What do you mean?

556
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:34,554
- Hello.
<i>- Rita, are you nuts?</i>

557
00:40:34,585 --> 00:40:36,677
<i>- Aiding and abetting a fugitive?</i>
- Who is it?

558
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,588
- Chad...
<i>- Rita? Rita!</i>

559
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:40,718
- What are you doing?
- He's in a room full of cops

560
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:42,969
tracking your phone.
Come on. We gotta go.

561
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:57,321
What's going on?

562
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,381
Yeah, hey, man. How's it going?

563
00:40:59,532 --> 00:41:01,781
You know, same old, same old.
