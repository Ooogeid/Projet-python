2
00:00:07,386 --> 00:00:09,409
<i>My name is Detective Brett Hopper.</i>

3
00:00:10,174 --> 00:00:12,470
<i>And this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

4
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:13,978
Put your hands up!

5
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:16,706
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza

6
00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:18,340
<i>I will be framed for murder.</i>

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,887
Who the hell are you people?

8
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:23,402
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

9
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:26,565
<i>I know all this
because I'm living the same day...</i>

10
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:28,820
<i>... over and over again.</i>

11
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:31,792
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

12
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:33,378
<i>Every day, I get another chance.</i>

13
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:35,824
For every decision,
there's a consequence.

14
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:37,752
<i>Somehow this old murder case is the key.</i>

15
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:40,553
<i>Turns out my sister Jennifer had
the missing piece of evidence.</i>

16
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,948
Autopsy report.

17
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:44,653
- When she died, she was pregnant.
- Isn't this Dad's handwriting?

18
00:00:44,654 --> 00:00:46,226
Who's Tobias Booth?

19
00:00:46,408 --> 00:00:48,814
I don't know why Garza's widow
was telling lies about me.

20
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:52,121
Brett Hopper couldn't have killed
your husband, he was with me all night.

21
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:53,802
I saw his face.

22
00:00:53,898 --> 00:00:56,331
<i>But I think I finally know
who's pulling the strings.</i>

23
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:00,376
As Alberto Garza used to say,
hope is bigger than anyone of us.

24
00:01:00,954 --> 00:01:02,293
You cannot kill hope...

25
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:03,879
with a bullet.

26
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,120
<i>Now, I need to find out why.</i>

27
00:01:57,094 --> 00:01:58,914
Someone should call Mrs. Garza
at the club,

28
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:00,897
tell her she can go home if she wants.

29
00:02:00,993 --> 00:02:03,087
I'm taking she wanna be
anywhere but here.

30
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:07,630
How are we coming
on the arrest warrant for Hopper?

31
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:09,482
Just signed out based on Mrs. Garza ID.

32
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:12,462
As soon as we get the paper work,
we can knock on Hopper's door.

33
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,184
Nothing worse than a cop going wrong.

34
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,057
Makes us all look bad.

35
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:17,629
Easy, Tiger, we'll get him.

36
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:21,743
Should have it open any minute.

37
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:24,011
You think Garza had any secrets?

38
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:26,553
Everyone's got secret.

39
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:47,820
Morning!

40
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:54,198
Brett, your phone.

41
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:01,278
It's Jennifer. Do you want me to get it?

42
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:02,317
Thanks.

43
00:03:05,105 --> 00:03:06,144
Is everything OK?

44
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:15,197
They threatened me.

45
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,251
That's how they hurt Randall,
the kids...

46
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:19,502
I know they were after Dad's briefcase.

47
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:21,744
There's a document hidden
inside the lining.

48
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:23,615
A document?
How could you possibly know that?

49
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:25,618
Because these same men are after me.

50
00:03:25,714 --> 00:03:27,915
They're trying to frame me for murder.

51
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:29,883
Murder?

52
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:32,405
- You have to tell someone.
- Listen.

53
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:33,745
We are gonna handle this.

54
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,725
We're gonna take care of it ourselves.

55
00:03:35,726 --> 00:03:38,254
I'm gonna help you.
You gotta call this number.

56
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:39,799
Take the briefcase to them.

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,488
Ask for Fencik or Buchalter.

58
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:44,193
- Alright, you got those names?
- Who are these people?

59
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:45,930
They're ex-cops,
they're just muscle now,

60
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:48,353
- I've been tracing them.
- It doesn't make any sense.

61
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:49,894
Alright, listen, just pair with me.

62
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:51,042
You got that photo?

63
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:58,008
Who is she?

64
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,168
This is Isabella Contreras.

65
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:03,687
Somehow, everything was
back to her being murdered

66
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:05,941
and them trying to cover it up.

67
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,466
Do you know who killed her?

68
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:08,478
Not yet.

69
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,611
But I know who has my vote.

70
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:13,002
Thank you.

71
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:17,369
This hope center

72
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,225
was the dream of Alberto Garza.

73
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:22,877
A great believer
in the people of the city...

74
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:24,503
So here's the guy in the monkey suit.

75
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:25,679
Tobias Booth.

76
00:04:26,294 --> 00:04:27,332
City councilman.

77
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:30,298
Friend of the common man,
pillar of the community.

78
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:32,493
Why doesn't it sound like compliments?

79
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:34,570
Because he's a liar,
a thug and a killer.

80
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:37,686
...city of Los Angeles,
Alberto tirelessly paid...

81
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:38,725
<i>Burn it all down.</i>

82
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,076
<i>The cop who lost the book,</i>

83
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:43,884
<i>the gang leader,</i>

84
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,747
<i>the girl,</i>

85
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:49,959
<i>kill them all.</i>

86
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:53,095
<i>...but in distant memory,
I'd like to...</i>

87
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,833
Is he behind the whole Garza thing
they're trying to pin on you?

88
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,750
There might be a bigger fish,
but so far, yeah,

89
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:59,462
all my evidence leads to Booth.

90
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:01,744
Have you ever heard the Santayana Club?

91
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:04,765
Yeah, bunch of rich old white guys,
try to act like rich old and white.

92
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:05,899
Yeah, back in 91,

93
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:09,440
they got this girl who who worked there
pregnant, Isabella Contreras.

94
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,857
When Booth found out about the baby,

95
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:13,197
he had Isabella killed.

96
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:17,308
Everything that's going down today
goes back to that murder.

97
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,364
But why now?

98
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:20,420
I mean, why after all this time?

99
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,511
I have to work it to find out.

100
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,671
... by the sound of the gun fire.

101
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:28,190
This is definitely better
than a day in I.A.

102
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:36,901
Not now!

103
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,236
- Got Andrea Battle in five minutes.
- No, you don't.

104
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:41,875
- She just cancelled.
- What?

105
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:44,233
You don't cancel I.A.
Let me talk to her.

106
00:05:44,315 --> 00:05:45,613
She... left a message.

107
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:48,250
Was she looking a work security
in Loserville?

108
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,534
I'll just get her on the phone for you.

109
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:53,062
I've got a better idea.

110
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,644
Go over Chinatown,
see her snitch Danny Yan.

111
00:05:57,068 --> 00:06:00,033
If Danny Yan's connected,
he's not gonna talk.

112
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:02,329
I'm closing this case today,
with or without Battle.

113
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,369
<i>Thank you.</i>

114
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:05,015
<i>And now,</i>

115
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,502
as proof of our resounding yes,

116
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:08,787
let me introduce

117
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:12,941
one of the greatest success stories
of our entire gang initiative:

118
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:18,142
Lewis Torrez joined the Latin Disciples
at the age of fourteen.

119
00:06:18,664 --> 00:06:21,959
Today, Lewis is a member
of my staff and a...

120
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,282
I wonder what he really does for Booth.

121
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:25,923
Why don't you ask him?

122
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:29,455
I haven't been able
to get close enough to him.

123
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:33,733
Besides, Booth isn't the type of guy
you wanna go toe to toe with.

124
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:37,963
You told me he's untouchable.
How are gonna get to him?

125
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,090
You cannot kill hope with a bullet.

126
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:47,860
I just did.

127
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,450
What did you do?

128
00:06:58,066 --> 00:06:59,077
Scared him.

129
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:00,379
Get Mrs. Garza.

130
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:02,275
Scared people make mistakes.

131
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:05,241
Yeah, we're gonna be right there
when he makes his.

132
00:07:10,782 --> 00:07:12,832
You saw your brother this morning?

133
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:18,295
You've already decided he did it.
Haven't you?

134
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,606
Anything he sent to you can help us
exonerate him.

135
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:22,945
My father was a cop.

136
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:24,618
Drop the act.

137
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:27,367
OK, why did your brother kill
Alberto Garza?

138
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:28,419
He didn't.

139
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:29,773
He's being framed

140
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:32,308
by the same men who are after me.

141
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:35,103
It's the truth.

142
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:38,861
About a week ago, two men approached me.

143
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:42,078
They said they wanted
some of my father's old things

144
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,896
and if I didn't give it to them,

145
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,671
they were gonna kill my husband
and my children.

146
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:49,384
Why didn't you go to the police?

147
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:50,874
Do you have kids?

148
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:56,839
I will do whatever I have to do
to keep my family safe

149
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,392
and these men made it very clear
what I could and couldn't do.

150
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,597
Any idea why you're set?

151
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:06,971
Because Brett is helping me.

152
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,467
Because he tracked them. He found out
their names : Fencik and Buchalter.

153
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:14,870
They're ex-cops and the same men
who are framing him.

154
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:18,123
A mess of conspiracy, how convenient.

155
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,075
Why don't you call them yourself?

156
00:08:40,615 --> 00:08:42,323
We should look into these guys.

157
00:08:42,324 --> 00:08:45,098
Don't tell me you believe her.
We got a positive ID from Mrs. Garza!

158
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:47,265
- It's just a phone call.
- She's Hopper's sister!

159
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:48,847
She tell us anything
to get him off the hook!

160
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:51,700
She wants him off the hook!

161
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:52,723
Fine.

162
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:56,129
And if you see any little green men,
tell 'em I said hi.

163
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,307
- Now I see why Booth's here.
- That's the grieving widow?

164
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:22,972
Don't let the costume fool you,
she's in on it.

165
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,858
Please! Step back. Excuse me...

166
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:27,225
Catch that photo op.

167
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,241
Protecting her the time I need.

168
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:36,834
You can't elaborate...

169
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:41,620
Who are you calling?

170
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:44,482
Someone who might know
Booth's gang banger friend.

171
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,035
Where you at, Hop?

172
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,222
Been trying to reach you
since last night!

173
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:55,778
I know about last night,
I'll get to the skinheads in a minute.

174
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:58,361
Skinheads? How do you know
about the skinheads?

175
00:09:58,362 --> 00:10:01,464
I just know, OK? I promise you
I'll take care of it. Listen to me.

176
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,891
I need some information
on a Latin Disciple,

177
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:05,829
an ex-gang banger named Torrez.

178
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,287
- This ain't about what you need!
- Come on, Damien!

179
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:10,708
- Help me!
- Sorry, Hop'.

180
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:12,417
I've got an empire to build.

181
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:18,555
- Problem with your CI?
- Yeah... I'll deal with him later.

182
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:20,156
We need to get in that house.

183
00:10:20,157 --> 00:10:21,164
Here's a plan.

184
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,143
Marching to the crime team
with public enemy number 1 ?

185
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:25,455
Could you handle that?

186
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:28,338
I forgot how much fun
it was being your partner.

187
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:53,926
We're closed.

188
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:56,427
Detective Choi, Robbery/Homicide.

189
00:10:57,317 --> 00:10:58,570
Looking for the owner.

190
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:00,963
- His name is Fenshik.
- That's Fencik.

191
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,550
- He ain't in.
- You know when he'll be back?

192
00:11:04,551 --> 00:11:05,573
No.

193
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:07,853
OK.

194
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:10,701
If you see him...

195
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,482
That's supposed to make yourself
more American?

196
00:11:21,836 --> 00:11:24,812
Tell Mr. Fencik he needs
to get in touch with me today.

197
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:27,408
I have some questions
I'd like to ask him.

198
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:42,051
There're pictures of you
and Andrea Battle all over Chinatown.

199
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,884
Photos of her giving you pay offs.

200
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:47,653
We know that's not CI money, so?

201
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:49,154
You're selling some drugs, or what?

202
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,589
You got it all wrong, Officer.

203
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:53,869
Sergent.

204
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:56,226
Sarge...

205
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:00,418
I'm just a small time entrepeneur...
friend of the force.

206
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,616
Yeah, small time.

207
00:12:02,393 --> 00:12:04,654
Clubs are major cover for drugs
and prostitution.

208
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,329
We know you answer
to the Kwai Long syndicate.

209
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,870
That sounds to me like you've been
watching too many Bruce Lee movies.

210
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,345
You know what I think ?

211
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:18,245
I think this is not about me at all.

212
00:12:19,591 --> 00:12:21,925
I think this is a beef
between you and...

213
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:24,052
Charlie's Angel.

214
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:27,831
But it ain't my fault
she got a junkie boyfriend

215
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,427
with bad credit
and a soft spot for strays.

216
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,473
Do you know where Battle is or not?

217
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:35,493
I can't tell you,

218
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:37,198
but if you see her,

219
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:38,760
send her my love.

220
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:43,022
Now if we're finished here,
I got a business to run.

221
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:51,039
You know, they go real nice
with a little rice and wasabi.

222
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:57,854
You go to the SPA. Do let me know
how things works up with Gar, yeah?

223
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:05,577
Keep walking around,
nothing to see here.

224
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:07,338
What's in the back?

225
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:09,275
I'll meet you, buddy.

226
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:11,781
My pitbull.

227
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:14,341
Oh, yeah? I love dogs.

228
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:15,882
What's his name?

229
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,354
Can I pet Baxter?

230
00:13:19,517 --> 00:13:22,534
No men, you know what, he's sick
but you can pet this if you like.

231
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,965
That's really neat.

232
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:25,878
I got one of those myself,

233
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,423
except mine came
with a really shiny badge.

234
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:01,664
Your safe, here.

235
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:03,809
I thought it was taken care of it.

236
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:04,947
It was.

237
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:08,246
I didn't know there was anything else.

238
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,508
Well, someone else clearly did.

239
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:12,476
Did you ever think to check the safe?

240
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,161
What are you doing in here ?

241
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:23,133
This is an active crime scene, sir.

242
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:24,836
And you two shouldn't be back here.

243
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:26,186
This is Mrs. Garza.

244
00:14:26,187 --> 00:14:27,954
I'm helping her to gather some things.

245
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:29,934
Right now,
you're tampering with evidence.

246
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,336
Now, I'd ask you to leave.

247
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,588
- What's your name?
- I don't see how that's relevant.

248
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:36,514
Your name...

249
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,952
Thank you for your diligence,
Detective Battle,

250
00:14:40,953 --> 00:14:43,313
I'll be sure to mention
it to your chief.

251
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:45,295
We're playing golf in the morning.

252
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,689
Give him my best.

253
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:03,301
Yeah, it's cool on tonight schedule.
Booth says we gotta move forward.

254
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,873
Can't wait anything the way it was.

255
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:08,176
At the summit.

256
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:09,899
Stand up slowly.

257
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,798
Step away from the door.

258
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:15,489
I'm a cop, I'm gonna show you my badge.

259
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:16,937
Alright?

260
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:20,343
Did you notice that this door was open?

261
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:21,547
- No, sir.
- Why not?

262
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:24,608
Did you check for signs of forced entry?

263
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:26,426
I got this ID over here right away.

264
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:27,670
Why don't you do that?

265
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:38,230
You're a dead man.

266
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:45,181
You can't make me go away
as easy as Isabella Contreras.

267
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:46,999
And before this day is done

268
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:50,430
everyone's gonna know
the truth about you.

269
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:53,604
Help!

270
00:15:53,891 --> 00:15:55,503
Over here! I need help!

271
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:07,306
This way! He's running this way!

272
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,258
There! That Hopper! He killed Garza.

273
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:14,362
Go back to garage, now.

274
00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:15,496
No more screw-ups.

275
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:23,869
Who is that?

276
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:50,212
Yeah, thanks for coming back to me,
Mr. Fencik.

277
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:51,976
Sure, when do you want to meet?

278
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,582
Where's that?

279
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:57,778
OK, I'll see you there.

280
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:27,904
What's up?

281
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,922
Torrez.

282
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,452
What's up?

283
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:46,998
<i>You're here, Hop'?</i>

284
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,310
Tell me, bro.

285
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:51,370
- Damien!
- Why the hell are you whispering?

286
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,282
Listen, I need some info
on Lewis Torrez.

287
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,250
He's pretty high up
in the pecking order.

288
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:57,867
He kicks it with the city councilman.

289
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,924
I could tell you a lot of things.
But I got problems on my own.

290
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,018
I got bagged.

291
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:04,854
<i>I need you to call them and tell them
I'm your CI. Get me out of here!</i>

292
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:05,962
What happened?

293
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:09,015
I was over in Chinatown and some cop
just decided to make photo of me.

294
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,926
- What were you doing in Chinatown?
- Well, what I do.

295
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:14,523
Me and my boys
went to a gentlemen's club.

296
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:15,945
Not the One Band.

297
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:18,562
I had a lucky guess
that you'd be following me.

298
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:21,403
I know that Slim runs the street joint
for the Kwai Long.

299
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:24,425
and I know the Kwai Long has been
in war with the Latin Disciple, so

300
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,858
why would you hang with them?

301
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:27,732
It's a help-help situation, Hop.

302
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:31,313
You want answers to your questions?
Get me out of here!

303
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,664
I'll be back after the summit.
This is good for all of us, <i>hermanos.</i>

304
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:06,703
See you, man.

305
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,924
You Choi?

306
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,316
Mr. Fencik.

307
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:42,104
Thanks for taking the time
to meet with me.

308
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:43,850
I just had a couple of questions
for you.

309
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:46,353
- What it's about?
- A homicide investigation.

310
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:47,642
Your name came up.

311
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:50,761
Really? How?

312
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,492
I'm just asking.

313
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:56,494
Your name comes up
in a murder investigation,

314
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,690
you're not gonna ask how?

315
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:58,742
I understand.

316
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:01,467
You know a man named Brett Hopper?

317
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,316
I can't say that I do.

318
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:09,359
Hey, can I get some more peanuts here?

319
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:14,098
Good service is hard to come by
these days.

320
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:15,138
Yeah.

321
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,663
- You hang on here regularly?
No.

322
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:22,692
I had some other business here tonight,
kinda fell appart at the last minute.

323
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,957
But what I do like about this place...

324
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,309
is they don't really care if we do this.

325
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,818
How about those peanuts?

326
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,688
I didn't want to wake you.

327
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:53,071
I wasn't sleeping.

328
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:04,324
- I didn't call you today, did I?
- No.

329
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:06,263
- You didn't.
- I'm sorry.

330
00:21:06,304 --> 00:21:08,996
Somewhat has been happening,
I thought you'd be safe with Chad.

331
00:21:08,997 --> 00:21:10,582
But then I didn't see his car.

332
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,513
- Why would Chad's car...
- Never mind...

333
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:16,572
I just had a lot of calls to make
and I know that you're pissed.

334
00:21:16,573 --> 00:21:18,872
You have every right to be.
I just...

335
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,466
I know, baby, I just forgot.

336
00:21:23,177 --> 00:21:24,202
And I'm sorry.

337
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:27,396
But you...

338
00:21:27,684 --> 00:21:29,635
You knew that I'd do this, right?

339
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:33,123
I would run and round all day
with Andrea trying to prove it.

340
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:34,130
Wait.

341
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:37,505
You had time to tell Andrea
you're wanted for murder?

342
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:40,099
Yeah, she's a cop. She can help.

343
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:41,832
But I can't?

344
00:21:42,406 --> 00:21:43,442
I didn't say that.

345
00:21:43,443 --> 00:21:45,082
Where have you been all day?

346
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,258
I got in a little trouble but...
it's not what we're talking about now.

347
00:21:49,313 --> 00:21:50,366
Really?

348
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:53,387
What is we're talking about right now?

349
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,043
Rita, I'm...

350
00:21:56,342 --> 00:21:57,350
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:57,351 --> 00:22:01,205
You know, one of the great things
about having someone to love, Brett...

352
00:22:01,206 --> 00:22:03,212
Is that you can tell them anything.

353
00:22:08,102 --> 00:22:09,852
I can't believe you just told me that!

354
00:22:09,853 --> 00:22:11,586
I thought I could tell you anything!

355
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:13,869
Yes, you can. But you can't say
"Hey, by the way

356
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,697
"I'll be falsely accused of murder
this morning. See you later honey".

357
00:22:20,232 --> 00:22:21,243
I got nothing.

358
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:25,140
Did you know about these charges
last night?

359
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:26,293
Yes... No!

360
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:29,356
It depends on what you mean
when you say 'last night'.

361
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:30,574
Last night last night.

362
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,501
Chinese food... Fooling around.

363
00:22:32,973 --> 00:22:34,558
But did you forget about that part too?

364
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,163
No! Of course not baby!

365
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:43,134
- Is this Andrea now?
- No.

366
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:45,547
She d... I'm gonna tell her right now.

367
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:48,117
Do a better job telling her
than you did me.

368
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,292
OK.

369
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:58,727
Uh... Yeah.

370
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,857
And now, as proof of our resounding yes,

371
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:04,874
Let me introduce
one of the greatest success stories

372
00:23:04,993 --> 00:23:06,842
of our anti gang initiative.

373
00:23:08,105 --> 00:23:09,130
Lewis Torrez.

374
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:10,427
Can't stay long.

375
00:23:10,428 --> 00:23:13,044
One deliver voice mail for Shelten
pushed back the IA meeting

376
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:15,149
But Sgt. Slaughter was at his desk.

377
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,033
He found himself at the top
of the gang pyramide.

378
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:23,294
He was prosecuted by Alberto Garza
3 years ago and sentenced to prison.

379
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:26,830
So Torrez is a liaison
between Booth and a Disciple.

380
00:23:26,868 --> 00:23:27,971
I thought he was reformed?

381
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:30,103
If he's reformed, I'm Dick Chenney.

382
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:34,715
Today, police is the key contributed
to the community...

383
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:36,973
Torrez runs guns
for the Latin Disciples.

384
00:23:36,974 --> 00:23:39,260
He's going to some summit
that's going down tonight.

385
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:40,307
What's it about?

386
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,421
I don't know.
I gotta go down to Chinatown

387
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:44,683
to check down my CI Damien.

388
00:23:45,014 --> 00:23:46,952
See if he can fill in any blanks.

389
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:50,480
Do you need me to drag Torres
down at the station

390
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,990
and get a location out of him?

391
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:55,827
Scary how you read my mind sometimes.

392
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,183
Come on.

393
00:24:11,475 --> 00:24:12,487
Excuse me.

394
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,069
It's your vehicule sir?

395
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,531
Huh, yeah.

396
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,712
- Anything stolen?
- I'm not sure.

397
00:24:19,237 --> 00:24:20,839
You should probably check out thoroughly

398
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,689
and report it,
it'll help with the insurance.

399
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,479
Thank you.
I'll do that later.

400
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:27,816
- There's no need to be hostile.
- Hostile?

401
00:24:27,857 --> 00:24:28,909
Calm down, sir.

402
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,271
I am calm.

403
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,642
What's under the blanket?

404
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:37,347
Open the door and step aside.

405
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,024
Do you know who the hell I am?

406
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:43,715
I was just up on stage
with councilman Booth.

407
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:46,430
And this morning,
I had breakfast with Count Chocula.

408
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:48,712
Now open the door, and step aside.

409
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,928
Correct me if I'm wrong,

410
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:06,840
but didn't councilman Booth say
that you did time?

411
00:25:09,252 --> 00:25:11,726
Sure hope this isn't your third strike.

412
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:19,605
Scuse me, I'm looking for the detectives
in charge of the Garza case.

413
00:25:19,606 --> 00:25:21,559
Well, you're having me. Detective Choi.

414
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,060
I'm Rita Shelten,
one of your detectives called me.

415
00:25:24,347 --> 00:25:27,648
I'd like to talk to you about
my boyfriend, Brett Hopper.

416
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,288
Come with me.

417
00:25:32,153 --> 00:25:34,258
This whole thing is a huge mistake.

418
00:25:34,272 --> 00:25:35,516
Brett's being framed.

419
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:41,160
What's this supposed to mean?

420
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:43,966
Well, at least you all have
your story straight.

421
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,450
Look, Hopper's sister was in here
earlier repeating the same thing.

422
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:48,558
OK, first off...

423
00:25:49,077 --> 00:25:51,469
I resent your tone.
Brett was with me all night.

424
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,966
So basically you're calling me a liar.

425
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:54,210
I never said that, Ms. Shelten.

426
00:25:54,211 --> 00:25:57,094
And second, I don't think
you understand the kind of man Brett is.

427
00:25:57,095 --> 00:25:59,096
He lives his job 24/7.

428
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:00,463
He believes in it.

429
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:03,425
That's the kind of guy
who'd charge into a burning building

430
00:26:03,426 --> 00:26:04,500
to save a stranger.

431
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:07,439
You're after the wrong man.

432
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:11,257
Excuse me.

433
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,477
Got something upon the guy
the sister mentioned, Fencik.

434
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:18,910
He owns a chop shop in Chasworth.

435
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,426
You might wanna check it out.

436
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:22,343
I thought you said
this was a waste of time.

437
00:26:22,344 --> 00:26:25,022
Probably is, but at least
it will look you did the leg work.

438
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,708
You're late.

439
00:26:39,091 --> 00:26:40,669
Guys in narcotics, looking for you.

440
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,915
Yeah, I know, I'll be in
as soon as I process this guy.

441
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:44,230
We do this now. Come on.

442
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,206
Go ahead and get started.

443
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,120
I'll be back to question him in a bit.

444
00:26:50,148 --> 00:26:52,444
You're making a big mistake, <i>mi reina</i>!

445
00:26:52,942 --> 00:26:55,553
Then how come you're the queen
going to jail?

446
00:27:05,513 --> 00:27:07,550
I've nothing to tell you, <i>perro</i>

447
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,381
<i> Do you hear me?<i/>

448
00:27:11,603 --> 00:27:13,913
<i>Put the guns down
or we're gonna put you down.<i/>

449
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:16,674
<i>Put 'em down!<i/>

450
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,037
I'm coming at a bad time?

451
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:24,472
Nah, come on in, uh?

452
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:26,570
And close the damn door.

453
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,802
Alright, now on the count of three,

454
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,757
we're all gonna lower our guns.

455
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,962
One...

456
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:41,781
Two...

457
00:27:43,367 --> 00:27:44,406
Three.

458
00:27:51,163 --> 00:27:52,202
It was worth a try.

459
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,348
What the hell are you doing here?

460
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:55,482
How do you know this cop?

461
00:27:55,537 --> 00:27:56,917
Oh, me and D, we go a way back.

462
00:27:57,908 --> 00:28:00,586
We got the same thing going on
as you and my partner,

463
00:28:00,587 --> 00:28:01,626
Andrea Battle.

464
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,933
You and Battle...

465
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,942
Is that a fact?

466
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:08,757
Cast no stones, friend.

467
00:28:18,651 --> 00:28:21,186
Now that you two are caught up,
will somebody please explain me

468
00:28:21,187 --> 00:28:22,916
what you're doing hanging together?

469
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:25,351
Cause the last time I checked,
Kwai Long and LDs

470
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:27,879
didn't play the same sand box.

471
00:28:28,494 --> 00:28:31,431
This little party has anything to do
with Torrez's got going on tonight?

472
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:34,701
D?

473
00:28:35,508 --> 00:28:36,574
Outside.

474
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:38,487
We're not done here.

475
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:52,641
- Where did you get in this stuff, Hop'?
- Come on, D...

476
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:56,002
I know Torrez is working on some kind
of a deal with councilman Booth.

477
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:59,297
And this has nothing to do
with any anti-gang initiative.

478
00:28:59,758 --> 00:29:00,906
Torrez is a trader man.

479
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,994
He's selling out the soul of the LDs,

480
00:29:02,995 --> 00:29:04,720
making deals with baby kissers
like Booth.

481
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:06,277
But what's Torrez getting out of it?

482
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:07,316
Protection.

483
00:29:07,986 --> 00:29:09,954
He gets to move his product
uninterrupted.

484
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:12,357
- So he's out of retirement.
- Retired?

485
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:14,313
He didn't even
take the week-end off, Hop'.

486
00:29:14,343 --> 00:29:17,186
Meanwhile Booth gets the cut of
his profits and a nice public victory.

487
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:18,852
Just in time for campaign season.

488
00:29:18,853 --> 00:29:19,892
Public victory?

489
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:21,655
What do you mean, like bust?

490
00:29:23,856 --> 00:29:26,110
You were planning to turn in Torrez
at the Feds, uh?

491
00:29:27,053 --> 00:29:29,117
That's what Baxter wanted
to testify about.

492
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:31,006
LD's supposed to be family, man.

493
00:29:31,348 --> 00:29:33,985
See Torrez, he don't care about
how many <i>hermanos</i> get sold out.

494
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:36,991
As long as he gets his house in burbs
and a fat corporate expense account.

495
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:38,692
That's why you're here,
meeting with Slim.

496
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:41,324
So you can put yourself together
a little rebel alliance.

497
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:44,805
Take Torrez out, maybe grab yourself
a corner office while you're at it.

498
00:29:44,806 --> 00:29:45,933
Spoils of war, Hop'.

499
00:29:47,098 --> 00:29:50,507
Besides, ain't gonna be no sacrificial
lamb for some White politicians.

500
00:29:50,508 --> 00:29:53,241
Now, what about this summit
Torrez has going on tonight.

501
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:54,799
You wanna think about that?

502
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:56,180
No, man.

503
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:58,667
Maybe he's gearing up
to make a round at me.

504
00:29:58,892 --> 00:29:59,938
No offense,

505
00:29:59,939 --> 00:30:02,720
but I doubt he'd need a crate
full of guns for that.

506
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:04,880
What guns?

507
00:30:06,995 --> 00:30:08,389
Hey, Ballanger!

508
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:09,906
What happened to my collar?

509
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,542
Told you to process the guy,
now I hear he's getting loose.

510
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:14,608
Look, I booked the guy.
Then he made a phone call.

511
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,248
Next thing I know, they tell me
the charges have been dropped.

512
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,178
- Who did he call?
- I don't know.

513
00:30:26,736 --> 00:30:28,882
This garage we're going to...

514
00:30:29,073 --> 00:30:30,768
What kind of heavy metal you see?

515
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:32,135
Like real heavy.

516
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:34,413
Fully automatic military grade

517
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:36,315
- You sure these were LDs?
- Yeah.

518
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:37,996
Torrez is with them.

519
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:41,001
He had a crate of this stuff,
he's supposed to leave it

520
00:30:41,002 --> 00:30:42,622
to the summit that's going down tonight.

521
00:30:42,623 --> 00:30:44,954
This don't sound like
no casual meeting great to me, Hop.

522
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,702
Sounds like they're gearing up for war.

523
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,219
War with who?

524
00:30:53,204 --> 00:30:55,924
You waste these fools,
I get first digs on the guns though.

525
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,991
What happened to the weapons?

526
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:11,820
You.

527
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:13,590
- Where's the summit?

528
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:16,851
- Yeah, right.
- Ho, don't worry, Hop.

529
00:31:17,384 --> 00:31:18,969
We speak the same language.

530
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,785
<i>Hablas</i> Smith & Wesson?

531
00:31:27,673 --> 00:31:28,957
Hey, Andrea, what's up?

532
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,106
Torrez was let out.

533
00:31:30,243 --> 00:31:31,486
Charges were dropped.

534
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:34,001
- Booth for progress.
- Yeah, that's what I thought too

535
00:31:34,002 --> 00:31:36,161
but before he was released,
he made a phone call,

536
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:38,128
and it wasn't to Booth,
<i>it was to a bar</i>.

537
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,913
- A bar?
- <i>Yeah, and it gets better.</i>

538
00:31:39,914 --> 00:31:42,538
The place is called The Summit.
It's a biker hangout downtown.

539
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,636
- <i>You want the address?</i>
- Yeah.

540
00:31:46,228 --> 00:31:47,237
We gotta go.

541
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:48,880
What about these two?

542
00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:54,972
Torrez is gonna hit the skinheads.

543
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:56,749
That explains the fire power.

544
00:31:57,186 --> 00:31:59,426
- It should be a blood bath.
- I know, we gotta move.

545
00:31:59,427 --> 00:32:01,744
We? Bud, you got a mouse in your pocket?

546
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,316
My own people want me dead.

547
00:32:03,497 --> 00:32:04,520
Skinheads do too.

548
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:08,076
That's what Sun Tzu would call
a lose-lose situation.

549
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:09,237
Then what, is that a no ?

550
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:28,615
Consider this as a start.
Seven guns per case.

551
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:31,909
Ten cases total.
That's seventy guns on the street.

552
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,545
Booth is guaranteeing us protection
from Jambo to Tijuana.

553
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:37,854
Cops like this one will be sport.

554
00:32:39,618 --> 00:32:42,146
There is nothing
that can stand in our way.

555
00:32:42,911 --> 00:32:45,741
All we have to do is get along.

556
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:54,831
Get out!

557
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:01,407
What's up, fellows?

558
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:10,228
You shoot,

559
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:11,855
you die.

560
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:23,981
Choi, you OK ?

561
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:25,951
Do I look OK to you?

562
00:33:27,364 --> 00:33:29,850
You be easy Fencik
or one of these coming right at you.

563
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:32,498
I gotta say,

564
00:33:32,524 --> 00:33:34,866
I thought I was showing up
for a rumble in the jungle.

565
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:37,994
But instead,
this is one big happy love fest.

566
00:33:40,546 --> 00:33:41,891
These guns are for war ?

567
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:43,208
They're peace offering.

568
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:46,117
A skinhead alliance

569
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:47,858
with the Latin Disciple.

570
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:50,200
All brokered

571
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,738
by councilman Booth

572
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:54,212
and his little lapdog.

573
00:33:55,298 --> 00:33:57,130
You're not gonna make it
outta here alive.

574
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:58,269
That's ok.

575
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,660
As neither are you.

576
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,722
Tell me something, Este.

577
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,389
How many of your crew
did you have to give up

578
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,721
for that hand-tailored suit, uh?

579
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,787
Twenty? Thirty percent?

580
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,843
And you're...

581
00:34:13,574 --> 00:34:15,615
calling yourself White Sea Premise.

582
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,375
Listen to this Latino promise you

583
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:21,979
a bigger a piece
of your own American dream.

584
00:34:22,764 --> 00:34:25,133
What makes you think
Booth is gonna deliver anyway?

585
00:34:27,718 --> 00:34:28,935
What makes you think

586
00:34:29,014 --> 00:34:31,317
one single city councilman

587
00:34:31,318 --> 00:34:34,484
has enough power to keep everybody
looking the other way?

588
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:36,865
You have no idea
what you're messing with.

589
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,400
Oh, is that right, Buchalter?

590
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:42,712
Won't you get your ass over here
and help me cut him loose?

591
00:34:43,504 --> 00:34:44,538
I don't think so.

592
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:45,781
Help me cut him loose!

593
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:46,841
Or what ?

594
00:34:47,496 --> 00:34:48,705
You'll blow yourself up?

595
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:51,977
You don't have the stones for it.

596
00:34:58,046 --> 00:34:59,048
Wanna bet?

597
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:07,961
It's ringed!

598
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:12,576
Move !

599
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:14,900
Everyone freeze !

600
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:27,793
It's about time you showed up.

601
00:35:28,183 --> 00:35:29,491
Next time, dial faster.

602
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,982
So, I called Rita.

603
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:55,628
Chad's there.

604
00:35:56,975 --> 00:35:58,507
So, she's safe.

605
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:00,109
Thanks, Andrea.

606
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,776
For everything.

607
00:36:07,275 --> 00:36:09,101
Hopper, I don't know
what this is all about.

608
00:36:09,102 --> 00:36:10,642
But I still got to do this.

609
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:13,514
- You're under arrest for the murder...
- Yeah, I know.

610
00:36:16,112 --> 00:36:17,153
That's my cover.

611
00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:18,457
You sure ?

612
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:20,064
You don't look so good.

613
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:21,883
I got it.

614
00:36:37,734 --> 00:36:38,745
And I gotta...

615
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:41,565
...thank you.

616
00:36:43,774 --> 00:36:45,997
You didn't have to save my ass
back there, but you did.

617
00:36:46,502 --> 00:36:48,085
And you'd still be free if you didn't.

618
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:54,378
Why were you at that bar?

619
00:36:55,262 --> 00:36:56,498
I was following a lead.

620
00:36:57,292 --> 00:36:58,395
Lead from who ?

621
00:36:59,513 --> 00:37:00,538
From your sister.

622
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:02,314
She mentioned those two guys.

623
00:37:02,315 --> 00:37:03,577
The ex-LA sheriffs.

624
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:05,531
Fencik and Buchalter.

625
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:07,033
She said there were framing you.

626
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:10,009
And you believed her ?

627
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,155
No, not at first.

628
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:12,791
But then, your girldfriend came in,

629
00:37:13,075 --> 00:37:15,352
in a pretty passionate statement
vouching for you.

630
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:18,087
She said some things that...

631
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:23,561
Anyway...

632
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:26,233
they really want the best for you.

633
00:37:26,841 --> 00:37:27,948
It's nice to know.

634
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:30,060
Look, man.

635
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:32,632
I work homicide,
okay ? I don't know anything about

636
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,424
gangs or councilmen or...

637
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:36,394
or whatever was going on in that bar...

638
00:37:36,395 --> 00:37:37,618
I didn't killed Garza.

639
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,136
I just can't prove it yet.

640
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:51,173
What would you need ?

641
00:38:01,076 --> 00:38:03,241
Mrs. Garza didn't want
to stay in the house.

642
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:04,801
You can probably imagine.

643
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:07,107
Walk me through.

644
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:09,814
Obviously anything important
we bagged and tagged.

645
00:38:12,628 --> 00:38:13,776
Windows were closed.

646
00:38:13,814 --> 00:38:15,250
No signs of forced entry.

647
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,070
The body was here.

648
00:38:18,704 --> 00:38:19,705
Three bullets.

649
00:38:19,706 --> 00:38:21,821
Two to the chest, one to the head.
Execution style.

650
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:23,381
Gone through-and-throughs.

651
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:26,057
Coroner pulled three clean slugs, 9 mm.

652
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:27,315
Prints ?

653
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,724
Yeah. Garza's, Mrs. Garza,
the clean lady.

654
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:30,741
But not mine ?

655
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:34,156
Not here.

656
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,647
Don't you think it's a little funky

657
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:39,169
that I would be careful enough
not to leave a single print here.

658
00:38:39,272 --> 00:38:40,919
But then hide the murder weapon

659
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,927
with the prints

660
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:42,987
In my own closet.

661
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:47,953
Where does Mrs. Garza say she saw me?

662
00:38:47,954 --> 00:38:50,507
She said she heard commotion
from upstairs.

663
00:38:51,232 --> 00:38:52,858
She came of that door away.

664
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:57,070
And you were standing
over her husband's body here,

665
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:58,100
with a gun.

666
00:38:59,062 --> 00:39:00,087
So she ran.

667
00:39:03,256 --> 00:39:04,281
What about the safe?

668
00:39:05,341 --> 00:39:06,778
We opened it first thing.

669
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:11,142
There wasn't anything in there,
it was cleaned up before LAPD showed up.

670
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,203
Whatever Garza kept in here,

671
00:39:14,204 --> 00:39:15,234
he got rid of it.

672
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,705
You called and left me a message
about this package.

673
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:20,148
- He told me to call you.
- Who?

674
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:24,410
When he brought me the packages,
they were both sealed.

675
00:39:25,932 --> 00:39:27,784
I think I know what was inside.

676
00:39:28,598 --> 00:39:30,793
Evidence from one
of my father's old cases.

677
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:31,974
Garza sent it to me.

678
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,005
That's why he was killed.

679
00:39:34,062 --> 00:39:35,456
Your dad's case ?

680
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:39,206
And that's why you think
they're framing you ?

681
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:41,180
One of the reasons.

682
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:43,984
And this is connected somehow with...

683
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,148
With that bar

684
00:39:45,573 --> 00:39:47,364
and the gangs, councilman Booth?

685
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,031
Yes, the councilman
is behind Garza's murder.

686
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,768
- So, we bust him!
- No, it won't be that easy.

687
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:54,390
This doesn't end with Booth.

688
00:39:55,246 --> 00:39:56,621
Look on the bright side.

689
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,949
With everything we got tonight,

690
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,389
we're gonna get these guys.

691
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,675
And by tomorrow, you're a free man.

692
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:06,644
I hope so.

693
00:40:11,362 --> 00:40:12,377
What ?

694
00:40:19,174 --> 00:40:20,724
Somebody messed with this.

695
00:40:20,725 --> 00:40:21,936
What are you talking about?

696
00:40:21,937 --> 00:40:22,963
There was a fax here.

697
00:40:22,964 --> 00:40:25,000
I saw it this morning
before we photoed the room

698
00:40:25,001 --> 00:40:26,366
but it's not on the picture.

699
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:27,375
Someone took it.

700
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:30,959
I will check the machine,
see what time the last fax was sent.

701
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:34,541
Last night.

702
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,921
That's my home number.

703
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:40,328
Wait. Garza faxed you last night ?

704
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:43,083
He must have tried.
I don't have a fax at the house.

705
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:44,876
Does this sort of fax has a memory ?

706
00:40:56,077 --> 00:40:57,489
Miguel Dominguez.

707
00:40:58,152 --> 00:41:00,229
Why would Garza send this to you?

708
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,611
<i>That thing you asked about</i>

709
00:41:03,614 --> 00:41:05,575
<i>matched a guy named Miguel Dominguez.</i>

710
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:06,987
<i>That Jane Doe case.</i>

711
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:10,273
<i>Your dad already had a suspect,
this Dominguez guy.</i>

712
00:41:10,532 --> 00:41:12,857
<i>Trouble was, he was locked up
in Pelican Bay at the time.</i>

713
00:41:12,858 --> 00:41:14,078
<i>He is the Boogey Man.</i>

714
00:41:14,187 --> 00:41:15,240
<i>He's like Freddy.</i>

715
00:41:15,937 --> 00:41:17,331
<i>Kill you in your dreams.</i>

716
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:20,016
He wanted me to find out.

717
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:22,823
Looks like I'm going to Pelican Bay...
