2
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,720
<i>My name is detective Brett Hopper,</i>

3
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:16,618
<i>and this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

4
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:17,804
Put your hands up!

5
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:20,897
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

6
00:00:20,963 --> 00:00:22,694
<i>I will be framed for murder...</i>

7
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:24,924
Who the hell are you people?

8
00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:27,128
<i>... my girlfriend Rita
will be in danger.</i>

9
00:00:27,764 --> 00:00:30,785
<i>I know all this
because I am living the same day...</i>

10
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:32,807
<i>over and over again.</i>

11
00:00:32,987 --> 00:00:35,783
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

12
00:00:35,944 --> 00:00:37,484
<i>Every day, I get another chance.</i>

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,742
<i>For every decision,
there's a consequence.</i>

14
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,047
<i>Every day, I get another clue.</i>

15
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:45,055
<i>Hopper, you should have received
a package today. It's important.</i>

16
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,675
<i>So far I've got an hourglass
with a fingerprint</i>

17
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,549
<i>and a photo from an old crime scene.</i>

18
00:00:49,623 --> 00:00:51,733
I'm looking into a homicide from 1991.

19
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:54,232
- That's when I met your old man.
- My father was there?

20
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:56,479
He was the lead detective on it.
But he didn't close it.

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,506
Evidence went missing,
and it just all fell apart.

22
00:00:58,553 --> 00:01:00,358
<i>To find out more about this evidence,</i>

23
00:01:00,414 --> 00:01:02,767
<i>I have to get past
Rita's ex-husband Chad...</i>

24
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:03,787
Why do I get the feeling

25
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:05,902
- you know more than you're telling?
- Because I do.

26
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:08,490
<i>... and go to the one place
that's most dangerous to me:</i>

27
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,480
<i>police headquarter.</i>

28
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:18,686
- Give me that.
- No.

29
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,742
- Stop playing.
- What's a "Nitzberg"?

30
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:23,405
A Nitzberg...

31
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:25,935
that's a name I'm using
for this undercover thing.

32
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:27,058
- Really?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:27,114 --> 00:01:29,436
- You're so not a Nitzberg.
- Well, that's the point.

34
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:30,532
And who's Sid?

35
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:32,185
Sid? There's a Sid on there?

36
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:34,149
Here. "Take hourglass to Sid."

37
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:38,269
That's S-I-D, silly...
scientific investigations division.

38
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:41,012
After I drop you off at work,
I'm going downtown.

39
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:44,089
The hourglass is evidence,
and I need to see if S.I.D.

40
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,717
can pull a print on it for me.

41
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,241
Sounds like a busy day.

42
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:48,862
Yeah, it's pretty crazy,

43
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:54,536
but, for the first time in a while,
I think I see some daylight.

44
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:02,323
<i>- Watch commander.</i>
- Yeah, this is Hopper. Any messages?

45
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:04,990
<i>- Anybody looking for me?
- Hang on, let me check.</i>

46
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:06,096
All right.

47
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:10,342
<i>Na Hop, nothing but crickets
on this end.</i>

48
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,580
All right, cool. I'll call back later.

49
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:26,077
Hopper! Hold up.

50
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:27,565
I'll be there in 15.

51
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,139
Hey, lieutenant.

52
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,828
I know what's going on.

53
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,113
You do?

54
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:38,950
What time is your I.A. meeting
with Shelton?

55
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,823
- At 3:00.
- All right.

56
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:44,045
You hang tough,
and don't do anything stupid.

57
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:48,657
A little late for that.

58
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:55,169
Don't touch the bubble head.

59
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:59,231
I need you to run a print
on this hourglass.

60
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,829
Here you go. You know the drill.

61
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:09,703
- Call you in a week.
- No. I need it today.

62
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:13,155
That's gonna be a problem. I already got
20 guys who need it yesterday.

63
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,792
Hey, here's a thought.
Why don't you come back last week,

64
00:03:16,858 --> 00:03:19,814
and then I can have it
ready for you this afternoon?

65
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:23,339
So are we doing this or not?

66
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,116
All right. Can you run
this D.R. Number for me instead?

67
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,678
Is it connected to this hourglass?

68
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:29,986
Yeah, that's what I'm trying
to figure out.

69
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:32,061
Come on, it'll take two seconds.

70
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,172
What's the number?

71
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:39,872
- "91-11"
- 91? As in 1991?

72
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:41,025
Yeah.

73
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:46,236
"91-118394641."

74
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:54,158
- That's weird.
- What?

75
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:57,240
You're the second cop to open up
this Jane Doe in a couple days.

76
00:03:57,306 --> 00:03:58,317
Who's the first?

77
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:00,991
Some tool in I.A.: Chad Shelton.

78
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:06,203
Hey. I need to talk to you.

79
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:10,647
That's why we have a 3:00.
Fix your watch. Come back then.

80
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:12,565
Jane Doe. 15-year-old homicide.

81
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:15,864
Sounds fascinating. Talk to cold case.

82
00:04:15,865 --> 00:04:17,614
Yeah, well, I hear
you're looking into it.

83
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:20,289
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- It's a case my father worked on,

84
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,517
an unsolved homicide.

85
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:24,138
Your dad had a lot of those.

86
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:25,492
Be more specific.

87
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:29,889
D.R. Number 91-118394641.

88
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,290
- 4641?
- Yeah.

89
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,284
Well, let me think.

90
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:39,228
Is that the murder book?
Is that the case?

91
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,350
Maybe.

92
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:46,526
Hey, man, why are you messing with me?

93
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:48,639
'cause I don't like you.

94
00:04:58,664 --> 00:04:59,664
Shelton.

95
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:03,696
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:06,301
I understand.

97
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:08,292
For you.

98
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:18,040
Detective Hopper,

99
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,537
you're under arrest
for the murder of Alberto Garza.

100
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:24,210
Why'd you do it, man?

101
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:27,818
I'm not saying a damn thing
until you bring me Rita Shelton.

102
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:36,579
It's embarrassing, isn't it, chained up?

103
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:41,556
<i>I've got to get to my brother!</i>

104
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,530
I thought it'd be different this time.
Didn't you?

105
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:49,228
You know what I'm talking about?

106
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,164
You and me are the same,
salt and pepper,

107
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:53,165
a couple of flies in the ointment.

108
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,352
You don't believe me? I can prove it.

109
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,540
Give me your arm.

110
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:06,162
Quick, before they take one of us
away. Come on, hurry up.

111
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,626
I told you... we taste the same!

112
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,918
We all taste just like chicken!

113
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:22,874
Look, it gets worse before it gets
better! Just ask my brother!

114
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,638
Okay, listen to me.
Everything is gonna be all right.

115
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,403
I'm gonna get you out of this.

116
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:19,619
I wouldn't make any promises just yet,
detective Hopper.

117
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:21,884
You and your friend Ms. Shelton are here

118
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,898
because you're going to confess
to the killing of Alberto Garza.

119
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:26,816
Okay, okay, whatever you want.

120
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:28,724
Okay? Just let Rita go.

121
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:32,056
- Well, it's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

122
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:33,198
You got me.

123
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,640
All right? I confess. I killed Garza.

124
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,578
Oh, you're scared, rightfully so,

125
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,916
but I don't think you understand

126
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:45,281
- the importance of what I'm asking.
- What are you talking about?

127
00:07:47,058 --> 00:07:48,485
I'm cooperating.

128
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,722
What else do you want from me?

129
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,210
The hourglass?

130
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:55,835
You want that picture
with the girl on it? Is that it?

131
00:07:56,197 --> 00:08:00,601
It seems I underestimated
your awareness of the situation.

132
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,896
I don't know what they mean.
You can have them.

133
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:04,700
Take 'em. Just let her...

134
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:06,675
Let her go.

135
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:08,204
Tell me,

136
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:11,360
do you believe in déjà vu?

137
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,459
What did you say?

138
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:17,439
I'm reminded of another time,
another place...

139
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:21,089
and a different detective Hopper.

140
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,049
What are you talking about?

141
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:25,672
You see,

142
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:27,382
a long time ago,

143
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:29,934
I made an error in judgment.

144
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:32,347
Now it's come back to haunt me.

145
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,375
You know what that error was, detective?

146
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:37,607
Compassion.

147
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:41,774
People will promise anything
to avoid pain.

148
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:44,329
Get away from her.

149
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,641
Get away from her!

150
00:08:50,242 --> 00:08:51,460
Now remember...

151
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:54,505
there are other people you care about.

152
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,710
Your sister...

153
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,552
- Please, no! Okay...
- ... her children...

154
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,070
I'll do whatever you want.

155
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:01,457
I will do whatever you want.

156
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:02,881
It's an empty promise.

157
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,195
It needs to be clear.

158
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:11,373
You need to understand
just how serious I can be.

159
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:38,342
It was hilarious.

160
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:42,585
So the father stops for a second
to put a new tape in his camcorder.

161
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:44,773
He was one of those scary,
overinvolved dudes

162
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:47,774
who probably videotaped
the moment of conception...

163
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,054
So he puts back the tape,

164
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,391
and rushes into the delivery room...

165
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,334
- I'm so boring you.
- No, no you're not.

166
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:59,020
- Please keep talking.
- No, no, it's okay.

167
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:02,379
I know my nurse stories
aren't as exciting as, you know,

168
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,107
"Tell me where the bomb is!"

169
00:10:12,024 --> 00:10:13,024
What?

170
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:16,467
I'm just really glad you're here.

171
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:21,361
Who are you right now,
and what did you do with Brett Hopper?

172
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,664
Okay, so you offer to drive me to work.

173
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:29,564
Now we're sitting here having breakfast.

174
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:33,069
Is there something you want to tell me?

175
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:35,891
Actually, there is.

176
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:39,709
I've been working on this new case,

177
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:43,006
and it involves
some pretty scary people,

178
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:47,906
and I'm afraid of what these people
might be willing to do.

179
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:50,654
So, honey, promise me, all right?

180
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,529
If you ever, and I mean ever

181
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:58,524
find yourself in a position
where you cannot get in contact with me,

182
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,437
I need you to call Chad.

183
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:02,763
He'll keep you safe.

184
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:04,666
What's that supposed to mean?

185
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:08,183
I know it sounds crazy...

186
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,026
but believe me...

187
00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:21,309
Hey, man, don't ever wake me up
this early again no more, all right?

188
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,587
- All right, man, thanks.
- All right.

189
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:27,655
What the hell was that?

190
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:29,753
Just a present.

191
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:38,854
Tomorrow night, behind the dugout.

192
00:11:45,982 --> 00:11:49,038
Gotta get me prints
on this bad boy A.S.A.P.

193
00:11:58,143 --> 00:11:59,541
Done... and done.

194
00:12:06,697 --> 00:12:08,407
Excuse me, lieutenant Graves?

195
00:12:08,784 --> 00:12:10,716
I have some paperwork here
for you to fill out.

196
00:12:10,782 --> 00:12:12,124
Sorry, not now.

197
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:14,762
You'll have to put it on my desk.
Captain wants to see me.

198
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:18,352
Something about Brett Hopper
and this Alberto Garza murder.

199
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:23,087
I see you.

200
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,953
Hey, where is it?

201
00:12:53,526 --> 00:12:55,222
- Where's what?
- The murder book.

202
00:12:55,298 --> 00:12:58,719
D.R. Number 91-118394641. You have it.

203
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:00,151
No, I don't.

204
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,713
You're lying.

205
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:06,759
- I'd be careful if I were you.
- I need the files in that book.

206
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:09,293
What, did you sniff some glue
this morning?

207
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:10,572
Where did you put it?

208
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:12,395
All right, it's not in your office.

209
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:15,241
My office, you went through my office?
You went through my stuff?

210
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:17,863
I.A. has classified files.
I can have you arrested for that.

211
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:19,536
I'm not leaving without it.

212
00:13:20,596 --> 00:13:22,484
Then we'll do this the hard way.

213
00:13:24,874 --> 00:13:27,831
I need that book... now.

214
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:30,781
Gun.

215
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:32,392
Gun!

216
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:39,586
Way to go, genius.

217
00:13:54,678 --> 00:13:56,099
All right, guys, let's hustle up.

218
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:59,244
S.W.A.T. Command at R.H.D.
in five minutes.

219
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,450
Hopper's always been a bit
of a bull in a china shop.

220
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:17,097
Any bad blood between the two of them?

221
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,400
You mean other than Hopper
banging Shelton's wife?

222
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:20,562
Ex-wife.

223
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:24,246
Andrea, this is lieutenant Romero,
S.W.A.T.

224
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:26,531
Detective Battle.
She's Hopper's current partner.

225
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:28,904
Your Lt was just telling me
about this Garza business.

226
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:29,979
How much do you know?

227
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:32,525
Enough that I can tell
something's not right here.

228
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,584
This isn't Hopper.

229
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:36,210
Your honest assessment...
how tough is this gonna be?

230
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,812
Hopper's stubborn, you know?
Sometimes that's a good thing.

231
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:41,974
Sometimes...
let's just say I don't envy Shelton.

232
00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:44,931
Stay close.
I want you in the command post.

233
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,561
Okay, Hopper's here in the I.A. bullpen.

234
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,431
There are exterior windows,

235
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,622
but they don't open.
Everything's locked tight.

236
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,382
I've got shooters down each
of these hallways: here, here, and here.

237
00:14:56,464 --> 00:14:58,618
There's only one way out,
and that's through us.

238
00:14:58,684 --> 00:15:00,421
Hopper's not dumb.
He knows what's coming.

239
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:01,999
Then we won't disappoint him.

240
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:05,924
Were just gonna talk. I like to talk.
Ask my last two wives.

241
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:08,979
99 out of 100 times,
that's all a person wants.

242
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:11,403
And what about the one person
who doesn't?

243
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:12,965
I've been doing this a long time.

244
00:15:13,023 --> 00:15:16,028
We don't explore other options
until my jaw falls off.

245
00:15:16,151 --> 00:15:19,099
Says here we'll have eyes and ears
on Hopper in a couple of minutes.

246
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:21,002
I want to put my men in these halls.

247
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,839
Nothing personal. Don't want anybody
getting nervous, going all cowboy on us.

248
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,153
So has anyone tried to call Hopper yet?

249
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:29,155
Yes. He's not answering his phone.

250
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:31,092
Typical Hopper.

251
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:39,480
You gonna pick it up, or what?

252
00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:44,155
Hello?

253
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,390
You know they're just gonna keep
letting it ring

254
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,620
- until somebody answers.
- I know the protocol.

255
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:51,466
Get demands, kill the A.C.,

256
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:53,098
Eyes and ears--

257
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:55,642
- What?!
<i>- Hopper, it's Graves.</i>

258
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:59,267
I'm gonna hand you over to S.W.A.T.
Lieutenant Romero. He's been doing this

259
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:01,887
<i>- 20 years, so...</i>
- All right, put him on.

260
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:08,969
<i>Everybody okay in there, Hopper?</i>

261
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:13,129
Yeah, well, Chad's ego's a bit bruised,
but I think he'll be just fine.

262
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:15,765
<i>- How about you? You okay?</i>
- I've had better days.

263
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,368
<i>Look, I know you're wanted
for Garza's murder,</i>

264
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:20,059
so I won't sugarcoat this.

265
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:22,593
I've got 10 S.W.A.T. Guys,
about 40 cops,

266
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:25,027
two snipers
and one meat wagon out here, Hopper.

267
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:26,965
Give me a reason to send
the meat wagon home.

268
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:28,495
Okay, send 'em home, then.

269
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:31,039
We can forget this whole thing
ever happened.

270
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,751
- Love to, but I can't.
- But you have a lot of people out here

271
00:16:33,798 --> 00:16:34,968
who really care about you...

272
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:37,404
Yeah, who care, who wanna
see me get through this alive...

273
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:39,154
Whatever, man. Let's just get to it.

274
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:40,387
All right, now...

275
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:42,522
these are my demands.

276
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:43,966
<i>All right,</i>

277
00:16:44,406 --> 00:16:46,641
I wanna see my girlfriend, Rita Shelton

278
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:51,676
and my sister, Jennifer Mathis
with her kids, brought here.

279
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:53,840
<i>- Anything else?</i>
- No.

280
00:16:53,841 --> 00:16:57,040
<i>That's it. Bring them here
so I can see them, and</i>

281
00:16:57,078 --> 00:16:58,136
know that they're safe.

282
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,219
That's it.

283
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:06,890
Found the murder weapon
in Hopper's closet.

284
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:07,966
Yeah, I heard.

285
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,904
Hey, look, pretend you're a cop
for a second.

286
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,029
- Okay, but it's a stretch.
- Just pretend that you killed Garza.

287
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,405
- I can do that.
- Now would you hide the murder weapon

288
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,870
- in your closet?
- No.

289
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:21,007
Would you go into a police station
afterward and take a guy hostage?

290
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,078
I see your point,
but you're forgetting something.

291
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:25,025
- What's that?
- People are stupid.

292
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,406
This is a D-2
we're talking about here, man.

293
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:29,029
Other than us, who on the whole force

294
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,940
knew that Hopper was being taken down?

295
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:32,988
- Maybe a half dozen.
- Exactly.

296
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:35,291
Hopper knows the drill,
knows that word wouldn't go wide

297
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:36,720
until late this afternoon.

298
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:41,529
So he's smart enough to know that,

299
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,150
but stupid enough to pull a gun
on a cop in a police station?

300
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:45,565
'Cause that makes sense.

301
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:49,531
- Who did he take hostage, anyway?
- Shelton in I.A.

302
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,411
Really? Looks like Christmas
came early this year.

303
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:56,216
You know you're wasting your time.

304
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:59,350
S.W.A.T.'S wiring the place.
You're never gonna find anything.

305
00:18:00,592 --> 00:18:01,592
Hey, sit down.

306
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:05,180
At least put the cuffs in front.
I'm losing circulation here.

307
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,962
What was that crap
about Rita and your sister...

308
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:16,867
- all you want's the murder book?
- That's between me and you,

309
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:18,905
I don't trust any of the cops
in this place.

310
00:18:18,906 --> 00:18:21,155
Why were you looking into one
of my father's old cases?

311
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:22,735
I don't know
what you're talking about.

312
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:23,706
Come on.

313
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:25,779
I.A. Pulls old files all the time.

314
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:27,649
I can't remember half the crap
I sign off on.

315
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:29,090
It's standard procedure. Get it,

316
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:30,914
or should I talk slower?

317
00:18:33,782 --> 00:18:36,664
You want the book,
why don't you just ask for it?

318
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:39,876
Why use Rita as leverage?

319
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:43,564
She's not leverage.

320
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,776
The worst part is,
she's gonna come running

321
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,084
- right in here to save you...
- Do I need to gag you?

322
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,530
You don't deserve her. You never did.

323
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:54,198
That ship sailed a long time ago, Chad.

324
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
Let it go.

325
00:19:00,623 --> 00:19:01,718
Picture's up.

326
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:07,116
I know it's hard to watch a friend
do something this irrational.

327
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:12,093
If Hopper pulled a gun on Chad Shelton,
he did it for a rational reason.

328
00:19:13,388 --> 00:19:16,350
Gonna see how we're doing
on Rita and his sister.

329
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:18,469
Ballistics are a match.

330
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,722
The gun in Hopper's closet
is the one that killed Garza.

331
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:22,941
- What about the prints?
- Oh, the lab's backed up.

332
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,243
Roknowski has some rush job.

333
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:28,180
Any chance we might get
audio in my lifetime?

334
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:34,733
We got sound.

335
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:39,788
Hopper's sister and her kids
are en route

336
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:41,342
but there's no word on Rita yet.

337
00:19:41,343 --> 00:19:43,904
If you really give a damn about Rita,
you'd keep her out of it.

338
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:46,603
- I'm trying to protect her.
- You're bringing her into harm's way!

339
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,257
- Sit down.
- You want to see her hurt,

340
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:50,539
- is that it...
- Get your ass back in that chair!

341
00:19:55,118 --> 00:19:56,631
You give up now, they'll bring her in.

342
00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:57,468
I can't do that.

343
00:19:57,469 --> 00:19:58,684
You can if you care about her.

344
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,713
If I get caught, she gets killed.

345
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:02,933
- Is it a threat?
- There are people after me.

346
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:04,449
- They'll kill her.
- What people?

347
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:06,087
- I don't know.
- Because you're a liar!

348
00:20:06,115 --> 00:20:08,243
- I'm not lying. I've seen it.
- You've seen Jack...

349
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,144
I've seen it happen!

350
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:11,583
- I'm not listening any more...
- I've seen Rita die!

351
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,833
I have seen Rita die three times.

352
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:21,846
<i>I get caught, she gets killed.</i>

353
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:23,468
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

354
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:25,657
I'm living this day over and over.

355
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:27,124
If I get caught,

356
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:29,720
Rita will die...

357
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:31,354
<i>again.</i>

358
00:20:38,283 --> 00:20:40,855
Yeah. This is gonna end well.

359
00:20:53,971 --> 00:20:55,199
This is perfect.

360
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:57,161
It's just so you.

361
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:01,524
Basically, the whole world,
the very concept of time,

362
00:21:01,581 --> 00:21:05,200
revolves around Brett Hopper,
'cause you're so special.

363
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:10,286
Man, and people say I got an ego.

364
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:13,382
I know how it sounds,
but it's the truth.

365
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,528
So every morning at quarter past 6,

366
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:19,782
Rita, Andrea... all these people
who've died the previous day...

367
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:21,194
they're all alive again?

368
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:28,392
Well, if there's some cosmic reset
button, why waste time with civility?

369
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,853
Why not just march on in here,
machine guns blazing,

370
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,531
perforate us all, take what you want?

371
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:33,853
Gee, I don't know...

372
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,197
maybe because it's wrong?

373
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,330
Why don't you just give up now

374
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:41,470
- and start again tomorrow?
- I can't do that.

375
00:21:42,723 --> 00:21:45,592
- Why?
- Didn't you just hear a word I said?

376
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,001
I've seen Rita die three times.

377
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,539
Imagine...

378
00:21:52,323 --> 00:21:54,073
seeing her executed...

379
00:21:56,688 --> 00:22:00,137
hearing the gunshot
that takes her life...

380
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:02,569
hearing her screaming.

381
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:06,701
Would you want to live through that
over and over again?

382
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,454
I can't un-see that...

383
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:14,013
and you know what the scariest thing is?

384
00:22:14,972 --> 00:22:17,324
I don't know when tomorrow's gonna come.

385
00:22:18,474 --> 00:22:20,415
What if this day stops repeating?

386
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:24,906
I get caught, and she dies,
and then tomorrow comes

387
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:26,734
and she's gone...

388
00:22:27,785 --> 00:22:28,785
forever.

389
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,747
Would you take that chance?

390
00:22:46,008 --> 00:22:48,161
Thanks for coming in, Mrs. Mathis.

391
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:50,664
We just want to ask you
a few questions about your brother.

392
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:52,285
Of course. Anything I can do.

393
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:55,462
You know, I...
I knew your father back in the day.

394
00:22:56,198 --> 00:22:57,341
He was a good man.

395
00:22:58,035 --> 00:22:59,035
Thank you.

396
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:01,849
It was a real shame what happened.

397
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:08,093
Yeah, it took us all by surprise.

398
00:23:09,411 --> 00:23:12,280
So, you're close to your brother?

399
00:23:13,712 --> 00:23:14,712
Very close.

400
00:23:14,838 --> 00:23:18,660
Great, and if he were going through
a difficult time, he'd confide in you?

401
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,424
You know, it's hard to say.

402
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,729
I mean, you get it...
the whole stoic cop thing.

403
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:27,387
He's very much like our dad that way.

404
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:30,177
Nothing ever seems
to faze them, and then...

405
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:32,698
you know, one day...

406
00:23:35,836 --> 00:23:38,672
Has your brother ever expressed
any ideas that you'd describe

407
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:40,987
as paranoid or conspiratorial?

408
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:46,148
- Conspiratorial?
- Yeah.

409
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,553
No. What are you implying?

410
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:51,334
- We're just trying to determine...
- No, you're implying

411
00:23:51,387 --> 00:23:53,528
that Brett is doing all this
because of a history

412
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:55,282
of mental illness in our family.

413
00:23:57,338 --> 00:23:59,161
I'd like to see my brother now.

414
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,900
<i>Yeah.</i>

415
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:16,069
I've got somebody who wants
to speak to you.

416
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,353
Remember what we talked about.

417
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:23,959
Hey, Brett. It's me.

418
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:25,333
<i>Jen, are you okay?</i>

419
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:28,149
- I'm fine.
- And the kids? How are the kids?

420
00:24:28,197 --> 00:24:30,398
<i>- They're safe. We're all here.</i>
- Okay, okay.

421
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,134
<i>We all want what's best for you, Brett.</i>

422
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:36,914
We want you and...
and Chad to get out safely.

423
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:45,695
- Satisfied?
<i>- Did you find Rita yet?</i>

424
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:50,366
We're still working on it.

425
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:53,522
<i>Look... we had an</i>

426
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:54,514
agreement.

427
00:24:54,704 --> 00:24:56,868
I came through for you.
Your sister is safe.

428
00:24:57,587 --> 00:24:58,587
<i>Now I showed good faith--</i>

429
00:24:58,588 --> 00:25:00,176
I know where this is going.

430
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,091
<i>I'll give you Chad
when you bring me Rita Shelton!</i>

431
00:25:06,928 --> 00:25:10,216
Let's get another camera in there
right now. Move! Move!

432
00:25:14,441 --> 00:25:15,603
What are you thinking?

433
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:17,832
I have concerns that Hopper
has a different agenda

434
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:19,222
than he's been telling us.

435
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:22,366
- You think he's saying good-bye.
- I've seen it enough times.

436
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,458
That's ridiculous.

437
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:26,151
He's concerned about his girlfriend
because we can't find her.

438
00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:28,738
What if we do, we bring her in,
then what?

439
00:25:28,842 --> 00:25:30,897
What if we find her and she's dead?

440
00:25:32,274 --> 00:25:33,509
Thank you, detective.

441
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:37,969
Let's take the A.C. out in there.

442
00:25:38,088 --> 00:25:40,342
I don't want Hopper
to get too comfortable.

443
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:42,278
- You were shot?
- Yes.

444
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:44,152
- When was this?
- Today.

445
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:48,051
- I mean, like, how many "todays" ago?
- I don't know. I lost track.

446
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:51,444
Your wounds carry over
even though no one else's do?

447
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:53,796
Yep, except for the bandages.

448
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:57,764
- I gotta patch this up every day.
- So you get shot, you can die.

449
00:25:59,214 --> 00:26:01,338
- I'm guessing, yeah.
- Good to know.

450
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:03,205
While you're over there
cracking yourself up,

451
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:05,069
you realize
they still haven't found Rita.

452
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,276
- For all I know, they already got her.
- They'll find her.

453
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:13,465
You hear that?

454
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:15,618
Yeah, they killed the air.

455
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:16,900
I hate this part.

456
00:26:19,224 --> 00:26:21,412
Gotta say, even though
you're riding on the short bus,

457
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:23,209
I applaud your attention to detail.

458
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:26,245
Swapping the cell phone battery,
the girl at the pool,

459
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,342
the bus and Margo, is it?

460
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:29,588
It's good stuff.

461
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:32,453
What comes after the bus thing?

462
00:26:33,453 --> 00:26:34,966
I'm serious. I want to know.

463
00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:38,277
I go to my mailbox and I get a package.

464
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:39,322
And what's in it?

465
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:45,094
Evidence...

466
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,942
Something that might clear me.

467
00:27:05,076 --> 00:27:06,107
Hi!

468
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:25,151
Who in the hell is calling him?

469
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,285
- Yeah.
- Before you say one word to me,

470
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,391
they still got ears on you in that room.

471
00:27:30,426 --> 00:27:33,450
For the record, you sound like
a complete whack job.

472
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,078
I got more important things
to worry about right now.

473
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,296
<i>I wouldn't be so sure.</i>

474
00:27:37,327 --> 00:27:38,798
They've got you on suicide watch.

475
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:40,474
- What?
<i>- Listen, there's a suction mic</i>

476
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:43,606
<i>on the window west side of the room.
Lift up the blind, you'll see it.</i>

477
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:44,636
<i>Oh, and you might also</i>

478
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:48,282
notice the half-dozen snipers waiting
to ventilate your bughouse of a brain.

479
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:50,222
Get in the chair.

480
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,964
Hurry up, get in the chair!

481
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:03,528
Where the hell is my picture?

482
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:09,641
He's losing it.

483
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,538
I need you to do something for me.

484
00:28:13,906 --> 00:28:15,016
I need three guys.

485
00:28:15,055 --> 00:28:16,292
Move, move!

486
00:28:20,774 --> 00:28:23,948
So... let's just say
that you're not completely nuts.

487
00:28:25,092 --> 00:28:26,165
Let's...

488
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:30,496
posit the notion that you could
be living the same day over and over.

489
00:28:30,547 --> 00:28:31,785
How is that possible?

490
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:34,802
What with the laws of physics...
and all?

491
00:28:34,853 --> 00:28:38,211
You're not gonna start with
that discovery channel stuff, are you?

492
00:28:38,265 --> 00:28:40,140
You know,
in these last few wonderful hours,

493
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:42,404
my thoughts have alternated between

494
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:45,093
why you'd be trapped in the same day

495
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:49,790
and the most painful way i could
kill you when I get my hands free.

496
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:54,609
I'm thinking about this theory
I read about in an actual book, Hopper :

497
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,427
"Time as a texture."

498
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:59,011
Sometimes it's smooth,
sometimes it's soft...

499
00:29:00,384 --> 00:29:02,243
But other times,
it can be sticky.

500
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,091
- Sticky?
- Yeah.

501
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:05,919
Maybe you're stuck.

502
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:07,423
Here I thought you'd blame it

503
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:09,584
on all the tree huggers
like you do everything else.

504
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,164
Or maybe it's more rooted
in quantum physics.

505
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:16,061
You ever read "Möbius transformations
and the Doppler shift",

506
00:29:16,323 --> 00:29:18,829
or "Spacetime mediation
of quantum interactions"?

507
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:20,051
That is just so you...

508
00:29:21,142 --> 00:29:23,111
- What?
- Just like back in the day,

509
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:25,574
always showing off that education,

510
00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:28,291
like all these plaques
you got up in your office.

511
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:29,767
I'm not showing off.

512
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,176
Forget my theories.

513
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:36,125
Maybe your mom just dropped you on your
head too many times when you were a kid.

514
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:50,481
At least I put some thought into it.

515
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:53,239
Why do you think it's happening?

516
00:29:53,482 --> 00:29:54,978
You gotta have some theories.

517
00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:56,612
It's irresponsible not to.

518
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:58,349
I don't know.

519
00:30:00,218 --> 00:30:03,666
I mean, at first i thought it was 'cause
i was injected with that drug, but...

520
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,355
I'm not talking physical,
"how" it's happening.

521
00:30:06,356 --> 00:30:08,229
I'm talking the metaphysical "why."

522
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,053
Well, maybe it's not about why.

523
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,078
Maybe things just happen to people.

524
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,831
Maybe you were chosen.

525
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,458
No, I...

526
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:18,993
definitely have not been chosen.

527
00:30:19,306 --> 00:30:21,557
Well, then
how do you explain it, Buck Rogers?

528
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:24,028
In your gut,
what does it feel like it is?

529
00:30:25,206 --> 00:30:26,946
I feel like I'm being punished.

530
00:30:30,752 --> 00:30:31,772
Punished...

531
00:30:35,428 --> 00:30:36,497
For what?

532
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:45,107
Maybe you're the victim
of some government conspiracy?

533
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:47,683
I hear they've been doing
some experiments on

534
00:30:47,714 --> 00:30:48,859
- stupid cops.
- Sit down!

535
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,461
That would explain a lot.

536
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:51,683
Sit down!

537
00:30:55,431 --> 00:30:56,436
Initiate, now!

538
00:30:56,537 --> 00:30:57,850
Move, move, move!

539
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,524
Get the hell back!

540
00:31:09,554 --> 00:31:11,120
- Stand down!
- You.

541
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:12,392
Get back!

542
00:31:18,698 --> 00:31:20,648
- What the hell was that?
<i>- Is everyone okay?</i>

543
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:23,728
Shut up, shut up!
I'm only dealing with Andrea Battle.

544
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:27,647
I should blow your head off.

545
00:31:27,664 --> 00:31:30,117
- You tried to kill me!
- I saved you! Thank you'd be fine...

546
00:31:30,152 --> 00:31:32,013
Stop lying! Stop lying!

547
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:33,790
Sniper was gonna put
a bullet in your head,

548
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:35,578
but I pushed you out of the way.

549
00:31:36,952 --> 00:31:40,121
Guy had a .45. Real bullets.
Shoot to kill.

550
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:41,980
That's not protocol.

551
00:31:43,824 --> 00:31:46,596
They should have entered non-lethal...

552
00:31:48,885 --> 00:31:52,493
flash-bangs and bean bag rounds.

553
00:31:52,573 --> 00:31:53,876
The second team did.

554
00:31:55,492 --> 00:31:56,714
Why'd you do it?

555
00:31:58,017 --> 00:31:59,361
What, save your ass?

556
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:04,704
You may be all psycho right now,
but we were friends once...

557
00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:05,815
Partners.

558
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:09,294
I didn't want to see you
go out like that.

559
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,362
Yeah, we were partners but...

560
00:32:12,836 --> 00:32:13,958
we weren't...

561
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:15,503
I mean...

562
00:32:17,513 --> 00:32:19,918
We rode together
every day for two years!

563
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,161
Fine.

564
00:32:25,302 --> 00:32:26,949
Whatever way you wanna put it.

565
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,949
By the way, you owe me $171.53.

566
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:32,384
What?

567
00:32:32,635 --> 00:32:35,120
I bought coffee
twice as much as you did.

568
00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:37,302
About time you paid your debts.

569
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:39,767
You kept a tab?

570
00:32:40,989 --> 00:32:42,111
I'm thorough.

571
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:44,727
It's what makes me good at what I do.

572
00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:48,812
Here you go.
The print was in the system.

573
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:50,436
Hopper. Isn't that the...

574
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,478
Thank you.

575
00:32:54,825 --> 00:32:56,464
Hopper will only talk to you.

576
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:57,668
Come on.

577
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,114
I've got a solution.

578
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,943
If everyone you care about
is in trouble because of you,

579
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:09,699
why don't you get out of the equation?

580
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,597
- What are you talking about?
- Kill yourself.

581
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:14,575
Seems to me if you die,
everyone else will be fine.

582
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:18,449
- You're not getting off that easy.
- Pretty please?

583
00:33:18,507 --> 00:33:21,194
I can't. Not if I can change the day.

584
00:33:21,587 --> 00:33:22,772
What about Rita?

585
00:33:23,454 --> 00:33:25,659
You think you can do
something to change her situation?

586
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,597
Maybe.

587
00:33:27,763 --> 00:33:29,759
What about the guys that are after Rita?

588
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:31,009
What do they want from you?

589
00:33:31,062 --> 00:33:33,021
They wanted me
to confess to Garza's murder.

590
00:33:33,082 --> 00:33:34,567
- So confess.
- I did!

591
00:33:35,526 --> 00:33:37,849
But they said
that I didn't take them seriously.

592
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:40,061
What could be more serious
than taking a cop hostage

593
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:42,718
in a police station
to save the woman you love?

594
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:47,932
Come on man, what kind of cop are you?

595
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:52,162
All these days, you haven't figured out
one way to contact these guys?

596
00:33:54,557 --> 00:33:56,243
<i>You remember Baxter, right?</i>

597
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:06,780
Yo, Hop.

598
00:34:07,234 --> 00:34:08,911
Been looking for you, man.

599
00:34:09,153 --> 00:34:10,850
Damien, I need to speak to Baxter.

600
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:16,537
Well, if I see that fed,
I'll pass word along.

601
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:18,517
That should be easy, 'cause I know

602
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,497
he's stuffed in the back of your truck.

603
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:36,244
Please...

604
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:39,860
It's for you, it's Hop.

605
00:34:41,224 --> 00:34:42,840
<i>- Hopper?</i>
- Baxter, listen good,

606
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,716
'cause I only have time
to tell you this once.

607
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:48,652
Now you gotta follow my exact
instructions, or Damien will kill you.

608
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:50,280
- Do you understand me?
<i>- Yes.</i>

609
00:34:50,281 --> 00:34:51,405
I know about the guys

610
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:53,396
who've been squeezing you,
in the blue sedan.

611
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:56,002
<i>I need you to contact them for me
and tell them I'll give</i>

612
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:57,924
them whatever they want, okay?

613
00:34:57,944 --> 00:35:00,965
I will confess,
but only if they let Rita go.

614
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:02,814
All right, you got that?

615
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:03,854
Yes.

616
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,186
<i>You also gotta tell them... </i>

617
00:35:05,247 --> 00:35:07,429
<i>Now this is really important! Listen...</i>

618
00:35:07,954 --> 00:35:10,378
I know how serious this is.

619
00:35:10,419 --> 00:35:12,641
I understand how serious this is.

620
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:14,227
<i>Repeat that back to me.</i>

621
00:35:15,176 --> 00:35:17,256
You understand how serious this is.

622
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:18,458
All right.

623
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:21,256
Now Baxter, if you screw me on this...

624
00:35:21,691 --> 00:35:22,812
you will die.

625
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,274
I need to make a call.

626
00:35:31,486 --> 00:35:32,930
Detective Battle's here.

627
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:34,284
Thanks for coming, detective.

628
00:35:34,314 --> 00:35:36,780
Rita Shelton's car was just found
on Cahuenga boulevard...

629
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:39,173
Keys still in the ignition,
she's nowhere to be found.

630
00:35:39,213 --> 00:35:41,011
What do you need me to do?

631
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,185
Yeah.

632
00:35:44,215 --> 00:35:45,225
Hey, Hopper.

633
00:35:45,548 --> 00:35:46,548
Heard you missed me.

634
00:35:46,568 --> 00:35:47,594
Did you get it?

635
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:49,902
That thing

636
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:51,962
<i>you asked about matched</i>

637
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,801
a guy named Miguel Dominguez.

638
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:58,013
He's been in Pelican Bay since '89,
serving five consecutive life sentences,

639
00:35:58,034 --> 00:36:02,751
so there's no way he could've killed
anyone in '91, let alone Garza.

640
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:06,168
I thought they were connected.

641
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,034
What about Rita?

642
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,143
He deserves to know the truth.

643
00:36:14,187 --> 00:36:16,217
No, it's the only card we have.

644
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:24,355
They found her car. She's missing.

645
00:36:27,224 --> 00:36:28,547
That was irresponsible.

646
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:31,032
You might've just cost us two lifes.

647
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:32,578
Now get out!

648
00:36:35,972 --> 00:36:37,235
We're ending this now.

649
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:38,631
This is all your fault!

650
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:41,417
All you had to do
was give me the murder book.

651
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:44,596
You come storming on in here...
Did you even think to look in cold case?

652
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:47,092
You know, where they keep
the unsolved murder books?

653
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,719
You didn't even look, did you?

654
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,654
No, I didn't go down there,
'cause you told me

655
00:36:50,698 --> 00:36:52,839
it was in that damn
filing cabinet right there.

656
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:54,395
- I never said that.
- Yes, you did!

657
00:36:54,435 --> 00:36:55,930
- When?
- Today!

658
00:36:58,627 --> 00:36:59,677
Yesterday...

659
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:08,010
How the hell am I gonna get down there?

660
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:10,776
How am I gonna get the murder book?

661
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,120
Looks like your time is up.

662
00:37:31,703 --> 00:37:32,814
Yours, too.

663
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:36,551
Don't shoot!

664
00:37:37,844 --> 00:37:40,703
- Don't shoot, we're coming out!
- If I die, he dies.

665
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,785
If I die, he dies!

666
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:58,385
Did I ever tell you about our honeymoon?

667
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:04,359
Rita and I were on our way to Vegas.

668
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,865
It was a Saturday night.

669
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:09,198
I had this big special dinner planned...

670
00:38:10,794 --> 00:38:12,190
And there was this dog.

671
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:15,247
Thing got nailed on the 15.

672
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:18,197
It was this mangy stray.

673
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:20,456
It was all bloody on its last legs...

674
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:24,248
And meanwhile,
I got bottles of Dom on ice,

675
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:28,625
a 7-course feast,
violins, the whole shot.

676
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,877
Rita had to stop,
had to try to save the thing...

677
00:38:36,877 --> 00:38:38,380
<i>Hopper, where you going?</i>

678
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:41,765
It took a while, but I finally
convinced her we had to go.

679
00:38:41,816 --> 00:38:43,877
She was just so torn up over it.

680
00:38:45,786 --> 00:38:47,725
That's when I knew, that's...

681
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:50,674
that's when I knew
I'd made the right decision,

682
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:52,480
That this was the woman for me.

683
00:38:52,877 --> 00:38:55,154
<i>Hopper, you are leaving us no choice.</i>

684
00:38:55,995 --> 00:38:57,982
A woman with that much heart...

685
00:39:00,846 --> 00:39:04,995
You know, the only reason she's with you
is she pities you, Hopper.

686
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,752
Is that right?

687
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:09,025
She's a rescuer.

688
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:11,530
She needs things she can save.

689
00:39:12,176 --> 00:39:13,650
That why she married you?

690
00:39:13,717 --> 00:39:15,814
No, that's why it didn't work out.

691
00:39:15,888 --> 00:39:17,252
I don't need saving.

692
00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:18,565
Never did.

693
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:20,833
I was fine just the way I was.

694
00:39:20,877 --> 00:39:22,055
Stop right there, Hopper.

695
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:25,468
I ain't going nowhere.
I'm just trying to get to cold case.

696
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,735
You promised to release Chad... if we
brought your sister and Rita Shelton.

697
00:39:29,955 --> 00:39:31,379
Yeah, and you failed.

698
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,075
Rita, did they hurt you?

699
00:39:49,176 --> 00:39:50,237
Are you okay?

700
00:39:51,529 --> 00:39:52,529
I'm all right.

701
00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:56,670
We need to know

702
00:39:57,034 --> 00:39:58,307
that you are a man

703
00:39:58,984 --> 00:39:59,984
of your word.

704
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,721
We need to know how serious you are.

705
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,391
<i>I don't think you understand
the seriousness of what I'm asking.</i>

706
00:40:11,188 --> 00:40:12,765
You see that? You see that?

707
00:40:15,382 --> 00:40:16,377
Yeah.

708
00:40:18,998 --> 00:40:20,943
Now we kept our part of the deal.

709
00:40:21,927 --> 00:40:23,535
I need you to keep yours.

710
00:40:25,614 --> 00:40:26,695
I confess.

711
00:40:27,776 --> 00:40:30,099
I confess to killing Alberto Garza.

712
00:40:30,392 --> 00:40:31,756
All right? I did it.

713
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,120
You hear me?

714
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:42,304
Hey Chad...

715
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:45,293
- Yeah?
- Just so you know...

716
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,505
It was never loaded.

717
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,676
Let's go! Move, move!

718
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:06,407
Don't worry...

719
00:41:07,054 --> 00:41:08,282
I'll look out for her.

720
00:41:09,987 --> 00:41:13,777
Oh, and if you're right?
The book's in the front seat of my car.

721
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:17,397
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

722
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:19,201
You have the right to remain silent.

723
00:41:19,202 --> 00:41:21,831
If you give up the right
to remain silent, anything you say...
