00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,768
<i>My name is Detective Brett Hopper.</i>

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,603
<i>And this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

4
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:20,728
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant DA Alberto Garza.

5
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:22,467
<i>I will be framed for murder.</i>

6
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:25,080
Who the hell are you, people?

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,201
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,444
<i>I know all this because I am living
the same day...</i>

9
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:33,086
<i>...over and over again.</i>

10
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:35,972
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

11
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:37,498
<i>Everyday I get another chance.</i>

12
00:00:37,524 --> 00:00:40,008
For every decision,
there's a consequence.

13
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:42,535
<i>But last time I changed the day,
I made it worse.</i>

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,621
I'm not the one that's different,
this morning.

15
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:47,655
It's you. You're not the same guy
I went to sleep with last night.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,249
<i>Rita doesn't trust me.</i>

17
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:50,697
<i>She's hiding something.</i>

18
00:00:50,904 --> 00:00:52,581
Maybe we know a few things you don't.

19
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:55,520
<i>My dad's old partner Nick
might know what it is.</i>

20
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:57,428
They'll own you, just like they do me,

21
00:00:57,455 --> 00:00:59,358
your girlfriend...
Everybody's got secrets.

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,465
Someone found the body.

23
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:02,050
<i>So I've got to learn Rita's secret...</i>

24
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:04,305
We're looking for a guy,
name of Billy Foster.

25
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:07,153
- So you followed her to the motel.
- What was the name of the motel?

26
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:09,368
<i>... and figure out
how she's connected to all this.</i>

27
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,660
Your girlfriend's got a secret,
that's all.

28
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:24,368
You don't know
what you're talking about.

29
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,180
It's tough keeping tabs
on a girl like that.

30
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:28,892
He shot Shelten 5 times
and shot your girlfriend another 3.

31
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:32,095
- What was the name of the motel?
- Everybody's got secrets, kid.

32
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:52,156
I need your keys and your phone.

33
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:53,736
What the hell are you talking about?

34
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,136
You're being car-jacked.

35
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:03,544
- Shelten?
- Chad, it's Hopper.

36
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:04,808
Hiya, Hopper.

37
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,107
Too bad you left.

38
00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:07,470
You're missing quite a party.

39
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,764
Listen to me.
Do not, under any circumstances,

40
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:11,659
take Rita anywhere near a motel, today.

41
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:13,299
<i>- Do you understand me?</i>
- A motel?

42
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,264
What are you implying?

43
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,976
I'm telling you, if you take her
to a motel, you're both gonna die.

44
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:21,386
- Is that a threat?
- <i>No.</i>

45
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:23,257
I'm trying to save Rita's life.

46
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,659
He said that he was being framed

47
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:29,562
- and that I was in danger.
- Of course he did.

48
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,265
You said he mentioned the name Garza?

49
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:33,833
Rita? Are you okay?

50
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:38,755
Shouldn't you be out canvasing
the neighborhood or something?

51
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:40,841
Yeah, I think we got that covered,
thanks.

52
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:43,804
I will ask you to come down
to the station, make a formal statement.

53
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:46,637
I'll take her.

54
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:50,819
Suit yourself.

55
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:54,483
Chad, you don't have to.

56
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,585
I'm sorry I even called you
this morning. Just something felt wrong.

57
00:02:57,586 --> 00:02:59,143
No, don't be sorry.

58
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:01,125
What you were feeling
this morning is intuition.

59
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:02,396
You were right to call me.

60
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:04,363
Everything's gonna be OK, today.

61
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,071
I promise.

62
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:32,539
What the hell are you doing here, D.?

63
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:34,733
How do you know Nick?

64
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:36,810
The man reached out when you didn't.

65
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:38,234
What are you talking about?

66
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:41,667
- It's got nothing to do with you.
- I got a call from Nick, last night.

67
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:42,926
An ex-cop...

68
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:45,822
Telling me that my ass was about
to get hit at the safehouse.

69
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:47,830
Now, what I'm wondering is

70
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:49,845
how come that call didn't come
from the cop

71
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:51,847
who's supposed to be looking out
for my ass?

72
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:54,977
How would you know about a hit
on a federal witness, Nick?

73
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:56,754
I still got friends, kid.

74
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:58,380
Yeah, you mean friends like Booth?

75
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,921
Let me deal with this.

76
00:04:02,331 --> 00:04:03,541
He's family.

77
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,078
Alright.

78
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:14,030
I gotta go see some family myself.

79
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:20,023
What are you doing here?

80
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:22,116
What can you tell me about Rita Shelten?

81
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:25,135
- Rita who?
- Don't play games with me, Nick!

82
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:28,018
I haven't seen you in months!
You come on in here,

83
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:30,403
throwing these names at me!
What the hell's wrong with you?

84
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,990
Give me some answers or you're gonna get
a bullet in your head.

85
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,144
I wouldn't do that.

86
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,417
Damn! You know, for a big dude,
you're pretty light on your feet, Hippo.

87
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,727
I don't know what's got into you today,
kid.

88
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:45,282
But your dad meant a lot to me,

89
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,469
so I'm just gonna pretend
this never happened.

90
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:49,580
I recommend you do the same.

91
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,072
It's time to go.

92
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:54,157
Nice car you got here.

93
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:55,726
It's a loaner.

94
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,999
Hope you got AAA.

95
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:27,559
TRACKING MODE(del vo)

96
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:50,899
Chad...

97
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:52,458
You know, I can be in there with you.

98
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:55,117
In the interrogation room...
if you want me to be.

99
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,595
Thanks.

100
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:02,480
Calm down.

101
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:04,042
Is that Hopper?

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,576
OK, yes. Slow down.

103
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,211
I know where that is. Okay.

104
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:13,009
I'll be there as soon as I can.

105
00:06:13,313 --> 00:06:14,319
Who was that?

106
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,446
Billy.

107
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:18,704
- Let me guess, he needs money.
- No.

108
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:21,557
He said they found the body.

109
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,795
No, he's lying. He's trying to draw you
into something.

110
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,081
I don't think he is.

111
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,790
Chad, we should go to him.

112
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,824
First, you got to get the statement
over with.

113
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:34,158
The last thing we need to do
is attract attention.

114
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:35,473
Then, we'll deal with Billy.

115
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:36,675
I don't know...

116
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:38,582
He's really upset.

117
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,839
I was there for you before,
I'm here for you now.

118
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,470
We'll take care of this.

119
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:43,689
Together.

120
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:44,988
Come on.

121
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,416
Hey, it's me.

122
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,032
I guess you weren't kidding
about that Garza thing.

123
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:29,033
They dragged Rita in
and grilled her about you.

124
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,141
Is Chad with her?

125
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:31,645
Sergeant Fast-track? Yeah.

126
00:07:32,194 --> 00:07:33,264
He's not leaving her side.

127
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:35,463
Good. Listen, I need you to pull
a couple of favors

128
00:07:35,464 --> 00:07:36,671
from your friends at county.

129
00:07:36,787 --> 00:07:38,619
Run Rita's name to their system.

130
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:42,675
This is when I ask you why
and you give me a really good answer.

131
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:45,487
She was involved
in an incident back in 02.

132
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:47,697
A traffic stop that went sideways.

133
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:50,018
I think that may be linked
to whatever's going on today.

134
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:52,779
You're saying that Rita
has something to do with the Garza hit?

135
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,171
No, not Garza,
but somebody connected to him.

136
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:58,200
A county sheriff named Buchalter.
He's the one who pulled her over.

137
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:00,204
I need to know
what went down, that night.

138
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:01,891
Okay, I'll see what I can find.

139
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:03,562
Alright. Call me back at this number.

140
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:04,901
Watch yourself, partner.

141
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,038
Alright.

142
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,795
tracking mode (del vo)

143
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,046
This isn't the first time
that you've been unsure

144
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:43,046
about someone's whereabouts,
is it Miss Shelten?

145
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,977
Speaking of... Curtis Foster.

146
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:46,300
No. Not going there.

147
00:08:46,532 --> 00:08:48,732
You were brought in
for questioning back in 02.

148
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:50,450
I said we are not going there.

149
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:51,454
The way you're reacting,

150
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:53,014
let me think <i>you</i>have something to hide.

151
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,668
You wanna ask her about Hopper, do it.

152
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:56,526
She's not the one accused, here.

153
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:59,890
We've got the murder weapon
with Hopper's print.

154
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:02,466
We've got an eyewitness
who puts him at the scene.

155
00:09:02,884 --> 00:09:06,305
Now, is it possible he snuck out
last night while you were sleeping?

156
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,234
I don't know.

157
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:14,500
I guess anyone's capable of anything.

158
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:54,138
We need to talk.

159
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,908
This isn't a good time.

160
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:58,266
I'm on my way to a rally
to see if you were right

161
00:09:58,316 --> 00:10:00,299
about our dear friend Alberto Garza.

162
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,477
I need five minutes.

163
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:05,261
You've got two.

164
00:10:25,562 --> 00:10:27,284
I know what you did to Garza.

165
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,657
I don't have that kind of pull, Nick,
you give me too much credit.

166
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:35,575
You get me too little, if you think
I'm gonna swallow that load of bull.

167
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,722
I found your little toy on my car.

168
00:10:39,975 --> 00:10:41,014
What's that?

169
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:42,817
Please...

170
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:44,377
Your tracking device.

171
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,528
You and him planning on shuting me up,
like you did Garza ?

172
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:52,342
Is that why you're here ?

173
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:55,401
You're afraid
something's going to happen to you?

174
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:01,304
I actually came here to do you a favor.

175
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:03,283
That Damien Ortiz kid.

176
00:11:03,404 --> 00:11:05,019
The one from the safe house.

177
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,307
I can give him to you.

178
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,565
And what would be in it for you?

179
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:13,178
Peace of mind.

180
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:16,294
I want to get on my boat

181
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:19,185
and not look over my shoulder
the rest of my life.

182
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:20,526
I want out.

183
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:21,879
Out?

184
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:24,157
After all this time?

185
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:28,303
The time in front of me
is what i'm looking at.

186
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:29,967
I ain't get much left.

187
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:32,726
What's this?

188
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:34,673
The thing you asked for.

189
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,397
A place to stash the girl
when you grab her.

190
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:39,709
It's clean.

191
00:11:39,757 --> 00:11:41,237
Untraceable to us.

192
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:42,670
The guy will adore.

193
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:44,986
Whatever you do with her,

194
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:46,850
I don't want to know about it.

195
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,847
Crap!

196
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:14,866
- Crap!
- You dropped this.

197
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:19,968
Margo?

198
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:37,395
Who is that?

199
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:39,305
No one.

200
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:41,752
<i>Hey, this is Rita. Leave the message.</i>

201
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:44,891
Rita, it's me. You're in danger.

202
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:48,047
I can't explain it but don't go
anywhere near a motel, today.

203
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:51,435
I know it sounds strange, but please,
baby, you've got to trust me on this.

204
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,635
No motels...

205
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:06,544
Hey, Rits.

206
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:08,200
Thanks for--

207
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,798
What's he doing here?

208
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:12,042
I saved your ass last time, remember?

209
00:13:12,194 --> 00:13:13,713
I told you to come alone.

210
00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:16,502
- They know everything.
- Who does?

211
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:24,234
Shelten...

212
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:27,326
it's been a while.

213
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,220
- Hopper?
- Yeah. Did you find anything?

214
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:39,752
Yeah, I sure did.

215
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:41,513
October 2002.

216
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,220
T stop in Simi Valley,

217
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:45,976
the driver was Rita Shelten,

218
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:47,503
<i>and the report was signed</i>

219
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:49,171
by deputy Buchalter,

220
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:51,008
<i>pulling over for a busted tail light.</i>

221
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,499
Ok. And? Keep going.

222
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,079
- That's it.
- That can't be it.

223
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,371
There's something else.
What was in the trunk?

224
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:58,279
Why did Buchalter draw his gun?

225
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:00,453
There's no mention of any of that
in the report.

226
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:03,283
They're covering something up.

227
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,541
Here's something they didn't cover up.

228
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:10,267
They called Rita in for questioning
a couple of days later.

229
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:11,780
For what?

230
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:15,136
Disappearance of a Curtis Foster.
That name ring a bell?

231
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,394
Curtis Fo-- No.

232
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:18,763
Ho, that's weird.

233
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:21,891
The file just cuts off,
like it's half of something.

234
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:24,190
Rita never mentioned any of this to you?

235
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:25,830
No, she's hiding something from me.

236
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:27,132
<i>I gotta find her.</i>

237
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:28,197
What are you gonna do?

238
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:30,385
Get myself some leverage.

239
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:35,506
If there was a problem
you should have gone through me.

240
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:37,714
You know this man?

241
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:40,407
Time to pay an old debt, Miss Shelten.

242
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:43,202
That deal was between us.

243
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:46,641
The deal is done by those
who profit from it.

244
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:48,765
Not just those who make it.

245
00:14:49,383 --> 00:14:50,961
- I thought you and Billy--
- Just...

246
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:52,495
... listen to the man, OK?

247
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:54,597
We do what he says and we can go.

248
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:56,549
Sit down and shut up, Billy.

249
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
You know...

250
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:04,020
it is one thing to bury a body.

251
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,962
And it's quite an other
to make it disappear.

252
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,937
I don't understand.

253
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:14,441
Billy, you said somebody found the body.

254
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:16,903
I don't think Billy was told the truth.

255
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:18,983
This man didn't need to find the body.

256
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,066
He helped us bury it.

257
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:24,736
What do you want from us?

258
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:27,491
There's going to be
a lot of questions about Brett Hopper.

259
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:29,677
You're going to tell the police

260
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,449
that he left your apartement
in the middle of the night.

261
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:34,003
You're asking me to lie.

262
00:15:34,673 --> 00:15:36,327
You should be quite good at it.

263
00:15:36,491 --> 00:15:38,460
You've had four years of practice.

264
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,261
You awoke to see him living.

265
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:43,927
And sometime later you saw him return.

266
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:47,548
I can't do that.

267
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:50,133
- Of course you can.
- No, she's saying it's too late.

268
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:53,618
Rita already gave
her official statement.

269
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:55,809
You gave a statement?

270
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:03,795
And whose decision was that?

271
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,209
Why would that old cop set me up
after saving my ass ?

272
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,476
The only reason he saved you
was so he could deliver you to Booth.

273
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:14,438
See, you're his insurance policy.

274
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:16,310
- For what?
- His life.

275
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:20,074
Nick is only after himself, man,
he don't care about nobody else.

276
00:16:20,498 --> 00:16:22,302
You, me, we're just chips in his pocket.

277
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:24,981
Alright, Hop.

278
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,071
I know you aint drive
all the way here to do me a favor.

279
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:29,343
Sounds like you've got a plan.

280
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:31,715
Nick, still thinks
you can trust him, right ?

281
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:34,272
So then you can get close to him.

282
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,005
How close?

283
00:17:04,636 --> 00:17:05,648
We're even, Hop.

284
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,457
- You're making a big mistake here, kid.
- Where is Rita?

285
00:17:29,557 --> 00:17:30,569
Who is this Rita?

286
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:32,031
Don't lie to me, Nick.

287
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,561
I'm not lying.

288
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,106
What do they have on her?

289
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:36,944
What is this big secret?

290
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,988
I swear on my life,
I don't know what you're talking about.

291
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:43,275
Your life doesn't mean that much to me
so you better swear on someone else.

292
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:46,848
Look, you wanna take a run at Booth,
that's fine by me. I'm just a...

293
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:49,502
- conduct of information.
- Yeah, I've got that.

294
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:53,084
I guess that means you'll give up
anybody to save your own ass, huh?

295
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:54,547
Damien...

296
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:56,406
Me.

297
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,900
I did what I had to do.

298
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,778
Or Booth would've hit me
the way he hit Garza.

299
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:05,934
I gotta say, kid...

300
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:08,770
I don't know what's shorter: your temper
or your memory,

301
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:10,813
after everything I did for your father.

302
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,450
Who stepped in and took care
of your family after he killed himself?

303
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:18,001
Who did your sister call?

304
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:20,710
Who cleaned up the scene?
Took care of the pension?

305
00:18:22,287 --> 00:18:23,665
Wait...

306
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:26,114
I'll make a deal.

307
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:30,247
I get on my boat and disappear.

308
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:32,116
You'll never hear from me again.

309
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:34,059
You got that right.

310
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,743
- Wait!
- Shut up!

311
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:42,832
You had your chance.

312
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:44,431
I swear I didn't know it was her.

313
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:47,043
You found the place
where they're stashing her!

314
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,294
You found it, I know this!

315
00:18:48,348 --> 00:18:50,064
They were looking
for a place to put her,

316
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:51,818
- but I didn't know it is Rita...
- Where?

317
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,512
1012 VS Ombra.

318
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,027
But he never said anything
about hurting her.

319
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:58,025
They're going to kill her.

320
00:18:58,195 --> 00:19:01,134
- Not if she does what they'll ask her.
- I know it.

321
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:02,978
I've seen it.

322
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:05,223
I've known you since you were sixteen.

323
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:06,904
Please!

324
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:10,246
Think of your dad, what would he say?

325
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:31,778
- Andrea.
- Hopper, I was gonna call you.

326
00:19:31,928 --> 00:19:35,181
Okay. Rita is in danger,
she's at 1012 VS Ombra.

327
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,590
How soon can you meet me?

328
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:40,774
They found her.

329
00:19:41,143 --> 00:19:42,549
What? What're you talking about?

330
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:44,723
They found Rita.

331
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:47,159
But too late.

332
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,564
<i>She was with Chad.</i>

333
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:51,765
They are...

334
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:55,146
They're both gone.

335
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:58,146
No, it can't... No... That's...

336
00:19:58,725 --> 00:19:59,997
I told Chad not to go.

337
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:02,124
<i>Where were they?</i>

338
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,156
Tell me where they were!

339
00:20:08,195 --> 00:20:10,689
<i>They said they found them
into some motel.</i>

340
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,930
It's all I know.

341
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:16,483
<i>They're at the coroner's office.</i>

342
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:17,512
We have to go.

343
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:33,456
DAY 2 (del vo)

344
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:47,872
What's wrong?

345
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:51,056
Nothing,
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

346
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:53,595
I'm fine.

347
00:21:56,507 --> 00:21:58,174
I have to get ready for work.

348
00:22:07,965 --> 00:22:10,535
I was thinking
maybe we could take the day off, today.

349
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,599
I don't think I can do that.

350
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:15,523
We could drive up the coast.

351
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,778
You've always said you wanted to.

352
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:21,271
When did I say I wanted to do that?

353
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:24,114
What are you doing?

354
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:26,630
I was... My battery...

355
00:22:26,968 --> 00:22:29,192
ran out so I was just
switching mine out with yours.

356
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,652
I charged that last night,
I'm gonna need that today.

357
00:22:32,493 --> 00:22:35,294
I got some important phone calls
to make, so can I borrow your phone?

358
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:36,606
Well, just hurry up, then.

359
00:22:36,674 --> 00:22:37,850
I have to get going.

360
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,148
Baby!

361
00:22:45,784 --> 00:22:46,822
You...

362
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:48,975
want me to drive you work this morning?

363
00:22:49,037 --> 00:22:50,362
I thought it's out of your way.

364
00:22:50,615 --> 00:22:53,663
I figured we'll spend a little time
with each other, get a little breakfast.

365
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,927
Why are you being so curly with me,
this morning?

366
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:00,415
What was that?

367
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:10,697
Brett, I don't really have time
to do this.

368
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:11,941
Be easy! I just...

369
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,590
Wanna spend some time with you.
Talk.

370
00:23:20,638 --> 00:23:22,838
- Is that my phone?
- Yeah, we must-- I got it.

371
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:24,328
I got it. Hello?

372
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:26,528
Who is this?

373
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:29,152
I got it. Who is this?

374
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,478
Billy, slow down,
you're not making any sense.

375
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:38,914
I'm gonna call you right back.

376
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:41,975
Everything OK? Who's Billy?

377
00:23:42,494 --> 00:23:45,269
It's no one, it's somebody from work,
it's nothing.

378
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:46,362
Work?

379
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:48,184
Who is it?

380
00:23:48,735 --> 00:23:50,416
- It was just work.
- She's not here now.

381
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:52,179
She's not here? Her shift started at 8.

382
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,475
She called in,
said she was taking a vacation day.

383
00:23:55,487 --> 00:23:57,434
You're keeping something from me.

384
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:01,069
- I gotta go.
- Wait! I'm sorry, wait!

385
00:24:01,082 --> 00:24:02,019
I don't have time, OK?

386
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,578
I just wanna know who Billy was
and what that call was about.

387
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:06,664
- None of your business!
- See, this is my business.

388
00:24:06,665 --> 00:24:08,514
- Let go of me, Brett!
- I can't do that.

389
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:09,594
I'm serious!

390
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:11,275
If I let go of you, you will die.

391
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:12,340
Let her go, sir.

392
00:24:13,256 --> 00:24:14,909
It's alright, man. LAPD. We...

393
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,933
Then you should know
not to grab a lady like that.

394
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:19,195
Don't touch me. Wait, Rita!
- Why don't we just

395
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:20,784
- take it easy?
- Let me handle this!

396
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:22,889
- Calm down!
- Don't tell me to calm down!

397
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:27,402
Get your hands on the counter!

398
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:31,037
Hopper just got pinched.

399
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:32,981
Yeah, got it.

400
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:37,327
- Now what?
- Get into position and we wait.

401
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:43,162
Just so you know, that girl is a witness
in a homicide case.

402
00:24:43,163 --> 00:24:45,267
It she gets away,
she's gonna be in serious danger.

403
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:47,263
Now do you want that on your head?

404
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:57,547
I need your phone.

405
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:04,474
Rita, it's me.

406
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:13,997
Billy, it's me. Where are you?

407
00:25:18,845 --> 00:25:21,362
- Where?
- 1012 VS Ombra.

408
00:25:43,824 --> 00:25:44,767
Margo.

409
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,414
It's alright.

410
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:50,859
I'm here to help you.

411
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:52,069
Alright?

412
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,889
- Oh my God!
- It'll be OK.

413
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:55,977
Alright, now can you tell me
what happened here?

414
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:58,711
- Oh my God!
- Okay, look at me.

415
00:25:58,841 --> 00:25:59,874
Margo...

416
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:00,917
Look at me, breathe.

417
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:02,344
Slow it down.

418
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,216
I got you.

419
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:05,207
It's OK.

420
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,860
Alright, there we go.

421
00:26:08,906 --> 00:26:10,139
Alright, now tell me.

422
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:12,345
Where is Rita?

423
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,106
Who is Rita?

424
00:26:16,838 --> 00:26:18,036
How do you know my name?

425
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:19,669
That's a long story but...

426
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,858
I'm a cop.
My name is Detective Brett Hopper.

427
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:23,429
Yeah, that's what they said.

428
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:25,092
They grabbed me at work.

429
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:26,353
Two of them!

430
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:28,830
They said they were cops
and they had badges just like that.

431
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,271
What did these men want?

432
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:33,057
They wanted...

433
00:26:33,245 --> 00:26:35,284
They wanted me to set up a meeting.

434
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:37,211
At the courthouse, tomorrow morning.

435
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,986
They gave me names to call over...

436
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,762
Six, I don't...

437
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:44,514
Maybe seven other judges.

438
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:45,665
Judges?

439
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:47,933
Yeah, a clerk for one.

440
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:50,182
Nitzberg.

441
00:26:51,158 --> 00:26:52,922
And this judge, Nitzberg...

442
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,904
He's your supervisor.

443
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:01,557
Why would these men kidnap you
just to set up a meeting?

444
00:27:01,594 --> 00:27:02,593
I don't know.

445
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:04,819
Something to do
with the grand jury investigation

446
00:27:04,838 --> 00:27:06,392
- he's working on.
- What's it about?

447
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,417
Corruption at city hall.

448
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:10,773
It's all laid down in a...

449
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:12,370
In a sealed warrant.

450
00:27:13,523 --> 00:27:15,517
Alright, I don't understand,
I need to see it.

451
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:18,329
Can you get me a copy of this warrant?

452
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,475
It's locked up in Nitzberg's chamber.

453
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:22,990
Alright, listen to me,
I'm gonna call 911,

454
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,477
they're gonna send a patrol car,

455
00:27:24,505 --> 00:27:26,016
you're gonna be safe there, OK?

456
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:27,274
Alright?

457
00:27:27,527 --> 00:27:28,603
Margo, look at me.

458
00:27:29,072 --> 00:27:30,236
I need that warrant.

459
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,724
There's someone else I need to find.

460
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,799
You're gonna be OK.

461
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:45,377
Andrea, I need you to do some for me,
go to Chad,

462
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,598
and sell me out.

463
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,961
You did the right thing, Battle.

464
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:53,416
I'll make sure
your lieutenant knows about it.

465
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:54,788
Gee, thanks.

466
00:27:54,891 --> 00:27:56,572
What's happening?
Don't do that.

467
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,406
Give it up.

468
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:00,367
Over here, nice and slow.

469
00:28:04,743 --> 00:28:06,232
Thanks, partner, I got it from here.

470
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:07,613
My pleasure.

471
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:10,022
Hey Battle!

472
00:28:11,185 --> 00:28:13,429
I'll make sure to tell your lieutenant
about this, too.

473
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,469
Don't blame her.

474
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,626
This was the only way
I could talk to you.

475
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:20,078
Plenty of time to talk in prison.

476
00:28:20,216 --> 00:28:22,388
- I'll bring you a fruit cake.
- Shut up and listen.

477
00:28:23,014 --> 00:28:24,282
Do you know where Rita is?

478
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,443
It's funny you are asking me.

479
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,241
- Why don't you call her?
- She won't take my calls.

480
00:28:29,936 --> 00:28:31,618
Yeah, she does have a temper.

481
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,449
Although, the making-up part,

482
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,041
- that--
- She's gonna die, Chad.

483
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:37,296
You're threatening her?
'Cause I'll take you...

484
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:39,459
I'm trying to save her.

485
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:41,081
Now, I need your help.

486
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:45,723
I don't know what game
your're playing, Hopper...

487
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,661
I'm not playing.

488
00:28:47,938 --> 00:28:50,522
Look, I know she's been keeping
a secret from me.

489
00:28:50,673 --> 00:28:53,515
A run that she had with a cop
named Buchalter back in 02.

490
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:54,865
I also know she was questioned

491
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:56,992
about the disappearance
of a man the same year.

492
00:28:57,123 --> 00:28:59,336
Now, today, she gets a call
from some guy named Billy.

493
00:29:00,273 --> 00:29:01,284
Some guy?

494
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:04,116
She didn't tell you about Billy?

495
00:29:06,188 --> 00:29:07,230
This is too good.

496
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:09,397
You really don't know.

497
00:29:12,422 --> 00:29:13,572
Billy's her brother.

498
00:29:15,803 --> 00:29:17,625
I guess you two have grown real tight.

499
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,984
At least, I knew who was in her family.

500
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:22,537
Well, whoever he is,
she is on her way to see him now.

501
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,974
And if I don't find out where...

502
00:29:24,143 --> 00:29:25,150
she's gonna die.

503
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:26,751
So...

504
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:28,751
Just call her.

505
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:32,238
Sorry, pal, can't help you.

506
00:29:43,135 --> 00:29:44,172
Call her.

507
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,870
Rita, it's Chad.

508
00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:50,381
Chad, I was just gonna call you.

509
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,968
<i>It's been an awful day.</i>

510
00:29:52,034 --> 00:29:53,536
<i>Brett is acting really weird,</i>

511
00:29:53,846 --> 00:29:54,918
and Billy called.

512
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:56,759
<i>He said...</i>

513
00:29:57,181 --> 00:29:58,552
He said they found the body.

514
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:00,363
Where are you?

515
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:02,468
I'm at the Glen Capri motel in Glendo.

516
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:04,404
You stay there, you don't go in, ok?

517
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:05,514
You wait for me.

518
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:08,771
Hey, sis.

519
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:19,540
Come on, what do you know
that you're not telling me?

520
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:20,851
It's not my place.

521
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,363
Come on, guy, she is my girlfriend.

522
00:30:22,466 --> 00:30:23,771
She was my wife.

523
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,256
We went through a lot together,
if she wants to tell you, she can.

524
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:28,892
What can you tell me about her brother?

525
00:30:29,592 --> 00:30:30,840
- Billy?
- Yeah.

526
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:32,697
Billy's got the word loser,

527
00:30:32,724 --> 00:30:35,772
I bet it is in his DNA, he's like
a genetically engineered screw-up.

528
00:30:37,714 --> 00:30:39,244
What didn't she tell me about him?

529
00:30:40,911 --> 00:30:43,722
Maybe she didn't want you
to think the less of her.

530
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:45,084
So she lied.

531
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,700
Sometimes, a lie is the only way
to protect someone you care about.

532
00:30:52,806 --> 00:30:54,369
I won't lie to the police.

533
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:57,319
Of course you can,
you've been doing it for four years.

534
00:30:57,535 --> 00:31:00,099
Look...
this comes out, we both go to jail.

535
00:31:00,784 --> 00:31:02,449
For me, that's three strikes.

536
00:31:03,535 --> 00:31:07,077
So, I-- Brett was acting
so strange at the diner.

537
00:31:07,697 --> 00:31:08,731
He knew.

538
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,903
He was protecting me.

539
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:13,989
What do you meam, "he knew"?

540
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,283
I don't know who you are.

541
00:31:17,154 --> 00:31:18,572
But I don't want any part of this.

542
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:21,332
I'm out of here.

543
00:31:22,008 --> 00:31:23,050
Rita, wait!

544
00:31:23,276 --> 00:31:25,999
I would rethink my decision,
Miss Shelten.

545
00:31:26,337 --> 00:31:27,341
Please.

546
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,792
I have been protecting you
your whole life, Billy.

547
00:31:29,815 --> 00:31:32,113
- Don't leave me.
- Every arrest, every screw-up.

548
00:31:34,522 --> 00:31:35,696
But I won't do this.

549
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:46,716
Let me talk to her.

550
00:31:47,815 --> 00:31:48,932
I can convince her.

551
00:31:49,185 --> 00:31:50,933
You know, I highly doubt that.

552
00:31:51,665 --> 00:31:54,408
But then I always did think
it was a long shot.

553
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:57,981
- Yes, sir.
- Didn't go well.

554
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,209
She's headed your way.

555
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:00,838
How do you want it to go down?

556
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:02,051
Make it public:

557
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,319
car-jacking.

558
00:32:03,407 --> 00:32:06,150
Corner of Region and Queen,
get her face on tape.

559
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:07,581
Understood.

560
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:10,179
What do you mean, car-jacking?

561
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:11,472
You're not gonna hurt her?

562
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:15,112
For every decision,

563
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,110
there's a consequence.

564
00:32:18,194 --> 00:32:19,903
Look, let's talk about this.

565
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:21,275
Decision...

566
00:32:26,724 --> 00:32:27,785
Consequence.

567
00:32:28,441 --> 00:32:29,456
Bitch.

568
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:31,860
Billy, where is she?

569
00:32:32,527 --> 00:32:33,536
Where is she?

570
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,395
What are you, crazy?

571
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:44,492
You OK? Come on.

572
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,363
Thanks.

573
00:33:48,766 --> 00:33:50,391
No, I owed you one.

574
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:52,646
Those men just tried to kill us.

575
00:33:53,592 --> 00:33:55,283
- Oh my God, Billy!
- He's fine.

576
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:56,804
We told him to leave town.

577
00:33:57,656 --> 00:33:59,024
Where do you think you're going?

578
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:00,295
We gotta move, man.

579
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:03,243
We gotta stay here and explain all this
when back-up gets here.

580
00:34:03,312 --> 00:34:05,341
Well, good luck with that.
Get in the car.

581
00:34:05,688 --> 00:34:07,437
I can't let you leave Hopper.

582
00:34:07,537 --> 00:34:08,908
Chad, what are you doing?

583
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:10,485
He just saved your life.

584
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:11,939
He's also a wanted fugitive.

585
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:14,035
What the hell is wrong with you?

586
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,863
He's innocent, it'll all sort itself out
down at the station.

587
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:18,262
- If not...
- If not?

588
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,281
What do you want to do?

589
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:30,473
I'm sorry, Chad.

590
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,969
We're leaving.

591
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:33,990
You're not gonna to stop us.

592
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,449
Let's go.

593
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:02,289
It should just take him two hours
before he finds and knows.

594
00:35:04,327 --> 00:35:05,334
You okay?

595
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:07,653
I should have trusted you.

596
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:11,173
I should have told you a long time ago.

597
00:35:13,302 --> 00:35:14,322
Told me...?

598
00:35:14,504 --> 00:35:15,567
About my dad.

599
00:35:16,649 --> 00:35:18,768
About how Chad and I
got caught up in all of this.

600
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:23,124
My dad was...

601
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:25,935
He drank.

602
00:35:27,029 --> 00:35:28,048
And when he got mean...

603
00:35:28,806 --> 00:35:30,063
He took it out on Billy.

604
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:31,486
And Billy...

605
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,265
fought back.

606
00:35:36,483 --> 00:35:37,506
I did.

607
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:40,510
Billy called me,

608
00:35:41,145 --> 00:35:42,159
scared.

609
00:35:43,581 --> 00:35:45,111
When I got to the house...

610
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:48,304
my dad had almost beaten him to death.

611
00:35:50,336 --> 00:35:52,501
I swear, he was gonna finish him off.

612
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:54,938
So I saw...

613
00:35:56,564 --> 00:35:58,206
this big flashlight...

614
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:04,250
I didn't think I hit him that hard...

615
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:09,998
You were protecting your brother.

616
00:36:10,077 --> 00:36:13,000
But we were so sure
that we were gonna go to jail.

617
00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:15,556
He already had a record so...

618
00:36:17,056 --> 00:36:19,394
we decided to get rid of the body
ourselves.

619
00:36:19,673 --> 00:36:21,203
That's when Buchalter pulled you over.

620
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:22,738
Yeah, I freaked out.

621
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:26,948
So I did the only thing
I could think of, I called Chad.

622
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:28,429
And he showed up...

623
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:30,895
And he talked to the cop and he...

624
00:36:32,505 --> 00:36:33,638
He took care of it.

625
00:36:37,435 --> 00:36:39,839
And I know how you feel
about your father.

626
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,344
Being a cop
and dying in the line of duty.

627
00:36:46,198 --> 00:36:48,499
How could I tell you what I did to mine?

628
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:53,174
Rita, I...

629
00:36:55,392 --> 00:36:56,405
My father...

630
00:37:00,294 --> 00:37:01,296
I lied.

631
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:04,658
My father...

632
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,046
killed himself.

633
00:37:07,195 --> 00:37:08,972
The line of duty things was just to...

634
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:11,899
To cover up.

635
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,423
I'm sorry.

636
00:37:29,927 --> 00:37:31,401
What are we gonna do?

637
00:37:33,805 --> 00:37:35,813
We can't just run from all of this.

638
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:41,291
You said Chad made it go away, right?

639
00:37:41,516 --> 00:37:42,614
How did he do that?

640
00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:44,553
Weren't you questioned by the police?

641
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,243
The people he delt with,
they arraigned some lawyer,

642
00:37:47,244 --> 00:37:48,643
some big shot attorney.

643
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:51,991
He came with me for the questioning,
and he just...

644
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:53,923
He just made it all go away.

645
00:37:53,964 --> 00:37:55,425
A defense attorney.

646
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:57,788
You remember what his name is?

647
00:37:58,205 --> 00:37:59,230
Sure.

648
00:37:59,312 --> 00:38:00,911
His name is Barry Coldburn.

649
00:38:01,408 --> 00:38:04,667
<i>I got you one of the best attorneys
in the state, Barry Coldburn.</i>

650
00:38:04,668 --> 00:38:06,900
You are now protected
under attorney-client privilege.

651
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:07,907
Take a plea.

652
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:09,683
I can probably get you murder II.

653
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:26,676
I have to say, Tobey...

654
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:30,553
When you screw up,
you swing for the fences.

655
00:38:30,987 --> 00:38:34,158
I can assure you
tomorrow will go just as planned.

656
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,424
How are you gonna pull that off?

657
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:39,991
Your two sheriffs, Fencik and Buchalter,
got hit today.

658
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:42,473
I can find replacements.

659
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,335
Do you realize what this could cost us,

660
00:38:45,336 --> 00:38:48,144
all these messes
I keep having to clean up?

661
00:38:48,645 --> 00:38:50,077
It's all under control.

662
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:53,393
This all started
when you couldn' t keep it in your pants

663
00:38:53,394 --> 00:38:54,706
for that mexican girl.

664
00:38:54,962 --> 00:38:58,060
And now, I'm trying to keep
the whole system from imploding.

665
00:38:58,061 --> 00:38:59,652
By tomorrow, you'll be back in control

666
00:38:59,653 --> 00:39:01,931
and we'll be moving on
to bigger and better things.

667
00:39:01,932 --> 00:39:04,293
Really? Detweiler is dead.

668
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,553
And who knows how much Hopper's learned.

669
00:39:06,593 --> 00:39:07,782
Not enough to hurt us.

670
00:39:07,897 --> 00:39:08,926
Not yet.

671
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:11,436
It's hard enough paining Garza
on Hopper.

672
00:39:11,878 --> 00:39:13,300
Now even that may not stick.

673
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:15,733
I'll make sure it sticks.

674
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:17,227
How?

675
00:39:18,993 --> 00:39:20,702
We still have our inside man.

676
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:32,404
So, is that the sealed warrant?

677
00:39:32,628 --> 00:39:33,859
No, I couldn't get it.

678
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:35,972
It's locked in judge Nitzberg's safe.

679
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:39,182
What's this?

680
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:40,823
I did get you this subpoena list though.

681
00:39:41,404 --> 00:39:43,416
Okay, I got it.

682
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:45,559
Booth, Detweiler,

683
00:39:45,777 --> 00:39:47,232
Damien, Garza.

684
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:49,557
Are these all tied to the same case?

685
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:52,861
I don't understand.
Why was Garza subpoenaed?

686
00:39:53,107 --> 00:39:54,126
He cut a deal.

687
00:39:54,755 --> 00:39:56,690
He's supposed to testify against Booth.

688
00:39:58,316 --> 00:39:59,884
Garza was dirty too.

689
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:03,904
Spivak?

690
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:05,150
You know who he is?

691
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:09,707
Detective Brett Hopper?

692
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,604
We've got the gun,
with your prints on it.

693
00:40:11,605 --> 00:40:13,993
I think you killed Garza...
... hit Shelten five times.

694
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,192
She was quite a looker.

695
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:17,265
Brett Hopper?
You're under arrest for the murder...

696
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:20,196
Brett Hopper you're under arrest for the
murder of Alberto Garza.

697
00:40:20,197 --> 00:40:21,831
... assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

698
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:23,646
The guy's running after me since Day 1.
