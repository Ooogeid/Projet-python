1
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,627
Drop the balls.

2
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:22,747
# Who's cooking monsters
in the kitchen?

3
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:28,147
# Who keeps a knife tucked
in the garden?

4
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:32,267
# Who keeps you nervous

5
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:36,267
# Like screaming motorcycles?

6
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:38,867
# You keep the fire burning

7
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:41,507
# I'll keep the water running... #

8
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:57,307
Take care, Luke.
Beware of something nasty

9
00:01:57,307 --> 00:01:59,547
pretending to be something nice.

10
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:22,495
How are you?

11
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:24,415
Feeling better.

12
00:02:26,535 --> 00:02:28,535
Sleeping? Not sleeping?

13
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:30,455
Talk to me.

14
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:35,415
I'm your personal physician,
remember. Rupert Galvin.

15
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:37,855
He isn't expensive.
That's the one.

16
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:39,935
I get nightmares.

17
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:42,655
Real shockers. I'm not kidding.

18
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:44,895
Go on.

19
00:02:44,895 --> 00:02:48,415
It's the same thing, over and over.

20
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:51,735
There's a car. It's crashed.

21
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:53,895
And a driver.

22
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:57,495
You don't seem him clearly,
but you know he's trapped.

23
00:02:57,495 --> 00:03:00,455
There's a kid
strapped into one of those seats.

24
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:03,375
He's in the back. Can't get out.

25
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,575
The guy in the front,
that's his dad.

26
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:08,895
Only his dad can't help him.

27
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:14,055
Galvin, what's happening to me?

28
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:17,615
The clown, Whoppo,

29
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,775
he was a pyromancer.

30
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:21,775
A Grade 7 entity.

31
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,855
They specialise in divination.

32
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:26,175
That's fortune-telling using fire.

33
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:28,295
Was it balls?
Correct.

34
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:31,055
Piss him off,
which we most certainly did,

35
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:34,295
and you get this intense burst
of psychic energy.

36
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:37,575
You took quite a hit. Anything else?

37
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:39,615
It's me.

38
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:41,575
I'm the kid. That's how it feels.

39
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,215
And there's something
watching in the shadows.

40
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:49,535
Why won't he help?

41
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:53,295
And then you wake up?

42
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:56,535
First I see Father Simeon.
Simeon? No wonder you feel bad!

43
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:02,855
So this guy watching the car,
any ideas? Is he important?

44
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:05,935
I never see him clearly,
but it feels like I should know him.

45
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:08,135
What do you think?

46
00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:12,455
You've had a close encounter
with a pyromancer, is what I think.

47
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:14,455
Will I get over it?
It'll pass.

48
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:19,295
In the meantime I'm taking you off
the frontline. Doctor's orders.

49
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:23,015
These...moments when you see Simeon,
does he say anything?

50
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:27,615
Yeah. he says,
"Beware of something nasty

51
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:30,495
pretending to be something nice."
He should know.

52
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:33,735
He's about as nasty as they come.

53
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:35,615
Look after yourself.

54
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:46,495
Mina.
'How is he?' Not great.

55
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,975
Did you level with him
about the pyromancer?

56
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:53,015
I told him enough. Listen,
I gotta go. I'll catch you later.

57
00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:55,935
Galvin, what are you up to?
'Nothing.'

58
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,455
Just off to see an old chum.

59
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:22,455
Something nasty
pretending to be something nice.

60
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:33,335
Anyone order a pizza?

61
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:40,015
Simeon, we need to talk about Luke.

62
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,935
Do you mind?
This is priceless Venetian.

63
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:47,055
So is this, my friend.

64
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,175
Quattro stagione.

65
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:52,735
You want some? You should,
you're looking kinda peaky.

66
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:55,455
Just get on with it.
I haven't got all day.

67
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,135
That some Persian calligraphy?

68
00:05:58,135 --> 00:06:00,615
OK. Let me tell you.

69
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:05,655
Young Luke had a bit of a set to
with a pyromancer.

70
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:08,495
Now he's started seeing things.
Hardly surprising.

71
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:10,615
No.

72
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:13,455
One of the things
he's started seeing is you.

73
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:16,335
Ah. So that's it.

74
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:20,015
You're afraid the boy will come
to me and I'll tell him what I know.

75
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:24,895
What do you know, Simeon?
Many, many things.

76
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:27,655
Everything and nothing.
Give me the package.

77
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:33,055
Jay left a package with you
in trust for Luke.

78
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:36,375
What if he did? Why would I give it
to a vulgarian like you?

79
00:06:38,255 --> 00:06:40,735
I love you, too, Simeon.
The package.

80
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:44,095
You're afraid, Galvin,
and possibly ashamed.

81
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:47,655
As well you might be.
Me? Nothing to be ashamed of.

82
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:50,255
A matter of opinion.

83
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:52,255
You know...

84
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:54,735
I've often wondered how you managed

85
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:57,175
to keep it together
for so many years.

86
00:06:57,175 --> 00:07:02,015
Every other zombie I've met managed
to survive a couple of months tops.

87
00:07:02,015 --> 00:07:05,215
Must be something to do
with the environment in here.

88
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:08,615
Clean and dry.

89
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:12,375
Temperature and humidity

90
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,335
constantly controlled.

91
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,815
Is that what you like?

92
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,695
You barbarian!

93
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:28,055
You mindless vandal.

94
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:32,775
The package, Simeon.

95
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:42,095
Can I make you something else?

96
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,095
No. I'm not hungry thanks.

97
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:46,255
I don't care what Rupert says,

98
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:48,415
I'm calling the doctor.
I don't need one.

99
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:52,015
Come here. Sit down.

100
00:07:52,015 --> 00:07:54,455
Can we talk?

101
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:56,455
Yeah.

102
00:07:58,215 --> 00:08:00,215
The accident,

103
00:08:00,215 --> 00:08:03,495
when Dad died, was I with him?

104
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:08,775
Come on, Mum. You have to tell me.

105
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,655
What happened?

106
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:15,855
It was a college reunion.

107
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:18,895
Dad said, "Go. Why not?"

108
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:22,135
I didn't like the idea.

109
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:26,175
Anyway I went.

110
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:28,815
And Dad had a business trip?

111
00:08:28,815 --> 00:08:32,575
Yeah. And he was driving.

112
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:36,015
I don't know why I agreed.

113
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,295
I could have lost you, too.

114
00:08:38,295 --> 00:08:42,095
Mum, don't be so hard on yourself.
Come on.

115
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,615
'Hello, Luke.

116
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:15,655
This is very strange for me.
I'm talking to you out there,

117
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,375
and yet I've got you
right here in my arms.

118
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,455
If you're watching, it means
we never got to know each other.

119
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:23,615
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

120
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:30,975
Everything you see around you
is yours. Use it wisely.

121
00:09:33,295 --> 00:09:35,975
Good luck, Luke.
The time has come to act.

122
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:41,575
There are dragons out there.
I wish I could keep you safe.

123
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,455
The best I can do is warn you.

124
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:56,295
Those that offer friendship
will not always be what they seem.

125
00:09:56,295 --> 00:10:00,215
Beware of something nasty
pretending to be something nice.'

126
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,615
What's this?

127
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,735
The unedited version of Jay's tape.

128
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:29,895
What am I supposed to do with it?
Keep it for me away from Luke.

129
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,735
Sure you're doing the right thing?
No.

130
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:35,015
But it's my call. So keep it safe.

131
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:49,215
Me and Galvin chased a clown
who wasn't a clown but a pyromancer.

132
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,775
I got hit with one of his balls.
Not seriously. God forbid!

133
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:54,935
After that I had nightmares.

134
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:57,335
I kept seeing my dad,
who's dead obviously.

135
00:10:57,335 --> 00:11:00,175
I'm like maybe I'm going
a little crazy. You would.

136
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:03,575
I can see that.
That's why we're seeing Fr Simeon.

137
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:07,815
I can see a pattern. It's all
falling into place. It's brilliant.

138
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:11,175
It's like the Da Vinci Code.
Really? That brilliant?

139
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:13,295
Well, in many ways it was brilliant.

140
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:19,455
Should we knock or something?

141
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:25,735
That has never happened before.

142
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:30,295
Big wow.

143
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:39,615
He said to beware of something nasty
pretending to be something nice.

144
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,655
Know who he was talking about?

145
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:44,815
Galvin. He was talking about Galvin.

146
00:11:44,815 --> 00:11:48,135
I'd better know
what you're thinking. Bet you don't.

147
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:53,495
What's the connection between Galvin
and Fr Simeon, right? Luke.

148
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:59,895
I think I've found Father Simeon.

149
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,295
He's dead.

150
00:12:03,295 --> 00:12:05,455
Don't worry. That's how he is.
It's normal.

151
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:07,375
No. Not like this.

152
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:34,809
It was you. You killed him
to stop him talking to me.

153
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:38,009
Earl Grey, China, or mint?
You heard this? No builder's.

154
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:43,009
Mina's a bit exotic. Simeon passed
on or out and I'm responsible?

155
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:45,689
Murder. Let's call it
by its name Galvin.

156
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:49,249
You killed him.
I'll bring teabags and hot water.

157
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:52,209
It's not murder.
Simeon's been dead for years.

158
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:55,249
Don't be clever. He was silenced
to stop him talking.

159
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:58,809
It's the logical explanation.
Mina, explain to him.

160
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:01,809
Zombies take herbal crap
to stop rotting away.

161
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:05,249
It's an unbalanced existence.
He may have got his doses wrong.

162
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:07,489
He was murdered.
You don't know that. By you.

163
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:11,329
Give me a break! Calm down.
All we know is Simeon's dead.

164
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:15,089
It's not for the first time.
Lighten up. Have a cup of tea.

165
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:17,249
Come on, Ruby. We're going.

166
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:36,649
I'm not your girlfriend.

167
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,369
So?
So treat me with a bit more respect.

168
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:41,529
I'm your friend-friend.

169
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,289
I'm trying really hard to understand
what you're going through.

170
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:47,209
Are you?
Yes.

171
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,329
We all are.

172
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,849
But you're not exactly
making it easy.

173
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:54,649
Galvin and Mina
are in this together.

174
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:56,649
I can't trust them.

175
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,609
Can I trust you?

176
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:01,769
Of course you can.

177
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:03,649
You know you can.

178
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:07,289
I know.

179
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:09,249
Thanks.

180
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:19,569
Excuse me, I've a message

181
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:22,329
for one of the residents.
I can't see the name.

182
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:25,049
These wee tags are very fiddly.
Who is it?

183
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:28,209
It's Mr Van Helsing.

184
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,369
Mr Luke Van Helsing.

185
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,649
Karen Speedwell, the Happy Medium.

186
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:36,409
It's tacky, but the punters like it.

187
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:40,249
I know what you're thinking,
not my scene.

188
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:44,569
You've never had any experience
of the other side, have you?

189
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:46,489
As a matter of fact -
Of course not.

190
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,649
This is loft-style living.

191
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:51,889
Why would you buy
anything I'm selling? Face it.

192
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:55,489
I could be something nasty
pretending to be something nice.

193
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:03,329
Sorry to throw that at you.
That was Jay. He said that.

194
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:06,049
Jay Van Helsing was my dad.
Not was, dear.

195
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:08,809
Is. They live on.

196
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,689
What else did he say?

197
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:13,969
Well, he said you were unhappy.

198
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:16,129
He said you weren't well.

199
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:19,409
And if you don't mind me saying so
I think he was right.

200
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,569
What else? Tell me please.

201
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:24,929
Not now. I'm doing sessions
at the Town Hall.

202
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:27,929
Come along. I'm there all week.
Try the tea cakes.

203
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:31,129
Just kidding.

204
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,929
I'll see myself out.

205
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:49,409
There you are. He's coming.
That's what you wanted.

206
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:52,289
And while we're about it

207
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:55,409
keep that thing where it belongs,
gives me the willies.

208
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:57,929
What do you want with the boy?
What's he to you?

209
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,289
A soul in torment, Karen.

210
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:06,809
It's my sacred duty
to help him find peace.

211
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:09,969
You're up to something.
I only wish I knew what it was.

212
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:14,009
A good deed
in a naughty world, Karen.

213
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:16,209
It shines out.

214
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,369
You'd be amazed
at the joy it brings.

215
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:24,329
Where are we going now?
There's someone I want you to see.

216
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:26,489
Will he be alive?

217
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:29,449
She's a medium. She found me.
It was amazing.

218
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:32,169
Total stranger,
said she had a message for me.

219
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:35,809
What was the message?
Dunno. She wouldn't say.

220
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:39,049
Karen Speedwell, The Happy Medium.

221
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:40,969
What?
Nothing.

222
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:44,009
Just do it.

223
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:48,369
I've got something coming through
for Mabel, is it?

224
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:51,449
Or perhaps Maude.

225
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:53,409
Let me see. It's not very clear.

226
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:58,049
Anyone here got
a name beginning with M?

227
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:02,609
Maureen.
Quite possibly.

228
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:07,129
Maureen, yes.
I have a message from a man.

229
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:09,689
Big fella. Not bad-looking.
Jack.

230
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,729
That's him. Jack says,
"Are you looking after the garden?"

231
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:17,289
Garden? Does he mean the allotment?

232
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:19,689
The allotment, yes.

233
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:23,329
He wants you to water
the runner beans.

234
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:26,289
Jack never grew runner beans.

235
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:30,089
No, but he wants you
to plant them first.

236
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:33,849
Will you do that? That would make
him very happy.

237
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:35,769
Please!

238
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,649
There's something else
coming through.

239
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,289
It's you. What do you want?

240
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:50,049
Luke?

241
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:52,769
Here.
It's Jay.

242
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:56,409
He knows how you felt all those
years ago the day of the accident.

243
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:00,409
He says too much has been hidden
for too long.

244
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:02,369
He wants you to know the truth. Ah!

245
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:15,209
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

246
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:17,769
That's all for this afternoon.

247
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:20,129
Please excuse me.

248
00:18:22,729 --> 00:18:25,209
Karen. Karen!

249
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:28,729
Karen. Are you all right?
You seemed a bit shaken up.

250
00:18:28,729 --> 00:18:32,489
Well, your man Jay takes
no prisoners. I have to see you.

251
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:35,009
Yes.

252
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:37,649
Come to the house tomorrow.

253
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,809
In the morning.

254
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:43,609
No offence, Luke,
but you should come on your own.

255
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:47,289
I sense your little friend
may be less than simpatico.

256
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:49,609
Am I right? See you tomorrow.

257
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:52,969
Not too early.
I've got a migraine coming on.

258
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:03,249
I can't believe it.

259
00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:07,209
What? With all you know
you fall for that load of tosh!

260
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:09,329
How did she know my dad's name?

261
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:11,569
You probably told her.

262
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:15,249
Luke, it's all an act.

263
00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:17,569
"He wants you to plant them first."

264
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:20,049
I mean, honestly!

265
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:24,089
It's easy to mock, but the way
things are she's all I've got.

266
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:27,849
Are you serious? I'd say
she's the only one I can trust.

267
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:33,129
In that case
I feel sorry for you, Luke.

268
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:35,249
See you around.

269
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:13,089
By the power
of the moon and the stars

270
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:15,649
by the air above
and the waters beneath

271
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:20,809
by the powers thou mayest not refuse
so do I summon thee.

272
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,049
For pity's sake, woman,

273
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:26,889
what is it?
Can't you do anything by yourself?

274
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:30,049
The boy's arriving now.
You promised you'd be here.

275
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:33,689
And here I am. Don't panic.

276
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:36,849
I told you
I'm not doing this on my own.

277
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:41,929
Now...

278
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:45,569
..do I have your full attention?

279
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:47,489
Lovely.

280
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:53,249
The boy will come.
You will do what you do.

281
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:56,169
I will do what I do.

282
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:58,329
When we've finished

283
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:01,889
he'll be a much happier
and a wiser lad.

284
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:04,769
Nothing could be simpler.
DOORBELL RINGS

285
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:07,889
Right then. Are we a team?

286
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:10,169
Excellent.

287
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,049
It's showtime.

288
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:24,609
Luke.

289
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:26,729
Welcome. Look at you.

290
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:28,609
Come in.

291
00:21:47,449 --> 00:21:49,369
Ah!

292
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:58,729
JAY's VOICE: Luke.

293
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:02,529
Luke, my son.

294
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:06,569
I've waited so long
to speak with you.

295
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:08,489
Dad?

296
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:11,689
Is that really you?

297
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:13,969
You must have many questions.

298
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,969
Yeah.

299
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:29,689
What's it like where you are?
You mean death?

300
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:33,849
It's very flat. At first
I thought it was like Nebraska.

301
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:36,849
But I was wrong.
It's nothing like Nebraska.

302
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:39,209
Being dead is like nothing at all.

303
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:42,769
She's getting tired.
We must be quick.

304
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:45,009
Luke, you are in great danger.

305
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:47,969
Rupert Galvin is from the half life

306
00:22:47,969 --> 00:22:52,049
and is plotting to kill you
as he once killed me.

307
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,529
It was an accident.
It was a car crash.

308
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:57,609
Staged by Galvin
to protect his Half Life friends.

309
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:01,249
He was my murderer.
Don't let him be yours.

310
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:09,809
Beware of something nasty
pretending to be something nice.

311
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:11,969
Swear on the token
I gave you as a child.

312
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:15,489
Swear on the cross of St Luke
when I send you the means

313
00:23:15,489 --> 00:23:18,609
you will kill Galvin, do you swear?

314
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:20,689
I swear.

315
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:23,169
What do you want me to do?

316
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:27,089
Watch and wait. One day soon
I'll send you a messenger.

317
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:30,049
Someone who'll bring you
the means to destroy him.

318
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:35,129
Go now. We'll talk again.

319
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:53,529
He's gone.

320
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:57,569
Did he get what he wanted?
I'm sure he did.

321
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:01,609
JAY's VOICE: I'd say we gave him
plenty to think about.

322
00:24:18,505 --> 00:24:21,465
What'll it be?
A word.

323
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:24,625
A young associate of mine

324
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:28,705
had a bit of a run in
with a pyromancer. So I heard.

325
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:31,465
What else have you heard, Sandy?
N-n-n...

326
00:24:31,465 --> 00:24:35,465
How about we miss the bit
where you say nothing

327
00:24:35,465 --> 00:24:38,385
and go to where you tell me
what I want to hear?

328
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:41,705
He's been talking to a medium.
Karen something.

329
00:24:41,705 --> 00:24:44,505
Half Life?

330
00:24:46,025 --> 00:24:49,665
Human.
Who's she working with?

331
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:51,825
I don't know, Mr Galvin, I swear.

332
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,745
Do you want me t-to...find out?

333
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,105
I'd consider that a favour, Sandy.

334
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:01,865
Sandy, please wait till I've gone.

335
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:19,105
Luke, is that you?

336
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:23,745
I thought
you were supposed to be on leave.

337
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:28,025
Not necessary.
I've never felt better.

338
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:34,145
So tell me
about this Karen Speedwell.

339
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:38,785
A woman like that has to be a fake.
What could she do for you?

340
00:25:38,785 --> 00:25:42,625
She's already done it.
Arranged a face to face with my dad.

341
00:25:44,265 --> 00:25:47,465
It was fascinating.
I learned all kinds of things.

342
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:56,865
Professor Rupert E Galvin.

343
00:25:56,865 --> 00:26:00,225
Out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
May I?

344
00:26:01,465 --> 00:26:03,945
Just a second.
I don't know you, do I?

345
00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:06,905
No, ma'am, but I know you.
Your fame goes before you.

346
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:09,065
I'm a psychic researcher.

347
00:26:09,065 --> 00:26:11,665
I'm studying
the UK's top clairvoyants.

348
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:14,545
Trying to get a feel
for how you all do what you do.

349
00:26:14,545 --> 00:26:19,185
This the consultation suite?
Thank you so much. Hold your horses!

350
00:26:19,185 --> 00:26:22,905
What a pretty room. There's such
a thing as a professional code.

351
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:27,265
Let's not be coy, Ms Speedwell.

352
00:26:27,265 --> 00:26:29,705
You and I are in the same business.

353
00:26:29,705 --> 00:26:32,305
So why not relax
and let it all hang out.

354
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:36,185
My gifts are a mystery
entirely beyond my control.

355
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:38,305
I'm a mere vessel, a channel

356
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:42,265
through which my spirit guide
gives succour to troubled souls.

357
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:44,185
Fascinating.

358
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:49,785
Do you think you could rustle up
this...spirit of yours?

359
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:52,145
Maybe we could chew the fat.

360
00:26:52,145 --> 00:26:55,745
Shoot the breeze. What do you say?
Out of the question.

361
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:58,185
He's self-effacing.
He shuns the limelight.

362
00:26:58,185 --> 00:27:00,745
I'll bet he does.

363
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:03,825
You know what this is?

364
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:07,825
This won't harm you physically,
no, ma'am.

365
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:11,265
But the electromagnetic pulse
right here, you see?

366
00:27:11,265 --> 00:27:15,025
That'll fry
your psychic nerve ends permanently.

367
00:27:15,025 --> 00:27:17,225
I think you know what I'm saying.

368
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:19,625
You're not a real researcher.

369
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:22,145
Bye-bye, ghosties. Hello, welfare.

370
00:27:22,145 --> 00:27:24,985
Call him. Now.

371
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:32,145
By the power of the moon and stars
by air above and waters beneath

372
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:36,825
by the power thou mayest not refuse,
Mr T, I summon thee.

373
00:27:36,825 --> 00:27:39,825
What now, you stupid cow?

374
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,585
Can't you manage
on your own for five...

375
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:46,425
Oh, no. Gladiolus Thrip,
I thought you were -

376
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:50,425
Why are you not dead?
Mr Galvin, don't be like that.

377
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:53,185
Talk, you festering plug
of drain slime.

378
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:55,305
Festering plug of drain slime!

379
00:27:55,305 --> 00:27:59,665
That's more like it.
Lovely turn of phrase, eh, Karen?

380
00:27:59,665 --> 00:28:01,905
What are you up to?

381
00:28:01,905 --> 00:28:05,505
What lies are you telling Luke?
Lies! Hear that, Karen?

382
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:08,665
Now we get pilloried
for a simple act of charity.

383
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:12,585
Putting the boy in touch
with his dear dead dad.

384
00:28:12,585 --> 00:28:16,425
If you try to turn him against me,
I'll rend you in pieces.

385
00:28:16,425 --> 00:28:19,025
Oh, no, Mr Galvin,
violence won't help.

386
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:23,425
In fact if I might say so
violence is half your problem.

387
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:27,225
The violence of the past
rising up like sewer gas.

388
00:28:27,225 --> 00:28:30,905
You topped the boy's father,
didn't you?

389
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:34,865
You killed him stone dead. Go on.

390
00:28:34,865 --> 00:28:38,185
Tell me I'm a liar.
And now he knows.

391
00:28:38,185 --> 00:28:42,145
So the game's up. The chickens
have come home to roost.

392
00:28:42,145 --> 00:28:44,625
Festering plug of drain slime!

393
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,905
Very good.
I must write that one down.

394
00:28:52,385 --> 00:28:54,585
'Those that offer you friendship

395
00:28:54,585 --> 00:28:57,025
will not always be what they seem.

396
00:28:57,025 --> 00:29:00,745
Beware of something nasty
pretending to be something nice.

397
00:29:00,745 --> 00:29:05,225
Those that offer friendship will not
always be what they seem.' Luke!

398
00:29:05,225 --> 00:29:08,785
'Those that offer friendship will
not always be what they seem.'

399
00:29:08,785 --> 00:29:11,585
If you're in here, we need to talk.

400
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:16,665
'Those that offer friendship
will not always be what they seem.

401
00:29:16,665 --> 00:29:18,705
Beware of something nasty - '

402
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:21,745
I've been to see Karen Speedwell.

403
00:29:21,745 --> 00:29:23,665
Her spirit guide was Thrip.

404
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:28,065
He's a bounty hunter, you know that?

405
00:29:28,065 --> 00:29:32,385
The Half Life paid him to turn
you and me against each other.

406
00:29:36,345 --> 00:29:38,425
It was a trick.

407
00:29:38,425 --> 00:29:41,185
You were never talking to Jay.

408
00:29:46,905 --> 00:29:49,785
Do you recognise it

409
00:29:49,785 --> 00:29:52,265
The sign of St Luke.

410
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:56,905
Given to me by my dad
at my christening.

411
00:29:56,905 --> 00:29:59,825
Check it out with Simeon.

412
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:03,705
Wait. What am I saying? That's
if you hadn't killed him, too.

413
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:06,305
Don't I even get to tell
my side of the story?

414
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,145
Yes. Start talking.

415
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:11,425
It was an accident.

416
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:16,625
The car went off the road.
Jay was unconscious.

417
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,705
There was nothing I could do.

418
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:20,625
It was you.

419
00:30:21,985 --> 00:30:23,985
The one in the shadows.

420
00:30:23,985 --> 00:30:26,705
You were there. You left him.

421
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:29,025
There was nothing I could do.

422
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:31,065
Nothing you could do?

423
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:33,145
Or nothing you would do?

424
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:35,265
Jay was my best friend.

425
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:38,305
That is the truth.
You have to believe me.

426
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:40,225
No, I don't.

427
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:43,265
Not anymore.

428
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:48,385
From now on I go my own way.

429
00:30:50,025 --> 00:30:52,265
Are you quitting on me?

430
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:54,385
I wouldn't say that.

431
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:57,225
I'd say I was keeping
the faith with my dad.

432
00:30:57,225 --> 00:31:01,625
Remember, denial is not an option.

433
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:04,465
Other people have a choice.
You have a destiny.

434
00:31:05,785 --> 00:31:08,625
You're the last Van Helsing.

435
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:37,385
Ssh. Calm down.

436
00:32:37,385 --> 00:32:39,705
What are you doing here?

437
00:32:39,705 --> 00:32:41,865
Nothing, I swear.

438
00:32:41,865 --> 00:32:44,945
Milk of human kindness.
You're not human.

439
00:32:44,945 --> 00:32:46,945
Figure of speech.

440
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:49,865
I was worried about you, boy.

441
00:32:49,865 --> 00:32:52,785
The brush with the pyromancer,
nasty business.

442
00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:55,065
My spies tell me you got splashed.

443
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:57,505
Given you the heebie jeebies,
has it?

444
00:32:57,505 --> 00:33:01,025
Skeleton's crawling out of
your cupboard, that type of thing?

445
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:04,065
I'm fine. Keep your bony nose
out of my business.

446
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,385
Don't push it, lad.
You're not up to it.

447
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,425
Look at you.
You're in a right old state.

448
00:33:10,425 --> 00:33:13,625
Nothing like a pyromancer
for a good clean out.

449
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,305
But like you say,
none of my business.

450
00:33:16,305 --> 00:33:18,305
Here...

451
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:20,705
got a little prezzie for you.

452
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:22,785
What's that?

453
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:24,945
Where did you get it?

454
00:33:24,945 --> 00:33:26,985
Well, it ain't a bunch of daffs.

455
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:29,305
And I didn't get it down Tesco's.

456
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:31,785
Not even in these troubled times.

457
00:33:31,785 --> 00:33:35,185
The fella who gave it me
said it was a means to an end,

458
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:37,145
and you'd know what to do.

459
00:33:45,505 --> 00:33:48,105
Steady, tiger,
don't shoot the messenger.

460
00:33:48,105 --> 00:33:50,265
Tell you what,

461
00:33:50,265 --> 00:33:52,505
I'll leave you to it.

462
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:55,825
Give my best to Mr Galvin.

463
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,425
He's often in my thoughts.

464
00:34:08,585 --> 00:34:11,345
DOORBELL RINGS

465
00:34:24,225 --> 00:34:26,105
Hi.

466
00:34:31,065 --> 00:34:32,945
Sorry about the other day.

467
00:34:34,345 --> 00:34:36,425
Don't worry. It's not a problem.

468
00:34:36,425 --> 00:34:39,305
Thanks. I said the wrong things.

469
00:34:39,305 --> 00:34:41,265
It's not a problem really.

470
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:46,025
So what about Galvin?

471
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:48,145
What about him?

472
00:34:49,345 --> 00:34:51,825
He's not
my all-time favourite person,

473
00:34:51,825 --> 00:34:55,305
but you and him not talking
doesn't feel right.

474
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:57,505
I don't like it.
You don't?

475
00:34:57,505 --> 00:35:00,825
I'm supposed
to care about that, am I?

476
00:35:00,825 --> 00:35:04,665
OK. Don't start. Whatever's
between me and Galvin I'll sort it.

477
00:35:04,665 --> 00:35:07,825
In my own time and in my own way.

478
00:35:07,825 --> 00:35:11,345
You cool with that?
Yeah.

479
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:13,265
Good.

480
00:35:22,785 --> 00:35:25,905
Our Happy Medium has clearly sent
him over the edge.

481
00:35:25,905 --> 00:35:27,785
I've never seen him
like this before.

482
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:29,985
He's gone... I don't know.

483
00:35:29,985 --> 00:35:31,785
Screwy?
Yeah. Totally.

484
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:36,785
Hello.

485
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:40,225
Karen?

486
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:46,945
Hello?

487
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:50,985
Mina.

488
00:35:50,985 --> 00:35:54,065
I don't think our medium's
quite so happy anymore.

489
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:10,345
Aaaagh!

490
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:12,825
It's Thrip.
Thrip?

491
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:14,905
What the hell's he doing here?

492
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:17,145
He told Luke to kill Galvin.

493
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:19,065
What do we do now?

494
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:39,068
Galvin.

495
00:36:39,068 --> 00:36:41,308
We need to meet up.

496
00:36:41,308 --> 00:36:43,228
Get a few things straight.

497
00:37:26,868 --> 00:37:28,788
He's leaving.

498
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:55,508
Luke.

499
00:38:02,028 --> 00:38:04,028
Is that it, Mr Galvin?

500
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:06,188
Don't make me laugh.

501
00:38:06,188 --> 00:38:10,308
You hear this, Thrippy,
you miserable scab of puke,

502
00:38:10,308 --> 00:38:15,428
go anywhere near the boy
and I will personally rend thee.

503
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:17,828
I wouldn't want that.

504
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,348
No, indeed,
I've seen you rending, Mr Galvin.

505
00:38:20,348 --> 00:38:24,268
That's something
I'd be very keen to avoid.

506
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:30,428
Bracing.

507
00:38:30,428 --> 00:38:33,988
Now remember what happens next?

508
00:38:33,988 --> 00:38:36,348
It's my turn.
No, it's not.

509
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:38,268
It's my turn.

510
00:38:54,588 --> 00:38:56,788
That phrase keeps coming back.

511
00:38:56,788 --> 00:38:59,228
Something nasty
pretending to be something nice.

512
00:38:59,228 --> 00:39:01,388
The car was on fire.

513
00:39:01,388 --> 00:39:04,388
I had to choose
between you and your father.

514
00:39:04,388 --> 00:39:07,588
You could have gone back for him.

515
00:39:07,588 --> 00:39:10,668
You could have tried.
Perhaps.

516
00:39:10,668 --> 00:39:13,988
But you didn't. You betrayed him.

517
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:18,068
Your father betrayed you, Luke.

518
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:20,668
Galvin saved your life.

519
00:39:20,668 --> 00:39:25,548
Your father was on the verge
of going over to the Half Life.

520
00:39:25,548 --> 00:39:30,748
For him future lay in raising
hybrids: half human, half entity

521
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:33,988
So what? You're a hybrid.
That's different.

522
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:36,268
I made my choices
and paid the price.

523
00:39:36,268 --> 00:39:38,388
Jay was reckless.

524
00:39:38,388 --> 00:39:41,468
He was prepared to sacrifice
anything, even you.

525
00:39:41,468 --> 00:39:45,348
You're lying. He was going
to let you be brought up by them.

526
00:39:46,788 --> 00:39:49,268
You'd never have seen Jenny again.

527
00:39:49,268 --> 00:39:51,948
So you stopped him
by letting him die.

528
00:39:53,068 --> 00:39:55,668
No.

529
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:58,228
He stopped him by saving you.

530
00:39:58,228 --> 00:40:00,988
If this is true,
why has he never told me?

531
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:03,588
He didn't want you to know.

532
00:40:03,588 --> 00:40:08,268
In spite of everything he wanted you
to think well of your father.

533
00:40:12,988 --> 00:40:15,948
Marvellous. Marvellous.

534
00:40:15,948 --> 00:40:19,508
I don't know whether
to throw flowers or throw up.

535
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:22,508
Come on, son,
finish him for Gawd's sake.

536
00:40:22,508 --> 00:40:26,748
Do one thing right.
Make your old man proud. Luke!

537
00:40:26,748 --> 00:40:30,708
Don't listen to him. Karen's dead.

538
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:34,828
He killed her like he killed Simeon
to turn you against each other.

539
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:37,148
I don't believe you.
Course not.

540
00:40:38,388 --> 00:40:41,548
I am but a humble messenger.
So cut the crap

541
00:40:41,548 --> 00:40:44,228
and get on with it.

542
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:46,468
A humble messenger!

543
00:40:46,468 --> 00:40:48,588
There's only one way to find out.

544
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:54,508
Mina!

545
00:40:59,268 --> 00:41:02,548
Aaaagh!

546
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:05,188
Trip.

547
00:41:05,188 --> 00:41:08,548
We are one, you and I.

548
00:41:08,548 --> 00:41:11,588
I know thee,
and I call thee by thy name.

549
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:14,268
Vampire. Aaaagh!

550
00:41:24,308 --> 00:41:26,028
Aaaagh!

551
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:28,628
Aaaaaagh!

552
00:41:49,628 --> 00:41:52,588
This is the uncut version
of your dad's tape.

553
00:41:52,588 --> 00:41:57,108
'There are dragons out there.
I wish I could keep you safe.

554
00:41:57,108 --> 00:42:01,428
Those who offer friendship
will not always be what they seem.

555
00:42:01,428 --> 00:42:04,988
Beware of something nasty
pretending to be something nice.

556
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:13,068
And don't always assume the worst

557
00:42:13,068 --> 00:42:14,988
of those who don't understand.

558
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:19,068
I used to be the enemy,
the Half Life.

559
00:42:20,188 --> 00:42:22,268
But over the years...

560
00:42:22,268 --> 00:42:25,028
I've learned to walk
a different road.

561
00:42:25,468 --> 00:42:30,028
The future lies in the Half Life
and the human working as one.

562
00:42:32,388 --> 00:42:35,188
That's why I'm giving you
to them, Luke.

563
00:42:35,188 --> 00:42:37,588
One day...

564
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:41,148
you'll be the shining example
of the dawn of a new era.'

565
00:42:44,468 --> 00:42:47,828
'One day I hope
your mother will forgive me.'

566
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:15,148
You pulled me
out of the burning car.

567
00:43:15,148 --> 00:43:18,268
Whatever happened between you
and my dad's in the past.

568
00:43:18,268 --> 00:43:20,308
Let's leave it there, shall we?

569
00:43:23,028 --> 00:43:24,748
Good for me.

570
00:43:30,348 --> 00:43:32,508
Where's Mina? I owe her big time.

571
00:43:33,628 --> 00:43:35,828
Mina has issues.

572
00:43:35,828 --> 00:43:39,868
Issues that are going
to take some time to resolve.
