1
00:00:08,056 --> 00:00:10,416
- Hey, where are you going?
- Just over there.

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:12,376
They're all right.
We're all right.

3
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:13,627
See?

4
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:15,744
Well, don't go too far.

5
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,976
Ally, you're in charge!

6
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:35,723
Are we stealing?

7
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,896
Not if we say a prayer.

8
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:50,976
What is it?

9
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:11,216
What's the matter? Where's Ally?

10
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:14,656
Madge, where's Ally?

11
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:16,696
She's gone.

12
00:01:16,696 --> 00:01:18,616
She went with the angel.

13
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:22,456
Ally!

14
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,736
Ally?

15
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,736
Ally!

16
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:28,656
Ally!

17
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:30,820
Oh, god, Mark! Where is she?

18
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:33,856
I told you, the angel
took her up to heaven.

22
00:02:20,777 --> 00:02:23,256
OK, no problem. No harm done.

23
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,056
You're doing good, bud.

24
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:39,429
Makiwara.

25
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,856
 A centuries old
martial arts device.

26
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:43,976
All striking points may be used.

27
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:46,430
Knees, elbows, feet, hands.

28
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:48,296
The whole enchilada.

29
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:49,965
Correct.

30
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:54,384
Purpose - to train a warrior
mentally as well as physically.

31
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:57,016
Kuma San.

32
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:09,850
It's a modern twist to record the
number of blows landed in a second.

33
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:11,896
Thank you, Kuma San.

34
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:19,496
Remember, the whole enchilada.
Mind and body.

35
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,376
The whole enchilada.

36
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,132
Work on it.

37
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:42,456
One more time.

38
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:03,739
Your daddy was quick.
Best I ever saw.

39
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:04,925
You may just have the edge on him.

40
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:06,669
- But?
- Excuse me?

41
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:08,436
There's a but coming. I can tell.

42
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:12,390
For you, the physical stuff is easy.
It's the rest that's hard.

43
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:15,019
- Like what?
- Like it never lets up for a second.

44
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:18,391
You think I can't hack it.
I don't know. Some can't.

45
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:21,018
Remember, the job has to come first.

46
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,976
That's where the rubber
hits the road.

47
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,376
Yeah. Well, I'm going home
to take a shower.

48
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:28,816
Every single time, Luke.
It's the only way.

49
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:34,415
Hi, there.

50
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:36,345
What time did you go out?

51
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:38,531
I don't know. Early. About six?

52
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,276
I thought I didn't hear you.

53
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,858
Oh, Terry called.
Your test's been confirmed.

54
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:46,067
He wants to get a lesson in first,
so will you call him.

55
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,765
Too much, you know.

56
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:52,576
College, driving lessons,
and all this training.

57
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:54,896
- With Rupert?
- Yes.

58
00:04:54,896 --> 00:04:58,376
Yeah, well, he ought to be careful.
All that exercise.

59
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,536
Not as young as he was.

60
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:03,255
Don't worry about Galvin. He doesn't
exactly knock himself out.

61
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,656
- Here.
- No, thanks. No time.

62
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:08,325
- Make time.
- Sorry, I've got to get a shower.

63
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,139
Stay away from me, you vultures!

64
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:25,001
She's just a child!
What's the matter with you?!

65
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:27,489
What was all that about?

66
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,350
I can't do this, Mark.

67
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,699
First, the police asking questions,
and now that lot.

68
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:35,296
?? They'll get fed up
and go and bother someone else.

69
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:38,421
They think it's us.
You do know that, don't you?

70
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:42,560
Hey, your mum's just upset.

71
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,118
We'll find Ally.
Don't you worry, Princess.

72
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:49,056
She's with the angel. The lovely
angel took her up to heaven.

73
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,980
Please stop her saying that.

74
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:54,096
Please stop her saying that!

75
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:04,256
Luke, hey! Where do we meet you?

76
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:05,143
Sorry, you've lost me.

77
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:07,888
Jamie. You promised to take him out.

78
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:10,911
On account of how he thinks you're
wonderful. And it's his birthday.

79
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,004
And your mum and dad
have stitched you up again.

80
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:15,795
Jamie is my little brother,
not a stitch-up!

81
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,576
Yes, he is. Anyway, I can't. Sorry.

82
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:22,028
I have to tell you
you're letting down a child.

83
00:06:22,052 --> 00:06:25,656
A small person
who strangely hero-worships you.

84
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:28,776
I am shocked, Luke.
Shocked and saddened.

85
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:32,936
You can bring him
to play at the flat.

86
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:34,866
And what about your Xbox?

87
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,376
No, he'll trash it.

88
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:38,332
- He won't.
- He trashes everything.

89
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:42,355
Look, whatever. Just don't expect me
to be around. I've got things to do.

90
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,124
Course you have. I know that.

91
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,217
First rule of Fight Club.
Don't worry, I'm cool.

92
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,705
- What have we got?
- Little girls.

93
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,775
Ally and Madge Dunelm.

94
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:58,576
Two go for a walk,
but only one comes back.

95
00:06:58,576 --> 00:07:00,380
So how can we help?

96
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:02,287
Madge says they saw an angel.

97
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:04,856
And the angel took her sister
up to heaven.

98
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,172
Have you seen something?

99
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,893
Only the dead.

100
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,172
They're all...just echoes.

101
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:28,941
But no.

102
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:32,545
If someone, or something, took Ally,

103
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:34,917
they've left without a trace.

104
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:36,545
There's nothing here.

105
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,057
So what now?

106
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:42,136
Well, I think you and I should
go and have a talk with the mother.

107
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:44,081
You think the girl's still alive?

108
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:47,988
If she'd died, I'd know. There
would be an imprint of some kind.

109
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:49,570
Maybe she was abducted.

110
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:51,639
There would still be a trace.
Something.

111
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:54,199
What are you saying?

112
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:56,315
That wherever she went,

113
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:58,803
she went willingly.

114
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:44,936
You came back.

115
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:48,256
Have you been in heaven?

116
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:50,622
I've been with the lovely angel.

117
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:52,994
He's called Gilgamel.

118
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:53,901
Gil...

119
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:56,736
Gilgamel.
But you must never say his name.

120
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,389
Can I see him? Can I see Gil...

121
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:04,553
Please.
(SNIFFS)

122
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:08,656
No. He wouldn't want you.

123
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:10,576
You don't smell right.

124
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:13,809
I don't understand.

125
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,135
 What do you
mean, I don't smell right?

126
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:19,554
Please! Please can I go with him?

127
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,336
- Please can I?
- Madge?

128
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,462
Madge! Who are you talking to?

129
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:30,042
Who were you talking to?

130
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:31,485
Ally.

131
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:34,616
I was talking to Ally.

132
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:47,649
What now?

133
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:50,103
Drive around the block.

134
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,863
What's going on here?

1
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,800
Pardon me, ma'am. But you look 
like you could use a little help.

2
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,600
We're like prisoners in our own home.

3
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,500
Oh, god. I've been had, haven't I?

4
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,700
You're reporters. 

5
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,800
No, ma'am.

6
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,400
I admit we are interested in your story. 
But trust me, we are not reporters.

7
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,000
Maybe he did something to Ally. And then, 

8
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,900
I suppose, got Madge to tell
 this story about an angel.

9
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,100
And do you think she made it up?

10
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,400
I don't know. 

11
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,300
But then, I can't believe Ally 
would just run off with anyone.

12
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,100
If it was Madge, I could understand.

13
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,100
She can be a handful. 
She's always up to something.

14
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,900
I found her talking to Ally earlier.

15
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,700
In the garden at home.

16
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,400
Of course, she wasn't there. 
There was nobody there.

17
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,200
Can I talk to her?

18
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,900
You can try. She won't say anything.

19
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,600
Hey, Madge. How's it going?

20
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,700
Your mum said we could have 
a talk. Would that be OK?

21
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,200
I'm Luke.

22
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Listen, can I tell you something?

23
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,700
What happened to you... 
Well, I know what it's like.

24
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,300
You see something incredible, 
something really amazing.

25
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,900
But you can't tell anybody.

26
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,400
Or if you do tell, they 
don't believe you, right?

27
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
What did you see?

28
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,900
Well...

29
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,800
I saw this monkey...thing. Once. 

30
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,200
Monkey?

31
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Anyway, it was kind of scary.

32
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,400
But I bet what you saw was way scarier.

33
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Do you want to tell me about it?

34
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,900
Mm-mm.

35
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,500
OK.

36
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,400
What about Ally? Do you want to talk about Ally?

37
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Angel sightings are not uncommon.

38
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,800
They're usually associated with a 
catastrophic event, natural disaster or war.

39
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,200
It says here the most famous 
example is the Angel of Mons.

40
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Seen by hundreds of troops on the 
Western Front in World War One.

41
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Sightings are one thing.

42
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,600
But we've been through the records. 
And there's no mention of angel abductions. Nothing.

43
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,400
The little girl didn't say anything? 

44
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,000
She might have done.??? I didn't 
handle it right. Clutching at straws.

45
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,000
There was no half-life activity 
at the graveyard, right, Mina?

46
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,900
I've been right back to 
Van Helsing in 1642. Guess what.

47
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,900
No angels. 

48
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,500
So what now? We just let it go?

49
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,400
It happens. 

50
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,600
I'm sure Madge had something to say.

51
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,200
She was scared. It wasn't 
her fault I put her off.

52
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,100
Must be a gift.

53
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,400
This is a judgement call. 
It's very sad about little Ally.

54
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,900
But we have to say this 
is a conventional disappearance.

55
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,300
- Meaning?
- Not our department.

56
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,200
Not one for us.

57
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,600
Why me? 

58
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,800
You're good with kids. You know 
you are. They tell you things.

59
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,200
But I don't even know this Midge.

60
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,900
- Madge.
- Whatever.

61
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,600
What am I supposed to say? 

62
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Ruby, you are witty, resourceful. 
you'll think of something.

63
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,100
Is that ??

64
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
She won't get anywhere.

65
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,100
Madge can be really stubborn.

66
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Yeah, well, so can Ruby.

67
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,200
Look, Madge. 

68
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,200
I'm not going to insult you by saying 
I'm your friend. We know it's not true.

69
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,000
You seem very nice, but I don't 
know you and you don't know me.

70
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,000
I just need to know who's got your sister.

71
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,800
And...you can't tell me?

72
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,000
OK. That's cool. You've got your reasons.

73
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,400
But I really need to know who's got Ally.

74
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,600
So what if...

75
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,100
you were to write it down,

76
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,000
and I was to just happen to look at it?

77
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,800
That wouldn't really be telling, would it?

78
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,800
Do you think you could do that for me, Madge?

79
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,800
I've got...

80
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,200
A °Í2 coin, a sparkly hair slide,

81
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,400
and some black nail polish says you could.

82
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,000
Do we have a deal?

83
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,600
???

84
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,300
Good.

85
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,700
Gilgamel? 

86
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,600
That's the name.

87
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,300
Sounds weird. Are you sure?

88
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,900
- Gilgamel. Trust me.
- Brilliant.

89
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,800
Thank you. I am well impressed. 
How did you do it?

90
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,100
Bribery. 

91
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,900
You're kidding?

92
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,100
Once I figured out that Madge didn't 
like her sister, the rest was easy.

93
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,100
- Kids, eh?
- Little tinkers.

94
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,700
Speaking of which, I expect you're 
wondering how you could ever repay me.

95
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,500
Me and Jamie have a bit of 
a transport issue tomorrow.

96
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,000
We need a lift. You can sort that, can't you?

97
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Me? No. How? I don't have any transport.

98
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,400
Luke, you are witty and resourceful. 
You'll think of something.

99
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,900
So, we start again.

100
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:44,100
Collected works of Julius of Leyden. 
Revered ancestor of Abraham Van Helsing.

101
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,800
Somewhere in here I've seen the name Gilgamel.

102
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,200
We've got to find one name. 

103
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,100
What do you care? It's all in 
Dutch anyway. Start looking.

104
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,600
Suppose Madge got it wrong.

105
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,200
She's seven years old, for goodness' sake.

106
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,000
She goes to a very nice school. Keep looking.

107
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,300
Look at this!

108
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,800
There, see? Faintly.

109
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,500
What does it say?

110
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,300
Gilgamel...fugite...traveste.

111
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,400
- Yeah, it's Dutch.
- Latin. 

112
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Not Dutch, Latin. Gilgamel flee the travesty.

113
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,100
Fantastic.

114
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
What does that mean? 

115
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,100
No idea.

116
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,900
You asked what it says, not what it means.

117
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Mum! Mum!

118
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,500
Do you want a push?

119
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,100
Yeah, all right.

120
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,700
Is that your mum? 

121
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Yeah. She's always yakking.

122
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,400
You smell nice.

123
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,900
Don't stop. Keep pushing!

124
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,500
Have you ever seen an angel?

125
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,900
No.

126
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,700
Would you like to see an angel?

127
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,500
Abby!

128
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Abby!

129
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,300
Abby!

130
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,300
Will the angel take me up to heaven?

131
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,900
Yes. 

132
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,800
With all the other girls and boys.

133
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,900
What about my mum?

134
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,400
Be good and you can see the lovely angel.

135
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
I want to go back.

136
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,700
No, you don't. You've been chosen. 
You smell just right.

137
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,200
Gilgamel has need of you.

138
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,500
Let me go! 

139
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,600
There's nothing you can do.

140
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,100
See?

141
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,900
He comes.

142
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,500
Gilgamel!

143
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,800
- His mobile was switched off.
- The most important date of his life.

144
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,400
No, I appreciate that. It's a 
big thing, a driving test. 

145
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,900
Oh, he's here.

146
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,400
Oh, the wanderer returns. 

147
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,500
Terry, how's it going?

148
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,600
??Are we on, or what? 

149
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I'm up for it.

150
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,700
- ??
- What time?

151
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,700
I'll bell you in an hour. 
Have your phone on.

152
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,600
- Cool.
- I'm not waiting around for -

153
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,300
I forgot, OK?

154
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:40,800
Perhaps if you left your phone switched on, 
then people might at least be able to contact you.

155
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,800
Happy? 

156
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,400
I will not call you to share light-hearted banter

157
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,900
and discuss the issues of the day.

158
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,300
Or to seek your advice on my social life.

159
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,900
When I call, I give you my 
word it will be important.

160
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,100
Keep your cell switched on 
at all times. Is that clear?

161
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
Yes.

162
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,600
You didn't tell me you had a social life.

163
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,900
I didn't tell you another 
kid had gone missing either.

164
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,500
Oh yes, it's true. Patterns emerge.

165
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,700
Nature takes its course.

166
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,300
Be switched on and you will be saved.

167
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,200
Who's there? 

168
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,900
Simeon, I have someone to see you.

169
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,900
Depart this place. There is 
nought for your comfort here.

170
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,200
He's like you. English.Kind of uptight.

171
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,000
His name's Luke.

172
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,800
Luke Van Helsing.

1
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,200
I never thought to meet another Van Helsing. 
Not this side of the grave. 

2
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,700
Welcome, my boy. I knew your father.

3
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,100
Good to meet you, sir.

4
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,800
Simeon doesn't like colonials. Do you, Simeon?

5
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,200
He's a real whizz when it comes to 
obscure entities and half-lives.

6
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,500
I venture you are here for 
a reason, Luke Van Helsing.

7
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Not merely to view the collection.

8
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,000
Right, yes. We've been looking for angels.

9
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,400
We think they're stealing children. 

10
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,700
We have a name.

11
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,300
Yes, we do. We have a name. Gilgamel.

12
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,100
- And travesty.
- That could be important.

13
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,100
Indeed, then why are we 
prattling on about angels?

14
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:25,300
Gilgamel is not an angel. He's a demon. 
Pure and simple. A Great Nine entity.

15
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,600
Any fool would know that.

16
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,400
- And travesty?
- Travesty.

17
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,700
Or traveste.The medieval word 
for a special kind of being.

18
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,500
A demon that can take another 
form. Often a benign form.

19
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,900
Something nasty pretending 
to be something nice.

20
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Show him the parchment.

21
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,900
Julius of Leyden. Poor penmanship.

22
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,400
Wrote with his left hand. 
Did he give you this?

23
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,500
Julius died in 1650.

24
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,400
Hey, I guess time kinda passes you by in here.

25
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,900
Must play havoc with the old memory.

26
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,300
There's nothing wrong with my memory.

27
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,300
I remember this boy's father. And I remember you.

28
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,800
So I will speak with him.

29
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,700
What I have is for Van Helsing and him alone.

30
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,700
I was kinda hoping that, 

31
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,700
after all these years, you and 
I might get on a little, you know.

32
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,200
Let bygones be bygones.

33
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,900
In a phrase close to your 
colonial heart - dream on!

34
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,000
I'll see you back at the stacks. 
And don't go AWOL on me, Luke.

35
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,700
Hasta luego, Simeon.

36
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,100
Treat that man with caution.

37
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,300
Those closest to you cannot always be trusted.

38
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,100
Now kindly follow.

39
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,300
This is St Anselm.

40
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,500
Depicted carrying the sword of 
righteousness and the orb of sanctity.

41
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,400
Anselm wrestled with Gilgamel and sadly lost.

42
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,600
Maybe it's like rock, paper, scissors.

43
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,300
Sword beats demon, demon beats 
orb. That kind of thing.

44
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,600
Do you have any idea 
what you are up against?

45
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,700
Traveste beats demon, demon beats you.

46
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,600
Do you wish to continue?

47
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,400
I don't think I have a choice.

48
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,100
Denial is not an option.

49
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,200
Very well. Wait here.

50
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,300
This is St Jude. You might like a few words.

51
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
- Will it help?
- Possibly.

52
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,700
He's a patron saint of lost causes.

53
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,400
Luke! 

54
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,700
Not now, Terry. See you in a bit.

55
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,400
???Where shall I pick you up? 

56
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,600
St Jude's, Fettergate.

57
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,100
You what?! In a pub? 

58
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,600
It's not a pub. It's a church. 

59
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,000
How do I get there?

60
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,900
Use your satnav, Terry. 

61
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,200
Listen -

62
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,700
The sword of righteousness 
and the orb of sanctity.

63
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,000
Cool.

64
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,800
This is what did it for poor old Anselm.

65
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,100
Gently! Gently! 

66
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,900
I don't think we can lay blame upon the orb.

67
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,700
Used correctly, it might have saved 
his life. As it may yet save yours.

68
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,200
What do I do with them?

69
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,400
You will know when the time comes.

70
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,400
And no doubt the colonial will have a plan.

71
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,000
If you don't mind me asking, 
what is it with you two?

72
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,900
You seem...tense.

73
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,700
Tense? Certainly not.

74
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,200
I am a serious scholar of the half-life.

75
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,100
He is a boorish half-wit whose arrogance 
is exceeded only by his ignorance.

76
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Take them with my blessing. 
They're all I have for you.

77
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,800
Simeon sends his love. 

78
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,600
Whatever. What did he give you?

79
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,200
The sword of righteousness 
and the orb of sanctity. 

80
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Ring any bells?

81
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,900
Not sure. Ring the mobile. We'll test them.

82
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,600
??Not now. I've got stuff to do.

83
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,300
??What could be more important than this?

84
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Sorry, I've got to go.

85
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,500
He hung up on me!

86
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,400
That dumb old fool Simeon 
could have given him anything.

87
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,300
You want some advice? 

88
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,800
Never rely on a teenager.

89
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,300
I'll bear that in mind.

90
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,700
And never trust a zombie.

91
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,300
Why did you make me come to the city? 
You know I don't like the city.

92
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,600
I know. I'm sorry.

93
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,800
There's something else you're not going to like.

94
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,100
We have to pick up Ruby. 

95
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,200
What?!

96
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,300
And her kid brother. 

97
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,400
No way. Absolutely not. It ain't gonna happen.

98
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,500
Use your mirrors.

99
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,500
Big it up. The examiner wants to see you looking.

100
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,700
It wasn't my idea.

101
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,000
You've got your whole life to chase girlfriends.

102
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,900
- She's not my girlfriend.
- So more fool you.

103
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,900
At least get your test first.

104
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,700
Thanks, I really appreciate this.

105
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,900
No problem, sweetheart. Absolute pleasure.

106
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,000
What?

107
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,200
It doth fume with the odour of sanctity.

108
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,700
Doth it indeed?

109
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,400
And what, pray, is the odour of sanctity?

110
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,800
I'm very glad you asked. 

111
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,700
The odour of sanctity - that wondrous subtle 
scent rendered by the innocent and the saintly.

112
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,100
Why does the orb fume with it?

113
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,100
Good question. It doesn't say.

114
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,100
Luke, what's this?

115
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,300
Do not mess with it, Jamie.

116
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,200
What is it?

117
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,400
I don't know exactly. But I'm sure 
you shouldn't be messing with it.

118
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,200
??

119
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,800
Jamie.

120
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,700
Traveste demons by Gilgamel.

121
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,800
They're attracted by the odour of sanctity.

122
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,900
???Like Anselm.

123
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,700
They replicated the scent in order 
to draw out the travestes into the open.

124
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,300
So the orb is what? A sort of generator.

125
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,800
Correct. Puts out the scent.

126
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,700
Nothing for the average guy but it's rock 
and roll for the freaks. They can't get enough.

127
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,400
So if Gilgamel's out there...

128
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,600
the orb will pull him in.

129
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,900
Great. Thank you so much. 

130
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,300
No problemo, sweetheart. You 
have a great day. You too, Jamie.

131
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,900
Thank you. I promise we won't trash the place.

132
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,600
Good luck with the test.

133
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
Oi, don't even think about it!

134
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,100
???He's on voicemail. I told 
him to not switch his phone off.

135
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,800
I shouldn't have left him on his own.

136
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,100
- No.??
- No.

137
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Now he's walking around 
with a Grade A freak magnet.

138
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,500
I've seen your provisional licence.

139
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,100
So if you'll just sign here, 
we'll get started.

140
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,700
Turn it off now, please. 

141
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,600
And keep it switched off 
until we return to the centre 

142
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,100
and the vehicle is at a complete standstill.

143
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,400
Cabin doors to manual. 

144
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,600
Let's get on, shall we?

145
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,400
Right. In a moment, I am 
going to tap my pencil.

146
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,900
I want you to stop as fast and safely as you can.

147
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,500
Have you got that? 

148
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,700
Yep.

149
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,300
What was that?

150
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,100
Just something on the back seat. Sorry.

151
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
What are you doing?

152
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Why did you stop?

153
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Sorry. I thought you tapped again.

154
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,900
No, I dropped. I didn't tap.

155
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,200
Yeah... Take it easy. We've got plenty of time.

156
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,700
What are you doing?

157
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,100
Sorry. I thought you might want me to reverse.

158
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,800
If I do, I shall tell you in good time. 
There's no need for all this.

159
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Mr Rutherford, please!

160
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,900
Well, you certainly can control the vehicle.

161
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,600
No-one can accuse you of being unduly hesitant.

162
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,700
Impetuous, perhaps. Foolhardy, possibly.

163
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,500
Not ideal qualities in a motorist.

164
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,100
So I'm afraid, on this occasion,

165
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:38,400
you have failed to meet the required standard 
for the practical part of your driving test.

166
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,400
Have a good day, Mr Rutherford.

167
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,000
I can't believe you went missing.

168
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,200
I had my driving test. 

169
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,400
And your point is?

170
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,900
- Sorry?
- I gave you a direct order.

171
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,700
Who do you think you are?

172
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,200
??I'm the one doing this goddam job!

173
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,800
Boys, please!

174
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,200
He wants me to become the full 
enchilada when I can't even drive!

175
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,700
???

176
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,200
Full enchilada. I see. And did you pass?

1
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,600
I don't really want to talk about it.

2
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,500
Anyway, this really weird thing happened.

3
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,000
- We're driving along 
- You had your phone switched off.

4
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,500
It wasn't my fault! Do you want to hear about it?

5
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,200
Go on, Luke.

6
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,000
The trunk fell on the floor.

7
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,900
And the orb started hissing.

8
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,400
And then this kid appears 
right in front of the car.

9
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,800
Little girl, about ten years old. 

10
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,500
Ally Dunelm.

11
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,600
You're not surprised? I was well surprised.

12
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,700
- What did you do?
- I freaked.

13
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,500
Good choice. 

14
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Next thing, she's on the back seat.

15
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,700
No wonder you failed. 

16
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,500
At least you kept hold of the orb.??

17
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,800
You don't want to go messing 
with that little baby.

18
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,400
Are you sure you should be in here? 

19
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,600
Luke lets me.

20
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,000
Are you sure?

21
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,100
Do you want anything? 

22
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,700
No, I'm good.

23
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,100
Come on, what does it do?

24
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,400
Travestes like Gilgamel feed on innocents.

25
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,700
That's why he's going after 
children - to steal their souls.

26
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,700
It's called the gleaning of the innocents. 

27
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,000
He's attracted by the odour of sanctity.

28
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,900
- The what?
- The smell of saintliness.

29
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,400
We think Ally Dunelm could be following the scent.

30
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,100
The traveste could be using her to target victims.

31
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,800
We're not big on saints these days, 
but we still have innocent children.

32
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,300
Yeah? You should meet Ally's 
sister. Or Ruby's brother.

33
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,100
What? 

34
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,200
You got a problem here?

35
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,900
Have you ever seen an angel?

36
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,300
Who are you?

37
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,000
Would you like to see an angel?

38
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,500
An angel came.

39
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,300
There was a little girl with him.

40
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,000
Luke, they've got Jamie.

41
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,600
See what happens if you 
don't put the job first?

42
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,300
Calm down. Let's think this through.

43
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,100
Assuming it's Ally Dunelm 
collecting children for Gilgamel, 

44
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,700
he's probably holding them somewhere.

45
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,300
How do you know?

46
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,300
He'll take away their souls at one 
sitting before he goes back to the half-life.

47
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,200
Father Julius called it 
the gleaning of the innocent.

48
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,400
Don't worry. We'll find him.

49
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,400
You bet we will.

50
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,200
I'm coming with you.

51
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,100
We can find them, can't we?

52
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,400
First, there's the small matter of 
summoning a 2,000-year-old demon

53
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,600
and making him tell us where he's got them.

54
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,900
But hey, how hard can that be?

55
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,200
Give me the orb.

56
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,600
So, 

57
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,900
when the freakshow starts, we zap the gasoline.

58
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,800
That should hold him here long enough 
for us to get answers. Got your pulse gun?

59
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,900
What about this? 

60
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,000
Oh, great. A sword. It's 
interrogation, not a barbecue.

61
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,300
Simeon gave it to me. He must have had a reason.

62
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,900
Luke, I know you think Simeon 
is some kind of great guy.

63
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,500
But this is not the Dark Ages.

64
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Well, it is but... You know what I mean. Come on.

65
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,700
Showtime.

66
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,500
Galvin, it's Jamie!

67
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,800
Jamie! 

68
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,600
It's a trick! It's not him!

69
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,000
Ruby!

70
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,100
No, Luke!

71
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,600
Galvin!

72
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,900
Come here. Are you all right?

73
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,300
I'm OK.

74
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,900
I take it you're not here to tell me that 
Gilgamel has been safely dispersed to the half-life.

75
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,100
No, not exactly. We sort of lost him.

76
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,400
You lost him?

77
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,200
Yeah. And um...

78
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,200
You know the orb?

79
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,900
Yes. How was it after all these years?

80
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,000
Superb. It did just what it says on the tin.

81
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Only it got bent. 

82
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,700
Impossible. You cannot bend a sphere.

83
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,000
Well, scrunched, kind of.

84
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,500
So, short of stabbing yourself 
with the sword of righteousness,

85
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,400
you've made a complete porridge 
of the whole thing, haven't you?

86
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,300
That's another thing. We 
didn't actually use the sword.

87
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,800
Galvin thought pulse guns might be better.

88
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,000
Typical colonial. Totally unreliable.

89
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,500
He got hurt. 

90
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,300
Need I say more?

91
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,000
Give me the sword.

92
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,100
He doesn't look too good.

93
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
Don't worry about me.

94
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,000
Just worry about whether Simeon's 
got a decent idea in his head.

95
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,900
Did you never stop to wonder why 
Anselm's sword was depicted as flaming?

96
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,300
Long before there were these wretched pulse guns.

97
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,600
This sword was forged to deal 
with entities like Gilgamel.

98
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,500
It's going to be a bit conspicuous. 

99
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,100
Wandering around with a red-hot sword.

100
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,400
Don't be obtuse.

101
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,700
It forms a perfect shield and thus 
will hold its heat for many hours.

102
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
I'm impressed. 

103
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,300
So you should be.

104
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,400
Now I suppose, you want me to 
find this lost demon of yours.

105
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,800
Simeon reckons this demon spent 
so long in the half-life,

106
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,200
London will be totally different and he'll 
head for a place he feels comfortable with.

107
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,600
???

108
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,700
St Anselm Without.

109
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,900
Without any sense, if you live round here.

110
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,700
I imagine it meant without the city walls.

111
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,100
Why this place?

112
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,500
This is where Gilgamel slew poor old Anselm.

113
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,000
His last smiter.

114
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,000
Great. Thanks for that, Mina.

115
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,300
Are you OK?

116
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,400
I've come this far.

117
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,700
They're there! Ruby, come on!

118
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,700
Jamie!

119
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,900
Jamie! Jamie, are you OK?

120
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
Jamie! Jamie, are you OK?

121
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,000
Are you OK?

122
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,600
Galvin.

123
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,800
Come on. Hurry up! Hurry up!

124
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
???

125
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,000
Get the kids out! Go! Go!

126
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,300
Quick!

127
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,100
Run! Run!

128
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,600
Run! Come on, run!

129
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,300
Faster! Faster!

130
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,600
Gilgamel, I know thee, demon.

131
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,800
Return to the half-life.

132
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,500
And never come back.

133
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,300
Turn and face me!

134
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,400
Or I will most surely smite thee.

135
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,200
Has he gone?

136
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,700
Looks like it.

137
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Thanks, Mina. 

138
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,900
That's OK.

139
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,400
I think you'll find I'm 
usually pretty good in the dark.

140
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,600
Is he dead?

141
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,000
Good. Get me outta here!

142
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,000
Thanks, Luke. 

143
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,900
Do you like it?

144
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,400
It's brilliant!

145
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,200
Thanks for doing this, Mum.

146
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,500
A pleasure. They're a lovely family.

147
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,200
Has Ruby known them for long? 

148
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,000
No. Not long.

149
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,100
Galvin.

150
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,000
OK.

151
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,300
Going out? 

152
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,400
Yeah. For a bit.

153
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,200
I have to. Is that OK?

154
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,100
Yeah. Of course. Do what you like.

155
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,800
Do you need anything?

156
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,100
You could tell me what's going on.

157
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,100
You're getting more and more like him.

158
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,800
Your dad.

159
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
He never let me in.

160
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,400
Love of my life.

161
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,200
I never knew what he was thinking.

162
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,700
How are you feeling? 
I brought you some grapes.

163
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,200
Makiwara training came in useful.

164
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,600
Is that it? Is that all I get?

165
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,900
You think I'm going to fall over you 
because you torched a freak? Forget about it.

166
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,000
That is who you are. It's why you're here.

167
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,000
You damn near jeopardised the whole mission.

168
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,700
??I had a driving test. 

169
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,200
You failed the driving test. And 
you put a kid's life in danger.

170
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,800
Mum thinks I'm getting more like my dad.

171
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,500
Believe me, you got a long way to go.

172
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,200
Tell me something. 

173
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,500
Why does Simeon hate you?

174
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,800
Is that something to do with my dad?

175
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,600
Did he tell you that? 

176
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,000
No.

177
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,500
He just said you weren't to be trusted.

178
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,900
And this is from a guy who still 
thinks it's the 17th century.

179
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,200
I was going to ask you about that. 

180
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,800
- Is he actually Alive?
- Simeon?

181
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,800
Well...

182
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,900
He has been. 

183
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,800
Recently?

184
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,400
Maybe not that recently.

185
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
And he liked my dad.

186
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,200
- But he doesn't like you.
- Enough!

187
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,800
He's a crazy old zombie who lives in a church. 

188
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,600
Who cares what he likes?

189
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,900
You've got serious thinking to do. 

190
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,400
I don't want to see you again until 
you're 100%. Now get out of here.

191
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,100
Oh, Luke.

192
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,300
Leave the grapes.

193
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,500
Who sent you?

194
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,700
T-Tibbs.

195
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,500
- What did you say?
- Tibbs or something.

196
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,200
Mr Tibbs is the half-life 
that killed Galvin's wife.

197
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,100
- So what's his quirk?
- Psychopath. 

198
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,000
I'm going to kill him.

199
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,600
You should be freaked out. 

200
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,900
Your luck is going to run out eventually.

201
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,000
You should jump ship before it does.

202
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,000
Mina!

203
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,700
There won't be anyone left to catch.

204
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,200
Shame.

205
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,200
Oh, dear.

206
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:34,600
