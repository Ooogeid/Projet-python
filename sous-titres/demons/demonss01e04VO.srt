3
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,600
I'm not being funny but what 
exactly are we doing here?

4
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,700
Waiting. 

5
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,300
I got that much.

6
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,600
What am I looking for? 

7
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,800
Birds. What do you think you're looking for?!

8
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,900
Well, I can see a couple of pigeons.

9
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,000
And, yeah, there's a guy 
with a zip across his neck.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,400
I'm guessing he's not human. 

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,300
You're impressing me more every day.

12
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,500
Type five. Not a danger in 
himself. ??A dum-dum. 

13
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,200
It's his master we need to worry about.

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
I can't see any master.

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,700
Look again.

16
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,100
No. No-one. Just a couple of dead bodies.

17
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, they're not dead. 

18
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,700
They're undead.

19
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,600
Demons S01 EP04

20
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,800
Night stalkers, blood ghouls, Nosferatu. 

21
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,600
Vampires?

22
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,100
Type twelves.

23
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,800
Humans have always been fascinated by them.

24
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,900
You should read this.

25
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,800
Dracula. 

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,600
The original and the best. 

27
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,600
I think you'll find it very illuminating.

28
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,300
Can't I watch the movie?

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
You've got to be kidding me.

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,200
I take it you don't like children.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,900
Come on. Get out of the goddamn way. 

32
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,200
Or teachers.

33
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
It's good to be back.

34
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
This is the real deal, Luke.

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,800
I want you to cancel all 
driving tests, all parties.

36
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,600
From now on, don't even 
think about having a life.

37
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,700
I don't know what you're so worried about.

38
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,700
Surely we just grade them, 
smite them and move on.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,200
Better start listening, Luke.

40
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Grading them's the easy bit.

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,500
You've never been up against a type 12 and 
right now you're in no fit state to win.

42
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
I thought Thrip was a type 12.

43
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,800
Nobody likes a smart ass.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
OK. Quincey's no ordinary vampire.

45
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,000
You need to get yourself in 
training. Mina will help. 

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,100
I can help.

47
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,300
Ruby, this job requires 
intelligence and experience.

48
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,600
The first I'll take your word for,

49
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,500
the latter I need to see some more evidence.

50
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,300
And what's Mina's experience 
of fighting vampires?

51
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,000
Mina's been around a lot longer than you think.

52
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,000
What is it with people around here?

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,200
You're the only person who uses it.

54
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,400
Who does the cleaning - the fairies?

55
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,700
Ruby's good with a dishcloth.

56
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,700
Er, hello. I'm here.

57
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,100
Er, hello. I know.

58
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,800
Mina, we need your help.

59
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,300
Sorry. No can do. 

60
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,800
There are vampires in town.

61
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,300
I heard. But piano recitals without the 
pianist don't really work so well. 

62
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,100
I thought that was on Friday.

63
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,000
No. 

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
But I have tickets for Friday.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,500
Well, they should've told you. I'm sorry.

66
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,800
Maybe we'll catch up later, huh?

67
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,300
You know, if you want to help 
me, you could read this.

68
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,100
Knock me up a word document, plot summary, you know?

69
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,200
Gee, thanks. I get all the good jobs.

70
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
What would I do without you?

71
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,200
"I could feel the soft, shivering touch of 
the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,900
and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, 
just touching and pausing there."

73
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,900
But you'll need me to sign, though?

74
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,400
- Sign what?
- The health check form.

75
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,200
I always sign the health check form.

76
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:51,800
So that you know if I have 
HIV, or hepatitis, or 

77
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,400
whether I inject myself with drugs.

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,600
Do you inject yourself with drugs?

79
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,900
Good gracious, no!

80
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,200
Then I'm sure your blood 
will be absolutely fine.

81
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,000
He's very charming that 
doctor of yours, isn't he?

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,600
He did take an awful lot of blood, though.

83
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,300
It's for a very good cause. 

84
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, I know.

85
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,400
I like to think that my blood will 
help some small child somewhere.

86
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,300
I'm sure it will.

87
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,700
There you go.

88
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,100
* Keep a-going *

89
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,000
* And if it hails or if it snows *

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,400
* Keep a-going *

91
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,400
* Ain't no use to sit and whine... *

92
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,000
Kill me. I mean, really, kill me now.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,200
You're gonna have to learn to 
appreciate the finer things in life.

94
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,100
I do. I appreciate it when 
I reach a new level on Worms,

95
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,600
I appreciate it when Homer Simpson says 'd'oh',

96
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,500
I appreciate a good night out with my friends. 

97
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,300
Some other time.

98
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,100
Why are we watching Mina, anyway?

99
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,600
She's got a concert. 

100
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,500
She doesn't have a concert. She has a past.

101
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,800
If you'd been doing your 
homework, you'd know that.

102
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,600
OK. Here we go. Showtime.

103
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,500
There's something I should've 
told you about Mina.

104
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,600
Mina has half-life blood.

105
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,800
The blood of Dracula runs through her veins. 

106
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Mina's a vampire?

107
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Mina could be the most 
powerful vampire there is.

108
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,800
She controls her urges 
by cleansing her blood.

109
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,500
I don't understand. I thought 
it was 'us' and 'them'.

110
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,300
It is. She is one of us.

111
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,800
And if she starts behaving differently...

112
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,400
we grade her and smite her.

113
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,400
I don't believe you were invited.

114
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,700
I'm not any old vampire, Anika.

115
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,100
I don't need to be invited.

116
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,100
Where is he? 

117
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,500
Who?

118
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,400
I didn't know you were coming back.

119
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,000
We do a lot of things without informing you.

120
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,300
This wasn't the wisest. 

121
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,400
That remains to be seen.

122
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,000
Presumably, you were hoping to find him alone.

123
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,500
You were hoping we had gone our separate ways.

124
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,300
What Quincey does is none of my business.

125
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,700
I came here to give him a message. 

126
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,800
Leave.

127
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,000
- Mina
 - Tell him that.

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,500
Your concern is very touching.

129
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,500
Zippy!

130
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,300
If he wants to see you, I'm 
sure he knows where to find you.

131
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,700
You'll give him my message.

132
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Show Ms Harker out.

133
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,300
She appears to have left 
her guide dog at home.

1
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Good night? 

2
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,100
Where's Luke?

3
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,800
I sent him home. He's not really 
interested in piano recitals.

4
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,400
He's back, isn't he?

5
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,700
Have you seen him? 

6
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,800
No.

7
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,200
Are you sure about that?

8
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,700
Rupert, why would I lie to you?

9
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,100
I'm sorry.

10
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,600
Mina, 

11
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,000
I know this is difficult for you. But erm... 

12
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
You went round to see him, didn't you?

13
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,700
You really don't trust me, do you?

14
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,000
He wasn't there. 

15
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,400
That is the truth.

16
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,300
I spoke to the witch instead.

17
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,700
And what did she say? 

18
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,300
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

19
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,400
I know what you're thinking, Rupert.

20
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,200
I messed up last time, I know that.

21
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,400
You and Quincey have a history. I understand, 

22
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,100
but I can't afford to let 
it get in the way again. 

23
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,000
It won't.

24
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,600
We have to kill him, Mina.

25
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,100
I know.

26
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,000
I won't stand in your way.

27
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,000
- All right?
- Hey. 

28
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,700
How's my favourite freedom fighter?

29
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,800
Great. I spent the night 
sitting in Galvin's car,

30
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
drinking in the aroma of stale whiskey

31
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,400
and listening to country and western. 

32
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,100
I thought I got all the good jobs.

33
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,500
He's on my back about not doing 
my homework. What have you learnt?

34
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,900
Dracula - I presume you've finished it. 

35
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,300
Not exactly.

36
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,200
Well, it's really long and really boring. 

37
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,800
Can't I just watch the film?

38
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,600
Mina's in it. I need to 
know what it says about Mina. 

39
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh, right.

40
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,600
Yeah. It says she's a boring 
bitch we can do without.

41
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,400
It says she's a vampire.

42
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,000
You wanted to see him.

43
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,700
Your wish is granted.

44
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,700
It annoys you, doesn't it, having me around?

45
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,400
He's in there...

46
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,100
somewhere.

47
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,800
I told you not to come back.

48
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,000
When have I ever listened to you before?

49
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't want to know where you've been

50
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,700
??or what you've been up to. 

51
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,100
It's lovely to see you too.

52
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,200
What do you want, Quincey? 

53
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,500
- Catch up.
- I doubt it. 

54
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,500
I miss you.

55
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,800
It's the truth, for all it's worth.

56
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,500
I miss you, Mina.

57
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
Do you miss me?

58
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,500
- I think so.
- What do you want?

59
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,900
I've had enough of being on my own.

60
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,600
Would you believe me if I said I was lonely? 

61
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
But you have Anika.

62
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,600
I'm lonely and it's your fault.

63
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Don't start that again. 

64
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
It's true.

65
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,900
What would you have me do?

66
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,400
I don't know. I didn't have a choice.

67
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
Join me. 

68
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,700
No.

69
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,000
You belong with me. 

70
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,400
No.

71
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,500
Imagine how powerful we could be together.

72
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,300
Or maybe you've got something better to do.

73
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,300
I need time...

74
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I have time.

75
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,600
..to think.

76
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
You'll find me?

77
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,100
Vampires have been around for thousands of years.

78
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,900
You'll find a vampire myth 
in almost every culture.

79
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,900
Most people think vampires 
come from Transylvania,

80
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,200
but actually they started out in the Far East.

81
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,600
From China, and Tibet

82
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,900
they transported themselves with the trade 
caravans along the silk route to the Mediterranean.

83
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,600
Maybe they were looking for 
a better quality of life.

84
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,700
The Slavs seem to think that if they 
scatter poppy seeds at their graveside,

85
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,200
vampires will stay up all night counting 
them, instead of killing people. 

86
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,400
Sadly that is untrue.

87
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,300
The South Americans think that aloe vera over 
the door will do the trick. Also untrue.

88
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,900
The only thing that will 
help against a type 12 

89
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,900
are quick reactions.

90
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,800
Vampires move faster than a New-York minute. 

91
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,300
How fast is that?

92
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,800
About this fast.

93
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,100
Who's side are you on?

94
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,100
I think I'll be all right, a bit of practice...

95
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,300
Oh, this is just the beginning, my boy.

96
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,600
Those skills will only help you if you're 
fighting vampires, not if you want to kill them. 

97
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,200
I'll buy a few bulbs of garlic and 
Mum's got a stake in the garden.

98
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,800
Fairy stories. Only vampires can kill vampires.

99
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,100
If you want to kill a vampire, 
you gotta bring it back to life.

100
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,300
Right.

101
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,200
We need a sample of Quincey's DNA.

102
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,600
You mean like a hair or something? 

103
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,100
A hair, a piece of clothing. 

104
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,000
Fine.

105
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,700
I'll just ask if I can borrow his jeans.

106
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,900
We need to stake out his lair. 
There's gotta be something there. 

107
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,300
More waiting around in cars.

108
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,700
No car this time, sorry.

109
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,700
I come bearing gifts.

110
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,300
And information.

111
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,500
Mina is a slapper. 

112
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,100
That is the crucial piece of news 
that will solve this whole case.

113
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,300
Seriously. She let Dracula suck her 
blood night after night after night.

114
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,100
What else? 

115
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,800
She's, like, really old. I mean like 
150. Underneath her clothes she must -

116
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,600
Ruby, have you found out anything useful?

117
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Interesting not necessarily useful.

118
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,800
You are completely hopeless, you know that?

119
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I am not...not completely.

120
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,500
Are you sure you're up to this? 

121
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Yeah.

122
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,200
Just don't get too close. Call us 
when he's on his way home. Take this. 

123
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,600
I can do that.

124
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,400
Galvin, should we have a rendezvous 
point in case we get split up?

125
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,000
Is that what your mum does when 
she goes to the grocery store?

126
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,900
Don't let them smell your fear, Luke.

127
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,400
Mr Galvin.

128
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,000
So nice to see you again.

129
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,200
Galvin? 

130
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,500
Galvin?

131
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,700
Where are you?

132
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,600
Oh dear. 

133
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,700
Have you lost your friend?

134
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,000
Galvin's not here.

135
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,200
Galvin?

136
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,100
Are you feeling lonely?

137
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,800
I'll keep you company.

138
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,900
Unlucky.

139
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,600
Galvin. Galvin.

140
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Galvin. Galvin! Galvin!

1
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,300
Oh, erm, a lemonade, please.

2
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,700
You must have worked up quite a 
thirst following me all that way.

3
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,300
At least let me buy you a drink.

4
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,200
The problem is, that vampires 
have really had a bad press.

5
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,300
And you just can't afford to 
get a bad press these days.

6
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,500
??The fact is that you kill people.

7
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,400
You kill to eat.

8
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,900
- Well, yeah, but
 - It's no different.

9
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,300
I eat chicken. 

10
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,500
Do you like it?

11
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,700
- Love it.
- It's the same for me.

12
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,500
Chickens don't have feelings. 

13
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,400
Are you sure about that?

14
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,300
They're not intelligent.

15
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,200
Neither are most humans.

16
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,500
So, I mean... How many
people have you killed?

17
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,700
You're intrigued now, huh?

18
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,500
I'm not intrigued. I'm horrified.

19
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,900
How often do you eat chicken? 

20
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,900
Once a fortnight.

21
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,400
- For...?
- 18 years.

22
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,600
Once a fortnight for 18 
years. That's 468 chickens. 

23
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,800
Now, if you imagine that I've been 
alive about six times longer than you...

24
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,100
That's a lot of people.

25
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,000
The chickens feel the same.

26
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,900
You shouldn't have sent him in there.

27
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
- He'll be fine.
- I'll be fine.

28
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,500
God damn it. He's the Last Van Helsing. 
He has to fight vampires some time. 

29
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,600
He's not ready.

30
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,000
Nor's Galvin. 

31
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,700
That's not the problem. We 
have cuts and bruises but no DNA.

32
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,900
Hiya. 

33
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,400
We'll have to go back in there. 

34
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,300
It's too dangerous.

35
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
What's up? 

36
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,100
There must be another way.

37
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,900
Are you sure an old-fashioned stake 
through the heart won't kill him? 

38
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,300
We've tried that.

39
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,000
Don't ask.

40
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,100
Did you get your butt kicked?

41
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,900
Supposing we get the DNA, what 
were you going to do with it?

42
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,400
??By using electric currents 
to stimulate dead DNA,

43
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,300
dust becomes living. 

44
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,000
Then what?

45
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,400
We shoot him with it. The 
live DNA infects his body.

46
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,200
What was once dead, lives again.

47
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,500
And without his immortality...

48
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,600
Quincey reverts back to his natural age.

49
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
- Which is?
- 125.

50
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
- At which point
- He dies. 

51
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,800
Cool.

52
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,000
Well, it would be 'cool', if we 
could get a sample of his DNA.

53
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,000
Did you not get his DNA, then?

54
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,100
Do you have anything useful to say?

55
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,300
I may be blind, but I'm not stupid. 
I can hear you pulling faces. 

56
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,400
You cannot hear me pulling faces.

57
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,700
Ladies.

58
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,800
Well, I might have something useful.

59
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,400
Is that what I think it is? 

60
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,000
What is it?

61
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,800
You mean you can't hear it?

62
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,100
How did you get a hold of that? 

63
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,700
Don't ask.

64
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,600
Yes!

65
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,300
I'm beating you by 100 points.

66
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,500
Thank you, Zippy.

67
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,600
You're really rubbish.

68
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
Thank you Zippy.

69
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,400
Anika's better than you.

70
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,500
Thank you, Zippy.

71
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,800
What can I get you, sir?

72
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,300
You, Gail.

73
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,400
I'm not for sale.

74
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,600
I wasn't planning on paying.

75
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,300
I'll catch you up.

76
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,600
Interesting choice of entertainment.

77
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,800
You should've seen me. I'm the master.

78
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,500
So, I presume you're 
here to tell me 'yes'.

79
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,700
Oh, you do, do you?

80
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,500
People don't come across town in the middle 
of the night to a deserted parking lot to say 'no'. 

81
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,300
They pick up the phone.

82
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,600
What's the deal? You're unnerving me.

83
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,600
I've thought a lot about my life.

84
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,500
You're right.

85
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,000
You're all I have. I mean...

86
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,600
sure, there's Galvin, but he's 
just going to grow old and die.

87
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,500
I'll do it.

88
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,500
I'll join you.

89
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,600
They're waiting in the car. 

90
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,700
You're gonna need your coat 
on. It's freezing outside. 

91
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,900
Here.

92
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,200
You're terrible at small 
talk, you know that? 

93
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,300
Yes.

94
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,500
I'm fine.

95
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,100
Really.

96
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,000
What time are you meeting him?

97
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,700
In half an hour.

98
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
Let's just get this over with.

99
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,800
So, who is this Quincey bloke anyway?

100
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,400
Just someone I used to know.

101
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,500
You don't read very fast, do you? 

102
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,100
He isn't in the book.

103
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,000
I don't think.

104
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,900
You're not coming. 

105
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,500
- What?
- Not safe. 

106
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,300
- But...
- No buts.

107
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,800
If I wanted to sell my story to the 
tabloids, I'd make a lot of money. 

108
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,700
You would.

109
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,900
You need to keep me happy.

110
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,700
Quincey, Quincey, Quincey...

111
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,800
"Seven years ago we all went through 
the flames." Blah-de-blah-de-blah.'

112
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,600
"It is an added joy to Mina and me that..."

113
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,400
Bloody hell.

114
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,200
You could look slightly 
more pleased to see me.

115
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,100
I am. 

116
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,000
I thought you weren't coming.

117
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,200
I had a bit of a run in with Anika.

118
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,800
She's not massively happy 
about the whole thing.

119
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,500
I told her it changes nothing, but I 
think she knows that's a bit of a lie.

120
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,100
She's in love with you.

121
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,200
Yes, well...

122
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,200
We don't have to go 
through with this, you know?

123
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,000
You could leave, take Anika, start afresh.

124
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,100
What? A new life in the country?

125
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,800
I don't think she'd be very good 
at baking cakes and making jam.

126
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,300
This is what I've always wanted, Mina.

127
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,000
For you

128
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,700
to finally admit to what you really are.

129
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,300
A proper vampire.

130
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,900
To be with me.

131
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,200
I'm sorry. 

132
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,900
I told you not to come back.

133
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,000
Not to worry.

134
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,100
I've kicked Galvin's arse before.

135
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,900
You may have got away last time, 
but this time we got a new weapon.

136
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,400
New blood. 

137
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Terrifying.

138
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,300
Your DNA, it should be.

139
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,200
OK. Do it.

140
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,800
No!

141
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,000
Blood is thicker than water.

142
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,100
That's just great.

143
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,400
What did you think you were doing?

144
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,900
Please, Mina, enlighten me because 
I must be missing something here.

145
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,500
You just sacrificed Galvin 
for some old lover. 

146
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,100
He's not my lover.

147
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,300
He's my son.

1
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,300
Luke.

2
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,000
You're not very good at lying low, are you?

3
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,800
You better have a good explanation 
cos he's got Galvin and Ruby. 

4
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,900
- Calm down.
- Calm down?!

5
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,900
We need to take care of your arm.

6
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,100
Is it bad? 

7
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,300
No, it could've been a lot worse.

8
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,000
I don't know why you didn't 
just let him kill me.

9
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,300
I would never do that.

10
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Us and them. Grade them and smite them.

11
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,200
I thought you believed that crap too. 

12
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,900
I do. I do.

13
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,000
You don't have children, Luke. 
You couldn't possibly understand.

14
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,500
These aren't things you 
choose, they just happen.

15
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,200
I didn't ask to be bitten by Dracula.

16
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,200
We were happy - Jonathan, Quincey and I.

17
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,200
We were a proper family.

18
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,400
- I had a normal life.
- I thought they cured you.

19
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,800
That's what it said in Ruby's synopsis...

20
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,600
which she got off the internet.

21
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,300
Nothing worked.

22
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,800
They managed to keep it at bay for a while but...

23
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,300
I am what I am...

24
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,800
a vampire.

25
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,400
I watched as my husband, Jonathan, 

26
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,700
grew old and died.

27
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,400
Quincey was all I had left.

28
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,500
He was so much like Jonathan - 
so intelligent and gentle.

29
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,800
Er, hello? Gentle?!

30
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,500
It's true.

31
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,200
But that was a long time ago.

32
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,000
He changed.

33
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,000
After the war he was damaged and bitter.

34
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,400
Everywhere he went he was 
surrounded by death and then...

35
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,800
death came for him too.

36
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,000
Many soldiers died of septicaemia.

37
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,400
Their wounds became infected.

38
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,100
There was no way of 
treating them, no antibiotics,

39
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,500
no knowledge of blood groups.

40
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,300
Quincey wouldn't have lasted another day.

41
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,000
I couldn't sit there 
and watch him die, Luke.

42
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,400
He was my only child,

43
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,100
the only link to the life I once had.

44
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,500
I knew there was one 
thing that would save him.

45
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,200
My blood.

46
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,700
Sleep now.

47
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,200
And when you wake, everything will be better.

48
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,300
You turned Quincey into a vampire.

49
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,000
I saved his life. 

50
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

51
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,600
I didn't know it was going to turn out like this.

52
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,200
I thought Quincey would be able 
to control his urges like I do.

53
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,800
He chose to embrace his anger instead.

54
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,700
Why didn't you tell me this before?

55
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,400
It's not something I'm proud of.

56
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
I'm sorry, Luke.

57
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,400
I messed everything up.

58
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,500
Listen,

59
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,500
I don't see things as black and white as Galvin,

60
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,500
but it seems pretty clear to me -

61
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,200
Quincey has to die. 

62
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,500
I know.

63
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
I've given him enough chances.

64
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,500
He's not going to change. 

65
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,700
I'm going in after them.

66
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,900
I don't think that's a very good idea.

67
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,400
You've seen how powerful Quincey is.

68
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,700
Galvin tried to defeat him 
once - tried and failed.

69
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,100
We can't afford to lose you, Luke.

70
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,200
You couldn't beat him when you were healthy.

71
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,700
This. Flesh wound.

72
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,900
I'm going to find them. You 
can either help me or not.

73
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,900
Give me a few hours.

74
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,900
I'll be waiting.

75
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,400
I can't imagine how it feels to be 
hung out to dry by your own mother.

76
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
I lost my family a long time ago,

77
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,300
as did you, if I remember correctly.

78
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,800
Nice earrings.

79
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,300
It wasn't a very nice thing 
you did - stealing a hair.

80
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,300
You could've asked.

81
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,300
That's an interesting new 
recruit you've got, Galvin.

82
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,700
He's got his father's good looks.

83
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,400
You better start making a will - 
he's the real deal.

84
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,800
I already have. 

85
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,000
Everything goes to my next 
of kin. What about you?

86
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,300
Who gets the car? Or have you 
obtained something else worth leaving? 

87
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,600
I got a clear conscience.

88
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,900
Really? 

89
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,100
I don't think Luke would agree with 
that. What do you think, Ruby?

90
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,900
Has Galvin not told you the 
real story of Luke's dad?

91
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,200
Are you keeping us here until Mina gives in? 

92
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,800
I can live without Mina.

93
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,200
I have done for most of my life.

94
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,700
It's not her that I want.

95
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:17,000
But she does have something rather dear to me.

96
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,300
I should take you out, you know that?

97
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,700
You should, but you won't.

98
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,400
I told you to leave. 

99
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,100
You didn't tell me you were going to kill him. 

100
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,800
I had no choice.

101
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,800
You are a terrible mother.

102
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,100
He's not an ideal son.

103
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,500
You have 24 hours.

104
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
And what exactly does he want?

105
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,100
It's simple. 

106
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
What he wanted all along -

107
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,200
not you...

108
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,700
..your blood.

109
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,300
Where have you been?

110
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,500
Well, what's the story?

111
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,500
- I'm not happy about this.
- I'm not happy either.

112
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,400
God knows whether Galvin and Ruby 
are even alive. Where are they?

113
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,300
It's a warehouse in Shoreditch.

114
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,500
Do you want me to come with you?

115
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,200
Thanks, but I think it's 
best I go on my own.

116
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,200
It's wine. 

117
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,100
Doesn't smell like any wine I've ever drunk.

118
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,000
Maybe there's a little blood in there. 

119
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,500
Why do you do it?

120
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,300
Mina's not going to join you. 

121
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,500
Why do you do what you do?

122
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,400
- I have my reasons.
- Bitterness.

123
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,200
It's been a few years now 

124
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,400
maybe it's time to let it go.

125
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,400
You half-lives took away the 
one thing I had in my life.

126
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,600
Oh, she was lovely -

127
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,200
Galvin's wife.

128
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,600
He's got a picture in his wallet.

129
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,700
I'm sure he'll show you some time.

130
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,800
Galvin likes to group us all together.

131
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,300
One half-life got his back up, 
so we all have to suffer.

132
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,000
People deal with their problems in different ways.

133
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,900
You have no idea about problems.

134
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,500
My mother was bitten by Dracula, I 
fought in a war I didn't believe in,

135
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,400
my father died, my friends 
died and to top it all off

136
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,300
my mother turned me into a vampire. 

137
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,200
I deserve my time on the couch.

138
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,700
He's got a point. 

139
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,900
Don't let him sweet talk you, Ruby. He's a 
killing machine just like the rest of them.

140
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,800
One, two, three.

141
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,300
All right? 

142
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,100
Role play.

143
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,000
You know how it is.

144
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,500
Galvin is obsessed with revenge.

145
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,800
For me, it's power.

146
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,600
And with Mina's blood,

147
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,800
the pure blood of Dracula,

148
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,400
I will be the most powerful vampire around.

149
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,300
Chin, chin.

150
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,900
Mina!

151
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,400
"You gave me the wrong 
address. What's going on?

152
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,000
Mina, pick up. Mina!"

153
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,400
Mother?

154
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,700
I want you to let them go.

155
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,100
This has nothing to do with them.

156
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,100
Forgive me if I don't entirely trust you.

157
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,800
You're my son, Quincey.

158
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,000
I didn't let them hurt you, did I?

159
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,700
I won't let you down again.

160
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,900
I've saved your life before. Remember?

161
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,200
And that was the biggest 
mistake I've ever made.

162
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,200
Bloody hell.

163
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,800
For once, Ruby, I think you might be right.

164
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,600
Can you reach my hands?

165
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,100
Not quite. Yeah!

166
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,300
No matter how much you want to, you can't. 

167
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,000
You gave me life.

168
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,500
I'm still your son. 

169
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,000
No, not any more.

170
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,400
Yours...and Jonathan's...

171
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,700
The time for games is over, Mr Galvin.

172
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,700
I offered a perfectly reasonable 
swap, but my mother has declined.

173
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,600
I can only apologise. 

174
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,100
I'm sorry too.

175
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,100
Luke!

176
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,400
- You said that wouldn't kill her.
- It'll slow her down.

177
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,500
Quincey!

178
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,900
I'm sorry.

179
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,200
Don't worry about me.

180
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,800
I've died before.

181
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,000
God damn it!

182
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,200
I am going to buy you a new coffee machine.

183
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,600
It's worse than that.

184
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,400
Stack 11, second shelf, third book along.

185
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,800
You'll be the first vampire in heaven, Mina.

186
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,200
Well, I'll send word to 
you in hell, Rupert Galvin.

187
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,700
You can see, right, when you're a vampire?

188
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,600
That must be weird.

189
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,100
It is.

190
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,900
Now I know what you both look like.

191
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,000
And...? 

192
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,900
You're better than I expected.

193
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,800
You're...as...I expected. 

194
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,600
What's that supposed to mean?

195
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,000
No, I'm sorry. What is that supposed to mean?

196
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,700
It means things are back to normal.

197
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,100
Actually, Galvin, you could 
do with losing a few pounds.

198
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,500
Word is you got yourself a new girlfriend. 

199
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,500
It's Alice.

200
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,100
It's girls like her that 
give women a bad reputation.

201
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,600
Everybody's part of this war. 
They just don't know about it yet.

202
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,100
It symbolises vengeance 
and must be paid in blood.

203
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,400
What is it?

204
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,400
It was Luke. He looked like he was dead.

205
