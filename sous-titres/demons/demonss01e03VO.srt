1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,300
All this training you're making me do...

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,800
did you have to do it?

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,500
Don't be ridiculous.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,900
I like to focus on my mental agility.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,200
I guess that's what happens when you get old.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,700
You have to hand it to them.
 They've got balls.

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,300
Sadly...no brains.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,500
And there's no way they can get in here, OK?

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,000
You ready?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,300
After you.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,000
After you!

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,600
This is quite a gathering. Who sent you?

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,400
Say what?

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,000
You heard me correctly.

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,500
Play nicely. You ain't playing nicely, man.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,700
No kidding. Who sent you?

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,700
What did you do that for?

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,600
You got an attitude problem, you know that?

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,600
My boss told me - "Rupert 
Galvin, he's twisted."

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,200
Boss?

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,300
You disrespect my tail, you disrespect me.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,400
You're damn right I disrespect you. 
OK, let's start again, huh?

23
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,800
Who sent you?

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,500
Tibbs.

25
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,000
Mister Tibbs to you.

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,900
Where is he?

27
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,100
I ain't telling you that.

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,700
Three, two...

29
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,800
I didn't quite get that.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,900
Liberty Hall.

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,500
He's at Liberty Hall.

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,800
You...said you wouldn't kill me if I told you.

33
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,100
No, I never said that. Luke, did I say that?

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,500
I don't think so.

35
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,100
Shame.

36
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,100
What was all that about?

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,600
Who's Tibbs?

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,000
Nobody important.

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,500
Deal with it tomorrow.

40
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,700
You got a concert to go to?

41
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,700
What are you going to do?

42
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,300
Nothing. Research. Go on. Have a good night.

46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Hiya.

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,800
An evening of culture wouldn't kill you, you know.

48
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,200
Sorry, I got caught up. 

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,900
??Where? The pub?

50
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,300
Would I rather be with a beer than 
my two favourite ladies?

51
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,500
Three favourite ladies.

52
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,600
I wouldn't go that far. 

53
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Mina, this is my mum, Jenny.

54
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,400
It's a pleasure. Luke has missed a real treat.

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,600
I didn't realise you had such talented friends.

56
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
Oh, thank you!

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,100
You missed the action.

58
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,800
I wouldn't say that.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, why don't you walk me to the 
car? You can make up for it.

60
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,500
Lovely to meet you, Jenny.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,400
She's very beautiful in the part, isn't she? 

62
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,100
So, what happened? I thought 
Chopin was your favourite.

63
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,800
You know he is. He's just not quite as 
appealing as a run-in with the Noisy Boys.

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,600
Oh dear. 

65
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,300
They were trying to break into the Stacks.

66
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,900
Quite a mission for a Type Four. 

67
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,400
It wasn't their idea.

68
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,500
Is Galvin concerned? 

69
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,200
We've got a name and address. We'll 
deal with it tomorrow. Tibbs or something.

70
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,700
What did you say?

71
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,100
Tibbs or something.

72
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,700
Where exactly did you leave Galvin?

73
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,900
In the Stacks.

74
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,100
Doing what?

75
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,500
Research.

76
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,600
I'll be back in a minute.

77
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,300
Hey. Listen...I know I said we'd 
get a drink, but I've got to go.

78
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,100
Oh, Luke! We haven't seen you all evening.

79
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,500
I know, sorry. Mina's invited me clubbing.

80
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,700
- I'll come.
- Oh, Ruby!

81
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,600
Well...if it's all right? Well...

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,500
Great.

83
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,300
Oh, dear. Is she crashing your date?

84
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,700
I'll see you soon.

85
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,900
OK. Bye.

86
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,900
I don't know what you're so worried 
about. Galvin was fine when I left.

87
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,400
He was going to potter round the Stacks.

88
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,900
Galvin, potter?

89
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,700
Please. Do you have any idea who Mr Tibbs is?

90
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,400
No, I haven't been told.

91
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,600
Mr Tibbs is the half-life 
that killed Galvin's wife.

92
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,700
Where are the guns?

93
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,000
How long has he been gone?

94
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,200
Dunno. An hour, two maybe.

95
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
Great.

96
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,100
What time is it?

97
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,600
Five minutes since you last asked. 

98
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,900
??Should I have a gun?

99
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,900
Not now, Ruby. 

100
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,400
No. Not now.

101
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,300
When we get there.

102
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,100
- I've got it covered.
- He's got it covered.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
Well, what is the problem?

104
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,700
You're not trained. 

105
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,400
And you're in the SAS now?

106
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,900
Children!

107
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,900
I want to be able to cover your back.

108
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
You can cover my back.

109
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,300
With what? Marmalade? Luke, I need a gun.

110
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,400
You cannot have a gun.

111
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,800
Why not?

112
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,600
Because I've only got one.

113
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
What?

114
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,400
Galvin took the rest.

115
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,700
Right, let me get this straight.

116
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,700
We're about to go and fight one of the most 
dangerous creatures in the half-life

117
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,700
with a blind woman, two teenagers, and...one gun.

118
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,700
You got a problem with that?

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
Get back.

120
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,100
Ruby, hold them off.

121
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,400
- What?
- Just point and shoot.

122
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,800
Ruby, shoot!

123
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,200
What did you think you were doing?

124
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Taking tea, obviously.

125
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,000
Is that what Maggie would have wanted?

126
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,700
For you to be killed by the 
same low-life that got her?

127
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,300
I'll forgive you your rational mind, Mina.

128
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,800
Yeah, well, I won't forgive you your 
balls. Too often they rule your brain.

129
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,500
You want a drink?

130
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,400
It's a bit early for me.

131
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,000
That rule doesn't apply when 
you've been up all night.

132
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,200
Are you planning on getting any rest?

133
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,000
No.

134
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,900
Ever?

135
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,100
No.

136
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,300
Until he's dead.

137
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,900
I'm sorry, Rupert.

138
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,300
Why are you sorry? You were right.

139
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,200
I know how you feel.

140
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,700
But Maggie wouldn't want you -

141
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
You know, it's been 20 years since Maggie died,

142
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,600
and there's not a day goes by 
that I don't think about her.

143
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,000
What will you do if you find Tibbs?

144
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
If you kill him, will you be happy -

145
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
Hey. How are you feeling?

146
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,000
I didn't think so.

147
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,800
He's not here. You're going to be fine.

148
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,600
You're safe.

149
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,100
Luke, Ruby.

150
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,500
OK, this is what we're up against. Tobias Tibbs.

151
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
A Grade 11 entity.

152
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,900
These don't look too hot.

153
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,300
So what's his quirk?

154
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,600
Psychopath.

155
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,000
He's a rat that experiments on 
humans. He thinks it's funny.

156
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,700
It's hilarious. Is that what happened to - ?

157
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,200
Grace? Presumably.

158
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Have you managed to get 
any information out of her?

159
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,500
Her name.

160
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,900
Maybe we should push her a bit.

161
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,800
I think she's been through enough.

162
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,400
Yes, well, I need to go back to 
the factory to get a reading. Luke?

163
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,100
Will you be all right?

164
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
Are you looking after me now?

165
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,100
Sometimes I wish I could turn these visions off.

166
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,400
Here, take my arm.

167
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,200
You don't get flashbacks 
when you touch me, do you?

168
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,100
Why? What have you been up to?

169
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,600
Do you think Grace was a normal person once?

170
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,800
A missing person.

171
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,500
That's exactly what she is.

172
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,600
The police keep a database of missing persons.

173
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,200
A fair percentage - casualties of the half-life.

174
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,000
And the rest?

175
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,800
Well, humans can be pretty nasty too.

176
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah.

177
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,000
Is that what happened to your wife? Tibbs took her?

178
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Is that why you became a smiter?

179
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,400
What happened?

180
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,800
I don't know. By the time 
I found her, she was dead.

181
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,100
Yeah, well, you should be freaked out, Ruby.

182
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,700
You could have been killed last night. 
You could have got us all killed.

183
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,100
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

184
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,600
And your luck is going to run out eventually.

185
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,300
Maybe you should jump ship before it does.

186
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,700
And go back to what?

187
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,400
I don't know. Play netball. 
Whatever girls of your age do.

188
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,300
Have a normal life.

189
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't want a normal life.

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I know what you want, Ruby.

191
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,300
But it's not going to happen. You can't 
just smite your way into Luke's heart.

192
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,600
The sooner you realise that, the better.

193
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
I've never seen Galvin so angry.

194
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,200
I mean, it's not like 
he's a relaxed kind of guy.

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,900
I suppose this is different.

196
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,900
You're not old enough to have enemies, Luke.

197
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,500
Not...real ones.

198
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,200
But you will, one day.

199
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,700
There's something to look forward to.

200
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,800
What were you hoping for? Wife, kids?

201
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
Not yet.

202
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,900
Not ever.

203
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,600
You don't mean that.

204
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,500
Why not? Families aren't exactly 
compatible with our life style.

205
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,600
I think I've proved that. Galvin's proved that.

206
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,300
Life could get a bit dull on my own.

207
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,700
I'm sure it will. But you'll 
find something to fill the gap.

208
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,200
Is that why you play the piano?

209
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,500
That's why Galvin drinks.

210
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,900
Maybe you could become addicted to exercise.

211
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,300
Great.

212
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,400
Now you understand why Galvin's so angry.

213
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,900
He had someone.

214
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,200
Give me your hand.

215
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll see you later.

216
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,000
Luke...

217
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,900
Sorry if I upset you earlier.

218
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,000
It's cool. I understand.

219
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,400
I'm looking forward to a lifetime 
of Saturday nights down the gym.

220
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,000
I'll see you later.

221
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,200
OK.

222
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,200
What you doing here?

223
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,600
I need to ask you something.

224
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,300
I've got to get back.

225
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,200
Do you want me around?

226
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,300
What do you mean do I want you around?

227
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,500
Galvin...thinks I'm better 
off out of the action.

228
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
That you need to do this on your own.

229
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,700
Yeah, a lot of people seem to think that.

230
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,000
Well...I don't care about them.

231
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,500
What do you think? Just...

232
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,900
You just say the word and I'll be off.

233
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,800
You know I like having you around.

234
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,700
- ??
- It's dangerous.

235
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,100
What if something serious happened to you?

236
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,500
You're even starting to sound like him.

237
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,600
Yeah? Well, maybe he's right.

238
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,600
I don't want any of this, 
but I don't have a choice.

239
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,000
You do.

240
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,400
Why would you want to hang around?

241
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,100
You really don't know?

242
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,700
No.

243
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,600
Take care.

244
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Hello.

245
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,600
You all right?

246
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,700
I'll make you something proper, if you like.

247
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,000
No time.

248
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,700
How was the club?

249
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
What club?

250
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,300
The club you spent the entire night in with Mina.

251
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Yeah, it was good, you know.

252
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes, I think I know.

253
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,100
I do vaguely remember what it was 
like to be young, free and single.

254
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,200
You are free. You are single.

255
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,100
You have lunch when you want. 
You can date who you want.

256
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,800
What exactly is so difficult about your life?

257
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,200
Luke!

258
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,400
I'm sorry.

259
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,100
I've had a long night.

260
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,900
I've got a bad feeling about 
this. Something is not right.

261
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,200
What do you mean? You got 
the location, didn't you?

262
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,400
What are you worried about? 

263
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,200
It's too easy.

264
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,300
You know sometimes, Mina, 
you love to create problems. 

265
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm going after him and I'm going to kill him.

266
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm not trying to stop you, 
just be patient. We need more time.

267
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,600
We have no more time.

268
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,100
OK, I want you to stay here with Mina. 
When I get back, we'll think of a better plan.

269
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Please don't leave me. He'll come.

270
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,500
No, he won't. You're perfectly safe.

271
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,700
He's not stupid. He'll find me. 
I can't go back there!

272
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,200
Grace, listen to me.

273
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,200
I'm going to kill him. But for 
that to happen, I need to leave -

274
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,500
No, you can't leave me!

275
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,900
You'll be fine, trust me. Mina -

276
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,600
Mina's blind! How can she help me?

277
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,800
Please, take me somewhere safe.

278
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,400
Come on.

279
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,200
OK. No half-life has ever penetrated these walls.

280
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
You'll be perfectly safe.

281
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,100
Hell, we've even got a coffee machine.

282
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,500
I can't work coffee machines.

283
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Well, apart from refreshments...
you'll be just fine, OK? 

284
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,400
Thank you.

285
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,600
Galvin, I don't like this.

286
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
You ready?

287
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,800
Let's go catch us a rat.

288
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,500
Let's go kill us a rat.

289
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,300
He'll be back soon.

290
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,000
And this will all be over.

291
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,900
I'm not so sure.

292
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,900
Grace, I know you've been through a lot. 

293
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,200
But it's time to move on with your life now.

294
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,500
I'm not thinking too much about MY life.

295
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,300
Well, you should.

296
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,300
Right now...

297
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,700
I'm thinking about yours.

298
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,200
Mine?

299
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,400
Oh, absolutely.

300
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,100
Tobias!

301
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,800
MISTER Tibbs.

302
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,500
No half-life has ever penetrated these walls!

303
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,700
Well, I am privileged.

304
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,500
And so are you.

305
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,900
After all, few people...

306
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,500
get to witness such a... momentous occasion.

307
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,800
Poor Galvin.

308
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,200
He'll be very cross when he finds out.

309
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,800
Very cross. And then very dead.

310
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,900
Such a shame. Ah!

311
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
This is mine, I fancy.

312
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,500
I'm done.

313
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,200
Yes, my dear.

314
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,700
I rather think you are.

315
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,400
He's not here, I'm afraid.

316
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,700
It's OK, I don't need to speak to him. 

317
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Will you just give him this, please?

318
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,500
Right. No message?

319
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,500
No.

320
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,300
No love left between you two?

321
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,700
No love left.

322
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,000
Ruby.

323
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,200
Coffee?

324
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,300
Is this what I think it's about?

325
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
I dunno. Probably not.

326
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,900
I know you and Luke... have been friends forever.

327
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,900
There was always going to come a time 
when... other things intervened.

328
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,200
Things that...come into 
conflict with that friendship.

329
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,400
What do you mean?

330
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,700
Well, just because Luke's going 
down a different path...

331
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,500
doesn't mean he thinks any less of you.

332
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,600
A different path?

333
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,300
What's he told you?

334
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,600
He doesn't have to tell me anything.

335
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,800
- Oh, in that case 
- I just know.

336
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,000
Right...

337
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Are you...sure you know?

338
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,800
Mums have a sixth sense about these things.

339
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,300
I see.

340
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,200
What do you mean...by a sixth sense?

341
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,300
I don't think I need to explain that, do I?

342
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,500
No, I guess not.

343
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,000
Wow. I'd really no idea.

344
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,400
Does Luke know? I mean...

345
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,200
Does he know that you know?

346
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,300
Ohhh, he's worried.

347
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,000
He snapped at me earlier.

348
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,200
He snapped at me too.

349
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,600
Ah well, it's difficult for him.

350
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,200
Yeah, I guess.

351
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,800
I know it's not an ideal situation, and...

352
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,900
well, maybe the whole thing will 
fall through of its own accord.

353
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,800
Are you sure?

354
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,500
Well, it can't be easy dating someone...

355
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,800
with a disability.

356
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
Sorry. What did you say?

357
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,200
Mina. Luke's worried about 
Mina's blindness, I know he is.

358
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,400
He gave me this whole speech earlier 
about how easy my life was,

359
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,800
and how I didn't have anything 
difficult to deal with,

360
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,500
and well, I suppose when you 
compare my life to hers, he's right.

361
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,400
Right. Let me get this 
straight. Your sixth sense...

362
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,100
tells you that Luke is worried 
about dating a blind woman?

363
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,100
Yeah.

364
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,500
Nothing else?

365
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,300
No.

366
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,300
Why? He's not on drugs, is he?

367
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,200
No, he's not.

368
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,700
He hasn't been eating much recently.

369
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,100
I'm not sure that makes you a smack-head.

1
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,400
I wish you'd have told me 
it was going to be like this.

2
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,600
These are my best trainers.

3
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,300
What exactly did you think it would be like?

4
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,800
It's a sewer.

5
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,800
I know you have the body beautiful, but, ah...

6
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,700
surely it functions like everybody else's, 
or do you pass pure perfumed piss?

7
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,400
Yeah, I bottle it and sell it down the market.

8
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,500
It's not like there's any money in smiting.

9
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,000
That is true.

10
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,400
I understand why you do what you 
do, Galvin. I know what drives you.

11
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,800
What's supposed to drive me?

12
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,700
My boot up your ass if you don't keep moving.

13
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,200
I love these conversations we have.

14
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,200
Luke...I ma cross with you, but...

15
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,600
I just have to tell you about this 
conversation I had with your mum.

16
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,100
She is a legend.

17
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,900
You see, that's the problem... 

18
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,300
Things...happen, and I always just 
want to talk to you about them.

19
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,700
We should...talk, there are...

20
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,300
things I have to say.

21
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,900
Things I probably should 
have said a long time ago.

22
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
I'm going to come find you, OK?

23
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,600
It doesn't make sense.

24
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,200
This is where Mina said.

25
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,600
This is it exactly. 

26
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,000
Did we take a wrong turn?

27
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,600
There are no other turns!

28
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,900
All right. Calm down. We'll find him.

29
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,100
Hopefully before he finds us.

30
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,100
That is unlikely.

31
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,800
Mina doesn't make mistakes.

32
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,400
Unless...

33
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,800
Unless?

34
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,200
Yeah, Tibbs is here.

35
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,300
Or he wants us to think he's here.

36
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,000
He wanted us to find the handkerchief.

37
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,900
Shoot.

38
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,300
Luke...

39
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,900
Luke.

40
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,900
You see, the thing is...

41
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,400
I'm an alien. I've been meaning to tell you.

42
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,900
It's no use. It's completely blocked.

43
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,700
It's completely blocked off 
because he knew we were coming.

44
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,400
It's a trap, Luke.

45
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,800
A rat trap, one might say.

46
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,400
Good evening, Mr Galvin.

47
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,700
Have I got you flustered?

48
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,900
What a predicament.

49
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,000
Still, as the saying goes, 
things could only get worse,

50
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,800
Or is it better?

51
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,200
Well, I've planned for them to get worse.

52
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,000
These London sewers may be old, 
but they really are rather sophisticated.

53
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,400
This chamber you're in, for 
example, is COMPLETELY isolated.

54
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,000
Really? You don't say?

55
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,600
There you've already worked that out.

56
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,700
But what you may not have realised is 
that little pool of water you're standing in

57
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,100
is about to rise.

58
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,000
You see, at peak times down here in the sewers,

59
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,500
all your little human friends 
are scurrying home from work,

60
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,800
going to the toilet, taking a shower.

61
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,200
All 11 million of them. That's one big shower.

62
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,400
Yes, very amusing, Mr Rutherford. 
You're a welcome addition to the team.

63
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,100
One big shower - as you 
so rightly point out - 

64
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,700
is exactly what you're about to experience.

65
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,900
I don't think so. We've got friends. 
People who know where we are.

66
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,900
Friends?

67
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,900
I'm not entirely familiar with the concept.

68
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,600
Oh! You mean that nice blind girl.

69
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,700
No. Sorry. She won't be arriving to help -

70
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,800
- You so much as put a fin
- I haven't! I promise!

71
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,400
Relax.

72
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:02,700
But...in 18 minutes and 32 seconds, she 
and the Stacks will be blown to smithereens.

73
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,300
It's a very impressive 
library that, by the way.

74
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,800
It won't be nearly so easy to 
catch half-lives without it.

75
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,000
But wait.

76
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,700
There won't be anyone left to catch half-lives.

77
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,900
Oh dear.

78
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,400
He's lying, right?

79
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,200
No, I fear Grace may not be as 
virtuous as the name suggests.

80
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,500
Oh, she was once.

81
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,400
After being stuck in your company for 
so many years, and locked up in a cage,

82
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,200
well, you managed to reduce her to 
what -a low-life, stinking little rat?

83
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,900
Just like yourself.

84
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,900
That hot-headed, sharp tongue of 
yours will get you killed, Mr Galvin.

85
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,500
As it did your wife!

86
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,100
Good night, children.

87
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,800
Sweet dreams.

88
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,100
Luke. You see, the thing is, 
we've been friends for ages.

89
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,200
Too long. I mean...

90
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,900
well, not too long, but...

91
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,000
just friends for too long.

92
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,900
And it's the just friends thing that I wanted...

93
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,000
Luke.

94
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,000
I want your body.

95
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,400
Mina?

96
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,200
Mina!

97
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,200
Mina! Mina!

98
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,800
Great. The only time I actually want you awake...

99
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,600
Mina!

100
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,000
Hi, it's Luke, Please leave a message.

101
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,200
Luke! I...

102
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,900
I think we've learnt one thing.

103
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,000
Mina's second sight is rubbish.

104
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,600
It's not entirely her fault.

105
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,000
I mean, what's the point if this is what happens?

106
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,600
If we ever get out of here...

107
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,400
Yeah, and she's still alive.

108
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,900
Here, hold this.

109
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,900
Think, Ruby.

110
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,700
Think, think, think.

111
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,500
Genius.

112
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,400
That's...

113
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
'Bingo'.

114
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,900
Bingo?

115
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,400
Keep calm.Keep calm.

116
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,000
Genius!

117
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,900
Explosive Devices. Bingo.

118
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,700
I take it there's nothing down there.

119
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,000
There's plenty down there.

120
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,700
All she had to do was check the facts. 
It would have taken five minutes.

121
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,800
- It's not Mina's fault.
- Then whose?

122
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,700
It's mine, OK?! It's my fault!

123
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,600
Mina was worried about what she was seeing.

124
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,700
She wanted more time to do 
research. I wouldn't let her.

125
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,000
She knew it was a trap?

126
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,400
Well, she didn't know.

127
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,800
She was suspicious.

128
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,000
Why did she let us come down here?

129
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,400
She didn't. I did.

130
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,200
I didn't take her advice.

131
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,400
I had to find him, Luke.

132
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,400
I just wanted him dead.

133
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,700
Yeah, well, it seems like 
the feeling's mutual.

134
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,100
Only he doesn't let his heart rule his head.

135
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,800
Your turn.

136
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,600
It would be a really good time for 
some scientific consensus, people!

137
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
??

138
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,300
"Extricate the bomb casing."

139
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,200
Done.

140
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,800
"Isolate the timing device." Done.

141
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,800
"Locate the power source."

142
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,700
Locate...the power source.

143
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,400
"There many different types of 
explosive..." blah, blah blah.

144
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,700
???

145
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,900
"Two wires...or four wires?"

146
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,800
Two wires...or four wires?

147
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,500
Two wires! We're cooking on gas.

148
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,300
"In the case of two wires... 
isolate and sever the red wire."

149
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,800
Since you came into my life, 
everything has gone wrong.

150
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,300
I'm 18 years old, Galvin, and I'm about to drown.

151
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,600
Does that mean anything to you?

152
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,400
Did you think about me when 
you decided to come down here?

153
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,800
No.

154
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,200
No. 

155
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,900
You never do.

156
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,300
You think I'm some kind of weapon.

157
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,200
Send Luke in.

158
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,400
We don't need to tell him what's going on.

159
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,300
I'll be the brains.

160
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,700
No, you're right.

161
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,800
I got Maggie killed and now 
I've done the same thing to us.

162
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,800
It wasn't Maggie's death 
that made me a smiter.

163
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,800
It's because I'm a smiter 
that she got killed.

164
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,800
We were on a mission. Me and your dad.

165
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,400
We were after a Type 15, a Loup Garou.

166
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,700
The closer I got, the more obsessed I became.

167
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,100
Some things don't change.

168
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,600
He led us around town but... 

169
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,500
we couldn't get a finger on him.

170
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,000
Maggie never even entered my head.

171
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,300
When I got home, she wasn't there.

172
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,200
There was a monogrammed handkerchief on the bed.

173
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,300
Tobias Tibbs.

174
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,000
It wasn't your fault, Galvin.

175
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,100
It was entirely my fault.

176
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
I took my eye off the ball.

177
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Now I've done it again.

178
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,900
Luke, ah...

179
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,500
I've only got time to make one phone 
call, so I'm making it to you.

180
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,600
I want to be cremated.

181
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,500
I...I don't know why I'm telling you that.

182
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,500
I'm about to be blown to smithereens 
and the chance of there being any...

183
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,600
Anyway...

184
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,100
there's something I want to tell you 
and there's only 30 seconds left.

185
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,700
Luke Rutherford, you're a prat.

186
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,500
You're a prat, but...

187
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,500
I love you.

188
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,100
Ohh, yes!

189
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,700
Yes! Yes!

190
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,900
Ruby, keep it down.

191
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,200
Mina, we're alive.

192
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
This - was a bomb.

193
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,300
Where's Galvin?

194
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,900
I've no idea.

195
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,500
And Luke?

196
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,200
Oh, Luke.

197
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,100
I have a horrible feeling 
I know exactly where they are.

198
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,500
Caught up in one big rat trap.

199
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,300
What do you think will happen?

200
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,100
What, to the world?

201
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,900
No. Forget the world.

202
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,400
To us.

203
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,000
We're going to drown.

204
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,800
Yeah.

205
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,900
Yeah, but...what will actually happen?

206
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,100
I've no idea.

207
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,100
You know, Luke, um...

208
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,300
I know you don't think too highly 
of me right now, but, ah...

209
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,200
If we're going to die...

210
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,100
there's one thing I want you to know.

211
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,100
We probably haven't got that long.

212
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,000
I do care about you.

213
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,400
It may not seem that way, but it's true.

214
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,700
You just have a funny way of showing it.

215
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,700
What do you want, birthday cards?

216
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,100
Little chocolate rabbits at Easter? What?

217
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:03,300
You know, your whole life I've been 
watching you. Soccer matches, judo bouts...

218
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,300
Even choir practice.

219
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,200
Oh no.

220
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,100
Yeah, that was a mistake.

221
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,600
You've been following me for 18 years.

222
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,400
I lost count. I hoped it would come 
across as caring rather than creepy.

223
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,700
It doesn't.

224
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,700
I knew one day that they'd find you.

225
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,500
If they were going to hurt you, 
they'd have to hurt me first.

226
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
When they turned up at your school...

227
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,300
I was there.

228
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,800
I know.

229
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,900
I made a promise that, ah...

230
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,900
I'd never let anything happen to you.

231
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,800
It's kind of ironic then.

232
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,700
Yeah, well, we're...

233
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,500
we're not big on irony back home.

234
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,900
Sorry, am I going too fast for you?

235
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,500
Ruby...

236
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,100
I wanted to say thank you.

237
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,100
You saved my life.

238
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,400
I just smiled at you, by the way. 
In case you couldn't tell.

239
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,900
???

240
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,100
This is going to have to be 
a pretty swift vision, Mina.

241
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,900
What can you see? Can you feel anything?

242
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,100
Mina, really, really, we need to hurry up now.

243
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,200
Tibbs was here.

244
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,400
Yeah, I could have worked that out for myself.

245
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,300
Mina, I...I really need 
you to do something...??

246
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,000
I'm trying.

247
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,000
He was here...

248
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,100
- ??
- ??

249
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,700
Have you got it? ??

250
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,000
Exactly here.

251
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,000
??

252
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,500
What's happening?

253
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,300
Oh, we did it.

254
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,800
Now give that damn signal.

255
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,000
Well, you guys really are in the sh...

256
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,100
Yes, thank you, Ruby.

257
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,500
OK?

258
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,300
Right.

259
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,400
What?

260
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,700
Nothing...

261
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,600
Good night?

262
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,400
I'm sorry I snapped at you before.

263
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,100
I had stuff on my mind.

264
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,900
It's what I'm here for.

265
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,800
You are just like your father, you know.

266
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,900
Handsome? Witty? Intelligent?

267
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
No.

268
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,600
You smell...

269
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,600
strange.

270
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,200
He used to do that. He used to rock 
up in the middle of the night, 

271
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,500
smelling strange...with no explanation.

272
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,800
You don't want an explanation.

273
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,600
That is exactly what he used to say.

274
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,200
Why did you put up with it?

275
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,300
It wasn't a case of putting up with it.

276
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,800
It was just him.

277
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,300
All part of the deal.

278
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,900
You didn't want him to change?

279
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,500
I wouldn't go that far.

280
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,500
But you loved him anyway?

281
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,500
Yeah.

282
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,300
And whatever he did to make him smell that bad...

283
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,000
He loved you too.

284
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,700
Yeah.

285
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,600
Do you miss him?

286
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,400
Of course.

287
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,200
But you're glad you had him. I mean...

288
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,800
even though he was never there and...

289
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,100
he put you in danger, and he smelled bad.

290
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,600
I don't think he ever put me in danger.

291
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,000
You never knew?

292
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,200
What?

293
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,000
Then it didn't matter.

294
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,800
Luke...

295
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,500
Then it is possible.

296
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,200
Thanks, Mum.

297
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,700
Luke...

298
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,000
Are you on drugs?

299
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,800
No.

300
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,000
Are you OK?

301
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,100
I'm glad he didn't do that to 
Maggie. I'm glad she died quickly.

302
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,800
Does that sound strange?

303
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,000
No.

304
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,500
So are you going to let this go now?

305
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,100
Is he dead yet?

306
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,900
I've had enough of vengeance.

307
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,600
For now, anyway.

308
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,700
Are you sure you showered properly?

309
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,700
Like 10 times.

310
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,400
Well, maybe take a bath or... 
get a new layer of skin?

311
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,700
Here. I got you a new phone.

312
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,100
Thank you.

313
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,400
Well, Ruby...

314
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,300
I guess you saved the day.

315
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,300
It was nothing. 

316
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,600
OK then.

317
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,900
Well...obviously, it wasn't entirely 
nothing. I did rescue you all.

318
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,600
You did a good job. I'm very proud of you.

319
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,300
'I just have to tell you about this 
conversation I had with your mum.'

320
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,700
Hey, Ruby.

321
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,800
So does that mean that you'll 
be happy to have me around?

322
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,200
Let's not get carried away, huh?

323
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,000
Hey, Ruby.

324
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,500
Have you been talking to my mum?

325
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,600
- What?
- You left me a message.

326
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,400
What's my mum been saying?

327
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,900
Oh, wait, I've got another.

328
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,100
'Luke Rutherford, you're a prat.'

329
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,000
You called me a prat.

330
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,400
- '...I love you.'
- Really?

331
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,100
Well, I always think clearly under 
pressure. That's why you need me.

332
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,600
There are vampires in town.

333
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,900
Why would I lie to you?

334
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,100
Why are we watching Mina? 

335
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,900
She's been here longer than you think.

336
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,000
I need to know what it says about Mina. 

337
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,300
She's a boring bitch we can do without.

338
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,900
He's the last Van Helsing. He'll 
have to fight vampires sometime.

339
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,100
Join me.

340
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,300
Galvin! Galvin!

341
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:17,400
