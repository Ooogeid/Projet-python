00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,000
What have you got for us, Boris?

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,300
It's a teenage boy. Found 
in Greenwich Park last night.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,100
It's a messy one.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,100
It's the messy ones we're 
interested in, my friend.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,500
Give us a moment to pay our respects, Boris.

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,200
Do your thing, Mina.

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,300
What is it?

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,300
It was Luke.

9
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,500
It looked like he was dead.

13
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,500
I save Mina from being blown up. 

14
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,900
I save you and Galvin from drowning in a sewer.

15
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,800
No chocolates, no flowers, nothing.

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,100
I don't think Galvin's big on thank yous.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,900
What's she staring at?

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Nice. Very subtle.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,800
Who is she? I've never seen her before.

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,700
Would you put your tongue away?

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,100
Maybe she's staring cos 
she likes what she sees. 

22
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,700
Oh, please!

23
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Yeah?

24
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,300
Watch this.

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
I wouldn't if I were you. 

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,800
I swear that's been there since last week.

27
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,800
Lasagne on a Monday. Are you crazy?

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,700
They take all the meat 
from last week, mince it up.

29
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,200
That's what's in your lasagne.

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,900
In your expert opinion, is 
there anything safe to eat? 

31
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,300
In this place? Forget it.

32
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,300
So, why are you in the queue?

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,300
I'm thirsty.

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,700
I think I'm dehydrated.

35
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,400
Baked potato. Hmm, good choice.

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Haven't seen you around before. New, yeah?

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,800
Can I sit with you?

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,800
This whole thing about the 
food, the charming, witty banter,

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,500
do you practise it? 

40
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,400
No.

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,700
Trust me. 

42
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,700
You really need to.

43
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,800
Seriously...

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,100
Professor Lambert.

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,000
Hi. 

46
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,500
Rupert Galvin.

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Mina Harker.

48
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,000
We spoke on the phone with regard to 
this pictogram and what it might mean.

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,300
It looks like Sumerian.

50
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,900
Sumerian? Really? I'm not
 familiar with Sumerian?

51
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,800
Not many people are.

52
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,100
It's a Middle Eastern language. 
It dates from about 2500BC.

53
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,000
Do you think you could find your 
way around translating it for me?

54
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,400
Well, I can certainly give it a try. 

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,700
Thank you.

56
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,300
Attractive, isn't she? 

57
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,600
Very.

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,300
Here we go.

59
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,100
It symbolises vengeance or revenge.

60
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,800
But it's more specific than that.

61
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,200
It's avenging an act perpetrated 
against a member of your family

62
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,000
and the vengeance must be paid in blood.

63
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,500
Every half-life that's ever crawled through 
a sewer is gonna be baying for Luke's blood. Step.

64
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,600
Well, that narrows it down.

65
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,500
I think it's time we went 
to pay old big ears a visit.

66
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,900
Charming.

67
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,800
This place stinks.

68
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Hello, Luggs. 

69
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,000
You. 

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,500
What do you want?

71
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,800
I wanna know if you've heard 
anything about Luke Van Helsing.

72
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,000
What's the word around the sewers?

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,100
There is no word. I don't hear nothing!

74
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,100
Now, that's the problem.

75
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,500
You stop hearing things, you 
start losing your privileges.

76
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,500
You're just another half-life 
who needs grading and smiting.

77
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,200
Are you hearing this?

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,900
There's nothing to hear. 

79
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,600
What do you want me to do?

80
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,600
Leave the equipment alone!

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,900
Get off! Don't touch my ears.

82
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,400
There is one thing. I did hear one thing.

83
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,100
Really? Talk.

84
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,400
I did hear a rumour that someone's 
after the Van Hesling boy.

85
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,100
- Helsing.
- Who?

86
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,800
Well, it's just talk. I don't know.

87
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,300
Let me ask around and I'll give you a call.

88
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,600
You find out who it is for me...

89
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,000
..or I'm gonna slice you up and 
turn you into a dwarf salami.

90
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,000
Hey, what's up? 

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,900
I was in the neighbourhood. 
Thought you might like a ride home.

92
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,300
Cos that sounds like 
the sort of thing you do.

93
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,600
It's 100 metres.

94
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,500
Come on, admit it, you were missing me.

95
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,900
No. Race you.

96
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,600
I won.

97
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,900
How's college?

98
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,400
Something is definitely up.

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,100
It's not a complicated question.

100
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,000
It's you. You're making small
talk. You don't do small talk.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,200
You have no idea of the 
things I do and don't do.

102
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,000
I didn't know we were dating.

103
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,900
That is a really horrible thought.

104
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,500
Have you noticed any half-life 
activity? Seen anything suspicious?

105
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,100
Here we go. 

106
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,700
I ain't seen a thing.

107
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,500
What's going on?

108
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,300
Well, there's a rumour going round 
that a half-life's coming after you.

109
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,700
I'm the last Van Helsing.
Aren't they always after me?

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,200
This is different.So 
I want you to stay home.

111
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,900
You lock your doors and 
don't go out for anything.??

112
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,600
See, now you've got me worried.

113
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,300
Well, it's just a precaution till
we know what we're dealing with. 

114
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,500
OK.

115
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,100
Oh, Luke,

116
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,300
if you see anything suspicious, you let me know.

117
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,600
Are you all right, goddess?

118
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,700
???

119
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,000
??

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,300
I'm not gonna lend you my 
phone. You'll nick it.

121
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,600
You're calling me a thief, yeah?

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,900
Don't make me hurt you.

123
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,000
I know kung fu.

124
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
- Come on, then.
- Get off!

125
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,700
- Show me your moves.
- Get off!

126
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
You know nothing. 

127
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,300
Lads, seriously, three of 
you hassling one girl?

128
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,900
Is that not a bit embarrassing? 

129
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,000
Is it?

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,400
And what are you gonna do about it?

131
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,600
I know kung fu. 

132
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,100
Man, what is this?

133
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,400
Are you two in some kung fu club or something?

134
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,200
No, seriously, I know kung fu.

135
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,100
Actually, it's more a blend 
of various martial arts.

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Who is this guy?

137
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
How about we all just walk away, yeah?

138
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,500
You three go that way and we'll 
go this way. How about it?

139
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
I'm gonna mess you up, man.

140
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
I told you I could do kung fu.

141
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,800
You all right?

142
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,800
Hi. I'm Luke. From the 
canteen? The thirsty guy.

143
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,800
Which way are you going? I'll walk you there.

144
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,300
So I didn't get your name? 

145
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,800
That's cos I never said it.

146
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,300
Right. So what is it?

147
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,900
Look, you really don't have to walk me home. 

148
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,000
It's fine.

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So, how come you just started at college? 

150
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,600
I just moved here.

151
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,300
If you need someone to show you 
round, I'll be your tour guide.

152
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,800
I'm from up north, but I know pretty much 
everything there is to know about London.

153
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,900
OK, so what's that building?

154
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,900
I have absolutely no idea.

155
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,200
What about that one, do 
you know what that is?

156
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,400
Nope. 

157
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,300
That one?

158
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,900
Well, it's not Buckingham Palace.

159
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,300
Some tour guide you are. 

160
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,400
Hey, at least I know Kung Fu.

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,300
I have to go.

162
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,000
So what is your name?

163
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,000
It's Alice. 

164
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,200
See you at college, Alice.

165
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,000
Hello, Luggs.

166
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,300
"This better be good."

167
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, it is.

168
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,800
"I'm on my way." 

169
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,500
See you in an hour.

170
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,900
"OK."

171
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,500
- You know the place?
- "Yeah."

172
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,300
Yeah.

173
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,500
Luggs?

174
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,400
You fungus-faced dwarf.

175
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,800
You don't want to keep me waiting, my friend.

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,900
- Oh, dear.
- What is it?

177
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,000
It's Luggs.

178
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,000
He's toast.

179
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,100
Rupert...

180
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,900
Mina, run!

181
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,500
What the hell was that?

182
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,400
Alice!

183
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

184
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,900
How's things? 

185
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,500
Any more trouble on the mean 
streets of London town?

186
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,100
No.

187
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,700
Are you doing anything later? 
I thought maybe we could go out.

188
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,500
I've got plans.

189
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,500
- Tomorrow?
- I'm busy.

190
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,300
- Thursday?
- I can't.

191
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,100
How about the weekend?

192
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,300
OK. I get the message.

193
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,100
I'm going now before this 
gets any more embarrassing.

194
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,300
Luke!

195
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,900
Meet me here, five o'clock. 

196
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,100
I thought you had plans?

197
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,200
I guess they just changed.

198
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,100
I thought I told you to stay home? 

199
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,500
I've got to hand in an essay.

200
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:05,000
That makes me feel so much better, knowing you 
risked your life to stay on top of your homework.

201
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,300
Get in.

202
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
What's this? 

203
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,900
This is your new home.

204
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
You've got to be kidding? 

205
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,800
Do I look like I'm kidding?

206
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,500
Last night, we had a close encounter 
with the half-life that's after you.

207
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,400
Staying here is the only way 
we can guarantee your safety.

208
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,500
It's only until we find it.

209
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,800
Look, I'll stay at home. I won't go to 
college. I won't go out. I'll do anything. 

210
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,000
But I won't live down here.

211
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,800
That is a really dumb move, Luke. 

212
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,300
Yeah, well, it's my life.

213
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,700
You don't have a life. You have 
a job. You're no use to us dead.

214
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm sorry to hear my death would 
be such an inconvenience to you.

215
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,300
Ruby, it's Galvin.

216
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,700
I've got a little job for you.

217
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,000
Hiya. What's up? You wanna 
hang out? I've got pizza.

218
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,200
What?

219
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,400
Did Galvin tell you to keep an eye on me?

220
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
No.

221
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,900
Since when does Galvin 
ask me to do anything?

222
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,000
If you ask me, he's 
sexist. Let's watch telly.

223
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,700
No, I can't. 

224
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,400
Why not? Are you going out?

225
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,900
No. I've got college work to do. 

226
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,300
- I'll give you a hand.
- I don't need a hand. 

227
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,000
I just need to get on with it.

228
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,400
American hot with extra 
pepperoni. Your favourite.

229
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,700
I already ate.

230
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,400
Well, how about I watch telly 
while you do your work?

231
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,700
I can't concentrate with you here. 
Go eat your pizza somewhere else.

232
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,500
I can't eat all this by myself.

233
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,700
Do you know how many 
calories are in one of these? 

234
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't care.

235
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,700
Do you want me to get fat? 

236
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,000
Yes.

237
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
- See you.
- Killjoy.

238
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,800
Have you found anything yet?

239
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,900
Nothing so far.

240
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,500
OK, so we got a teenage 
boy killed in Greenwich Park.

241
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,700
Could be its hunting ground.

242
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,700
Maybe we should stake it out. 

243
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,200
We could always use Ruby as bait.

244
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,800
- It looks fine.
- Hi.

245
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,200
So Mr Tour Guide, what's the plan?

246
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,300
Do you want to go to the beach?

247
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,600
Come on.

248
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,500
That's it, I've found it.

249
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,700
It's a harpy.

250
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,700
Grade ten.

251
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,900
Nasty.

252
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,900
Why is it after Luke?

253
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,300
Do you want some sun block?

254
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,100
Does it look like I'm burning?

255
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,400
We should have brought our swimming stuff.

256
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,100
I'll get us some ice-creams.

257
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,400
???

258
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,100
??

259
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,800
fancy seeing you here.

260
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,100
I can't believe you lied to me.

261
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
You said you were doing 
college work. You lied to ME.

262
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,000
Because I didn't want you following me. 

263
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,900
This wasn't my idea.

264
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,000
I was just looking out for you.

265
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
So, is this like a date?

266
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,600
You're leaving right now. 

267
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,900
You can't make me. This is a public place.

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,200
So embarrassing!

269
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,700
You can tell Galvin he can't stop me living 
my life and if he wants to try, you know where I am.

270
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,100
Just take her anywhere away from here.

271
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,800
There you go. 

272
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,500
It's freezing.

273
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,700
- So?
- Oh, come here, you've got...

274
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,600
You are dead!

275
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,400
No! No!

276
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,600
Not in the water! It's cold, it's cold!

277
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,200
Say please.

278
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,700
Harpy - from the Latin Harpyia.

279
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,900
The ancient Greeks believed 
they were winged death spirits.

280
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,700
It says they're half-woman, half-beast.

281
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,500
Sometimes they're identified with sirens.

282
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,200
They target men and 
lure them to their death.

283
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,600
There were three harpies - 
Aello, Celaeno and Ocypete.

284
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,100
Sisters.

285
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,800
1554 - Pieter Van Helsing hunted 
and killed two of the harpies.

286
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,600
He burned them alive.

287
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
OK, so I'm guessing the remaining 
sister was pretty unhappy about that.

288
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,200
She's looking for some kind of payback.

289
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,000
Vengeance.

290
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,700
And Luke just so happens 
to be the last Van Helsing.

291
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,100
- What?
- Nothing.

292
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,200
You don't give much away, do you?

293
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,000
And you do?

294
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,600
Ask me anything you like.

295
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,400
OK.

296
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,100
Your parents - 

297
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,600
what do they do?

298
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
My mum's a teacher.

299
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,500
My dad died.

300
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
When I was one. A car crash.

301
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
You miss him, don't you?

302
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,200
I know it's silly,

303
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,500
missing someone you never knew.

304
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,100
No, it's not.

305
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,200
It's like I've got this sense of him.

306
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,800
I don't know if it's right or if 
it's how I like to think of him.

307
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,900
You feel empty.

308
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,200
Did you lose someone?

309
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,400
It was a long time ago.

310
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,700
I never really talk about this with anyone.

311
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,800
I'm glad you did.

312
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,000
In 1554, Pieter Van Helsing 
was called to Rotterdam.

313
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,700
He writes of the siren song of the 
harpy luring sailors to their death.

314
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,800
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

315
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,000
Well, I'll be damned. Mina.

316
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Before a harpy looks like a harpy,

317
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,600
it looks like a girl.

318
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,600
So a woman and a beast, but at different times.

319
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,100
That puts a whole new spin on 
things. We're looking for a girl.

320
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,100
What's with all the urgent messages?

321
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,900
What's going on?

322
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,900
The word is, you got 
yourself a new girlfriend.

323
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What, so now I'm not allowed a girlfriend?

324
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,300
Not this one. 

325
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,400
Alice isn't who she says she is.

326
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,000
What are you talking about?

327
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,700
We hacked into the college's system and 
checked her registration form. It's all lies.

328
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,900
You're spying on her? 

329
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,000
We can't find any trace of her parents.

330
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,600
No birth certificate, no 
National Insurance number.

331
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,300
It appears she came out of nowhere.

332
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,600
Maybe she uses her middle 
name. People do that.

333
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,300
Luke, your girlfriend's a half-life. 

334
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,600
What's this?

335
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,300
This is what she turns into.

336
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,400
Looks kinda different without her makeup, huh? 

337
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,600
This is insane.

338
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,300
Whatever this thing is, it's not 
Alice. Trust me, I'd know.

339
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,800
You wouldn't, not until it's too late.

340
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,900
You wanna take a look at what she can do?

341
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,300
There's a teenager lying on a slab 
in a morgue the other side of town.

342
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,800
Of all the girls in London, Alice 
just happens to be a harpy? Come on.

343
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,500
??It's not a coincidence. 
She's the thing after you.

344
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,300
Because a girl can't possibly fancy me. 

345
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,500
She's crazy about you. That's 
why she's planning on killing you.

346
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,700
So now she wants to kill me?

347
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Turns out there seems to be a bit 
of history between your families.

348
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,400
Pieter Van Helsing torched Alice's sisters. 
Now she's looking for some kind of revenge.

349
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,800
None of this proves Alice is a harpy.

350
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,400
You're absolutely right. That's
why we need to abduct her.

351
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,100
You're gonna abduct an 18-year-old? 

352
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,100
No, a 3000-year-old half-life.

353
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,000
Try it. You'll have to come through me first.

354
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,100
Well, this is intense. 

355
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,800
Stay away from her.

356
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,500
Luke! Wait!

357
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,300
Galvin's lost it. He's stepped over the line. 

358
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,200
Just hear me out. We've got a plan.

359
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,600
A plan that involves kidnapping the girl I'm seeing?

360
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,500
It's the only way we can be sure.

361
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,600
Look, Pieter Van Helsing discovered wormwood affects 
the central nervous system, kick-starting the transformation.

362
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,700
Fine. 

363
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,000
I'll give her some wormwood. Then we'll see.

364
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,300
???She needs to be restrained and in a 
secure environment when we give it to her.

365
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,000
We don't want anyone to get hurt. 

366
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,800
What about Alice?

367
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,900
- She could get hurt.
- It's the only way, Luke.

368
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,000
If she turns into a harpy, then...

369
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,300
we do what needs doing.

370
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,100
And if she doesn't?

371
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,500
We'll be very apologetic.

372
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
You're as bad as Galvin.

373
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,200
I saw something, Luke.

374
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I saw you lying on the 
ground. You were bleeding.

375
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,400
Was I dead?

376
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,800
I don't know.

377
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,300
Where do we find her?

378
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm meeting her at five o'clock 
at the entrance to Borough Market.

379
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,400
I don't want to be there when you do it.

380
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,400
OK, there's not too many people 
around when she shows up.

381
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,100
We'll put her in the back of the car. 

382
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,700
OK.

383
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

384
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,100
Come in.

385
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,600
I'll get us some drinks.

386
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,800
Is beer all right? 

387
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,300
Yeah, it's fine.

388
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,700
Do you wanna sit down over here?

389
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,000
Thanks.

390
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,200
Something about this doesn't feel right.

391
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,200
I'll give Luke a call.

392
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,200
I love your Mum's flat.

393
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,900
You can get it if you like. 

394
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,100
It's fine. They'll leave a message.

395
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,600
Are you OK? 

396
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,500
Yeah. Cool. Cheers.

397
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,300
Someone really wants to talk to you.

398
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,200
It's probably nothing. Ignore it.

399
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,700
Two seconds.

400
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,700
Hello.

401
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,300
No, you've got the wrong number.

402
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,100
Sorry about that.

403
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,300
Cheers.

404
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,100
Alice was never coming. Come on.

405
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,000
Where is she?

406
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,700
She's gone.

407
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,700
I spiked her drink.

408
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,700
You know what happened?

409
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,200
Nothing.

410
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,700
Nothing happened. 

411
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,500
You sent us off on some wild goose 
chase. You could've been killed. 

412
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,700
I wasn't. Cos Alice isn't a harpy.

413
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,600
You never lie to me 
again, you understand this?

414
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,000
You were gonna abduct her. 

415
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,800
Sure she drank this? Something's wrong.

416
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,400
Yeah, you were wrong.

417
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,100
Your feelings are messing with your 
judgement. You can't allow that to happen.

418
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,900
Maybe it's your feelings that 
are messing with your judgement. 

419
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,800
You ever think about that?

420
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,400
I am sorry a half-life killed your wife.

421
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,700
I can't be like you.

422
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,400
There's more to life 
than grading and smiting.

423
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,300
Not for me and you. It's all or nothing.

424
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,200
You're obsessed.

425
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,800
You see half-lifes even 
when they're not there.

426
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,800
Seriously, you should take some time out.

427
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
We don't have the luxury. We're fighting a war.

428
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,000
Alice isn't part of your war. 

429
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,100
Everyone's part of it. Most of 
them just don't know about it yet.

430
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,100
I think you should go.

431
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,200
???

432
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,800
Hello?

433
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,200
I'm from down the hall. Is 
everything all right in there?

434
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,600
I got your message. What's up?

435
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,400
You were right.

436
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,900
It was all lies.

437
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,200
Everything.

438
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,300
I'm so sorry.

439
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,200
I've never felt this way about a girl before.

440
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,900
She turns out to be a 
half-life who wants to kill me.

441
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,700
So this is my life.

442
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,300
No, she was just a lying harpy bitch.

443
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,400
It's always going to be like this.

444
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,900
I'll be lying to them or 
they'll be lying to me.

445
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,700
Mina said I'll never have a normal relationship.

446
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,500
She's right.

447
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,400
No.

448
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,000
You just got the wrong girl.

449
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
How can I expect anyone to be a part of this?

450
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,700
Maybe it's better I'm on my own.

451
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,400
The girl who's right for you, 
she'll accept you for who you are.

452
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,900
She'll always be there 
for you, no matter what.

453
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,100
Yeah?

454
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,200
Well, if you meet that 
girl, give her my number.

455
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,900
I've got to tell Galvin. 

456
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,900
He's gonna love this.

457
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,900
Galvin, it's me.

458
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,200
Alice is meeting me at the club at eight.

459
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,700
You want me to take a look at that?

460
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,600
Probably a bit of dirt jamming 
up the cocking mechanism.

461
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
It causes friction.

462
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,600
Friction...

463
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,900
..is bad.

464
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,900
This is not gonna be easy for you, Luke. I know 
you like this girl. But it has to be done.

465
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,200
You sure you don't wanna sit this one out?

466
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,300
I have to do this.

467
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,700
She's here. She's coming in.

468
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,700
OK, Luke, let's get the job done and get outta 
here. This place is making me feel kinda old.

469
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,700
Hi.

470
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,900
??

471
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,300
- You look amazing.
- Thanks.

472
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,800
Let's go this way.

473
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,200
You know, it's girls like her 
that give women a bad reputation.

474
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,100
If only he could find a nice
girl to settle down with.

475
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,400
- I got you a beer.
- Thanks.

476
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,600
So, whose party is this?

477
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,200
I know.

478
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,700
I know what you are.

479
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,500
The body in your kitchen
 kind of gave it away.

480
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,900
My friends say you came to kill me.

481
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,200
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

482
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,900
If you're planning on killing a guy 
after the second date, tell him why.

483
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,000
A Van Helsing killed my sisters.

484
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,000
So you were going to kill a Van Helsing?

485
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,300
Yeah.

486
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,100
Pretty much.

487
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,200
I can't let you keep on killing.

488
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,700
It ends now.

489
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,100
You're going to kill me?

490
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,000
You can do that?

491
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,400
Not while you're like this.

492
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,900
You spiked my beer?

493
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,200
I'm going to wait until you turn.

494
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,400
I'm sorry.

495
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,700
What are you doing?

496
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,100
Get on with it. 

497
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,800
Do it now.

498
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,600
I can't. 

499
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,100
Not like this.

500
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,900
OK, get out of the way.

501
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,700
- We wait. 
- I said, get out of the goddamn...

502
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,800
Get after her.

503
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,500
Mina, Ruby, we've lost her.

504
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,300
Cover the front entrance.

505
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,600
You look great.

506
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,400
Alice?

507
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,300
So this is it.

508
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,400
I have to be suspicious of 
every girl I meet from now on.

509
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,200
So what's new?

510
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,900
They're always trying to hide something.

511
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,700
You know, Ruby thinks you're sexist. 

512
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,000
Really?

513
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,100
Well, she thinks you're cute.

514
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,300
So she's obviously wrong about most things.

515
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,600
Just give me a minute.

516
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,500
I get nightmares.

517
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,200
Beware of something nasty 
pretending to be something nice.

518
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,500
What else have you heard, Sandy? 

519
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,800
He's been talking to mediums.

520
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,800
Dad? 

521
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,400
What are you up to?

522
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,800
Drop the ball!

523
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,100
You're the last Van Helsing. 

524
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,100
Denial is not an option.

525
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,700
Can I trust you?

526
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,900
Let's call it by its name. You killed him.

527
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,200
It's my turn. 

528
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,400
