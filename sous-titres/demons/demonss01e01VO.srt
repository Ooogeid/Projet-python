1
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:08,962
They're not paying you enough
for this.

2
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:11,528
Well, it's the same each term.
My room.

3
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:14,225
Oh, there's this. Sorry.

4
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:15,966
Dr Graham?

5
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:18,639
Sorry!

6
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,089
# Who's cooking monsters
in the kitchen

7
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,030
# Who keeps a knife tucked in
her garter

8
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,984
# Who keeps you nervous

9
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:45,011
# Like screaming motorcycles

10
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,784
# You keep the fires burning

11
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:50,652
# I'll keep the water running

12
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:56,235
# We'll know it's over
when they turn out the lights #

13
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:10,754
There's been a break-in
at his high school.

14
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,777
Type Three, I'd say.

15
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,313
The secretary must have
disturbed it.

16
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:17,520
Well, she didn't say. She's dead.

17
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:22,287
We're compromised, we're compromised
to hell. They know where he lives.

18
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,120
OK. Gotta go.

19
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,333
Show time.

20
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,751
Welcome to the Dark Ages.

21
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:13,009
Mum?

22
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,201
Oh...

23
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,160
Well, hi. You must be Luke.

24
00:03:37,454 --> 00:03:39,791
- What are you doing?
- Did I wake you?

25
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,899
I can't get the damned
ice machine to work.

26
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
Sorry. I'm Galvin. Rupert Galvin.

27
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,451
Can I get you anything?

28
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,414
There's no word in the English
language

29
00:03:53,497 --> 00:03:55,876
to describe the correct
state of the perfect omelette.

30
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,167
It's all to do with internal
temperature.

31
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,800
Neither raw nor cooked.
Like this. See?

32
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:03,706
The French...
Thanks.

33
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:05,384
... have a word for it.

34
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:06,840
Baveuse.

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,139
Don't you love it?

36
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:10,255
Do they have a word for
someone who stays away

37
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:12,260
for years and years and
doesn't even write?

38
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:15,240
Idiot. The same in English.
What can I say? I'm sorry, Jenny.

39
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,879
Well. It doesn't matter.

40
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:19,638
You're here now. And it's
a wonderful surprise.

41
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
- How long are you in town?
- Oh, a while.

42
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,119
You know, I haven't slept
in 36 hours.

43
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:25,433
Where are you staying?

44
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:28,099
You could stay here. Rupert...
could stay here, couldn't he?

45
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:30,582
No, it's fine.
I have a reservation at Compton's Hotel.

46
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:31,920
Have you heard of it?

47
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:34,806
Ah... yes, I have. It's down by
Southwark Bridge.

48
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:37,372
OK. I need some sleepee.

49
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,642
I would drive you over there but
school's

50
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:42,197
in the opposite direction,
I'm afraid. Sorry.

51
00:04:42,594 --> 00:04:43,920
Maybe Luke could take me.

52
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,568
Yes. Why not?

53
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,835
Good idea.

54
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:49,021
Go to the corner. Grab a cab.

55
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:50,603
Let him finish his breakfast.

56
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:52,356
He never eats breakfast.

57
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,558
Mum!

58
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,838
I've got stuff to do.

59
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,266
Who is this guy anyway?

60
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,923
Mum?

61
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:05,981
- Something you want to tell me?
- No.

62
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:07,746
He's your boyfriend.

63
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:09,278
Rupert is not my boyfriend.

64
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:11,477
Yeah, yeah!
Who is he, then?

65
00:05:12,284 --> 00:05:13,795
He's your godfather.

66
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,557
You're kidding.

67
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,720
You know, I knew your father.

68
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,636
Did your mom tell you?

69
00:05:24,187 --> 00:05:25,915
Yeah, we were good friends.

70
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:29,957
Yes, indeed. It was a bad time
when we lost him.

71
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,543
A very bad time.

72
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:35,840
Do you ever see things, Luke?

73
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,520
Do you ever see things?

74
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:43,280
- What kind of things?
- Oh, I don't know.

75
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:45,602
Out of the corner of your eye.

76
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:48,443
But when you look...

77
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,612
they're not there.

78
00:06:05,777 --> 00:06:07,630
How about, you and me...

79
00:06:07,955 --> 00:06:09,841
tonight, boys'night out.
What do you say?

80
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:11,157
I can't. Sorry.

81
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:13,198
- I've got to be somewhere.
- Cancel.

82
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:14,525
She'll understand.

83
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,037
- I assume it's a she.
- It's not like that. It's a party.

84
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,275
But you're not planning
on going home alone, right?

85
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:20,220
I like you.

86
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:22,200
Tonight, my friend,
the ladies can wait.

87
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:24,360
Your godfather has spoken.

88
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,960
7:30, Royal Festival Hall.
Meet me.

89
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,592
Good.

90
00:06:31,044 --> 00:06:32,440
Oh, and, ah... Luke.

91
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:37,450
Don't open it until you get home.

92
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:38,981
And if you do see anything...

93
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:40,825
take care.

94
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:43,302
Remember - they bite.

95
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:50,482
- Hiya.
- Ruby.

96
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:52,200
- Can we talk?
- Yeah?

97
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,525
You know this party?

98
00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:56,788
- The one we're going to tonight.
- Yeah. I've got a problem.

99
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,280
Oh. OK.

100
00:06:58,677 --> 00:06:59,720
What's happened?

101
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,029
This guy turned up. He was a friend
of my dad's.

102
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:04,052
Apparently, he's my godfather.

103
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:05,760
He wants a boys'night out.

104
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,157
- You're joking.
- Listen... I've got your art folder.

105
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,397
- Do you need it?
- Bring it into college with you.

106
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,800
No, I'll stay here to work,
I have the place to myself.

107
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,800
Well, I could come to yours
and get it?

108
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,501
- OK. Cool.
- See ya.

109
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:28,119
I thought we had rats,
but it was big.

110
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:29,480
More like a monkey.

111
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,041
You've got monkeys!

112
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:34,080
Wow. Well, there goes
the neighbourhood.

113
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:35,778
It ate our mop.

114
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:38,632
Mmmm. You should call the council.

115
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:41,480
They have men in vans to deal with
this kind of thing.

116
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,760
Forget it. Listen.

117
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,510
I'm sorry about tonight.

118
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:45,723
It's OK.

119
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:48,197
No, it's not. It's Amber's birthday.
I said I'd go.

120
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,350
She'll be off her face by half 10.

121
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:52,320
She'll never know.

122
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,927
You won't be missing much anyway.

123
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,755
It was rubbish last year.

124
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,280
"Abraham V.H."

125
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,135
- Who's he?
- No idea.

126
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,549
And what about J and R?

127
00:10:08,582 --> 00:10:10,470
R's Rupert. My godfather.

128
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,745
J's my dad.

129
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:14,791
See? 1990. The year I was born.

130
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:17,320
The year he died.

131
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:19,353
Old Abraham was the look of him.

132
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:20,830
See a family resemblance?

133
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:23,342
Er... maybe. Apart from the beard.

134
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,469
"The new V.H." The little sprog.
Is that you?

135
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:29,238
I suppose - so.

136
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:31,158
I'll find out.

137
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:12,171
Pardon me. Thank you.

138
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,800
Excuse me, ma'am. Thank you.

139
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,895
Mina!

140
00:11:15,736 --> 00:11:17,360
- Rupert!
- Mina.

141
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,544
- You were amazing.
- You didn't tell me you were coming.

142
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:22,397
No, I'm a wild, impetuous guy.

143
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:25,507
Somebody I'd like you to meet.
Mina Harker, this is Luke.

144
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:27,411
Luke Rutherford. Hi.

145
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:42,695
Mina, your fans are waiting.
We got to move along here.

146
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:53,040
Seeing is believing, Luke.

147
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:56,120
You must believe even when it seems
impossible.

148
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,993
Thank you, Mina.

149
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,666
You were fabulous. As ever.

150
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:03,200
Through here, come on.

151
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,910
Beautiful girl, huh?

152
00:12:06,147 --> 00:12:07,763
I didn't realise she was...

153
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:10,458
Blind? Don't let that fool you.
Mina's unique.

154
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:12,204
Very special.

155
00:12:15,582 --> 00:12:17,744
I've been seeing really weird stuff.

156
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:19,867
I was attacked...

157
00:12:20,514 --> 00:12:22,518
by a... a monkey thing.

158
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:25,313
And there was a creepy-looking guy
watching the place.

159
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:26,694
And who is Abraham?

160
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:28,859
You know you asked me what I did?

161
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,954
Well, the truth is...

162
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:33,287
I'm a warrior.

163
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,080
You're a warrior?

164
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:38,094
You're joking, right?

165
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:40,506
So was your old man
and so was Abraham.

166
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:44,273
All of us warriors in the coldest
of cold wars.

167
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,728
The struggle between human
and inhuman.

168
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:49,653
Us and them.

169
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:55,801
It's people like us keep the freaks
in their place,

170
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:57,935
down in the half-lif
where they belong.

171
00:12:58,018 --> 00:12:58,840
Freaks?

172
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:02,218
What are you talking about?
Who are these people?

173
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:05,384
They're not people. What I'm
talking about are inhumans.

174
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,346
A different species.

175
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:09,207
Supernatural beings.

176
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,211
You know, in most cities you're
never more than 20 feet from a rat.

177
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:19,860
They outnumber the human population
seven to one.

178
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:21,600
How often do you see them?

179
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,218
Inhumans are the same.

180
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,720
- Whether you see them or not.
- They exist?

181
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,176
Oh, they exist all right. You know
they exist. You've seen them.

182
00:13:29,694 --> 00:13:31,160
Like vampires and werewolves?

183
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,863
We don't care to name them.

184
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,768
We just grade'em and smite'em.

185
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,760
You smite them?

186
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,703
Oh, yes, sir. With extreme
prejudice.

187
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:41,566
Swiftly and surely.

188
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:43,744
Like the wrath of God.

189
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,200
Cheers.

190
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:06,160
You asked about Abraham.

191
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,162
Abraham Van Helsing, of Leyden,
Holland.

192
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,415
Rutherford is Jenny's name.

193
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:13,510
Your daddy's name was Van Helsing.

194
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:17,184
Come on, you are taking the piss.

195
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,969
You're saying I'm related to some
character from a book.

196
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:22,538
Identity theft. Bram Stoker
stole your name.

197
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:24,533
Now if it was me, I'd be mad
as hell.

198
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:25,864
I think I'm going home.

199
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,556
I have stuff I could be doing.

200
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,301
You think he invented Van Helsing?

201
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:31,597
I'm guessing no?

202
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,582
Abraham Van Helsing was real.

203
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,080
Come on, drink up. I'll show you.

204
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:49,480
Is everything all right, sir?

205
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,940
Do you want your bill?

206
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:06,571
- You know this place?
- Smithfield. It's a market.

207
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,149
Meat market.

208
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:11,056
It had a cold store
deep underground.

209
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:14,194
In 200 years, the ice never melted.

210
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,039
Perma-frost.

211
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:21,269
It took the construction guys
months to thaw it out.

212
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,680
- Do you know what they found?
- McDonald's?

213
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:26,595
Rivers, boy.

214
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:28,455
Rivers.

215
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:35,179
The Flaxman and the Hawk.

216
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:38,000
People thought they'd dried up
in the Middle Ages.

217
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,510
But nothing changes.

218
00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:42,780
The old waters still flow.

219
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:46,081
Will this take long?

220
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,240
Not long.

221
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:49,969
Why, you got someone
waiting for you?

222
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:52,560
- No. I've got revision to do.
- Schoolwork.

223
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,426
Well, sorry.

224
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:56,579
That's what goes on.

225
00:15:56,888 --> 00:15:58,642
You know,
up there in the real world.

226
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,651
What are you doing?

227
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:06,597
- Pulse gun.
- You could have killed me!

228
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,960
Works on microwaves. Everything has
its perfect internal temperature.

229
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,777
Like an omelette.
Exactly.

230
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,701
For an entity, it's about 30 below.

231
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:15,279
Warms'em up pretty good, huh?

232
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:17,480
Anything from a Type Seven,
Eight, maybe.

233
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,214
- Then what?
- Then we're after big numbers.

234
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:21,811
What was that monkey thing?

235
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:24,320
Type Three. Small potatoes.
Forget about it.

236
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,630
Is this an entity?

237
00:16:25,713 --> 00:16:27,370
No, Luke, that is a rat.

238
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:29,739
No, Luke, that is a rat.

239
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,842
What?

240
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,486
The locket.

241
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,112
Ready?

242
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,198
- You got it?
- No.

243
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:54,915
One more time, it locks us out.
Use the force, Luke.

244
00:16:55,124 --> 00:16:56,263
Yeah, very funny.

245
00:16:56,346 --> 00:16:57,178
Ready.

246
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,294
Did you get it that time?

247
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:09,840
- I think so.
- Good.

248
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,640
Shazzam.

249
00:17:42,305 --> 00:17:44,500
The library of Abraham Van Helsing.

250
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:48,355
The world's number one authority
on inhuman life forms.

251
00:17:49,378 --> 00:17:50,976
We call them the Stacks.

252
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:53,953
It kinda works, doesn't it?

253
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:14,002
What?

254
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,317
Built for keeps. State of the art
in the early 90s.

255
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,643
Hello, Luke.

256
00:18:23,021 --> 00:18:24,999
This is very strange for me.

257
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,601
I'm talking to you out there

258
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:28,579
and yet I'm got you right here
in my arms.

259
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:31,803
But if you are watching this,

260
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:33,972
it means we never really
got to know each other.

261
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,887
And I can't tell you how sorry I am.

262
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,294
Everything you see
around you is yours.

263
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:41,800
Use it wisely.

264
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:44,369
Good luck, Luke.

265
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:47,160
The time has come to act.

266
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:57,840
What happened?

267
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:01,755
Mum said it was an accident
on a business trip.

268
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,225
It was business.

269
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:06,109
There is no accident.

270
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:08,508
The freaks got him.

271
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,220
Were you there?

272
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:12,367
Yes.

273
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:19,624
- Does Mum know about any of this?
- No, and she never will.

274
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:21,039
Not from me anyway.

275
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:24,479
It was a car smash. End of story.

276
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,028
Me and your daddy, we tried
so hard to...

277
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:31,388
... to keep you both out of it.

278
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,679
Is that why you went away?

279
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:38,399
You said you had your reasons.

280
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:43,952
Yeah, believe me it wasn't easy.
I know Jenny was hurt, but...

281
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:47,003
Well, it would have made you
a target too.

282
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:47,886
Me?

283
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,520
Luke...

284
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:52,870
Last night your school
was broken into.

285
00:19:52,953 --> 00:19:54,978
Today a Type Three shows up
at your apartment.

286
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,037
Now I don't think that's
coincidence.

287
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:01,440
Now they're on to you.
They know where you live.

288
00:20:06,951 --> 00:20:09,339
So I'm supposed to drop everything
and join the struggle,

289
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:11,638
start smiting entities?
Is that what you want?

290
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:14,065
It's not what I want.
Your cover's been blown wide open.

291
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,720
Like your old man said. The time
has come. You have no choice.

292
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,200
Everyone has a choice.

293
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,545
No. Other people have a choice,
you have a destiny.

294
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:24,080
You're the last Van Helsing.
Denial is not an option.

295
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:26,811
Incredible.

296
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,040
Did you ever ask yourself
how you do that?

297
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:32,460
Other people, they can't do that,
Luke.

298
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:33,877
It's in here.

299
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:35,880
In the genes. Talk tomorrow.

300
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:39,075
I don't think so, Mr Galvin.
We've talked enough.

301
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:41,495
You can't just hijack
someone's life, OK?

302
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:42,693
I have plans!

303
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:57,960
Hey! You came.

304
00:20:59,673 --> 00:21:01,953
- Yeah, better late than never.
- How's the godfather?

305
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:03,307
Weird.

306
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:04,875
Deeply weird.

307
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,691
I'll tell you later.
How's the party?

308
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:07,742
Hi, Luke.

309
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,071
Hello, Amber.

310
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,574
Where have you been hiding?

311
00:21:10,657 --> 00:21:11,784
He just got here.

312
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:14,296
Then you've got some
catching up to do.

313
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,008
Urrgh! Great!

314
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:27,095
Bet you wish you'd stayed
with Amber.

315
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:28,608
Forget it, we'll get a cab.

316
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:30,333
- I've got no money.
- Ruby!

317
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,896
Oh, God!

318
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:52,857
Listen to me!

319
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:56,761
What's up? What's up? What happened?

320
00:21:56,844 --> 00:21:58,768
Down there, there's a freak.
Grabbed at me!

321
00:21:58,994 --> 00:22:00,114
What sort of freak?

322
00:22:00,197 --> 00:22:03,166
I dunno - tall, teeth. Does it
matter? What are you - an expert?

323
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:07,739
All right...

324
00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:08,744
Lads?

325
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:11,352
Can you turn the lights on?

326
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,360
Come on.

327
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:12,188
I'm so proud!

328
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,878
What a hero!

329
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:16,707
Luke!

330
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,519
Someone wants to have a word
with you, Luke.

331
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:29,000
So be nice.

332
00:23:29,863 --> 00:23:30,798
Come quietly.

333
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,947
Let him go.

334
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,800
Do it now or I will most surely
smite thee, you freak.

335
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,050
Watch out!

336
00:23:57,827 --> 00:23:59,437
I'm getting way too old for this.

337
00:24:03,214 --> 00:24:05,384
Hi. I'm Rupert, Pleased to meet you.

338
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:06,560
Are you OK?

339
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:08,164
How about you?

340
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:09,374
He knew me.

341
00:24:09,967 --> 00:24:11,040
Whatever it was.

342
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,493
He knew my name.

343
00:24:28,727 --> 00:24:29,987
He knew my name.

344
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,839
He'd been sent to find me.

345
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:34,680
- What did I do?
- Nothing

346
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:36,862
It's what you might do
that worries them.

347
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:37,746
Oh!

348
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:38,924
Terrific.

349
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:42,680
And what about you? Did you just
happen along or did you follow me?

350
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,038
He wants to thank me.
He just can't find the words.

351
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:46,311
Were you following me?

352
00:24:46,394 --> 00:24:48,214
Protecting my assets
by saving your ass.

353
00:24:48,297 --> 00:24:50,024
Like I said, denial is not
an option.

354
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,640
- Excuse me
- Just a minute, Ruby.

355
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,327
- Do you know who sent them?
- Not exactly.

356
00:24:56,836 --> 00:24:58,330
The hoodies were Type Four.

357
00:24:58,522 --> 00:25:00,048
The big one a Type Five.

358
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,481
So you have to figure it wasn't
their idea.

359
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:04,730
- Why not?
- Type Fives don't have ideas.

360
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:07,614
And Type Fours can barely keep track
of their own saliva.

361
00:25:07,697 --> 00:25:10,680
But you're wanted by just about
every freak in the Half-Life, so...

362
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,932
Excuse me, wha -

363
00:25:12,015 --> 00:25:13,048
Who is she?

364
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:15,009
Who am I?

365
00:25:15,585 --> 00:25:16,520
Who is SHE?

366
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,040
Ruby's a friend of Luke's.

367
00:25:19,225 --> 00:25:20,026
Friend.

368
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,560
Is that entirely safe?

369
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,320
Where he goes...
I go.

370
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:24,583
Sweet.

371
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,554
So, Luke, you opened the Stacks.
Were you impressed?

372
00:25:28,802 --> 00:25:29,801
The point is...

373
00:25:29,884 --> 00:25:32,167
they're no to us. Luke and Ruby
were attacked.

374
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,511
And Ruby wants to know
what is going on?

375
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:37,289
So would someone please be kind
enough to explain?

376
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:38,210
Let's see.

377
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:39,955
Luke is the last Van Helsing.

378
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,471
The Inhuman want to kill him,
and you don't tell anybody.

379
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,258
Clear so far?

380
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,386
Luke is way under-prepared.

381
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,497
This is where you come in, Mina.

382
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:50,440
Go back with him to the Stacks.

383
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:52,372
Mina will find the weapons you need.

384
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,171
Excuse me. Another dumb question
I suppose, but...

385
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,460
how?

386
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,240
How will she?

387
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,632
Just leave it, Ruby.

388
00:26:00,715 --> 00:26:03,240
I mean, I'm not being funny,
but I wouldn't have thought

389
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,038
she was the obvious choice for
finding stuff, that's all.

390
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:08,600
Luke is not the the only one
with an illustrious family.

391
00:26:09,576 --> 00:26:10,713
Jonathan Harker...

392
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:14,200
Van Helsing's assistant, first
curator of the Stacks.

393
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:15,944
If it's in there, Mina will find it.

394
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:17,851
While you're gone, I'll do
some digging.

395
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,729
We need to find a name.

396
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:21,890
We have to know who we're up
against here.

397
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:23,581
Luke, don't go.

398
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,025
- Come on, Ruby, I have to.
- You so don't.

399
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,320
Luke, I have a really bad feeling
about this.

400
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,520
Don't go. Please.

401
00:26:43,998 --> 00:26:45,325
I'll call you. OK?

402
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,074
You got your car, Mina?

403
00:26:51,084 --> 00:26:53,520
- Of course.
- Oh(!) Is that entirely safe?

404
00:26:53,968 --> 00:26:55,103
And my driver.

405
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,041
And what am I supposed to do?

406
00:27:02,216 --> 00:27:04,929
Not a thing. You've had quite
a night. I'll take you home.

407
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:08,400
You don't need to patronise me,
you know. I'm not stupid.

408
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:11,614
Hmmm!

409
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,817
Halfway up at the back.

410
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,284
I can see it!

411
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:20,072
Careful. It's heavy.

412
00:27:34,189 --> 00:27:35,011
Well?

413
00:27:35,591 --> 00:27:36,651
Weird ammo.

414
00:27:37,052 --> 00:27:39,860
Glass. Two liquids.
One silver, one green.

415
00:27:39,943 --> 00:27:42,301
Not glass, actually. Soluble
plastic.

416
00:27:42,518 --> 00:27:44,278
On a human target, you'd get a bump.

417
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:46,664
- A bump.
- Knocked down but no tissue damage.

418
00:27:46,764 --> 00:27:49,461
No long-term effects. Fire at a
freak, and it's a different story.

419
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:51,532
They vaporise.

420
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,147
The original magic bullet.

421
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,854
Not magic, science.

422
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,160
And I'm supposed to use this?

423
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,957
I don't think so.

424
00:27:59,307 --> 00:28:02,337
Maybe you'll feel differently
when the time comes.

425
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,417
Is this it?

426
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:10,204
Sorry it's not up to Luke's
standards.

427
00:28:12,195 --> 00:28:13,505
Will you be OK?

428
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:14,865
Yeah.

429
00:28:14,948 --> 00:28:17,877
No self-respecting freak'd
be seen dead round here.

430
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:19,608
Wait.

431
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:24,240
Any time, day or night,
if anything happens...

432
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:25,989
you call me.

433
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:31,920
Give him time to adjust, Ruby.

434
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,800
It really has been quite a night.

435
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:39,134
Yeah.

436
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,936
You could say that.

437
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,443
Thanks for the lift, Rupert.

438
00:29:11,693 --> 00:29:12,561
Errrgh.

439
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:48,259
Ahhhh!

440
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:25,702
Thanks.

441
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,617
Rupert, it's Ruby.

442
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:31,120
You know what I said about freaks?

443
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:38,521
Boo.

444
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:47,153
Rupert, it's Ruby.

445
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,711
You know what I said about freaks?

446
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:01,460
Do you think I should call Ruby?

447
00:31:01,543 --> 00:31:03,630
Won't she be tucked up
in her little bed by now?

448
00:31:04,982 --> 00:31:07,039
You don't like her much, do you?

449
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,675
I don't know her.

450
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:12,349
Anyway, that's irrelevant,
She's your girlfriend.

451
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,527
No, she's not.

452
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,920
Ohhh, she thinks she is.

453
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,352
She wants to be.

454
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,114
Come on. You don't know that.

455
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,526
How do you know that?

456
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:28,636
Ohhh, it's this spooky sixth sense
that only blind people have.

457
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,373
Yeah, well, you're wrong.

458
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:32,751
We're just friends.
I've known her since she was four.

459
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:35,751
- We were at nursery, for God's sake.
- Whatever you say.

460
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:37,391
It's not my business.

461
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:41,069
But... your life is changing.

462
00:31:41,795 --> 00:31:44,099
Do you really want
to get her involved?

463
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:45,426
She's not involved.

464
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,937
We were attacked.

465
00:31:47,095 --> 00:31:48,155
It happened.

466
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:52,224
And it won't happen again.

467
00:31:53,939 --> 00:31:56,862
- Look, it's late. I should go.
- Don't forget this.

468
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,516
I'm not good with stuff like this.

469
00:31:59,883 --> 00:32:01,480
I'd probably'bump'my foot off.

470
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:03,651
You'll be just fine.

471
00:32:16,163 --> 00:32:17,615
Hi, love. Good time?

472
00:32:18,132 --> 00:32:20,106
- It was different.
- Different's good.

473
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,084
Come and tell me all about it.

474
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,604
Mina, Rupert.

475
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:36,307
Yeah. Luke's friend, Ruby...

476
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:39,398
She never made it home.

477
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,480
I know it's my fault. Whatever,
just meet me at the Stacks now.

478
00:32:45,818 --> 00:32:47,179
So, you liked him?

479
00:32:47,321 --> 00:32:48,347
Got on OK?

480
00:32:49,107 --> 00:32:50,684
Sure. He's, um...

481
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:51,957
interesting.

482
00:32:52,466 --> 00:32:53,784
Had an interesting life.

483
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:56,004
Loads of colourful stories, I bet.

484
00:32:56,193 --> 00:32:58,187
Oh, yes. He tells a good story.

485
00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:00,336
Well, they were young.

486
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:01,955
Travelling the world.

487
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,080
It was great for them really.

488
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:06,425
Then it was all over.

489
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:07,914
Yes.

490
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,172
Then it was all over.

491
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:13,600
Did Rupert... talk about it?

492
00:33:14,684 --> 00:33:15,551
Not really.

493
00:33:16,436 --> 00:33:18,798
He mentioned the trip,
when Dad died.

494
00:33:19,904 --> 00:33:21,607
I didn't realise he was there.

495
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,660
Oh, yes. Rupert was there.

496
00:33:25,395 --> 00:33:26,781
He was great then.

497
00:33:28,116 --> 00:33:29,502
Brilliant, really.

498
00:33:29,994 --> 00:33:31,596
Dealt with everything.

499
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,832
Then he disappeared?

500
00:33:35,784 --> 00:33:36,601
Yes.

501
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,622
Well...

502
00:33:38,854 --> 00:33:41,775
We all have our own ways
of dealing with things.

503
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:45,920
I won't disappear.

504
00:33:47,761 --> 00:33:48,604
I know.

505
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:52,220
We're a team, right?

506
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,557
- I'm going to go to bed.
- You go. I'll do this.

507
00:33:57,645 --> 00:33:59,951
Not too long. You've got that test
tomorrow, remember.

508
00:34:10,638 --> 00:34:11,443
Ruby?

509
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:13,696
What's the matter?

510
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:15,832
I don't know what he wants.
He won't tell me.

511
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:17,639
Who? Ruby, where are you?

512
00:34:18,912 --> 00:34:20,105
Baltic Stairs.

513
00:34:21,298 --> 00:34:22,421
You got that?

514
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:23,693
Baltic Stairs.

515
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:25,328
Let me speak to her.

516
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:26,950
I want to know she's all right.

517
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:30,033
She won't be. Unless you come
on your own.

518
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,745
I want to talk to her!

519
00:34:31,828 --> 00:34:34,057
And that means without... Galvin.

520
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,171
Ruby!

521
00:34:37,707 --> 00:34:39,075
# Ruby, Ruby, Ruby

522
00:34:45,498 --> 00:34:48,001
- What?
- On his way. Guvnor.

523
00:34:52,952 --> 00:34:54,788
# Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby #

524
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:09,400
Do you know who I am?

525
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:11,422
(GROWLING)

526
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:17,320
Do you have... any idea
what has befallen you?

527
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:21,466
You have entered a world of sorrow.

528
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:23,811
Dark streets,

529
00:35:24,262 --> 00:35:26,181
rain falling on cobbles.

530
00:35:26,927 --> 00:35:27,820
All...

531
00:35:27,903 --> 00:35:28,888
Comfort...

532
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:29,843
Fled.

533
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,610
The thin taste of anguish
and despair.

534
00:35:37,195 --> 00:35:39,031
In short, girly...

535
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:41,802
you have entered my world.

536
00:35:42,678 --> 00:35:44,294
Gladiolus Thrip...

537
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:45,896
at your service.

538
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,132
Are you getting anything?

539
00:35:56,012 --> 00:35:57,797
Don't you just hate that?

540
00:35:57,914 --> 00:36:00,360
How can you respect an individual
who doesn't use the john,

541
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:02,280
just hawks it all up?

542
00:36:19,531 --> 00:36:21,133
It's an old building.

543
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:24,309
Somewhere near water,
down by the river, I think.

544
00:36:25,506 --> 00:36:27,276
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

545
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,965
Another face, a shadow,
right near the end.

546
00:36:31,669 --> 00:36:33,000
I think I know who it is.

547
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:34,940
His name's Thrip.

548
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:36,766
- Hmmm.
- You know him?

549
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:38,600
Yeah. Type 12, bounty hunter.

550
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:41,538
Do you think you can locate him?

551
00:36:41,621 --> 00:36:42,496
I think so.

552
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:44,253
Thrip is nasty but he's not stupid.

553
00:36:44,712 --> 00:36:46,840
Ruby will be OK until he gets
his hands on Luke.

554
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:48,602
Luke is safe home, right?

555
00:36:48,935 --> 00:36:49,928
Of course.

556
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:51,522
Don't worry.

557
00:37:46,452 --> 00:37:47,804
You're safe. I've got you.

558
00:37:50,984 --> 00:37:52,800
I'm sorry, dear boy, forgive me.

559
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:54,160
But your face.

560
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,582
It's a picture.

561
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,120
Gladiolus Thrip, at your service.

562
00:37:58,664 --> 00:37:59,615
Where's Ruby?

563
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:03,332
- What have you done with her?
- Oh, quite safe. Quite safe.

564
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,800
Just had to make sure you'd do
as you were told.

565
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,516
The smiter smit, eh, Mr Redlip?

566
00:38:11,577 --> 00:38:12,378
Well?

567
00:38:13,146 --> 00:38:14,257
Is he on his own?

568
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,670
There's a thing.

569
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,555
Good boy.

570
00:38:19,326 --> 00:38:21,538
You said if I came on my own,
you wouldn't hurt her.

571
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:25,543
No, I think we said if you didn't
come on your own, we would hurt her!

572
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:28,200
Subtle distinction, but I'm a bit
of a stickler.

573
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:31,065
Where is she?

574
00:38:31,716 --> 00:38:33,777
You want to know where she is?

575
00:38:34,373 --> 00:38:36,440
Hold out your hands
and I'll show you.

576
00:38:37,934 --> 00:38:39,000
Come along.

577
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,747
My word is my bond.

578
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:43,342
We're only going to cuff you.

579
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:51,519
Cuff him, Mr Redlip.

580
00:38:59,846 --> 00:39:02,392
Like taking sweetbreads from a baby.

581
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,788
She's right... beneath you.

582
00:39:28,788 --> 00:39:32,040
Put the gun down or forever
know my wrath, you freak.

583
00:39:46,222 --> 00:39:47,131
Whoopee.

584
00:39:47,574 --> 00:39:49,376
Well done, Mr Galvin.

585
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,080
That's more like it.

586
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:53,920
Forever know my wrath, eh?
Marvellous.

587
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,320
Oh, shut up, Gladys, you cancerous
piece of garbage.

588
00:39:56,766 --> 00:39:58,744
Sticks and stones, Mr Galvin.

589
00:39:58,911 --> 00:40:00,560
Sticks and stones.

590
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,689
So have we come to negotiate?
Is that the style of the thing?

591
00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:07,520
Oh, I don't negotiate with freaks.
I just grade 'em and I smite 'em.

592
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,005
And very well you do it,
if I might say.

593
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:12,053
Mind you... that said,

594
00:40:12,304 --> 00:40:14,498
we all have a trick or two
up our sleeves.

595
00:40:18,187 --> 00:40:18,988
Ohhh.

596
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:19,920
Scary.

597
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:21,589
My turn.

598
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:36,034
Where's Ruby?

599
00:40:36,117 --> 00:40:38,633
Thrip said she was down there
under the grate. Come on!

600
00:40:38,716 --> 00:40:39,520
Come on.

601
00:40:49,723 --> 00:40:50,641
Come on.

602
00:41:04,043 --> 00:41:04,919
Let her go.

603
00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:07,723
Of course. It's you I want.

604
00:41:08,018 --> 00:41:09,760
Put - the - gun - down!

605
00:41:10,722 --> 00:41:11,807
I don't trust you.

606
00:41:12,475 --> 00:41:13,276
Trust?

607
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:16,234
This isn't about trust, matey.

608
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:19,747
It's about me stabbing her in the
neck if you don't do as I tell you.

609
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,760
Shoot, Luke. She'll be OK.

610
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,195
What?

611
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,550
Shoot her,

612
00:41:25,393 --> 00:41:26,544
and then shoot him.

613
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,480
You must believe, Luke.

614
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,920
Even when it seems impossible.

615
00:41:44,863 --> 00:41:46,440
Bring it on, laddie.

616
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
If you think
you've got the oomph, that it.

617
00:41:53,148 --> 00:41:54,041
Oh dear.

618
00:41:54,575 --> 00:41:56,440
Smiters aren't what they were.

619
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:24,580
Ruby.

620
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,320
Get off! You shocked me.

621
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:31,940
She's fine.

622
00:42:32,365 --> 00:42:33,359
She's OK.

623
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,520
Thanks, Mina.
- No problem.

624
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,880
You shocked me with
a sodding raygun!

625
00:42:56,216 --> 00:42:58,557
- You did well last night.
- You think so?

626
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,750
Yes, I do.

627
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:01,016
How's Ruby?

628
00:43:01,467 --> 00:43:03,553
She yelled all
the way home because I shot her,

629
00:43:03,636 --> 00:43:05,511
And make me buy a pizza
for the breakfast.

630
00:43:05,594 --> 00:43:06,925
You know what i'm saying?

631
00:43:07,192 --> 00:43:08,120
Very good.

632
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,612
Here, I....

633
00:43:11,015 --> 00:43:12,640
I have something yours.

634
00:43:14,336 --> 00:43:15,980
Where did you get this?

635
00:43:16,356 --> 00:43:17,265

Professor Rubert E. Galvin

642
00:43:32,063 --> 00:43:33,281
What "e" stands for?

643
00:43:34,391 --> 00:43:35,233
Expensive.

644
00:43:40,976 --> 00:43:43,560

Oh, and... Rubbish Smiler.

777. You dream very well note.

00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,200
Mr. Rutherford.

650
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:21,960
Did you actually do any
revisions for your test?

651
00:44:23,165 --> 00:44:23,979
Yeah

652
00:44:24,384 --> 00:44:27,040
- Some.
- Congratulatons, you hid it well.

653
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,093
- Have you considered extra tuitions?
- No,

654
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:35,224
- I haven't thought...
- Well you should.

655
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:36,200
Sorry.

656
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,080
Hello? I have to take this.
