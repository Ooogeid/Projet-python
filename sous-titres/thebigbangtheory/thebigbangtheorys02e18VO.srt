1
00:00:00,481 --> 00:00:03,023
Knight to queen's bishop-five.

2
00:00:04,387 --> 00:00:06,487
Very nice.
What's Leonard going to do?

3
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:08,842
Give up the pawn
or give up the position?

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,160
Let's find out.

5
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:12,053
Ready?

6
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:13,702
Ready.

7
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:15,455
Go.

8
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:41,083
Damn it. I slipped.

9
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:45,008
Too bad. You know the rules
of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess.

10
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:48,279
Leonard died again,
Sheldon. You're up.

11
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,295
Despite my deep love of chess,
lasers and aerosol disinfectant,

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,469
I must forfeit.

13
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:56,471
- Why?
- Because it's almost 11:00.

14
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:57,801
So?

15
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:00,264
Penny has a "don't knock
on my door before 11:00

16
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:02,603
or I punch you in the throat" rule.

17
00:01:07,148 --> 00:01:08,774
You know what'd be a great idea?

18
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:12,885
We get some girls over here
and play Laser Optical Strip Chess.

19
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:16,585
Believe me, any girl
who would be willing to play that,

20
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,610
you don't want to see naked.

21
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:22,075
You underestimate me.

22
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:34,731
Hey, Sheldon.

23
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:39,254
- It's 11:00 a.m.
- I know. You're safe.

24
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:42,142
This package came
while you were at work.

25
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:43,977
Great, my rhinestones.
Thank you.

26
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,342
- Excuse me.
- What?

27
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:47,067
You have to sign this.

28
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:50,083
- What is it?
- When I signed for the package,

29
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,643
I was deputized
by the United Parcel Service

30
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:55,531
and entrusted with its final delivery.
I now need you to acknowledge

31
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:59,612
receipt of the package so that I'm
fully indemnified and no longer liable.

32
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,393
It's just a box of rhinestones.

33
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,526
The contents are irrelevant.
A legal bailment has been created.

34
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:07,293
Does that mean nothing to you?

35
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:09,962
It means nothing to anybody.

36
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:14,884
- Let me show you what I'm doing.
- "Bailment" describes a relationship

37
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,072
in common law where a physical
possession of personal property,

38
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:20,964
or "chattels," is transferred
from one person, the bailor,

39
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:22,683
to another person, the bailee...

40
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:25,102
Look, look!
I started a business.

41
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,959
Obviously, not a cleaning business.

42
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,144
No, I'm making flower barrettes.
See?

43
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:34,776
I call them Penny Blossoms.

44
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:37,280
I made one for myself,
then all the girls at work wanted one.

45
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,575
I showed some to this lady
who runs a shop in Old Town.

46
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,473
She sells cards and homemade jewelry.
She said she wanted to sell them.

47
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:45,350
I said, "Okay."
And in one week, I made a $156.

48
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:47,585
Good for you. Sign here.

49
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:54,301
Don't you get it? If this takes off,
I won't have to be a waitress anymore.

50
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:57,927
But then who will bring me
my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?

51
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,040
- Another waitress.
- What's her name?

52
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:02,598
I don't know.

53
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,767
And you're going to let her
handle my food?

54
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,756
Nancy. Her name is Nancy.

55
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:09,854
I think you're just making that up.

56
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:11,655
I'm sorry about your hamburger.

57
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,276
I just don't want to be a waitress
for the rest of my life.

58
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,320
Cheeseburger.
I get a cheeseburger.

59
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:20,085
- Fine, cheeseburger.
- Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy.

60
00:03:20,963 --> 00:03:24,036
So, what do you think?
I mean, this could be a business, right?

61
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:27,403
How many of these
can you make a day?

62
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:28,624
About 20.

63
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:32,099
And how much profit do you make per...
Penny Blossom?

64
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,630
Like, 50 cents. I'm not sure.

65
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,048
Of course you're not.
All right...

66
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:40,135
Ten dollars a day
times five days a week

67
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,231
times 52 weeks a year is $2,600.

68
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:46,177
- That's all?
- Before taxes.

69
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:49,270
I don't have to pay taxes
on this stuff.

70
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,189
I believe the Internal Revenue Service
would strongly disagree.

71
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,776
But, if you took advantage
of modern marketing techniques,

72
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,080
and you optimized
your manufacturing process,

73
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,156
you might be able to make
this a viable business.

74
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,075
And you know about that stuff?

75
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:11,139
I'm a physicist.
I have a working knowledge

76
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:14,523
of the entire universe
and everything it contains.

77
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:18,799
Who's Radiohead?

78
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:35,381
I have a working knowledge
of the important things in the universe.

79
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:37,867
- Good luck.
- Sheldon, hold on.

80
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,114
Could you maybe show me how
to make more money with this?

81
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:44,434
Of course I could.

82
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:46,404
Wait!

83
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:48,370
Will you?

84
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,193
Just to be clear here,

85
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:56,545
you're asking for my assistance.

86
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:01,674
And you understand that will involve
me telling you what to do?

87
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,244
I understand.

88
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,974
And you're not allowed to be sarcastic
or snide to me while I'm doing so.

89
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,070
Good.

90
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:16,621
Let's begin with the premise

91
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:19,941
that everything you've done
up to this point is wrong.

92
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:23,572
- Oh, imagine that.
- Sarcasm. Good-bye.

93
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,741
No, sorry. Wait!
Please come back!

94
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,969
Subtitles: The FW Team

95
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:54,728
- There. Done.
- All right.

96
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:57,398
12 minutes and 17 seconds.

97
00:05:57,762 --> 00:06:00,845
- Pretty good, right?
- That's 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour.

98
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,948
Based on your cost of materials
and your wholesale selling price,

99
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:07,778
you'll effectively be paying yourself...
$5.19 a day.

100
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:10,411
"A day"?

101
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,580
There are children in a sneaker factory
in Indonesia who outearn you.

102
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:17,376
That just can't be right.

103
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:20,087
- You're questioning my math?
- No, sorry.

104
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:22,548
- Want me to show my work?
- God, no.

105
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,893
Please tell me what to do about it.

106
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,499
All right. Are you familiar
with the development

107
00:06:27,624 --> 00:06:31,618
that resulted from Honoré Blanc's
1778 use of interchangeable parts?

108
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:38,468
The assembly line, of course.

109
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:42,651
If I'm not allowed to be snide,
you're not allowed to be condescending.

110
00:06:42,957 --> 00:06:46,196
That wasn't a part of our original
agreement, and I don't agree to it now.

111
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:47,835
Fine.

112
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,201
How are we supposed to set up machines
and conveyor belts in my apartment?

113
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,159
You're thinking of the moving
assembly line,

114
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:55,998
an understandable
but not excusable mistake.

115
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,957
The moving assembly line, that
was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908.

116
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:04,436
That innovation is what made possible
our modern consumer culture

117
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:07,272
by enabling a low-unit cost
for manufactured goods.

118
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:11,197
I guess that isn't one of the topics
discussed on your Radiohead.

119
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,233
Let's go. We're going to miss
the coming attractions.

120
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:19,802
What's the matter?

121
00:07:23,897 --> 00:07:27,147
I think I bruised a testicle
capturing that last pawn.

122
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:33,827
<i>Please pay attention
and listen to me</i>

123
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:37,498
<i>Give me some time
to blow the man down</i>

124
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:40,542
<i>I'm a deepwater sailor
just come from Hong Kong</i>

125
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:43,652
<i>To me way, hey,
blow the man down</i>

126
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:46,838
<i>If you give me some whiskey
I'll sing you a song</i>

127
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,676
<i>Give me some time
to blow the man down.</i>

128
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:50,844
Hello?

129
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:53,598
Hello.

130
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,558
<i>Come quickly lay aft
To the break of the poop</i>

131
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:59,918
<i>To me way, hey,
blow the man down</i>

132
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:02,731
<i>Or I'll help you along
with the toe of my boot</i>

133
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:06,159
<i>Give me some time
to blow the man down.</i>

134
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:07,402
What's going on?

135
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:10,101
I assume you're referring
to the sea shanty.

136
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:13,098
It's a rhythmic work song
designed to increase productivity.

137
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:14,833
It's crazy, but it totally works.

138
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,621
We made this Penny Blossom
in under three minutes.

139
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:21,899
Terrific, but that kind of raises
more questions than it answers.

140
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:24,618
Penny's making hair accessories.

141
00:08:24,743 --> 00:08:27,036
I'm helping her optimize
her manufacturing process.

142
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:28,197
Break's over.

143
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:30,979
<i>Pay attention to orders
now you one and all...</i>

144
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:33,220
Hold on. What are you
using as a bonding agent?

145
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:35,134
- Hot glue.
- You're kidding.

146
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:37,599
Any of the cyanoacrylates
would do a better job.

147
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,143
The flower's too porous.

148
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:41,631
What if we infused the bottom layer

149
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:44,064
with silicone-RTV to provide
a better mounting surface?

150
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,591
Intriguing.

151
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:49,068
What are your marketing
and distribution channels?

152
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:52,587
There are the waitresses at my work,
and this cute, little shop in Old Town.

153
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:54,362
Virtually non-existent.

154
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:59,231
I'm thinking that we set her up with
a hosted e-commerce system to start.

155
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,914
Why not eliminate the middle man?

156
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,168
We could install a small server farm
with a static IP in her bedroom.

157
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:05,919
With an industrial cooling system.

158
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,231
Of course, but before we set up
marketing and distribution,

159
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:11,799
we should finish optimizing
the manufacturing process.

160
00:09:11,924 --> 00:09:14,211
To start with,
she has a terrible problem

161
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,636
with moisture-induced glitter clump.

162
00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:19,349
Yeah, it's a bitch.

163
00:09:22,237 --> 00:09:23,986
I've seen this before.

164
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:27,821
- Where?
- It's a common stripper problem.

165
00:09:30,672 --> 00:09:32,922
They dance, they sweat, they clump.

166
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,120
Are you thinking about adding
a desiccant like calcium sulfate?

167
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:44,124
Actually, I'm thinking
about this one stripper named Vega.

168
00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:49,574
But sure, calcium sulfate
could work.

169
00:09:50,493 --> 00:09:53,043
Let's think
out of the box for a moment.

170
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:54,968
How about a molecular sieve?

171
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,706
I've got a spaghetti strainer
in the kitchen.

172
00:10:08,177 --> 00:10:10,984
We could liberate some micro-porous
charcoal from the chem lab.

173
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:12,299
Great.

174
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:14,651
Raj, why don't you and Howard,
go get the charcoal?

175
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:17,552
Leonard, why don't you start working
on some preliminary Web site designs.

176
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:19,159
I'll make some space

177
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,662
in our apartment so we can move
the manufacturing process.

178
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,544
What's wrong with my apartment?

179
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:25,249
It's not my apartment.

180
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:27,251
Wait, what am I going to do?

181
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,003
It's your business.
Do whatever you want.

182
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:33,587
Okay, cool.

183
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,753
I'm going to take a nap.

184
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:43,536
I'm still tweaking things
a little bit,

185
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:46,321
but this will give you
the general idea of the Web site.

186
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:53,007
So, what do you guys think?

187
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:58,473
Pretty much any way I say that
is going to hurt his feelings.

188
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,413
- Okay, what's wrong with it?
- What's wrong with it?

189
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,290
Not you. I wasn't asking you.

190
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:11,369
Well, it's a little juvenile.

191
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,132
It kind of looks like the MySpace page
of a 13-year-old girl.

192
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:17,363
No, it doesn't.

193
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,274
Please. <i>Dateline</i> could use it
to attract predators.

194
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:28,413
This is your enterprise,
so it's ultimately your decision,

195
00:11:28,538 --> 00:11:30,278
but based on the quality
of his work,

196
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:33,123
I'd strongly recommend
that we let Leonard go.

197
00:11:34,057 --> 00:11:35,277
You want to fire me?

198
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,504
What I want is irrelevant.
This is Penny's decision.

199
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:44,411
Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job
then why do we already have orders?

200
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,623
We do?

201
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:46,808
Look.

202
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,468
Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville,
Alabama has ordered two.

203
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,284
No kidding. Two?

204
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:55,464
Look at the comments.

205
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,472
"Thank you, Penny Blossoms.

206
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:59,634
"These will be perfect
to cover my bald spot."

207
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:04,357
That is so sweet.

208
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:06,000
Camouflaging bald spots.

209
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,950
That's primarily a male concern.

210
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:10,289
Perhaps we could expand our market.

211
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:13,774
How are flower barrettes
going to appeal to men?

212
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:18,879
We add Bluetooth!

213
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:22,824
Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.

214
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:26,474
Wait a minute, you want to make
a hair barrette with Bluetooth?

215
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:29,956
Everything is better with Bluetooth.

216
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,756
Holy crap. Someone just ordered
a thousand Penny Blossoms.

217
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:38,936
Get out!

218
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:41,503
Who needs a thousand
sparkly flower barrettes

219
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:42,803
with rhinestones?

220
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:45,794
"The Fifth Annual East
Rutherford, New Jersey,

221
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,002
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual
and Transgender Alliance Luau."

222
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:53,578
Another market to expand into...
balding gay men.

223
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:57,267
And I'll bet lesbians
love Bluetooth.

224
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,001
We should get to work.

225
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:02,030
Wait, why does it say
"one-day rush"?

226
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:04,282
Since when do we offer
a one-day rush?

227
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:06,414
Amazon offers one-day rush.

228
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:09,371
Yeah, but they don't have
to glue the books together.

229
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:13,504
How the hell are we going to make
a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?

230
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:16,994
Don't yell at me. I'm not manufacturing.
I'm just Web design.

231
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,548
I'm gonna have to call them
and cancel the order.

232
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:20,757
Excuse me,

233
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:22,879
but was this not your goal?

234
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:24,232
Financial independence

235
00:13:24,357 --> 00:13:26,659
through entrepreneurial
brilliance and innovation?

236
00:13:26,784 --> 00:13:29,838
My brilliance and innovation,
of course, but still.

237
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:33,329
I just don't see
how we can pull this off.

238
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:36,677
That, right there,
that equivocation and self-doubt,

239
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,899
that is not the American spirit.

240
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,192
Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo?
Did Jim Bowie?

241
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:46,223
They didn't quit.
They were massacred...

242
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,868
by like a gazillion angry Mexicans.

243
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:54,882
Let me put it this way.

244
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:57,132
Your gross receipts
on this one order

245
00:13:57,257 --> 00:13:59,963
will be over $3,000
for one night's work.

246
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:03,020
You guys get started.

247
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:07,112
- What are you doing?
- Going online to buy shoes!

248
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:12,637
<i>She'll be coming round the mountain
when she comes</i>

249
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:16,062
<i>She'll be coming round the mountain
when she comes</i>

250
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:18,693
<i>She'll be coming round the mountain</i>

251
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:22,918
You know, if I wanted to spend
my Saturday nights doing this,

252
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:24,836
I could have stayed in India.

253
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,633
Stop with the fake third world crap.

254
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:32,787
Your father's a gynecologist.
And you had a house full of servants.

255
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:34,787
We only had four servants.

256
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:36,500
And two of them were children.

257
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:40,670
How we doing?

258
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,590
We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms
ready to ship.

259
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:45,759
We're never gonna finish in time.

260
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:49,012
Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?

261
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,347
I believe I'm hearing some negativity
on the factory floor.

262
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:56,443
- So?
- Penny.

263
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:59,883
The labor force is a living organism
that must be carefully nurtured.

264
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:02,384
Any counterproductive grumbling
must be skillfully

265
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:04,424
headed off by management.
Observe.

266
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,790
Less talk, more work!

267
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:13,033
- Nicely done.
- Thank you.

268
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:15,585
You hear any union talk,
you let me know.

269
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:21,359
<i>Someone's in the kitchen
with Dinah...</i>

270
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:28,183
<i>Someone's in the kitchen
I know-ow-ow-ow</i>

271
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,620
<i>Someone's in the kitchen
with Dinah...</i>

272
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:38,726
<i>'Cause I sold my soul
to the company store</i>

273
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:45,449
- Honey, do you want some coffee?
- I don't drink coffee.

274
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:48,196
But if you don't stay awake
we'll never finish in time.

275
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,016
Sorry, coffee's out of the question.
When I moved to California,

276
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:53,702
I promised my mother
that I wouldn't start doing drugs.

277
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:55,370
Leonard, help.

278
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,372
Sheldon, we still have 380
of these things to make.

279
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,515
I have complete faith
that you will make them.

280
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,640
Good night.

281
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:05,514
But, Sheldon,
without your insight and leadership,

282
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,289
this entire enterprise
will surely fail.

283
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:13,206
You're right, of course.

284
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,065
Here, this will help.

285
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:19,141
Very well,

286
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,643
but if this leads to opiates
or hallucinogenics,

287
00:16:22,768 --> 00:16:25,264
you're going to have
to answer to my mother.

288
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:29,205
Look at Planck's Constant.

289
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,454
People say it's arbitrary.
It could not be less arbitrary.

290
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,643
If it varied slightly,
life as we know it would not exist.

291
00:16:35,986 --> 00:16:36,986
Bam!

292
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,014
Now, now, let's reconsider
the entire argument,

293
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,627
but with entropy reversed

294
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:46,338
and effect preceding cause.

295
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:50,091
So you are thinking of a universe
that's not expanding from the center.

296
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,383
No, it is retreating from a...
from a possibility space.

297
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,643
This is a space
where we are all essentially

298
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,768
Alice through the looking glass,
standing in front of the Red Queen,

299
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:05,834
and we're being offered
a cracker to quench our thirst.

300
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,133
Of course, in another universe,
let's call it universe prime...

301
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:14,666
We should have let him go to bed.

302
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:21,808
I can't believe we actually did it.

303
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:26,262
1,000 friggin' Penny Blossoms.

304
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,612
I just want you guys to know
I am really grateful for your help.

305
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:34,052
And for ever dollar I make,
I'm going to give you 20 cents.

306
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,805
That's your entire profit margin.

307
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,634
Then never mind.

308
00:17:41,274 --> 00:17:43,362
I'll print out the shipping label.

309
00:17:48,054 --> 00:17:49,054
What?

310
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:51,639
We got an e-mail
from the East Rutherford, New Jersey,

311
00:17:51,764 --> 00:17:54,848
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual
and Transgender Alliance.

312
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,864
They want
another thousand Penny Blossoms.

313
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:00,448
Really?

314
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,067
One-day rush.

315
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,183
I really need
to take that off the Web site.

316
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,380
Guess we'd better get started.

317
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:12,298
You can't be serious.

318
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:14,388
Come on.

319
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:17,178
What about the living organism
of the workforce

320
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,316
and the American spirit?!

321
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:22,018
And Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?!

322
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:27,077
Davy Crockett.
Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.

323
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:30,942
Yes, I know that, okay? I'm tired.
I've had like 18 cups of coffee.

324
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,213
The point is,
if we just pull together...

325
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:35,739
We can do this.
Who's with me?

326
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:42,892
Although you may
find it hard to believe,

327
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:44,442
we do have lives.

328
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,531
Sorry.

329
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:58,678
My apologies to the gay community
of East Rutherford, New Jersey.

330
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,845
Where's the coffee?!

331
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:13,735
We're all out.

332
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:17,271
No problem.

333
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:21,075
I'll be back
before this banana hits the ground.

334
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,300
Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent
Laser Obstacle Lunch is just stupid.
