1
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:08,586
I always tear up when
the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.

2
00:00:09,126 --> 00:00:10,301
Tears seem appropriate.

3
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:12,186
Enlargement of the heart muscle,

4
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:14,408
or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
is a serious disease

5
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:16,432
which could lead to congestive
heart failure.

6
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:22,980
You really didn't like it?

7
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:24,373
No, on the contrary.

8
00:00:24,498 --> 00:00:27,060
I found the Grinch
to be a relatable,

9
00:00:27,185 --> 00:00:28,622
engaging character.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,468
And I was really
with him right up to the point

11
00:00:31,593 --> 00:00:33,212
that he succumbed
to social convention

12
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:35,709
and returned the presents
and saved Christmas.

13
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:38,669
What a buzz kill that was.

14
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,334
When we watch <i>Frosty the Snowman,</i>
he roots for the sun.

15
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:45,435
Excuse me,

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,755
but the sun is essential
for all life on Earth.

17
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,122
Frosty is merely

18
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,343
a bit of frozen supernatural
ephemera in a stolen hat.

19
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,638
A crime, by the way, for which
he is never brought to account.

20
00:01:00,783 --> 00:01:03,186
Episode 311: The Maternal Congruence

21
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,220
Sync: Jess, Linwelin, Loky

22
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,199
www.subbercafe.fr

23
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:32,569
I just love decorating
the Christmas tree.

24
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:34,680
It makes me feel like
a little girl again.

25
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:36,637
We didn't have a tree
when I was growing up.

26
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,101
Really? Why not?

27
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:39,916
In my family,

28
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:42,291
holidays weren't so much
celebrated as studied

29
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,854
for their anthropological and
psychological implications

30
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,147
on human society.

31
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:48,246
Oh, sounds festive.

32
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:49,775
Did you at least give presents?

33
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:51,604
In a way.

34
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,076
We presented papers.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,284
And then broke off into focus groups
and critiqued each other.

36
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:01,976
Sheldon, what about you?
Did you have a Christmas tree?

37
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,790
We had a tree, we had a manger,

38
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:08,353
we had an inflatable Santa Claus

39
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:10,838
with plastic reindeer
on the front lawn.

40
00:02:11,677 --> 00:02:13,077
And to make things more jolly,

41
00:02:13,202 --> 00:02:14,854
there were so many lights
on the house

42
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:17,470
they induced
neighborhood-wide seizures.

43
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:20,347
So I take it you don't want
to help us trim the tree.

44
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,538
I do not.

45
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:22,916
But if you insist

46
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:26,384
on decorating a spider-infested
fire hazard in my home

47
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:29,377
I would request that you add this.

48
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:30,357
What is it?

49
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:32,913
You're kidding, right?

50
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:35,946
It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.

51
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:39,491
Oh, sure, sure.
Very Christmasy.

52
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:41,451
Wait, excuse me, but it's much

53
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,995
more "Christmasy"
than anything you've put on the tree.

54
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:45,413
Here we go.

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,540
December 25, 1642,

56
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:51,085
Julian calendar,
Sir Isaac Newton is born.

57
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:53,172
Jesus, on the other hand,
was actually born

58
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,102
in the summer...
His birthday was moved

59
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:57,350
to coincide with a traditional
pagan holiday

60
00:02:57,475 --> 00:03:00,721
that celebrated the winter solstice
with lit fires and slaughtered goats.

61
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,913
Which, frankly, sounds like more fun
than 12 hours of church with my mother

62
00:03:05,038 --> 00:03:06,268
followed by a fruitcake.

63
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:09,552
Merry Newton-mas, everyone.

64
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:13,279
I sense that's not sincere,
although I have no idea why.

65
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:17,196
No, it's fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go
right next to this little candy cane.

66
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,765
No. Isaac goes at the top
of the tree.

67
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:21,784
No, he doesn't.

68
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,163
I understand.

69
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,913
You dispute Newton's claim
that he invented calculus

70
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,696
and you want to put Gottfried
Leibniz on the top.

71
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:31,544
Yeah, you got me.
I'm a Leibniz man.

72
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:34,922
Perhaps when your mother gets here,
she'll talk some sense into you.

73
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:37,716
What?
Your-your mother's coming? When?

74
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:39,036
Tomorrow.

75
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,908
When were you going to tell me?

76
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:42,637
Tomorrow?

77
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:45,265
Why were you keeping this a secret?

78
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:48,186
- Well, I just... I thought...
- If I can interject here,

79
00:03:48,538 --> 00:03:50,178
obviously Leonard is concerned

80
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:52,523
that his mother won't approve
of you as his mate.

81
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:57,027
Why wouldn't she approve of me?
I'm adorable.

82
00:03:57,975 --> 00:04:00,516
- You are, it's just...
- If I can interject again.

83
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,933
Leonard comes from
a remarkably high-achieving family,

84
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:07,036
who have all chosen
high-achieving partners.

85
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:08,663
He probably feels

86
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,474
that it's doubtful that his
mother will be overly impressed

87
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,285
with his dating a woman whose
most significant achievement

88
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,718
is memorizing
the Cheesecake Factory menu.

89
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,383
Hey, it's a big menu.

90
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,052
There's two pages just for desserts.

91
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:26,055
I know. And those specials...
they change every day.

92
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,411
You know what?
It's lame when I say it.

93
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:30,518
It's just ridiculous
when you pile on.

94
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,854
Sorry.

95
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,436
What did she say
when you told her we were going out?

96
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,444
You didn't tell her
we were going out?

97
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,072
Why not?

98
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,914
I'm no expert on meditation,
but if y're trying

99
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:49,371
to calm yourself down,
I believe the word is "Om."

100
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:56,128
It was so nice of you to come all the
way down to the airport to pick me up.

101
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:57,546
No trouble at all.

102
00:04:58,004 --> 00:04:59,298
I drove, Mother.

103
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,650
I'm driving now.

104
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,261
Yes, dear. Mommy's proud.

105
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:08,327
I've been meaning to thank you
for your notes on my paper

106
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:10,226
disproving quantum
brain dynamic theory.

107
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,226
My pleasure.

108
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:12,811
For a non-physicist,

109
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,454
you have a remarkable grasp

110
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:17,200
of how electric dipoles
in the brain's water molecules

111
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:19,944
could not possibly form
a Bose condensate.

112
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:21,403
Wait, wait.

113
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:24,323
When did you send my mom
notes on a paper?

114
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,691
August 16.

115
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:28,327
Right after
her carpal tunnel surgery.

116
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,809
- Did I thank you for the flowers?
- You did.

117
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:33,123
I don't like flowers.

118
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:35,100
Neither do I, but it's
the social convention.

119
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,503
It is, isn't it?

120
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:39,254
Wait, wait, wait.
You had surgery?

121
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,038
Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.

122
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:42,415
No, I heard that.

123
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,735
Then what was all that
"wait, wait, wait" about?

124
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:49,598
I just don't understand why he knows
more about your life than I do.

125
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,122
I would assume it's because
Sheldon and I stay in touch

126
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:54,021
due to mutual interest and respect,

127
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,956
while you avoid me,
due to unresolved childhood issues.

128
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:01,443
It's what we think caused
your narcissistic personality disorder.

129
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,689
We discussed it at length
during our last video chat.

130
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:08,994
Although how we got
onto the subject of you is baffling.

131
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,738
But we are on the subject,
so I'm obliged to ask.

132
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:14,413
Leonard, how are you?

133
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:17,459
Fine, Mom. How are you?

134
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:18,836
Menopausal.

135
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:21,506
Now I'm less fine.

136
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,179
Have you heard
your brother has gotten engaged?

137
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:28,283
Sheldon, why didn't you tell me?

138
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:29,408
My bad.

139
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,991
I did send a gift from both of us.

140
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,141
She's a remarkable girl.

141
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,202
The youngest appeals court judge
in New Jersey

142
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:38,699
and a two-time Olympic
bronze medalist.

143
00:06:39,695 --> 00:06:42,484
- You must be very happy.
- Why? I'm not marrying her.

144
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,072
So, how about you?
Are you seeing anyone interesting?

145
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,253
I'm not sure
about interesting, but...

146
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:50,991
Not the time, Sheldon.

147
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:52,202
Very well.

148
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:56,446
Shall we switch topics
to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?

149
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,787
It's all right, Sheldon.

150
00:06:58,912 --> 00:07:01,879
I will just pretend that Leonard's not
withholding information.

151
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:04,469
Although, I will point out, Leonard,

152
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:06,463
that I am a trained psychiatrist

153
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:09,397
and you are exhibiting the same
secretive behavioral tics

154
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:11,638
that accompanied your learning
to masturbate.

155
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:16,963
Isn't she brilliant, Leonard?

156
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:19,293
How I envy you.

157
00:07:22,217 --> 00:07:23,150
So, Howard,

158
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,101
have you and Rajesh
summoned the courage

159
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:27,029
to express your latent
homosexual feelings

160
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,543
toward one another?

161
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:34,171
What? No.

162
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:36,121
Why not?

163
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:41,502
Because we don't have latent homosexual
feelings toward one another.

164
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:43,406
I see.

165
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:47,174
No, really.
I have a girlfriend now.

166
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:49,042
Where is she this evening?

167
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:51,804
She had to go out of town.
Her grandmother died.

168
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
I see.

169
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:56,266
Her grandmother died.

170
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,448
Honest to God.

171
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:01,563
Leonard, tell her
I have a girlfriend.

172
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,607
I don't know
what you're talking about.

173
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:07,736
You don't know what I'm talking about?
Tell her I have a girlfriend!

174
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,177
All right.

175
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,865
He "has" a "girlfriend."

176
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,680
Her name is Bernadette.
She's working as a waitress,

177
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:17,830
but she's going to school
to be a microbiologist.

178
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,511
Keep in mind that the more passionately
you stick to this construct,

179
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:22,251
the more you're hurting
your partner.

180
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:30,192
Do you really think
your lips in my ear is helping?

181
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:32,928
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

182
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,199
Glad you're here. Sit down.
I'll get you a plate.

183
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:36,633
Mom, you remember Penny.

184
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:38,600
Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress

185
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,267
with the unresolved father issues.

186
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,708
Has he finally come to terms
with his little slugger growing breasts?

187
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,112
Well, he sent me a football
and a catcher's mitt for Christmas,

188
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,887
so I'm going to say no.

189
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:55,001
If it helps, we're all good
with your breasts.

190
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,496
Classic overcompensation.

191
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:04,585
Speaking of fathers, Leonard,
that reminds me, I'm divorcing yours.

192
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:08,172
- What?!
- Yes. He was cheating on me.

193
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,863
Yes, with some waitress
from the university cafeteria.

194
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:13,051
Can you believe it?

195
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,686
A waitress?

196
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,565
No offense, dear.

197
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,117
No, it sounded like a compliment.

198
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,396
- When did this happen?
- Well, let's see.

199
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,064
When did I leave Leonard's father?

200
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:28,442
September 22.

201
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:30,944
Yes, that's right.
The weekend after Leonard's dog died.

202
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,455
Mitzy's dead?!

203
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,969
She was old and blind, Leonard.

204
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:38,802
What choice did we have?

205
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,164
I don't believe this.
Why am I the last to know?!

206
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,338
Excuse me, I am the one
who's getting a divorce.

207
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:47,561
Mitzy is the one who is dead.
Why are you the one making a fuss?

208
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:50,255
You're right. I'm sorry.

209
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,333
I'm way out of line!

210
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:57,596
Penny, what's new in your life?

211
00:09:58,317 --> 00:09:59,960
Nothing. Not a damn thing.

212
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,545
Thank you for driving
me back to my hotel.

213
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,106
Oh, it's not a problem.

214
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:14,071
I was going to ask Leonard to do it,

215
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,099
but he seemed a bit
emotionally unstable

216
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:19,301
and you don't want someone like that
operating heavy machinery.

217
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,469
No, you do not.

218
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:23,681
Your "check engine" light is on.

219
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,033
Yeah, I gotta put
a sticker over that.

220
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:33,921
So, you must be devastated
about your divorce.

221
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:35,008
Oh, not at all.

222
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:37,752
But I am a bit distressed
to be in a vehicle

223
00:10:37,877 --> 00:10:40,627
that's not subjected
to regular maintenance.

224
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,547
Come on, I mean, you're not upset
that your marriage is over?

225
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:49,099
Well, initially I felt something
akin to grief and perhaps anger,

226
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,276
but that's the natural reaction
of the limbic system

227
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,795
to being betrayed
by a loathsome son of a bitch.

228
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:57,045
Sure, sure.

229
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,625
Thankfully, my shock was
somewhat mitigated by the fact

230
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,994
that I haven't had intercourse
with him in eight years.

231
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:03,787
Eight years?

232
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:05,210
That's nothing.

233
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:08,744
I've been responsible
for my own orgasms since 1982.

234
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:12,017
Yikes.

235
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:17,301
What's so funny?

236
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,994
That's exactly what I say
during orgasms: "Yikes. "

237
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:24,997
You know what? I could use a drink.
Do you want to stop for a drink?

238
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:27,282
- I don't drink.
- I do, I'll teach you.

239
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:35,492
What is it?

240
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:38,905
I made tea.

241
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:41,209
I don't want tea.

242
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:44,012
I didn't make tea for you.

243
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:47,792
This is my tea.

244
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:50,542
Then why are you telling me?

245
00:11:51,107 --> 00:11:53,007
It's a conversation starter.

246
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:56,381
That's a lousy conversation starter.

247
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,852
Oh, is it? We're conversing.
Checkmate.

248
00:12:00,946 --> 00:12:02,012
What do you want?

249
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:05,101
What I want is to be departing
the starship Enterprise

250
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,918
in a one-man shuttle craft
headed to the planetoid I rule

251
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,943
known as Sheldon Alpha Five.

252
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:12,533
I want that too.

253
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:15,192
Why are you here?

254
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:17,110
To comfort you, of course.

255
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:22,088
No, that's not going to work at all.

256
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,409
I'll comfort you from over here.

257
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,118
Leonard, what you're experiencing

258
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:33,540
is a classic Jungian crisis

259
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:36,788
in which the aging
individual mourns the loss

260
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:39,763
of the never-to-be realized
ideal family unit.

261
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,551
That's very comforting.

262
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,595
That's not the comforting part.

263
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,478
- It's not?
- No, no.

264
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,164
The comforting part
is that the Germans

265
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:51,478
have a term for what you're feeling.

266
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:52,604
Weltschmerz.

267
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:54,272
It means

268
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,790
the depression that arises from
comparing the world as it is

269
00:12:57,915 --> 00:13:00,727
to a hypothetical, idealized world.

270
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:03,714
You're right, I do feel better.

271
00:13:04,913 --> 00:13:07,438
Well, the Germans have
always been a comforting people.

272
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:11,867
Just remember, Leonard,

273
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,821
where your biological family
has failed you,

274
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:16,549
you always have me,

275
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:17,921
your surrogate family.

276
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:22,050
You're my surrogate family?

277
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:26,304
If it's any consolation,
I'm not happy about it either.

278
00:13:29,783 --> 00:13:32,733
Okay, now this time,
try drinking it all at once.

279
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:44,596
Yikes.

280
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:50,818
I've been responsible
for my own buzz since 2003.

281
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:55,534
Another round for me
and my homegirl.

282
00:13:57,158 --> 00:14:00,158
I feel a spreading warmth
through my extremities.

283
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,717
As long as you don't feel it
running down your pants, you're fine.

284
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:14,481
Oh, that is fascinating.

285
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:19,469
I'm noticing an immediate
lowering of my inhibitions.

286
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:21,722
For example,

287
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,159
I'm seriously considering
asking that busboy

288
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:27,395
to ravish me in the alleyway
while I eat cheesecake.

289
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,446
What do you think?

290
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,021
Well, we are known
for our cheesecake.

291
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:38,710
- Hit us again.
- Yes.

292
00:14:39,032 --> 00:14:41,632
If a little is good,
more must be better.

293
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,217
- Hey, Bev, guess what?
- What?

294
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,219
I'm sleeping with your son.

295
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:48,529
Really?

296
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,759
Which one?

297
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:57,149
The one from whom
I live across the hall... from.

298
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:01,131
Well, that's convenient.
How did his penis turn out?

299
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:06,936
Beverly, I can't talk to my boyfriend's
mother about his penis.

300
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:08,198
Fair enough.

301
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,967
What can you tell me, if anything,
about that busboy's penis?

302
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,376
Actually,
I've only had the cheesecake.

303
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:21,544
One more time.

304
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,799
You know, Leonard did not want
to tell you we were dating.

305
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:27,234
Really?

306
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,466
That means he's either
embarrassed about the relationship

307
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:32,529
or he doesn't care
enough about his mother

308
00:15:32,654 --> 00:15:33,890
to tell her he's in one.

309
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:37,458
Either way,
one of us should be insulted.

310
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:40,746
Well, let's go find out who.

311
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Go get a taxi.

312
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,578
I'm gonna slip my business card
into that busboy's back pocket,

313
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:50,227
cupping his firm, right buttock
as I do so.

314
00:15:56,028 --> 00:15:57,463
Sonny boy!

315
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,835
Get out here!
Your mommy wants to talk to you!

316
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:05,505
What the hell is going on?

317
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,861
You're in trouble.

318
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:12,637
Why didn't you tell me
you were tapping my homegirl?

319
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:21,187
- Did I say that right?
- Yeah, not bad, not bad.

320
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,329
Are you guys drunk?

321
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,110
I hope so.

322
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,638
Otherwise, why would we
have stopped at Del Taco?

323
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,991
Now, how could you not tell me
you were in a relationship

324
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,452
with this lovely,
charming young woman?

325
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,341
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

326
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:39,448
Is it because she's uneducated,

327
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:42,194
trapped in a menial
service position?

328
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:45,462
What the hell happened
to "lovely and charming"?

329
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,887
How come you didn't tell me

330
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:49,966
that you and Father
were getting a divorce?

331
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:51,635
Or that you had surgery?

332
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,054
How come you didn't tell me
my dog died?

333
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:58,748
What I hear you saying

334
00:17:00,257 --> 00:17:03,345
is that you want a more intimate
mother-son relationship.

335
00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:05,438
I do.

336
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,982
It's late. Now, go to bed.

337
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:34,023
I'm getting a warm feeling
spreading through my heart.

338
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,201
That's the Del Taco.

339
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,583
Why is Leonard
softly banging his head

340
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,440
against his bedroom door?

341
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:50,694
Speaking of warm feelings...

342
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,147
Come here.

343
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:03,951
No, I'd rather have the busboy.

344
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,708
Thank you for taking me
to the airport.

345
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:17,336
You're very welcome.

346
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,720
Once again, I'm driving.

347
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:21,651
I'm right here.

348
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:23,897
Please, I am very hungover

349
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:26,729
and in no mood to satisfy
your need for approval.

350
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,456
Sheldon, I do hope you'll forgive me

351
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:32,736
for my inappropriate
behavior last night.

352
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:35,447
I don't blame you.
You were intoxicated.

353
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,085
I blame Penny.

354
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:40,266
I blame Penny, too.

355
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,710
Bad Penny.

356
00:18:43,336 --> 00:18:45,268
Wait a minute,
what are you talking about?

357
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:46,833
What inappropriate behavior?

358
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:49,709
I think it's best that you not know.

359
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:51,141
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

360
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:54,905
What the hell... agreed.

361
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:59,012
And I want you to take
very good care of this young woman.

362
00:19:00,276 --> 00:19:01,473
Thank you, Beverly.

363
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:02,892
You're welcome.

364
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:05,685
She doesn't have much
in the way of career prospects.

365
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,730
Don't make her responsible
for her own orgasms as well.

366
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:15,612
Mother, remember when I was complaining
that you don't communicate enough?

367
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,680
- Yes, dear.
- I'm over it.
