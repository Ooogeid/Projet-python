1
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:03,628
Check this out.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,176
Leonard, she's doing it again.

3
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:13,804
I think it upsets Sheldon
when you play with the food.

4
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:17,151
It upsets Sheldon
when she willy-nilly takes it

5
00:00:17,276 --> 00:00:20,186
from the containers without regard
for its equitable distribution.

6
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:23,875
This is essentially
why you have famine in India.

7
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:28,239
You want me to put it back?

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,371
It upsets Sheldon
when you play with the Sheldon.

9
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:37,869
What's up, my nerd dizzles?

10
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,208
I want you to meet
my girlfriend Bernadette.

11
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,960
You know my girlfriend Bernadette.

12
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,229
Say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzles.

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,987
I don't think I can.

14
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:54,245
I don't have Howard's street cred.

15
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:59,383
I told my girlfriend Bernadette
she could join us for dinner.

16
00:00:59,508 --> 00:01:02,901
- Sure. The more, the merrier.
- Wa... no, that's a false equivalency.

17
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:04,480
More does not equal merry.

18
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:06,845
If there were 2,000 people
in this apartment right now,

19
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,568
would we be celebrating?
No, we'd be suffocating.

20
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:13,071
Don't "Sheldon" me.
We ordered for five people, not six.

21
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:16,237
It's fine. We'll just put it all
on the table, you know, family style.

22
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:19,146
Sure. And while we're at it, why don't
we put our hands behind our backs,

23
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:21,622
have an old-fashioned
eating contest?

24
00:01:22,336 --> 00:01:24,041
Relax, it'll be fine.
Sit down, you guys.

25
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:28,388
What?!

26
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:32,258
Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.

27
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:34,719
- Why not?
- That's where Sheldon sits.

28
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,220
He can't sit somewhere else?

29
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:39,212
In the winter,

30
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:41,677
that seat is close enough
to the radiator so that he's warm,

31
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,227
yet not so close that he sweats.

32
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:45,663
In the summer, it's directly
in the path of a cross-breeze

33
00:01:45,788 --> 00:01:47,636
created by
opening windows there and there.

34
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:49,853
It faces the television
at an angle that isn't direct,

35
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:51,322
so he can talk to everybody,

36
00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:53,940
yet not so wide
that the picture looks distorted.

37
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:00,415
Perhaps there's hope
for you after all.

38
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,971
Episode 310:
The Gorilla Experiment

39
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:07,929
Sync: Jess, Lin

40
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,350
www.subbercafe.fr

41
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:29,401
I love your shoes.

42
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:31,314
Oh, thanks.
They are cute, aren't they?

43
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:33,289
Where'd you get them?
Shoes for Less.

44
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:37,100
- I've been meaning to go over there.
- Oh, great selection, great prices.

45
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:40,261
My mother was right.
Hell is real.

46
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,914
Come on, Sheldon.
Let the womenfolk chat.

47
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:48,834
Womenfolk?

48
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:51,059
Gals?
Chicks?

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,997
Utero-Americans?

50
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:56,801
Just eat your dinner.

51
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,585
Don't take him too seriously.

52
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,113
A lot of what he says
is intended as humor.

53
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:04,558
I don't think it's very funny.

54
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:07,584
Me neither,
but he just lights up when I laugh.

55
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,678
Never let her go.

56
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:18,738
Howard says you're working on
fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.

57
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,282
I am.
Are you interested in physics?

58
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,660
I find it fascinating.

59
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:24,895
If I hadn't gone into microbiology,

60
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,158
I probably would have
gone into physics.

61
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:28,485
Or ice dancing.

62
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,892
Actually, my tests
of the Aharonov-Bohm

63
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:34,399
quantum interference effect
have reached an interesting point.

64
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:37,340
Right now, we're testing the phase
shift due to an electric potential.

65
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,467
That's amazing.

66
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,565
Leonard's work is nearly as amazing

67
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,919
as third graders growing
lima beans in wet paper towels.

68
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:49,228
While I appreciate the "Oh, snap,"

69
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:52,081
I'm uncomfortable having
your moist breath in my ear.

70
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:59,405
Are you going to try to set up
the voltages using tunnel junctions?

71
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:01,604
Yes, I am.

72
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,492
You want to see a simulation
on my laptop?

73
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:05,035
Oh, yeah, show me.

74
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:09,078
In microbiology, the most exciting
thing I get to work with is yeast.

75
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,241
Your shoes are delightful.

76
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:19,299
Where did you get them?

77
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:22,751
- What?
- Bazinga. I don't care.

78
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:32,646
Eat my dust,

79
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:34,715
racially stereotypical plumber.

80
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,113
That's not fair.
I got stuck behind a tree.

81
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:43,032
And a cow and a penguin.

82
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:44,950
Face it,

83
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,705
dude, whether it's a real car
or a virtual cartoon car,

84
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,956
you can't drive.

85
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,497
Just need a little more practice.

86
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,836
What you need is cheat codes,
motor skills and a magic genie

87
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,036
who grants wishes to little boys
who suck at Mario Kart.

88
00:05:01,773 --> 00:05:03,510
Can I talk to you for a second?

89
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,332
It's not about shoes, is it?

90
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:08,307
I don't think I could go
through that again.

91
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:09,808
It's not about shoes.

92
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:10,960
Then speak.

93
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:13,854
Actually, can we do it in private?

94
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:14,963
All right.

95
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:16,837
Go away.

96
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,380
I agree, it's rude,
but she asked for privacy.

97
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:23,781
Thanks.

98
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:26,298
Okay, so here's the thing:

99
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:30,204
I was wondering if you could
maybe teach me a little physics?

100
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:32,915
A little physics?

101
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,022
There's no such thing.

102
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:37,330
Physics encompasses
the entire universe,

103
00:05:37,455 --> 00:05:39,899
from quantum particles
to supernovas,

104
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:42,962
from spinning electrons
to spinning galaxies.

105
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,426
Yeah, okay, cool.
I don't need the PBS special.

106
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:49,125
I just want to know enough
so I can talk to Leonard about his job.

107
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,733
You know, like Bernadette does.

108
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:53,519
- Why can't Leonard teach you?
- 'Cause I want to surprise him.

109
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:55,524
Can't you surprise him
in some other way?

110
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:57,648
I'm sure
he'd be delightfully taken aback

111
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:59,462
if you cleaned your apartment.

112
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:03,022
Come on, this is important to me.

113
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,779
This would be a massive undertaking,
and my time is limited and valuable.

114
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,411
You're sitting here
playing video games all day.

115
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:12,955
Okay, point.

116
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,464
What sort of foundation do you have?

117
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:18,752
Did you take any science
classes in school?

118
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,921
Sure.
I did the one with the frogs.

119
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,937
The one with the frogs.

120
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,434
Actually, it was pretty cool.

121
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:31,265
A lot of the girls threw up,
but I gutted that thing like a deer.

122
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:34,284
I'm sorry, Penny. I don't think so.

123
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:37,380
Come on! A smart guy like you,
it'll be a challenge.

124
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:39,755
You can make it like an experiment.

125
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:42,412
Interesting.

126
00:06:43,307 --> 00:06:45,366
I suppose if someone
could teach sign language

127
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:47,091
to KoKo the gorilla...

128
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:50,784
I could teach you
some rudimentary physics.

129
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:51,794
Great!

130
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,105
It's a little insulting, but great.

131
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,100
- I'll be KoKo.
- Not likely.

132
00:06:56,225 --> 00:06:58,257
KoKo learned to understand
over 2,000 words,

133
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:00,836
not one of which had
anything to do with shoes.

134
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:06,254
Hey, fellas.
This is my girlfriend Bernadette.

135
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:08,895
My girlfriend Bernadette.

136
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,972
- Who are all those people?
- Have no idea.

137
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,103
Look, it's Howard
and his girlfriend Bernadette.

138
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,607
Thought I'd give the little woman
a tour of the old salt mines.

139
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:24,244
He doesn't mean salt mines.

140
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:26,205
He means where he works.

141
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,810
Yeah, no, I got it.

142
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:33,118
So, how's your experiment going?

143
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:35,798
Terrific, we're getting
the electron accelerator set up.

144
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,790
We should be ready to go
day after tomorrow.

145
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:40,876
- Boy, I'd love to see that.
- You're welcome to come.

146
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,045
Really?
Oh, that'd be great.

147
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,838
How exciting is that?

148
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,606
Like Hanukkah in July.

149
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:49,760
Do they have that?

150
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:56,044
You got me again.

151
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,862
This isn't non-fat yogurt.

152
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:02,314
This is fatty fat fat.

153
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:04,245
Excuse me.

154
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,445
Could you grab me a napkin, sweetie?

155
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,070
- Sure.
- Thanks, honey.

156
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:11,448
All right, what is your deal?

157
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:12,825
Excuse me?

158
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,578
Inviting my girlfriend to come see
your electron accelerator?

159
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:18,247
Yeah? So?

160
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:22,773
You really are a piece of work.

161
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:25,258
It's not enough
you get the prom queen,

162
00:08:25,383 --> 00:08:28,173
you have to get the head
of the decorating committee, too?

163
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:31,996
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play innocent with me.

164
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:33,382
I practically invented

165
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:36,034
using fancy lab equipment
to seduce women.

166
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:38,767
Has it ever worked?

167
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,586
Not so far,
but that's not the point!

168
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,065
Relax, I'm not interested
in your girlfriend.

169
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:46,549
I hope not.

170
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:48,836
Because you don't
want to mess with me.

171
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:55,775
I'm crazy.

172
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,030
I believe you.

173

00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:12,262
<i>teaching Penny physics.</i>

177
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,733
<i>I'm calling it Project Gorilla.</i>

178
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,309
Hey, Sheldon.

179
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,935
Come in. Take a seat.

180
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,646
<i>Subject has arrived.</i>

181
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:28,326
<i>I've extended
a friendly casual greeting.</i>

182
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:30,319
Ready to get started?

183
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:31,592
One moment.

184
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:38,822
<i>Subject appears well-rested
and enthusiastic.</i>

185
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:42,502
<i>Apparently, ignorance is bliss.</i>

186
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:47,080
All right, let us begin.

187
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:49,922
Where's your notebook?

188
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,007
I don't have one.

189
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,468
How are you going to take notes
without a notebook?

190
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,862
I have to take notes?

191
00:09:55,987 --> 00:09:58,680
How else are you
gonna study for the tests?

192
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,057
There's gonna be a test?

193
00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:02,106
Test-sss.

194
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:05,800
Here.

195
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,815
It's college-ruled.
I hope that's not too intimidating.

196
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,945
Thank you.

197
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,822
You're welcome.
Now, Introduction to Physics.

198
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:18,403
What is physics?

199
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:22,663
Physics comes
from the ancient Greek word "physika. "

200
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,084
It's at this point
you'll want to start taking notes.

201
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:32,556
"Physika" means the science
of natural things.

202
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:36,551
And it is there, in ancient Greece,
that our story begins.

203
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:38,178
Ancient Greece?!

204
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,222
Hush. If you have questions,
raise your hand.

205
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,018
It's a warm summer evening,
circa 600 BC.

206
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:49,064
You've finished your shopping
at the local market, or agora...

207
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:55,083
and you look up at the night sky.

208
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,638
There you notice
some of the stars seem to move,

209
00:10:58,763 --> 00:11:01,446
so you name them "planetes,"

210
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:02,992
or "wanderer. "

211
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:13,714
Does this have anything to do
with Leonard's work?

212
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,046
This is the beginning
of a 2,600-year journey

213
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:19,094
we're going to take together from...

214
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,728
the ancient Greeks

215
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:23,974
through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr

216
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:25,684
to Erwin Schrodinger

217
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:29,354
to the Dutch researchers
that Leonard is currently ripping off.

218
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:32,941
2,600 years?

219
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:33,999
Give or take.

220
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:36,516
As I was saying,
it's a warm summer evening

221
00:11:36,641 --> 00:11:38,141
in ancient Greece...

222
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,742
I have to go to the bathroom.

223
00:11:42,131 --> 00:11:44,756
- Can't you hold it?
- Not for 2,600 years.

224
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:57,272
<i>Project Gorilla, entry two.</i>

225
00:11:58,232 --> 00:11:59,718
<i>I am exhausted.</i>

226
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:20,148
It unhooks in the front.

227
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,032
That explains a lot.

228
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:29,906
<i>Howard, I'm home!</i>

229
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:32,241
Of course.

230
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:35,609
<i>Senior fitness was cancelled.</i>

231
00:12:35,894 --> 00:12:38,924
<i>It turns out you can forget
how to ride a bike.</i>

232
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:44,072
<i>I'm fine, but, oy,
did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.</i>

233
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:46,905
That's great, Ma!

234
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,774
<i>What's great about
an 80-year-old Armenian man</i>

235
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,999
<i>with half his chin scraped off?!</i>

236
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:55,390
- I guess I should go.
- No, don't move.

237
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:58,572
Hey, Ma, can I have
lamb stew for dinner?

238
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:02,450
<i>Lamb stew?
I'd have to go to the supermarket.</i>

239
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,088
Please? I got a real hankering.

240
00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:11,879
<i>Oh, I can't say no
to my little tushy face.</i>

241
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:15,108
<i>I'll be back soon.</i>

242
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:21,919
<i>Do you want the regular peas
or the Le Sueur?</i>

243
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:25,219
Always Le Sueur peas with lamb stew!

244
00:13:25,344 --> 00:13:28,056
<i>You're right!
When you're right, you're right!</i>

245
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,581
<i>What if they're out of the Le Sueur?</i>

246
00:13:32,706 --> 00:13:34,256
Then get the regular!

247
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:37,762
<i>All right! You don't have to yell!</i>

248
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,044
Sorry about that.

249
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,824
Let me put that on vibrate.

250
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:48,021
I'm already on vibrate.

251
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:51,121
You know, that one I got.

252
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:55,107
Howard, did you say something
to Leonard about me?

253
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:56,543
What do you mean?

254
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,675
He says if I go see
his experiment tomorrow

255
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,377
it might weird you out.

256
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:02,212
Really? He said that?

257
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:04,217
You're jealous of Leonard?

258
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:06,111
Me? No.

259
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:09,833
I may have mentioned
that it's a little inappropriate

260
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,392
to be asking another man's girlfriend
to his experiment

261
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:15,013
without first discussing it
with said man.

262
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:17,689
Do I need to ask your permission
to hang out with Leonard?

263
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:20,260
I didn't say anything like that.

264
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,455
I said Leonard has
to ask my permission.

265
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:29,057
Come on, I don't want to eat
lamb stew with my mother.

266
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:32,813
Damn, I was this close on the bra.

267
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,461
Now, remember, Newton realized
that Aristotle was wrong

268
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,093
and force was not necessary
to maintain motion.

269
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:45,467
So let's plug in our 9.8 meters
per second squared

270
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:46,743
as "A"

271
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:48,777
and we get force-- earth gravity--

272
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:52,702
equals mass times 9.8 meters
per second per second.

273
00:14:52,827 --> 00:14:55,138
So we can see that "ma" equals "mg"

274
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:56,978
and what do we know from this?

275
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:03,652
We know that...

276
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,079
Newton was a really smart cookie.

277
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:10,784
Is that where Fig Newtons come from?

278
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:14,788
No, Fig Newtons are named
after a small town in Massachusetts.

279
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,123
Don't write that down!

280
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:22,045
Now, if "ma" equals "mg,"
what does that imply?

281
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:24,715
- I don't know.
- How can you not know?

282
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,201
I just told you.

283
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,843
Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

284
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:31,805
You don't have to be so mean!

285
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:32,888
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:35,763
Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

287
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,855
- No, you just suck at teaching.
- Really?

288
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:43,567
Of those two explanations,
which one seems the most likely?

289
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:44,749
Oh, God...

290
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:47,445
Sheldon, I'm trying to understand,

291
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,967
but you're going too fast.

292
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:50,991
Can you just back up a little bit?

293
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:52,609
All right.

294
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,755
It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece...

295
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:58,456
Not that far back!

296
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:02,210
At what point
did you begin to feel lost?

297
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,338
I don't know.
Where were we looking up at the sky?

298
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,303
- Greece.
- Damn it!

299
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:11,595
There's no need to get frustrated.
People learn at different rates.

300
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:16,433
Unlike objects
falling in a vacuum, which...?

301
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:21,438
"ma" equals "mg"...?

302
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:23,664
- Squared?
- No.

303
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:26,404
- Aristotle?
- No.

304
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:28,635
Five?

305
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:32,302
Then I don't know.

306
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:37,092
- Why are you crying?
- Because I'm stupid!

307
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:39,553
That's no reason to cry.

308
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:43,275
One cries because one is sad.

309
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,648
For example, I cry
because others are stupid

310
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:47,273
and it makes me sad.

311
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:52,552
Okay, look, can we just please
forget about all this extra stuff

312
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,180
and can you just tell me
what Leonard does?

313
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,445
All right.

314
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:59,058
Leonard is attempting to learn

315
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:01,895
why sub-atomic particles
move the way they do.

316
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:04,492
Really? That's it?

317
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:06,483
That doesn't sound so complicated.

318
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,553
It's not.

319
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:09,528
That's why Leonard does it.

320
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,725
Okay, I just have one question.

321
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,285
What exactly are
sub-atomic particles?

322
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:19,204
A good question.

323
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,330
Thank you.

324
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:23,615
And to answer it, we first must
ask ourselves: "What is physics?"

325
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,709
Oh, balls.

326
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,254
It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece...

327
00:17:30,326 --> 00:17:32,258
Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.

328
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:33,718
What did I do now?

329
00:17:33,944 --> 00:17:37,194
I was in bed with Bernadette,
and you text-blocked me.

330
00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:39,474
What?!

331
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,681
We were completely naked,
about to devour each other when...

332
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,815
you text her that I have a problem
with her hanging out with you.

333
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:50,088
You do have a problem
with her hanging out with me.

334
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,070
Yeah, but that's not
what you tell her.

335
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,655
What was I supposed to tell her?

336
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,951
I don't know; something
that doesn't make me come off

337
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,018
as a petty, jealous douche.

338
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:01,178
And what would that be?

339
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,149
Come on, do I have
to think of everything?

340
00:18:07,158 --> 00:18:09,337
Hey, Leonard.
Am I too late to see the experiment?

341
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,053
- What are you doing here?
- Same thing you're doing here.

342
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,303
I came to see Leonard's experiment.

343
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,348
No, you didn't. You said
Leonard's experiment was stupid.

344
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:26,813
You told her
my experiment was stupid?

345
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:29,149
I was just repeating
what Sheldon said.

346
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:31,915
Let's not get off topic.

347
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,787
Bernadette, I need to apologize.

348
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:38,158
I was wrong to tell you
who you should be friends with.

349
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:40,493
Should I leave you two alone?

350
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,995
No, you should hear this.

351
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,581
Okay, good,
'cause I wasn't really gonna go.

352
00:18:45,831 --> 00:18:48,162
Look, I know I come off

353
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:51,010
as confident and worldly, but...

354
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,507
the truth is I'm not.

355
00:18:54,752 --> 00:18:55,952
We're shocked.

356
00:18:58,248 --> 00:19:01,723
Which is why I tend to feel
threatened by other guys.

357
00:19:02,136 --> 00:19:04,674
Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.

358
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:10,231
But I now realize
how foolish that is.

359
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:13,860
He had a panic attack once
when he got his head stuck in a sweater.

360
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,261
It was a full turtleneck.

361
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:19,282
Why aren't you helping me?

362
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:20,586
I don't know.

363
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:23,352
Maybe because I'm... crazy?!

364
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:31,169
Bernadette, please, I'm asking you
to give me another chance.

365
00:19:31,694 --> 00:19:34,696
What do you think, Leonard?
Should I give him another chance?

366
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,884
It's up to you. He didn't call
your experiment stupid.

367
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:41,262
Come here, tushy face.

368
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:46,387
"Tushy face. "
That is going on Twitter right now.

369
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:55,527
Raj, you should've seen
Leonard's experiment.

370
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,738
The interference pattern was so cool
when the electron beam was on.

371
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:02,158
Glad you enjoyed it. Most people
aren't that interested in what I do.

372
00:20:09,511 --> 00:20:11,543
Actually, that's not true, Leonard.

373
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:14,838
Recently I've been thinking that
given the parameters of your experiment,

374
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:18,158
the transport of electrons
through the nano-fabricated metal rings

375
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,316
is qualitatively no different
than the experiment

376
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:22,376
already conducted
in the Netherlands.

377
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:28,915
Their observed phase shift in the
diffusing electrons inside the ring

378
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,162
already conclusively demonstrated
the electric analogue

379
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:34,232
of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum-interference effect.

380
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,632
That's it. That's all I know.

381
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:44,325
Oh, wait...!

382
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,482
Fig Newtons were named
after a town in Massachusetts,

383
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:49,080
not the scientist.
