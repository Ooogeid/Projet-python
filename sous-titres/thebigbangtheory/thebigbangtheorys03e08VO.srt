1
00:00:02,362 --> 00:00:03,687
How much time do we have?

2
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:06,810
T-minus five hours, 37 minutes
to onset of meteor shower.

3
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:11,865
Our position is 34.48 degrees north,
118.31 west.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,763
That means the azimuth should be...

5
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:16,979
168.22 degrees relative
to magnetic north

6
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:19,727
with an elevation of 49.93.

7
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:21,052
Anything yet?

8
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,938
We have a signal, but no frame lock.

9
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:25,207
Hang on.
How about... now?

10
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,068
We did it.

11
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,517
We have the West Coast feed of HBO.

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,460
Ooh, <i>Real Sex</i>.

13
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,944
Every time I watch that show,

14
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:37,411
it's old women putting
condoms on cucumbers.

15
00:00:38,813 --> 00:00:41,248
All right, let's see
what's on the East Coast feed.

16
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:43,994
Oh, hey. Dune.

17
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,810
Not a great movie,
but look at that beautiful desert.

18
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,095
Too bad Sheldon
couldn't come with us.

19
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:56,180
It's just not the same without him.

20
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:07,223
This sucks.
I'm switching back to <i>Real Sex</i>.

21
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:11,826
Sheldon's log.

22
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:16,335
Stardate 63345.3.

23
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:20,248
While my colleagues are off
observing the Leonid meteor shower,

24
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,746
I have remained behind
to complete my paper

25
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:26,121
on the decays of highly excited
massive string states.

26
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:28,326
Although my research is going well,

27
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:31,201
I do miss the warmth
of human companionship.

28
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,474
Episode 308:
The Adhesive Duck Deficiency

29
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,992
Sync: Golgi, Loky

30
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,867
www.subbercafe.fr

31
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,862
And good evening to you,
Siam Palace.

32
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:08,365
This is Sheldon Cooper.

33
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,399
I'm going to be dining alone
this evening,

34
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:12,982
so I'll be reducing my usual order.

35
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:15,846
I'd like to start with one quarter

36
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:17,623
of the Assorted Appetizers Plate

37
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:21,273
and one half
of the Golden Treasure for two.

38
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:23,309
For heaven's sake.

39
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,080
In the mid-18th century,

40
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:28,078
King Rama IV of Siam
divided a huge empire

41
00:02:28,203 --> 00:02:31,577
amongst the colonial powers of Europe
in order to preserve his throne.

42
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:33,319
Surely, you,
his cultural descendant,

43
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,708
can handle pad Thai and dumplings.

44
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,573
Sheldon, help!

45
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,657
I need to go.

46
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,535
But you keep in mind
that my sharply worded comments

47
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,853
on Yelp.com recently took down
a local muffin store.

48
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:52,543
Come in! Hurry!

49
00:02:56,383 --> 00:02:57,672
I'm back here.

50
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:06,977
For God's sakes,
I'm in the bathroom!

51
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:10,275
Shall I come back at a better time?

52
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,541
Get in here!

53
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:15,133
Hurry!

54
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:18,802
Don't you dare knock!

55
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,244
Hello.

56
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:27,665
I slipped in the shower,
and I think I dislocated my shoulder.

57
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:30,000
Not surprising.

58
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,416
You have no safety mat
or adhesive stickers

59
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,053
to allow for purchase on a surface

60
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:36,564
with a low coefficient
of static friction.

61
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:38,783
What?

62
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:40,993
Tubs are slippery.

63
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,240
I know. I slipped.

64
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:45,521
I have a series
of whimsical duck stickers

65
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:47,346
on the bottom of my tub.

66
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:50,563
Will you just turn the water off
and help me up?

67
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:53,934
They're holding umbrellas.

68
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,318
- What?
- The ducks in my tub.

69
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,507
They're whimsical because ducks
have neither a need for,

70
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:02,638
nor the ability to use, umbrellas.

71
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,744
My God.
I got to go to the emergency room.

72
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:08,038
Assuming you're correct
that your right humerus

73
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:11,143
is no longer seated in the socket,
I would certainly think so.

74
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,836
- Can you drive me?
- I don't drive.

75
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:14,962
I can't drive!

76
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,840
It seems we've reached an impasse.

77
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,969
I could call you a cab
or an ambulance.

78
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,430
I can't wait that long.
You got to help me, please.

79
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:28,208
All right. Let it never be said
that Sheldon Lee Cooper

80
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,603
ignored the pleas
of a damsel in distress.

81
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,396
No one's saying that.
Let's go.

82
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:36,320
It does seem rather ironic
that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks,

83
00:04:36,445 --> 00:04:38,945
we both might die
in a fiery car crash.

84
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,210
I wish Penny didn't have to work.
She loves camping.

85
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:45,556
Would have been great.

86
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:46,989
You and Penny having sex

87
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:49,788
while I sit out here
and watch Howard hump a cactus.

88
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:55,892
The best I can tell,
there are eight other campsites nearby.

89
00:04:56,017 --> 00:04:57,422
Mostly science nerds like us,

90
00:04:57,724 --> 00:05:00,550
but just over yon ridge are two

91
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:04,303
not unattractive middle school teachers
who reek of desperation.

92
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:08,015
- Wonderful. How old are they?
- I don't know.

93
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:09,601
50, 55.

94
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,528
Menopause.

95
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:15,661
Nature's birth control.

96
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:19,056
Come on.
You guys can't be that hard up.

97
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,111
- I am.
- Me, too.

98
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:24,490
They gave me homemade cookies.

99
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:27,242
Of course, they did.
That's what grandmothers do.

100
00:05:27,663 --> 00:05:29,037
What are we waiting for?

101
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:29,954
Relax.

102
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,722
I said we'd stop by a little later
after they have their nap.

103
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:36,085
Good idea.
They'll be refreshed.

104
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:39,284
- Cookie?
- Yeah. Thank you.

105
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:44,343
Not bad.

106
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,861
Yeah, very tasty.

107
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:48,806
- Tell me more about these teachers.
- Not much to tell.

108
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,374
They had a VW microbus

109
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:53,560
and were wearing tie-dyed
Grateful Dead T-shirts.

110
00:05:58,627 --> 00:05:59,777
Good cookies.

111
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:08,356
I see no organizational
system in here whatsoever.

112
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:12,574
Which panties do you
wear on Mondays?

113
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:15,708
I don't need panties.
I just need shorts and a shirt.

114
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,410
My mother always told me
one should wear clean underpants

115
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:19,920
in case one is in an accident.

116
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,006
One was already in an accident.

117
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:25,134
Doesn't mean one won't be in another,
especially if I'm driving.

118
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,636
Clothes, Sheldon.
I need clothes!

119
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:29,471
Here.

120
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,808
Seriously?
Those shorts with that top?

121
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:34,762
All right.

122
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,444
Oh, that's cute.

123
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:47,869
We should have you checked
for a concussion.

124
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,931
Now, you got to help me
put these on.

125
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:52,953
- All right.
- But don't look.

126
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,831
- Don't look?
- I don't want you to see me naked.

127
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:58,461
That's understandable.

128
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:00,377
You may be interested to know

129
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,031
that a prohibition against looking

130
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:04,490
is well established
in heroic mythology.

131
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:07,384
Lot and his wife,
Perseus and Medusa,

132
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,219
Orpheus and Eurydice...

133
00:07:09,393 --> 00:07:11,793
They always look.
It never ends well.

134
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,136
Now you got help me get my arm
into the sleeve.

135
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:21,440
Is that my arm?

136
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,430
It doesn't feel like an arm.

137
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,397
Then, maybe you should let it go.

138
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:34,157
All righty.

139
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:49,147
Stars are pretty, aren't they?

140
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,472
Up above the world so high.

141
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:56,112
Like little diamonds in the sky.

142
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,094
That's beautiful, dude.

143
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:03,899
You should write that down
before someone steals it.

144
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,026
So, when do the meteors get here?

145
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,653
The meteors don't get here.

146
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:09,738
The Earth is moving into their path.

147
00:08:10,313 --> 00:08:11,624
I can feel it.

148
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:16,105
I can feel the Earth moving.

149
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:20,873
It's moving too fast.
Raj, slow it down.

150
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,869
Okay, how's that?

151
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:34,346
Better. Thanks.

152
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:38,823
Stars are pretty, aren't they?

153
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,356
What's so funny?

154
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:48,179
It's your American accent.
Everything you say sounds stupid.

155
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:51,738
"Stars are pretty, aren't they?"

156
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:03,125
For the record,
I should let you know

157
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,905
this is my first time driving
an actual motor vehicle.

158
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,840
You have your
learner's permit, right?

159
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:13,886
And I have logged a considerable
number of hours on a simulator.

160
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:16,101
- Good.
- Didn't work out well.

161
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,515
- All right, can we please go?
- One moment.

162
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,567
According to my driver's ed book,

163
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:22,992
the side mirror is properly adjusted

164
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:26,735
when the driver's door handle
is visible in the lower right corner.

165
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,917
There's the handle.
No, too far.

166
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:31,224
Bringing it back.

167
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:32,947
Optimized.

168
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:36,992
Now, where is the switch
to adjust the passenger side mirror?

169
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,511
It's right there.

170
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:42,748
Where is the passenger side mirror?

171
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:46,001
In a parking lot in Hollywood.

172
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:48,212
Can we please go?

173
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:50,548
As soon as I adjust my seat.

174
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:02,809
Oh, dear.
I'm going to have to start again.

175
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:14,071
If I could speak
the language of rabbits,

176
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:17,807
they would be amazed,
and I would be their king.

177
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,597
I hate my name.

178
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:25,405
It has "nerd" in it.

179
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:30,587
Len-nerd.

180
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:35,691
I lost my virginity
to my cousin Jeanie.

181
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,421
I would be kind
to my rabbit subjects.

182
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:43,785
At first.

183
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:47,438
You know what's a cool name?

184
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:48,743
Angelo.

185
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:53,326
That has angel and Jell-O in it.

186
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:56,605
It was my Uncle Murray's funeral.

187
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,224
We were all back
at my Aunt Barbara's house.

188
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:01,738
Our eyes locked
over the pickled herring.

189
00:11:01,863 --> 00:11:03,963
We never meant for it to happen.

190
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:08,458
One day, I hold a great ball
for the President of France,

191
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,610
but the rabbits...
they hate me and don't come.

192
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:13,020
I am embarrassed,
so I eat all the lettuce in the world

193
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:14,548
and make them watch.

194
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:18,879
People could call me Angie.

195
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:22,865
Yo, Angie, how's it goin'?

196
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:27,366
To this day, I can't look
at pickled herring

197
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:29,991
without being aroused and ashamed.

198
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,092
Cousin Jeanie.

199
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:41,642
Could you please drive
a little faster?

200
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,943
I think we're going
sufficiently fast.

201
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:47,831
What's that?

202
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,813
- The engine does that sometimes.
- It can't be nothing.

203
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:53,503
The check engine light is on.
We need to find a service station.

204
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,839
The light has been on
since I bought the car.

205
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:58,412
All the more reason
to consult with a mechanic

206
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:00,010
before it explodes.

207
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:02,606
It's not going to explode.
Just keep driving.

208
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,734
Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.

209
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:09,808
Mr. Spock did not pilot
the <i>Enterprise</i>.

210
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:12,684
He was the science officer,
and I guarantee you that

211
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,292
if he ever saw the <i>Enterprise</i>'s
check engine light blinking,

212
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:17,970
he would pull the ship over
immediately.

213
00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:21,263
Oh, God, I'm gonna lose the arm.

214
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,890
Red light.

215
00:12:23,015 --> 00:12:24,843
Release accelerator

216
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:28,940
and slowly apply the brake.

217
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:33,329
Nailed it.

218
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,740
While we have a moment,
may I ask you a question?

219
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:40,865
What?

220
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:43,564
Why do you have
the Chinese character for soup

221
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:45,597
tattooed on your right buttock?

222
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:47,572
It's not soup.

223
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:48,896
It's courage.

224
00:12:49,427 --> 00:12:50,577
No, it isn't.

225
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,698
But I suppose it does take courage

226
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:55,245
to demonstrate
that kind of commitment to soup.

227
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,569
How did you see it?
You said you wouldn't look.

228
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:03,688
Sorry.
As I told you, the hero always peeks.

229
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:16,395
- Anything?
- No. That was the last pudding cup.

230
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:21,108
What about Slim Jims?

231
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,845
That's what he used
to eat his pudding, remember?

232
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,819
Right. That was so good!

233
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,380
Sweety and meaty at the same time.

234
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,439
Wait. So you're saying

235
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:36,898
we're out of food?

236
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,526
The only thing in here
are blue ice packs.

237
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:41,931
I know they're poison,

238
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:45,202
but they look like big,
yummy otter pops.

239
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,479
- Oh, God, I am so hungry.
- Me, too.

240
00:13:50,982 --> 00:13:53,457
Check and see
if we have any more pudding.

241
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:02,937
All right, there's no need
to bark at me.

242
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,741
According to the inexplicably
irritable nurse behind the desk,

243
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:10,222
you'll be seen after the man
who claims having a heart attack,

244
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,694
but appears to be well enough
to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone.

245
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,879
We have to fill these out.

246
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:20,692
"Describe illness or injury."

247
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:23,085
I dislocated my shoulder.

248
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:24,930
All right.

249
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,482
And how did the accident occur?

250
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:29,529
You already know that.

251
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:31,939
"Cause of accident."

252
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:34,052
"Lack of adhesive ducks."

253
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:39,246
Okay, medical history.

254
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:41,213
"Have you ever been diagnosed
with diabetes?"

255
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,590
Kidney disease?

256
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:45,874
- Migraines?
- Getting one.

257
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:49,220
"Are you currently pregnant?"

258
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,639
Are you sure?
You look a bit puffy.

259
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:55,766
Change migraine to yes.

260
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:00,815
- "When was your last menstrual period?"
- Next question.

261
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:02,826
I'll put, "In progress."

262
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,615
Okay, moving
to psychiatric disorders.

263
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,617
"List all major
behavioral diagnoses,

264
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,179
"e. g. depression,
anxiety, etcetera."

265
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:15,163
What the hell does this have
to do with my stupid shoulder?!

266
00:15:15,526 --> 00:15:17,676
"Episodes of sub psychotic rage."

267
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:22,778
- Ass.
- "Possible Tourette's."

268
00:15:25,473 --> 00:15:29,037
All right. "Moles, lesions
or other skin conditions."

269
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,212
"Soup tattoo on right buttock."

270
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:36,034
I am scared and in a lot of pain.

271
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,436
Could you please take a break
from being you

272
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,550
for just a minute
and try being, I don't know...

273
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:42,725
comforting?

274
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:45,885
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,471
There, there.

276
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:52,592
Everything's going to be fine.

277
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,550
Sheldon's here.

278
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,444
Thanks. That's much better.

279
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,660
I'm so hungry!

280
00:16:17,362 --> 00:16:19,738
Will you shut up?
We're all hungry.

281
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:24,357
Okay, our objective is
the Boy Scout campsite to the east.

282
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:28,526
Easy target. Big doughy scout master,
couple of Cubs, mostly Webelos.

283
00:16:28,963 --> 00:16:30,196
What score we looking at?

284
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,824
Hot dogs, buns, s'mores.
I mean, it's a freaking 7-11.

285
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,085
Everyone grab flashlights.

286
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:41,656
Oh, my God, could it be?

287
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:45,503
My mother put an "I love you" brisket
in my backpack.

288
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:47,921
- Quick, get forks.
- You don't need forks.

289
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,364
It's so tender,
it falls apart in your hands.

290
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:51,539
He's right.

291
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,157
I feel like we're forgetting
something important.

292
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:04,899
Me, too. But what?

293
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,737
Maybe a Tupperware bowl
of roasted potatoes and carrots?

294
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:19,653
Now remember,

295
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:22,237
you were given
powerful pain medication

296
00:17:22,362 --> 00:17:23,832
and a muscle relaxer,

297
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,434
so, don't operate heavy machinery.

298
00:17:29,191 --> 00:17:31,441
Try not to choke on your own drool.

299
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:35,295
Wait. You have
to help me get into bed.

300
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,110
Sheldon has to get me into bed.

301
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,090
Bet you never thought I'd say that.

302
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:48,861
Yes.

303
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:53,289
The charm of your drug-addled candor
knows no bounds.

304
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:57,431
You know,

305
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:59,732
people think
you're this weird robot man

306
00:17:59,857 --> 00:18:02,872
who's so annoying all the time,
and you totally are.

307
00:18:04,408 --> 00:18:07,579
But then it's like that movie
Wall-E at the end.

308
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:09,823
You're so full of love,

309
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:11,670
and you can save a plant

310
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:14,545
and get fat people
out of the floaty chairs.

311
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,560
That's a fairly labored metaphor,

312
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:20,682
but I appreciate the sentiment
behind it.

313
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:23,932
Sing "Soft Kitty" to me.

314
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:30,775
"Soft Kitty" is for when you're sick.
You're not sick.

315
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:34,146
Injured and drugged
is a kind of sick.

316
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:47,276
Soft kitty, warm kitty,

317
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,771
little ball of fur...

318
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,109
Wait, wait.

319
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:52,666
Let's sing it as a round.

320
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,791
I'll start.

321
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:06,290
That's where you come in.
I'll start over.

322
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,379
I've got all night, Sheldon.

323
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,037
... and the next morning,

324
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:47,462
when he woke up,

325
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:50,251
he rolled over and realized...

326
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:56,319
... she was his cousin.

327
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:06,122
That's still not funny.

328
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:09,082
That's still not funny.

329
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:13,545
And she was my second cousin.

330
00:20:13,975 --> 00:20:15,925
And she was my second cousin.

331
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:23,221
- You're a real douche.
- Who cares? You slept with your cousin.
