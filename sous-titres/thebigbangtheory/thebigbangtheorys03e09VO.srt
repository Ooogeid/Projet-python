1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,015
So two years later,
there's a knock on the door.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,838
Guy opens it,
and there is the snail,

3
00:00:06,159 --> 00:00:08,489
who says, "What the heck
was all that about?"

4
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:13,220
I don't really get it.

5
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:17,649
Well, see, it took two years
for the snail to...

6
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:22,160
Not important.

7
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:25,608
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

8
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,939
Where do you think this is going?

9
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:31,697
To be honest, I was hoping
at least second base.

10
00:00:33,662 --> 00:00:34,700
You're so funny.

11
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:37,564
You're like a stand-up comedian.

12
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:41,493
A Jewish stand-up comedian,
that'd be new.

13
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:45,739
Actually, I think a lot of them
are Jewish.

14
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:49,882
No, I was just...
Never mind.

15
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:53,301
Look, Howard, this is our third date

16
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:55,304
and we both know what that means.

17
00:00:55,903 --> 00:00:56,903
We do?

18
00:00:57,278 --> 00:00:58,057
Sex.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,944
You're kidding.

20
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:05,176
But I need to know
whether you're looking

21
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:07,982
for a relationship
or a one-night stand.

22
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:11,946
Just to be clear:
there's only one correct answer, right?

23
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:15,305
It's not like "chicken or fish"
on an airplane?

24
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:17,910
Maybe you need to think
about it a little.

25
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:20,237
It's not unheard of

26
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:22,915
for a one-night stand
to turn into a relationship.

27
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:27,993
Call me when you figure it out.

28
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,029
Three dates means sex?

29
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:39,254
Who knew?

30
00:01:43,377 --> 00:01:44,594
Greetings, homies.

31
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:46,848
Homette.

32
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:49,692
Why are you back
from your date so early?

33
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:52,485
In romance, as in show business,

34
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,887
always leave them wanting more.

35
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:58,610
What exactly does that mean?

36
00:01:58,735 --> 00:01:59,923
He struck out.

37
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,707
Episode 309:
The Vengeance Formulation

38
00:02:04,827 --> 00:02:06,080
Sync: Jess, Lin

39
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,498
www.subbercafe.fr

40
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:30,109
Did either of you guys know
that three dates with the same woman

41
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,025
is the threshold for sex?

42
00:02:33,046 --> 00:02:34,945
I've never had three dates
with the same woman.

43
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,196
With Penny and me,
it took two years.

44
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,764
Now that I think about it,
that was three dates.

45
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:45,358
Before you and Penny hooked up,

46
00:02:45,483 --> 00:02:47,792
did she ask
for any kind of commitment?

47
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:51,509
No, she was pretty clear about
wanting to keep her options open.

48
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:55,173
I have something to announce,

49
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,547
but out of respect for convention,
I will wait for you

50
00:02:57,672 --> 00:02:59,611
to finish your current conversation.

51
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:01,013
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,168
The cultural paradigm
in which people have sex

53
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:04,433
after three dates.

54
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,601
I see.

55
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:08,233
Now, are we talking "date"
the social interaction,

56
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:10,165
or "date" the dried fruit?

57
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:14,920
Never mind,
what's your announcement?

58
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,983
Oh, good, my turn.
Well, this is very exciting

59
00:03:18,108 --> 00:03:20,226
and I wanted you to be
among the first to know...

60
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:23,953
I hear you're going to be on the radio
with Ira Flatow from <i>Science Friday</i>.

61
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:27,607
Thank you, Kripke, for depriving
me of the opportunity

62
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:29,791
to share <i>my</i> news with <i>my</i> friends.

63
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:31,114
My pleasure.

64
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,629
My "thank you" was not sincere.

65
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:35,756
But "my pleasure" is.

66
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:38,461
Let me ask you a question:

67
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,944
At what point
did National Public Radio

68
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:43,931
have to start scraping
the bottom of the barrel for its guests?

69
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:46,808
Don't answer.
It's rhetorical.

70
00:03:48,406 --> 00:03:50,437
Why are you such a stupid head?

71
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,703
That is also rhetorical.

72
00:03:55,858 --> 00:03:57,564
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

73
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,947
Are you really going to be on NPR?

74
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,983
Yes, they're interviewing me
by phone from my office,

75
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:05,010
regarding the recent so-called
"discovery"

76
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:07,348
of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices.

77
00:04:07,684 --> 00:04:09,956
It's pledge week
and they're trying to goose the ratings

78
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,584
with a little controversy.

79
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:14,253
Very cool, congratulations.

80
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,480
Thank you.
My mother is very excited.

81
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:19,105
She's convening
her Bible study group to listen in,

82
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,100
and then pray for my soul.

83
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:24,167
I was on the radio once.

84
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:26,446
I called in
to Fever 104 FM New Delhi

85
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:29,445
and was the fourth person
to say the phrase that pays:

86
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:32,396
"Fever 104, <i>aajke naye</i>
<i>acchha sangeetka ghar."</i>

87
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:37,104
That means: "Fever 104,

88
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:39,403
home of the really
good current music."

89
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:44,078
It's much catchier in Hindi.

90
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:47,713
All right.

91
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:49,478
These are the talking points

92
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:52,206
for my NPR interview tomorrow.

93
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,104
I need to make sure
they're simple enough

94
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:56,938
for the less educated
in the audience to understand.

95
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:01,050
Howard, look this over
and tell me what's unclear to you.

96
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:03,603
Excuse me, I have
a master's degree in engineering

97
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:05,727
from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

98
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:08,231
It required the completion
of 144 units of grad work

99
00:05:08,356 --> 00:05:09,850
<i>and</i> an original thesis.

100
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,855
Look this over
and tell me what's unclear to you.

101
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:20,021
When Sheldon gives you homework,
you don't have to do it.

102
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,733
In fact, it's better if you don't,
or it makes the rest of us look bad.

103
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:29,411
Talk to me.

104
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,462
I'm sorry, just screwing with you.

105
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:44,969
Why haven't you called Bernadette?

106
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,413
Did she say something?

107
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,264
She said she hasn't heard from you
in a week. I thought you liked her?

108
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,851
I do, but she wants a commitment

109
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,100
and I'm not sure she's my type.

110
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,333
She agreed to go out with you for free.
What more do you need?

111
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:59,790
Look, Bernadette is really nice.

112
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:02,039
I just always thought
when I finally settle down

113
00:06:02,164 --> 00:06:04,531
into a relationship,
it would be with someone,

114
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,990
you know, different.

115
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:07,616
Different how?

116
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:11,578
Well, you know, more like
Megan Fox from <i>Transformers. </i>

117
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,707
Or Katee Sackhoff
from <i>Battlestar Galactica. </i>

118
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,592
Are you high?

119
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,567
You'd have a better shot
with the 3-breasted Martian hooker

120
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:23,048
from <i>Total Recall. </i>

121
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:27,360
Okay, now you're just
being unrealistic.

122
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:31,889
Anyway, that movie was 20 years ago.
Imagine how saggy those thing would be.

123
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:38,831
Howard, you're going to throw away
a great girl like Bernadette

124
00:06:38,956 --> 00:06:41,525
because you're holding out
for some ridiculous fantasy?

125
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:45,279
Hey, just because you settled
doesn't mean I have to.

126
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:48,951
Excuse me, I'm sitting here.

127
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:52,197
Hey, I did not settle for Leonard.

128
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:55,896
I mean, obviously, he isn't
the kind of guy I usually go out with...

129
00:06:56,697 --> 00:06:58,247
you know, physically.

130
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:01,045
Again, I'm right here.

131
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:06,050
I do not judge a book by its cover.
I'm interested in the person underneath.

132
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:08,218
I am here, right? You see me.

133
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:18,036
I'm interested
in what's inside people, too,

134
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,993
but why is it wrong to want
those insides wrapped up

135
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:24,191
in, say, the delicious caramel
that is Halle Berry?

136
00:07:26,316 --> 00:07:28,461
Yes, you're delicious caramel, too.

137
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,289
- I will tell you why it's wrong...
- Excuse me, may I interject?

138
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,332
What?

139
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:40,244
Biologically speaking,

140
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:43,181
Howard is perfectly justified
in seeking out the optimum mate

141
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:45,505
for the propagation
of his genetic line.

142
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:47,840
Thank you, Sheldon.

143
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,929
Whether it's in the interest of humanity
is an entirely different question.

144
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:58,930
<i>This is Ira Flatow and you're listening
to NPR's Science Friday.</i>

145
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,506
<i>Joining us today by phone
from his office in Pasadena, California,</i>

146
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:05,399
<i>is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.</i>

147
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:07,455
This is gonna be a riot.

148
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:13,148
<i>Thanks for being
with us today, Dr. Cooper.</i>

149
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:14,781
My pleasure, Ira.

150
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,294
<i>Now, let's talk about
magnetic monopoles.</i>

151
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,523
<i>Can you explain to our audience
just what a monopole is?</i>

152
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:23,752
Of course.

153
00:08:24,393 --> 00:08:28,058
First, consider
an ordinary magnet which has,

154
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:31,258
as even the most uneducated
in your audience must know,

155
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:32,542
two poles.

156
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:36,822
A north and south pole.

157
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:40,994
If you cut that in half,
you have two smaller magnets,

158
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:43,772
each with its own
north and south pole.

159
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:48,318
<i>Dr. Cooper, I think there might be
something wrong with our connection.</i>

160
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,534
No, I hear you fine.

161
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:53,067
As I was saying,

162
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:55,809
an ordinary magnet has two poles.

163
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:58,328
The primary characteristic
of a monopole

164
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,805
is that it has only one pole,
hence, monopole.

165
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:05,586
<i>A requirement for string theory,</i>

166
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:07,546
<i>or M-theory, if you will,</i>

167
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,759
<i>is the existence of such monopoles.</i>

168
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:12,593
<i>I, myself, led an expedition</i>

169
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,746
<i>to the Arctic Circle
in search of said particles.</i>

170
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:17,097
<i>Kripke, I found the nozzle!
I'm going to kill you!</i>

171
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:26,259
So nice you could
join me this evening.

172
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:28,275
You're looking lovely as always.

173
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:31,311
Thanks, Howard.

174
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:34,260
Always nice to be part
of your masturbatory fantasies.

175
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:38,824
Come on, Katee.
Don't make it sound so cheap.

176
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,248
Sorry, fiddling
with yourself in the bathtub

177
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,177
is a real class act.

178
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:46,436
Thank you.

179
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:49,676
So, shall we get started?

180
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:52,811
Sure.

181
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:54,747
But can I ask you a question first?

182
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,822
Do you want to play
Cylon and colonist?

183
00:09:57,376 --> 00:10:00,020
No, I want to know why you're
playing make-believe with me

184
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:02,226
when you could be out
with a real woman tonight.

185
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:04,311
Bernadette?

186
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,230
No, I mean Princess Leia.

187
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:08,624
Of course Bernadette.

188
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:11,360
She's a wonderful girl
and she really likes you.

189
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:13,946
I know, but she's not you.

190
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:15,498
I'm not me.

191
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:20,160
The real me is in Beverly Hills
with a tall, handsome, rich guy.

192
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,246
- Really? Tall?
- Six-four.

193
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:26,627
You've got
a wonderful girl in your life,

194
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:29,376
and you're ignoring her in order
to spend your nights in the bathtub

195
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,647
with a mental image
and a wash cloth.

196
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,136
<i>What are you doing in there?</i>

197
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:39,963
I'm taking a bath!

198
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:42,188
<i>I hope that's all you're doing!</i>

199
00:10:42,313 --> 00:10:44,076
<i>We share that tub!</i>

200
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,146
Don't remind me!

201
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:52,939
Oh, man.

202
00:10:53,426 --> 00:10:56,085
All soaped up and no place to go.

203
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:05,789
How ya doin', buddy?

204
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,543
I was humiliated on national radio.
How do you think I'm doing?

205
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,336
Come on, it wasn't that bad.

206
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:13,380
What do you want?

207
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:16,491
We represent the Lollipop Guild,
and we want you.

208
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:25,100
Okay, so Kripke
played a joke on you.

209
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,393
It wasn't funny.

210
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:28,062
I thought it was funny.

211
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:29,646
You laughed.

212
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,482
Did you laugh?

213
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:35,566
I fell on the floor.

214
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,005
All right, he got you.

215
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,449
You can get him back.

216
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,460
I refuse to sink to his level.

217
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:43,809
You can't sink.

218
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:46,927
With all that helium in you,
you're lucky you don't float away.

219
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:52,169
Are you really admitting defeat?

220
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,587
I never admit defeat.

221
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:54,755
Good.

222
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:58,274
However, on an unrelated topic,
I'm never getting out of this bed again.

223
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:03,178
What if you could make Kripke look
even sillier than he made you look?

224
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:05,557
- I don't think that's possible.
- You're not helping.

225
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,886
I didn't come to help,
I came to mock.

226
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,129
What you need to do
is figure out a way

227
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:14,635
to exact vengeance
on Kripke, like...

228
00:12:15,755 --> 00:12:18,443
like, how the Joker got back
at Batman for putting him

229
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:21,036
in the Arkham Asylum
for the Criminally Insane.

230
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,826
He didn't just talk about his feelings
with the other psychotic villains.

231
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:27,496
He broke out and poisoned
Gotham's water supply.

232
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:31,193
Well...

233
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:33,809
I suppose I could poison Kripke.

234
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:36,040
It's a simple matter.

235
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:39,154
There are several toxic chemicals
that'd be untraceable in an autopsy.

236
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:43,361
Okay, uh, that's the spirit,

237
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:48,340
but let's dial it back
to a non-lethal form of vengeance.

238
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:54,272
How about we whoopee cushion
on his office chair?

239
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,324
He'll sit down,
it'll sound like he's flatulent,

240
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:58,892
even though he's not.

241
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:02,572
Let's keep thinking.

242
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:09,079
Gee, you're too late.

243
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:11,149
Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman

244
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:14,251
were just in here trolling around
for neurotic, little weasels.

245
00:13:14,914 --> 00:13:17,212
I came to talk to Bernadette.
She's working today, right?

246
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,589
But I don't think
she wants to see you.

247
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,715
Why not?

248
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,712
Come on, you hurt her feelings
by not calling her all week.

249
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:26,733
Plus, I've kind of been
talkin' some smack about ya.

250
00:13:28,197 --> 00:13:29,197
Hello, Howard.

251
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:31,351
Wait, Bernadette,
I need to talk to you.

252
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,320
- I can't now, I'm working.
- This will only take a second.

253
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:38,567
You asked me to think about where
our relationship was going, and I did.

254
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:47,472
Will you marry me?

255
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:52,353
Is this more comedy
that I don't understand?

256
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:55,619
No. I'm serious.

257
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:58,447
I'm never going to find
another girl like you

258
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,061
who likes me and is, you know...

259
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:02,346
real.

260
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:05,802
So, this isn't a joke?

261
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,756
Then you're insane.

262
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,516
I prefer to think
of myself as quirky.

263
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,478
Howard, we've only
been on three dates.

264
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,606
We haven't even had sex yet.

265
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:20,160
Fair enough.
When's your break?

266
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:27,732
Don't you just hate
when this happens?

267
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,835
All right, how's this for revenge?

268
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:40,721
A solution of hydrogen peroxide,

269
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:44,082
and one of saturated
potassium iodide.

270
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:46,808
- What's this?
- Mountain Dew.

271
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:51,512
Refreshing.

272
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,105
Now, we're going
to combine these chemicals

273
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,560
with ordinary dish soap,

274
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,232
creating a little exothermic
release of oxygen.

275
00:15:11,638 --> 00:15:12,786
Foamy vengeance.

276
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,037
Yes, exactly.

277
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,229
This is brilliant, Sheldon.

278
00:15:16,354 --> 00:15:18,208
How are we gonna deploy it
in Kripke's office?

279
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,980
Already taken care of.

280
00:15:20,264 --> 00:15:21,334
Observe.

281
00:15:22,827 --> 00:15:26,216
This is a live shot
of Kripke's lab via a mini webcam

282
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,809
I was able to install,
thanks to a dollar bill

283
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:31,221
discreetly placed
in the night janitor's shirt pocket.

284
00:15:31,924 --> 00:15:33,078
At the same time,

285
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:35,367
I also secured large quantities
of these chemicals

286
00:15:35,492 --> 00:15:37,513
above the tiles in the drop ceiling.

287
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:41,564
You remind me of a young Lex Luthor.

288
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:45,579
You flatter me, sir.

289
00:15:46,764 --> 00:15:48,295
Let me guess: motion sensors?

290
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,421
The reaction will be triggered

291
00:15:50,546 --> 00:15:52,575
when Kripke reaches
the center of the room.

292
00:15:57,548 --> 00:16:00,083
I gotta say, I am really impressed.

293
00:16:00,364 --> 00:16:02,847
This is truly
the Sheldon Cooper way to get even.

294
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:10,674
It may be low-tech,

295
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,799
but I still maintain
the whoopee cushion has comic validity.

296
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:16,474
Here comes Kripke!

297
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:18,568
Who is that with him?

298
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,050
I believe that's the president
of the university.

299
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,024
- And the board of directors. Abort!
- There is no abort.

300
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,514
- How could you not put in an "abort?"
- I made a boo-boo, all right?

301
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,821
<i>I think the board will appreciate</i>

302
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,673
<i>how well we're using
that NSA grant, President Seibert.</i>

303
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:35,131
<i>Right here we have
a micro-controlled plasma...</i>

304
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:45,651
Looks like the Ganges
on laundry day.

305
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:49,966
At least they don't know it was you.

306
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,140
<i>Hello, Kripke.</i>

307
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:55,472
<i>This classic prank comes to you</i>

308
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,618
<i>from the malevolent mind
of Sheldon Cooper.</i>

309
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:01,173
<i>If you'd like to see the look</i>

310
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,478
<i>on your stupid face,</i>

311
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:05,991
<i>this video is being
instantly uploaded to YouTube.</i>

312
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:09,194
<i>And a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter</i>

313
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:10,997
<i>and Raj Koothrappali</i>

314
00:17:11,604 --> 00:17:15,003
<i>for their support and encouragement
in this enterprise.</i>

315
00:17:17,674 --> 00:17:20,038
Well, I'm going back to India.
What's your plan?

316
00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:27,987
Here's your tip from table seven.

317
00:17:28,112 --> 00:17:29,125
Thanks.

318
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,215
Testing. Check.

319
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,383
Check two.

320
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,043
Now what?

321
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:35,970
You want me to throw him out?

322
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,138
No, that's okay.

323
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,942
Are you sure? He's small.

324
00:17:39,864 --> 00:17:42,426
I bet I can get
a nice, tight spiral on him.

325
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,616
I want to dedicate this number

326
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:48,162
to a great gal who I've done wrong.

327
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,867
<i>Bernadette</i>

328
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:56,068
<i>I am so sorry for</i>

329
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:58,993
<i>Trying to propose to you</i>

330
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:00,866
<i>Bernadette</i>

331
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,691
<i>You found it creepy</i>

332
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,401
<i>But that's just
the kind of thing I do</i>

333
00:18:10,245 --> 00:18:13,611
<i>I know now it was too soon
to talk of love</i>

334
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:18,054
<i>It was just a crazy idea
that came to me in my tub</i>

335
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,969
<i>But, Bernadette,
give me one more chance</i>

336
00:18:21,094 --> 00:18:22,308
<i>Sweet Bernadette</i>

337
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,060
<i>I'll get the hang of this thing</i>

338
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,062
<i>They call romance, Sweet Bernadette</i>

339
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,273
<i>I dream to once again</i>

340
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,780
<i>Kiss your lips, Sweet Bernadette</i>

341
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:32,299
<i>Sincerely yours</i>

342
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:34,198
<i>Howard Wolowitz</i>

343
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:38,776
Oh, I am so sorry.

344
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,430
Are you kidding?

345
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:43,455
That's the most romantic thing
anyone's ever done for me.

346
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:47,333
<i>Bernadette!
Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!</i>
