1
00:00:06,669 --> 00:00:09,072
Having a little trouble
catching your breath there?

2
00:00:10,705 --> 00:00:13,207
No, no, I'm good.

3
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,043
If my P.E. teachers had told me
this is what I was training for,

4
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:16,737
I would have tried
a lot harder.

5
00:00:16,738 --> 00:00:18,605
(laughing)

6
00:00:18,606 --> 00:00:22,843
"Do or do not.
There is no try."

7
00:00:25,113 --> 00:00:27,614
Did you just quote <i>Star Wars?</i>

8
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:32,686
I believe I quoted
<i>Empire Strikes Back.</i>

9
00:00:34,889 --> 00:00:37,057
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:39,293
I'm lying in bed
with a beautiful woman

11
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:40,694
who can quote Yoda.

12
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:45,632
(chuckles)

13
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:49,036
I love you, Penny.

14
00:00:52,907 --> 00:00:54,942
Oh...

15
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,380
Thank you.

16
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:04,084
You're welcome.

17
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:07,688
I just wanted
to put that out there.

18
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:09,323
Oh, yeah, no,
I-I'm-I'm glad.

19
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:10,591
Good.

20
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:12,125
Glad is good.
Yeah.

21
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:13,927
Yeah...

22
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:14,928
(clearing throat)

23
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:15,929
No, no...

24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,565
Um...

25
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:21,768
So, it's getting
pretty late.

26
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:23,670
We should probably
go to sleep.
Yeah.

27
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:26,373
Okay.
(nervous chuckle)
Yeah, probably.

28
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:27,975
Okay, good night, sweetie.

39
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:03,297
(gunfire and suspenseful music
playing on TV)

40
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:06,949
Hey, Leonard, where
do you come down on giant ants?

41
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:10,746
Sheldon says impossible.

42
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:12,481
Howard and I say
not only possible,

43
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:16,051
but as a mode of transportation,
way cooler than a Batmobile.

44
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:19,221
You are ignoring
the square-cube law.

45
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,689
The giant ant would be crushed

46
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,424
under the weight
of its own exoskeleton.

47
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:23,893
And for the record,

48
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,529
the appropriate ranking of cool
modes of transportation is:

49
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,831
jet pack, hoverboard,
transporter, Batmobile,

50
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:30,966
and then giant ant.

51
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:33,569
Seriously?

52
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,937
You have nothing better to do

53
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:38,941
than sit around and discuss
the possibility of giant ants?

54
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:40,442
What's with him?

55
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:44,146
Perhaps he's at a sensitive
point in his monthly cycle.

56
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:49,185
Are you saying
he's man-strating?

57
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,055
Not literally.

58
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,558
But as far back
as the 17th century,

59
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,526
scientists observed
a 33-day fluctuation

60
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:58,928
in men's hormone levels.

61
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,696
Interesting.

62
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:04,433
That might explain my weepy days
in the middle of the month.

63
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:08,170
You know what I'm talking about.

64
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,311
Okay, forget
giant ants.

65
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:17,580
How about giant rabbits?

66
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,549
Big or small,
I don't like rabbits.

67
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,451
They always look like they're
about to say something,

68
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,320
but they never do.

69
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:26,455
Rabbits do have
a respiratory system

70
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,157
that would support great size.

71
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:30,726
And on a side note, they
are one of the few mammals

72
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:33,963
whose scrotum is in front
of the penis.

73
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,668
Maybe that's what
they want to talk about.

74
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:42,004
Leonard, where do you
stand on giant rabbits

75
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:43,739
and scrotal position?

76
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,008
I honestly don't care.

77
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:47,710
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Really?

78
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:50,212
Because every time we've talked
about unusual animal genitals,

79
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:51,914
you've always had
some pretty strong

80
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:53,215
and controversial opinions.

81
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,651
What do you want from me?

82
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,620
I just don't give a rat's ass.

83
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:01,924
Would that be a giant rat's ass?

84
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,927
For the record,
giant rats are possible.

85
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:06,729
Can we please talk
about something else?

86
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,730
Maybe something vaguely related

87
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:09,832
to life as we know it
on this planet?

88
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,834
Okay, how about this
for a topic:

89
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:16,472
Why is Leonard being
a giant douche?

90
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:19,875
Assuming giant douches
are possible.

91
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:21,410
Of course they are.

92
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:23,479
Leonard's being one.

93
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,448
Maybe he's having
a lover's spat with Penny.

94
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,083
No, there was no spat.

95
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:30,486
Oh, but something happened.

96
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:31,887
I don't want to talk about it.

97
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:34,857
But I sense you're going to and
I don't want to hear about it.

98
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,558
Excuse me.

99
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:38,327
What'd you do, Romeo?

100
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,329
You pour maple syrup
all over your body

101
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,532
and ask her if she was in
the mood for a short stack?

102
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,139
Did you think it would be funny
to put on a pair of her panties

103
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,375
and jump around, but it wound up
just creeping her out?

104
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,878
What? No.

105
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,780
I'm just asking, dude.

106
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:00,282
It happens.

107
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:04,253
You guys still on
for bowling tonight?

108
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:05,654
Oh, yes.

109
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:08,924
In fact, I've prepared some
trash talk for the occasion.

110
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:11,226
You bowl like your mama.

111
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,696
Unless, of course,
she bowls well.

112
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:15,497
In which case,
you bowl nothing like her.

113
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:18,867
Oh. Ouch.

114
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:22,805
That is what is referred
to as a burn on you.

115
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,875
Did you ask her
to start waxing?

116
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:27,843
No.

117
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,812
Did you start waxing?

118
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:30,946
No.

119
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:32,614
While making love,

120
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:34,516
did you accidentally
spank your own ass

121
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:36,819
and cry out, "Mommy"?

122
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:45,794
I'm walking away from you now.

123
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:48,163
That wasn't a no.

124
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah, I think
we're getting close.

125
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:55,804
Did you take a Benadryl and fall
asleep while pleasuring her?

126
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:58,640
Because you can die that way.

127
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:01,510
Oh, that would be
a good way to go.

128
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,080
Hi.

129
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:06,015
Oh, hey.

130
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:07,149
Good, Penny.

131
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,951
Reminder: bowling tonight
at 7:00.

132
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,953
Oh, right, bowling.

133
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,188
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

134
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:14,690
No, no, it's okay.

135
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:17,326
I mean, let's face it, you guys
would get creamed without me.

136
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:18,694
We would indeed.

137
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:20,095
In this particular case,

138
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:22,965
your lack of femininity
works to our advantage.

139
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:27,669
It's always nice
chatting with you, Sheldon.

140
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,605
Sarcasm?

141
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:32,508
Thinly veiled contempt.

142
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,644
Remember: 7:00.
Got it.

143
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,113
Pacific Daylight time!
Bite me!

144
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:41,884
Please reserve that butch spirit
for the lanes.

145
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:49,191
(coughs)

146
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:51,627
I thought you were bringing
your own bowling shoes.

147
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:55,097
These are my own bowling shoes.

148
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:57,066
Then what's with
the disinfectant?

149
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:59,435
I know where my feet have been.

150
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,873
Hey, Penny!

151
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:07,009
And you guys.

152
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:11,747
Albino Bob couldn't make it,
so I brought a substitute.

153
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:13,882
I believe some of you know

154
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:16,351
Wil Wheaton.

155
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:20,222
Hi, Sheldon. How's it going?

156
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:22,858
Well, well, well.

157
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,793
If it isn't Wil Wheaton,

158
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:27,429
the Green Goblin
to my Spider-Man.

159
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,731
the Pope Paul V
to my Galileo,

160
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:32,668
the Internet Explorer
to my Firefox.

161
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,403
You're not still
carrying a grudge

162
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:37,439
because I beat you at
that card tournament, are you?

163
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,874
I'm the proud owner

164
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,076
of WilWheatonstinks.com, .net,
and .org.

165
00:07:41,077 --> 00:07:42,444
What does that tell you?

166
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:46,248
It tells me that I am
living rent-free right here.

167
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,617
You ready to bowl?

168
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:50,285
Oh, I'm ready.

169
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:53,122
I don't know if Stuart told you
what you're up against tonight,

170
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:55,657
but before you stands
the co-captain of the

171
00:07:55,658 --> 00:08:00,028
East Texas Christian Youth
Holy Roller Bowling League
championship team.

172
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,365
Seven- to 12-year-old division.

173
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,767
Also, Penny's
pretty good.

174
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,839
Great. Then it's on.

175
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:17,579
Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton,
it was never off.

176
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:21,316
Yes!

177
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:23,652
A common spare.

178
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:26,889
The Miss Congeniality
of the bowling pageant.

179
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,090
Before you jump
on Twitter

180
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,425
to tout your modest
accomplishment,

181
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,895
watch how it's really done.

182
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:36,131
I am the ball.

183
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:39,234
My thoughts are its thoughts.

184
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:41,770
Its holes are my holes.

185
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,381
Yes.

186
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:53,715
Tweet that,
Tweety Bird.

187
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:57,152
Hey, I just wanted
to tell you

188
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:58,487
I'm a big fan.

189
00:08:58,488 --> 00:08:59,922
Oh, thanks.

190
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:02,457
I'm sure you're probably sick
of <i>Star Trek</i> questions,

191
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,826
but Whoopi Goldberg--
you ever hit that?

192
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,099
Ah, beer.

193
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,003
The magic elixir that can turn
this poor, shy Indian boy

194
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:17,272
into the life of the party.

195
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:23,845
Oh, yeah.

196
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,748
Chili cheese fry?

197
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:29,351
Yes. I love
chili cheese fries.

198
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:30,919
Really? You love them?

199
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,054
Yeah, why?

200
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:34,156
No reason.
I'm just glad to hear

201
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,826
you're comfortable saying
you love something.

202
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,295
Do you really want to get
into this right now?

203
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:41,964
Get into what?

204
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:44,066
Why wouldn't you love
the chili cheese fries?

205
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,201
They've been in your
life a long time.

206
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,502
They make you happy.

207
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,204
They deserve to know.

208
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:52,140
Look, you just caught me
by surprise last night.

209
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:53,775
I didn't know what to say.

210
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:55,711
Okay, well, now you've had
some time to think about it.

211
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:56,979
So, what do you want to say?

212
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,313
I'm not sure.

213
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:00,182
How can you not be sure?

214
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,150
Okay, this isn't the place
to have this conversation.

215
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:04,486
No, the place to have
the conversation was in bed

216
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:06,121
after I said, "I love yo""

217
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:08,023
and you said, "Thank you.
Good night""

218
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,192
Don't push it, Leonard.

219
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,094
I am not pushing anything.
You are.

220
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,997
You don't get to decide when
I'm ready to say "I love you!"

221
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:23,405
Ah, the premature
"I love you."

222
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:27,709
I guessed "premature."
Does that count?

223
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:35,296
Penny.

224
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:37,324
Penny.

225
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:40,957
Penny.

226
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:43,760
What?

227
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:45,395
This is for you.

228
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:48,365
Ice cream?

229
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:51,935
I've been familiarizing myself
with female emotional crises

230
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:55,205
by studying the
comic strip <i>Cathy.</i>

231
00:10:57,108 --> 00:11:01,411
When she's upset, she says,
"Ack!" and eats ice cream.

232
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:06,049
Um...

233
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,684
Ack!

234
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,856
If you were a cat, I would have
brought you a lasagna.

235
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:16,359
Did Leonard send you over here?

236
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,061
No, we haven't spoken

237
00:11:18,062 --> 00:11:19,963
since your abrupt departure
last night

238
00:11:19,964 --> 00:11:21,498
caused us to forfeit to Stuart

239
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:23,767
and his dastardly ringer
Wil Wheaton.

240
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,835
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

241
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:29,406
I'm not too proud to admit
that I cried myself to sleep.

242
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,574
Again, I'm sorry.

243
00:11:30,575 --> 00:11:32,776
And let me tell you,
sleep did not

244
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,844
come easily with Leonard
in the next room

245
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:37,814
singing along
with Alanis Morrisette.

246
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:40,850
You're kidding.

247
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:43,653
No. Clearly another woman
in dire need of ice cream.

248
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:46,356
All right, Sheldon,
what part of this

249
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:47,824
is supposed to make me
feel better?

250
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:49,459
The part where
I tell you

251
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,860
I've engineered a rematch

252
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:53,163
with Stuart's team
for tonight.

253
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:55,065
Oh, honey, I don't know.

254
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:57,000
Things are a little weird
with Leonard right now.

255
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:59,169
You want me to remove
him from the team?

256
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,971
I'm the captain.
I can do that.

257
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:03,607
No, no, that's okay.

258
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:06,176
Just let me talk to him,
and I'll get back to you.

259
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:08,912
When are you going
to talk to him?

260
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:11,181
I don't know.

261
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:13,483
He's in the laundry room now.
Now woulbe a good time.

262
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:16,720
You're not gonna leave me alone
until I do it, are you?

263
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:20,056
Oh, I think we both know
the answer to that question.

264
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:27,764
I think we should
talk now.

265
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:30,467
Wha...? No, it's okay.

266
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:33,069
We don't have to talk 'cause
there's nothing to talk about.

267
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,104
Everything's good.

268
00:12:34,105 --> 00:12:35,672
Really?

269
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,173
So, you didn't get all snarky

270
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:40,510
'cause I said somethingice
to a bowl of chili fries?

271
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,613
All right, maybe I overreacted.

272
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:47,050
So we're in two different places
emotionally. So what?

273
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:50,020
And maybe I'm a little ahead
of you. That's fine.

274
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:52,822
In fact, it makes sense,
'cause let's face it,

275
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:55,792
I've been in this relationship
two years longer than you.

276
00:12:57,762 --> 00:13:01,031
Look, Leonard, you <i>have</i>
how much I care about you.

277
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:02,932
It's just that I've
said the "L" word

278
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:06,202
too soon before, and it
didn't work out very well.

279
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,837
Really?

280
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:09,406
I wouldn't know
what that's like.

281
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:10,740
I'm sorry.

282
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:12,709
You know what I'm
talking about, though.

283
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,677
Yeah, I <i>do.</i>

284
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:16,112
So, we're good?

285
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:18,715
Yes, that's what
I'm telling you.

286
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:20,950
We are good. We are great.

287
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:23,053
All right! Fence mended,
problem swept under the rug.

288
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:25,188
Time to bowl!

289
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:27,590
Yes, I was eavesdropping.

290
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:29,426
There's a lot at stake here.

291
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:33,963
Attention, all bowlers:

292
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:37,467
I've taken the liberty of having
these made for our rematch.

293
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,338
"The Wesley Crushers"?

294
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,739
No, not The Wesley Crushers.

295
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,974
The Wesley <i>Crushers.</i>

296
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:46,109
I don't get it.

297
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,344
Wesley Crusher was

298
00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:50,213
Wil Wheaton's character
on <i>Star Trek.</i>

299
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:51,448
Still don't get it.

300
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:53,817
It's a blindingly clever play
on words.

301
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:56,453
By appropriating his character's
name and adding the S,

302
00:13:56,454 --> 00:14:01,124
we imply that we we'll be
the <i>crushers</i> of Wesley.

303
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:03,326
Okay, I'm sorry, honey,

304
00:14:03,327 --> 00:14:05,562
but The Wesley Crushers sounds
like a bunch of people

305
00:14:05,563 --> 00:14:06,730
who like Wesley Crusher.

306
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:08,932
No! Again,
it's not the Wesley Crushers.

307
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:11,501
It's the Wesley <i>Crushers.</i>

308
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,239
No, if you want it to mean
you're crushing Wesley,

309
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,341
it'd be the <i>Wesley</i> Crushers.

310
00:14:18,342 --> 00:14:20,276
Do you people even hear
yourselves?

311
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,945
It's not The Wesley Crushers.

312
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:23,279
It's not The <i>Wesley</i> Crushers.

313
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,815
It's The Wesley <i>Crushers.</i>

314
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:26,916
Hey, look.

315
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:28,785
They named their team after me.

316
00:14:29,854 --> 00:14:31,321
No, it's not the...

317
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:32,989
Never mind.

318
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:39,162
So, we're all clear on the bet
and the stakes?

319
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:41,931
Oh, yes. The losers will be
publicly humiliated

320
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:44,200
in a fashion to be chosen
by the victor.

321
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:48,071
FYI: I plan on having you
publish a scientific paper

322
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:51,674
expounding the discredited
Velikovsky hypothesis.

323
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,011
Ouch again.

324
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:57,981
Hey, Sheldon,

325
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,450
I just wanted you to know

326
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:02,485
that I'm really looking forward
to wiping the floor with you.

327
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,753
Oh, yes?

328
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:07,424
Well, before I respond,
let me ask you a question.

329
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:10,427
Is your mother
a good or poor bowler?

330
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:17,934
After you.

331
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:19,969
No, after you... as we are

332
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,773
currently crushing you, Wesley.

333
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:26,810
It's customary

334
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:30,180
for the player on the right-hand
lane to bowl first.

335
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:33,483
All right.

336
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,460
It's a custom, not a rule.

337
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:46,796
I so loathe you.

338
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:48,865
That's right, Sheldon.

339
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:51,201
Embrace the dark side.

340
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,172
That's not even
from your franchise!

341
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,042
I, um, I want you
to know that

342
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:02,479
even though we're
on opposite sides,

343
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,714
I, I bear you no ill will.

344
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:07,183
Thank you, Stuart.
It's nice to know.

345
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:08,485
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

346
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:10,019
People from
opposite sides

347
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,654
often have good
relationships.

348
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,356
You know,
Romeo and Juliet...

349
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:16,092
Tony and Maria
from <i>West Side Story,</i>

350
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:21,164
what's-his-name and the
big blue chick in <i>Avatar.</i>

351
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,400
I'm gonna bowl now.

352
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:29,172
Be the ball, Howard.

353
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:31,741
Leave me alone, Sheldon.

354
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,784
You weren't the ball.

355
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,722
PENNY:
Hey, thanks.

356
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:47,023
This is fun, huh?

357
00:16:47,024 --> 00:16:48,324
Yeah.

358
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:50,393
It's good that we got out
and did something physical.

359
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:52,862
Mm-hmm.
Gets us out of our heads.

360
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:54,364
You get in your head,

361
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:56,065
you start to overthink,
overanalyze,

362
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:57,367
obsess, you worry.

363
00:16:57,368 --> 00:16:58,868
That's not what
we're doing tonight.

364
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:00,870
Tonight we're just throwing
a ball at some pins.

365
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:02,305
Yeah, that's right.

366
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:04,007
Mm-hmm, and someday--
we don't know when--

367
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:05,708
maybe you'll love me back.

368
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:09,279
Ooh, I'm up.

369
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:15,151
ALL (chanting):
Shel-don! Shel-don!
Shel-don! Shel-don!

370
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:16,753
Excuse me.

371
00:17:16,754 --> 00:17:21,124
I don't know <i>who</i> you're chanting
for as I am currently the ball.

372
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,894
The ball! The ball!

373
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:30,400
The ball! The ball!
The ball! The ball!

374
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:33,303
Thank you, Jesus!

375
00:17:35,506 --> 00:17:37,407
As my mother would say.

376
00:17:42,212 --> 00:17:43,680
I'm glad you
patched things up

377
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:45,014
with your boyfriend.

378
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:47,083
Oh, yeah, me, too.

379
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:49,118
It's always tough when
the "L" bomb gets dropped

380
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,753
and you're not
ready for it.

381
00:17:50,754 --> 00:17:52,221
Tell me about it.

382
00:17:52,222 --> 00:17:54,023
I dated this one girl,

383
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:56,926
and I told her
that I loved her,

384
00:17:56,927 --> 00:17:59,262
and she said
she wasn't sure.

385
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:02,198
And she strung me along
for almost two years.

386
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,466
It was brutal.

387
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,468
Oh, I'm sorry.

388
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:06,669
Thanks.

389
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,539
I wish she had just broken up
with me right there,

390
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,008
and put me out
of my misery.

391
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,009
Really?

392
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,410
Yeah, would have
been kinder.

393
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:15,712
Wil, you're up.

394
00:18:15,713 --> 00:18:17,347
Oh, that's me.

395
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:24,587
Did you let Wil Wheaton
get in your head?

396
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:25,855
What are you talking about?

397
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:28,658
He's evil.
He plays evil mind games.

398
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:30,526
Did he tell you
his grandmother died?

399
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,594
No!

400
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:33,396
Well, if he does,
don't believe it.

401
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:36,032
He's not above playing
the dead meemaw card.

402
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,437
Yes!
(grunts)

403
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:43,940
Enjoy the accolades now,
Wil Wheaton,

404
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:46,075
but like your time
on <i>Star Trek: Next Generation,</i>

405
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:49,545
your smug self-satisfaction
will be short-lived.

406
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:52,215
Penny, you're up.

407
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,283
All right, remember,
his meemaw's alive

408
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:55,451
and be the ball.

409
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:57,353
Yeah, I got it.

410
00:18:57,354 --> 00:18:58,888
We really need
a strike here.

411
00:18:58,889 --> 00:18:59,856
I know.

412
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:01,724
So just take your time
and concentrate.

413
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:02,692
Leonard, stop pressuring me.

414
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:03,760
I'm not pressuring you.

415
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:05,628
Yeah, you are!
Just back off!

416
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:07,397
Okay, I'm sorry.

417
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:08,431
I'll shut up.

418
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:09,799
(sighs)

419
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,101
I didn't mean "shut up."

420
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:16,072
Fine. Just tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

421
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,908
(sighs):
No...

422
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,076
this isn't fair

423
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,778
to you, Leonard. I'm sorry.

424
00:19:23,113 --> 00:19:24,447
Wait! Where are you going?

425
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:25,782
Penny, come back!

426
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:27,150
I'll get you ice cream!

427
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:29,452
No, let her go.

428
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:30,586
Are you insane?

429
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,789
If she leaves, it's over!

430
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,125
I'm pretty sure
it's already over.

431
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:38,861
Tough luck, Sheldon.

432
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,765
You did this, didn't you?

433
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,934
Do you think I would
really break up a couple

434
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,335
just to win
a bowling match?

435
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:48,705
No, I suppose not.

436
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:50,773
Good. Keep thinking that.

437
00:19:54,378 --> 00:19:56,946
<i>Whea-ton!</i>

438
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:03,621
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah,
I'm telling you,

439
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:08,124
the Match.com chicks are much
looser than on eHarmony.

440
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,428
You know,
I-I gotta call you back.

441
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:15,064
I won a bet,
and it's time to collect.

442
00:20:28,545 --> 00:20:31,781
I don't know about you,
but I feel empowered.
