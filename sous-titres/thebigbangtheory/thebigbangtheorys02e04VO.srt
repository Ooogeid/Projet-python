1
00:00:00,419 --> 00:00:02,672
Let's see,
Raj was the kung pao–chicken.

2
00:00:02,947 --> 00:00:05,080
- I'm the dumplings.
- Yes, you are.

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,119
Creepy, Howard.

4
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:10,263
Creepy good or creepy bad?

5
00:00:11,953 --> 00:00:13,647
Who was the shrimp
with lobster sauce?

6
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:17,167
That would be me.
Come to papa, you un-kosher delight.

7
00:00:19,123 --> 00:00:21,274
I'm not necessarily
talking to the food.

8
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:28,213
Sit over there.

9
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:34,588
Sit over there.

10
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:45,513
Baby wipe?

11
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:48,635
- Why do you have...
- No, don't ask! Don't!

12
00:00:50,168 --> 00:00:51,504
I'll tell you why.

13
00:00:52,374 --> 00:00:54,944
I had to sanitize my hands
because the university

14
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:58,102
replaced the paper towels
in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.

15
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:00,277
I thought the blowers
were more sanitary.

16
00:01:00,473 --> 00:01:01,898
- Really, don't.
- Why...?

17
00:01:02,484 --> 00:01:05,072
Hot air blowers
are incubators and spewers

18
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:06,973
of bacteria and pestilence.

19
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:08,593
Frankly, it'd be more hygienic

20
00:01:08,713 --> 00:01:11,703
if they had a plague-infested gibbon
sneeze my hands dry.

21
00:01:12,494 --> 00:01:15,135
Hey, guys, I just got
the most amazing news...

22
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:21,584
Do you think you'll ever be able to talk
in front of me without being drunk?

23
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:25,823
Okay, I'll just,

24
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,401
go eat by myself.

25
00:01:27,585 --> 00:01:28,883
You don't have to do that.

26
00:01:29,076 --> 00:01:32,095
It's okay, between him not talking,
him talking and him...

27
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:36,536
I'm better off alone.

28
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:39,435
Good-bye, you poor,
strange little man.

29
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:45,976
She's so considerate.

30
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,516
What's your news?

31
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:50,379
Remember that little planetary object
I spotted beyond the Kuiper Belt?

32
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:52,678
Oh, yeah, 2008-NQ Sub-17.

33
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:55,087
Or as I call it, Planet Bollywood.

34
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:59,011
Anyway, because of my discovery,
<i>People magazine </i>is naming me

35
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:00,999
one of their 30 under 30 to watch.

36
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,834
Congratulations.

37
00:02:02,994 --> 00:02:04,458
That's incredible.

38
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:05,578
Excuse me,

39
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:08,648
30 what under 30 what
to watch what?

40
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,479
30 visionaries under 30 years of age

41
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,883
to watch as they challenge
the preconceptions of their fields.

42
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:19,510
If I had a million guesses,
I never would have gotten that.

43
00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:23,777
They've got me in with a guy who's doing
something about hunger in Indonesia,

44
00:02:23,897 --> 00:02:26,862
and a psychotherapist who's using
dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners,

45
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:28,312
and Ellen Page,

46
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:30,909
star of the charming
independent film, <i>Juno</i>.

47
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,806
I'd so do her.

48
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:37,991
You'd do the dolphins.

49
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:41,289
Do I get an honorable
mention for designing

50
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,416
the telescope camera
mounting bracket you used?

51
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:46,628
Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming
and personal narrative

52
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:48,963
in which a humble boy from New Delhi

53
00:02:49,123 --> 00:02:50,754
overcame poverty and prejudice

54
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:53,525
and journeyed to America
to reach for the stars.

55
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:55,729
Poverty?
Your father's a gynecologist.

56
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,256
He drives a Bentley.

57
00:02:58,529 --> 00:02:59,641
It's a lease.

58
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,261
I'm confused.

59
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:06,979
Was there some sort
of peer review committee

60
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,275
to determine which scientists
would be included?

61
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:11,431
Peer review?
It's <i>People magazine</i>.

62
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:12,837
<i>People</i> picked me.

63
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:16,581
- What people?
- The people from <i>People</i>.

64
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,517
But exactly who are these people?
What are their credentials?

65
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:22,059
How are they qualified?

66
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:24,714
What makes accidentally
noticing a hunk of rock

67
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,855
that's been traipsing around
the solar system for billions of years

68
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:30,825
more noteworthy than any other
scientific accomplishment

69
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,382
made by someone under 30?

70
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:36,302
Boy, I'll bet Ellen Page's friends
aren't giving her this kind of crap.

71
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:43,698
Are you proud of yourself?

72
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:45,521
In general, yes.

73
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:06,040
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

74
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:16,383
There's my missing neutrino.

75
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,289
You were hiding from me
as an unbalanced charge,

76
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:21,886
weren't you,
you little sub-atomic dickens?

77
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,767
Hey, look,
I found my missing neutrino.

78
00:04:26,188 --> 00:04:28,563
Oh good, we can take it
off the milk carton.

79
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:32,989
We're going to apologize to Raj
and invite him out to dinner.

80
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:34,610
Apologize for what?

81
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,282
He came over last night
with some pretty good news

82
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,989
and we weren't very supportive.

83
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:42,534
I sense you're trying
to tell me something.

84
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:45,235
You were a colossal asshat.

85
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,590
No, I beg to differ.

86
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:52,628
Of the three of us, I was by far
the most supportive.

87
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:54,371
Really? Do tell.

88
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:58,301
How will Raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him?

89
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,135
When I was 11,

90
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:03,252
my sister bought our father
a "World's Greatest Dad" coffee mug

91
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:06,259
and, frankly, the man coasted
until the day he died.

92
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:09,549
Okay, let's try it this way.

93
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:12,689
What if this <i>People magazine</i> thing
is the best he's ever gonna achieve?

94
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:15,859
I had not considered that.

95
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:17,402
Come on.

96
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:20,664
I often forget
other people have limitations.

97
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:22,128
It's so sad.

98
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:25,827
- He can feel sadness?
- Not really.

99
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:28,039
It's what you and I
would call condescension.

100
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:33,069
Now when we go in there,
let's show Raj that we're happy for him.

101
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:34,281
But I'm not.

102
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:37,673
Well, then fake it.

103
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:40,079
Look at me.
I could be grinding on the fact

104
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,401
that without my stabilizing
telescope mount

105
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:46,391
he never would have found that stupid,
little clump of cosmic schmutz.

106
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:50,060
But I'm bigger than that.

107
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:52,187
Fine.
What do you want me to do?

108
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:54,065
Smile.

109
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,838
Crap, that's terrifying.

110
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:09,414
We're here to see Koothrappali,
not kill Batman.

111
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,334
Try less teeth.

112
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,421
Close enough.
Come on.

113
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:24,928
- Hey, Raj.
- Hey, guys. What's up?

114
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:27,222
We just wanted
to invite you out to dinner.

115
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,861
To celebrate your
"30 under 30" thing.

116
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:31,138
Right, Sheldon?

117
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:37,190
That's very nice of you.
I would like that.

118
00:06:37,352 --> 00:06:39,016
Hello, boys.
Dr. Gablehauser.

119
00:06:39,136 --> 00:06:40,756
- Dr. Koothrappali.
- Dr. Gablehauser.

120
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:42,505
- Dr. Hofstader.
- Dr. Gablehauser.

121
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,072
- Dr. Cooper.
- Dr. Gablehauser.

122
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:45,387
Mr. Wolowitz.

123
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:49,828
Boys, I've got a question for you:
Who in this room

124
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,391
discovered a star?

125
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,167
Actually, 2008-NQ Sub-17
is a planetary body.

126
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:56,850
I'm not talking about you,
I'm talking about me.

127
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,203
You, my exotic young friend,

128
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:00,815
are my star.

129
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,780
But you didn't discover him.
You merely noticed he was here,

130
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,596
much like he did
with 2008-NQ Sub-17.

131
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:09,766
Sorry.

132
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:15,177
Boy, we've got to get you
into a better office.

133
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:17,105
Something more suited
to your status.

134
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:18,855
You don't have to go to any trouble.

135
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:20,777
How about Von Gerlich's old office?

136
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:23,264
I'd rather have Fishbein's.
It's bigger.

137
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,214
Wait a minute,
I called dibs on Fishbein's office

138
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:29,282
the day he started showing up
at work in his bathrobe.

139
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:33,288
He gets a new office, I can't even get
paper towels in the men's room?

140
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:35,001
Damn, this is hard.

141
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:43,769
Let me ask you something.

142
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,605
What do you think
the business of this place is?

143
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:53,268
- Science?
- Money.

144
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:54,394
Told you.

145
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:58,200
And this boy's picture
in <i>People magazine</i>

146
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,483
is gonna raise us a pile
of money taller than...

147
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:02,984
well, taller than you.

148
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:06,446
I have a Master's degree.

149
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:07,870
Who doesn't?

150
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:13,050
Have you ever had lunch
in the president's dining room?

151
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,674
I didn't even know there was
a president's dining room.

152
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:18,403
It's the same food
as the cafeteria, only fresh.

153
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,545
- Come on, little buddy.
- Okay, big buddy.

154
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,695
See you tonight, guys.

155
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,350
You can stop smiling now.

156
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,002
So anyway, after a fantastic lunch,

157
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:35,657
I was whisked off
to the <i>People magazine</i> photo shoot...

158
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:38,183
Have any of you boys
ever been to a photo shoot?

159
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:39,771
It's fantastic.

160
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:42,772
Apparently,
the camera loves me and I, it.

161
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:48,670
They shot me in front of a starry
background where I posed like this.

162
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:56,758
They're going to digitally add
a supernova.

163
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:59,542
They say it's the perfect metaphor
for my incandescent talent.

164
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,897
Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas
that collapses upon itself.

165
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:08,752
Excuse me.
Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor.

166
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,250
Go for Koothrappali.

167
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:12,763
They gave him an assistant?

168
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:16,275
If I want a new pen, I have to go
to the bank with wire cutters.

169
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:19,676
Have we at this point
met our social obligations?

170
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:20,687
Not yet.

171
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:22,442
Okay, just put it on my calendar,

172
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,569
but start thinking of a reason
why I can't go.

173
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,533
All righty?
Koothrappali out.

174
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:29,889
God bless that boy.
I don't know what I'd do without him.

175
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:31,656
You just got him this afternoon.

176
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:34,730
Yes, but I'm finding
that having a lackey suits me.

177
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:36,911
A lackey?

178
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:38,737
I'm sorry.
Is that politically incorrect?

179
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:41,244
In India, we just call them
untouchables.

180
00:09:42,234 --> 00:09:43,783
- Now?
- Almost.

181
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:47,846
Speaking of untouchables,
I've got great news for you guys.

182
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:51,426
<i>People magazine</i> is having
a reception this Saturday

183
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:53,221
and I managed to get you invited.

184
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:55,847
- Gee, thanks.
- You're welcome.

185
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,661
Of course, I couldn't get you
into the VIP section

186
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:00,406
because, you know, that's for VIPs

187
00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:02,788
and you guys are just,
you know... P's.

188
00:10:05,284 --> 00:10:07,498
There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea

189
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:09,804
where, when a hunter
flaunts his success

190
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:12,149
to the rest of the village,
they kill him

191
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:15,302
and drive away evil spirits
with a drum made of his skin.

192
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:16,993
Superstious nonsense, of course,

193
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:19,060
but one can see their point.

194
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:29,673
Here you go, Raj.
You might want to drink this one slowly.

195
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:32,802
So, Saturday night,
can I count on my posse?

196
00:10:33,337 --> 00:10:36,179
Gee, I'd love to, Raj,
but I can't make it.

197
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:41,923
No, I could...

198
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:47,355
I can make it. But I won't.

199
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:49,871
What are you talking about?

200
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:52,606
There's a reception
for my magazine article on Saturday.

201
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:54,235
And you guys aren't going?

202
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:57,813
I can't believe you. Raj is celebrating
a tremendous accomplishment

203
00:10:57,933 --> 00:11:00,007
and you're not even going
to support him?

204
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:03,337
A tremendous accomplishment would be
if the planetary body he discovered

205
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:06,544
were plummeting toward Earth
and he exploded it with his mind.

206
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:10,764
That would be cool.
I'd go to that reception.

207
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:14,504
Come on, this is huge.
Raj is gonna be in <i>People magazine</i>,

208
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:17,847
and he didn't even have to knock up
one of the Spears sisters.

209
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,608
Would you like to go with me?

210
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:23,059
Of course I would.
I would be honored.

211
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,604
Really? Cool.

212
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:26,636
Shame on you guys.

213
00:11:29,883 --> 00:11:32,119
Look at that,
I got a date with Penny.

214
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:35,113
I can't believe
it took you a whole year.

215
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:38,407
- Now?
- Now.

216
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,336
Hey, buddy,

217
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,335
I'm going to be
in <i>People magazine</i>.

218
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:49,736
Yeah, call me
when you're on the cover.

219
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,484
Raj, look at you!

220
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:06,988
I know. I'm resplendent
like the noonday sun, am I not?

221
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:12,317
Yeah. Starting with the champagne
a little early, aren't you?

222
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:14,860
It was in the limo.
They sent a limo.

223
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,347
I have a limo.
I just love saying "limo."

224
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:21,160
- Sip on it while you're getting ready.
- I'm ready.

225
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:23,829
That's what you're wearing?

226
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,583
Why, what's wrong with it?

227
00:12:28,137 --> 00:12:31,099
Nothing. I was just hoping
for something a little more, you know,

228
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,688
ridonkulous.

229
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:43,251
Yeah. Well, this is all the donkulous
you're gonna get tonight.

230
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:46,472
Okey-dokey, let's roll.

231
00:12:47,424 --> 00:12:49,814
All right, it's time
to raise the roof!

232
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:53,691
- Hey, Leonard.
- Dude.

233
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,296
You look very nice.

234
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,572
Thank you.

235
00:12:59,457 --> 00:13:01,400
- Come on. Good night.
- Good night.

236
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,993
Hey, Leonard, do you
see my limo downstairs?

237
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:07,705
It's bigger than the house
my grandfather grew up in.

238
00:13:08,303 --> 00:13:10,418
- Terrific.
- It has more food, too.

239
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:12,384
Come on. Come on.

240
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:27,392
Good news. You don't have to sulk
about Penny anymore.

241
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:31,223
There are hundreds of Croatian women
just waiting for you to contact them.

242
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:34,832
Anything-for-a-greencard.com?

243
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,659
I'll lend you my user name.
It's "Wealthy Big Penis."

244
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:43,770
You're joking.

245
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,854
You gotta make it easy for 'em.
They're just learning English.

246
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,463
Pass.

247
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,584
So you're just gonna
sit around here and mope

248
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:54,866
while Penny is out with Dr. Apu
from the Kwik-E Mart?

249
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:58,674
It's not a date,
and that's racist.

250
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:00,092
It can't be racist.

251
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,392
He's a beloved character
on <i>The Simpsons</i>.

252
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:06,246
Let's just eat
so I can get to bed.

253
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:09,665
With any luck, tonight will be the night
my sleep apnea kills me.

254
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:16,967
Did you ask for the chicken
with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?

255
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,174
Even though the menu description
specifies "shredded"?

256
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:20,749
Brown rice, not white?

257
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:23,298
Did you stop at the Korean grocery
and get the good hot mustard?

258
00:14:23,418 --> 00:14:25,594
Did you pick up the low sodium
soy sauce from the market?

259
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:27,536
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

260
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,591
What took you so long?

261
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,337
- Just sit down and eat.
- Fine.

262
00:14:38,123 --> 00:14:40,716
All right, it's shredded.
What do you want me to do?

263
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,329
I want you to check
before you accept the order.

264
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,449
Sorry.

265
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:48,192
Were you distracted by the possibility
that Koothrappali

266
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:50,475
might have intercourse
with Penny tonight?

267
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:55,337
He's not going to have
intercourse with Penny.

268
00:14:55,457 --> 00:14:57,781
Then there's no excuse
for this chicken.

269
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:01,914
You know, this situation
with Koothrappali

270
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,323
brings to mind
a story from my childhood.

271
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:07,340
Oh, goody, more tales
from the panhandle.

272
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,034
That's northwest Texas.
I'm from east Texas,

273
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:13,167
the Gulf region,
home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.

274
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:16,335
Do the shrimpers feature
in your story?

275
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:22,027
Anyway,
when I was eight,

276
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:26,238
a Montgomery Ward delivery van
ran over our family cat Lucky.

277
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,182
- Lucky?
- Yes, Lucky.

278
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:32,819
He's irony-impaired.
Just move on.

279
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,857
Dead cat named Lucky.
Continue.

280
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,733
While others mourned Lucky,

281
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:40,778
I realized his untimely demise

282
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,178
provided me with the opportunity
to replace him

283
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:45,363
with something more suited
to my pet needs:

284
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:48,683
a faithful companion
that I could snuggle with at night,

285
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:52,138
yet would be capable of killing
upon telepathic command.

286
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:55,795
So not a puppy?

287
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,419
Please, nothing so pedestrian.

288
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:00,595
I wanted a griffin.

289
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:03,503
A griffin?

290
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:05,883
Yes, half eagle, half lion.

291
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:08,442
And mythological.

292
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:11,222
Irrelevant.

293
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:15,019
I was studying
recombinant DNA technology,

294
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:18,153
and I was confidant I could create one,
but my parents were unwilling

295
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:20,970
to secure the necessary
eagle eggs and lion semen.

296
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:26,715
Of course, my sister got swimming
lessons when she wanted them.

297
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:33,260
Not that we don't all enjoy
a good lion semen story,

298
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:37,536
- but what's your point?
- My point is

299
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:39,295
if Koothrappali is moving on

300
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,510
to a new life
of shallow undeserved fame,

301
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,590
perhaps this is an opportunity
to create a better cohort.

302
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:48,182
You want to breed a new friend?

303
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,846
That's one option,
but who has the time?

304
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:55,601
But consider this--
the Japanese are doing

305
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:57,883
some wonderful work
with artificial intelligence.

306
00:16:58,003 --> 00:17:00,390
Now, you combine that
with some animatronics

307
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,216
from the imagineers over at Disney,

308
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:04,131
next thing you know,
we're playing Halo

309
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:06,096
with a multilingual Abraham Lincoln.

310
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:10,417
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're insane.

311
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,794
That may well be, but the fact is

312
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:15,953
it wouldn't kill us
to meet some new people.

313
00:17:16,116 --> 00:17:19,041
For the record, it could kill us
to meet new people.

314
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,514
They could be murderers
or the carriers of unusual pathogens.

315
00:17:25,374 --> 00:17:27,871
And I'm not insane.
My mother had me tested.

316
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,889
If we do get a new friend,
he should be a guy you can trust.

317
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:38,070
- A guy who has your back.
- And he should have a lot of money

318
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,313
and live in a cool place by the beach
where we could throw parties.

319
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:44,828
- And share our love of technology.
- And he should know a lot of women.

320
00:17:45,694 --> 00:17:47,959
Let's see, money,
women, technology.

321
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,490
Okay, we're agreed.
Our new friend is going to be Iron Man.

322
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,236
Welcome to the Raj Mahal.

323
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:05,087
It's very nice.
Good night.

324
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:07,296
- Wait. The evening's not over.
- Yes, it is.

325
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,599
No, it's time to put on some R. Kelly
and suck face.

326
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:14,471
Is the evening over?

327
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,037
Wait, wait, wait!

328
00:18:16,157 --> 00:18:18,243
That's my mommy and daddy
calling from India.

329
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,228
- I want you to meet my parents.
- Wait. Meet them?

330
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,025
Hello, Mommy, Daddy.
Good to see you.

331
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:27,980
How are you?
I'm not drunk.

332
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:32,312
- <i>Why would you say that?</i>
- Just making conversation.

333
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:35,534
Mommy, Daddy, I want you
to meet my new squeeze, Penny.

334
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:38,239
I'm not your squeeze.
There is no squeezing.

335
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:41,290
<i>I can't see her.
Center her in the frame.</i>

336
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,195
Here you go. Cute, huh?

337
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:45,984
<i>She's not Indian.</i>

338
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:49,410
<i>So she's not Indian.
The boy is just sowing some wild oats.</i>

339
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:52,592
There's no sowing, no squeezing
and no sucking face.

340
00:18:54,073 --> 00:18:55,533
<i>What if he gets her pregnant?</i>

341
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:58,931
<i>Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want
as the mother of your grandchildren?</i>

342
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,144
What right do you have to pick
with whom I can have children with?

343
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:04,675
<i>Look, Rajesh, I understand,
you're in America.</i>

344
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:06,769
<i>You want to try
the "local cuisine."</i>

345
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,875
<i>Trust me.
You don't want it for a steady diet.</i>

346
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:14,240
Now you listen to me.
I am no longer a child

347
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,353
and I will not be
spoken to like one.

348
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,952
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go throw up.

349
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,832
- <i>What's wrong with him?</i>
- I don't know.

350
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:25,882
Maybe it's the local cuisine.

351
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:34,135
Well, it's nice to meet you.

352
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:37,221
I'm just gonna
set you on down over here.

353
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:39,264
And I'm gonna leave, so...

354
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,570
<i>namaste.</i>

355
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:47,218
And FYI, you'd be lucky
to have me as a daughter-in-law.

356
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:51,129
She's feisty.

357
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:52,904
I like that.

358
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:05,435
Raj, what are you doing?

359
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:11,755
No notes. If you have
something to say to me, say it.

360
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:28,266
Sorry.

361
00:20:30,977 --> 00:20:32,734
Sweetie, it's okay.
