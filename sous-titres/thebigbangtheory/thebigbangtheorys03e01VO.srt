<i>Previously on </i>The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,542
I am going to the Arctic Circle
with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.

3
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:07,634
- For three months?
- Yes.

4
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:11,036
What did you mean when you said
you were going to miss me?

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,465
It means I wish you weren't going.

6
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,405
Thank God we're home.

7
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:35,205
I can't believe we spent three months
in that frozen hell.

8
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:39,246
It was like a snowy nightmare
from which there was no awakening.

9
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,292
I don't know what Arctic expedition
you guys were on,

10
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,502
but I thought it was
a hoot and a half.

11
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:48,919
Hi, Mom.

12
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,094
I told you I'd call you when I got home.
I'm not home yet.

13
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:56,114
All right, I'm home.

14
00:00:57,454 --> 00:01:00,242
The Arctic expedition
was a remarkable success.

15
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:02,757
I'm all but certain
there's a Nobel Prize in my future.

16
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:05,606
Actually, I shouldn't say that.
I'm entirely certain.

17
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:11,070
No, Mother, I could not feel
your church group praying for my safety.

18
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,419
The fact that I'm home safe
doesn't prove it worked.

19
00:01:14,544 --> 00:01:16,605
That logic is post hoc
ergo propter hoc.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,202
No, I'm not sassing you
in Eskimo talk.

21
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
I'm gonna let Penny know we're back.

22
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:27,345
Mother, I have to go.
Love you. Bye.

23
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,748
Hello, old friend.

24
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:41,011
Daddy's home.

25
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:45,563
Leonard, you're back.

26
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,439
I just stopped by to say...

27
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:54,029
So, hi.

28
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,791
Damn it, I should have gone over
and told her we were back.

29
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:14,137
Yeah, it was
first-come, first-serve.

33
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:42,119
I just want you both to know,

34
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,498
when I publish my findings,
I won't forget your contributions.

35
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:47,224
- Great.
- Thanks.

36
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,917
Of course, I can't mention you
in my Nobel acceptance speech,

37
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:51,845
but when I get around
to writing my memoirs,

38
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,389
you can expect a very effusive footnote
and perhaps a signed copy.

39
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:58,302
We have to tell him.

40
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,522
Tell me what?

41
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,510
Damn his Vulcan hearing.

42
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:06,352
You fellows are planning a party
for me, aren't you?

43
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:08,979
Okay, Sheldon, sit down.

44
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:12,415
If there's going to be a theme,
I should let you know

45
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,944
that I don't care for luau, toga
or "under the sea."

46
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:19,365
Yeah, we'll keep that in mind.
Look...

47
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:23,541
We need to talk to you about something
that happened at the North Pole.

48
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:26,028
If this is about the night
the heat went out,

49
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:28,559
there's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

50
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:33,031
- It's not about that.
- We agreed to never speak of it again.

51
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,297
So we slept together naked.

52
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:41,178
It was only to keep our core body
temperatures from plummeting.

53
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:44,268
He's speaking about it.

54
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,065
For me, it was a bonding moment.

55
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:54,024
Sheldon, you remember
the first few weeks

56
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,227
we were looking
for magnetic monopoles

57
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:57,766
and not finding anything

58
00:03:57,891 --> 00:04:01,372
and you were acting
like an obnoxious, giant dictator?

59
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:03,409
We were gonna be gentle with him.

60
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:05,877
That's why I added the "tator."

61
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,916
And when we finally
got our first positive data,

62
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,378
you were so happy.

63
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,608
In the world of emoticons,
I was colon, capital "D."

64
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:28,169
Well, in actuality,
what your equipment detected

65
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:32,037
wasn't so much evidence
of paradigm-shifting monopoles

66
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,297
as it was...

67
00:04:34,355 --> 00:04:37,484
static from the electric can opener
we were turning on and off.

68
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,995
He just went colon, capital "O."

69
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,828
- You tampered with my experiment?
- We had to.

70
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,441
It was the only way to keep you
from being such a huge Dickensian.

71
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,089
You see that? I add the "ensian. "

72
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,730
Did Leonard know about this?

73
00:04:58,855 --> 00:05:01,545
Leonard's my best friend in the world.
Surely Leonard didn't know.

74
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,801
It was his idea.

75
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,428
Of course it was.
The whole plan reeks of Leonard.

76
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,043
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you, too.

77
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:11,199
I couldn't think of anyone else
while you were gone.

78
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:12,324
Me, neither.

79
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:16,342
Except for one night
when the heat went out.

80
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:19,471
Long story. Don't ask.

81
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:29,021
Do not make a sound.

82
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:32,576
Whispering,
"Do not make a sound... "

83
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:35,276
is a sound.

84
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:39,207
Damn his Vulcan hearing.

85
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:42,024
Not a good time, Sheldon.

86
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,763
Oh, this is ridiculous.

87
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,641
- What?
- Hello.

88
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,812
I realize you're currently at the mercy
of your primitive biological urges,

89
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,553
but as you have an entire lifetime
of poor decisions ahead of you,

90
00:05:57,678 --> 00:05:59,314
may I interrupt this one?

91
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:02,403
It's great to see you too.
Come on in.

92
00:06:03,398 --> 00:06:06,480
Wolowitz has informed me
of your grand deception.

93
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,450
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

94
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,813
Yes, I feel terrible about it.

95
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:13,573
I will never forgive myself,
I don't expect you to, either,

96
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:16,108
and I would really appreciate it
if you would leave me with Penny

97
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,780
for a session of self-criticism
and repentance.

98
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:24,883
Can someone please tell me
what's going on here?

99
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:27,316
What's going on is
I was led to believe

100
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:29,596
I was making
groundbreaking strides in science,

101
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,015
when in fact, I was being

102
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,767
fed false data at the hands
of Wolowitz, Koothrappali

103
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:35,872
and your furry little boy toy.

104
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:39,189
Is that true?

105
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,859
It was the only way
to make him happy.

106
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,360
Make him happy?

107
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,863
When he wasn't happy,
we wanted to kill him.

108
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,141
There was even a plan.

109
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,745
We were going to throw
his Kindle outside,

110
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,455
when he went to get it, lock the door

111
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,165
and let him freeze to death.

112
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,625
That seems like a bit
of an overreaction.

113
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,189
The overreaction
was the plan to tie your limbs

114
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:04,715
to four different sled dog teams
and yell, "Mush. "

115
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:09,250
We kept the original data.

116
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,484
You can still publish
the actual results.

117
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,641
Yes, but the actual results
are unsuccessful

118
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,484
and I've already sent an e-mail
to everyone at the university

119
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:19,464
explaining that I have
confirmed string theory

120
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,940
and forever changed
man's understanding of the universe.

121
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,503
Aw, see, yeah, you probably
shouldn't have done that.

122
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:29,323
So write another e-mail.
Set the record straight. No big deal.

123
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:32,743
You're right, Leonard.

124
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,412
It's not a big deal.

125
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:37,245
All you did was lie to me,
destroy my dream

126
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,420
and humiliate me
in front of the whole university.

127
00:07:42,457 --> 00:07:44,815
That, FYI, was sarcasm.

128
00:07:46,547 --> 00:07:48,947
I, in fact,
believe it is a big deal.

129
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:52,548
The poor thing.

130
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,765
- Yeah, I feel terrible.
- Wait. Wait.

131
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:57,059
Aren't you going to go talk to him?

132
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,270
He'll be fine. The guy's a trouper.
Come here.

133
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:03,797
You're right, you shouldn't talk to him.
I will.

134
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,263
Man, I cannot catch a break.

135
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:18,609
Do you want to talk?

136
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,790
About what?

137
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:22,251
Being betrayed by my friends?

138
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:25,179
Spending three months
at the North Pole for nothing?

139
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:29,652
And I didn't even get
to go to Comic-Con!

140
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:33,678
Oh, hon...

141
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:43,564
<i>Soft kitty, warm kitty</i>

142
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,233
That's for when I'm sick.
Sad is not sick.

143
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:48,944
Sorry.
I don't know your sad song.

144
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,350
I don't have a sad song.
I'm not a child.

145
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:56,902
You know, I do understand
what you're going through.

146
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:57,828
Really?

147
00:08:58,157 --> 00:09:01,228
Did you just have the Nobel Prize
in waitressing stolen from you?

148
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:06,055
Well, no, but when I was a senior
in high school,

149
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,881
one of my friends heard
I was gonna be named head cheerleader.

150
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:10,275
I was so excited.

151
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,819
My mom even made me
a celebration pie.

152
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,307
Then they named stupid
Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader.

153
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,732
Big ol' slutbag.

154
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:20,942
Are you saying

155
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,187
that you think a "celebration pie"

156
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,467
is even remotely
comparable to a Nobel Prize?

157
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:28,999
They're pretty tasty.

158
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:34,276
And on a different,
but not unrelated topic,

159
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:37,152
based on your current efforts
to buoy my spirits,

160
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,214
do you truly believe
that you were ever fit

161
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,305
to be a cheerleader?

162
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:49,712
Look, Sheldon, I just don't think
that the guys and Leonard

163
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:51,705
really meant to hurt you.

164
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,302
They just told an unfortunate lie
to deal with a difficult situation.

165
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:56,887
You know what it's like?

166
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,246
Remember that scene in the new Star Trek
when Kirk has to take over the ship,

167
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:02,562
so he tells Spock all that stuff
he knew wasn't true,

168
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:05,387
like saying
Spock didn't care his mom died?

169
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:08,732
I missed Comic-Con
and the New Star Trek movie!

170
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:15,773
- I like the new look.
- Thanks.

171
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:21,245
I call it "the Clooney."

172
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:25,415
I call it "the Mario and Luigi,"
but whatever.

173
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:29,002
How's Sheldon doing?

174
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:31,930
He came out of his room this morning
wearing his Darth Vader helmet

175
00:10:32,055 --> 00:10:33,947
and tried to choke me to death
with the force,

176
00:10:34,072 --> 00:10:35,943
so I'd say, "a little better."

177
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:41,098
If I may abruptly change the subject,
did you and Penny finally... You know.

178
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:44,652
Personally, I don't care,
but my genitals wanted me to ask.

179
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:48,897
Tell your genitals what I do with Penny
is none of their business.

180
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,082
He says they didn't do it.

181
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,520
Sheldon, over here.

182
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:11,461
What are you doing?

183
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:14,401
I feel bad for the guy.

184
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:19,803
Sheldon, why are you
sitting by yourself?

185
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,690
Because I am without friends.

186
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:24,691
Like the proverbial cheese,
I stand alone.

187
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,870
Even while seated.

188
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:29,159
Come on. We said we were sorry.

189
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:31,094
It's going to take more
than an "I'm sorry"

190
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:33,157
and a store-bought
apology pie from Penny

191
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:35,485
to make up
for what you've done to me.

192
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:38,204
Read your retraction email.

193
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:40,452
Way to destroy your reputation.

194
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:42,462
You see?

195
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:45,162
People have been pointing
and laughing at me all morning.

196
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,630
That's not true.

197
00:11:47,098 --> 00:11:49,541
People have been pointing
and laughing at you your whole life.

198
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:51,460
I've had enough.

199
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,836
Attention, everyone.

200
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:54,671
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

201
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,408
As many of you
in the physics department might know,

202
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,974
my career trajectory
has taken a minor detour.

203
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:01,199
Off a cliff.

204
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:05,312
My credibility
may have been damaged...

205
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:06,525
Completely wrecked.

206
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,669
But I would like to remind you
that in science,

207
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:11,313
there's no such thing as failure.

208
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,023
There once was a man

209
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,932
who referred to his prediction
of a cosmological constant

210
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:18,725
as the single "biggest blunder"
of his career.

211
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,698
That man's name was...
surprise, surprise...

212
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:23,033
Albert Einstein.

213
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:26,876
Yeah, but research into dark energy

214
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:28,850
proved that Einstein's
cosmological constant

215
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:31,596
was actually right all along,
so you're still...

216
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:33,213
surprise, surprise...

217
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:34,338
A loser.

218
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:39,223
You think you're so clever.

219
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:40,463
Let me just tell you,

220
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:42,817
while I do not currently
have a scathing retort,

221
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:45,499
you check your e-mail
periodically for a doozy.

222
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:53,063
So much for our friendship
with Sheldon.

223
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:56,900
We'll always have the night
the heat went out.

224
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:07,177
Since we got interrupted last night,

225
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:09,246
I didn't have a chance
to give you this.

226
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:11,976
You shouldn't have.

227
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:15,348
Oh, boy!

228
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,650
What is it?

229
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:20,838
It's a snowflake.

230
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:22,259
From the North Pole.

231
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:24,846
Are you serious?

232
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,687
It's eternal.

233
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:29,852
I preserved it in a one percent solution
of polyvinyl acetal resin.

234
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,339
That's the most romantic thing
anyone's ever said to me

235
00:13:37,464 --> 00:13:38,929
that I didn't understand.

236
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:42,093
It's actually a simple process.

237
00:13:42,218 --> 00:13:45,154
Cyanoacrylates are monomers
which polymerize on...

238
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,204
Red alert, Leonard.
Sheldon ran away.

239
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,944
Man, I cannot catch a break.

240
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:56,168
So, how do you know he ran away?

241
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,994
Well, he's not answering his phone,

242
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:00,294
he handed in his
resignation at the university

243
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:03,467
and he sent me a text
that said, "I'm running away."

244
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,869
Thanks for letting me know.

245
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:07,762
Aren't you going to do something?

246
00:14:08,402 --> 00:14:10,807
Of course I'm going to do something.

247
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:14,433
Howard, you check the comic book store.
Raj, go to the thai restaurant.

248
00:14:14,558 --> 00:14:16,726
I'll stay here with Penny
in her apartment.

249
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:19,721
Oh, damn it.

250
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:22,110
It's Sheldon's mother.

251
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:24,129
A break cannot be caught.

252
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:26,406
Hi, Mrs. Cooper.

253
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,640
He is?
Sheldon went home to Texas.

254
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,109
Yeah, no, I know he resigned.

255
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:37,128
I guess it kind of is our fault.

256
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,825
No, you're right.
Someone needs to come talk to him.

257
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,794
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

258
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:44,749
All right.

259
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:47,116
New plan.

260
00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:50,523
Howard, you and Raj go to Texas.
I'll stay with Penny in her apartment.

261
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,099
You're not gonna go with them?

262
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,782
Well, you know,
I gave you the snowflake

263
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,181
and we were kissing and...

264
00:14:57,306 --> 00:14:59,272
Come on,
I don't want to go to Texas!

265
00:15:00,502 --> 00:15:03,202
Oh, right, and I do?
My people already crossed a desert once.

266
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:04,377
We're done.

267
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:09,741
Trust me, you'll be fine. See ya.

268
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:11,737
Well, wait a second, Leonard.

269
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:14,166
Come on, how can you not go?
He's your best friend.

270
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,686
Yeah, but I already saw him naked.
Just come here.

271
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:20,186
I promise I will be here
when you get back.

272
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:21,795
Just go help Sheldon.

273
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:23,750
- Really?
- Yeah.

274
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,445
We waited a few months.
We can wait a few more days.

275
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,700
Maybe you can.

276
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:36,215
Go.

277
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,960
Boy, you cannot
catch a break, can you?

278
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:46,157
Here you go, Shelly.

279
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:47,681
Thanks, Mom.

280
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:51,685
Hold your horses, young man.

281
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,743
Here in Texas,
we pray before we eat.

282
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:54,982
Aw, Mom.

283
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:57,857
This is not California,
land of the heathen.

284
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,625
Gimme.

285
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:07,109
By His hand we are all...

286
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,375
... fed.

287
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:11,367
Give us, Lord, our daily...

288
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:13,123
... bread.

289
00:16:13,328 --> 00:16:15,654
- Please know that we are truly...
- ... grateful.

290
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,413
- For every cup and every...
- ... plateful.

291
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:24,691
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?

292
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,091
My objection was based
on considerations

293
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:28,816
other than difficulty.

294
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,666
Whatever.
Jesus still loves you.

295
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:37,478
Thank you for carving a smiley face
in my grilled cheese sandwich.

296
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:39,589
Oh, I know
how to take care of my baby.

297
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:43,622
His eyes came out a little thin,
but you can just pretend he's Chinese.

298
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:50,841
So, do you want to talk about

299
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:53,553
what happened with you
and your little friends?

300
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:56,473
- They're not my friends.
- All right.

301
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,210
If you recall, when you were little,

302
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:03,229
we sat right here at this very spot

303
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,878
and we talked about the problems

304
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,275
you had getting along
with the neighbor kids.

305
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,527
That was different.

306
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,307
They were threatened
by my intelligence

307
00:17:10,432 --> 00:17:12,985
and too stupid to know
that's why they hated me.

308
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:18,294
Oh baby, they knew very well
why they hated you.

309
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,550
I can't believe
you bought a red cowboy hat.

310
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:35,175
Hello?
I'm wearing a red turtleneck.

311
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:42,040
Plus, it was the only boys' large
they had.

312
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:46,619
I'm sorry,
this does not look like Texas.

313
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:48,901
Where's the tumbleweeds?
Whe's the saloons?

314
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,026
Saloons?

315
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,011
Like in the movies
I saw growing up in India.

316
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:55,014
You know, <i>Four for Texas</i>,
<i>Yellow Rose of Texas.</i>

317
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:58,465
This neighborhood is more
<i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>.

318
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:02,163
I was really hoping
to see a cattle drive.

319
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,455
What can I tell you?

320
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:06,789
They probably have steaks on sale
at that big-ass Costco over there.

321
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:18,766
Will you please
take that stupid hat off?

322
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,640
No, I want to blend in.

323
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,215
To what? <i>Toy Story?</i>

324
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,149
- Hi, boys.
- Howdy, ma'am.

325
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,601
Howdy to you, too.
You got here quick.

326
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:33,653
- We took the red-eye.
- Well, come on in.

327
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,171
Thank you kindly.

328
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,507
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, thank you.

329
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:41,999
If y'all don't mind,
I got a hankerin' for a Lone Star beer.

330
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:47,580
There's no alcohol in this household.
Stop talking like that and lose the hat.

331
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:52,854
Sorry. I'll take a diet Yoo-Hoo
if you have it.

332
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:56,101
You'll take a cola.

333
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:59,053
What about you?
Radge, isn't it?

334
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:01,761
You still having trouble
talking to the ladies?

335
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:03,962
Because, at our church,

336
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:06,306
we have a woman
who's an amazing healer.

337
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:09,132
Mostly she does
crutch and wheelchair people,

338
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:12,105
but I bet she'd be willing
to take a shot

339
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,278
at whatever Third World demon
is running around inside of you.

340
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:18,773
If you don't mind,

341
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:20,959
there's a 3:05 nonstop
back to Los Angeles

342
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:23,703
and you have no idea
how much I want to be on it.

343
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:26,661
- A girl?
- Uh, yes, ma'am.

344
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,485
Oh, good.
I been praying for you.

345
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:36,949
- What are they doing here?
- We came to apologize.

346
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:38,662
- Again.
- And bring you home.

347
00:19:38,787 --> 00:19:40,886
Why don't you pack up your stuff
and we'll head back?

348
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:44,242
No, this is my home now.

349
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:46,619
Thanks to you, my career is over

350
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:48,976
and I will spend
the rest of my life here in Texas

351
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:51,192
trying to teach evolution
to creationists.

352
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:56,820
You watch your mouth, Shelly.

353
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,739
Everyone's entitled
to their opinion.

354
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,408
Evolution isn't an opinion,
it's fact.

355
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:05,064
And that is your opinion.

356
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:10,701
I forgive you.
Let's go home.

357
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,581
Don't tell me prayer doesn't work.

358
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:26,983
How about that?
I finally caught a break.

359
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,539
You know how they say
when friends have sex,

360
00:20:35,664 --> 00:20:37,014
it can get weird?

361
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:38,348
Sure.

362
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:41,785
Why does it have to get weird?

363
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:43,688
I don't know.

364
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:45,412
I mean,

365
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,890
we were friends,
and now we're more than friends.

366
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:51,224
We're whatever "this" is.

367
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,734
But why label it, right?
I mean...

368
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:55,973
It is what it is and...

369
00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:58,298
- Leonard? It's weird.
- Totally.
