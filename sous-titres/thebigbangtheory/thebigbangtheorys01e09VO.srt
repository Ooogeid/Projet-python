1
00:00:00,529 --> 00:00:01,279
Ok...

2
00:00:03,147 --> 00:00:04,875
The X10's are online

3
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:11,220
Gentlemen, I am now about to send a
signal from this laptop through our
local ISP

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,373
racing down fibre optic cable at
the speed of light to San Fransisco,

5
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:18,546
bouncing off a satellite in
geosynchronous orbit to
Lisbon, Portugal,

6
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,576
where the data packets will be headed
off to submerge transatlantic cables,

7
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:23,292
terminating in Halifax,
Nova Scotia

8
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:26,697
and transfered across the continent
via microwave relays back to our ISP

9
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:30,024
And the extend receiver
attached to this...

10
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:31,860
Lamp.

11
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:36,895
Look at me, look at me.
I've got goosebumps.

12
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:39,809
- Are we ready for the stereo?
- Go for stereo.

13
00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:04,069
- Hey guys.
- Hello.

14
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,762
It's a little loud.

15
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:07,792
No problem... Turning it down.

16
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:12,291
San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax...
... et voil?

17
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:17,281
- OK, thanks.
- Hang on, hang on. Do you not
realise what we just did?

18
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,672
Yeah, you turned your stereo
down with your laptop.

19
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:24,563
No, we turned our stereo down, by
sending a signal around the world via
the Internet.

20
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:28,262
Oh. You know you can get one of those
universal remotes from Radioshack?

21
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,741
They're really cheap.

22
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:32,772
No, you don't get it. Howard,

23
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:36,032
- Enable public access.
- Public access enabled.

24
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:43,071
- Boy, that's terrific. I'll see ya.
- No hang on, hang on...

25
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:46,460
See?

26
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:48,731
No.

27
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:53,431
Someone in Sichuan province,
China, is using his computer

28
00:01:53,558 --> 00:01:55,061
to turn our lights on and off.

29
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:58,040
Oh, that's handy.

30
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:01,391
Here's a question... Why?

31
00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:04,960
Because we can.

32
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:08,651
They found our
remote control cars!

33
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,472
- Wait, what's on top of that?
- Wireless webcams, wave hello!

34
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:18,203
The monster truck is
out of Austin, Texas,

35
00:02:18,327 --> 00:02:21,893
and the blue Viper is being
operated from suburban Tel Aviv.

36
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:27,072
- You may want to put on slacks.
- What?

37
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:32,982
Ew, stop it! No!
Leave me alone!

38
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:39,151
- Who's running the red Corvette?
- That would be me.

39
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:46,273
<font color="#ffff00">-=www. Ydy.
com/bbs=- proudly presents</font>

40
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:05,691
You know in the future,
when we're disembodied brains in jars,

41
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:08,523
we're going to look at this
as eight hours well wasted.

42
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:13,720
I don't want to be in a jar.
I want my brain in an android body.

43
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:16,830
Eight feet tall and ribbed.

44
00:03:18,138 --> 00:03:19,241
I'm with you.

45
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,773
I just have to make sure if I'm a
synthetic human I'd still be Jewish.

46
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:26,010
I promised my mother.

47
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:31,813
I suppose you could have your
android penis circumcised.

48
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:37,072
But that's something your rabbi would
have to discuss with the manufacturer.

49
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:40,371
Not to mention you'd have
to power down on saturdays.

50
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:44,721
Sheldon, why is this
letter in the trash?

51
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:46,481
Well, there's always
the possibility that

52
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,411
a trash can spontaneously
formed around the letter

53
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:52,881
but Occam's rasor would suggest
that someone threw it out.

54
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:57,071
It's from the Institute of
Experimental Physics, they want us to

55
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,320
present our paper on the
properties of supersolids

56
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:02,313
at the topical conference of
Bose-Einstein condensates.

57
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:04,570
I know.
I read it before I threw it out.

58
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:08,491
Ok, if I may drill down to
the bedrock of my question:

59
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:09,911
why did you throw it out?

60
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:13,790
Because I have no interest in standing
in the Rose room of the
Pasadena Marriot,

61
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,081
in front of a group of
judgmental strangers

62
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:19,641
who wouldn't recognise true genius if it
was standing in front of them giving
a speech.

63
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:22,172
Which if I were there,
would be.

64
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:24,621
I don't know Sheldon.

65
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:28,002
Those topical conferences on
Bose-Einstein condensates' parties
are legendary

66
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:32,250
- Forget the parties!
- Forget the parties? What a nerd.

67
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,931
Are there any other honours I've
got that I don't know about?

68
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:39,861
Did the UPS dropped off a
Nobel prize with my name on it?

69
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,221
Leonard, please don't take this the
wrong way, but the day you win a
Nobel prize,

70
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:47,330
is the day I begin my research on the
drag coefficient of tassles on
flying carpets.

71
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:52,180
The only thing missing from
that insult was: "your mama".

72
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:54,961
I got one... Hey Leonard,

73
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:58,392
- Your mama's research methodology is so flawed...
- Shut up, Howard.

74
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:02,011
- Sheldon, we have to do this.
- No, we don't.

75
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,410
We have to take a nourishment,
to expel waste,

76
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,063
and inhale enough oxygen to
keep our cells from dying.

77
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:08,570
Everything else is optional.

78
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:11,643
Ok, let me put it this way:
I'm doing it.

79
00:05:11,738 --> 00:05:13,972
You can't. I'm the lead author.

80
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:17,822
Come on, the only reason you're the lead
author is because we
went alphabetically.

81
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,373
I let you think we went
alphabetically to spare you

82
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,802
the humiliation with dealing with
the fact that it was my idea.

83
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:25,921
Now to put too fine a point to it,
but I was throwing you a bone.

84
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:27,801
You're welcome.

85
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:31,770
Excuse me, I designed the experiment
that proved the hypothesis.

86
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:33,652
That doesn't mean proving.

87
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:37,320
So the entire scientific community
is just supposed to take your word?

88
00:05:37,385 --> 00:05:39,343
They're not supposed to,
but they should.

89
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:42,053
Alright, I don't
care what you say.

90
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:44,432
I'm going to the conference
and I'm presenting our findings

91
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:46,351
And I forbid it.

92
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:48,342
You forbid it?

93
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:50,972
If I'm not taking credit
for our work then nobody is.

94
00:05:51,036 --> 00:05:53,260
- So, you admit that it's our work.
- No.

95
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:55,401
Once again,
I'm throwing you a bone.

96
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:57,922
And once again,
you are welcome.

97
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:10,153
So, how's it going with Sheldon? Are you
guys still not talking to each other?

98
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:11,881
Not only is he still
not talking to me,

99
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:15,660
but there's this thing he does where he
stares at you and tries to get your
brain to explode.

100
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:20,722
You know, like in the classic
sci-fi movie "Scanners"?

101
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:22,941
Like... . Bzzz.

102
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:25,970
Nevermind.

103
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,673
How about this one?

104
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:31,713
It says, I know my physics,
but I'm still a fun guy.

105
00:06:32,385 --> 00:06:35,521
Oh, I didn't know they
still made corduroy suits.

106
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:37,810
They don't,
that's why I saved this one.

107
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:41,783
Ok, well,
let's just see what else you have.

108
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:44,043
Ok, here. Take this.

109
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:48,103
And this, and this,
and this, and these...

110
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,883
Is this all stuff you
want me to try on?

111
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,722
No, this is stuff I
want you to throw out.

112
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:56,483
Seriously, don't even give it to
charity, you won't be helping anyone.

113
00:06:57,348 --> 00:06:58,892
What's this?

114
00:06:59,238 --> 00:07:01,711
That's the bottled
city of Kandor.

115
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:08,593
You see, Kandor was the capital
city of the planet Krypton.

116
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:11,411
It was miniaturised by Brainiac
before Krypton exploded

117
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:13,313
and then rescued by Superman.

118
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,490
Oh, nice.

119
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:20,393
It's a lot cooler when
girls aren't looking at it.

120
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:24,552
Here, why don't you put these while
I find a shirt and a sport cut match.

121
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:25,592
Right, be right back.

122
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:27,371
Where are you going?
Just put them on.

123
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:28,391
Here?

124
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:30,203
Oh, are you shy?

125
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,871
- No, I'm not shy.
- Don't worry I won't look.

126
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:34,720
I know you won't look.
Why would you look?

127
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:36,253
There's nothing to see...
Well, not 'nothing'...

128
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:38,730
Sweetie, put the pants on.

129
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:43,192
So, you know, isn't there maybe
some way you and Sheldon could

130
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:46,671
- compromise on this whole presentation thing?
- No, No.

131
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:48,490
Scientists do not compromise.

132
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:50,611
Our minds are trained
to synthetize facts

133
00:07:50,655 --> 00:07:52,530
and come to
inarguable conclusions.

134
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:55,700
Not to mention,
Sheldon is back-crap crazy.

135
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:00,383
What is this?

136
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:02,480
Oh, careful.

137
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:06,431
That's my original series
Battlestar Galactica flight suit.

138
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:09,130
Oh, why didn't you
wear it on Halloween?

139
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:11,503
Because it's not a costume,
it's a flight suit.

140
00:08:14,818 --> 00:08:16,910
Ok, alright, moving on.

141
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:19,240
Oh, wow. A paisley shirt.

142
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:21,951
It goes with my corduroy suit.

143
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:25,200
If you mean it should end up in
the same place, then I agree.

144
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:28,755
Is this your only tie?

145
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:32,679
Technically, yes.
But, if you'll notice...

146
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:35,379
It's reversible!

147
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,220
So it works as two.

148
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:42,191
Sweetie, I don't even
think it works as one.

149
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:45,663
- Is this all your clothes?
- Eh, yeah.

150
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:47,583
Everything since
the eighth grade.

151
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:50,523
- The eighth grade?
- My last growth sprout

152
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:55,720
Ok, well,
let's go back to the curdoroy suit.

153
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:57,711
- Great.
- Yeah.

154
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:01,223
I said no. Put it down.

155
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:09,163
Hey Sheldon.

156
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:10,681
Hello Penny.

157
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:14,113
Get anything good?

158
00:09:15,757 --> 00:09:19,210
Just the latest copy of Applied
Particle Physics quarterly.

159
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,520
Oh, you know, that is so weird
that yours came and mine didn't.

160
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:29,882
It was a joke.

161
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:36,032
Yep.

162
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:38,693
Tip you waitresses.
I'm here all week.

163
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:41,842
Penny, just to save you
from further awkwardness,

164
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,363
know that I'm perfectly comfortable with
the two of us climbing the stairs
in silence.

165
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:48,152
Oh, yeah ok, me too.
Zip it, lock it.

166
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:52,082
Put it in your pocket.

167
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:58,992
- So, you and Leonard...
- Oh dear God...

168
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:01,292
Little misunderstanding, huh?

169
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:03,141
A little misunderstanding... ?

170
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:06,500
Galileo and the Pope had
a little misunderstanding.

171
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,993
Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this
morning and I think he feels really bad
about it.

172
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:17,710
How do you feel?

173
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:20,521
I don't understand
the question.

174
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:25,282
I'm just asking if it's difficult to
be fighting with your best friend.

175
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,591
I haven't thought
about it like that.

176
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:31,763
I wonder if I've been experiencing
physiological manifestations

177
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:34,433
of some sort of unconscious
emotional turmoil

178
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:36,853
Wait, what?

179
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:38,813
I couldn't poop this morning.

180
00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:46,271
You should just talk to him,
I'm sure you guys can work this out.

181
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,431
- Certainly preferable to my plan.
- Which was?

182
00:10:49,828 --> 00:10:51,240
A powerful laxative.

183
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:55,621
You absolutely
should talk to him.

184
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:58,402
Look, I know Leonard values you as
a friend and he told me himself

185
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,980
without your little idea there's no way
he could come up with this whole
experiment thing.

186
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:07,943
Excuse me. "Little idea"?

187
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:09,962
Yeah, I mean he tried
to explain it to me,

188
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,831
- I didn't really understand it but...
- Of course you didn't.

189
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:13,413
He said: "Little idea"?

190
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,660
Oh, well, no... Not...

191
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:19,170
- Not in those words.
- In what words then, exactly?

192
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:22,683
Oh, you know... Gee. The exact words
are... It's more the spirit in which
he said...

193
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:25,131
- What did he say?
- You had a lucky hunch

194
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,221
Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking,
instead of arguing about this...

195
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:31,220
Don't you ever
speak to me again.

196
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:34,813
What... ?

197
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:50,023
Ok, I'm leaving
for the conference.

198
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:52,720
Have fun presenting
my "lucky hunch"

199
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:54,550
Shel, I didn't
mean it like that.

200
00:11:54,678 --> 00:11:56,431
- Then why did you say it?
- I don't know, I wasn't...

201
00:11:56,467 --> 00:12:00,202
- Were you trying to impress Penny?
- No, no, not at all. A little bit.

202
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,253
How did that work out for you?

203
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:07,060
- Leonard, ready to go?
- Libido: 1 Truth: 0.

204
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:11,283
Ok, I'm gonna ask
you one more time.

205
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:13,843
We did the work together,
let's present the paper together.

206
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,772
And I'm telling you
for the last time,

207
00:12:15,897 --> 00:12:18,723
it's pandering,
it's undignifying, and bite me.

208
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,122
Let's go.

209
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,240
- Bye Sheldon.
- Goodbye Penny.

210
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:37,023
One of these days... bshh!

211
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:41,582
There you go.

212
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,480
You're right this side
does look better.

213
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,393
No, no, I didn't say better,
I said "less stained".

214
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:51,381
I just checked the house.
There's probably 20-25 people in there.

215
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:53,000
- You're kidding!
- Is that all?

216
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:56,521
"All? " In particle
physics 25 is Woodstock!

217
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:01,902
- Then good!
- I wasn't expecting such a crowd,

218
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:03,030
I'm all nervous.

219
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:05,323
It's ok, just open with a joke,
you'll be fine.

220
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:07,540
A joke... Ok.

221
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,450
How about this? Um, ok...

222
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:12,022
There's this farmer

223
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:16,072
and he has these chickens but
they won't lay any eggs, so...

224
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:18,190
He calls a physicist to help.

225
00:13:18,418 --> 00:13:21,141
The physicist then does
some calculations,

226
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:24,732
and he says:
"I have a solution,

227
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:29,302
but it only works for spherical
chickens in a vacuum".

228
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:32,870
Right?

229
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:39,800
Oh, sorry,
I just had heard it before.

230
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:43,563
- Let's roll. Hey, nice suit.
- It's a classic, right?

231
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:47,442
I really should have
brought my own car.

232
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:51,652
So, in conclusion,

233
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:54,552
the data show that at temperatures
approaching absolute zero,

234
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:58,171
the moment of inertia changes,
and a solid becomes a supersolid,

235
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:02,311
which clearly appears to be a
previously unknown state of matter.

236
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:06,302
Thank you!

237
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,510
- Are there any questions?
- Yeah.

238
00:14:13,747 --> 00:14:15,511
What the hell was that?

239
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:19,241
Any other questions?

240
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:24,391
Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the
lead author of this particular paper.

241
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:27,121
Thank you.

242
00:14:29,138 --> 00:14:33,521
And you sir, you have completely skipped
over the part where I was walking
through the park

243
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:36,912
and I saw these children on a
merry-go-round which started me thinking

244
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:39,830
about the moment of inertia
in gases like helium

245
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:41,891
at temperatures
approaching absolute zero.

246
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,811
I didn't skip it.
It's just an anecdote, it's not science.

247
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:47,923
Oh, I see. It was the apple
falling on Newton's head,

248
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:50,610
- was that just an anecdote?
- You are not Isaac Newton.

249
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:54,051
No, no, that's true. Gravity would have
been apparent to me without the apple.

250
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:56,540
You cannot possibly
be that arrogant.

251
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:59,020
You continue to underestimate me,
my good man.

252
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:03,482
Look, if you weren't happy with my
presentation then maybe you should have
given it with me!

253
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:05,530
As I have explained repeatedly,
unlike you,

254
00:15:05,558 --> 00:15:07,990
I don't need validation
from lesser minds.

255
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:08,842
No offense.

256
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,612
Really, so why did you come?

257
00:15:10,635 --> 00:15:12,072
Because I knew
you'd screw this up.

258
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:13,423
I didn't screw it up!

259
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,852
Oh, please.
I admit that spherical chicken joke,

260
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:16,871
- that was hilarious.
- Thank you.

261
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:18,800
But it was straight
downhill from there.

262
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:21,101
I've had enough of
your condescendship.

263
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:24,171
Maybe I didn't go to college
when I was 11 like you.

264
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:27,673
Maybe I got my doctorate
at 24 instead of 16

265
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:29,380
but you are not the only
person who is smarter than

266
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,801
everyone else in this room!

267
00:15:32,185 --> 00:15:32,793
No offense.

268
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:36,621
And I am clearly
not the only person

269
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:38,410
who is tormented by insecurity

270
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,540
and has an ego in need
of constant validation!

271
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,282
So you admit you're an egotist?

272
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:43,292
Yes!

273
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:47,682
My name is doctor Leonard Hofstadter
and I can never please my parents so

274
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,061
I need all my self esteem
from strangers like you!

275
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:51,160
But he's worse!

276
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:53,073
Ok, that's it!

277
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:54,023
Stop it!

278
00:15:56,726 --> 00:15:59,321
You cannot blow up my
head with your mind!

279
00:15:59,536 --> 00:16:01,252
Then I'll settle
for your aneurism!

280
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:03,441
- Stop it!
- You hit me!

281
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:04,692
You saw that he hit me!

282
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:06,320
You tried to blow up my head!

283
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:07,263
So it was working!

284
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:09,642
It wa... It was not!
You're a nutcase!

285
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:10,623
We'll see about that!

286
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:12,090
Heads up,
you people in the front row!

287
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,351
This is a splash zone!

288
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:15,161
Stop it!

289
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:16,173
Just quit it!

290
00:16:22,306 --> 00:16:24,540
Is this usually how
these physics things go?

291
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,222
More often than you think.

292
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:44,623
You could have offered
me a ride home.

293
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:48,290
You're lucky I
didn't run you over.

294
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,270
I really don't understand
what you're so unhappy about.

295
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:52,951
You begged me to come, I came.

296
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:54,150
There's just no pleasing you.

297
00:16:55,155 --> 00:16:57,711
You're right, I'm the problem,
I'm the one that needs help.

298
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:00,381
Well, that's not much of an
apology but I'll take it.

299
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:02,781
Excuse me,

300
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,591
is there anything you
would apologise for?

301
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:07,812
Yes.

302
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:11,112
I'm sorry I tried to
blow up your head.

303
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:14,182
It was uncalled for.

304
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,601
You won't believe this.

305
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,513
Somebody got the whole thing with
their cell phone and put it on YouTube!

306
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:21,270
What?

307
00:17:22,968 --> 00:17:25,212
- Who would do that?
- That would be me.

308
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:28,712
Hey, check it out,
it's a featured video!

309
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,730
He hit me!
You saw that he hit me!

310
00:17:31,837 --> 00:17:34,802
- Then it was working!
- It was not working! You're a nutcase!

311
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:35,842
We will see about that!

312
00:17:35,897 --> 00:17:37,151
You people in the
front row heads up!

313
00:17:37,185 --> 00:17:38,450
This is splash zone

314
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:42,641
Stop it! Leave it, leave it!

315
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:47,682
You want a volcano nerve pinch!

316
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:51,760
You should clip your fingernails!
Those hurt!

317
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:56,453
Oh, Jeez.
does this suit really look that bad?

318
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:59,441
Forget your suit,
look at my arms waving.

319
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:01,073
I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.

320
00:18:04,197 --> 00:18:04,880
Howard,

321
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,541
would you like to explain to
me why your Facebook page

322
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:09,831
has a picture of me sleeping
on your shoulder captioned

323
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:11,290
"me and my girlfriend"?

324
00:18:13,637 --> 00:18:15,663
Uh oh, here comes the talk.

325
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:26,452
- You hit me!
- You tried to blow up my head!

326
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:29,493
- So it was working!
- It was not working! You're a nutcase!

327
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:32,481
What losers

328
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:35,481
Yeah Gigantic American geeks

329
00:18:38,456 --> 00:18:41,183
who's doing that?

330
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:46,280
Someone from Pasadena,
California named...

331
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:50,880
"Wolowizard"

332
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:53,883
Awesome!
