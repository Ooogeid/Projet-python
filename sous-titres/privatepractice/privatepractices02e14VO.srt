1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,339
- What, are you following me now?
- You wouldn't call me back.

2
00:00:05,411 --> 00:00:07,045
You didn't call me at all.
I didn't know you were here...

3
00:00:07,151 --> 00:00:08,584
- For now.
- Working for Charlotte...

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,349
- For now.
- And sleeping with my best friend again.

5
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:12,640
You really should knock
before you walk into a doctor's office.

6
00:00:12,758 --> 00:00:15,543
It was funny. Twice I come to town,
twice you walk in on me.

7
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:16,778
- I have a patient.
- I know.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,467
Jane williams...
30 years old, 33 weeks pregnant.

9
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:20,914
Ambulance just brought her in.
She's having a stroke.

10
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:22,990
- What, how...
- Good, you're both here.

11
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:25,692
You've met my new neurologist.
Your patient has neurological problems.

12
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:26,381
I called him in.

13
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:29,104
Okay... Tim, can you tell me
what happened?

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,672
She was eating breakfast,
and we were arguing.

15
00:00:31,786 --> 00:00:34,793
Suddenly her orange juice drops.
It just falls out of her hand, and

16
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:37,302
there's orange juice everywhere,
and Jane can't speak.

17
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:38,821
The baby's heartbeat is normal.

18
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:40,582
Jane, I'm Dr. Montgomery.

19
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:42,173
Can you understand what I'm saying?

20
00:00:42,347 --> 00:00:44,372
Are you in any pain?

21
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:45,391
Jane, it's okay.

22
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:47,721
If you understand what he's saying,
nod your head.

23
00:00:47,818 --> 00:00:49,752
Good. Just try to relax.
We're here to help you.

24
00:00:49,836 --> 00:00:52,151
When did this all happen...
the orange juice and the not talking?

25
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,010
I don't know.
An hour ago, maybe longer.

26
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:56,503
I need you to be as exact as possible.
It's important.

27
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:58,333
An hour...
an hour and 20 minutes ago.

28
00:00:58,418 --> 00:01:00,641
Good...
Then we still have Time.

29
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:03,141
She didn't have a stroke.
She's having one right now.

30
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:05,420
And if I can stop it
in the next hour and 40 minutes,

31
00:01:05,497 --> 00:01:08,340
there's a pretty good chance that I can
prevent any permanent brain damage.

32
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:09,780
And what about the baby?

33
00:01:09,955 --> 00:01:12,202
If you treat Jane, what...
what happens to the baby?

34
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:19,741
<i>Private Practice S02E14
Second Chances<i>

35
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:30,951
Did the fight cause this?

36
00:01:31,126 --> 00:01:35,331
Strokes can just happen, often without
warning. There are no predictors.

37
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:39,661
- You two...
- The divorce has been ugly.

38
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:42,393
She hates that this baby keeps me
in her life.

39
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:45,480
At was the last thing
she said right before she...

40
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:48,322
she wished that she wasn't pregnant

41
00:01:48,786 --> 00:01:50,883
so she'd never have to see me again.

42
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:53,070
Good news.
There's no evidence of a bleed,

43
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:55,721
which means I can perform
an endovascular clotvacuation.

44
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:57,022
Excuse me just a minute.

45
00:01:57,138 --> 00:01:59,023
I don't want you fishing around
inside her brain.

46
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:01,250
You should use T.P.A.
to bust the clots.

47
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:02,892
It's contraindicated in pregnancy.

48
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:05,952
No, it's not, not in the studies
I've read, and I'm the ob-gyn.

49
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:07,491
Oh, I know.
Double board certified.

50
00:02:07,636 --> 00:02:09,461
- Stop. Archie.
- Archie?

51
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:11,121
I guess you are mad.

52
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:14,421
T.P.A. is rolling the dice.
The procedure is something I can control.

53
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:16,861
And if Jane's life were at risk,
it might make sense.

54
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,871
But the stroke isn't gonna kill her
or the baby,

55
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:20,270
- and what you're proposing could.
- All right,

56
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,443
- what about her quality of life?
- The baby is 33 weeks.

57
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:24,773
Its lungs aren't fully developed.
It needs more Time.

58
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:27,111
T.P.A.Offers that.
I'm a good neurologist, Addie.

59
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,362
Some might say I'm a great one.
You used to say it.

60
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:31,423
We have a little over an hour
to stop this stroke,

61
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,601
and I am telling you
that we can save both of them.

62
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:36,723
You got it?

63
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:38,813
One sticky bun from damn those donuts,

64
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:40,742
one bagel with onions from canter's,

65
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:43,930
a fruit bowl and a maraschino frapp?

66
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:46,260
- from the juice collective.
- Where's my coffee?

67
00:02:46,438 --> 00:02:49,272
- You can't have coffee, Violet.
- I'm not giving up coffee.

68
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:52,113
- Maraschino?
- They were out of pomegranate.

69
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:53,302
Oh, my god.

70
00:02:54,036 --> 00:02:55,303
Did you get two?

71
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:58,101
That's for Charlotte.

72
00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:03,111
An apple fritter makes up
for you refusing her marriage proposal?

73
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:05,580
I didn't turn her down.
I delayed on your advice.

74
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:06,900
And speaking of advice...

75
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:09,900
pregnancy cravings
are not a license to eat poorly.

76
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,231
It's not a pregnancy craving.
I'm just hungry.

77
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:15,350
Page 156... read all about cravings,

78
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:16,902
which, by the way,
is what you are having.

79
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:19,871
Page 336... people who are not pregnant
should butt out,

80
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:21,181
which, by the way, means you.

81
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:22,882
You know, I couldn't find the page
I was really looking for,

82
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:24,700
which is the one that says
it's important for you

83
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:27,740
to tell the father
that you are pregnant.

84
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:30,933
I don't know if either one of them
wants kids.

85
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,700
I don't know if I want kids.

86
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:35,011
Don't you think it's time you found out?

87
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:40,162
- You have to tell someone, Violet.
- I did. I told you.

88
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:45,743
Everything okay?

89
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:53,033
What's... wrong?

90
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,612
I don't think I can talk to you
about this.

91
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:56,991
What, Nai?
You can talk to me anything.

92
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:58,940
It... involves another man.

93
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:03,513
shoot.

94
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:08,250
Addison caught me and Archer
having sex in his new office,

95
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:11,272
which is on the fourth floor
of Pacific Wellcare.

96
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:15,762
Sam, are you...

97
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:25,512
So you need to...give me advice.

98
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:27,762
Right, right.
Okay. So...

99
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:31,443
Are you worried about Addison
finding out

100
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,830
that you are sleeping with her brother,

101
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,650
or are you worried about everybody
finding out

102
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:39,821
that you kept Archer getting a job
downstairs a secret?

103
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:42,811
Both.
But... really,

104
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:45,690
I'm worried that she's gonna guilt him
into not having sex with me again,

105
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:48,403
because the sex is really good.

106
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:50,783
- Are you okay?
- No... I have a girlfriend.

107
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:51,732
So I'm good.

108
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:54,263
- How's it going with Sonya...
- Really...

109
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:58,231
it's incredibly...
she's... she's making me wait.

110
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:00,410
We... we're waiting...

111
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:01,672
until she's ready.

112
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:03,991
But... but she's ready now, so...

113
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:06,633
Take your inhaler.

114
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:10,462
Nai, I'm not a virgin anymore.
All right.

115
00:05:10,636 --> 00:05:11,620
All right.

116
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:18,360
I never thought we'd get here.

117
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:20,322
We're friends.

118
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:22,880
Yeah, we got here.

119
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:24,981
Friends.

120
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:37,192
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Is Dr. Wilder in?

121
00:05:37,277 --> 00:05:38,020
I have an appointment.

122
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,010
No. He's actually
running a little bit late.

123
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:41,820
You okay?

124
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:44,631
I must look pretty crappy?

125
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:47,040
No, I just...
I had a rough morning, you know?

126
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:48,230
One of those mornings.

127
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:49,892
But is Pete gonna...
gonna be here soon?

128
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:51,160
Why don't I just show you back
to his office?

129
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:53,921
- He should be here any second.
- Oh, great.

130
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,482
When I got the call
about Terri's accident...

131
00:05:58,047 --> 00:05:59,460
I was so stunned.

132
00:06:00,315 --> 00:06:01,541
She was so...

133
00:06:02,315 --> 00:06:05,082
so excited when she foundut
she was pregnant.

134
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:09,130
She and Mark...didn't think
it was ever going to happen, but...

135
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:10,311
you made them believe.

136
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,380
I'm so, so sorry about what's happened.

137
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,073
You know, it's just...
one stupid guy...

138
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:17,280
drinks and drives, and...

139
00:06:18,406 --> 00:06:20,153
my whole family's gone.

140
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:22,403
I came here today

141
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:26,913
because Terri
and Mark died without a will.

142
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:30,830
The extra embryos
they had leftover...

143
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,520
the ones you have frozen?

144
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,382
They've been left to me.

145
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,111
Were you interested in donating them?

146
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:39,914
I'd like them.

147
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:42,070
For myself.

148
00:06:43,198 --> 00:06:44,912
I want to have a baby...

149
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:47,252
my daughter's baby.

150
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:53,160
Hey, Keith.
Dell said that...

151
00:06:57,198 --> 00:07:00,471
Dell, get me a two mix of narcan
and call an ambulance.

152
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:05,762
Keith.
Can you hear me?

153
00:07:08,398 --> 00:07:11,212
I called 9-1-1. Here...
Is there anything I can do?

154
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:20,061
How long has he been using it?

155
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,080
He came to me a few years ago
for help with stress.

156
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,500
He's a real state agent.
He lives and dies by the Market.

157
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:27,053
Last year, the Market crashed.
Addiction took over.

158
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:30,253
The guy's a total mess. He lost his job,
his wife. He's got hep-C.

159
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:31,151
Trifecta.

160
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:33,660
I've been treating him for free,
but I think the real reason he comes is

161
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:35,540
because I give him clean needles.

162
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:37,490
You started a needle exchange program?

163
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,262
Sam, I know this guy.
He should not die in the streets.

164
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:42,981
Right now, this is the only way
I can help him.

165
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:45,723
What the...

166
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:48,083
- How did I...
- I found you on the floor.

167
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:50,280
- You O.D.'d.
- Oh, I feel like crap.

168
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,241
I know you feel bad,
but we got you breathing again.

169
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:54,520
- We got an ambulance coming.
- My head. It hurts.

170
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:57,300
Easy. Just relax.
Why don't you lay back down?

171
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,683
- What, are you trying to kill me?
- Nobody is trying to hurt you, Keith.

172
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:02,401
We're just trying to help.

173
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:10,391
You all right?

174
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:14,802
They seem like a nice couple.

175
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:17,083
They're divorced and they barely speak.

176
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:19,901
Well, I guess they spoke long enough
to conceive.

177
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:22,840
Speaking of not speaking, are we really
gonna have a fight about Naomi again?

178
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:25,401
- You think I'm mad about Naomi?
- Oh, good. You're not mad.

179
00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:26,950
This is you not mad.

180
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,420
Like the time I loaned your cashmere
sweater to Crystal McCullogh.

181
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:30,303
She puked on it.

182
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:32,923
She puked up strawberry daiquiri
all over my sweater.

183
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:34,241
But you weren't mad.

184
00:08:34,545 --> 00:08:37,520
I wasn't mad that you loaned it.
I was mad that you lied.

185
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:40,161
And I'm not mad about Naomi.
I'm mad that you took a job

186
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:42,520
with a practice
that is trying to bury me.

187
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:44,712
You knew about and
you didn't have the guts to tell me.

188
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:48,590
Wyatt left, chasing some ridiculous
amount of pharmaceutical cash.

189
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:51,511
So Charlotte needed a big name.
Who better but me?

190
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:54,460
Why are you here, Archer?

191
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,693
There were some things in New York
I wanted to get away from.

192
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:58,813
Like?
Stalker ex-girlfriend?

193
00:08:58,986 --> 00:09:01,631
Publisher who knew where you lived?
There's always something.

194
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:05,322
After the way we left things,
I wanted to try again, make it better.

195
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:07,143
Look, let's do this case.

196
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:08,841
See how much you enjoy working with me.

197
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:11,493
- As long as we do it your way?
- Well, that would help.

198
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,422
It's the right way, Addie.

199
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,082
I'm just concerned.

200
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:19,661
Look, I know I'm a 52-year-old litigator
and not a 19-year-old cheerleader,

201
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:23,500
but... my gynecologist
started me on hormone therapy,

202
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:25,142
and he thinks I'm ready
for implantation.

203
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:27,130
Yeah, but it's not just age.

204
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:30,132
The stress of losing your daughter,
that takes its physical toll.

205
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:33,420
And it doesn't exactly make you
an ideal candidate for I.V.F.

206
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:36,192
Terri wanted to bring
a baby into this world,

207
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,602
more than anything, and I can do that.

208
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:41,090
I can bring her baby into the world.

209
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:45,181
Well, your gynecologist was right.
You are certainly ready.

210
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:47,481
But having your own grandchild?

211
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:51,103
- You're still grieving, Sharon.
- This isn't about grief.

212
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:54,403
This is about honoring my daughter.

213
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,292
- I've never seen Keith that bad.
- Yeah, well, at some point,

214
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:01,812
you're just gonna have to call
the police and let them handle it.

215
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:03,212
I know how you feel
about addicts, Dell...

216
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:05,282
I'm not being punitive, okay?
I'm not mad.

217
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:06,620
It's just obvious
that the guy needs help,

218
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:08,380
and you tried,
and it's not working, and

219
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:10,510
at least in Jail,
he'll have to go cold Turkey.

220
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:12,512
- Jail isn't the answer for him.
- I don't know.

221
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:13,861
- I think Dell's right.
- Thank you.

222
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:15,692
Keith needs to be in a program.

223
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,072
I've talked to him about it before.

224
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:19,412
I know he has it in him to get clean
with the right kind of help.

225
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:21,423
You really think you can get through
to this guy?

226
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:23,070
I think I should try.

227
00:10:28,955 --> 00:10:30,783
Jane, I know
that you want to talk to us,

228
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,213
and I know that you're scared, but all
these people here, all this equipment,

229
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:35,382
is to help you get better.

230
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:37,822
I'm gonna give you some sedative,
enough to keep you comfortable,

231
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:41,382
but I need for you to be awake so
that we can test things as we go, okay?

232
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,951
I need you to trust me.
My sister trusts me. So can you.

233
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:49,812
- Your baby is doing great.
- Stay with me, Jane, okay?

234
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,431
We're gonna get you through this.

235
00:10:56,716 --> 00:10:58,083
Brought you a peace offering.

236
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,573
Your favorite:
fritters, warm apple,

237
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:03,300
deep fried for your
southern taste buds.

238
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:06,583
We have breakfast here, Cooper.

239
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,583
Well, maybe you can skip
breakfast here, and we...

240
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:13,912
Look, I understand you're angry,
but you can't not talk to me.

241
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:16,313
I'm sorry I said no
about the marriage,

242
00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:19,270
but I did tell you I wanted
to spend the rest of my life with you.

243
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:21,932
Can you tell me what I did wrong
that's so unforgivable?

244
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:24,911
If you really don't get it,
I can't help you.

245
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:30,240
- Well, we have to talk about this.
- No, we don't. And we won't.

246
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:32,982
So save the rest of your earnest little
"i can make it all better" act, 

247
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:34,302
and leave, okay?

248
00:11:44,526 --> 00:11:45,911
It's good, isn't it?

249
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,351
See, this is fortuitous,
finding you here.

250
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:51,373
We need to talk,
and you've been avoiding.

251
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:53,121
Avoidance isn't good for anyone, Violet.

252
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:55,151
I'm not avoiding you, Sheldon.
I've just been very busy.

253
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,501
And... I have a patient waiting, so...

254
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,512
- Hey, cooper. You going back up?
- Oh, good. You guys are talking.

255
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,100
- At least someone's talking.
- In fact, we're not talking.

256
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:05,903
We're talking, Sheldon.
I love talking to you.

257
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:07,923
I love spending time with you.
I'm just...

258
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,223
Busy. I know.

259
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:11,941
Cute kids.

260
00:12:12,786 --> 00:12:14,161
Over there, Sheldon.

261
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:17,291
- Don't you think?
- I guess,

262
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,470
in small doses.
I'm not really a kid person.

263
00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:20,980
They don't seem to like me.

264
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:22,042
So you don't have kids of your own?

265
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:23,903
No. God, no, thankfully.

266
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:25,991
Well, you must see them
in your practice.

267
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:27,820
I bet you're great with 'em.

268
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:31,773
You know what I find?
I'm okay with kids in short bursts.

269
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:33,142
Beyond that...

270
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:35,373
well, it's not a problem, is it?

271
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:42,712
- Are you miserable or starving?
- Both.

272
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:45,852
- Anything you want to talk about?
- This is doing the trick.

273
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:49,321
- Terri Hughes' mother came in today.
- Why?

274
00:12:49,628 --> 00:12:51,920
We have Terri and Mark's embryos
in our freezer.

275
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:54,563
And she wants them implanted...
in her.

276
00:12:56,397 --> 00:12:58,622
- I don't know what to do.
- I do. Say no.

277
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:02,252
Well, I know there are issues with her
carrying her own grandchild and her age,

278
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:05,373
- but Sharon seems to think...
- I'm not interested in Sharon's reasons.

279
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:07,613
Terri was my patient.
I'm interested in what she'd think.

280
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,583
And she would never,
ever want this.

281
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:11,191
How can you be so sure?

282
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:12,981
Terri hated her mother.

283
00:13:13,497 --> 00:13:15,470
Giving that woman another child...

284
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:16,930
Terri's child...

285
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:19,523
would've been her worst nightmare.

286
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:28,853
I'm twisting the coil,
capturing the clot.

287
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:31,263
A few more minutes
I'll beable to pull it outta there,

288
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:34,063
returning the blood flow
in your brain back to normal.

289
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:37,091
- Can you keep her still, please?
- She's having uterine contractions.

290
00:13:37,145 --> 00:13:38,160
Well, you're gonna have to stop that.

291
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:40,350
- I will. Draw up terbutaline.
- Quickly, please.

292
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:41,941
You just focus
so you don't nick a vessel.

293
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:43,421
Jane, I know you're in a lot of pain,

294
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:44,961
but I need you to stay
as still as possible.

295
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:46,772
- We're running out of time.
- Just give it a minute.

296
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:49,331
- Heart rate's up.
- 120. 140.

297
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:52,620
It's a side effect from the terbutaline.
Just a few more seconds.

298
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:54,613
Stay with us Jane.
Okay?

299
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:56,532
Contractions are slowing.

300
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:00,351
Captured the clot.
Removing the coil...

301
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:04,382
and injecting the dye.

302
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:07,793
Oh, isn't that a pretty sight?

303
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,081
No, no, okay, all right.

304
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:12,021
Do you think it's ever appropriate
for a mother

305
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,741
to be implanted with the embryos
of her daughter?

306
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,522
I was dreading the choice between power
berry and dragonfruit vitaminwater.

307
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:20,590
Look, okay, mothers act as surrogates
for their daughters all the time.

308
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:23,062
If Sharon wants a baby so badly,
let her adopt.

309
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:25,702
Sharon doesn't want any child.
She wants their child.

310
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:26,711
She doesn't deserve it.

311
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:28,651
Well, I don't like it any more
than you do.

312
00:14:28,685 --> 00:14:30,000
- But if I don't do it, she's just...
- Well, she just...

313
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:32,002
she just goes to another doctor
for implantation, right?

314
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:33,520
I mean, they're her property.

315
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:34,983
By law...
I'm not saying they should be.

316
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:36,290
She's 52.

317
00:14:36,398 --> 00:14:39,701
There are very few doctors who could
successfully impregnate a woman her age.

318
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:42,260
If Naomi says no,
then the problem ends here.

319
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:45,201
But isn't getting older women pregnant
part of the beauty of I.V.F.?

320
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:48,700
They get to have Time,
have careers and still be moms.

321
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:51,513
And what does that mean for their kids?

322
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:57,331
I mean, can you imagine volunteering
to be team mom in soccer in your 50s,

323
00:14:57,507 --> 00:15:00,132
or going prom dress shopping
in your 60s?

324
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:01,470
I don't know. Maybe the

325
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:04,331
fact that Terri hated her mother
makes the decision for me.

326
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:06,792
I don't have to worry about age
or grief.

327
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:08,433
She should not be a mother.

328
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,832
People become parents at different times
in their lives for different reasons.

329
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:13,022
It's not always ideal,

330
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:15,003
but if this woman is willing
to make a good faith effort

331
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:17,450
to be the kind of parent she knows
she should've been before,

332
00:15:17,628 --> 00:15:19,653
why would we be against that?

333
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:23,400
Isn't that what this baby...
any baby... deserves?

334
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,300
Pretty good team, you and me.

335
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:39,423
No, we are not a good team.

336
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:42,171
I made a life here, Archer,

337
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:47,481
away from bizzy, away from Derek.
I'm trying to figure out me.

338
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:50,093
And I can't do that with you...

339
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:54,891
- judging everything that I do.
- I will be supremely supportive.

340
00:15:56,028 --> 00:15:58,352
You don't know
how to stay out of my life.

341
00:15:58,528 --> 00:15:59,853
You never have.

342
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:01,503
And when I needed someone

343
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:05,061
to make Phil Davidson pay for leaving me
out at the lake, that was great.

344
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:06,522
But now,

345
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:10,150
when I'm struggling to find my footing
in this place that's mine...

346
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:11,463
I miss you.

347
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:14,520
I miss you, but this isn't a visit.

348
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:17,190
You're in my city.
You're in my building.

349
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:18,823
You're sleeping with my best friend.

350
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:21,161
I mean, you're...
you're in my patient's brain!

351
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:23,423
I'm not moving in with you, Addie.

352
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:25,810
I just wanted to be closer.

353
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:28,270
You have to go.

354
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:32,863
I love you, but you have...
you have to go.

355
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:59,230
- You know, this is crazy, Charlotte.
- What, riding the elevator?

356
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,451
With the masking and the sarcasm.

357
00:17:02,517 --> 00:17:05,563
It's like we take one steps forward
and two steps back.

358
00:17:05,995 --> 00:17:07,810
I want you to talk to me.

359
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:11,343
Do you not see that we are
a perfect match

360
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:13,091
and you're screwing it up?

361
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:15,891
I got embarrassed and humiliated.

362
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,111
So don't tell me
about screwing things up.

363
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:20,113
You think it's easy for me
to look you in the face

364
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:22,221
after I sobbed in your lap
like a 12-year-old girl,

365
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,212
asked you to marry me

366
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:25,852
and got turned down?

367
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,923
- You shouldn't feel humiliated.
- Well, it happened, and I do,

368
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:36,462
and there is nothing you can do
about it.

369
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,670
- He's dead, isn't he?
- No, Ellen. It's...

370
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:48,522
it's not that.
I'm sorry to startle you.

371
00:17:48,606 --> 00:17:50,202
I'm looking for Keith.

372
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:51,520
Come in.

373
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:55,480
He stopped by my office this morning.

374
00:17:58,237 --> 00:18:01,202
He O.D.'d. I helped him,
and then he ran off.

375
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:03,411
I haven't seen him in months.

376
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:05,282
I'm surprised he even came to you.
He...

377
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,933
- he can't afford it.
- We have a deal.

378
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:08,660
He stops by so I can keep an eye on him.

379
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:10,360
I give him clean needles
so he doesn't spread...

380
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:12,711
You're helping him get high.

381
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:15,303
- I'm helping him stay safe.
- It's enabling.

382
00:18:15,436 --> 00:18:18,252
I should know,
because I was queen of enabling, but,

383
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:19,793
it doesn't work.

384
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:22,770
I had to cut him off,
for his good and for mine.

385
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:24,022
He's an addict.

386
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:25,710
I know. It's a horrible disease.

387
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:29,580
Well, call it a disease if you want.
It's politically correct. I get it.

388
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:32,133
But he chooses to shoot up.

389
00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:35,323
And I choose not to have
anything to do with him.

390
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:36,620
This man...

391
00:18:40,145 --> 00:18:42,110
this is my husband...

392
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,701
the man I loved.

393
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:47,451
I'm trying to help you get him back.

394
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:50,120
It's not up to you, Pete.

395
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:52,511
It's up to him.

396
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,022
And he's beyond help.

397
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:04,853
How's she doing?

398
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,030
Archer was able to stop the stroke.

399
00:19:10,295 --> 00:19:12,173
He woke her up, but there's swelling.

400
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:13,781
So she's still paralyzed on the side.

401
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:17,252
She hasn't been able to talk yet,
but he's very hopeful.

402
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:20,472
- And the baby?
- Everything's looking good, Tim.

403
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:28,162
Did you wanna...
go in there and see her?

404
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:31,043
She doesn't want me here.

405
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:34,182
I'll let her family know
that she's okay.

406
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:46,372
What do you think about me
staying over tonight?

407
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,133
I don't want Maya to wake up
and see you here in the morning.

408
00:19:50,218 --> 00:19:52,561
I could sneak out early.
I'll sneak out.

409
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:54,721
I am sorry, but I can't.

410
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:56,812
But I will make it up to you.

411
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,311
Tomorrow night?

412
00:19:58,716 --> 00:20:00,453
Yeah, actually, I can't.

413
00:20:00,728 --> 00:20:03,033
- I have a date.
- You have a date?

414
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:05,962
- With another woman?
- Well, I don't date men.

415
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:08,920
- I support the choice, but...
- Funny.

416
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,990
- Funny guy.
- You're upset.

417
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,563
No, I'm not upset.

418
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:15,962
I'm not. I'm just...

419
00:20:17,196 --> 00:20:18,593
I'm surprised.

420
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,633
- I thought that we were...
- We are,

421
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:23,821
and it's great.
It's amazing.

422
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:26,221
But I'm not your boyfriend.

423
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:28,582
I didn't say you were my boyfriend.

424
00:20:29,255 --> 00:20:30,192
Look...

425
00:20:30,768 --> 00:20:32,372
I'm the good-time guy.

426
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:34,702
I'm your good-time guy.

427
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,320
And you should enjoy
the good-time guy,

428
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:38,180
'cause the good-time guy

429
00:20:38,665 --> 00:20:39,601
is good.

430
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:43,141
You want to go again?

431
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:46,433
I'll do things that you never heard of.

432
00:20:47,508 --> 00:20:50,352
Okay, but you have to leave right after.

433
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,583
Good-time guy will go,

434
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,062
right after this.

435
00:21:07,495 --> 00:21:08,742
Just a minute.

436
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:19,442
- This is unexpected.
- I know.

437
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,233
I could a called.
Maybe I should a called, but...

438
00:21:23,776 --> 00:21:25,580
I didn't want you to say no.

439
00:21:25,757 --> 00:21:26,693
To what?

440
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:30,572
W should be able to talk about our...
situation.

441
00:21:31,616 --> 00:21:33,252
I'm sorry. Situation?

442
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:36,320
You know what I like most about you?

443
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,672
How easily we can talk about things,

444
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:41,152
how in sync we are,
how we get each other.

445
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:44,951
I get that there's a problem,
I just have no idea what it is.

446
00:21:56,838 --> 00:21:58,651
You're here, talking to Violet.

447
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:00,562
- And you're here.
- I got some gyros, 

448
00:22:00,646 --> 00:22:01,551
and I needed some advice.

449
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,951
But you guys are here talking,
which is great. So I should go.

450
00:22:05,048 --> 00:22:06,693
- Thanks.
- No, don't go.

451
00:22:09,785 --> 00:22:11,433
Gyros for three it is.

452
00:22:17,307 --> 00:22:19,181
- I can wait.
- I'm sorry.

453
00:22:25,037 --> 00:22:27,632
- I need you to decode.
- Sonya's here.

454
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,790
<i>Tell her to</i> call 9-1-1 if necessary.
All right?

455
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:33,261
You're a father.
You can't afford to die <i>for sex.</i>

456
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:35,981
I got this... All right. What do you...
what do you need decoded?

457
00:22:36,077 --> 00:22:39,102
It's Archer. What's a good-time guy?

458
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:42,700
A guy who you have a good time with.

459
00:22:42,797 --> 00:22:44,322
Speaking of which...

460
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:48,301
So do you think I'm the type that
would be okay dating a guy like that?

461
00:22:48,377 --> 00:22:52,050
Well, you were okay sleeping with
a guy like that twice already, so...

462
00:22:52,127 --> 00:22:55,802
I am a divorced woman with standards,
and I have no practice at dating.

463
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:58,332
I mean, is this what people do?
Is this what you're doing?

464
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:01,452
Are you being a good-time guy?
No. I...

465
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,632
Sonya is not a good-time-guy girl.

466
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:05,722
That's... that's why she made me wait.

467
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,761
- So I'm trashy?
- No, you're not trashy.

468
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,430
You are a queen.
You are an african queen.

469
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,083
Who are you calling an african queen?

470
00:23:12,178 --> 00:23:14,352
You are an african earth mother...

471
00:23:15,285 --> 00:23:18,802
Who just happens to be
with a good-time guy.

472
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:21,003
It's-it's okay. It's different.

473
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:23,603
I mean, is it different?
Because it... feels trashy.

474
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,503
Look, okay, I gotta run.
So just... go with the flow.

475
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:29,103
<i>- Is she naked? </i>
- Almost.

476
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,573
- You're nervous?
- Yes, I am, very.

477
00:23:31,746 --> 00:23:34,461
<i>Sonya really likes you. Okay?</i>

478
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:37,851
You already won her over.
Just go for it.

479
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:40,081
Go for it.

480
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:48,003
I've made you wait long enough.

481
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,470
They found you down at the beach.

482
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:05,640
Well, I hope I remembered my sunscreen.

483
00:24:06,135 --> 00:24:08,933
This isn't funny, Keith. You're gonna
have to stay here for a while.

484
00:24:09,107 --> 00:24:10,912
You know I hate hospitals.

485
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:13,310
You have bacterial endocarditis.

486
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:16,612
It's an infection. The kind
'caused by using dirty needles.

487
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:19,272
I gave you new needles
whenever you asked.

488
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:22,103
You have hep-C.
This was to prevent the spread.

489
00:24:22,235 --> 00:24:25,041
- What did you do with the needles?
- I traded them.

490
00:24:25,486 --> 00:24:27,531
I didn't share the dirty needles.

491
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:30,000
You traded my needles for more drugs?

492
00:24:31,168 --> 00:24:34,103
I don't want to be like this anymore,
okay? I'm trying. I am.

493
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:37,203
And I haven't done well, but I can.

494
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:40,193
I can. I know I can,
as soon as I get out of here.

495
00:24:41,508 --> 00:24:44,280
The bacteria is eating away
at your heart, Keith.

496
00:24:44,376 --> 00:24:48,122
Do you understand that?
The hepatitis is destroying your liver.

497
00:24:48,377 --> 00:24:50,513
If you leave now, you will die.

498
00:25:00,358 --> 00:25:02,660
- You mad at me?
- You... 

499
00:25:03,176 --> 00:25:06,800
are a grown woman...
having sex with my brother.

500
00:25:06,878 --> 00:25:09,682
But still...
you are a grown woman.

501
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:13,703
Do you think that...
a responsible grown woman like me,

502
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:18,432
... can also be the type of woman
that goes out with... the good-time guy?

503
00:25:18,606 --> 00:25:20,322
Is that what he's calling himself,
yeah?

504
00:25:20,397 --> 00:25:22,481
And I don't know. Can I?

505
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:29,800
Here's my advice...
be careful listening to my brother.

506
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:32,033
Things don't tend to end well
for the women in his life,

507
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:33,222
and you are my friend.

508
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:36,993
- What, are you mad at him?
- You know, he comes here, and...

509
00:25:38,228 --> 00:25:42,261
It changes me. He pushes me,
and I start acting like a teenager.

510
00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:46,192
I mean, I am a competent woman,
and when he's here, I feel like...

511
00:25:46,705 --> 00:25:48,132
The little sister.

512
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:51,560
You know what?
I'm not blaming him,

513
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:53,532
but part of the reason why I asked Kevin
to move in with me

514
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:57,091
is because Archer kept badgering me
about our relationship not working

515
00:25:57,186 --> 00:26:00,433
and how I was dating out of my element
because Kevin's a cop.

516
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:01,233
S.W.A.T.

517
00:26:01,315 --> 00:26:03,733
So I made a choice to prove him wrong,

518
00:26:04,895 --> 00:26:06,141
and he was right.

519
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:07,833
And I hate that.

520
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:10,222
Why don't you try and have
a different relationship with him?

521
00:26:10,308 --> 00:26:13,231
Look at me and Sam: married,
divorced and then awkward,

522
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:15,872
and now we are actually talking
to each other about our love lives 

523
00:26:15,955 --> 00:26:17,792
- with other people.
- You are?

524
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:21,472
and if Sam and I can get past all that,
surely you and Archer can.

525
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:26,170
I gotta go.

526
00:26:31,377 --> 00:26:32,780
She called 9-1-1.

527
00:26:33,285 --> 00:26:34,792
Sweetie. I'm sorry.

528
00:26:37,817 --> 00:26:40,572
My daughter hated me. I know that.

529
00:26:40,936 --> 00:26:43,083
I have no idea what she told you
about me, but

530
00:26:43,157 --> 00:26:44,830
I imagine it wasn't flattering.

531
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:47,742
Well, I could say that
that is privileged, but...

532
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:49,203
I don't think that would help
either one of us

533
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:51,133
to understand what's going on here.

534
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:52,362
So, yes.

535
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:54,921
Terri had negative feelings.

536
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:58,810
That's why I'm not sure
what you are asking for is a good idea.

537
00:27:00,926 --> 00:27:04,473
I do corporate litigation.
I'm good at my work. I love it.

538
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:07,821
And when I got pregnant,
everyone told me,

539
00:27:07,998 --> 00:27:10,730
"don't worry. It'll be amazing.
It'll change your life,"

540
00:27:10,907 --> 00:27:13,081
and it did, but it wasn't amazing.

541
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:16,370
It was hard and exhausting, and...

542
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:21,130
it didn't make me feel
anything like work ever did.

543
00:27:21,215 --> 00:27:24,832
So Terri's sense that you resented her,
it had some basis in fact?

544
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:27,461
I loved my daughter very much.
But she...

545
00:27:27,635 --> 00:27:31,170
she changed my life from
being in control and fulfilled

546
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:34,502
to feeling constantly overwhelmed
and inadequate.

547
00:27:34,675 --> 00:27:35,911
But, Sharon...

548
00:27:37,746 --> 00:27:39,203
listen to yourself.

549
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:43,121
If motherhood for you was more
burden than blessing,

550
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:46,020
why would you want to subject
yourself to that again?

551
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:48,402
Because I want it
to be different this time.

552
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:51,532
- But what makes you assume it could be?
- The pain.

553
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:55,111
I've lived with it every single day
while she was alive

554
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:57,233
not being what she needed.

555
00:27:57,567 --> 00:28:00,982
I kept thinking that at some point,
I would be able to...

556
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:04,070
make the relationship right.

557
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:10,191
I can't bring Terri back, but I...
I can...

558
00:28:11,086 --> 00:28:13,263
have the child that she wanted...

559
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:17,871
and give it love and...
and attention and...

560
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:20,543
the support that she would've...

561
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:23,670
that she deserved...

562
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:28,361
that every child deserves.

563
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:32,450
I am capable of that.

564
00:28:39,438 --> 00:28:42,620
Jane, you're in labor.
I need to deliver the baby now.

565
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:45,082
- It's early, but I think it'll be okay.
- I...

566
00:28:45,258 --> 00:28:46,513
- need...
- It's okay.

567
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:48,980
I'm gonna take care of the baby. Okay?

568
00:28:49,576 --> 00:28:51,263
I was surprised you called.

569
00:28:51,717 --> 00:28:54,731
Look, the baby is in distress, and
Jane's not dilated, but I can't wait.

570
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:56,013
I've gotta do a C-section now, 

571
00:28:56,056 --> 00:28:58,110
but she's still on blood thinners
fromour procedure.

572
00:28:58,176 --> 00:29:00,002
I need to reverse themor
she will bleed out.

573
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:01,242
That'll put her at risk for another stroke.

574
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,611
The baby can't survive without surgery.

575
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:10,033
What if I do a C-section with a spinal?

576
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:12,800
Can you do an intraoperative E.E.G.,
Monitor the neuro status?

577
00:29:12,928 --> 00:29:14,691
That sounds like a good plan.

578
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:16,961
We're gonna get you up to the O.R.

579
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:19,282
- Tim...
- I already called him.

580
00:29:20,068 --> 00:29:21,081
Go ahead.

581
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,793
I want you to hear me out.

582
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:37,953
I told you once, Cooper, no more
talking and expressing. It's done.

583
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:40,503
You know what? It could be done.
It could be done and over.

584
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,312
And there wouldn't even be that
much mess, you're not pregnant, 

585
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:44,313
we don't live together,
there's no vacations planned,

586
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,510
and I don't have one thing
at your house,

587
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,770
and god knows you wouldn't leave
so much as a t-shirt at mine.

588
00:29:47,897 --> 00:29:49,280
But emotionally,

589
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:52,592
I'm not ready to let go.

590
00:29:56,615 --> 00:29:58,803
We are so not the cute couple...

591
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:02,140
in and out of each other's pockets,
finishing each other's sentences-

592
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:04,873
but we're still a couple.
We're us.

593
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,053
And I love us, and I...

594
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:11,573
am nowhere near ready to give up.

595
00:30:15,218 --> 00:30:17,252
Even if you are, I'm not giving up.

596
00:30:17,606 --> 00:30:19,502
Well, won't that be lonely?

597
00:30:34,796 --> 00:30:38,310
Will you sign a 51-50 for Keith embry?
He's a drug addict.

598
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:41,632
You can't lock up an addict
and force them into treatment.

599
00:30:41,748 --> 00:30:43,232
It's more than that.
He's living on the streets,

600
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:45,431
He's got no job, he's not eating,
he's got no clothes...

601
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:47,470
Grave disability.
Okay, you've done your homework.

602
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:48,562
You think it's a bad idea?

603
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:51,003
I think it's better
when people want treatment.

604
00:30:51,086 --> 00:30:52,680
Forced treatment is problematic.

605
00:30:52,796 --> 00:30:55,102
And with addicts...
he'll just lie to you.

606
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:57,232
- But if he stays on the streets,
he's gonna die.
- Maybe,

607
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:59,702
but 72 hours in a psych facility
isn't gonna change that.

608
00:30:59,778 --> 00:31:02,710
72 hours to evaluate, then they can
choose to do a 14-day hold,

609
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:04,780
- and then 30 days.
- Does he have a support system,

610
00:31:04,886 --> 00:31:06,031
a wife or kids?

611
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:09,750
He has a wife, but no kids.
Thank god. That'd be a disaster.

612
00:31:10,277 --> 00:31:13,400
Well, kids can inspire things
in people that adults can't.

613
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:15,212
I mean, if he'd had kids...

614
00:31:15,475 --> 00:31:17,673
I mean, wouldn't it make a difference
if you'd had kids?

615
00:31:17,777 --> 00:31:19,191
I'm past that window.

616
00:31:19,565 --> 00:31:21,151
The sad truth is, it's

617
00:31:21,327 --> 00:31:23,682
 probably better that Anna and I
didn't have kids.

618
00:31:23,856 --> 00:31:25,620
I'm too selfish, and...

619
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:27,530
I get angry.

620
00:31:29,396 --> 00:31:30,161
So...

621
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:32,330
will you sign the 51-50?

622
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:36,081
You know, I think when you...

623
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:39,063
force something on someone that they
don't want, they'll never fully commit.

624
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:41,782
So if he doesn't want this for himself,

625
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,713
he'll just walk out the door.

626
00:31:46,617 --> 00:31:47,443
The...

627
00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:49,240
baby...

628
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:51,882
Almost there, Jane.

629
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:53,303
Hang in.

630
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:54,533
Any bleeding?

631
00:31:54,586 --> 00:31:57,731
Persistent oozing around the edges.
Any changes in her E.E.G.?

632
00:31:57,907 --> 00:31:59,823
- No. She's fine.
- Bovie.

633
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:03,560
Jane, I'm gonna take the baby out now.
Lap pad,

634
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:06,192
and have an intubation tray standing by.

635
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,350
what'S... wrong?

636
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,733
He's not breathing...yet.

637
00:32:16,806 --> 00:32:18,702
Laryngoscope and a suction catheter, now.

638
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:21,103
He's aspirated meconium.
How much time do I have?

639
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,803
You've got about 30 seconds.

640
00:32:22,888 --> 00:32:24,701
Okay, come on. Come on.

641
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:27,101
Stand by with a 3-0 endotracheal tube
and a ventilator.

642
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:30,452
- 20 seconds, Addison.
- Come on, breathe...

643
00:32:35,908 --> 00:32:38,813
He's okay.
He's gonna be okay, Jane.

644
00:32:48,806 --> 00:32:50,412
I think I was wrong...

645
00:32:50,697 --> 00:32:53,331
- about Sharon using Terri's embryos.
- What about Terri?

646
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:55,393
Well, I was thinking about Terri

647
00:32:55,566 --> 00:32:58,251
growing up, about
how she must have felt, and how

648
00:32:58,428 --> 00:33:01,223
kids intuitively know
if their parents resent them.

649
00:33:01,506 --> 00:33:05,250
But I was also thinking that...
that children only see one side,

650
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:10,411
and that if a parent understands their
feelings and really wants to change...

651
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:15,552
I actually think Sharon will be
a different mom this time around.

652
00:33:17,658 --> 00:33:20,331
And she's not just trying
to replace her daughter?

653
00:33:20,508 --> 00:33:21,811
It's not guilt?

654
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:25,470
Maybe the fact that she's committed
to being a good mom...

655
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:29,881
maybe that's reason enough
to give her a second chance.

656
00:33:37,075 --> 00:33:38,962
Keith, what the hell are you doing?

657
00:33:39,078 --> 00:33:42,402
I gotta get outta here.
I'm just... I'm... going crazy.

658
00:33:42,445 --> 00:33:45,302
I'm sorry, Pete, but I just...
I got to, man.

659
00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:48,040
You need to stay.
I need you to get better.

660
00:33:48,336 --> 00:33:51,800
Ellen needs you to get better.
She still wants her husband back.

661
00:33:52,056 --> 00:33:54,333
- I can't be that guy anymore.
- You can.

662
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:57,811
I am not gonna sit back
and let you hurt yourself, Keith.

663
00:33:58,555 --> 00:34:00,692
You have a real chance to get clean.

664
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:03,323
I can't.

665
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:10,202
No... Wait...

666
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:14,630
You're gonna be committed to
the psychiatric ward of St. Ambrose.

667
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:17,901
They have doctors here who specialize
in treating addiction. They can help you.

668
00:34:18,075 --> 00:34:21,913
Oh, you son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch.

669
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,420
All right! Hold on a second...

670
00:34:30,787 --> 00:34:33,203
If it's gonna work, he has to want it.

671
00:34:33,765 --> 00:34:35,112
He can get there.

672
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,052
He's not beyond help.

673
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:40,721
He's not.

674
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:45,553
Here we go.

675
00:34:46,075 --> 00:34:48,431
Wait... Wait, please.
Please wait.

676
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:52,801
What if I'm making a mistake?

677
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:55,411
What if... 

678
00:34:55,995 --> 00:34:58,980
what if... I can't do any better
this time? what if...

679
00:34:59,818 --> 00:35:03,033
What if... I'm just destined
to be a bad mother?

680
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,762
You're not destined to be anything.

681
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:11,670
You have a chance
to be whatever you want.

682
00:35:11,957 --> 00:35:15,002
And if the person you were before
wasn't working,

683
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:17,020
you can change it, and...

684
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:19,822
you can be the kind of mother
that you think

685
00:35:19,888 --> 00:35:23,622
that that baby, that Terri's baby
deserves.

686
00:35:24,326 --> 00:35:27,742
And if you commit to that
and you decide that it's what you want,

687
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:32,061
it'll be amazing...
for both of you.

688
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:36,773
This is the chance you wanted, right?

689
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:40,170
Then take it.

690
00:36:02,747 --> 00:36:04,022
He's beautiful.

691
00:36:04,775 --> 00:36:07,391
Breathing on his own,
you did good, Jane.

692
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:16,431
You want me to hand you the baby?

693
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:18,880
I'm...

694
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:21,270
glad... you're here.

695
00:36:27,117 --> 00:36:28,383
Here you go.

696
00:36:30,578 --> 00:36:31,600
Hi, baby.

697
00:36:46,085 --> 00:36:48,810
Anxiety, induced asthma.
What do you have?

698
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:50,210
For Sam?

699
00:36:50,577 --> 00:36:53,240
- I don't need anything.
- Yes, he does. Sonya is a problem.

700
00:36:53,348 --> 00:36:55,393
- We haven't...
- Sealed the deal.

701
00:36:55,906 --> 00:36:58,613
Well, we've tried. But I just,
I get nervous, and...

702
00:36:58,735 --> 00:37:00,432
and then I start to wheeze.

703
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:04,073
Butterbur and dried I.V. steep it
in hot water for five minutes.

704
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:07,553
One big glass should help reduce
bronchoconstrictions for a few hours.

705
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,722
Good luck.

706
00:37:12,176 --> 00:37:13,910
- what?
- It's just...

707
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:17,652
after everything you two have been
through, you're still... you're...

708
00:37:17,826 --> 00:37:18,833
you're friends.

709
00:37:19,005 --> 00:37:22,113
- Is that weird?
- No... It's great.

710
00:37:23,456 --> 00:37:24,572
I think so.

711
00:37:32,196 --> 00:37:34,151
She'still not talking to you?

712
00:37:34,907 --> 00:37:37,181
I opened my soul, and...

713
00:37:38,035 --> 00:37:38,953
nothing.

714
00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:46,760
Pete doesn't want kids.

715
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:51,153
Sheldon doesn't want kids.

716
00:37:51,565 --> 00:37:53,302
Pete doesn't want kids.

717
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:55,973
I don't want kids...

718
00:37:57,495 --> 00:38:01,563
you know? I mean,
what business do I have having a kid?

719
00:38:02,437 --> 00:38:03,241
Me...

720
00:38:04,545 --> 00:38:07,183
raising a kid by myself
that I don't want

721
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:09,653
- and wouldn't know what to do with...
- Well, you're not alone.

722
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,012
Every night, I wake up in a cold sweat.

723
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:17,281
I lay there panicked
that i'm gonna wait too long.

724
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,211
I'm gonna wait too long...

725
00:38:21,588 --> 00:38:23,103
and then it'll be too late to have an abortion,

726
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:27,011
and then I will just be stuck
and I'll never be free ever again.

727
00:38:27,385 --> 00:38:30,211
I don't know what to do. I mean, all
I know is that unless you're bringing me

728
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:33,132
 sticky buns and gyros and burgers, I...

729
00:38:33,987 --> 00:38:35,433
I'm lost, cooper.

730
00:38:35,506 --> 00:38:38,760
I mean, I see you, and I feel better,
but most of the time, I walk around

731
00:38:38,938 --> 00:38:40,011
lost and...

732
00:38:41,596 --> 00:38:43,220
alone and scared.

733
00:38:46,435 --> 00:38:48,071
Well, then I will be here.

734
00:38:49,177 --> 00:38:52,572
Whenever you need me, I will
be here, and we'll sit and we'll eat

735
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:54,500
and we'll figure this out.

736
00:38:54,608 --> 00:38:59,202
We'll work through everything, and...
make it okay, together.

737
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:06,301
You'd do that for me?

738
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,212
I'd do anything for you.

739
00:39:20,886 --> 00:39:22,880
I am not glad
that you are working for the enemy,

740
00:39:23,006 --> 00:39:25,611
and you're gonna have to learn
to stay out of my personal life,

741
00:39:25,707 --> 00:39:27,870
but if you want to be here, then...

742
00:39:29,816 --> 00:39:31,383
This is gonna be fun.

743
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,492
- I thought you had a date.
- I canceled.

744
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:51,442
So...

745
00:39:52,045 --> 00:39:54,500
- no good-time guy?
- I don't know.

746
00:39:54,766 --> 00:39:57,690
All I know is that I was getting ready
for a date, and I realized that

747
00:39:57,807 --> 00:39:59,330
I would rather be with you.

748
00:40:01,675 --> 00:40:03,322
So I'm more than a good-time girl?

749
00:40:03,415 --> 00:40:05,183
Now I never said that you were
a good-time girl.

750
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,731
Good-time guy, that's me.
No, you...

751
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:10,481
you're a keeper.

752
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:13,281
You let me in?

753
00:40:20,235 --> 00:40:21,761
Where's your child?

754
00:40:23,135 --> 00:40:24,540
She is at a sleepover.

755
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:27,280
Well, then let's get you...
naked.

756
00:40:40,657 --> 00:40:41,983
Peace offering.

757
00:40:42,748 --> 00:40:44,663
Cornbread chicken casserole.

758
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:47,503
Mama used to bring it to the neighbors

759
00:40:47,568 --> 00:40:50,750
to make peace after
Landry and Duke let their pigs out.

760
00:40:51,086 --> 00:40:53,310
it's the only thing I know how to make.

761
00:40:54,657 --> 00:40:56,162
I screwed up, Coop,

762
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,883
and I want to make it right.

763
00:40:59,215 --> 00:41:00,052
So...

764
00:41:00,565 --> 00:41:01,892
I was thinking,

765
00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:05,043
you wanted me to move in
a few months ago. Maybe now...

766
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:07,223
that's the right thing to do...

767
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:08,830
a good first step.

768
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:14,091
What's the matter?

769
00:41:18,737 --> 00:41:20,251
You goin' somewhere?

770
00:41:20,677 --> 00:41:22,490
I'm moving in with Violet.
