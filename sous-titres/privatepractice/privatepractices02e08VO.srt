1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:03,461
Come on.

2
00:00:03,723 --> 00:00:06,492
That is the worst runway walk
I've ever seen. She's not fierce.

3
00:00:06,662 --> 00:00:07,934
Eliminate her.

4
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:15,099
I told you, when the models
are walking, do not call.

5
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:18,471
Doug

6
00:00:27,342 --> 00:00:28,471
Come upstairs.

7
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:31,369
Upstairs.

8
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,193
What's going on?

9
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:35,777
Where's Karen?

10
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:41,580
She's in there.

11
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:44,082
She's been so sick, so sick, and...

12
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:49,231
I didn't know who to call.
You're still my therapist.

13
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:51,514
I didn't know who to call.

14
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,633
It's gonna be all right.

15
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:08,821
I killed her.

16
00:01:10,147 --> 00:01:11,670
I killed my wife.

17
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:22,632
- You did that on purpose.
- Come on, man.

18
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:24,020
If you didn't suck
you wouldn't get hit.

19
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,122
I don't suck.
I played on a team, man.

20
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:29,430
- You suck. Say that to my face.
- I am saying it to your face.

21
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:30,623
You suck!

22
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,523
- We need women.
- Word.

23
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,132
- I hate racquetball.
- Man, she's working in our building.

24
00:01:40,157 --> 00:01:42,243
Charlotte is working in the building.
I can't get away from her.

25
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:44,521
Naomi... she's right down the hall.
You think that's easy?

26
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:46,611
You know, I wish she would just die.

27
00:01:46,787 --> 00:01:48,781
No, not in a bad way. Just like...

28
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:50,162
slightly dead.

29
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:53,072
You know, then I wouldn't have to see
her face. She'd just be a memory.

30
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:54,793
You ever wish Naomi dead?

31
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:57,993
That's... the mother of my child.
Yes, I do, actually.

32
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:00,151
When she had sex with that guy,

33
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:01,813
I wished she was dead.

34
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,733
- All right, let's go again.
- I got you.

35
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:07,633
Hold up.

36
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:11,861
- What's up, Violet?
- She's calling you?

37
00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:14,773
She wouldn't let me call her when the
models are walking. Why is she calling you?

38
00:02:14,846 --> 00:02:17,051
- Traitor.
- I'll be right there.

39
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:19,281
Just a few more notes to make.

40
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:21,252
- Ten minutes tops.
- Don't worry about it.

41
00:02:21,427 --> 00:02:23,290
I figure I could get 5 miles
in before bed.

42
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:25,701
You ran this morning,
and you don't run.

43
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,523
Who are you, and what
have you done with Meg?

44
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,483
I am bored.

45
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:31,330
I'm out-of-my-head bored.
I'm running bored.

46
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:33,183
You know what I do all day? Nothing.

47
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:35,822
And after that, nothing,
and then a little more nothing.

48
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:38,590
I mean, what do people do all day
who don't have jobs or kids?

49
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:41,111
'Cause I can't spend all my time
running around the neighborhood.

50
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:44,223
My thighs are killing me.
I'm freaking out here.

51
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:46,641
I know it's frustrating
being in a new place,

52
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:49,493
trying to figure out where you fit in,
But don't run.

53
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,143
- You know, get a job.
- A job?

54
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:56,612
Now why don't we...
hurt your thighs a little more...

55
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,230
In a non-running way?

56
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:06,512
- I'm going home.
- You're not going home.

57
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:07,911
I don't want to... just...

58
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,302
Would you just stop bathing me
like I'm an invalid?

59
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:12,690
You got shot.
You want to be both shot and dirty?

60
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:16,692
I'm serious. I don't want to be your
responsibility. I don't want to be...

61
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:19,782
- I don't want to be a burden.
- You're not a burden.

62
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:23,110
Kevin, look at me.
You're not a burden.

63
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,192
Let me take care of you.

64
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:31,433
Karen was out of her head
with the pain. The blood...

65
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:35,302
She was always spitting up blood.
Her condition was fatal. You know that.

66
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:38,470
And she was begging me to help her,
so I just...

67
00:03:38,648 --> 00:03:40,423
I did. I helped her.

68
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:43,333
All right, Karen was sick for months,
and I know that she was dying,

69
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:46,082
but there were so many other ways
that you could've

70
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:47,693
helped her... palliative care,

71
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:49,960
- pain management.
- She didn't want that.

72
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:52,391
She was done. She just wanted to go.

73
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,413
So you shot her in the head?

74
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:57,252
- Doug is been through a trauma.
- They had a troubled marriage.

75
00:03:57,427 --> 00:04:01,350
He said he was gonna leave her
before I diagnosed her. Karen was...

76
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:03,952
- she was helpless.
- It's not like that.

77
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:05,242
Time to go.

78
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:10,683
I was only trying to help her.

79
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,473
So you're his shrink, and...
who are you?

80
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:17,561
Dr. Bennett is...
was Karen's doctor.

81
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:21,600
Karen was suffering from kidney failure
secondary to wegener's disease.

82
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:22,751
She was sick. I get it.

83
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:25,202
Did he ever talk about hurting his wife,
wanting her dead?

84
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:28,523
- Well, I... when we...
- Well, whatever he said is privileged.

85
00:04:28,695 --> 00:04:31,540
- So you're okay protecting a murderer?
- I'm protecting my patient.

86
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:32,673
What about you, Dr. Bennett?

87
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,943
You gonna stay silent, or are you
gonna protect your patient... Karen?

88
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:37,311
We're leaving.

89
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:56,061
The elevator's mine. You can have the
fourth floor, but the elevator's mine.

90
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,730
I'll give you one more day
to calm yourself down,

91
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:01,932
Then we're gonna discuss this
like grown adults.

92
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:04,030
Tell you what, Charlotte,

93
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,840
go to hell.

94
00:05:08,515 --> 00:05:09,860
My god. He shot her?

95
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:12,163
Wait, he shot her shot her?

96
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:14,560
- As in killed her shot her.
- Killed who?

97
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:17,673
- Doug Adams murdered his wife last night.
- He did not murder her.

98
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:21,532
- He said she begged him to do it.
- Oh, god, that poor man.

99
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:24,122
- That poor woman.
- Then it was a mercy killing?

100
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:27,160
- Dell gets it. It was euthanasia.
- It was a bullet to the brain.

101
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:28,880
Look, I know Doug,

102
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:30,802
- and he is not the type to...
- There is no type.

103
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:34,093
Regular normal people are driven
to murder every day. Right? Love?

104
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:37,861
Love will do it every time.
Twisted, sick, messed up love...

105
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:44,231
- Charlotte king is still alive, right?
- I'm just saying, the impulse...

106
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:45,710
We all have it.

107
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:47,763
I didn't know you were coming here.

108
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:50,022
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure, give me one second.

109
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:51,540
Not you. You.

110
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,203
What did I tell you
about the elevator?

111
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,451
I'm not talking to you.

112
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:13,243
- My day is made.
- I need a favor.

113
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,522
That's rich. You open a practice right
underneath us, and you need a favor from us?

114
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:18,610
I'm not coming to you
from pacific wellcare.

115
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:21,452
As chief at the hospital
where you retain surgical privileges,

116
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,833
- I'm hoping we can be civil.
- What is it?

117
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,163
- Don't engage.
- Breathe. I can be civil.

118
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:28,743
What is it?

119
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:38,452
Full-term pregnancy. Eight months ago,
she was in a car accident.

120
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:41,122
Doctors did everything they could,
but...

121
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:43,963
- She's comatose.
- And in an early labor.

122
00:06:48,318 --> 00:06:50,063
She just... moaned.

123
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:52,501
That's good, right?

124
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:55,940
She hasn't done that since
right after the accident.

125
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:58,880
Moaning is a good sign
that she's starting to respond.

126
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:02,971
- I think it's just a sign of labor.
- Sean, the neurologist told you,

127
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:04,551
She's nonresponsive.

128
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:06,660
She wants this baby so much.

129
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:10,820
We found out she was pregnant
the day before the car accident.

130
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:12,760
I think it was the happiest day
of her life.

131
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:14,212
The baby's in a breech position.

132
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:16,532
Our O.B. tried E.C.V. to try
to turn the baby, but...

133
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:20,590
She's down too low. I need to do
a C-section. You wanna book an o.R.?

134
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:24,402
She needs to go through labor.
She needs to deliver this baby herself.

135
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,570
She can't.

136
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:28,432
The breech position puts the baby
at risk for a prolapsed cord,

137
00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:30,762
Which would cut off
the baby's oxygen supply.

138
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:34,483
The head could get trapped, potentially
causing brain injury or worse.

139
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:38,871
A woman in Kentucky, situation just like
Alena, having the baby, it woke her.

140
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:41,602
Alena needs to deliver this baby

141
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,940
naturally, on her own.
She has to.

142
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:46,020
Alena is going to wake up.

143
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:49,590
And we're gonna be a family again.

144
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:58,632
<i>Private Practice S02E08
Crime and Punishment</i>

145
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:02,951
- He is going to kill his own child.
- He loves her.

146
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:04,494
He sat here every day.

147
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,493
- He wants her back.
- She's not waking up.

148
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:09,060
"Rip van winkle's" a fairy tale.
Don't tell me you're going sentimental.

149
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:10,660
Hardly. Just...

150
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,972
- I find him touching.
- I need to do a C-section.

151
00:08:14,046 --> 00:08:17,052
I need to get the baby out now,
or both mom and baby could die.

152
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:18,183
We can't make him.

153
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:20,603
We can't force him
to let us cut her open.

154
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:24,102
Look, maybe if you talk to him,
get to know him.

155
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,410
He warms up to you,
and then you help him understand...

156
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:28,561
That's your job, Charlotte,
as chief of staff.

157
00:08:28,738 --> 00:08:30,583
My job as consult
is to get the baby out.

158
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:33,343
- I have a practice to get back to.
- So do I.

159
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:38,030
We...

160
00:08:38,847 --> 00:08:41,253
Have to work together
to help that family.

161
00:08:41,478 --> 00:08:43,162
- We do.
- I'll put her on terbutaline

162
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:44,573
to temporarily stop
the contractions,

163
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:46,231
but that'll only get you through
the end of the day.

164
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:47,460
I'll consult legal.

165
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:51,713
See if there's any way we can override
the father and do the "C" without consent.

166
00:08:57,017 --> 00:08:59,330
He could've left, and he didn't.
Why now?

167
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:02,383
She was gonna die in what,
in six weeks, three months?

168
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:05,572
You think after years and years
and years of this marriage,

169
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:09,221
- He would shoot her now?
- They had a volatile relationship,

170
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:13,423
all right? Now you may have seen
his side, but I saw hers. And she...

171
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,401
- she was not suicidal.
- Well, Doug was not homicidal.

172
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:18,341
Except for the gun in his hand.

173
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:20,850
- I don't think it was like that.
- Well...

174
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:24,473
Well, the cops are gonna want
a statement from both of us, and...

175
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,270
I'm gonna tell the truth.

176
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:30,381
Well, if Doug gives me permission
to talk to them, so am I.

177
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:34,273
The actual truth or the truth
that you want to believe?

178
00:09:41,036 --> 00:09:45,113
It's... No, it really...
It's fantastic. I'm serious.

179
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:47,741
- What's going on?
- I like her, Pete.

180
00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:51,382
I went down to the Venice family clinic
today to offer my services.

181
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:54,771
Turns out they have a huge overflow
of patients, but not enough exam rooms,

182
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:57,573
but with NaomI's help,
we found some room here.

183
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:00,833
Here at... Oceanside Wellness?

184
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:03,041
When the clinic has too many patients,
I'll see 'em here.

185
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:06,150
Addison's always talking about how,
with Charlotte's practice opening,

186
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:09,181
We need to expand our community
outreach and raise our profile.

187
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,040
Meg is the perfect liaison. Plus,

188
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:13,571
she's willing to let Dell shadow.

189
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:16,101
Oceanside Wellness gets to generate
possible future income,

190
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:18,553
and I get to avoid going stir crazy.
Everyone wins.

191
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:21,070
- Welcome aboard, Meg.
- Thank you.

192
00:10:25,648 --> 00:10:28,632
All right, I have to go find
Dell and get set up.

193
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:30,471
See you later?

194
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:48,432
Is it always this slow?

195
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:50,542
Only when someone stops it.

196
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:01,013
Are you okay?
You're not claustrophobic, are you?

197
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:03,141
Just impatient and in a bad mood.

198
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:04,952
Anything I can do?

199
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:11,570
Occupational hazard.
I'm a therapist.

200
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:15,651
And to be honest, I'm a bit nervous.
Interviewing for a new job, you know?

201
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:19,292
- On the fourth floor?
- Yes, you work there?

202
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:22,372
- No. I pushed 5, remember?
- Right.

203
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,551
Well, if you need to talk,

204
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:26,181
- if there's anything I can do.
- You know, I'm a shrink, too.

205
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:27,913
I think I can handle it.

206
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:32,630
I'm Shel...

207
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:35,061
I'm Sheldon Wallace.

208
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,520
Is there anything else you need?

209
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:43,190
This is perfect.
Better than I'm used to.

210
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:45,711
- Can I just say, Dr. Porter, that...
- Meg, please.

211
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:47,833
I just know I'm gonna learn so much
working with you.

212
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,771
Well, I bet you could teach me
a few things, too.

213
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:51,581
Candy stash... under the microwave.

214
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:54,013
See? That's critical information.

215
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:57,713
Well, Dell, it looks like our first
patient together is Renee Olsen.

216
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:11,461
I was referred to Dr. Porter for...

217
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:14,422
- termination.
- I'm sorry?

218
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:15,923
Termination.

219
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:17,810
Abortion?

220
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:20,091
It's not like I don't want her here.
I just don't...

221
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:20,941
Want her here.

222
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,740
She just did it.
She didn't even ask me.

223
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:23,812
Welcome to my world.

224
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,062
It's not like she
went behind my back.

225
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:26,742
- She just...
- Went behind your back.

226
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:29,503
Stop finishing my sentences.
You know, she's a good doctor.

227
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:30,631
She's gonna be fine.

228
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:33,602
Did anybody know
Meg was gonna be doing abortions?

229
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:35,713
Look, I know I'm not a partner
in this practice,

230
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:36,923
and you guys might all be
okay with this,

231
00:12:37,018 --> 00:12:38,461
but I want to go on the record
for saying that I'm not.

232
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:40,950
- Not okay with what?
- Meg working here.

233
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:43,561
Nai told me. Pro bono clinic.
I think it's great.

234
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:45,802
- She's doing abortions.
- And?

235
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,953
Wait, you men have
a problem with it?

236
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:51,231
Not as men.

237
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,020
- We respect the choice, but...
- I don't.

238
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,113
- I'm not commenting.
- We just didn't know.

239
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:58,543
- You didn't know what?
- Meg's doing abortions here.

240
00:12:58,717 --> 00:12:59,730
She's what?

241
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:04,182
Nice digs you got in those exam rooms.
They're palatial compared to grass huts.

242
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:06,042
What?

243
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:08,391
You should've told us you were gonna
be doing abortions. That's all.

244
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:12,493
Everybody without a vagina, leave the
room unless you want to fight with me.

245
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:19,271
- This is a problem?
- I run a fertility clinic.

246
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:21,621
And I'm in the business
of helping women to get pregnant,

247
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:22,760
- Not...
- Wait.

248
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,512
Abortion is legal in the United States
of America, Naomi.

249
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:26,473
Are you against choice?

250
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:29,543
I am not gonna argue Roe V. Wade
with you. I am just saying,

251
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:31,901
they have never been done here
and they should never be done here.

252
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:34,413
It's a valid medical procedure
for women in need.

253
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:37,002
Not for me,
and not for this practice.

254
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:39,202
I'm sorry....

255
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:41,123
I have to run.

256
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,772
I don't have a problem with it.

257
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:45,552
We said she could work here.
She can work here.

258
00:13:57,258 --> 00:13:59,541
- I'm ready for Renee.
- She's gone.

259
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:01,341
What? Where?

260
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:04,392
I don't know where.
I just know that she's not coming back.

261
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:06,672
Well, what happened? Is she okay?

262
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:09,221
Except for the part about her planning
to kill her baby.

263
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:12,332
- You talked her out of it?
- I just told her what I thought, okay?

264
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:13,823
I have work to do.

265
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:24,722
I got a message that you're ready
for me to do the C-section.

266
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:26,380
I told you no. I meant no.

267
00:14:26,556 --> 00:14:29,441
- We want you to do the C-section.
- These are Alena's parents.

268
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:31,670
I called them after I had legal
do some checking.

269
00:14:31,845 --> 00:14:33,962
Turns out Sean and Alena
are not married.

270
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:36,322
He has no right to make decisions
on her behalf.

271
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:39,140
We were gonna get married right after
we found out about the baby.

272
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:42,631
I mean, just because we didn't...
I am still family.

273
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:44,712
Don't you think we want her back?

274
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:46,003
But she's not waking up.

275
00:14:46,096 --> 00:14:49,702
If you need to do a C-section
to help the baby, then do it.

276
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,312
The parents have
the legal authority.

277
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,111
I will schedule a C-section
for this afternoon.

278
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:10,431
Dell shamed a young woman
for wanting an abortion.

279
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:13,680
You offered abortions to patients
without consulting anyone else.

280
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:16,551
I'm a doctor. I don't need to consult
anyone about my medical care.

281
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:19,252
You're a doctor who's working with
six other doctors who have

282
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,212
opinions about cases and about
the reputation of their practice.

283
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:25,222
I'm screwing up your reputation?
That's what this is about?

284
00:15:25,396 --> 00:15:27,500
You completely disregarded
everyone else who works here.

285
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:31,161
So, yes, that does reflect on me.
This is my domain.

286
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:32,671
Fine. I'll go.

287
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:49,613
It's off.

288
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,190
Baby daddy went to court to get an
injunction as guardian over the baby.

289
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:55,362
- Not gonna be any surgery, not today.
- What?

290
00:15:55,535 --> 00:15:58,382
No, the patient is prepped
and ready to go. Damn it.

291
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,960
- So what next?
- I'll see if I can convince a judge to

292
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:06,141
get over here and clear this up.

293
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:08,201
If the baby lives long enough.

294
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:11,363
- Can I ask you?
- What?

295
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:15,031
You betrayed him.

296
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:17,092
So how long is he gonna make me pay
for my crime?

297
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,181
He's angry.
I don't see that ending anytime soon.

298
00:16:26,348 --> 00:16:29,950
- You're in love with him.
- I am not. I just...

299
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:32,633
I am not.

300
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:38,301
This doesn't make us friends. We're not
friends. Don't go getting any ideas.

301
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:41,001
I have no intention
of being friends with you.

302
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:50,371
They're saying I murdered her.
I didn't. I helped end her pain.

303
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:53,270
Sam says... he thinks...

304
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,110
When was the last time Sam saw her,
two weeks ago?

305
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:58,431
And for what, maybe half an hour?

306
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:00,301
He didn't see

307
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:03,673
how walking up a flight of stairs
got to be more than she could take.

308
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:08,572
I did. I had to listen to her moan
in pain when the drugs wore off

309
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:12,681
and panic 'cause I thought maybe
she had died from a nosebleed.

310
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:16,163
- Well, there were other options.
- I did what she wanted.

311
00:17:16,658 --> 00:17:17,653
Look...

312
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:22,132
I know Karen and I
had a lousy marriage.

313
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:25,052
I don't even know
if I loved her by the end.

314
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,410
But I did care about her.

315
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,231
I just wish you had called me first.
We could've talked about it.

316
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:38,382
My lawyer says they're going for
first-degree murder. I can't...

317
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,553
do you know what it's like in here?

318
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:42,721
Please.

319
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:45,390
Please help me.

320
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:48,513
I waive all privilege.

321
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,613
Whatever it takes. Just tell them.
Tell the police...

322
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:55,240
Tell them I didn't murder her.

323
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,081
You know me.

324
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,140
Do you think I murdered her?

325
00:18:32,206 --> 00:18:33,333
Is it true that Pete
found out that Meg

326
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:34,812
was doing abortions
and asked her to leave?

327
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,693
- Not exactly.
- 'Cause if that is true,

328
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:39,260
- that is ridiculous.
- What, Pete asking her to leave,

329
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:41,082
or doing the abortions?

330
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:45,220
Well, don't tell me you have a problem
with Meg doing the abortions.

331
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:46,680
- What?
- I spend all day every day

332
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:48,422
trying to help women
make babies who...

333
00:18:48,506 --> 00:18:50,292
who stopped believing that
they ever could.

334
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:52,731
I can't believe this is such
an issue for you.

335
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:56,560
I... wish that I had known
a doctor like Meg

336
00:18:56,657 --> 00:19:00,373
or a place like our practice
when I needed an abortion.

337
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:03,640
I had two.

338
00:19:04,537 --> 00:19:05,853
I had a very...

339
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:07,933
misspent youth.

340
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:09,711
I made some mistakes.

341
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:12,591
- You don't have to tell us.
- I wasn't going to,

342
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:15,153
- but I'm not ashamed.
- I was.

343
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:17,420
I had one.

344
00:19:17,596 --> 00:19:20,490
And I was embarrassed and scared.

345
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:24,462
I was everything
a woman shouldn't be.

346
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:30,833
Well, I fertilize eggs every day, and I
believe that life begins at conception.

347
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:33,132
- So what, it's murder?
- I believe what I believe.

348
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:34,982
Well, I believe that things
aren't so black-and-white.

349
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:36,182
Well, you know,
you don't do what I do.

350
00:19:36,356 --> 00:19:37,390
I deal with the aftermath.

351
00:19:37,488 --> 00:19:39,540
I deal with women who've had children
who shouldn't have.

352
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,373
Maybe we should talk
about something else.

353
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:56,732
What are you doing here?

354
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:00,141
I just

355
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:03,330
thought y might be in the mood for
a drink after a hard day at the office.

356
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:04,642
No, thanks.

357
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,361
Get out from in front of my door.

358
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:13,283
Move.

359
00:20:20,726 --> 00:20:22,241
I'm sorry, okay?

360
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:24,473
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:29,073
I'll do the time.
Whatever you want,

362
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:30,792
I'll do the time.

363
00:20:31,555 --> 00:20:32,862
But I am sorry.

364
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:34,610
Just...

365
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:36,502
go home.

366
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,010
I need time...

367
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:05,962
to think.

368
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:09,250
So I thought in my
hotel room with the

369
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:10,852
crisp white sheets and the

370
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:12,931
- travel-Sized toiletries.
- You didn't have to do that.

371
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:17,053
You have two modes... off and on...
and when you're off...

372
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:19,622
Peter, you get cold.

373
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:21,980
You're closed, you're shut down.
It's like you're

374
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,863
punishing me for something
that I didn't do.

375
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:28,332
You never used to be like this.
The man I knew...

376
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:31,071
we used to share everything.

377
00:21:34,286 --> 00:21:35,502
So what happened?

378
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:38,091
What happened to you
between then and now?

379
00:21:40,838 --> 00:21:43,940
The clinic is good.
What you do for people is good.

380
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:46,210
I overreacted.

381
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:50,273
Come back.

382
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,481
Good morning.

383
00:22:02,657 --> 00:22:06,831
Not so good. The district attorney's
gonna subpoena Karen's medical records.

384
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:07,500
You okay?

385
00:22:07,677 --> 00:22:09,561
I was up all night
trying to figure this out.

386
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:12,803
And I cannot get the image of Doug with
that gun in his hand out of my head.

387
00:22:13,008 --> 00:22:15,382
So then you do think
it's possible that...

388
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:17,513
I don'know. No.
I just...

389
00:22:17,928 --> 00:22:19,272
I wish there was somebody

390
00:22:19,445 --> 00:22:22,732
I could talk to, somebody who knows
about this kind of thing. I'm kind of in

391
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,533
uncharted waters here.

392
00:22:26,238 --> 00:22:29,303
I think I know someone
you could talk to.

393
00:22:33,445 --> 00:22:34,490
Sit down.

394
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:39,813
Sorry. I don't mean to bother
you while you're recovering.

395
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:41,710
Please... bother me.

396
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:45,343
So... Doug Adams killed his wife.

397
00:22:45,928 --> 00:22:49,073
How do I know if it's murder
or assisted suicide?

398
00:22:49,246 --> 00:22:53,203
Doug has had no difficulty with impul-
sivity or anger control his entire life.

399
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:55,333
He was submissive to his wife.

400
00:22:55,698 --> 00:22:59,582
I've never found any indication
that he was remotely violent.

401
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:03,161
In fact, I would be hard-pressed
to concoct a scenario

402
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,823
In which he had the temerity
to strike out against his wife

403
00:23:05,997 --> 00:23:07,730
unless she instructed him.

404
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:11,100
You don't think he got scared to leave
and took the easy way out?

405
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:14,211
Killing Karen would never be
the easy way out for him.

406
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:20,200
I just don't think Doug
murdered his wife in cold blood.

407
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:23,933
In all my years on the force, do you know
how many women I've seen kill themselves

408
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,971
or asked to killed with a gun?

409
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:27,911
None.

410
00:23:32,665 --> 00:23:34,853
What's best for the child
is to have a mother.

411
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,831
What's best for
the child is to be alive.

412
00:23:36,945 --> 00:23:38,193
I will not hear shouting.

413
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:40,133
You want me to defer
this to the courtroom?

414
00:23:40,356 --> 00:23:44,131
We can put the attorneys together and
have'em drag it out until it's too late.

415
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:46,013
I want to hear from you.

416
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:48,903
The baby's in imminent danger.
If I do nothing,

417
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,310
it could suffer
irreversible complications.

418
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:53,090
And the hospital's position?

419
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,883
You support dr. Montgomery?

420
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:56,962
We want to give Alena every chance.

421
00:23:57,267 --> 00:24:00,223
That said, judge,
we don't dispute dr. Montgomery.

422
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:01,871
It is her only chance.

423
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:07,942
Alena is our daughter. If we thought
for one minute we could have her back...

424
00:24:08,818 --> 00:24:10,701
I have two choices, Sean.

425
00:24:10,877 --> 00:24:14,620
I can rule on this,
Or you can withdraw your objection.

426
00:24:14,797 --> 00:24:17,033
I'd rather it come from you.

427
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:29,963
- You look like you're in a hurry.
- Thanks.

428
00:24:32,857 --> 00:24:34,601
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

429
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:36,603
Ah, we all have bad days.?

430
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:39,281
Today any better

431
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,853
Actually, no.

432
00:24:42,098 --> 00:24:45,053
- I don't suppose you want to talk about it.
- Yeah, it's complicated.

433
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:46,820
Transference?

434
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:48,610
Psychosis?

435
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:50,592
I'm kidding.

436
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:52,252
Murder.

437
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,970
Or manslaughter.

438
00:24:54,815 --> 00:24:56,042
That's... big.

439
00:24:57,138 --> 00:24:58,522
You must be good.

440
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:00,460
You'd think.

441
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,020
You know the best way
to cheer yourself up?

442
00:25:04,785 --> 00:25:06,961
- Cheer someone else up.
- Oh, is...

443
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,072
is that your brand of therapy?

444
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:11,740
What is that, Jung or Freud, or,

445
00:25:11,796 --> 00:25:14,103
- or fortune cookies?
- It's Mark Twain, actually.

446
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,220
You like Twain?

447
00:25:17,227 --> 00:25:20,063
You see? There you are.
You've cheered me up.

448
00:25:20,707 --> 00:25:23,693
People who like Twain
always cheer me up.

449
00:25:26,828 --> 00:25:28,162
Did you get the job?

450
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:29,781
I got the job.

451
00:25:36,596 --> 00:25:38,783
- We need to talk about renee.
- I'm busy.

452
00:25:39,628 --> 00:25:41,622
We work really hard
to create babies here.

453
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,653
We are in the business of
bringing babies into this world.

454
00:25:47,898 --> 00:25:49,421
I don't know you very well.

455
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:51,742
I certainly don't know you
well enough to judge you

456
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:54,413
for this. But you don't know
Renee very well,

457
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,252
Yet you were quick to judge her.

458
00:25:57,928 --> 00:25:59,270
What... Was she raped?

459
00:25:59,445 --> 00:26:01,713
Would it matter if she was?
Would that make it okay?

460
00:26:01,888 --> 00:26:04,040
I mean, does that make her
more or less worthy?

461
00:26:04,976 --> 00:26:06,502
We don't get to know why.

462
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:08,741
That is her business.
That's her choice, Dell.

463
00:26:09,216 --> 00:26:11,903
That woman agonized
over a difficult choice,

464
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,691
Made it and came in here.

465
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:16,922
I guarantee you she was already worried
about people out there judging her

466
00:26:17,095 --> 00:26:19,060
only to have you
make her feel ashamed.

467
00:26:19,187 --> 00:26:20,792
But we are medical professionals.

468
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,672
It is part of our job to support her
once she has made

469
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,590
the hardest choice imaginable.

470
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:38,673
- You're not allowed down here, sean.
- I know. I... look, I just... I can't...

471
00:26:41,928 --> 00:26:43,123
I made her laugh.

472
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:47,243
I made her laugh, and she looked
away from the road and...

473
00:26:49,046 --> 00:26:51,801
I caused it.
I was responsible for her coma.

474
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:54,861
I don't want to be responsible
for her staying like this.

475
00:26:55,187 --> 00:26:57,092
Please,
I know what the judge said...

476
00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:01,851
I need a miracle here.

477
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:05,623
I'm asking for a miracle.

478
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:08,003
You have to stop punishing yourself.

479
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:11,452
Sean, you didn't make
that accident happen.

480
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:13,273
And you don't make miracles happen.

481
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,211
But I do.

482
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,980
I'm about to go in there
and deliver your miracle, Sean.

483
00:27:19,335 --> 00:27:22,230
And I know that this isn't
the path that you sought out

484
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:25,062
Or the one that you and
Alena saw for yourselves.

485
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,322
But this is your baby,

486
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:31,022
the baby that alena wanted, and the one
that she would want you to raise.

487
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:34,500
So I'm gonna go in that O.R.
and I'm gonna bring out that miracle.

488
00:27:44,757 --> 00:27:46,622
Did you talk to the d. A.?

489
00:27:46,797 --> 00:27:49,482
- What did he say?
- You know, I didn't talk to him yet.

490
00:27:49,828 --> 00:27:51,541
I wanted to talk to you more.

491
00:27:52,615 --> 00:27:54,643
I was worried about you...
Here...

492
00:27:55,605 --> 00:27:57,531
Thinking about what you did,

493
00:27:58,148 --> 00:27:59,753
What you had to do.

494
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:03,930
It must have been awful.

495
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:06,171
It was.

496
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:08,103
To do that to someone you loved

497
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:11,803
And to have her ask for that...

498
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:15,001
For her to ask you to use a gun...

499
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:17,670
Karen wanted it to be quick.

500
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:21,253
She was afraid
That something else wouldn't work.

501
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:28,432
- She was just in so much pain and...
- I know all about her pain, Doug.

502
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:33,542
But what about your pain?
I want to know about your pain.

503
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:43,300
- Come here.
- You're antiabortion.

504
00:28:44,435 --> 00:28:45,430
I am.

505
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:47,470
Unapologetically.

506
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:50,721
Do you think it makes a difference why
a woman would want to have an abortion,

507
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:54,302
- Like rape or...
- I think it matters why it bothers you.

508
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:55,982
What do you mean?

509
00:28:56,156 --> 00:29:00,013
If you're against it for religious beliefs
or personal beliefs, that's one thing.

510
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:04,602
God or something in your soul
is trying to tell you something.

511
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:08,833
I refused to even learn how to perform
the procedure in medical school.

512
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:11,873
I couldn't. I just... I couldn't.

513
00:29:12,676 --> 00:29:15,913
But if abortion bothers you
for other reasons...

514
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:18,390
What?

515
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:21,782
Look, I don't want to be responsible
for swaying you to the other side.

516
00:29:24,705 --> 00:29:29,630
Did your child's mother,
did she consider having an abortion?

517
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,103
You tried to talk
her into getting one.

518
00:29:41,538 --> 00:29:45,491
And now you look into your daughter's
beautiful face, and you feel guilty.

519
00:29:51,435 --> 00:29:54,871
We went to the clinic,
and she wouldn't get out of the car

520
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:57,383
And I yelled at her.

521
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:02,001
I yelled at her, and,
you know, now I just...

522
00:30:03,828 --> 00:30:06,241
I just can't believe
I yelled at her.

523
00:30:11,627 --> 00:30:15,923
Then I think you are not
against a woman's right to choose.

524
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,813
You're just punishing yourself
for the choice you almost made.

525
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:29,543
- I've told you everything.
- You released her.

526
00:30:30,918 --> 00:30:33,083
You gave her everything she wanted.

527
00:30:33,395 --> 00:30:35,982
So you should feel like
a weight has been lifted.

528
00:30:37,246 --> 00:30:38,891
But you don't, do you?

529
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:41,132
It's hard to feel that way
when I'm in here.

530
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:42,401
It must've been hard...

531
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,023
Her in pain, yelling at you,

532
00:30:47,508 --> 00:30:52,341
Wanting you to help her. She made you
feel awful every day of your life,

533
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:56,273
So you must have thought that by
helping her, the pain would go away.

534
00:30:58,266 --> 00:30:59,323
But it hasn't

535
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:02,921
Because the truth is
still eating away at you.

536
00:31:04,005 --> 00:31:05,610
I couldn't take it anymore.

537
00:31:07,477 --> 00:31:11,231
You need to let it go, Doug.
Just let it go.

538
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:15,863
She kept... yelling at me...

539
00:31:17,468 --> 00:31:19,271
For me to do things for her.

540
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:24,220
She would say things to hurt me.

541
00:31:24,775 --> 00:31:28,282
She would lie in that bed
and throw things at me

542
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:33,072
And call me an idiot and a weakling and
tell me everything I was doing was wrong

543
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:36,101
When all I wanted
to do was help her.

544
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:38,981
And the more she would yell,
the more she would bleed.

545
00:31:39,318 --> 00:31:42,762
And there was blood everywhere,
And I couldn't take her

546
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:45,030
and I couldn't take the blood,
And...

547
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:48,043
and I stopped feeling sorry for her.
And...

548
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:50,562
And all I thought about
Was that I should have left her,

549
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:54,070
But I couldn't leave her now. I couldn't
just walk out the door, but I couldn't stay.

550
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:57,891
I couldn't hear her yell anymore.

551
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:00,782
I couldn't hear it.

552
00:32:02,198 --> 00:32:03,930
So I took the gun...

553
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:06,552
And I stopped it.

554
00:32:09,256 --> 00:32:10,591
I stopped her.

555
00:32:13,837 --> 00:32:15,071
You murdered her.

556
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:18,741
I put her out of her misery.

557
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:22,262
You put yourself out of your misery.

558
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:35,880
- I tried calling.
- I know I got your message.

559
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:38,540
I am so sorry for
the way you were treated.

560
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:42,793
Dell was out of line,
and I apologize. I'm just

561
00:32:43,075 --> 00:32:46,381
- glad you didn't ignore my message.
- Well, I did ignore it. I mean,

562
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:49,270
I listened to it,
But I wasn't going to come back.

563
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:52,300
- Well, I don't understand. Why are you
- Dell called me.

564
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:09,412
Oceanside wellness performs
its first abortion. Wonderful.

565
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,303
- She's throwing multiple p.V.C.S.
- Bolus her with 100 of lido

566
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:17,690
And start a 2-Milligram-Per-Minute
drip. Lap pad.

567
00:33:17,987 --> 00:33:19,780
Lost her pressure. V-Fib.

568
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:22,211
She's going into cardiac
arrest. Get a crash cart.

569
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:25,320
She's throwing an embolus.
Start C.P.R. Epi.5.

570
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:26,871
Let's go. The baby?

571
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:28,872
Got her.

572
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:35,843
Charge to 200.

573
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:38,171
Clear.

574
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:01,123
Okay. You ready?
You ready to see daddy?

575
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:04,850
She's beautiful.

576
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,093
She has your nose...

577
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:15,393
- And Alena's eyes.
- I'm so... So sorry for your loss.

578
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:34,443
I'm afraid you can't.

579
00:34:35,305 --> 00:34:37,083
It's against hospital regulations.

580
00:34:37,256 --> 00:34:39,422
I want her to meet her mother,

581
00:34:41,316 --> 00:34:42,841
And I want to say good-bye.

582
00:35:19,538 --> 00:35:20,860
This is our daughter.

583
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:25,050
Look what we made.

584
00:35:55,058 --> 00:35:59,392
I don't know if you hear this
a lot from us, but...

585
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:01,843
Thank you.

586
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:14,722
I hope you know she made
The best decision she could for herself.

587
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:19,163
I just always thought medicine
was going to be about helping people.

588
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:20,790
It is.

589
00:36:30,008 --> 00:36:34,691
I'm proud of you for doing what you
thought was right, but I just can't.

590
00:36:34,768 --> 00:36:35,762
Not now.

591
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:45,113
We're on the same time schedule.

592
00:36:48,028 --> 00:36:50,060
- Can I ask your professional advice?
- Sure.

593
00:36:50,736 --> 00:36:52,303
Step into my office.

594
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,903
Well... let's say you have a client,

595
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:02,653
And this client
has been through hell.

596
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:06,083
And it's a client that you like,
You really like.

597
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:09,572
And they've done something...

598
00:37:11,015 --> 00:37:12,010
wrong.

599
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,760
Or maybe they've done something right
For the wrong reasons...

600
00:37:18,158 --> 00:37:19,973
I'm not making any sense, am i?

601
00:37:21,226 --> 00:37:22,492
Did anyone get hurt?

602
00:37:25,147 --> 00:37:27,862
You have your answer...
Don't you?

603
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:35,690
I'm...
I'm Violet.

604
00:37:36,286 --> 00:37:37,460
Violet turner.

605
00:37:50,745 --> 00:37:53,680
You asked what happened to me
Between then and now.

606
00:37:58,097 --> 00:38:00,473
I have a dead wife that I hated...

607
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,490
Hated...

608
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:05,581
Until the moment she was gone.

609
00:38:08,008 --> 00:38:09,651
And if I could...

610
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:14,691
Take back the hate...

611
00:38:18,808 --> 00:38:20,781
It killed a piece of me.

612
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:26,300
There's a piece of me that no
longer exists because of her.

613
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:29,851
- So when you feel threatened...
- There are very few women that I trust.

614
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:31,560
You trust the women here...

615
00:38:35,268 --> 00:38:37,192
I'm doing the best I can, okay?

616
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:45,310
He's going to prison
for a very, very, very long time.

617
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:48,662
Poor Karen.

618
00:38:50,058 --> 00:38:52,760
I feel so guilty that
I ever believed in him.

619
00:38:54,307 --> 00:38:55,970
Are you at all religious?

620
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:02,400
In church,

621
00:39:03,757 --> 00:39:05,341
when someone dies...

622
00:39:08,077 --> 00:39:10,870
We light a candle to rember them.

623
00:39:33,195 --> 00:39:34,640
What are we doing?

624
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:38,563
Trying to forgive ourselves.

625
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:43,212
Can I get in on that?

626
00:40:15,775 --> 00:40:17,191
A baby died today.

627
00:40:43,896 --> 00:40:44,892
Long day?

628
00:40:46,137 --> 00:40:48,741
Let me make you something to eat.
You must be starving.

629
00:40:49,186 --> 00:40:52,611
You took care of me.
Now let me take care of you.

630
00:41:01,507 --> 00:41:02,500
I'm fine.

631
00:41:06,345 --> 00:41:08,192
I made a miracle today.

632
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:12,803
I'm fine.

633
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:18,380
I'm fine.
