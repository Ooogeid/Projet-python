1
00:00:05,284 --> 00:00:07,383
I feel like I've been through a war.

2
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:09,270
Parasites... My brother,

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,933
had parasites in his brain, and...

4
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:14,349
Epic, epic war

5
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:17,164
I know but the good news is
that we won.

6
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:19,493
Archer is nearly himself again.

7
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:20,663
Nearly?

8
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,147
What? something wrong?

9
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:25,745
God no! No...
Everything is fine.

10
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:27,050
All parts are working.

11
00:00:27,112 --> 00:00:29,622
- Okay, my brother my brother....
- Sorry.

12
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:31,421
It's just that it's...

13
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:34,154
It's good. Really good.

14
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:35,833
- Yeah?
- I...

15
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:37,940
I think he's my boyfriend.

16
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:39,842
He sleeps over every night

17
00:00:39,908 --> 00:00:43,501
and he calls constantly.
He's been talking lately Addison.

18
00:00:44,096 --> 00:00:45,752
I think I have a man.

19
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:49,561
Archer is comitting.

20
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:53,253
I'm getting another bottle of wine

21
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:54,572
Yes please.

22
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,560
Archer! What do you...

23
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:10,923
Is this your wife?
Are you married?

24
00:01:11,048 --> 00:01:11,833
But...

25
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:14,431
He has a girlfriend.
Who is here.

26
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:15,593
Damn it!

27
00:01:16,538 --> 00:01:19,831
I'm sure you're a very nice person, but
maybe a little bit old to get filled up on the doorway

28
00:01:19,898 --> 00:01:22,622
but now it's all the best.
Good bye.

29
00:01:23,827 --> 00:01:24,620
You...

30
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:27,633
You've got to get the lipstick
off of your face

31
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,422
This is pre or post sex?

32
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:33,253
I hope you used a condomn
you ****

33
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:37,342
I'm in trouble right?

34
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,052
Hey Dell, can I call...

35
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:43,111
Yeah, is she...

36
00:01:43,397 --> 00:01:44,340
she okay?

37
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:49,192
Great, I'll be right there, thanks bye

38
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,852
Addison, anything to eat?

39
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:53,273
Hi, I'm edible.

40
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:55,642
What are you doing here?
Hi

41
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:58,973
Okay you two, you just
do whatever...

42
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:01,391
the two of you do.
I gotta go

43
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:13,001
Come on... Bare down.
One more big push.

44
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:15,673
It's a fast labor, I'm sorry
I thought I could be doing it solo.

45
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:18,132
You're doing great.
Come on Lea you're almost there.

46
00:02:21,297 --> 00:02:23,563
- I can see his head.
- All right, the baby is coming.

47
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,292
Come on Lea! Come on!

48
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:29,462
Got it.

49
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:33,151
Matthew. He's here.

50
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:39,742
I want to hold him.
I want my little boy.

51
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:44,492
What's wrong?

52
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:47,741
- It's not a boy.
- What... ultrasound was wrong?

53
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:49,012
It's a girl?

54
00:02:49,758 --> 00:02:51,002
I'm not sure.

55
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:59,381
<i>Private Practice S02E17
Wait and See<i>

56
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:03,051
I know this is impossibly hard

57
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:04,523
and we don't have

58
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:06,541
all the answers yet, but

59
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:09,240
your baby have something like a penis,

60
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:10,782
There's also a vaginal opening

61
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:13,562
The baby's heart and lungs
and brain are very healthy

62
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,860
and that's important for you
to understand

63
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:17,262
But what is it?

64
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:19,851
We'll run some genetic
and hormonal tests

65
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:23,472
I consult with my collegue Dr Bennet
she's an excellent endocrinologist.

66
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:26,390
- We're gonna get you answers.
- Well, until then...

67
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:28,501
what do we tell people?

68
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,221
What are we...
What are we call him?

69
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:34,003
He's Mathew... He's...
He's supposed to be...

70
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:37,741
he's supposed to be Mathew.

71
00:03:43,078 --> 00:03:44,953
Why did you go to Seattle?

72
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:50,010
I'm sorry. It's just...
it's running through my mind on a loop

73
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:53,000
like a song I can't stop humming,
so I have to ask.

74
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,272
Seattle.

75
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:56,791
- Why did you go?
- Archer's surgery.

76
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:59,832
Look, Naomi likes to pretend
like she has it all together,

77
00:03:59,897 --> 00:04:02,371
Well she's an Ivy league
educated doctor with...

78
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:04,251
the best shoe collection I've ever seen

79
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:07,091
- so she does have it all together
- Usually, but...

80
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,920
Archer getting sick,

81
00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:12,863
In fact, she need a shoulder to lean on.

82
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:18,900
Is it?

83
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,273
I think it's great.

84
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:24,413
You've managed the impossible

85
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:27,991
You've maintain
a good relationship with your ex.

86
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:30,653
It's just why I like you.

87
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:32,312
I like you too.

88
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:36,091
- You're not a good guy.
- Yes, I am.

89
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,671
I was wondering, I run a
couple's therapy group and

90
00:04:52,718 --> 00:04:55,343
my co-leader's down
with a stomach bug and

91
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:57,772
I think it's very important
that we have a male and,

92
00:04:57,837 --> 00:04:59,212
a female therapist

93
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:01,920
You know... Role modeling
Communication modeling

94
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:04,650
and... I wondered if you'd like to

95
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:05,602
fill in.

96
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:08,051
I know, not such a great idea
considering

97
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:12,083
No, no, I... I think it's good.
I like working with couples.

98
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,230
Are you sure?

99
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:15,751
- What time?
- Our conference room, at one

100
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,740
- Lunch time
- Okay, see you then

101
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:23,831
How is it?
the baby?

102
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:25,482
- It's fine.
- Good.

103
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:27,683
That's good that it's fine because...

104
00:05:27,957 --> 00:05:29,733
I would really apreciate

105
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:34,043
if we didn't talk about this right now,
because I don't know if I can handle it.

106
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:37,051
I'll see you later

107
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:50,341
Oh, you've got that look that "it's
impossible to decide for Violet" look.

108
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:53,202
Look, I've just given up.
I'm going cool.

109
00:05:53,325 --> 00:05:56,470
Not cold, just cool
The hell of it with cold.

110
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:58,463
Therapy should be interesting.

111
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:00,963
You and Violet
are in therapy?

112
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:04,102
No we're doing therapy,
together, it's a...

113
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:06,082
- couple's group.
- You're leading it?

114
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:08,703
- As a couple?
- Yes, we are.

115
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:10,441
Good luck with that.

116
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:18,140
You should have seen the look
on their faces, it was awfull.

117
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:19,950
like this is their fault

118
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,330
Are you okay?

119
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,181
No, what...

120
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,032
What do we tell them?

121
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:28,463
Well, I...
wish I had a good answer,

122
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:31,490
but the baby does have 11 beta
hydroxylase deficiency

123
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:34,120
- What is it?
- It is an enzime deficiency

124
00:06:34,205 --> 00:06:37,650
that causes an over production
of testosterone in the baby in-utero

125
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:40,772
That's why the baby has
both male and female sex organ.

126
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:43,103
- The caryotype is XX
- So the baby is a girl?

127
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:47,042
No, it's not that simple.
Yes, genetically, it is a girl, but...

128
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:49,983
30% of these cases, these kids
orient towards male.

129
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:52,013
So we can't tell the parents
what sex the baby is?

130
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,322
Well, they have to choose and then we
can surgically correct the genitalia.

131
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:57,363
You just said there is
a 30% margin for error

132
00:06:57,415 --> 00:07:00,693
Post-op, the healing is faster
and it leaves the genitelia functional.

133
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,363
All, suported with hormon therapy.

134
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,982
But what if they choose wrong
and the baby oriented the other way?

135
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:08,480
Exactly, we shouldn't have them choose
the gender now, but not do surgery.

136
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:10,523
Let them raise
the baby as a boy or a girl

137
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:13,013
and then when the baby becomes
an adolescent, he'll make up

138
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:14,682
- its own mind.
- That's the problem.

139
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:15,871
Living in an it.

140
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,922
everyry sleep over, every swim party or
lockroom is gonna be a cause for panic

141
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,190
Maybe it should be, whatever it is
and not what everybody wants it to be.

142
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:24,950
While I was out,
I've been missing all the fun.

143
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:26,380
Half and half body parts.

144
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:29,182
- Inter-sex baby.
- Kinda like worms.

145
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,211
Some people think gender is hardwired.

146
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:35,014
So what do we do? It's not
gonna change the outcome.

147
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:35,970
Me, I found that freakish
but I'm a boy.

148
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:39,680
- How was your first day back?
- It's perfect now

149
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:54,421
Good morning dr King

150
00:07:56,238 --> 00:07:57,851
Move in with me Cooper.

151
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:02,783
I know you care about
Violet and the baby,

152
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:05,941
and I understand
why you wanted to move in with her.

153
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:07,970
But you can still be there for both of them,

154
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:09,763
without living at her place.

155
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:11,870
Violet is afraid to be alone.

156
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:14,231
-So I need to be there for her.
- I'm your girlfriend.

157
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:15,483
And I'm here for you

158
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:17,550
and living with Violet...

159
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:18,992
doesn't change that.

160
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:23,872
My patience only gets so far.

161
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,083
He's a boy, but...

162
00:08:28,787 --> 00:08:29,942
it could also be a girl.

163
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:31,272
My god.

164
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,120
What are we supposed to do?
How do we decide?

165
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:36,411
Well, the odds say that your baby will

166
00:08:36,488 --> 00:08:37,933
most likely identify as a female

167
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:39,931
so we can do corrective surgery

168
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:42,460
and give the baby
the appropriate genitalia.

169
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:45,193
You want to take my baby, my son,
and cut off of his penis.

170
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:47,602
Alternately you can
choose the gender now

171
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:50,643
raise the baby and then
when he or she matures

172
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:51,792
you reevaluate.

173
00:08:51,826 --> 00:08:53,590
And hide this for his entire childhood?

174
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:57,440
What do we tell him? How do we even
begin to explain this to a little kid?

175
00:08:57,486 --> 00:09:01,013
But that... not everybody the same,
that is okay to be different

176
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:02,260
It's not okay.

177
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,651
kids are cruel

178
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,431
one kid sees him in the bathroom
everyone's talking and tease him

179
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:08,492
and that... that's what kids do.

180
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:11,621
- that's not the life we want
- we need to make this right

181
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:15,291
We need to put this behind us
behind him or her

182
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:17,033
and make it right.

183
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,201
What's the best way?

184
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:28,540
I like women.
I like a lot of women.

185
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,880
but I am not married to Naomi, and
she is not the mother of my children.

186
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:34,083
Naomi sat by your side
while you had surgery,

187
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:36,960
she held your hand. You, upstairs,
sticking your tongue down her throat,

188
00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:38,663
seeing her every day, letting

189
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,921
her believe that you two
have something together...

190
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,222
- I thought I was dying.
- You are...

191
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:46,553
you are asking me to lie for you.

192
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:48,421
you are making me feel dirty

193
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:51,000
and cheap, and I'm 10 years old again
telling Mother

194
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:53,912
that I went out for ice cream with daddy
when really I'm sitting in his office

195
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,072
while he's screwing his secretary
down the hall.

196
00:09:56,115 --> 00:09:57,843
I'm too much of a snob
to screw sretaries.

197
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,502
You think this is funny?!

198
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:02,752
I think that you're one to talk. I seem
to remember something about you

199
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:04,813
doing your husband's best friend
behind his back.

200
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:06,683
That was once.
I slipped once.

201
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:09,141
So you're like... you're like
an alcoholic? You're on a program...

202
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:11,073
"God grant me the serenity"
and all that crap?

203
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:12,510
You are so mean
when you know that I am right.

204
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:16,033
You know what? I am mean when
I want you to mind your own business.

205
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:20,163
- I won't keep your secrets for...
- Yes, you will.

206
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,603
Montgomerys look the other way
when it is none of their business.

207
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:27,701
Now there's a sight for sore eyes.

208
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:30,142
I got patients lined up for weeks
waiting for you to get back.

209
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:33,670
- Well, that's me... money in the bank.
- I like money in the bank.

210
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:36,913
What?

211
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:40,401
I like your brother.
He's my golden boy.

212
00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:54,410
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

213
00:10:55,315 --> 00:10:57,621
- I had to see you again.
- This is the fourth time this week.

214
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,970
Well, I checked your schedule.
I know you have an opening.

215
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:02,213
Come on, Pete. Just a quickie.

216
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:10,280
I feel like Paul doesn't share much
of himself with me either.

217
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:13,140
- He hardly wants to have sex anymore.
- I get home from work,

218
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:15,810
I'm tired, and you don't seem
that interested.

219
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:19,342
but when I ask you what's going on,
you won't talk to me.

220
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,740
I want to know what's going on with you
up here.

221
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:24,900
See, there's your first mistake,

222
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:28,391
thinking much of anything goes on
for us guys up here.

223
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:33,163
You know what I think, Greg? I think
we guys like women to think that.

224
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:36,262
maybe we think it ourselves,
but part of that is that we don't

225
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:39,742
look at ourselves, don't ask ourselves
what we're thinking or feeling.

226
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,913
Exactly. I mean, the truth is,

227
00:11:43,397 --> 00:11:45,962
all of us have things going on inside.

228
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,012
I mean, right now,

229
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:50,983
everyone in this room,
Sheldon and me included,

230
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:52,932
have a thousand things going on.

231
00:11:53,018 --> 00:11:56,901
And the trick is to open yourself
to that and to share it.

232
00:11:58,056 --> 00:12:00,700
That's... not to say,
of course, that there aren't

233
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:02,541
pieces you want to keep
to yourself.

234
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,410
You don't want to lose yourself
in a relationship.

235
00:12:06,038 --> 00:12:09,322
But the beauty of good communication
is that when you share...

236
00:12:09,448 --> 00:12:12,400
share what you're thinking, good
or bad... you both feel better,

237
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:14,390
maybe help each other.

238
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:19,743
Ryan and I used to have that.
Back in high school when we met,

239
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:22,673
we talked about everything.

240
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:24,661
And now all you want to talk
about are the kids.

241
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:28,490
That's not true.
But I'm there with them all day.

242
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:32,621
You don't want to know about that?
That's my world.

243
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,883
I know it's hard, here, in the group,
but talking...

244
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:40,473
it really will make things better.

245
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,500
I love seeing you,

246
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:53,923
- but this has gotta stop.
- I can't stay away.

247
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:58,632
Whatever you do, whenever you put
your hands on me, I swear, it's...

248
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,262
- magic.
- It's not magic,

249
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:03,973
- and it's not...
- I've been reading up a lot

250
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:07,391
on reiki therapy, healing hands.
It's supposed to be incredible.

251
00:13:07,446 --> 00:13:09,340
- Let's try it.
- I'm not a specialist at reiki.

252
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:11,993
- I can't do that.
- You can do whatever you want to me.

253
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:13,191
As a doctor,

254
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:17,003
- I can't keep pretending this is okay.
- Come on. Just one more time.

255
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:22,802
It's been taken care of. If you could
just file it, that would be great.

256
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:28,501
You know what? We haven't been speaking
for two weeks. I...

257
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:31,922
miss you. Don't treat me
like the pervert next door.

258
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:34,211
If you lived next door,
we wouldn't be having the problem.

259
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:36,823
I want to get past this. We need to
get past this.What's it gonna take

260
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,592
- for you to forgive me?
- I don't know,

261
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:40,321
I'm working on it.

262
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:11,192
We walked past your wall of pictures...

263
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:15,080
all those kids... happy and sweet
and... normal.

264
00:14:15,447 --> 00:14:16,732
and that's what...

265
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,640
- our baby should be.
- And surgery can do that.

266
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:22,521
Surgery can give your baby
gender-distinct genitalia, yes.

267
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:23,932
And we can know?

268
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,633
We can stop saying...
"it"?

269
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:29,273
Great. So let...
let's do that.

270
00:14:29,597 --> 00:14:30,871
Can we do it soon?

271
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:33,071
I can book an O.R. for tomorrow.

272
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:34,253
Afterward, we'll

273
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:38,253
supplement with estrogen
she'll be as healthy as possible.

274
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:40,660
No... that's not what we want.

275
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:44,173
It was clear to us from the second
we saw his face... he's...

276
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,371
- He's Matthew.
- But...

277
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,080
only 30% of these babies
orient toward male.

278
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:52,521
You said you don't know.
We know.

279
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:53,983
He's our son.

280
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,290
You're gonna give us our son.

281
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:04,182
I just saw Ryan and Eleanor
in the stairwell.

282
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:06,781
- You mean Ryan and Sasha?
- No, I mean Ryan and Eleanor.

283
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,250
They were communicating,
lip-to-lip.

284
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:12,883
- Did they see you?
- No, they were too focused.

285
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:16,311
I can't believe this.
Maybe it's a cry for help.

286
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:19,752
An affair in a stairwell after
marriage counseling is a cry for help?

287
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:22,391
They haven't been able to communicate
in their own relationships, so they

288
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:24,821
do this awful thing where they could
get caught because they want

289
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,503
- to force the communication.
- Only we can't tell on them.

290
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,470
It's not like they disclosed this
in session.

291
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:32,051
- I don't think the waivers apply.
- I'm not suggesting outing them.

292
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:34,512
- I'm just saying we get them to tell.
- How is exposing an affair

293
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:36,730
- going to improve communication?
- So we let the secret

294
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:39,442
keepestering till
it poisons every aspect of the group?

295
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:41,322
It'll become the 800-pound gorilla
in the room.

296
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:43,410
As therapists, we need
to acknowledge that gorilla

297
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:46,540
- and take steps to deal with it.
- We don't know what they feel about this.

298
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:49,410
We don't know what they think about it.
They could be in love. This could be

299
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:51,823
- a onetime thing.
- Which is why we need to talk to them.

300
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:54,130
What I think... as bad as this is,

301
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:57,692
getting them to confess could be
the break through the group needs.

302
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:02,582
I was surprised that you changed
your mind about doing the surgery.

303
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:04,273
Well, I can help them.

304
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:08,112
You know, the Thompsons, they are
desperate to change their situation,

305
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:09,341
for them and

306
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,891
for the baby.
And...

307
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:14,272
you made a very good case

308
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:16,210
that surgery is the only way
to really do that.

309
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:17,522
I did, but...

310
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:18,672
a boy?

311
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:21,991
- The odds are stacked against that.
- Gender's not my choice. It's theirs.

312
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:25,330
And they want him past this.
They want him better, and I can help.

313
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,402
Speaking of better...

314
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,741
I was thinking of borrowing Archer
for a few days.

315
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,380
A weekend in Palm Springs.

316
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:35,030
You know, sleeping late,
getting massages...

317
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:36,451
What?

318
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:40,221
- Do... you think that's a good idea?
- A trip with me?

319
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:42,920
No... I mean, just, you know...
healthwise.

320
00:16:42,996 --> 00:16:45,340
He... he can go back to work, but...

321
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:47,373
going to a spa is strenuous?

322
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,900
But I mean, you know Archer. I mean,
he's... gonna want to play golf,

323
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:52,930
tennis.
He'll... push himself.

324
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:56,373
- You don't want me to go.
- No! I do... it's just...

325
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:01,391
Why rush it? Because I want to go away
with my boyfriend,

326
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:04,530
like a woman,
like a woman with a lover.

327
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:05,832
Lover?

328
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:09,612
Lover. I like that.
That's a lot better than boyfriend.

329
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:12,002
He's my lover.
What do you think?

330
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:13,462
Lover.

331
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:17,202
Yeah, it sounds stupid.
It sounds like a soap opera.

332
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:19,402
- It's not...
- What about paramour?

333
00:17:27,268 --> 00:17:29,353
Arch, come on.
We're gonna be late.

334
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:34,831
You really need to learn how to knock.

335
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:42,503
- I'm sorry.
- No. That's...

336
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:45,271
- that's just what I get.
- You okay?

337
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,600
- Don't touch me.
- 'Cause my sister walked in?

338
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:49,593
We just... we never should've...

339
00:17:51,018 --> 00:17:52,753
I never should've done it.

340
00:18:02,587 --> 00:18:04,481
Where are... Archer and Addison?

341
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:06,373
Addison's waiting for him
at the office.

342
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:08,941
It's his first day back. He's got
a lot of work to catch up on, so...

343
00:18:08,986 --> 00:18:11,722
Charlotte's probably holding
his feet to the fire.

344
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:16,822
Where's Archer?

345
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:19,630
He... he got stuck at the office.
I don't

346
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:20,990
think he's gonna make it.

347
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:22,943
Aren't we here
celebrating his first day back?

348
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,641
Well, maybe I should call him.

349
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,031
He was with a patient when I left.

350
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,273
I'm gonna get a drink.

351
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,592
- What can I give you?
- Scotch, neat.

352
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:40,402
What...

353
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:44,173
- How come you're not with them?
- I decided I like the quiet.

354
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:46,063
- Me too.
- Here you go

355
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:47,973
I thought you'd be in a great mood.

356
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:50,102
Archer's back at work,
things are back to normal.

357
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:51,270
You'd think.

358
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,222
What?

359
00:18:56,987 --> 00:18:58,662
Can I tell you something...

360
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:00,731
and you can't tell...

361
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,591
you can't tell anyone?

362
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:04,953
Anything.

363
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,511
Never mind. Forget it.

364
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:14,673
Don't do that. Don't...
don't shut yourself off from me.

365
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:19,431
- You don't need to see my crazy.
- You don't think I have crazy?

366
00:19:23,515 --> 00:19:24,991
Do you feel left out?

367
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:27,641
I feel...

368
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:30,910
broken.

369
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:36,391
Archer is cheating on Naomi...

370
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:42,690
which is wrong on so many levels, but
mostly because he's gonna hurt her.

371
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:47,720
He will, and there's nothing...
I just... I can't...

372
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:53,292
It's okay.

373
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:55,010
You're okay.

374
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:56,723
What do I do?

375
00:19:57,545 --> 00:19:59,421
People make their own choices.

376
00:20:00,428 --> 00:20:02,082
You can't do it for them.

377
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:11,303
- But it's not... I don't think it's...
- Sorry I'm late.

378
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:13,231
You're here.

379
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:36,090
- You want to talk about this?
- Will it help?

380
00:20:36,426 --> 00:20:38,022
Then what's the point?

381
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:39,991
Don't...

382
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:42,163
don't be this guy.

383
00:20:43,306 --> 00:20:46,932
Don't be this limited, short-sighted,
not-good-enough guy,

384
00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:48,811
- please.
- Look, I like Naomi.

385
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:50,501
I really do. It's just...

386
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:53,220
I'm sorry.

387
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:55,461
Don't apologize to me.
Why don't you apologize to her?

388
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,923
You know, I hated him.
I hated dad for years.

389
00:20:57,968 --> 00:21:00,432
Past tense. Hated. What, do you
love him now? Now he's your hero?

390
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:03,132
I am him, Addison. I am him!

391
00:21:03,217 --> 00:21:06,512
Like father like son. Whatever he passed
down to me, I'm missing a gene.

392
00:21:06,596 --> 00:21:09,480
You don't think I want to be better?
you don't think I want to be a good man

393
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,260
- in a storm? I don't have it in me.
- That's a cop-out.

394
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:13,480
Maybe it is,

395
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:15,421
but it's honest.

396
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:24,030
Do you usually do this,
have us come in alone?

397
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,172
Sheldon's never done this before.

398
00:21:26,508 --> 00:21:30,403
Well, sometimes I find things
that are best served outside the group.

399
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,321
What's going on?

400
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:42,890
I saw you in the stairwell yesterday.

401
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:46,292
- Oh, god.
- It just happened.

402
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:50,952
After the first session, Ryan and I,
we started talking, and...

403
00:21:52,237 --> 00:21:53,193
it was easy.

404
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:56,720
Everything you said about communication
that we couldn't do with our spouses,

405
00:21:56,937 --> 00:21:58,333
the two of us could.

406
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:02,431
Are you gonna tell?

407
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,382
You can't do that.

408
00:22:05,387 --> 00:22:06,260
Can you?

409
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:09,800
You might think that keeping
this a secret is a good thing

410
00:22:09,855 --> 00:22:12,202
and that holding it in is better, but

411
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:15,573
I think it would be best for both of you
to go home,

412
00:22:15,697 --> 00:22:17,263
talk to your spouses and

413
00:22:17,476 --> 00:22:19,150
work together to try to figure this out.

414
00:22:19,198 --> 00:22:22,191
You came to the group
to work on your marriages,

415
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:24,013
to make things better.

416
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:27,071
Is that still what you want,
to work on your marriages?

417
00:22:28,655 --> 00:22:30,151
We want to be together.

418
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:34,173
and if telling our spouses is the
first step to a new life together...

419
00:22:35,858 --> 00:22:36,900
We'll do it.

420
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:44,021
Instead of wanting to save
their marriage, they're just

421
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:47,192
- willing to walk away.
- Maybe it's a good thing.

422
00:22:47,527 --> 00:22:49,283
I mean, if it's not working,
why force it?

423
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:52,173
I don't know what's worse... to be
faithful in a loveless marriage or to

424
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:54,981
- cheat to find true love.
- What are we talking about?

425
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:56,502
Keeping secrets.

426
00:22:57,036 --> 00:22:58,112
That's tough,

427
00:22:58,236 --> 00:22:59,561
keeping people's secrets.

428
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,501
That's why it's better not to.
I mean, if...

429
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:03,652
if you care about that person,
you just tell 'em,

430
00:23:03,778 --> 00:23:05,741
- bottom line.
- Especially in a marriage.

431
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:08,542
The bond between a husband
and wife is sacrosanct.

432
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,023
Like the bond between a parent
and a child.

433
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:16,440
- How is the Thompson baby?
- I'm operating today.

434
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:19,130
The parents want a boy, and I think
it's important to respect that.

435
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,550
What about what that kid wants?

436
00:23:20,587 --> 00:23:22,391
He's a little young
to make that decision.

437
00:23:22,477 --> 00:23:24,212
I hope you make the right one.

438
00:23:25,768 --> 00:23:27,013
Are you hungry?

439
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:29,253
Frustrated.

440
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:31,503
Charlotte acts like I'm
cheating on her.

441
00:23:31,575 --> 00:23:34,772
I mean, here I am trying to be
the good guy... all I get is guilt.

442
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:38,523
I'm... I'm really not the person
you should talk to about this, Cooper.

443
00:23:38,647 --> 00:23:39,681
Talk to her.

444
00:23:50,766 --> 00:23:52,063
We need to talk.

445
00:23:57,277 --> 00:24:00,132
stop treating me
like I've done something horrible,

446
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:03,172
like taking care of my friend
is cheating on you.

447
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:06,572
- You don't know...
- You don't know.

448
00:24:06,657 --> 00:24:08,990
All I've ever wanted to do
is make you happy.

449
00:24:09,505 --> 00:24:11,881
I can't do that
if you're shutting me out.

450
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:17,582
Please.

451
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:34,012
You ready to do this?

452
00:24:36,187 --> 00:24:38,531
I'm sorry we left so early
last night. It's...

453
00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:42,621
I just... I think Archer's just so glad
to be healthy again, that we...

454
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,442
I'm sorry. No, never mind.
I know...

455
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:48,962
some details I just have to keep
to myself.

456
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:50,933
I asked him about going away, and...

457
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:52,480
we're thinking maybe next weekend.

458
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:55,552
and I came up with a name for him.
"Beau."

459
00:24:56,586 --> 00:25:00,691
He's my beau. You know, it's simple and
it's a little old-fashioned, but still,

460
00:25:00,726 --> 00:25:02,540
I think it's better than "boyfriend."

461
00:25:02,616 --> 00:25:03,832
I can't do this.

462
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:18,133
Is something wrong?
You said it was gonna be hours.

463
00:25:17,865 --> 00:25:18,861
I can't do this.

464
00:25:18,945 --> 00:25:21,113
- I'm sorry. I can't do the surgery.
- Is the baby sick?

465
00:25:21,997 --> 00:25:24,222
- The baby is fine.
- That's just it.

466
00:25:25,028 --> 00:25:28,971
The baby is fine. But you, Naomi,
we all want to change the baby

467
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:30,923
into a him,
into something that he's not.

468
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:33,021
So you... you just want
to leave him a freak?

469
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:36,400
- He... he's not a freak.
- He is if they don't do the surgery.

470
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:38,282
Please, you gotta do this.
Give us our son.

471
00:25:38,368 --> 00:25:40,062
I can't. I can't do it. I won't.

472
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:49,160
If you want a boy,
you can still have a boy.

473
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:51,751
You can take him home and...
and call him Matthew and

474
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:53,660
love him and accept him

475
00:25:53,788 --> 00:25:56,883
for what he is and raise him so that,
when the time comes,

476
00:25:56,957 --> 00:25:59,241
he'll make the choice that's...
that's right for him.

477
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:01,583
and mean while, what, our...
our kid should hide? Be

478
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:04,611
- embarrassed, humiliated, what?
- We could protect him.

479
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:07,221
What do you think it'll be like
to be a 6-year-old boy with a vagina?

480
00:26:07,247 --> 00:26:10,071
Imagine being a 20-year-old
woman without one.

481
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:14,871
We'll... we'll find another surgeon,
someone who will do this.

482
00:26:17,297 --> 00:26:18,323
She's right.

483
00:26:18,918 --> 00:26:22,322
We need to think about this.
It is too important to just

484
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:25,163
- hurt him this way.
- Him. That's right, him.

485
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:28,213
That in there, our baby,
it's a him.

486
00:26:28,657 --> 00:26:31,042
and leaving him like this,
it's not right.

487
00:26:31,435 --> 00:26:35,481
- I don't want to make a mistake.
- Well, I can't... I can't do this.

488
00:26:35,656 --> 00:26:37,672
All right? I can't do this.
I can't... take

489
00:26:37,758 --> 00:26:41,300
that home and hope it turns out right.
I can't...

490
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:45,452
I can't change that diaper
every day and...

491
00:26:49,068 --> 00:26:50,273
I can't do this.

492
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,342
I can't. I can't.

493
00:27:03,608 --> 00:27:05,411
Did yesterday's session...

494
00:27:06,018 --> 00:27:07,410
bring up anything?

495
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:11,490
Ryan came to me.

496
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,830
He... said he wanted to talk.

497
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:17,842
I was surprised.
It had been so long.

498
00:27:18,068 --> 00:27:20,720
And he had this look on his face.

499
00:27:20,997 --> 00:27:24,210
And he started to tell me
all the things that were wrong

500
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:25,942
and how he was feeling,

501
00:27:26,138 --> 00:27:27,330
and I guess...

502
00:27:28,157 --> 00:27:29,623
It's not all him.

503
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:31,503
It's me.

504
00:27:32,337 --> 00:27:33,350
It's us.

505
00:27:35,097 --> 00:27:37,653
We talked for hours, and then..

506
00:27:39,068 --> 00:27:40,283
We had sex.

507
00:27:40,986 --> 00:27:43,270
- Sasha, come on.
- We did.

508
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:45,270
We can talk about it.

509
00:27:45,396 --> 00:27:47,411
For the first time in a long time,

510
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:49,942
we had sex, and it was great.

511
00:27:50,928 --> 00:27:52,773
Something about it felt

512
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:54,253
new and

513
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:55,673
better

514
00:27:56,356 --> 00:27:57,461
and different.

515
00:27:57,656 --> 00:27:59,460
I guess because I felt like

516
00:27:59,797 --> 00:28:01,010
he was there.

517
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,673
I know that this might be...

518
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:16,171
uncomfortable,

519
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:20,530
but it might be helpful
if you could tell us how you feel.

520
00:28:25,376 --> 00:28:27,892
Well, it wasn't what I thought
I'd be saying.

521
00:28:29,477 --> 00:28:30,762
But we talked,

522
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:32,620
and I remembered what we had

523
00:28:33,237 --> 00:28:35,092
and what we can still have.

524
00:28:42,196 --> 00:28:43,570
I had an affair.

525
00:28:54,586 --> 00:28:56,202
What the hell just happened back there?

526
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:59,060
I don't understand what just happened.
You agreed to do the surgery and...

527
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:01,250
- This isn't about the surgery.
- Well, what is it?

528
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,392
I thought...

529
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:06,540
that he could be a different person.
After

530
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:10,481
everything he went through,
after almost dying, I thought...

531
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:13,392
he could be a different person.

532
00:29:14,028 --> 00:29:15,821
I wanted to believe that so much that

533
00:29:15,858 --> 00:29:17,143
I almost cut into a baby

534
00:29:17,206 --> 00:29:19,802
to convince myself
that people can change,

535
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,331
that I can change them.
but I can't.

536
00:29:24,968 --> 00:29:26,752
Archer's cheating on you.

537
00:29:30,587 --> 00:29:31,863
And I'm sorry.

538
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,902
Who was it?!
Someone I know?!

539
00:29:46,956 --> 00:29:49,290
Tthis may be hard to hear, Paul,
but sometimes

540
00:29:49,336 --> 00:29:52,022
an affair isn't moving away,
it's reaching out...

541
00:29:52,506 --> 00:29:54,371
- For the wrong thing.
- It's reaching out

542
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:57,321
towards someone who seems
like an answer.

543
00:29:58,168 --> 00:30:01,342
But they're not.
They're a crutch, a way to

544
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,860
fill the void
of something that's missing,

545
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:06,170
the person that you really love.

546
00:30:07,336 --> 00:30:08,963
The person I really love?

547
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:13,340
I thought I had lost that with Sasha.

548
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:16,373
I was in the same boat you are.

549
00:30:17,226 --> 00:30:19,213
Maybe we all are in the same boat.

550
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:20,491
But isn't it...

551
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,803
isn't it worth another chance?

552
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:29,292
.I think I made a mistake

553
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:31,373
- I don't care.
- But you should,

554
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:34,052
because if you want anything to change,
you have to work at it.

555
00:30:34,118 --> 00:30:36,790
You... haven't shared yourself,
and I...

556
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:39,670
I understand that.

557
00:30:39,757 --> 00:30:42,033
how can you share yourself
if you don't know what you think

558
00:30:42,128 --> 00:30:43,603
or you don'tnow what you feel, and

559
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:48,523
it makes you feel pathetic and crazy
and bad? And you think that if you

560
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:51,632
share that, then
they might decide that...

561
00:30:51,927 --> 00:30:54,870
you're as crazy
as you feel you are.

562
00:30:57,137 --> 00:30:59,943
But we're...all of us...
we're... we're human.

563
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:01,571
We make mistakes.

564
00:31:01,956 --> 00:31:02,870
I have,

565
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,783
I know Eleanor has,
and I bet you have, too.

566
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:08,072
But if you can talk to her

567
00:31:08,248 --> 00:31:10,543
about this,
if you can open up with her,

568
00:31:12,008 --> 00:31:16,232
Then I... really think you can work
through this and make things better.

569
00:31:21,135 --> 00:31:22,270
You know what?

570
00:31:24,705 --> 00:31:25,783
I'm done.

571
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:44,611
I'm afraid that Carol will leave me,

572
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:46,091
just like Paul did.

573
00:31:46,866 --> 00:31:48,171
When you come home at night

574
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:51,272
and you talk about how great the guys
are you work with,

575
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:53,073
I feel small...

576
00:31:54,197 --> 00:31:55,432
insignificant.

577
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:58,133
I know who I am and what I am...

578
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:03,033
but it scares me that
you'll realize you could do better.

579
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,993
You should've talked to me.

580
00:32:13,268 --> 00:32:14,741
Because I want you.

581
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:16,643
I love you.

582
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:36,812
This has got to stop.

583
00:32:36,886 --> 00:32:39,383
When I'm with you,
what you do to me...

584
00:32:40,356 --> 00:32:43,001
These days, it's the best day
I ever feel.

585
00:32:42,608 --> 00:32:43,411
Look...

586
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:47,071
I want to try this new herb...
red clover. It's supposed to put

587
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:50,052
years on your life
and take years off your face.

588
00:32:51,408 --> 00:32:53,630
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You have cancer.

589
00:32:53,717 --> 00:32:55,011
I know that.

590
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:57,040
Stage II lymphoma.

591
00:32:58,585 --> 00:32:59,681
I know that.

592
00:33:00,997 --> 00:33:02,772
God, I know that.
You don't have to say it.

593
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:03,580
I do.

594
00:33:09,046 --> 00:33:10,891
I love that you come to see me.

595
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:13,571
You're one of my favorite patients.

596
00:33:13,998 --> 00:33:16,213
But I've referred you
to the best oncologist in town,

597
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:18,283
and you won't go.
You have to go.

598
00:33:18,406 --> 00:33:20,673
I tried.
I made it to the waiting room.

599
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,990
But those people are so frail.

600
00:33:23,647 --> 00:33:26,521
I mean, they're bald or worse...
bad wigs

601
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,412
and chapped skin. I c...

602
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,313
- I can't be like that.
- They're sick like you are,

603
00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:35,790
but they're getting the right treatment,
they are trying to get better.

604
00:33:35,835 --> 00:33:36,893
What if they don't?

605
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:39,970
Then they don't, but their eyes are wide
open. They know they can't cheat fate.

606
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:42,751
They're fighting,
the way you should be fighting.

607
00:33:43,446 --> 00:33:45,221
I don't want to be the one...

608
00:33:46,406 --> 00:33:47,363
who dies.

609
00:33:48,738 --> 00:33:50,460
Then be the one who lives.

610
00:34:07,816 --> 00:34:08,750
He's gone.

611
00:34:11,055 --> 00:34:12,060
I'm sorry.

612
00:34:34,608 --> 00:34:36,050
I'm going home, to New York.

613
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:37,532
Are you saying good bye

614
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,651
to Naomie.

615
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:42,281
Don't tell her about Charlotte.
that would hurt her

616
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:45,123
Archer you're living without a word,
that would hurt her

617
00:34:45,246 --> 00:34:47,182
- Don't do this.
- Bye Addie.

618
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:51,760
I love you.

619
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:13,461
I want to see how you're doing.

620
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:15,340
Mitch is gone...

621
00:35:18,476 --> 00:35:20,581
I don't know how I'm gonna do this alone

622
00:35:21,308 --> 00:35:22,532
* *** with blue

623
00:35:24,278 --> 00:35:25,171
Matthew

624
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,712
Mitch was so excited.

625
00:35:32,178 --> 00:35:33,163
You know...

626
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:38,243
I know, You want to...
save him from...

627
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:40,050
all ****** go througt, but...

628
00:35:40,176 --> 00:35:42,161
I think you're doing the right thing.

629
00:35:44,347 --> 00:35:45,350
I hope so.

630
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:55,071
You do not get to just cut and run

631
00:35:55,108 --> 00:35:57,293
just because you're afraid
of not knowing what comes next.

632
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:59,420
There are people that love you
and that need you.

633
00:35:59,435 --> 00:36:00,862
Why are you here yelling at me?

634
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:03,983
because its not okay
to just walk away

635
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,791
and pretend like it doesn't matter.

636
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:07,262
to have something incredible

637
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:10,243
and not even see what is right
in front of your face...

638
00:36:10,438 --> 00:36:11,831
your wife loves you,

639
00:36:12,017 --> 00:36:14,301
and you have a healthy child,
who, yeah,

640
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:16,112
has some issues, but so what?

641
00:36:16,186 --> 00:36:17,690
Everybody has issues.

642
00:36:18,098 --> 00:36:19,901
You need to be there for them,

643
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:22,293
- love them.
- Well, I don't know if I can.

644
00:36:22,387 --> 00:36:23,362
Grow up.

645
00:36:24,188 --> 00:36:25,222
Be a man.

646
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:30,120
You need to...
not hurt

647
00:36:30,248 --> 00:36:31,802
the woman who loves you.

648
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:48,493
Well. nice surprise.

649
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:53,312
I slept with Archer Montgomery.

650
00:36:58,497 --> 00:36:59,342
I just...

651
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:00,982
thought you should know.

652
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:06,350
You don't get to just walk away
from me after telling me that.

653
00:37:06,946 --> 00:37:08,331
How dare you?
How dare

654
00:37:08,455 --> 00:37:09,542
you do this?

655
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,561
- It's just the way I am.
- That's crap!

656
00:37:11,658 --> 00:37:13,481
You did the one thing you could

657
00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:16,332
to push me away, to make me
make the choice and not you.

658
00:37:16,406 --> 00:37:17,252
guess what.

659
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:19,332
That's not gonna work.
I'm not going anywhere.

660
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:22,413
You want to sleep with some guy
to hurt me, to make me back off?

661
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:23,400
Too bad.

662
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:24,823
I'm here.

663
00:37:24,946 --> 00:37:27,813
I'm storming the freakin' castle
for you, and you so

664
00:37:27,906 --> 00:37:29,103
underestimated me. What,

665
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:33,192
you thought I was so weak that I'm gonna
walk away because my pride got wounded?

666
00:37:38,528 --> 00:37:39,681
You are mine.

667
00:37:41,118 --> 00:37:44,731
and I'm not walking away
because you're scared.

668
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:55,971
God.

669
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,530
I am so sorry.

670
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:03,162
I'm so sorry.

671
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:08,573
This one...

672
00:38:09,457 --> 00:38:10,901
I can overlook.

673
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,043
This one.

674
00:38:12,807 --> 00:38:16,820
But you have to think long and hard about
testing me, because next time, I'm gone.

675
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:20,752
You better dig deep,
dig deep in your soul

676
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,302
and grow the hell up

677
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,450
and be in this relationship

678
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:26,630
Right now.

679
00:38:45,786 --> 00:38:47,632
I wanted to thank you
for what you said today.

680
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:50,071
- I don't think I got through to Paul.
- you got through to Greg

681
00:38:50,168 --> 00:38:52,941
and Carol, and we saved a marriage,
maybe two.

682
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,501
Trying to figure this stuff out
is hard.

683
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,871
I mean, they come to us,
they're on the brink already.

684
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:02,773
If we turn two out of three...

685
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:05,752
I say we won.

686
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:10,571
It was a shock.

687
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,162
I mean the pregnancy.

688
00:39:13,948 --> 00:39:15,420
It was... it was...

689
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:18,971
unplanned, and I don't often do
unplanned.

690
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:21,993
So this whole

691
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:24,522
thing is unfamiliar territory for me.

692
00:39:24,605 --> 00:39:26,213
And I'm just trying to...

693
00:39:28,595 --> 00:39:29,491
roll with

694
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:32,261
- it the best way I can.
- I know, Violet.

695
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:34,673
And I don't expect you to

696
00:39:34,796 --> 00:39:35,931
confide in me.

697
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,720
But if you do need me,

698
00:39:38,488 --> 00:39:39,723
I'm here for you.

699
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:56,401
You taste good.

700
00:39:57,745 --> 00:39:58,881
Really good.

701
00:40:10,448 --> 00:40:11,530
What's wrong?

702
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:14,241
What did you just call me?

703
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:16,103
What?

704
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:18,712
You just called me Naomi.

705
00:40:19,006 --> 00:40:20,080
No, I didn't.

706
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:23,923
- No, I didn't.
- You did.

707
00:40:40,257 --> 00:40:41,390
You warned me.

708
00:40:45,258 --> 00:40:46,360
I thought...

709
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:51,430
I really thought Archer had changed...

710
00:40:52,585 --> 00:40:53,821
or that he could.

711
00:40:57,648 --> 00:40:58,743
I'm sorry.

712
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:24,040
I know he's your brother, and...

713
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:25,733
I know I shouldn't.

714
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:28,952
- It's not right to say it, but...
- Say it.

715
00:41:30,837 --> 00:41:31,833
I hate him.

716
00:41:34,698 --> 00:41:35,561
Me, too.
