1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,996
Sam's blocking me from
joining the practice

2
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:13,089
- Sam was not blocking.
- Please. Violet doesn't care right now

3
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:16,015
to give the partnership to Godzilla,
Addison would say it to my face

4
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,891
since I've payed for what you owe
you'd be a fool to block me.

5
00:00:19,016 --> 00:00:20,860
- That leaves Sam.
- Everybody's really busy.

6
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:24,068
- We haven't had time to discuss it.
- You're my man on the inside.

7
00:00:24,877 --> 00:00:26,475
Work your magic.

8
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:31,113
Want to play python in the forest?

9
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,991
I'm gonna stand up very slowly now.
Would you let go?

10
00:00:34,706 --> 00:00:38,150
- You really want me to?
- No. Come on. I'm really late.

11
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:42,207
I want this, Cooper.

12
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:44,163
I want to join the practice.

13
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:48,858
I have to go.

14
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:51,921
You feel sick now,
but you get on the stand

15
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:54,003
and just look straight
at the prosecutor...

16
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:56,282
Only at him.
That's what I did, okay?

17
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,153
You don't have
to do this if you don't want to.

18
00:00:59,288 --> 00:01:00,851
No, I do, I do. I want to.

19
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:15,962
Violet Turner.

20
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:24,932
Sorry I'm late.

21
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:40,372
Please raise your right hand.

22
00:01:40,508 --> 00:01:42,382
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth,

23
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:44,473
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

24
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:53,072
Dr. Turner...

25
00:01:54,308 --> 00:01:56,470
It's customary to say "I do."

26
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:09,262
I can't do this.

27
00:02:11,385 --> 00:02:12,661
I can't do it.

28
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:22,820
<i>Saison 03 Episode 05
Strange Bedfellows</i>

29
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:28,611
- Any word on the trial?
- No, not yet.

30
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:30,850
But Violet's on the stand all day.

31
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:33,443
Oh, I heard back from Stan Parsons.

32
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:36,033
- Ooh, and?
- He is happy where he is.

33
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:40,252
Stan really would've fit in well here.
We could use another ortho guy.

34
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,910
Yeah, well, we could use
any doctor at this point.

35
00:02:43,086 --> 00:02:45,450
Look, what if...
just keep an open mind here...

36
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:48,230
What if we just...
went with Charlotte?

37
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,502
You cannot seriously think
that she would fit in here.

38
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:54,752
She's skilled, she's connected,
she's a specialty we don't have.

39
00:02:58,315 --> 00:03:00,092
What happened?
Why are you back?

40
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:07,282
She refused to testify.

41
00:03:07,528 --> 00:03:09,693
- Did you try to talk to her about it?
- I tried.

42
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:11,812
Well, she needs support, Cooper.
It's hard.

43
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:15,280
I know it's hard and I am supporting her
but she won't talk to me about it.

44
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:18,013
She won't talk to me, either,
and she won't talk to Pete,

45
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:20,192
so looks like it's your turn.

46
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:24,223
If she won't talk to them,
she's not gonna talk to me.

47
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:28,280
What the hell are you doing here?

48
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,543
No, they told us that
you'd left the practice.

49
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:32,831
They promised us
that you'd left the practice.

50
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:35,551
- You people lied to us!
- Zoe, you have this all wrong.

51
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:38,052
I do not work here anymore.

52
00:03:38,646 --> 00:03:41,130
You screw up our implantations,
and then you force us

53
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:43,011
to carry each other's babies

54
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:45,262
I'm sorry. Just sit.
I have high blood pressure.

55
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:47,680
- That's why you're here?
- The appointment's for me.

56
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:50,640
Our obstetrician thinks there
might be something wrong with the baby.

57
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:52,880
- Which one?
- Mine. Sorry.

58
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:55,152
The... the baby
that I'm carrying, her son.

59
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:57,053
It gets a little
confusing sometimes.

60
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,540
Dr. Carey said that
we needed a consult... surgical...

61
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:01,551
and the only one
he'd recommend was you.

62
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:04,532
While you're here, we'll go ahead
and get your blood pressure checked.

63
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:06,342
Zoe, why don't you come on back?

64
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:12,471
I'm sorry that I blew up.

65
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:16,682
I-I thought I was okay with
everything, but it... it's been hard.

66
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:20,813
My pregnancy, Amelia's pregnancy,
and then seeing Naomi again, I just...

67
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,892
- Something is wrong, isn't it?
- Give me a second.

68
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,803
- Dr. Carey deflected all my questions.
- I won't do that.

69
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:34,142
Oh, my god. What is it?

70
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:36,190
It's a teratoma.
It's a kind of tumor.

71
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:39,152
Sometimes when the stem
cells differentiate into cartilage,

72
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:41,573
bone or flesh, they end up
where they don't belong.

73
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:44,503
And in this case,
the tumor is large enough,

74
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:46,872
that it's taking over
the baby's blood supply.

75
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:50,991
What I'd like to do is operate, try
to separate the tumor from the fetus.

76
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,301
- And will that fix it?
- It's not that simple.

77
00:04:53,437 --> 00:04:55,760
Sometimes it works.
Sometimes it doesn't work.

78
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:58,060
But without surgery,
the baby will die.

79
00:04:58,186 --> 00:05:00,103
This is Amelia's last embryo, so...

80
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:02,843
I have to tell you
that if I do the surgery,

81
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:05,302
I'll need to perforate the uterus.
Sometimes...

82
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:08,261
that can affect your ability
to carry another child.

83
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:11,733
I know it's an awful choice. You'll
want to talk it over with your husband,

84
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:14,353
- with Amelia.
- Uh, no. Martin left.

85
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:18,153
He never liked it...
the having each other's baby thing.

86
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:21,230
And he... he didn't understand
the bond between Amelia and I.

87
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:22,880
It's... it's like...

88
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,763
Both babies belong to both of us.

89
00:05:28,156 --> 00:05:29,443
I can't do it.

90
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,511
Martin will come back,
and we've always wanted a big family.

91
00:05:33,638 --> 00:05:34,780
I just can't.

92
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:38,232
Then I'd recommend
terminating the pregnancy.

93
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:42,193
My god.
What will that do to Amelia?

94
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:47,333
And if we do nothing,
it's gonna die in the womb?

95
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:53,400
Then I think I should let it
and get Amelia further along.

96
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:56,533
I can't have her think
that I just gave up.

97
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,823
I think that it's better for her
to think that it's an act of god,

98
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,900
- whenever it happens.
- This is Amelia's baby.

99
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:03,960
- She has the right to know.
- It's in my body,

100
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:06,662
and I'm your patient. You can't
tell her without my permission.

101
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,233
You can't tell her.

102
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,623
You look like somebody shredded you.

103
00:06:13,758 --> 00:06:16,643
- Did you talk to Violet again?
- No, no. I just...

104
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:20,950
Remind me never,
ever to go upstairs again.

105
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:23,852
No, I didn't talk to Violet.
I didn't know what to say to her.

106
00:06:23,975 --> 00:06:27,050
- You gonna have another run at her?
- Nope. I'm done.

107
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:30,860
I tried. I pushed.
I... had no effect on her.

108
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:33,101
So if she wants to let Katie walk...

109
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:35,572
Katie is not gonna
walk away from this.

110
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:38,622
No, but the defense
will line up experts

111
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:40,900
- who will say she was crazy.
- Wasn't she?

112
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,202
Not guilty by reason of insanity
is not guilty, and Katie is guilty.

113
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,612
Six months in a nut farm, some meds,
a little therapy,

114
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:48,483
after what she did?
That's unacceptable.

115
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:50,361
You don't know
how long it's gonna be.

116
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:52,842
- She could be in there for years.
- I got on the stand

117
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:55,843
and told them about
the wound, the blood,

118
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:58,092
the baby gone,
thinking Violet was dead.

119
00:06:58,228 --> 00:07:01,401
But unless Violet tells
the jury what it was like,

120
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:03,073
unless they hear it from her...

121
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:05,513
But if Violet is gonna
be too traumatized...

122
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:08,322
Then she'll just keep being stuck.

123
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,893
She'll never be Violet.

124
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:12,912
And I'll still have a son

125
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:15,332
whose mother can't bring
herself to care about him.

126
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:18,871
She's missing everything...

127
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:23,153
The little sound
he makes when he smiles...

128
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:26,730
The way his eyes try to take
in the whole world at once.

129
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:30,401
- It's just gonna take time.
- She can have as much as she wants.

130
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:31,530
I'm done.

131
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,191
- Cooper put you up to this?
- We're all concerned for you.

132
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,233
Why does it matter
if I testify or not?

133
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:43,341
Why should I have to sit
there and relive it?

134
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:46,042
Why am I the only person who
can make sure Katie gets punished?

135
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:48,973
- It's not about Katie It's about you.
- That's right. It's about me.

136
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:52,221
So sitting there for 8, 10 hours a day
on the stand with Katie staring at me?

137
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:54,562
That would be like living
through it all over again.

138
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:56,043
Aren't you doing that anyway?

139
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:59,061
And don't shrinks always
say it's good to talk?

140
00:08:01,657 --> 00:08:05,480
- Well, what do shrinks know?
- I know facing her will be hard.

141
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:08,402
Being on the same planet
with her is hard.

142
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:11,422
We could all chip in and get
her one of those guest trips

143
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:13,280
to the space station, one-way.

144
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:16,197
We could probably get
a discount if it's one-way, right?

145
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:19,313
Dr. Turner, there's someone
here to see you.

146
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:20,818
- Who is it?
- A Mr. Kent.

147
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,600
He says to tell he's Katie's father.

148
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,462
Could you give us a second, please?

149
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:28,213
All right, Violet.

150
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,480
If you had a patient
in this situation,

151
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:35,132
would you tell your patient
to face it or to run away?

152
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:38,562
All right, you see that chair?

153
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:40,272
I'm gonna be sitting in it.

154
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:41,972
If you need help, you look at me,

155
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:45,300
you blink, and I'll come
riding to the rescue.

156
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:49,141
You can still blink, can't you?

157
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:50,671
Can you...

158
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:01,750
When Dr. Wilder testified...

159
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:04,023
What he found... to hear...

160
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:09,752
It's horrifying.
I can't apologize to you enough.

161
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:21,132
You helped her.

162
00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:24,832
Well... if that were true,
we wouldn't be sitting here.

163
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:29,021
No, she couldn't
stop talking about you,

164
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:31,303
how you just knew.

165
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:35,790
You knew that all she wanted
was to have her baby and...

166
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:39,711
be not sick anymore.

167
00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:44,441
She told me I was going to
be so proud of her. She said,

168
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:47,042
"you'll see, dad.
I'm gonna be just like mom."

169
00:09:52,656 --> 00:09:55,162
If that jury sends her to prison,

170
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:56,800
she'll disappear.

171
00:09:57,578 --> 00:10:00,122
This illness will eat her alive.

172
00:10:00,957 --> 00:10:02,572
Why are you here?

173
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:06,500
Katie wants to see you.
She wants to talk to you.

174
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:09,760
She says you're the only
person who understands.

175
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,102
- Violet talked to you?
- Yeah, I guess she was just ready.

176
00:10:22,236 --> 00:10:23,603
But to you?

177
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:26,051
Do you want to hear
what she had to say or not?

178
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:29,921
She doesn't want to testify because
she's terrified of facing Katie.

179
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:32,483
- That's the revelation?
- We were interrupted.

180
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:34,853
Katie's father showed up.

181
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:36,632
Why? What did he want?

182
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:39,871
I don't know. But when he left,
she went and hid in the ladies room.

183
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:42,890
- You got a minute?
- Yeah. Just... in one minute.

184
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:44,661
I was talking to Sam.

185
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:47,933
- We're just in the middle of a...
- It'll only take a second.

186
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:54,612
I am a damn fine doctor with
an established patient base,

187
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,110
and as I made clear, I have
great ideas for expanding it.

188
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:59,740
I have the cash to buy in.
I'm chief of staff at St. Ambrose,

189
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:02,510
so I can steer you so many
heart surgeries, you'll beg for mercy.

190
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:04,223
Why are you stalling?

191
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:07,662
Because I just don't think
you're... the right fit here.

192
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:11,903
You know, we're... all friends,
we respect each other, we get along.

193
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:15,722
I guess that would be why Naomi and Pete
couldn't get outta here fast enough.

194
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:20,251
We need someone who is great with
patients, someone who's great with staff

195
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,262
- someone's who calm...
- You want Naomi.

196
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,173
I don't want to be mean,

197
00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:26,681
but I just don't like you.

198
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:35,872
Good grief. What does that
have to do with anything?

199
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:38,553
Excuse me.

200
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:42,053
I need to talk to you
about Amelia and Zoe.

201
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,040
This place is a kindergarten.

202
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:48,092
If somebody's offering you something
you need, don't you just grab at it

203
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:50,303
instead of whining about
your delicate feelings?

204
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:52,990
What on god's green earth do
feelings have to do with anything?

205
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:54,870
It's good for you or it isn't.

206
00:11:57,858 --> 00:11:59,171
You agree with me?

207
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:02,500
- Sure.
- Something needs doing, you just do it.

208
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:04,351
Otherwise, what good are you?

209
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:09,512
- It's Amelia's baby.
- Ethically, it doesn't matter.

210
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,841
It's in Zoe's body.
Zoe's my patient.

211
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:14,113
I can't breach confidentiality.

212
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:16,880
I hate this.
I hate that this baby is sick.

213
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:20,012
I hate that Zoe won't
let me even try to fix it...

214
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:23,862
That I'm lying to Amelia,
that Naomi's caught up in this again.

215
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,382
We're all caught up in it.

216
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,950
If this baby dies, then the settlement
goes out the window.

217
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:31,403
It's based on these two women bringing
these babies to term and then switching.

218
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:34,381
If that can't happen, then we're
facing a malpractice suit. So, no.

219
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:36,723
Lying to Amelia
will only make it worse.

220
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,430
I know that.
I tried to get Zoe to change her mind.

221
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:43,430
- Look, Naomi knows them...
- Don't even think it.

222
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,480
You saw how hostile Zoe is.

223
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:47,953
- Do not bring Naomi in.
- I just meant to ask her...

224
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:50,861
If litigation starts again, they
smell that Naomi's been involved...

225
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:53,850
- They'll go after her first.
- They'll go after her first.

226
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:59,043
So nobody knows what Katie's
father said to Violet except Violet,

227
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,581
and she's not talking, except
to Sam, and not about that.

228
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,780
I didn't get a babysitter
to talk about Violet.

229
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:06,231
- What do you want to talk about?
- Anything but that.

230
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:08,992
We could talk about Charlotte,
my benefactor.

231
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:12,711
- You upset because she paid your way?
- I love being emasculated.

232
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,941
Okay, no Violet talk
and no Charlotte talk.

233
00:13:15,356 --> 00:13:16,771
You want to bet on the game?

234
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:18,783
If you lose,
do I collect from Charlotte?

235
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:22,472
If you could've seen her face.

236
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:24,842
Who knew Charlotte had feelings?

237
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:26,543
Thanks. That helps a lot.

238
00:13:26,676 --> 00:13:28,872
You can't tell
your friend's girlfriend

239
00:13:28,997 --> 00:13:31,440
- that you don't like her.
- I know, I tried to dodge her,

240
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:34,400
but she backed me into a corner
and kept on telling me all the reasons

241
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:36,940
- why we should hire her and...
- We should hire her.

242
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:39,852
- You don't actually like her?
- I like her check.

243
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,302
I like that hiring her
would make Cooper happy.

244
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:45,581
I like that we would be moving
forward in at least one area.

245
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:48,050
And I like her specialty.
It could be good for business.

246
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:51,641
Look, we have a problem.
She is our solution.

247
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:55,620
All right, fine.
Let's just get it over with.

248
00:13:57,777 --> 00:13:58,922
Hey, up here.

249
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:01,672
Oh, I'm interrupting.

250
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:03,940
I was just leaving, really.

251
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:06,913
Amelia came to see
me this afternoon.

252
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,353
I was surprised, too, given
what happened this morning,

253
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:11,711
but she thinks there's
something wrong with the baby,

254
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:15,010
and she thinks that you and
Zoe are lying to her about it.

255
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:19,223
I know I'm supposed
to be out of this, but...

256
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:22,193
she looks like she's about
ready to explode. So...

257
00:14:22,825 --> 00:14:24,120
is she right?

258
00:14:24,516 --> 00:14:27,072
- Are you lying to her?
- There is a problem.

259
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:31,113
- That we can't tell you about.
- Okay. How serious is it?

260
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:33,490
- Can it be corrected?
- This is ridiculous.

261
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,040
We're playing 20 questions.
They were Naomi's patients.

262
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:40,003
Like it or not, we are all in this.
We either all sink or we all swim.

263
00:14:40,407 --> 00:14:44,320
It's a sacrococcygeal teratoma, and
it's on the baby that Zoe's carrying.

264
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,760
- Can't that be operated on?
- I'd like to try, but Zoe said no.

265
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:50,221
Well, that can't be the end of it.

266
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:53,871
- I know you don't want me involved...
- Not a good beginning of a sentence.

267
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:56,600
Amelia came to me,
and I have to do something.

268
00:14:57,508 --> 00:15:00,250
Zoe's mad, but she was
my patient, and I do know her.

269
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:04,101
So get me into a room with her and
maybe I can get her to change her mind.

270
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,641
You guys have to let me try.

271
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:40,420
Thank you for coming.

272
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:44,543
I'm on my meds.

273
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:46,450
I'm myself.

274
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:48,740
I've heard that.

275
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:55,581
So you wanted to see me?

276
00:15:58,326 --> 00:15:59,603
How are you?

277
00:16:06,305 --> 00:16:07,823
Dr. Turner, I am...

278
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:09,553
I'm so sorry.

279
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:14,093
Please... tell me you know it
wasn't me who did that to you.

280
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:16,670
- Please tell me you know that.
- Why?

281
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:20,161
So that I'll know you understand
that I'm not

282
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:21,482
a monster.

283
00:16:21,617 --> 00:16:23,891
- That's why you wanted to see me?
- That...

284
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:26,852
and I want you to testify.

285
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:30,792
When Dr. Wilder was on the stand, the
jury looked at me like I am a monster.

286
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:33,120
And you think my testimony
would counteract that?

287
00:16:33,256 --> 00:16:35,240
I think if you testify,
the jurors will know

288
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,343
They will know
that I was crazy that night.

289
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:39,870
- And you'll avoid prison.
- I won't get help in prison.

290
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:43,902
I'll slip. I'll be crazy again.
I don't ever want to be crazy again.

291
00:16:44,027 --> 00:16:46,193
I'm scared.
I'm scared of that...

292
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:48,920
That person who did that.

293
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:53,091
It's...
It's not about avoiding punishment.

294
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:56,043
It's just... I need help.

295
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:58,813
I need someone on my side.

296
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:05,892
You gutted me like a pig.

297
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:09,732
You ripped my baby out of my body.

298
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:13,820
You left me there to bleed to death,
and now I should be on your side?

299
00:17:14,636 --> 00:17:17,702
I should care about
how sorry you are?

300
00:17:18,155 --> 00:17:20,922
I should give a damn
about what happens to you?

301
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:24,211
You made my life hell.
You made me crazy.

302
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:27,500
And now you want
a free pass from me?

303
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,463
Please, Dr. Turner.

304
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,093
Please!

305
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:38,192
Dr. Turner, please!

306
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:48,371
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

307
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:51,740
I know how angry you are,
and how much you blame me

308
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:54,272
- and rightfully so...
- I don't want your apologies.

309
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,672
Dr. Montgomery said that you had
something that you needed to say to me,

310
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:01,251
- so, why don't you just say it?
- Amelia came to see me.

311
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:04,673
- You told Amelia?
- No, I told you I wouldn't.

312
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,621
Amelia came to me. She knows
you're hiding something.

313
00:18:07,747 --> 00:18:10,022
She knows that there is something
wrong with the baby.

314
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,310
So now you want to atone by talking me
into something that I don't want to do?

315
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:17,512
When all this happened, I did not
want to talk you into keeping the baby.

316
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:20,742
All I wanted was for you
to see things from all sides.

317
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:23,953
It was not about me.
This was so you could feel as okay

318
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:28,271
with what was going to happen as you
possibly could given what we did to you,

319
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:31,561
given what I did to you,
what I did to you.

320
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:33,793
I wasn't the one
who changed your mind.

321
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:35,980
It was Amelia and it was you,

322
00:18:36,496 --> 00:18:40,473
knowing that it was the best
thing given the circumstances.

323
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:44,690
If the situation were the other way
around, wouldn't you want to know?

324
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:47,523
Don't you see?
It is the other way around.

325
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:50,831
This is my baby, too.
They're both mine.

326
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:53,251
They're both hers.
If I tell her now...

327
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:56,590
Tell her that I am going to end this
pregnancy... it will be bad for her...

328
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:00,271
Her blood pressure.
She's already at risk for eclampsia.

329
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,380
I may lose both babies.
We'll lose both.

330
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:06,653
Or I could do the surgery,
at least try.

331
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:16,722
If you're gonna choose
not to have the surgery,

332
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:19,190
then you're gonna have to let
Addison end the pregnancy.

333
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:22,010
If you ever want to be pregnant again,
it is the safest choice.

334
00:19:22,135 --> 00:19:25,472
- And that means... telling Amelia.
- Okay, I'll tell her.

335
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:28,103
But you have to explain to her
why the surgery can't be done.

336
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:29,950
You cannot put that on me.

337
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:40,763
About Charlotte... she was in a bitch
of a mood when I got home last night.

338
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:43,043
- Cooper, I'm sorry.
- I don't want your apology.

339
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:46,883
Make a decision one way or another.
Is she in or is she out? Come on.

340
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:51,490
We did. We called her this
morning. She didn't tell you?

341
00:19:51,797 --> 00:19:54,042
No. I left early for rounds.
What is it, yes or no?

342
00:19:54,178 --> 00:19:56,731
She's moving in to
Pete's old office right now.

343
00:20:03,277 --> 00:20:04,832
You coulda called me.

344
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,173
- Congratulations.
- I wanted to surprise ya.

345
00:20:08,297 --> 00:20:10,910
Just anywhere except for that one.
It goes on the desk.

346
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,670
This is... this is gonna be great.

347
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:20,532
Wait till you see what
I got going on in here.

348
00:20:21,976 --> 00:20:24,222
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes.

349
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:30,570
What is this for?
I mean, why is it here?

350
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:33,462
- New job, new specialty.
- Porn shop?

351
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:36,270
- Sexual dysfunction.
- You're a urologist.

352
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:40,052
That and now more.
Look. I hired a web designer.

353
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:42,560
You'll be able to click on
a condition, get information.

354
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:45,031
You can do an e-mail consultation,
you can order stuff,

355
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:47,162
you can make
an appointment to come in.

356
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:48,903
This didn't happen since last night?

357
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:50,950
You been thinking
about this one for a while?

358
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,832
You didn't think to mention this to me?
It just slipped your mind?

359
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:56,790
- It's a work in progress.
- What do you call it? What, is it like,

360
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:58,292
genitology?

361
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:00,211
- Can't-Function-Ology?
- Sexology.

362
00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:02,552
Is that what it's gonna say
on your business card...

363
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:04,441
Dr. Charlotte King, sexologist?

364
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:06,372
Kinda sounds a little bit like

365
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:10,082
- a hooker or a dominatrix.
- You did not just call me a hooker.

366
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:12,832
No, I said it sounds
a little bit like a hooker.

367
00:21:13,008 --> 00:21:15,701
- This is a legitimate medical specialty
- Really?

368
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,571
This?

369
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,590
How old are you?
Some people have trouble with sex.

370
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:24,361
They need a doctor's help.
I emphasize "doctor."

371
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:26,602
You know what? Let's table this.

372
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:30,700
Violet Turner.

373
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:33,451
All right, pick a fist.

374
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:35,203
Come on. Pick a fist.

375
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:40,042
Good. Yes. See? That means
you have to answer one question.

376
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,803
You still don't want to talk to me?

377
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,851
It's not that.
I'm just afraid you're gonna

378
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:46,100
pressure me into doing something
I don't want to do.

379
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:47,622
But Sam. You talked to Sam.

380
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:49,632
- No pressure.
- I will not pressure you.

381
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:50,763
Promise.

382
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:53,430
Okay.

383
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,432
What's the question?

384
00:21:55,608 --> 00:21:59,101
Why... did Katie's father
come in to see you?

385
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:01,730
To tell me that
katie wants to see me.

386
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:04,691
And did he really think you
were gonna go?

387
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:05,823
I did go.

388
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:07,973
I thought that...

389
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:10,700
If I could face her... just us...

390
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:12,892
then I could face her in the court.

391
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:15,333
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've gone with you.

392
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:16,913
How'd it go?

393
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:20,481
I wanted to rip her lungs out,
but the deputy was there.

394
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,633
That's probably a good thing...
for Katie.

395
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:24,143
She wants to me testify.

396
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:26,131
She wants me to say
that she's crazy.

397
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:28,223
And... what do you want?

398
00:22:31,468 --> 00:22:33,961
Well, Dr. Turner thinks
she needs help.

399
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:35,972
But Violet wants her dead.

400
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:38,413
You can have conflicting
emotions about a person.

401
00:22:38,535 --> 00:22:40,813
I speak from experience.

402
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:43,453
But only one of us can testify.

403
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:48,073
What should I do?

404
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:54,553
I think Dr. Turner's
the best psychiatrist I know.

405
00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:57,743
But I want what's best for Violet.

406
00:23:00,356 --> 00:23:03,802
The teratoma depletes
the baby's blood supply,

407
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:05,920
and the foetus can't develop
or thrive.

408
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:07,532
And the baby dies?

409
00:23:07,658 --> 00:23:10,390
Amelia, I wanted to tell you.
I was...

410
00:23:10,518 --> 00:23:13,620
Is there anything that we can do
except for the surgery?

411
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,272
I wish there were.

412
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:19,193
- If I thought that there was a way...
- I understand. I do. I do.

413
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,170
Are you okay?

414
00:23:24,646 --> 00:23:27,191
I'm okay. I'm just... I'm a little
light-headed, I think.

415
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:29,692
I'm gonna go ahead and take
your blood pressure now.

416
00:23:31,138 --> 00:23:34,521
When we first found out
we had the wrong babies,

417
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:35,870
I was afraid.

418
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:39,042
I was afraid that you wouldn't
try to make it work.

419
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:42,673
Thank you for trying.

420
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:46,032
So what do we do now?

421
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:48,222
I think termination is best.

422
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:52,081
I want to be there.

423
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:54,200
I'm sorry.

424
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:57,150
I know... I know
this must be hard for you

425
00:23:57,395 --> 00:24:00,651
if you... if you feel... if you feel
anything like the...

426
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:02,730
like the way that I...
that I feel...

427
00:24:02,906 --> 00:24:05,942
Her pulse is weak and thready.
Get 4 liters of oxygen going.

428
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:08,270
- I'm gonna get an I.V. pack.
- You just breathe.

429
00:24:08,908 --> 00:24:11,900
- All right, lean back. Slow breaths.
- I'm okay.

430
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:16,930
Is the baby okay?

431
00:24:18,885 --> 00:24:21,301
You just had a transient rise
in blood pressure.

432
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:23,481
It slowed your heart down,
but you're okay now.

433
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:24,601
Thank God.

434
00:24:25,116 --> 00:24:26,731
I am such a mess.

435
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:29,122
You just need to avoid stress

436
00:24:29,246 --> 00:24:31,110
and rest so it doesn't
get any worse.

437
00:24:31,235 --> 00:24:34,243
And I am going to call
your regular ob-gyn

438
00:24:34,368 --> 00:24:36,731
and see about adjusting
your medication.

439
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:40,081
- I wanted to be stronger for her.
- You are.

440
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:43,143
- Is she still here?
- Of course she is.

441
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,571
I'll go get her.

442
00:24:55,998 --> 00:24:58,920
- How is Amelia and the baby?
- Amelia's gotta be careful,

443
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:01,230
but they're both going to be fine.

444
00:25:01,357 --> 00:25:03,043
Good. That's good.

445
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:06,722
I changed my mind.
I want to have the surgery.

446
00:25:06,858 --> 00:25:09,253
I want you to try,
as soon as you can.

447
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:11,383
I know.
I know what I said.

448
00:25:11,555 --> 00:25:14,183
But she is putting her health
at risk for my baby.

449
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:17,202
She's doing it for me.
I need to do it for her.

450
00:25:22,826 --> 00:25:25,131
Did Violet decide whether
or not she's gonna testify?

451
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:27,640
I think she will. I just don't
know what she's gonna say.

452
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:29,271
I think that she should...

453
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,153
ix-nay on the iolet-vay...

454
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:32,593
I've backed off.

455
00:25:32,726 --> 00:25:35,143
Will she? Won't she?
It's not my concern.

456
00:25:35,277 --> 00:25:37,031
If you want to try
to change her mind

457
00:25:37,157 --> 00:25:39,071
Not me. Katie.
Katie wants her to testify,

458
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,700
- tell the jury that she was crazy.
- Is Violet actually considering...

459
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:45,520
Can we talk about something else?

460
00:25:46,355 --> 00:25:48,861
Charlotte is going into sexology.

461
00:25:49,646 --> 00:25:52,102
- How crazy is that?
- I don't think it's crazy at all.

462
00:25:52,236 --> 00:25:54,601
- She didn't tell you?
- What, you knew?

463
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:56,841
Of course we knew.
She didn't tell you?

464
00:25:57,018 --> 00:25:59,162
Dude, you gotta work on
your communication skills.

465
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:01,721
Besides, I think she'll be
good at sexology.

466
00:26:03,335 --> 00:26:05,433
- I'm assuming...
- That is exactly the problem.

467
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,350
- It's a medical specialty.
- That is so not the point.

468
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,353
You said you wanted her
in the practice.

469
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,193
As a doctor, Sam. As...

470
00:26:12,585 --> 00:26:15,233
Excuse me. May I have
another one of these, please?

471
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,283
Hey, listen. It's Brad.

472
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:22,230
If your girlfriend told you
that she was gonna be a sexologist,

473
00:26:23,045 --> 00:26:24,940
would you be okay with that?

474
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:36,020
Where have you been?

475
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:38,861
I had a party.

476
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:41,140
A gin party?

477
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:44,593
With Brad the bartender.

478
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,803
Did you kill anybody
on your way home?

479
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:50,343
I'm a responsible adult.

480
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:52,042
I took a cab.

481
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:55,793
You know, I decided it's a good
thing that you're a sexologist.

482
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:56,911
Really?

483
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,063
It's gonna be like
a peep show for me at work.

484
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:01,150
You can put on
your little leather teddy,

485
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:03,383
and I can watch
through the window while you do

486
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:06,410
what you do the way that you do it,
because you're really good at it,

487
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:09,710
and you really should be putting
your skills to good use.

488
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,092
Just please wear a condom.

489
00:27:13,318 --> 00:27:15,043
You get nasty mean
when you're drunk.

490
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,821
I'm not drunk. I'm clear.
And I'm happy for you.

491
00:27:17,946 --> 00:27:20,812
I'm just... I'm confused...
How do I introduce you now?

492
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:23,153
Because there's no page
on this in Emily post.

493
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:25,843
I mean, how about this?
" This is my girlfriend Charlotte."

494
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,472
"Do you need help
with your erection? "

495
00:27:31,346 --> 00:27:33,273
You know this is my bed, right?

496
00:27:33,447 --> 00:27:34,743
That I paid for!

497
00:27:38,536 --> 00:27:40,180
Take it all, Charlotte.

498
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:44,010
Leave me nothing but shame
and mortification.

499
00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:55,041
- The mass is almost as big as he is.
- You've done it before.

500
00:27:55,218 --> 00:27:57,711
But usually when I go in,
I'm trying to save one baby.

501
00:27:57,846 --> 00:27:59,980
In this case, I feel like
I'm trying to save two,

502
00:28:00,115 --> 00:28:01,980
and one's not even in the room.

503
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,570
- If I lose the baby...
- then you will have done everything

504
00:28:05,707 --> 00:28:07,880
you possibly could,
which is what we wanted.

505
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:09,913
We wanted to try everything.

506
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:15,663
If this doesn't work,
it won't be good for you.

507
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:17,601
Don't put that on yourself.
Just go.

508
00:28:19,688 --> 00:28:22,111
It's not your mistake
that got us here.

509
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:29,832
You know what she's gonna do?

510
00:28:31,615 --> 00:28:33,163
I'm glad you're here.

511
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:34,522
All rise.

512
00:28:42,956 --> 00:28:44,661
Should it be taking this long?

513
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:47,651
Addison will come and get us
just as soon as there is news.

514
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:49,281
God, I hate waiting.

515
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,620
I felt this way every time
we finished another implantation

516
00:28:52,756 --> 00:28:54,893
and I came in for a pregnancy test.
Just panic.

517
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:56,923
Sheer panic.

518
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:02,173
Amelia, I am so sorry for what
I've put you both through.

519
00:29:02,298 --> 00:29:04,453
I didn't mean to bring up
something that's

520
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,453
Please, don't try and make me
feel better for what I've done.

521
00:29:07,886 --> 00:29:10,182
It was hard at first, for all of us.

522
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:11,992
But Zoe and I...

523
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,471
It's crazy after the way
it happened, but

524
00:29:15,456 --> 00:29:18,802
I'm closer to her than I've ever
been to anybody before.

525
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:21,310
You did that, too.

526
00:29:26,405 --> 00:29:29,262
Zoe's fine,
but I couldn't save the baby.

527
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:32,682
I'm so sorry.
I did everything I could.

528
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:46,812
I do.

529
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,152
Are you comfortable, doctor?

530
00:29:50,277 --> 00:29:51,693
Are you kidding?

531
00:29:52,797 --> 00:29:54,252
I appreciate you coming back.

532
00:29:54,386 --> 00:29:56,983
I know this is hard on you,
so I'm gonna get right to it.

533
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,063
Can you tell us what happened
on the night in question?

534
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:03,923
The defendant rang my door,
and when I answered it,

535
00:30:04,097 --> 00:30:07,213
- she jabbed me with a syringe.
- Do you know what was in it?

536
00:30:07,758 --> 00:30:09,762
I remained conscious,
but I couldn't move.

537
00:30:10,028 --> 00:30:12,290
And then she told me what she
was going to do to me.

538
00:30:12,425 --> 00:30:14,420
And what did she say that was?

539
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:18,150
That she was going to cut
my baby out of my body.

540
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:23,553
And she did.

541
00:30:34,127 --> 00:30:37,283
Will you tell her it's gonna be okay?
She doesn't believe me.

542
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:39,662
You're gonna get through this, Zoe.

543
00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:41,710
I just feel like I failed you.

544
00:30:41,838 --> 00:30:45,501
- I feel like I lost my baby.
- It is not your fault.

545
00:30:45,926 --> 00:30:48,603
Listen, all of this,
it just happened.

546
00:30:49,477 --> 00:30:50,900
Okay? Come here.

547
00:30:51,547 --> 00:30:53,252
Michael is still here.

548
00:30:53,386 --> 00:30:54,781
Your baby is fine.

549
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,832
He's in here kicking.

550
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,690
And we're a family,
so it's gonna be okay.

551
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,402
We can do this together.
You'll see.

552
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:07,273
My God, are you okay?
The baby?

553
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:10,070
You come back now?

554
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:12,553
This isn't right. Now that the
baby's gone?

555
00:31:12,675 --> 00:31:14,271
No, Amelia, it's okay.

556
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:16,542
- He left you.
- No, I called him.

557
00:31:16,828 --> 00:31:18,371
I wanted him to come.

558
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:23,792
I'm so sorry you had to go through
this all alone.

559
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:25,172
I wasn't alone.

560
00:31:26,155 --> 00:31:28,131
I don't know what else to say.

561
00:31:28,308 --> 00:31:29,303
I'm sorry.

562
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:32,562
I'm back.

563
00:31:34,305 --> 00:31:36,853
I'm sorry that I didn't
call you sooner.

564
00:31:39,427 --> 00:31:40,472
Oh, my God.

565
00:31:41,976 --> 00:31:43,823
- Oh, my God.
- I am so sorry.

566
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,481
I'm just the surrogate.

567
00:31:45,658 --> 00:31:47,982
- You're much more than that.
- I thought I was.

568
00:31:48,428 --> 00:31:50,623
Her husband's back.
That's... that's good, right?

569
00:31:50,747 --> 00:31:52,643
- But I gotta go.
- No, Amelia.

570
00:31:53,755 --> 00:31:55,373
They can have other children.

571
00:31:55,536 --> 00:31:57,950
They can have other kids.
Lots of kids.

572
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:02,921
He is not your baby.
You cannot just leave and keep him.

573
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:05,503
Yes, I can.

574
00:32:07,998 --> 00:32:09,241
He's not yours.

575
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:12,460
He's all I have left.

576
00:32:20,846 --> 00:32:23,900
The last thing I remember
was her walking out of the door

577
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:25,231
with the baby.

578
00:32:25,355 --> 00:32:26,503
Nothing more?

579
00:32:27,657 --> 00:32:28,701
Just blood.

580
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:32,122
I remember the blood...

581
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,162
Spreading out...

582
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,071
All around me.

583
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,970
Thank you, Dr. Turner.

584
00:32:43,057 --> 00:32:45,712
You and Dr. Wilder were treating
the defendant, is that right?

585
00:32:46,846 --> 00:32:49,840
And you felt it was safe for her
to stop taking her medications?

586
00:32:50,017 --> 00:32:51,511
She refused to take them.

587
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:54,392
She was afraid that they would harm
the baby that she was carrying.

588
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:57,280
Did you understand that she had
an illness that required medication?

589
00:32:57,405 --> 00:32:59,621
I understood that she could
benefit from medication.

590
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:02,341
- Did she understand that she would...
- objection. Speculation.

591
00:33:02,478 --> 00:33:05,232
Your honor the witness is not just
a victim. She was the defendant's

592
00:33:05,357 --> 00:33:07,900
psychiatrist. She's an expert
in mental aberrations.

593
00:33:09,707 --> 00:33:10,913
I'll allow it.

594
00:33:11,036 --> 00:33:13,263
Were you aware that without
proper medication,

595
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:16,181
your patient would likely
lapse into a delusional state?

596
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:20,181
- Likely is not quite the right word.
- All right.

597
00:33:20,307 --> 00:33:22,713
Do you think it was possible
for her to become delusional?

598
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:24,962
Your honor, counsel is trying
to blame the victim

599
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,251
- for not being clairvoyant.
- I'll rephrase.

600
00:33:27,425 --> 00:33:29,081
Dr. Turner, in your expert opinion,

601
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:32,673
on the night in question,
was the defendant delusional?

602
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:50,342
Yes, she was.

603
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:14,530
Dr. Turner.

604
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,463
I hate what you did to me.

605
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:24,391
So do I.

606
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:27,451
So why?

607
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,692
Because you were right.

608
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:33,481
It wasn't you that night.

609
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:37,352
If I had said you were just...

610
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:39,952
Evil...

611
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:43,700
It would be like denying
everything I do.

612
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:46,542
More than anyone,

613
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:49,623
I'm supposed to understand
that you weren't you.

614
00:34:50,306 --> 00:34:51,801
And I do understand.

615
00:34:54,957 --> 00:34:56,753
Because I'm not me either.

616
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:01,920
I hope you get better.

617
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:06,203
I hope you get better, too.

618
00:35:10,528 --> 00:35:14,062
Perfect. You give her our baby she walks
away and there's nothing we can do.

619
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:17,670
- God knows what she's gonna do to him.
- She's not gonna hurt the baby.

620
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:20,360
She stole our baby.
How can you be this calm?

621
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:22,661
Calm? I just lost a baby.

622
00:35:22,827 --> 00:35:25,121
And we're gonna find her
and we're gonna get it back.

623
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:28,412
I wasn't talking about that baby. I was
talking about the one I was carrying.

624
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:30,662
- Her baby.
- Hers. Mine.

625
00:35:30,835 --> 00:35:34,182
I know it's hard for you to understand,
but when a child grows inside you,

626
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:36,503
- you feel like it's yours.
- You're defending her?

627
00:35:36,628 --> 00:35:38,513
- I'm understanding her.
- What?

628
00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:41,790
What are you gonna say now? Because you
know the settlement's out the window.

629
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:44,261
This was never about that,
for either of us.

630
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,012
What? That's our baby.

631
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:49,580
And we'll get him back.
We will.

632
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:53,340
She's a good person. She'll look at him
and she'll know the right thing to do.

633
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,960
- How can you excuse her?
- You rush in here

634
00:35:56,088 --> 00:35:58,722
after months of being away,
and you're just happy that I'm okay.

635
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:02,000
But Amelia was there for me through
the hardest thing that I have ever done.

636
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:04,813
She tried to make me feel better
when her baby died.

637
00:36:05,445 --> 00:36:07,743
Martin, you're my husband,

638
00:36:08,565 --> 00:36:11,292
and I love you, and I am
so glad that you're back,

639
00:36:11,427 --> 00:36:12,862
but she is my friend.

640
00:36:12,986 --> 00:36:16,630
And I know... I know that
that is gonna mean something to her.

641
00:36:26,857 --> 00:36:29,430
Just watched Violet testify.
She did great.

642
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:32,363
Calm, focused...
she just said what happened,

643
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:34,902
that hell that happened to her.

644
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:39,621
And then she told the jury that

645
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:42,662
Katie was not mentally responsible.

646
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:45,681
I don't think I coulda done that.

647
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:54,913
I'm sorry.

648
00:36:58,555 --> 00:37:00,153
I love you, Charlotte.

649
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,482
I am too much woman for you.

650
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:08,192
I have more money. I picked
a specialty that makes you nervous.

651
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,290
I bought your way into the practice.

652
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:11,411
I'm strong

653
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:15,210
and I am comfortable with being strong
and I like that I'm strong.

654
00:37:15,348 --> 00:37:17,353
And if that is
too much woman for you,

655
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:20,520
if that makes your junk feel tiny,
I'm not gonna make myself smaller.

656
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:24,322
I'm not gonna put myself in a box
so that you feel like a big man.

657
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:26,453
I am a big woman,

658
00:37:26,908 --> 00:37:28,990
and you either get used to it
or you get out.

659
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:32,260
I'll get used to it. I will.
I will get used to it.

660
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:35,291
You are hot.
Strong women are hot.

661
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:38,000
It's hot.

662
00:37:42,148 --> 00:37:44,193
I mean it, Cooper.
I am not...

663
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,450
I've given you space

664
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:00,723
and time.

665
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:04,480
I've been raising our son by myself.

666
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:11,403
I quit my job to make things easier.
I did all these things so that

667
00:38:11,537 --> 00:38:13,613
you would have time
to get over what happened,

668
00:38:13,736 --> 00:38:15,081
so you could move past it.

669
00:38:15,207 --> 00:38:17,903
Today you had a chance...
you had a chance to make a huge

670
00:38:18,038 --> 00:38:20,923
step past it and make Katie pay
for what she did to you,

671
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:22,041
and you,

672
00:38:22,686 --> 00:38:24,760
What... I mean, what, what was that?

673
00:38:26,276 --> 00:38:29,562
- Did you want me to lie?
- She's always going to be dangerous.

674
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:31,961
She's gonna make someone else
believe that she's fine,

675
00:38:32,095 --> 00:38:35,261
and there's a chance she could do this
again. That is an unacceptable risk.

676
00:38:35,386 --> 00:38:38,232
After what she did to you, you...
you help her?

677
00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:40,403
I didn't do it for her.
I did it for me.

678
00:38:40,565 --> 00:38:42,861
What she did to you was unspeakable.

679
00:38:43,816 --> 00:38:45,763
And she needs to pay
for what she did.

680
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:48,442
She needs to...
she needs to pay for it.

681
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,551
I've been so in my head,
I didn't realize...

682
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:56,110
- What?
- That it...

683
00:38:57,658 --> 00:38:59,600
That it happened to you, too.

684
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:03,170
What Katie did to me
happened to you, too.

685
00:39:03,787 --> 00:39:05,480
I'm not the only victim.

686
00:39:06,118 --> 00:39:07,760
You're the victim, too.

687
00:39:08,927 --> 00:39:10,922
I'm sorry, Pete. I'm so sorry.

688
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,203
She took something from you.

689
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,231
She took me from you.

690
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,891
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Just...

691
00:39:21,595 --> 00:39:22,592
Come back.

692
00:39:26,206 --> 00:39:27,502
Come back to me.

693
00:39:31,088 --> 00:39:32,383
Come back to me.

694
00:39:34,788 --> 00:39:36,983
You have to come back to me, okay?

695
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,223
Just come back.

696
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:53,392
I don't think I could be
that forgiving.

697
00:39:53,526 --> 00:39:55,611
I couldn't either,
but good for Violet.

698
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:58,001
It's gotta be a positive step.

699
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:03,272
- You think she'll get back to normal?
- I hope so.

700
00:40:03,518 --> 00:40:06,193
- But it won't be the old normal.
- Yeah, what is?

701
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:07,570
Nothing lately.

702
00:40:11,045 --> 00:40:12,942
Which raises the question...

703
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:16,182
Charlotte King... really?

704
00:40:16,316 --> 00:40:18,662
What can I say?
You're hard to replace.

705
00:40:21,497 --> 00:40:23,691
She has some interesting sex toys.

706
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:36,731
Excuse me.

707
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:39,752
I just wanted to apologize for...

708
00:40:41,296 --> 00:40:43,290
saying that I didn't like you.

709
00:40:43,997 --> 00:40:45,390
That's an apology?

710
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:49,471
You sorry you don't like me
or are you sorry you said it?

711
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,392
Cooper likes you,
and, yeah, I just...

712
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:54,913
I wish that...
I'm... sorry.

713
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,283
- I'm making this worse.
- You know what, Sam?

714
00:40:59,408 --> 00:41:01,411
I don't need everybody to like me.

715
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:02,622
But I'm here.

716
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:04,332
You on board with that?

717
00:41:08,305 --> 00:41:10,101
Welcome to the practice...
