1
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:13,895
This Bryce guy hacks me
one more time, I swear to God.

2
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,046
- Come on, Cooper. Man up.
- Focus.

3
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,308
Come here.

4
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:20,480
That guy with the smile,
is he single?

5
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:22,087
- Come on. Naomi, come on.
- What?

6
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:25,904
That guy's the enemy. This is war.
This is men doing combat, guy time.

7
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:27,524
I'm sorry. Go, team.

8
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,461
You want to play?

9
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:32,386
Ball up.

10
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:34,200
Come on Nai,
can we please go now?

11
00:00:34,322 --> 00:00:37,272
These bleachers, they reek of
high school and...

12
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,261
urine.

13
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:40,984
I am sowing my oats.
These are oats.

14
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:44,150
These are oats that are not
married cardiologists.

15
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,200
There is nothing going on
with Noah, okay?

16
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:50,250
It was a flirtation, but
he is married, so it's over.

17
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:52,961
At least in a bar,
there would be cocktails.

18
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:55,091
But thoats wouldn't be
wearing shorts.

19
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:00,852
Nice shot.

20
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:03,901
I could kill myself.

21
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,133
She's going home with me tonight.

22
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:08,380
Come on, man.

23
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:10,821
This bastion of men being
men is being expropriated.

24
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:12,340
It's being taken over by women.

25
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:14,422
- But you like women.
- And you know what?

26
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:16,241
I'm living with one
with no sexual benefits.

27
00:01:16,318 --> 00:01:18,253
I'm sleeping with one
who's way too complicated.

28
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:20,902
And the one place where I can
just be men, there are women.

29
00:01:21,027 --> 00:01:23,072
Fellas, we gonna play, or what?

30
00:01:34,755 --> 00:01:38,011
This is like watching gladiators, but
without the killing. You know, it's...

31
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:39,380
it's very male.

32
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:45,161
Do not answer it. Do not answer...
excuse me.

33
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:50,723
I will... I'll be there
as soon as I can.

34
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:53,270
I kept telling myself
that it was nothing.

35
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:56,990
And I'm just being paranoid
after everything that's happened.

36
00:01:57,237 --> 00:02:00,073
Noah didn't want to bother you,
but then it got worse.

37
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:03,062
Temp's 103. We need to start...
cooling measures.

38
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:05,992
So what do you feel?
Any... chills, nausea?

39
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:07,013
Both.

40
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:10,833
And my heart is racing. I'm so sorry
to call you in on a sunday.

41
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,800
I hope we didn't pull you away
from something.

42
00:02:14,206 --> 00:02:15,750
A date with your guy?

43
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:24,192
She has C.V.A. tenderness,
probably pyelo.

44
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:26,853
I'm gonna start her on cephalosporin
while her cultures are pending.

45
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:29,811
You're gonna want to keep her hydrated
until she's able to tolerate P.O.S.

46
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:31,671
She's got a kidney infection.

47
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:35,532
You didn't want to just say it
like that, like a normal person?

48
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,170
I'm sorry. I didn't want to call.

49
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,421
I'm just thanking you.

50
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:41,740
That's my job.

51
00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:48,701
<i>Private Practice S02E19
What women want</i>

52
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,220
I need your help.

53
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:04,751
- It's not a good time, Violet.
- I'm sorry. I just...

54
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:07,571
I can't...

55
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,253
tie my shoes.

56
00:03:09,746 --> 00:03:13,313
My shoes a no longer visible to me,
and I would wear shoes that don't tie...

57
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:16,611
but my feet are swollen or bigger
or something, and

58
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:18,782
and shoes that tie are the only ones
that fit. And...

59
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:21,152
and I gotta go because I got the...

60
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:23,011
- ultrasound this morning...
- Stop it.

61
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,132
with Pete.

62
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:26,013
It's so weird.
I mean, I...

63
00:03:26,088 --> 00:03:28,610
know he wants to be a part of it,
but we really could be sitting there

64
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:30,480
looking at Sheldon's baby.

65
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:32,480
Vi, can I...

66
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:36,013
- can I go back to sleep?
- I can't tie my own shoes.

67
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:37,930
Okay, I'll be right there.

68
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,320
While you're up, maybe
we can get some breakfast.

69
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:43,001
My iron's low, and

70
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:45,912
they serve sausage biscuits
till 9:00.

71
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:48,782
- I know you love sausage.
- I love sausage.

72
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:54,742
That'll wake you up.

73
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:55,910
Late night.

74
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:58,382
The blonde from
the basketball court?

75
00:03:59,387 --> 00:04:00,582
She's a nurse.

76
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:03,143
Nice shot, Pete.

77
00:04:03,797 --> 00:04:05,382
Come on.
Is the dating life that bad?

78
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,581
You gotta have guys hitting on you
all the time?

79
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,080
Last one? Married.

80
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:11,180
He ask you out?

81
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:12,723
He is married.

82
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:15,673
Although he did say...

83
00:04:16,135 --> 00:04:17,231
- That...
- What?

84
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,650
He said I was breathtaking.

85
00:04:21,157 --> 00:04:23,081
Think he could make you happy
for a little while?

86
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:27,370
You have no qualms about being
with someone who's married?

87
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:30,201
It's, you know,
it's a little messy, but

88
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:32,652
just because he's married
doesn't make the feelings go away.

89
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:34,723
- I've been there.
- Yeah, well, I...

90
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:36,873
- am not there.
- All I'm saying is,

91
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:41,441
you never know. He could be
the greatest guy you ever had.

92
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:43,800
'cause you never had me.

93
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:50,440
We can ride horses this weekend?

94
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:52,060
Your day, your pick.

95
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:54,902
I'm gonna get a pony!

96
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:59,313
Not exactly the way
the conversation went.

97
00:04:59,436 --> 00:05:01,232
Women... they learn early.

98
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,513
It's Brandon, Brandon Henry.

99
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:09,990
I was a patient of yours a few
years back. I was the kid with...

100
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:11,310
who never spoke Brandon?

101
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,703
Well, it seems like I got over that
and the other problems.

102
00:05:13,828 --> 00:05:15,173
You look... amazing.

103
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,571
You'd never know that I was the kid
with the cleft palate scars.

104
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:20,061
Or the runny nose or the ear infections.
You're like a new man.

105
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,021
It's not just the plastic surgery.

106
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:23,240
That's Lyla.

107
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:27,690
I've never met anyone who had a line
like that for everything.

108
00:05:27,988 --> 00:05:30,160
I find it hard to believe
he was actually quiet.

109
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,660
Did you just come down here
to show off yourself, your girl?

110
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:34,922
- No, I got a sorehroat.
- Yeah, from all the talking.

111
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:35,650
Funny.

112
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:37,912
I have an appointment
with Dr. Bennett.

113
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:39,581
Let me take you back.

114
00:05:41,017 --> 00:05:43,883
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you, too.

115
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:46,951
- How'd you meet lyla?
- She was my lab partner.

116
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:49,921
My lab partner set me on fire.
Open up.

117
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:53,070
When he was a kid, he single-handedly
kept my first practice afloat.

118
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:55,251
His mother called him
"her little lemon."

119
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:57,381
- Really, she really called you that?
- It was true,

120
00:05:57,427 --> 00:06:00,071
even if it didn't help with the
self-esteem. Now I have Lyla.

121
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,541
You know, I bought her a ring.

122
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:03,553
I just need the nerve to ask.

123
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:07,731
Dr. Bennett,
is there something wrong?

124
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:10,151
You've got a lump
in your right peritonsillar region.

125
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:12,171
Tonsillar, like tonsillitis?

126
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:17,330
I'd like to do a biopsy on it,
though.

127
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:25,290
I think it's helping.

128
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,150
I don't feel like
I'm gonna vomit anymore.

129
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:30,473
You're almost to your second trimester.
The nausea usually lets up by then.

130
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:33,312
- How about otherwise?
- No visions, no delusions,

131
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:34,432
no crazy crazy.

132
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:36,783
I see Violet's been using
her technical terms.

133
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,680
It wasn't easy. I wasn't easy.

134
00:06:38,808 --> 00:06:41,220
It took Dr. Turner so long
to find the right meds

135
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,860
to get my delusions in check,
and then...

136
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,491
when I got pregnant
and needed to go off of them...

137
00:06:46,618 --> 00:06:49,761
It's funny, my life was on hold
for so long, and now

138
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:52,422
all I want is to be a good mom.

139
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:58,280
- Ultrasound's ready.
- If the nausea returns,

140
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:02,243
press these buttons on your wrist.
That should help.

141
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:04,440
In the meantime, why don't you work
on your breathing?

142
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:06,880
And then Violet will be back
to take you in.

143
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:15,160
So she's good?

144
00:07:15,462 --> 00:07:18,022
- She's excited about seeing the baby.
- I guess it's that kind of day.

145
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:20,741
Everyone's excited about
seeing the baby.

146
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:25,944
- My ultrasound.
- Oh, right. That's today.

147
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,511
- You did want to come?
- Of course. I look forward to it.

148
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:33,782
Go a little to the right, Dell.

149
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,383
Little more.

150
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,263
Sometimes they like to hide.
My daughter was the same way.

151
00:07:40,388 --> 00:07:41,682
She moves a lot.

152
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:43,641
I bet she's active.

153
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:45,942
My mom used to say
I was hard to catch.

154
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:47,361
Before she died.

155
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:49,600
I wish she could see this.

156
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:51,691
There. There...

157
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:53,441
we... are.

158
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:55,960
How is she?
She's bigger, right?

159
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:59,221
- Here, let me.
- It's a she. I know it is.

160
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:14,420
I'm afraid that the fetus
didn't survive.

161
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:16,143
But I can see her.
She's right there.

162
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:18,330
I'm so sorry.
There's no heartbeat.

163
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:21,241
- There has to be a mistake.
- I know this is hard to hear.

164
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:23,471
I can feel her moving right now.

165
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:26,970
- Why don't we talk this through?
- She's still alive. I know it.

166
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,512
Katie's not answering her cell phone.

167
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:41,212
I called her roommate, but
she said Katie hasn't come home.

168
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:44,372
We've got to find her. We don't know
how long ago the fetus died.

169
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:46,492
The decaying tissue
could lead to sepsis.

170
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:47,570
She needs a D&C.

171
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:50,603
You can't perform a D&C on a woman
who still thinks her baby's alive.

172
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:52,723
Maybe her body will just
pass the tissue naturally.

173
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:54,371
It's too dangerous to wait for that.

174
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,870
This baby represents everything that she
has overcome, so if I can talk to her,

175
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:59,360
- if I can separate that from the baby...
- And what if you can't?

176
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:01,452
She saw the monitor.
There was no heartbeat,

177
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:05,072
- and she still didn't believe it.
- I'll get her to understand good.

178
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:08,201
Find her, talk to her.
But, you know, do it fast.

179
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:13,362
Good game yesterday.

180
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:15,222
How come I never went
when we were married?

181
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:18,583
That's what Bryce was saying.
He said he'd never seen you around.

182
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:19,501
The...

183
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,712
the guy with the smile
and the nice teeth?

184
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:24,613
He was asking about me?

185
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:27,193
Did you want him asking about you?

186
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,112
Maybe.

187
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:31,212
He's cute.

188
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:34,570
He's real cute.

189
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:43,332
You're gonna ask me to call Bryce
for you, aren't you?

190
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:45,751
Please. Just...
give him my number.

191
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:49,620
I need some fun. You know,
I need some post-Archer fun.

192
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:52,350
- Sure. Fine.
- Really?

193
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:56,401
You are so sweet. You are the
best ex-husband ever.

194
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:57,321
I am.

195
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:02,222
- She's in a good mood.
- That's 'cause I'm pimping for her.

196
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:04,770
- I'm pimping for my ex-wife.
- Pimping?

197
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:06,891
I'm setting her up with Bryce.

198
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:08,630
- That's what I said.
- What the...

199
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:10,891
Why did I say that I would
set her up with Bryce?

200
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:13,212
- I don't know.
- I... thank you.

201
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:18,572
What is it?

202
00:10:19,997 --> 00:10:20,841
Cancer?

203
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,182
It's cancer?

204
00:10:22,486 --> 00:10:25,320
I'm sorry, Brandon.
Am I gonna die?

205
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:26,902
You're not gonna die.

206
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,542
You're gonna fight this, okay?

207
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:31,461
We're gonna fight it.
So... what's next?

208
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:34,082
- What can we do?
- We'll run a few more tests to...

209
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:37,361
stage the cancer.
Depending on how advanced it is,

210
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:40,972
we can determine the...
best course of treatment...

211
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:44,392
- chemo, radiation, surgery.
- I can't believe this.

212
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,812
I've been sick my whole life.
I thought I was finally done with it.

213
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,282
I'm 22 years old.

214
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:50,912
I don't smoke.

215
00:10:51,037 --> 00:10:54,813
- How did I get a tumor in my throat?
- The biopsy was positive for H.P.V.,

216
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:57,841
- which is human papillomavirus.
- I thought that was an S.T.D.

217
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:01,620
It is, but it can cause abnormal cell
growth, which can lead to cancer.

218
00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:02,793
Oh, my God.

219
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:05,173
It's okay.

220
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:07,330
I have H.P.V.

221
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,213
I caused your cancer.

222
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,662
Daddy can't draw a horse,
but he's taking me riding.

223
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:20,933
That's great.

224
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:25,723
Can I talk to you for a second?
Baby, just stay here and draw, okay?

225
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:31,271
Everything okay?

226
00:11:31,397 --> 00:11:33,702
Everything's good.
Really good, actually.

227
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:34,973
I got a promotion.

228
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:38,583
- That's great.
- The promotion is in St. Louis.

229
00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:40,180
She would have better schools.

230
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:42,490
She could play in a front yard
without cars flying

231
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:44,943
Which one of those makes up
for her losing her father?

232
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,450
I know I'm asking a lot,

233
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:48,271
but I want us to talk about this.

234
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:50,653
This is exactly what you said last time,
when I wanted to pursue custody.

235
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:52,830
You said we'd talk about it, that we'd
work it out, that I'd always be involved.

236
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:55,812
I want you to be involved...
vacation, holidays.

237
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:58,113
Listen, it's a fresh start, okay?

238
00:11:58,237 --> 00:12:00,500
Away from here,
away from all the bad stuff.

239
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,081
Look at my picture, mommy.

240
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:03,371
That's beautiful.

241
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:05,941
Can you go grab
your sweater, sweetie?

242
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:09,313
Go if you want, but Betsey stays.
You can't take her.

243
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:12,941
Don't do this, Dell. You asked me
to get it together. I have.

244
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,613
This is good for her.

245
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,672
Ready? Let's go.
Come on.

246
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:29,432
Unbelievable.

247
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:33,572
Late night,

248
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:35,220
now lunch.

249
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:38,070
I try to utilize
all aspects of the day.

250
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:40,143
But you...
work, work, work.

251
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:45,592
This is... Pete.

252
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:49,482
Noah's wife is a patient of mine.

253
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:55,563
I'll see you back at the...
practice.

254
00:12:57,938 --> 00:13:01,981
So I just got Morgan's labs back.
She's responding to theephalosporin.

255
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:08,702
I'm just gonna say this,
even though I shouldn't, even though...

256
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,711
You know, you marry someone and...

257
00:13:10,838 --> 00:13:12,732
you think it's love,
you want it to be.

258
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,601
You want to be a good man.
You want to be the kind of man who...

259
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:21,922
But I have never felt for a woman
the way I feel about you.

260
00:13:22,757 --> 00:13:24,650
And I know you feel it, too.

261
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:28,250
I know it, and I would never ask you
to admit it, but...

262
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,101
I need to feel at least
like I'm not crazy in this,

263
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,771
that it's not just me

264
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:36,140
making up something in my own head

265
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:37,860
so I'm not so ashamed.

266
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:43,940
I have to...

267
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,253
get these lab results
back to Morgan.

268
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,293
I didn't think H.P.V.
had any effect on men.

269
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:59,012
And we used condoms.
We were always safe.

270
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:01,850
Women get cervical infections,
and men...

271
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:05,053
People don't think of
oral sex as sex.

272
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,760
Oh, God.
I didn't know.

273
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:09,221
I didn't tell you 'cause I didn't...

274
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:10,791
I didn't think it could hurt you.

275
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:13,963
- You must really hate me.
- No, baby. I love you.

276
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:17,923
We're gonna fight this
together, remember?

277
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:21,982
So that's good?

278
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:24,573
Right?

279
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:25,803
Honey?

280
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:30,280
I was thinking that it might be
worth considering

281
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:34,402
having a hospital-based doctor
to monitor the rest of your pregnancy.

282
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:36,982
- You want to drop me as a patient?
- No. It's just...

283
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:39,420
I have such a heavy patient load,
and it's...

284
00:14:39,475 --> 00:14:41,153
it's often difficult for me
to get here.

285
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:42,951
I could find you
a great doctor right here.

286
00:14:42,986 --> 00:14:44,333
I understand you're busy.

287
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:46,503
I live with a doctor. I get it.

288
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:47,680
I just...

289
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:50,162
I thought we were friends.

290
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:53,092
I mean, who else is gonna take
my mind off my anxiety

291
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:55,463
by telling me about their sex life?

292
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:58,811
I just want you to have
the best care possible.

293
00:14:59,395 --> 00:15:01,013
Really. So I'm going to...

294
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:03,831
send over a list of names.
Okay? I'm sorry.

295
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:18,592
You got a minute?
You waiting on a call?

296
00:15:19,956 --> 00:15:21,500
I was gonna make one.

297
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:22,842
Or not.

298
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,380
It's Bryce. I can't do it.

299
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:27,362
Brandon's test results are back.
Stage IV.

300
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,761
The cancer's spread
to the mandible bone.

301
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,832
- Stage IV?
- Yeah, so we do

302
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:33,931
chemo and radiation,
see if we can attack it.

303
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:36,643
I'd go straight for the surgery.
Resect the mandible. Odds are better.

304
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:38,590
You know what that surgery
would do to this kid?

305
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:41,150
- It could save his life.
- You want him to lose part of his jaw,

306
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:42,122
wind up

307
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:45,752
- disfigured, drooling?
- His life comes first, Coop.

308
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:48,070
I realize that surgery may feel
preemptive, but

309
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,783
chances are he's gonna
get there anyway.

310
00:15:49,836 --> 00:15:51,653
His life is important to me. His...

311
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:54,292
whole life. He's coming in tomorrow
to talk treatments.

312
00:15:54,377 --> 00:15:56,673
If we can tell him chemo and radiation,
then there's some hope

313
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:58,203
of a normal life there.

314
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,083
I want to give him some hope.

315
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:07,752
Do... men not understand
the concept of a phone?

316
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:10,793
You know, how to pick it up
and to dial it?

317
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:13,153
You know, I'm out there,
I am sowing my oats...

318
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:16,790
Heather wants to move to Missouri,
and she wants to take Betsey.

319
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,892
God, Dell. That's awful.

320
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:22,230
I pushed her to get better,
and she has.

321
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:23,892
And now she has this opportunity,

322
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:27,013
and it's gonna be my fault
that she has to say no.

323
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:29,452
This is not your fault.

324
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:32,300
God, when Sam and I
were going through our divorce,

325
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:36,221
it never occurred to me that he would be
absent from Maya's life.

326
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:39,322
I'd never want to jeopardize that
for Maya.

327
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:42,742
I know. How can she think this makes
sense? I'm just gonna call her.

328
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:45,133
A piece of advice...
if you call her mad,

329
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:48,342
she's never gonna hear what you say,
even if you're right.

330
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,562
You gotta do this in person
if you want it to work.

331
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:01,883
What are you doing here?

332
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:03,861
I...

333
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:07,312
I thought we should talk,
after this morning.

334
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:09,113
That was weird, huh?

335
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:11,680
I was ally freaked out for, like,
an hour, and I then I thought,

336
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:13,393
what would Dr. Turner say?

337
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:15,632
She would say, "step back,
look at the situation."

338
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:17,811
- Good.
- And then I figured, you know what?

339
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:20,030
Mistakes happen.
Why get upset?

340
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:21,082
Look,

341
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:25,320
I got these really cute layettes.
She's gonna love this, right?

342
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:26,663
It's beautiful.

343
00:17:26,785 --> 00:17:28,940
Anyway, look, I gotta go.
I have a friend coming over.

344
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:30,800
Could we talk in the morning,
first thing?

345
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:31,703
I have work.

346
00:17:31,748 --> 00:17:33,181
- It's really important.
- Why?

347
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,423
Dr. Montgomery feels bad
about this morning,

348
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,891
and she wants to give you
another ultrasound.

349
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,193
I could see my baby again?

350
00:17:44,645 --> 00:17:47,640
And there are a few ideas
I'd like to run by you.

351
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:52,350
I'll come by tomorrow, first thing.

352
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:03,500
He's not back yet.

353
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,763
- Do you expect him back soon?
- He's getting me soup.

354
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,693
- Soup's good.
- I despise soup.

355
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,550
But it helps when you're queasy,
which I am.

356
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:15,372
Sit down if you want to.

357
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:17,681
You're queasy.

358
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:20,300
The word "queasy
makes me feel queasy.

359
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:23,841
What are you doing?

360
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:27,480
What are you doing?
That's my kitchen.

361
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,700
- Refrigerator was my first clue.
- Are you hungry?

362
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,872
Natural antacids, mineral-rich foods,
fizzy drinks...

363
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:40,240
they all help with nausea.
Now I know you hate me, but

364
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:43,160
- it actually works.
- Hate is a strong word.

365
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,201
So the baby's father...

366
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,553
is he gonna get in
on this circus anytime soon?

367
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:51,330
Eventually.

368
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:56,023
You know, one of them.
I mean, Pete or Sheldon

369
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:58,880
- one of them is the father.
- And do they...

370
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:00,413
- want to be involved?
- They did,

371
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:02,371
but now Sheldon's not talking to me,
and Pete...

372
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:06,390
he pushed, he wanted to come
to an ultrasound, and now he's just...

373
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:07,613
indifferent.

374
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:12,121
- Is that funny?
- No, I just...

375
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:18,750
I had this visual of Sheldon
wearing a babybjorn.

376
00:19:20,906 --> 00:19:22,403
Right. Pete would...

377
00:19:24,386 --> 00:19:27,910
Pete would use an indian sari
and make a sling.

378
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,020
You really think uncle Coop
would do any better?

379
00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:31,822
You know what Cooper's mother
told me?

380
00:19:31,948 --> 00:19:34,191
That when he was a kid,
he had this doll, and he...

381
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:37,640
he carried it around all the time,
and he named her Ernesta.

382
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:38,682
Ernesta?

383
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:44,800
What?

384
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,063
Something funny?

385
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:01,052
I hate breaking up with patients.
You shoulda seen...

386
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:03,521
She just looked so hurt.

387
00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:06,291
And if she'd known that her
husband had a thing for you,

388
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:09,372
she'd be even more hurt, right?
So you did her a favor,

389
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:11,980
and you kept yourself out
of harm's way.

390
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:14,902
I wasn't going to do anything,
Nai. I wasn't.

391
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:18,703
- I am a professional.
- Now it's not an issue.

392
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:25,913
You know, I know that bars are not
the best place to meet people, but...

393
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:34,441
Your friend, he...
didn't call.

394
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,531
That's weird. Well.

395
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:39,741
If he didn't call, he didn't call.

396
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:42,410
You know, there are
other oats in the sea, so...

397
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,973
Except oats aren't in the sea.
Let me buy you a drink,

398
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:46,910
- help you forget about him.
- You know what?

399
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:49,583
I think he's gonna do that
for me, so...

400
00:20:57,976 --> 00:21:01,172
- No hot date tonight?
- Ask me in a couple of hours.

401
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:04,092
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- I thought you might be

402
00:21:04,216 --> 00:21:07,393
exploring that situation
we talked about earlier.

403
00:21:08,246 --> 00:21:09,601
That was him this afternoon?

404
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:12,631
You neglected to tell me
that his wife was your patient.

405
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:15,613
I'm not going there, period.
All right?

406
00:21:15,737 --> 00:21:18,131
I even dropped his wife
as a patient.

407
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:19,912
There you go.

408
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:22,543
- You don't have to choose between them.
- No, that's not what I'm...

409
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:23,942
Can you excuse me?

410
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,181
So...

411
00:21:30,648 --> 00:21:34,711
your friend not calling Nai doesn't
seem to have slowed her down.

412
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:38,961
He may not have called because
I never gave him her number.

413
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:42,553
- What?
- I know it.

414
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:47,002
Don't say anything.

415
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,350
- You can't keep that to yourself.
- She's got oats to sow

416
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:52,451
with men who aren't me.

417
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:08,471
I'm not here to fight, Heather.

418
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:10,703
I just want to talk.

419
00:22:16,237 --> 00:22:18,880
I just don't want to lose her, okay?
So...

420
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,983
You say vacations and...
holidays...

421
00:22:24,107 --> 00:22:27,952
It's not perfect, but let's just try
to come up with a plan, okay?

422
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:30,690
Come on.
Open the door, please.

423
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,862
I'm sorry about this afternoon.
Just...

424
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:05,951
The redhead from last night?

425
00:23:07,016 --> 00:23:09,902
What is wrong with you lately?
You're suddenly after

426
00:23:09,946 --> 00:23:12,071
- anything that moves.
- There's nothing wrong with me.

427
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:14,350
- I'm just having some fun.
- Please tell me there's coffee.

428
00:23:14,395 --> 00:23:15,720
- I'm on it.
- Where's Dell?

429
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:17,983
I need him to prep a patient
till my head clears.

430
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,950
He's not in yet.
That bad?

431
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:23,342
I had four scotches, I was out dancing
until 4:00 in the morning.

432
00:23:23,465 --> 00:23:26,160
My words were still slurring
when I told...

433
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:28,303
Adam?

434
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:31,302
That it was not gonna work.

435
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:33,671
Picking up people in bars
is a bad idea.

436
00:23:33,797 --> 00:23:36,662
See, you say that, and yet you both
got drunk and had sex last night,

437
00:23:36,785 --> 00:23:38,021
whereas I went home alone.

438
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:40,530
Excuse me.
Only I did not have sex.

439
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:43,331
I went in a cab and then
I went home and went to sleep.

440
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,503
- Sleep is overrated.
- Again?

441
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:48,710
- The groupie from the basketball court?
- Redhead.

442
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:51,161
You do... realize
you're not a teenager, right?

443
00:23:51,288 --> 00:23:53,673
You're a grown man
with a potential child,

444
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:55,800
and you're gonna see
the ultrasound. So is this

445
00:23:55,856 --> 00:23:57,180
the example you're gonna set?

446
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,160
If the ultrasound is such a big deal,
we don't have to do it.

447
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:02,600
You hound me for two months,
and now it's not a big deal?

448
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:05,063
I'm here for the ultrasound.

449
00:24:05,606 --> 00:24:06,751
That's great.

450
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:08,391
That's great. I thought...

451
00:24:08,518 --> 00:24:10,263
that we could talk first.

452
00:24:10,956 --> 00:24:12,972
And... then we'll get to see
my little peanut?

453
00:24:13,096 --> 00:24:15,493
And hey, no hard feelings
about yesterday.

454
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:18,333
She's moving like mad today.

455
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,900
Violet lied to get
Katie back in here?

456
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:23,253
Can I talk to you?

457
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:26,983
You shouldn't be here, Noah.

458
00:24:27,288 --> 00:24:29,690
I am coming to you as a doctor.

459
00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:31,392
Because I did my homework.

460
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:33,521
You're the best neonatal specialist
on the west coast,

461
00:24:33,565 --> 00:24:36,043
- and I want the best for my wife.
- Maybe what's best for your wife

462
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,393
- is to not have a doctor who you're...
- In love with?

463
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:44,111
But you don't feel the same way
about me.

464
00:24:44,238 --> 00:24:47,362
And if you don't feel the same way
about me, then you can be her doctor.

465
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,581
And I can...

466
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:52,403
keep my feelings in check. I can
look at you and not think about it.

467
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:53,643
I care about her.

468
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:56,012
I don't want to hurt her.
I can...

469
00:24:56,296 --> 00:24:58,092
be professional about this

470
00:24:58,217 --> 00:24:59,800
- if you can.
- I can be professional,

471
00:24:59,927 --> 00:25:02,473
- I just think that there are
other doctors...

472
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,432
- but not as good as you.
Please.

473
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:06,650
Don't think about me.
Think about Morgan.

474
00:25:06,777 --> 00:25:09,271
All right?
She can't lose another baby,

475
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:10,851
not again.

476
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:12,682
Don't think about me.

477
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,021
I woke up this morning,
and the pain was worse.

478
00:25:18,145 --> 00:25:21,140
I'm hoping that's because I know
it's cancer, not because it's worse.

479
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:24,271
All the tests that we ran yesterday,
they can aggravate the area.

480
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,463
I know this isn't

481
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:28,490
where you wanted to be,
back figuring out treatments.

482
00:25:28,617 --> 00:25:30,341
I can handle the chemo
and radiation.

483
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:33,323
I'm so worried about Lyla.
She feels so awful, you know?

484
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:36,223
Let's just...
focus on you right now.

485
00:25:38,918 --> 00:25:40,622
Oh, my God.
What's happening?

486
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:47,773
Oh, my God.

487
00:25:50,997 --> 00:25:53,880
Sam's stopping the bleeding.
Come on. He's gonna be okay.

488
00:25:54,008 --> 00:25:56,041
I should never have let him
go to your office alone.

489
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:57,811
I should've known better.

490
00:25:57,936 --> 00:25:59,680
Thank you for calling me.

491
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:02,811
So... the tumor is up
against the carotid artery.

492
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,293
Now the surgeon is afraid that at
the rate that the tumor is growing,

493
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:09,360
that it willrode into the artery
and cause a massive bleed.

494
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:10,581
What does that mean?

495
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:13,242
- Brandon needs surgery very quickly.
- What about the chemo?

496
00:26:13,366 --> 00:26:15,480
Resecting the tumor
is our only option.

497
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,680
We're gonna have to remove
a portion of his jaw...

498
00:26:17,806 --> 00:26:19,492
He doesn't want surgery.

499
00:26:19,765 --> 00:26:20,700
I'm sorry.

500
00:26:24,098 --> 00:26:26,090
Maybe we've been focusing
too much on the baby

501
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:30,111
and not enough on everything that
allowed you to get to this point.

502
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:33,103
It's hard to separate me from her,
but...

503
00:26:33,396 --> 00:26:34,880
- okay, I'll try.
- Great.

504
00:26:35,248 --> 00:26:38,543
- Maybe start with your mom.
- When she died, it was...

505
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:40,770
It was like a pit opened up.

506
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:44,183
And... that's when
everything started.

507
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:48,830
I was so convinced they killed her,
the doctors.

508
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:51,191
- But now you know?
- That was crazy.

509
00:26:51,316 --> 00:26:54,182
I thought someone was plotting
to steal her casket.

510
00:26:54,307 --> 00:26:56,192
I went to the cemetery to guard it.

511
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:58,911
- But was that your fault?
- No... But...

512
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:01,480
Oh, God.
Why are we going...

513
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:04,173
Why are we going here again?
We... got through this. We...

514
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:05,660
got past this a long time ago.

515
00:27:05,788 --> 00:27:07,600
Right, but not everyone does.

516
00:27:07,728 --> 00:27:11,221
Not everyone fights to get their
life back the way you did.

517
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:14,010
- It's impressive.
- And now the baby...

518
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:17,891
Regardless of the baby, Katie,
you... you've done

519
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:21,843
amazing things. You finished school,
you have a great job...

520
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:26,133
- did... I say something that upset you?
- No. I'm gonna be sick.

521
00:27:34,337 --> 00:27:35,732
You're burning up.

522
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,172
Could you get Addison? Now.

523
00:27:45,386 --> 00:27:47,621
- What happened?
- She's showing early signs of sepsis.

524
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:50,291
I gave her antibiotics,
but we need to do a D&C.

525
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:52,413
What is it?
What's happening?

526
00:27:54,777 --> 00:27:56,701
I know this is not what you want
to hear, but

527
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:58,633
what happened yesterday
was not a mistake.

528
00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:00,970
Your baby died, and it's
making you very, very sick.

529
00:28:01,036 --> 00:28:02,783
It's... morning sickness.

530
00:28:02,977 --> 00:28:05,322
We could go back to your office.
You could make me feel better.

531
00:28:05,447 --> 00:28:06,432
I wish we could.

532
00:28:06,556 --> 00:28:08,900
But what Violet is telling you
is what's really happening.

533
00:28:09,026 --> 00:28:11,241
And we need to remove
the fetal tissue now.

534
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:13,131
Listen to me!
My baby's fine.

535
00:28:13,165 --> 00:28:15,332
You don't have my permission
You can't do anything to me.

536
00:28:15,397 --> 00:28:17,942
- I want to get outta here.
- Wait... It's all right...

537
00:28:18,378 --> 00:28:20,822
Let me talk to them.
I'll straighten it out, okay?

538
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:28,022
Look, she's pale, she's got a fever.

539
00:28:28,065 --> 00:28:29,783
If we don't get that tissue out soon,
she could die.

540
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:31,642
We cannot do this procedure
against her will.

541
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:33,372
You can.
You can declare her incompetent.

542
00:28:33,426 --> 00:28:35,410
She's unable to make
medical decisions for herself.

543
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:39,642
If we force this on her, if we take out
what she believes is a live baby,

544
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:42,322
she will never recover.
It will break her.

545
00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:44,223
Look, she needs a D&C. I get it.

546
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:47,501
But I have to get her to accept that
her baby is dead before you do it.

547
00:28:47,627 --> 00:28:49,313
You've tried. She can't accept it.

548
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:51,382
If you don't want to force this,
you don't have to.

549
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:54,503
Pete and I can declare this an emergent
situation. We'll override her.

550
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:55,830
You mean override me.

551
00:28:58,078 --> 00:28:59,372
This is my call.

552
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:01,581
I'll get through to her.

553
00:29:13,596 --> 00:29:15,431
- What happened?
- I can't do this.

554
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:18,762
He's gonna have
half of his jaw removed. And...

555
00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:20,991
maybe it's horrible, but

556
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:24,053
I'm just supposed to be
okay with that?

557
00:29:24,635 --> 00:29:27,782
Every time I look at him,
knowing that I did this...

558
00:29:27,906 --> 00:29:29,793
- He does not blame you.
- I blame me.

559
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:34,131
He spent his entire life trying to get
his face fixed, and then he meets me

560
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:37,291
I get that you're hurting,
but he loves you.

561
00:29:37,648 --> 00:29:39,752
Don't... say that,
don't make me feel worse,

562
00:29:39,877 --> 00:29:41,471
because I know it's selfish, but I...

563
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:44,041
You're scared, you're overwhelmed,
and you want to run.

564
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:47,982
I've been there. Bad things happen,
you want to run. But...

565
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:53,363
if you can stick it out
with somebody that you love...

566
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:55,120
It is hard to find.

567
00:29:56,258 --> 00:29:57,210
He needs you.

568
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:00,550
I'm sorry.

569
00:30:11,698 --> 00:30:13,970
- Everything okay? You were late...
- Not now, Naomi.

570
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:16,510
- Did you go and talk to heather?
- I don't want to talk about it.

571
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:17,602
Dell, you can...

572
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:19,662
I'm gonna say this calmly
like you suggested.

573
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:21,790
I'm here, and I'm going to do my job,

574
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:23,961
But I don't want to talk about.

575
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:37,302
What are you doing out here?

576
00:30:37,345 --> 00:30:39,952
My cancer patient, Brandon, has to have
a portion of his jaw removed,

577
00:30:40,076 --> 00:30:41,390
and his girlfriend

578
00:30:41,518 --> 00:30:43,643
dumped him.
She felt guilty for making him sick,

579
00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:44,873
so she dumped him.

580
00:30:45,415 --> 00:30:47,181
Sounds like she's a real prize.

581
00:30:47,307 --> 00:30:48,512
She's just a kid.

582
00:30:48,797 --> 00:30:51,081
I tried to convince her
she was making a mistake...

583
00:30:54,455 --> 00:30:55,470
You got any ideas?

584
00:30:55,597 --> 00:30:58,073
Nothing you can say is gonna make
someone do something

585
00:30:58,128 --> 00:30:59,981
- they don't want to do.
- Brandon needs her.

586
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:01,122
Brandon wants her.

587
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:03,090
What brandon needs is surgery
and to find a woman

588
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:05,401
who's not gonna run out on him
when the going gets tough.

589
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:07,993
Focus on helping them
see what they really need.

590
00:31:08,396 --> 00:31:10,690
Dot just give 'em what they ask for.

591
00:31:12,296 --> 00:31:15,190
- I know you're scared.
- Of course I'm scared.

592
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,063
Doctors trying to take my baby...
it's a nightmare.

593
00:31:18,186 --> 00:31:19,131
That's...

594
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:21,492
that's scary.
That... really is.

595
00:31:22,068 --> 00:31:23,062
But I'm...

596
00:31:23,357 --> 00:31:26,322
I'm looking at you, and you don't
look like you feel well.

597
00:31:26,376 --> 00:31:27,103
I don't.

598
00:31:27,156 --> 00:31:29,072
Do you think maybe it's more
than the fear?

599
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:31,093
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

600
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,551
I think maybe, deep down,

601
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:35,740
you're scared because you do know
something's wrong.

602
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:39,510
And all of us, when we don't know
what's wrong, we get scared.

603
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:44,053
But I'm hoping the part of you that
knows something's wrong can help me,

604
00:31:44,328 --> 00:31:45,980
because I want to help you
feel better.

605
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:48,722
I'm just protecting her,
like you would protect your baby.

606
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:50,332
You wouldn't let anyone take her.

607
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:52,552
Oh, God! I trusted you and Pete.

608
00:31:53,255 --> 00:31:54,850
You don't think I should have her.

609
00:31:54,976 --> 00:31:57,372
- I think you'd make a great mom.
- Get out!

610
00:31:57,546 --> 00:32:00,541
I am not gonna let anyone
do anything to my baby.

611
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:11,681
What a...

612
00:32:12,606 --> 00:32:13,400
day.

613
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:15,821
So your...

614
00:32:16,905 --> 00:32:19,871
- married friend came back.
- It was purely a professional visit.

615
00:32:19,948 --> 00:32:22,242
- He wants me to keep seeing his wife.
- Purely professional?

616
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:24,240
He may have some
feelings for me, but,

617
00:32:24,368 --> 00:32:26,283
you know, he's willing
to put those aside.

618
00:32:26,408 --> 00:32:30,253
I'm sure you know what that's like...
putting your feelings aside.

619
00:32:31,856 --> 00:32:33,553
- I'll play. What?
- What?

620
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:36,680
You want Violet to let you in,
you want her to do the ultrasound,

621
00:32:36,737 --> 00:32:39,061
and you're out there sleeping around?
What's going on with you?

622
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,323
What good does it do to come face-to-
face with something you can't have?

623
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:44,111
- Even though there's a baby involved?
- A baby that might not be mine.

624
00:32:43,325 --> 00:32:45,520
You're right.
It might not be, but maybe it is.

625
00:32:45,646 --> 00:32:48,350
So I should get invested now and then
have her take all that away?

626
00:32:48,476 --> 00:32:50,923
So you're
putting your feelings aside?

627
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:55,151
What... where is Katie?

628
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:57,140
She's... still in the birthing suite.

629
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,141
She needs some space, so i...

630
00:33:01,088 --> 00:33:02,813
I'm afraid I'm not gonna get through.

631
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:05,441
She's in there staring at my belly.

632
00:33:05,835 --> 00:33:07,981
I represent everything she wants,

633
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:09,802
and she hates me for it.

634
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:15,011
She doesn't hate you.

635
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:18,140
She just wants something
she can't have,

636
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:20,633
and that's hard.

637
00:33:38,086 --> 00:33:39,182
You're okay?

638
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:44,311
This little girl...

639
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:48,180
I hope she has brown hair, like me.

640
00:33:52,036 --> 00:33:54,530
- You know, let me call Addison.
- No, don't.

641
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:00,641
Is your daughter here?

642
00:34:02,897 --> 00:34:05,290
You said you have a daughter.
Is she here?

643
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:13,690
This was supposed to be a good day.

644
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:16,572
I was supposed to see her,

645
00:34:16,698 --> 00:34:18,140
my daughter, but...

646
00:34:19,435 --> 00:34:21,180
but they wouldn't let me.

647
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:24,922
What?

648
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:29,723
I've had a crappy day, too.

649
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:35,780
I went to my daughter's apartment
to talk to her mom.

650
00:34:36,215 --> 00:34:37,460
They were gone.

651
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:40,703
Moved out.
Her mother took her away.

652
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:44,170
I've been making calls
and trying to figure out what to do,

653
00:34:44,297 --> 00:34:47,393
but the thing is,
I don't think I can get her back.

654
00:34:49,056 --> 00:34:50,203
I'm so sorry.

655
00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:57,051
I know what it's like to want
to believe that it's gonna work out.

656
00:34:57,927 --> 00:35:00,431
But sometimes you need
to face the truth.

657
00:35:01,735 --> 00:35:03,080
Your baby's gone.

658
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:08,402
And she's not coming back no matter
how much you want to believe it.

659
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:10,120
I... love her so much.

660
00:35:12,398 --> 00:35:14,252
It... scares me.
I think...

661
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:17,073
I think maybe that's
why my stomach hurts so much.

662
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,691
I know you love her.

663
00:35:19,515 --> 00:35:21,862
But the pain in your stomach is real.

664
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:35,050
You know Dell is right,

665
00:35:35,438 --> 00:35:36,432
don't you?

666
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:39,652
She didn't survive.

667
00:35:50,725 --> 00:35:52,270
You're gonna be okay.

668
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:54,822
So will you.

669
00:36:05,545 --> 00:36:08,080
Dr. Pape said that you...
didn't schedule your surgery.

670
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,650
Lyla can't take it.

671
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:12,521
She can't take it if the H.P.V.
makes me lose half my face.

672
00:36:12,645 --> 00:36:14,142
I need to try chemo.

673
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:15,273
I can't.

674
00:36:15,598 --> 00:36:17,190
I'm not gonna go back.

675
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm not gonna be the freak again.

676
00:36:22,085 --> 00:36:23,762
- She's the one.
- She's not the one.

677
00:36:23,888 --> 00:36:25,700
If lyla was the one,
she would not walk away.

678
00:36:25,827 --> 00:36:27,930
- There'll be other women.
- Without a jaw?

679
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:29,651
Without the surgery...

680
00:36:30,418 --> 00:36:31,401
You're gonna die.

681
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:32,981
I don't want that life again.

682
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,403
I don't want to be that guy again...

683
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:39,953
So afraid of what
everyone might think

684
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:43,860
that I can't even
string a sentence together.

685
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:48,662
- Can't you find another way?
- The way is surgery.

686
00:36:48,926 --> 00:36:50,573
It will save your life.

687
00:36:52,078 --> 00:36:54,472
And we can't do any better
than that.

688
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:11,803
I just...

689
00:37:12,737 --> 00:37:15,771
- I just wanted it so badly.
- I know.

690
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:39,212
I think it's a little lower.

691
00:37:39,387 --> 00:37:40,383
I'm sorry.

692
00:37:55,236 --> 00:37:56,121
It's...

693
00:37:56,245 --> 00:37:57,443
It's a boy.

694
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:16,480
How do I look?
Look good?

695
00:38:17,205 --> 00:38:18,002
Hot?

696
00:38:18,975 --> 00:38:19,821
Slutty?

697
00:38:21,638 --> 00:38:23,851
- Definitely hot.
- I'm having dinner with Bryce.

698
00:38:23,975 --> 00:38:26,423
See. Yeah, he called.
I knew he would.

699
00:38:27,268 --> 00:38:28,901
- You've got Maya?
- I have Maya.

700
00:38:29,028 --> 00:38:31,100
You go and you do your thing
with the oats.

701
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:33,931
- With the what?
- The oats?!

702
00:38:34,997 --> 00:38:36,091
Sow my oats.

703
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:40,743
- Thank you for calling him.
- Sure.

704
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:42,982
You know, you...
look a little slutty.

705
00:38:43,108 --> 00:38:45,022
But maybe if you changed,
just covered up the...

706
00:38:45,147 --> 00:38:46,723
in this area here, maybe...

707
00:38:46,847 --> 00:38:47,932
Slutty's good.

708
00:38:48,058 --> 00:38:49,921
For sowing oats,
slutty is very good.

709
00:38:50,046 --> 00:38:52,120
I'm not trying to get a husband here.
I'm just...

710
00:38:51,488 --> 00:38:52,243
I got it.

711
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:55,960
You don't have to elaborate.
Cool. Then you look very slutty.

712
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:57,462
Thank you.

713
00:39:19,936 --> 00:39:20,783
What...

714
00:39:21,308 --> 00:39:23,623
- are you doing?
- what the hell's it look like?

715
00:39:23,745 --> 00:39:26,151
- I'm painting her nails.
- This isn't right

716
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:28,760
- you two, together.
- You begged me to be nice to her.

717
00:39:28,887 --> 00:39:30,780
You told me to stop
calling her names.

718
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:33,802
And I'm glad you're friends,
and I'm glad you're both in my life.

719
00:39:33,846 --> 00:39:35,883
It's hard enough to find
one good woman. I found two.

720
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,951
- Then what's the problem?
- My girlfriend life

721
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,113
and my best-friend life
are colliding in a

722
00:39:40,238 --> 00:39:43,471
womanly womanfest of
nail polish and bonding.

723
00:39:43,817 --> 00:39:46,713
You know what? I'm gonna go...
drink with guys.

724
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:49,172
You... I will talk to you
in the morning. And I will

725
00:39:49,207 --> 00:39:51,703
tie your shoes and make your lunch.
We'll talk about babies and boys.

726
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:53,760
And you I'll see...
later at your place for sex...

727
00:39:53,848 --> 00:39:55,382
lots and lots of sex.

728
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,612
- But for now, I'm just gonna go.
- You're actually living?

729
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:00,231
Oone woman at a time

730
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:01,570
is all I can handle.

731
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:03,022
One woman at a time.

732
00:40:21,278 --> 00:40:23,371
I thought about it, and I was wrong.

733
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:25,971
I made a commitment to you, and

734
00:40:26,097 --> 00:40:28,692
I'm gonna see you
through this pregnancy.

735
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:30,660
It means a lot.

736
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:34,932
You are tolerating oral fluids
and your labs look good,

737
00:40:35,055 --> 00:40:38,470
so I'll go ahead and get your
discharge papers ready, okay?

738
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:58,472
- I'm doing this for morgan.
- I know.

739
00:40:58,595 --> 00:41:00,990
You're gonna need to sign this here.

740
00:41:04,025 --> 00:41:07,653
Look, I'm sorry if I, you know,
I shouldn't have...

741
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,170
I don't know what
has gotten into me.

742
00:41:11,297 --> 00:41:13,531
Putting you in this position,
believing

743
00:41:13,658 --> 00:41:15,611
that you had feelings for me...

744
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,010
I don't know what's gotten into me.

745
00:41:24,145 --> 00:41:25,540
You weren't wrong.

746
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,692
It... wasn't all in your head.

747
00:41:33,786 --> 00:41:34,581
But...

748
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:38,692
I can't let this happen.

749
00:41:43,856 --> 00:41:47,251
