1
00:00:01,484 --> 00:00:03,119
I forgot about the adrenaline rush.

2
00:00:03,244 --> 00:00:06,006
- I know. You gotta hike more often.
- No, surgery.

3
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,174
Amazing, right?
The thrill, the high.

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,387
- I felt invincible.
- The scalpel in your hand...

5
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:12,888
- nothing beats it, not sex, not...
- No, sex beats it.

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,806
I wouldn't know, Sam.
It's been that long.

7
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:19,194
It's bad down there.
It's like some old western town...

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,649
- I can't hear you. Please stop talking.
- With tumbleweeds...

9
00:00:23,063 --> 00:00:26,317
I'm changing the subject. We still got
to... make a decision about Naomi.

10
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:29,371
If we're not gonna replace her,
I think we should at least have a talk.

11
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,071
About buying out her shares?
I was thinking the same thing, and

12
00:00:32,196 --> 00:00:35,210
I came up with a figure. I was thinking
about making the suggestion today.

13
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,329
You know what?
Even without adding someone,

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,854
we could still have another surgeon
at the practice. You.

15
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,230
The nanny had a cold.
I didn't want Lucas to get it.

16
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:07,597
Not that bringing a baby
to a medical practice

17
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:09,860
is a great way
to stave off germs, but

18
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,175
I'll keep him out of the way.
He'll be fine.

19
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:20,196
Have a good day.

20
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,023
Oh, it's you.

21
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,437
We missed you around here.

22
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,046
- You okay?
- She cried and she held on to my leg,

23
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:43,018
- and I hate it when she cries.
- We are talking about Betsey, right?

24
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,108
It's her first day at a new school.

25
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,813
She's gonna be okay, right?

26
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:49,738
I know I just got back to work,

27
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:51,903
but do you mind if I take off early,
check on her?

28
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,728
Sure. Whatever you need.

29
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,991
It's time.

30
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,680
My contractions are a few minutes
apart. I'm going into labor.

31
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:01,505
Let's get you to a room.

32
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:03,088
Welcome back.

33
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:06,882
- He doesn't even look at me.
- That is not true.

34
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:09,754
It feels like you don't look at me.

35
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:11,797
It's just...

36
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:15,323
Ever since...

37
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,679
The rape. It's okay to say it.

38
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:20,737
Sometimes that can help.

39
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,908
I think if you could work
on saying it...

40
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,616
I don't want to keep bringing it up.

41
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:27,706
- She's...
- You think if you don't bring it up,

42
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:30,079
- I'm gonna forget it happened?
- That's the thing.

43
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:31,822
It's there. It happened.

44
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,968
And if you're not able to deal with
what Collette went through,

45
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:37,656
then you and she aren't gonna be
able to move forward together.

46
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,895
I'll see you next week.

47
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:50,772
Meet me by the elevators.
I have to stop by the ladies room.

48
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,100
- I took a home pregnancy test.
- You're pregnant? That's...

49
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,973
You guys have wanted
that for so long.

50
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:05,419
You're having feelings
about telling Ty?

51
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:06,844
No, it's just...

52
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:09,517
I'm eight weeks.

53
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:13,681
I don't know who I'm pregnant by...

54
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:15,823
My husband...

55
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,244
or the man who raped me.

56
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,684
<i>Private Practice S03E04
Pushing the limits</i>

57
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,581
- She didn't even look at him.
- Nothing?

58
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,921
- She looked through him.
- She's having a hard time.

59
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:31,398
She's gonna come around.

60
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:34,081
I have a patient who doesn't know
if she's pregnant

61
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:36,215
by her husband
or the man who raped her.

62
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:40,678
Since when did you start
wearing ties to work?

63
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,764
- What's the occasion?
- No occasion. I wear ties.

64
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,100
Occasion. It's volunteer clinic day
at the shelter.

65
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,781
And I've recruited Coop and Sam
to come down there with me.

66
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:50,506
So you didn't need me?

67
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,318
- I just figured that...
- I'm seeing patients. I am fine.

68
00:03:58,286 --> 00:04:00,453
Listen, by the way,
since we're all here.

69
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:04,493
There is something we need to discuss.
Since we decided not to replace Naomi,

70
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,912
we need to buy out her shares.

71
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:11,126
- What do we need to do?
- We each need to put in $50,000

72
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,128
to the practice, and then
we'll be equal partners.

73
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:16,672
- 50 grand?
- Check okay?

74
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,507
- Check is perfect.
- I could do mine.

75
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:23,445
Come on, guys.
It's an investment in our future.

76
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,222
- Sure, whatever you need.
- It's fine.

77
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:27,447
So if we can just get checks
by the end of the day,

78
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:29,476
I'll get all the paperwork rolling.

79
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,144
I will write mine...

80
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:32,889
right now.

81
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:51,290
We have... tampons,

82
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:54,758
condoms and a sample
of birth control pills, so...

83
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:57,581
We hitched here about
a month ago from Portland.

84
00:04:57,706 --> 00:05:00,007
I tried out Seattle and Tacoma,

85
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:02,548
but I realized,
if you're gonna be homeless,

86
00:05:02,673 --> 00:05:04,345
you might as well be warm.

87
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,619
You know, it would be great if...

88
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:08,766
you and Elliot could get
checkups more often.

89
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:11,936
- There is medi-cal.
- You... need documents and I.D.

90
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,868
I could help you
track down your documents.

91
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:15,503
You know what? It's okay.

92
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:16,828
We'll make it.

93
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,409
How old are you?

94
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:23,071
- 15.
- And there's no one, no family?

95
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:24,448
Well, I got a mom.

96
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:26,335
She's out of the picture.

97
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,210
If I wanted to keep my baby,
I had to leave.

98
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:32,424
But we're good.
You know, I take care of us.

99
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:33,899
It's been hard...

100
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,435
but we're lucky.

101
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:39,996
- You know, we have each other.
- Sometimes...

102
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,871
- Look, mom.
- That's all that matters, huh?

103
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,845
He's had a runny nose for weeks.
I mean, I gave him cold medicine.

104
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,327
- It just won't go away.
- He's got a little fever.

105
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:52,142
Let me just have
our pediatrician take a look.

106
00:05:57,436 --> 00:06:00,361
This is... Coo... Dr. Freedman.
And this is Elliot. He's 2.

107
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,736
He's got a little runny nose
and it feels like a fever.

108
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,989
- Can I take a look at you?
- Come on now.

109
00:06:05,642 --> 00:06:08,442
When we get done,
you want to go to the park?

110
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,838
Let me see here.

111
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,470
- How long has he had this?
- The rash?

112
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:20,844
A few days, maybe.

113
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,132
It's not something serious, is it?

114
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,343
We should... probably get him back
to the practice, do an E.K.G.

115
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:27,658
Now.

116
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,720
I was so sure it was time.

117
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:34,102
It will be. You just...
you just have to wait.

118
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:40,649
- Your first patient back?
- False alarm, though.

119
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:43,193
I heard about Lucas,
that he's yours.

120
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:44,832
Congratulations.

121
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,560
- Do you have a minute?
- I need to get a CVS test done.

122
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:59,334
There. See? Tiny aneurysms
on his coronary arteries.

123
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,189
Blood vessels to his
heart are inflamed.

124
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:03,796
So it's kawasaki syndrome.
It explains the erythematous rash.

125
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:05,862
So this kid's homeless
with a heart condition.

126
00:07:05,987 --> 00:07:07,551
So we treat it with immunoglobulins.

127
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,735
It could help,
but it's not a definitive repair.

128
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,222
But it's the first line
of treatment, right?

129
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,394
What?

130
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,690
His mother can't even afford
a place to live, and now

131
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:18,141
she's gonna have a son
that could continue to get sick.

132
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:20,355
I'm worried.
I would like to do more.

133
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:23,511
- Like what?
- I could fix it...

134
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:25,213
A bypass procedure.

135
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,925
I know you just did surgery...

136
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,150
Wait, it was an amazing surgery.

137
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:31,044
Yes, but there's a process.

138
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,638
You can't just jump back
into surgery overnight.

139
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:36,363
The boy has a heart problem,
a heart problem that you and I both

140
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:39,208
know nobody else will touch
because there's no money in it.

141
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:43,363
- You're jumping the gun on this.
- Maybe I am, but...

142
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:47,722
I look at her, and she should be
in school with Maya, and she's not.

143
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:50,471
She's not. She's alone,
and it's wrong.

144
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:54,056
Can we run her social, get an address,
try to try to call the mother?

145
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,436
We don't know the situation.
She may be a runaway.

146
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:58,269
But she could've been abused
or molested.

147
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,457
We are not going
to put her in danger,

148
00:08:00,582 --> 00:08:04,017
but she is a kid on the street,
in over her head with a sick baby.

149
00:08:04,142 --> 00:08:05,818
Not everyone's rich
with a perfect life.

150
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,780
- What does that mean?
- I don't... it just means we...

151
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,305
- I don't know.
- Let's find the mom.

152
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:13,364
You guys...

153
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:18,904
What?

154
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,964
Why are we here? Did something...

155
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:24,447
I'm... pregnant, ty.

156
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:26,080
And... there's...

157
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,505
You're pregnant?

158
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:30,722
So I'm gonna be a father?

159
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:33,345
This is great.
This is what we wanted.

160
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,639
I know it's been awful.
I've been awful. But,

161
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,707
it's like a new start, baby.

162
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,770
We ran a paternity test.

163
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:44,433
It turns out that you're not the...

164
00:08:49,557 --> 00:08:50,557
It's his?

165
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:53,996
- I know this is awful.
- How soon can we abort?

166
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,704
Now she's not looking at me.
Now she's not talking.

167
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:02,554
Collette, what are you thinking?

168
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,729
It's awful.

169
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,669
I know it is. But...

170
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,297
we've been trying for so long
to have a baby.

171
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,133
And this isn't how I imagined
it could happen, but,

172
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,901
- this could be our chance.
- Our chance?

173
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,266
You're thinking about having him?

174
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:23,520
After that pig did...
you r... after he raped you?

175
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:26,928
There, I said it. He raped you!

176
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,510
And you want him inside you
for another nine months?

177
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:56,268
Naomi asked me to come down
upstairs for a consult.

178
00:09:56,393 --> 00:09:58,243
Do you mind watching Lucas?

179
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:01,270
I'm sorry.
I'm in the middle of a situation.

180
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:04,748
That husband just found out
his wife is pregnant by her rapist.

181
00:10:04,873 --> 00:10:07,866
- I'm way behind in patient notes.
- You have time.

182
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:10,395
Lucas will not be insulted

183
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:13,070
if you do a little work
while he's visiting.

184
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:28,922
If Violet asks, I'm here
to consult on a case for you.

185
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:31,713
- What am I an excuse for?
- So I can leave the baby with her.

186
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:34,105
Come on. I have to do something.

187
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,391
I figured if I brought Lucas to work,
she'd be forced to see him, and maybe...

188
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:39,600
I don't know that forcing her
to bond with the baby

189
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:42,868
- is gonna be such a good idea.
- I don't expect a miracle,

190
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:45,381
but maybe if she just got curious,

191
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:49,466
something to remind her that she has
a son with me. Am I crazy?

192
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:54,743
Trust me. Chocolate
cures almost everything.

193
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,933
This place is nice.
You've done well.

194
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,238
It's nice. It's a little quiet.

195
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,755
- Quiet's good.
- Quiet is fine.

196
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,080
Quiet is professional. But it's...

197
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:09,829
I don't know, it's a little weird.

198
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:12,296
Everyone's always holed up
in their offices working,

199
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,815
and I just kinda... I feel like...

200
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,009
- They treat me like...
- The boss?

201
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,177
Exactly.

202
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:22,306
- You're on my turf.
- You have turf?

203
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:26,132
Work is turf. You've got Violet.
You've got Lucas.

204
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:28,222
I'm out of the picture,
and I'm dealing with it.

205
00:11:28,347 --> 00:11:31,123
But you being here at my work?
That is not part of my program.

206
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:33,348
I will ask you to leave, please.

207
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:38,047
It's okay. I'll talk to you later.

208
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:40,368
Turf?

209
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,539
I'm fine. Just working my way
through the grieving process.

210
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,449
Denial never lasts
very long with me.

211
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:51,457
The anger does, but I'm past it.

212
00:11:51,582 --> 00:11:53,837
And frankly,
I'm too busy with work to be depressed,

213
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,105
and as far as acceptance goes...

214
00:11:56,687 --> 00:11:58,337
Well, screw acceptance.

215
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:00,715
But really, I feel...

216
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:02,963
fine.

217
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:05,545
You want to eat
some chocolate with me?

218
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:21,368
Do you always stuff your feelings
with food?

219
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:23,971
Interesting.

220
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,265
I found the mother...
Danielle's mother.

221
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:32,084
- That's... great.
- I have got Sam and Violet's check.

222
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,445
I can get yours, too,
and get it in the account.

223
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,318
- Right now?
- It's for the practice,

224
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:37,839
for our practice.

225
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,484
- I need to get the checks by...
- By the end of the day.

226
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,700
Do you need until later in the week?

227
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:46,345
A little later in the week?

228
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,362
A little later in the week.

229
00:12:48,742 --> 00:12:49,742
What?

230
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:50,884
What, Cooper?

231
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,146
Not everyone has
a $30-million trust fund.

232
00:12:58,738 --> 00:12:59,738
Forget it.

233
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:11,169
That's a lot of tubes.
Are they hurting him?

234
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:14,006
No, the tubes aren't hurting him.
That's how he gets his medicine.

235
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:15,779
He's never stayed
a night away from me.

236
00:13:15,904 --> 00:13:18,125
And if I'm not back
at the shelter by 8:00...

237
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,576
You can stay in there with him.
We'll get you all set up.

238
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:22,451
I'll speak to the nurses.

239
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:30,712
We'll... see what the... meds do.

240
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:33,987
I really think that surgery
would be a better option.

241
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:36,530
Not until the mom gets here.
I called her... the mom.

242
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:38,055
She is on her way.

243
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:40,191
Am I an ass...

244
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,047
a callous, oblivious ass?

245
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:44,865
What exactly
are we talking about here?

246
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:48,651
- Cooper called you an ass?
- He yelled at me about money.

247
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,880
- That.
- What? What?

248
00:13:51,076 --> 00:13:52,626
Nothing. It's just...

249
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:55,369
you're a rich kid.
You grew up with money.

250
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:58,395
You never had to worry about it.
The rest of us, it's not so easy.

251
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,171
But we're all doctors.
I mean, you backed me on this.

252
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:03,417
Because it's what we need to do
for the practice.

253
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,692
And it just so happens
that I could write the check.

254
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,690
So I am an ass.

255
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:13,496
You could be a little bit
more sensitive. Kind of like,

256
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:15,353
because you're this
world-class surgeon,

257
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,982
you don't see how telling me
I can't operate on this kid

258
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,114
might be cutting my legs
from underneath me.

259
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,735
- I didn't.
- Well, you did.

260
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,585
- What's going on right now?
- Faucet drip was going on all night.

261
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,463
- It was driving me bonkers.
- You decided to tear up my bathroom?

262
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,981
New marble counters, hardwood floors,
recessed lighting.

263
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:46,951
You swept me off my feet
and dragged me here,

264
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:48,782
but don't expect me
to live in a manhole.

265
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:52,485
Bulldozing my bathroom to avoid going
to work and dealing with your problems

266
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:55,769
is not cool. This is so not cool.

267
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:58,215
What are you doing home so early,

268
00:14:58,576 --> 00:14:59,726
hangdog look?

269
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:03,193
We're two peas in a pod.
Now there's dry rot that's a mess.

270
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,529
Receipts are on the table.
You can write me a check.

271
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:07,822
- For what?
- To pay for all this.

272
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:12,377
Damn it. You really
should not have done this.

273
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:20,513
No contractions,
just like this morning.

274
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:22,378
But I feel it.

275
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,298
It's all right here, and she's due.

276
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,342
My daughter?
A week overdue.

277
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,469
And I'm about to pick
her up from school.

278
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,345
It'll happen when it's supposed to.

279
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,618
But what if something bad happens
when I get home,

280
00:15:33,743 --> 00:15:36,619
like she ends up breeched or I have her
in the tub and she drowns?

281
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,979
- Your baby will be fine.
- How can you be sure?

282
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:43,087
My husband's not around. I have
tons of questions I need answered.

283
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:48,572
I paid for the midwife experience,
and you haven't been around.

284
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:52,844
Let's... let's go over
some of your questions.

285
00:16:05,851 --> 00:16:07,966
You just left Lucas sitting there?

286
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:10,154
- He hasn't cried.
- But he's awake.

287
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,638
Didn't you want to pick him up

288
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:15,163
- and play with him?
- I'm working. I'm at work, working.

289
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:19,291
You're his mother.

290
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:50,044
Charlotte is taking out her problems
on my bathroom.

291
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:53,375
She needs to be stopped.
So I need to hide this here before

292
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,200
I just can't let her
destroy anything else.

293
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:02,349
- Why are we staring at the floor?
- I've been trying for weeks

294
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:05,558
to get the blood out of the wood, and
nothing works. I've tried every brand.

295
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:07,333
That's my fifth bottle.

296
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:15,219
So... if Charlotte was raped and
ended up getting pregnant by her rapist

297
00:17:15,488 --> 00:17:18,215
and decided to keep the baby, that
would be a deal breaker for you.

298
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,042
Do not hypothetically
rape my girlfriend.

299
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:22,812
I don't. The couple, the woman that
was raped, wants to keep her,

300
00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:24,980
- the rapist's baby.
- She wants to keep the baby?

301
00:17:25,105 --> 00:17:27,706
That's just crazy, right?
I think I'm gonna tell her it's crazy.

302
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:30,393
I know it's not my job
to make decisions for people, but,

303
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:33,051
It's not fair. Pediatricians...
you get to diagnose,

304
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,854
you get to tell people what to do.

305
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:36,889
I'm supposed to just sit back and

306
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,614
- let people figure it out.
- Help them figure it out. Right.

307
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,894
The point is, it's wrong, right?

308
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:44,481
Right. I think.

309
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,902
Did you actually write
Addison a check?

310
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:04,558
Do you think it's working?

311
00:18:07,414 --> 00:18:08,920
Yeah, maybe a little.

312
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:13,658
How could she look at this face
and not melt?

313
00:18:13,783 --> 00:18:16,283
She's not looking.
I'm... out of ideas.

314
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:18,513
Was I not clear?

315
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,409
I realize you're not
a trained therapist,

316
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,606
but I would think
that a doctor such as yourself

317
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:25,353
would understand boundaries.

318
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,027
- This is my battle, not yours.
- We're not battling, Sheldon.

319
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:32,610
- Naomi's my friend...
- No. My friend. I call Naomi.

320
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,204
- What?
- No, he gets the girl.

321
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:35,697
He gets the baby. I get you.

322
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,074
You're my friend.
Now get off our floor.

323
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,692
I'll... just... I'll see you later.
Go ahead and go, okay?

324
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:43,209
Just go.

325
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:48,961
For the record, I may not be
fully over the anger part.

326
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,380
Maybe not.

327
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,925
Wait. What are you doing here?

328
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,400
- You look so thin.
- I'm fine, mom.

329
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,562
Wait. Who called her?

330
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:10,024
- Who called her? Who...
- Danielle, I called.

331
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,693
I looked and I looked for you,
but you were just gone.

332
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:15,403
Oh, he's beautiful.

333
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,864
He looks like you
when you were a baby.

334
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,583
Don't touch him.

335
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,873
- You can come home now. I don't...
- You brought her here?

336
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:26,509
- How could you do that?
- She... was trying to help.

337
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:29,167
Help? She dragged me
to an abortion clinic.

338
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:32,420
And when I wouldn't do it, she said
I had to give him up for adoption.

339
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:36,049
- I don't want her here.
- Danielle, please don't do this.

340
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,660
- Fine. If she won't leave, then I will.
- Please... Just stay...

341
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,046
You told me so.

342
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:53,992
- Let's just hope we find 'em, okay?
- I'm sorry, about the money.

343
00:19:54,117 --> 00:19:56,542
I wasn't trying to be an ass,
you know?

344
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,739
And if you're not liquid, I could front
you the money. It's not a problem.

345
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,074
What?

346
00:20:01,922 --> 00:20:05,772
I don't want your money. And
I really don't want to talk about it.

347
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,619
- How long's he been like this?
- Over an hour. It's fine.

348
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:18,926
He's just... he's hungry. He always
cries like this when he's hungry.

349
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,258
We were just too loud inside. I was
scared I was gonna get kicked out.

350
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:25,429
Come on. Be a good boy, okay?

351
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:28,581
I got some pudding from the hospital.
I took it off the trays.

352
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:30,640
- Do you think he'll take that?
- Listen to me.

353
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:33,457
If there's something wrong with him,
pudding is not going to help.

354
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:37,360
Can you let me check him? Let me...
just check him, just real quick.

355
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,191
That's a good boy.

356
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:47,862
Call 9-1-1.

357
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:51,051
Lay him here. Come on.

358
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:53,848
Just stay with us, okay?

359
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:58,711
He never came home.

360
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:01,689
I haven't seen him
since he left here.

361
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:04,721
He's working through this.
He doesn't understand why...

362
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:08,714
- Why you would consider this.
- I know. I love Ty.

363
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,007
We were...
summer camp counselors together.

364
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:13,782
We were perfect, but...

365
00:21:17,453 --> 00:21:19,053
But I'm having a baby.

366
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,669
And you really think that you're up

367
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:25,944
to putting yourself through this?

368
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:30,582
Maybe. What...

369
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:32,696
you don't think I am?

370
00:21:32,821 --> 00:21:35,221
I know you want
to have a child, but,

371
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:38,146
do you understand
what life is gonna be like,

372
00:21:38,271 --> 00:21:40,121
seeing that baby every day?

373
00:21:40,348 --> 00:21:43,719
Every time you see it,
it's gonna be like a recording

374
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,970
playing over and over in your mind.

375
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,172
So you'll...

376
00:21:48,377 --> 00:21:50,767
remember lying
there feeling helpless.

377
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,539
You will remember him
standing over you

378
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,396
and touching you.

379
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:57,535
You will remember...

380
00:21:58,063 --> 00:21:59,813
screaming your lungs out,

381
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:02,460
screaming until you're hoarse,
hoping

382
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,864
and praying that somebody
will come and find you.

383
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,310
But nobody is coming.

384
00:22:09,164 --> 00:22:11,414
And then comes the unbearable pain.

385
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,935
And then you feel
yourself passing out,

386
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,808
but before you do, you wonder
if you'll ever wake up again,

387
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:20,902
and part of you hopes
that you never will.

388
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:22,377
So all of that...

389
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:24,121
All of that...

390
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,630
will be staring at you every day.

391
00:22:27,738 --> 00:22:30,348
Do you really think
that you can look at that?

392
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:35,805
Oh my God...

393
00:22:46,057 --> 00:22:47,157
Oh my God...

394
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:50,021
Oh my God...

395
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,920
One of the aneurysms
must have ruptured.

396
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,826
This doesn't make any sense.
That medicine

397
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:04,653
that you gave me,
you said it would work.

398
00:23:04,778 --> 00:23:08,226
We wanted it to work. The last thing
we wanted to do, is put you and Elliot

399
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:11,510
- through anything more than we had to.
- But you... can fix him?

400
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:13,522
There are a few things
we could do for Elliot,

401
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:16,055
one of which is bypass surgery.
That's where we take a vein

402
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,904
that goes around the damaged vessel.

403
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,981
Or we could insert a stent.

404
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:23,057
- What's a stent?
- That's experimental in kids his age.

405
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:26,132
We put a tiny tube in
the vessel to keep it open.

406
00:23:28,314 --> 00:23:30,407
They both sound good.

407
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:34,335
What am I supposed to do?

408
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:37,790
Bypass surgery.
It's the right treatment,

409
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,909
he needs it, and I'll do it.

410
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:44,213
- I'll do the surgery.
- That sounds good.

411
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,150
I trust you. You...

412
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,660
Do the surgery.

413
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:52,096
- Can I see Elliot?
- Sure. I'll take you to him.

414
00:23:56,712 --> 00:23:59,228
I know what you're gonna say,
but I couldn't stand there

415
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:01,603
and watch that girl be so confused.

416
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:03,495
I can do this surgery.

417
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,401
It's your call.

418
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:17,092
Thanks for seeing me. I just wanted
to come by and say thank you.

419
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:20,164
- For?
- For talking sense into Collette.

420
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:22,789
She scheduled an abortion
for tomorrow.

421
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:24,741
For tomorrow. She's sure?

422
00:24:25,808 --> 00:24:26,858
She is now.

423
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:30,343
I don't know what you said to her...
she wouldn't listen to me...

424
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:31,806
but thank you.

425
00:24:41,108 --> 00:24:43,606
- Were you... looking for me?
- Pete, actually.

426
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,778
I just wanted to finish
a conversation we were having.

427
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:49,353
I had some final
choice words for him.

428
00:24:49,576 --> 00:24:52,326
I'm sorry. Violet,
I have a patient in labor

429
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:54,800
again, and Betsey's
waiting for me at school,

430
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:57,875
and I can't find Pete, so can...
can you just...

431
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:00,498
Go ahead and...

432
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,440
- help?
- Here.

433
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:05,229
Got him?

434
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:08,089
No, you can't go into labor
from burping.

435
00:25:13,486 --> 00:25:15,136
It was good to see you.

436
00:25:23,663 --> 00:25:25,565
Thank you for answering my page.

437
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,808
He's getting prepped
for surgery right now.

438
00:25:30,437 --> 00:25:33,656
Danielle could...
barely take care of herself.

439
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,902
I was always getting
her out of trouble.

440
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:38,536
She has a real
knack for making mistakes.

441
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:40,669
We all do.

442
00:25:40,794 --> 00:25:43,050
I know, but dragging
hat poor boy around

443
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:47,128
with no roof over their heads,
no safe place, I just...

444
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,673
I want better for my grandson.
I can afford better.

445
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,515
I have spoken to my attorney,

446
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,394
and after the surgery, I'm gonna
petition the court for custody.

447
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,872
- He doesn't think there'll be a problem
- Don't you?

448
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,391
Taking Elliot away from her?

449
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,519
She's a child. I'm the mother.

450
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:09,040
I'm gonna say something to
you which I've never said,

451
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:13,114
to anyone before.
And I apologize for how it sounds, but

452
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:15,507
- You're an ass.
- What?

453
00:26:15,632 --> 00:26:17,070
You're a good person,

454
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:19,327
and you're right, you are a mother,

455
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,164
but Danielle is a mother now, too.

456
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:24,207
And I believe that you want
what's best for your daughter,

457
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:27,526
but sometimes,
even when we mean well,

458
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:29,095
we end up hurting people.

459
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,050
I'm just saying,
think about Danielle.

460
00:26:32,484 --> 00:26:35,259
Think about what Danielle
thinks about you.

461
00:26:39,943 --> 00:26:41,043
Right now...

462
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:44,828
I have to think for her,
not about her.

463
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:53,281
- You're not in labor.
- I feel contractions.

464
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,657
I was sure I lost my mucus plug.
Maybe you should check it again.

465
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,938
You just need to go home,
Kimmie, and be patient.

466
00:27:00,063 --> 00:27:02,703
I can't, because it's gonna happen,
and I'm gonna be there alone,

467
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:05,266
and I'm not gonna know what to do.
I'm staying here because

468
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:07,543
I know. I don't care
what you see on that monitor.

469
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,210
I know this baby's coming today.

470
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:12,289
I'm not leaving, Dell.
I'm having my baby.

471
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:17,009
You can't force her
to come before she's ready.

472
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,698
You can't read a book
and know what's happening.

473
00:27:19,823 --> 00:27:22,693
I am trained.
I am trained to tell you what to do.

474
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:24,588
And I can't sit here
and wait with you

475
00:27:24,713 --> 00:27:27,085
and babysit you until she comes.
I'm not your babysitter.

476
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,551
I'm your midwife.
And you're not my only responsibility.

477
00:27:29,676 --> 00:27:31,984
If you can't be patient
if you can't deal with waiting,

478
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,994
are you really gonna be ready for her
when she comes, when she's crying

479
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,080
and begging you to stay, you've got
a thousand other things you gotta do,

480
00:27:38,205 --> 00:27:41,245
like I've got a thousand things I've
gotta do? You're not my only priority.

481
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,065
You need to pull it together
and be patient. Take your little book

482
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,654
and go home and don't come back
until it's really time!

483
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,690
Good luck.

484
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:59,619
You think I'm crazy for
thinking I can do this?

485
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,044
Are you serious?

486
00:28:01,517 --> 00:28:03,895
It doesn't matter what I think.
You made your decision.

487
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,111
Surgeons step up, Sam.
They don't question. They don't doubt.

488
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:09,214
They don't let other
people decide for them

489
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:10,896
what is right or what is wrong.

490
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,212
Be a surgeon or don't be a surgeon,
but don't do this. You need to do it.

491
00:28:14,337 --> 00:28:17,695
Don't waver. You told Danielle
that you could do this.

492
00:28:19,018 --> 00:28:20,018
Now go.

493
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,976
Thanks for watching him.

494
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:41,370
By the way, you're on my turf now.

495
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,303
Duly noted.

496
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:46,652
Violet really doesn't look at him,
does she?

497
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,436
- It's hard to watch.
- You could say that.

498
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,445
I'm gonna hate
myself for saying this...

499
00:29:00,526 --> 00:29:03,282
You need to come downstairs,
and you need to hire him.

500
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:05,326
You keep this baby up here,

501
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:08,537
you're gonna push her further away.
And even if you kept Lucas at home,

502
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,999
seeing you every day, that's...
that's putting failure in her face.

503
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,095
- I'm not gonna run away just because...
- I couldn't possibly.

504
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,804
You've hired a great
group of physicians

505
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:20,343
who have the sum total
personality of a hermit crab,

506
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:23,268
present company excluded.
And Pete likes you, you like Pete,

507
00:29:23,393 --> 00:29:26,097
and I can... learn.

508
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,526
Besides, how much
chocolate can you eat?

509
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:41,632
Want a drink?

510
00:29:42,664 --> 00:29:44,782
It's water, but I'm imagining.

511
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:47,201
An imaginary drink would be good.

512
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:54,494
I yelled at a patient.

513
00:29:56,105 --> 00:29:58,873
I told a scared pregnant
woman to go home

514
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:01,419
and not to call me
until the baby came,

515
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:04,054
cause I was busy and

516
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,130
I was thinking about Betsey
and I didn't want to deal with her

517
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:09,633
and I didn't want
to do my job and...

518
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:16,981
I scared a patient into doing something
I don't think she really wants to do.

519
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,105
I scared a pregnant woman
into killing her fetus

520
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,238
because I was raped,

521
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,406
twice.

522
00:30:26,696 --> 00:30:28,496
Once actually, and then...

523
00:30:29,456 --> 00:30:31,156
And then the baby thing.

524
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,431
- I'm sorry.
- This was supposed to be my safe place,

525
00:30:34,556 --> 00:30:37,896
It was supposed to be the one
thing I could still do well.

526
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:42,489
You're here.

527
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:45,012
You know, at least...
you want to be here.

528
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:46,664
You're trying to get better.

529
00:30:47,008 --> 00:30:48,724
You don't want to be here?

530
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:52,349
I like my work. But right now...
All I can think about is Betsey.

531
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:55,569
She kept begging me to stay
and she needed me and...

532
00:30:55,694 --> 00:30:57,414
and you told your patient

533
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:59,489
what you want to tell Betsey?

534
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,197
" be patient. Wait.

535
00:31:03,943 --> 00:31:05,696
I'll be there when you need me. "

536
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:08,746
that's good advice.

537
00:31:11,193 --> 00:31:14,760
I don't know what you told your patient,
but you are a good therapist.

538
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:34,475
Dr. Freedman, you scared me.

539
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:40,898
Please don't tell.
I just got enough stuff for a week.

540
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:44,864
- And then after a week, then what?
- I'll collect cans

541
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,589
or make change washing windows.

542
00:31:47,714 --> 00:31:50,234
Good. And then the month after that?
And the year after that?

543
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,022
I'm doing the best I can for Elliot.

544
00:31:52,147 --> 00:31:55,090
I'm sorry, but no, you are not.
You have a child now.

545
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:59,756
It's not about your mom and it's not
about you anymore. It's about Elliot.

546
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:02,424
And when you decided to have him,
that meant

547
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:04,171
putting everything else aside.

548
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:08,267
Doing your best for Elliot
means doing some hard stuff.

549
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:11,491
It means growing up.
It means asking for help.

550
00:32:11,616 --> 00:32:14,460
It means admitting to
the people who love you...

551
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:17,061
You're drowning.

552
00:32:23,998 --> 00:32:26,809
Went to the grocery
store the other day...

553
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:30,431
And he wanted cheese puffs.

554
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:35,536
But I couldn't get them because
I needed the money for the bus fare.

555
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:38,372
Who can't buy
their kid cheese puffs?

556
00:32:48,241 --> 00:32:49,541
You're hovering.

557
00:32:51,374 --> 00:32:52,774
I'm moral support.

558
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,560
- So I'm 0-for-2.
- With what?

559
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,176
Danielle's mom wants to help

560
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:01,911
Danielle by trying
to get custody of Elliot.

561
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,498
I tried to tell her to back off,
and then I went to apologize for Cooper

562
00:33:05,623 --> 00:33:07,484
and only made matters worse.

563
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,532
- Sam, you okay?
- His vessels are so small.

564
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,198
Damn it. I can't connect 'em.

565
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,618
- BP is dropping,
- Hand me the gerald forceps.

566
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:19,641
If I could just keep
the walls of the arteries apart.

567
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:21,874
Damn it. I can't...
I can't get the lumen open.

568
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:25,127
Sam, do you want me to call
somebody else in to take over?

569
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,547
It is okay to step aside.

570
00:33:33,026 --> 00:33:34,511
I'm calling someone.

571
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,057
You are not calling anybody.
You are a guest in my OR now shut up!

572
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,168
Thank you for saving his life.

573
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,538
He's a tough little guy.

574
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:10,923
He'll be fine.

575
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:13,539
Ms. Palmer...

576
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:18,184
Elliot's out of surgery,
and it looks like he's gonna be okay.

577
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Good.

578
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,741
Do you want to come
with me to see him?

579
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:51,190
Thank you for coming in.

580
00:34:51,443 --> 00:34:54,193
I know this is not
your regular time, and...

581
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:59,759
A therapist should be a facilitator.

582
00:35:00,562 --> 00:35:03,308
What my role is... what
I believe my role is...

583
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:06,311
is to help you decide what you want.

584
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,605
Not to impose my views on you.

585
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:11,511
When you were here,
I crossed a line.

586
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:14,942
You made me think.

587
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:17,633
But I was talking about myself.

588
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,409
I've had some things happen to me,

589
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:23,495
but they should never,
ever, impact my patients.

590
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,940
I don't know what you said, but...

591
00:35:26,951 --> 00:35:28,145
this is all good.

592
00:35:28,939 --> 00:35:30,461
We're moving forward.

593
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,737
If that's what you want,
if that's what you both want,

594
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:35,328
then that's good.

595
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:38,207
I'm just afraid that I haven't given
Collette the chance to think

596
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:39,837
what she thinks,

597
00:35:40,295 --> 00:35:41,889
to feel what she feels.

598
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:45,584
So I'm asking you
both to wait a moment,

599
00:35:45,945 --> 00:35:48,390
to step back and talk about this.

600
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:52,649
Just to think, just to be sure.

601
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,194
Because there are some things
that you can't take back,

602
00:35:55,466 --> 00:35:57,566
and this is one of those things.

603
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,954
I'm scared.

604
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:08,186
Everything you said...

605
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,160
That's how I feel.

606
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:13,353
But when you first came in,
you were feeling other things, too...

607
00:36:15,077 --> 00:36:16,118
Joy...

608
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,091
Hope.

609
00:36:18,874 --> 00:36:22,429
Let's put those things into words, too,
so you can move forward, together.

610
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:43,742
I hate this...

611
00:36:47,684 --> 00:36:49,584
That I couldn't protect you.

612
00:36:50,116 --> 00:36:51,116
I know.

613
00:36:51,474 --> 00:36:52,474
I know.

614
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,300
But...

615
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:01,649
What do you want to do?

616
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,765
I am a pregnant woman.
I am nine months pregnant.

617
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,857
Look in the book...
hormones out of whack,

618
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,484
emotions all over the place,
and so I'm freaked out.

619
00:37:17,814 --> 00:37:20,045
And you, the person who's
supposed to be my support,

620
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,348
question me whether
I know what I'm ready for?

621
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:25,136
I am ready for this.
This is everything that I want.

622
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:27,961
The only one
that I'm worried about is you.

623
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:31,540
You're right. I was out of line
and unprofessional.

624
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,668
I'm the one who needs to be
more patient, and I'm sorry.

625
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,790
I just peed myself.

626
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,778
I hate being pregnant.

627
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:44,195
God.

628
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:47,099
What, this is funny? Pee is funny?

629
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,703
It's not pee. Your water just broke.
It's time.

630
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:53,583
- Really, it's time?
- Relax. I got you covered.

631
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:54,708
All right?

632
00:37:58,512 --> 00:38:00,962
Charlotte,
get your butt out here now.

633
00:38:01,795 --> 00:38:04,656
- You did not just say that to me.
- I'm broke.

634
00:38:04,977 --> 00:38:06,783
- Broke?
- I'm broke.

635
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,411
I need 50 grand to buy out
Naomi's shares. I don't have it.

636
00:38:09,732 --> 00:38:12,289
And I am humiliated
that I don't have it.

637
00:38:12,842 --> 00:38:15,903
But you're my girlfriend. So you need
to know about these things...

638
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,085
- I guess.
- You're a doctor.

639
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,900
- How can you be broke?
- Pediatricians make less money.

640
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:26,250
I'm spoiled.
I'm spoiled, and I like porn.

641
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:28,709
I've paid way too much
money for porn in my life,

642
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:31,864
and I think fast cars are good
and shiny electronics make me happy.

643
00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:33,589
I'm a 12-year-old boy,

644
00:38:33,904 --> 00:38:36,335
and I never planned for
next week or next month.

645
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,460
And now I have to deal with that.

646
00:38:52,437 --> 00:38:54,454
So could you go find
something else to do

647
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:57,479
besides tear up my bathroom
and make me broker?

648
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:06,866
I'm telling you... surgery.

649
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:10,973
I forgot what it felt like
to be a godlike, arrogant... ass.

650
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:15,238
Funny.
You're a funny, funny man.

651
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:17,113
Sometimes an ass is good.

652
00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:23,466
- I shouldn't have doubted you.
- I shouldn't have doubted myself, so

653
00:39:23,735 --> 00:39:24,736
we're even.

654
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:26,822
Cheers.

655
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:30,711
Can I come in?

656
00:39:31,734 --> 00:39:35,303
Don't worry. I'll be quick.
I'm here to discuss the buy-in.

657
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,020
Here's your check for
50 grand for Cooper

658
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,626
and a blank check for me.

659
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,237
Write in whatever number
you need. I want in.

660
00:39:42,362 --> 00:39:43,880
You want to work here?

661
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,864
Is there something in
this besides alcohol?

662
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:49,011
Stop looking at me like
I've lost my scruples.

663
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,804
I haven't.
I believe in whole wellness, too.

664
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:52,929
Whatever.

665
00:39:53,054 --> 00:39:54,891
Does Cooper know you're doing this?

666
00:39:55,156 --> 00:39:57,206
You let me take care of Cooper.

667
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:05,929
I'm not in the mood to fight, Pete.

668
00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:07,874
I know I don't have a client, but...

669
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:09,199
it's not fair,

670
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,283
me throwing Lucas in your face.

671
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:15,002
But if I stay here,
I'm going to want to. So...

672
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:20,434
I'm taking a job at pacific
wellcare with Naomi.

673
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:29,393
I'm sorry it's so hard for you.

674
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:32,429
I am.

675
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,696
He was supposed to wait for me
to get better, not walk out.

676
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:46,234
I just needed time, Cooper.

677
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,730
That's all... time.

678
00:40:47,855 --> 00:40:50,161
So I thought to myself,
well, I'll give him Lucas.

679
00:40:50,286 --> 00:40:53,247
I'll get myself together if
I just had a little time.

680
00:40:54,643 --> 00:40:57,079
And I say this with love,
but you did push him away.

681
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:59,685
Of course I pushed him away.
I needed some space.

682
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:03,038
Not this amount of space.
But, you know, what is it with people?

683
00:41:03,163 --> 00:41:05,435
You push 'em away,
and they just don't get it.

684
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,447
And you know what pisses me off
the most is this stain remover?

685
00:41:08,572 --> 00:41:10,622
It is 40 bucks, and it is crap!

686
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:35,283
It's gonna get better.

687
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:36,575
When?

688
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:40,064
When?

689
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:50,179
