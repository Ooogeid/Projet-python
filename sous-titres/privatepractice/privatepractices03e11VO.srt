1
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:30,127
Can I go to school now?

2
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:45,810
(elevator bell dings)

3
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:03,694
I'm very good
at accepting apologies, mark.

4
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:07,498
I apologized
over the phone.
"fine. I'll bring her
to l.A." is not an apology.

5
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:10,334
Wh-what is that?
That's just a shadow.
That's the baby.

6
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:12,737
Where's the a.T.M.?
A.V.M., sweetheart.

7
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:16,273
A.T.M. Is where
you get money.
You're not gonna see
the a.V.M. Here.

8
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:19,043
That's just a cluster
of blood vessels.
That aren't supposed
to be there,

9
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:22,680
And if you pop them,
I'm gonna die?
W--no.
Um, sloan, it's just

10
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:25,216
A tangled cluster of
blood vessels under the baby.

11
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,118
I'm not gonna go
anywhere near them,

12
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:29,353
So I won't be popping them.

13
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:31,689
I'm gonna go in,
uh, laparoscopically

14
00:01:31,723 --> 00:01:35,259
And very carefully cut
one of the amniotic bands

15
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:38,262
From around the baby's legs.
And then he'll be okay?
He'll be able to walk?

16
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:40,598
Then he'll be perfect.
Well, that's what
you said last time.

17
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:42,733
That was my fault, sloan.

18
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:46,103
<i>I shoulda let her finish
the surgery the first time.
Now that is an apology.</i>

19
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:48,372
What is that? What is
that thing right there?

20
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:51,475
Is that something growing
out of his head?
That is a penis.

21
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,944
Sloan, you're gonna make
yourself crazy

22
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,913
Trying to read the ultrasound.

23
00:01:55,947 --> 00:01:58,082
Has her blood pressure
always been this high?

24
00:01:58,116 --> 00:02:00,718
Yeah, it's been going up.
She's scared.

25
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,821
So am I.

26
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:05,389

Pete wilder, mark sloan.

00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:16,529
Hi, good to meet you.
Mm-hmm.

30
00:02:16,563 --> 00:02:18,998
And this is sloan,
mark's daughter.
Sloan sloan?

31
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:21,033
Sloan riley.
She got her mom's
last name.

32
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:23,736
Oh, okay. Well, sloan,
dr. Montgomery asked me

33
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,138
To help you try
to calm down a little.

34
00:02:26,173 --> 00:02:28,574
She says you're nervous
about your surgery.
What is he, a pharmacist?

35
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:30,943
No, alternative medicine.
Dude, you are not putting
those needles in me.

36
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:34,146
Most people barely feel it.
Dude, you heard her. You're not
putting those needles in her.

37
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:36,682
Dude...
Pete is doing me a favor.

38
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:39,685
With respect, I didn't bring
my daughter down here

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,187
For witch doctoring.

40
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,621
With respect, really?
Mark.

41
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:44,790
What kind of medicine
do you practice?
Pltics.

42
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:47,226
(laughs)
what are you laughing at?

43
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,995
Ah, nothing. Saving the world
one boob job at a time.

44
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,366
Hey, listen, pal--
okay, okay. Look, enough. Pete,
you're gonna do your thing.

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,368
Mark, you're gonna let pete
do his thing.
No, I'm not gonna let pete--

46
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:57,002
Oh, yes, you are.
I'm in charge here.

47
00:02:57,037 --> 00:03:00,606
<i>And if you want me to do this
surgery again, then you're gonna</i>

48
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,378
Follow me out of this room
right now. Let's go., mark.

49
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:17,390
Hi, dr. Cooper.
Hey, cody.

50
00:03:17,424 --> 00:03:19,992
Is your mom home?
Oh, she ran
to the post office.

51
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:22,495
She'll be ho soon.
Could we wait inside?

52
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:24,997
My mom's a super good mom.

53
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,433
I know.
She's super nice.

54
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:30,803
I know. I've met her. You trying
to fix us up or something?

55
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:33,038
No. I just...

56
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:34,974
Okay, come in.

57
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:46,118
All right. Follow me.

58
00:03:46,153 --> 00:03:49,321
Just be careful you don't
knock over any piles.

59
00:03:57,531 --> 00:04:00,299
(saw whirs)

60
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,736
So, uh, your mom likes
to hold on to stuff, huh?
She's a super good mom.

61
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,739
I know. You said that.
I was thinking maybe

62
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:10,276
One of the reasonsou wanted me
to come here was so I could see

63
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,445
How much stuff she keeps.
(woman) cody.

64
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,813
Oh.

65
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:16,849
Oh, my god. Dr. Freedman,
what are y--what are you doing?

66
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:18,617
The itching
wakilling me, mom.

67
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:21,287
I was gonna go crazy.
Cody, I would' taken you
to the doctor.

68
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:23,355
I know, but...
Dr. Freedman,

69
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,826
I-I know what you
must be thinking.
No, I'm thinking that, uh,

70
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,628
We're gonna have to take cody
to the hpital.
What? Why?

71
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:32,531
Well, he's got a-a skin
infection, a ptty bad one.
Oh, god.

72
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:34,567
Cody, you can't scratch that,
okay?

73
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:37,369
Do you want to take him in
your car, you can meet me there?
Yeah. Yes, thank you.

74
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,871
Mm-hmm.
Thanks so much.

75
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:40,973
Do you want to take him in
your car, you can meet me there?
Yeah. Yes, thank see you there.

76
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:42,842
She's crazy cakes!
That's your diagnosis?

77
00:04:42,876 --> 00:04:45,811
<i>Crazy cakes. There is
broken crap piled everywhere.</i>

78
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:47,646
And I'm not just
talking unsanitary.

79
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:50,249
<i>I am talking insane.
Okay. Well, it sounds like
she's a hoarder.</i>

80
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:52,685
That--that's an obsessive-
compulsive disorder, coop.

81
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:54,086
Maybe it's genetic.

82
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,555
Maybe it was triggered
by a trauma or loss.

83
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,492
Or we could go
with crazy cakes. (laughs)
if you had seen this place,
you would.

84
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:01,060
Okay. Well, I will
talk to her.

85
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:03,462
It's actually
a very hard disorder to treat.

86
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:06,966
But, uh, I'll do the best
I can. How's the kid?
The kid is smart.
The kid is articulate.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,001
I honestly thought maybe
he had called me there

88
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:11,337
As a cry for help so I could
see this, but he's got

89
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:13,839
What I'm pretty sure is
a staph infection on his arm,

90
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:16,008
So maybe he just needed
that cast off.

91
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:17,843
I've got him at st. Ambrose
for the arm,

92
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:20,679
And he is staying there
until that house is clean.
Well, that might take
some time.

93
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:22,448
Okay, but if it takes
too much time,

94
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:25,784
I'm calling
child protective services.
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

95
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:28,988
Hey, coop. How's it going
with charlotte?
I can't forgive her.

96
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:31,223
I'm trying, but I just...

97
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:34,059
I can't seem to forgive her.

98
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,165
What is the matter with you?
Me? What's the matter
with you?

99
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,269
You're as wound up
as I've ever seen you.
I am not the one

100
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:46,605
Starting schoolyard fights
with other doctors.
You're wound up, addie.
Just admit it.

101
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,807
Bizzy's a lesbian.
What?

102
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:50,976
My mother--she's a lesbian,

103
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:52,978
Which means the captain
wasn't a cheater.

104
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:55,047
It was all a sham--
my whole childhood.

105
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:57,349
Everything I believed about
my dad, my mom, love, marriage--

106
00:05:57,384 --> 00:05:59,151
It's all turned on its head.

107
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:02,588
So, yeah, I'm a little...
Wound up.
Wow.

108
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:04,723
Your turn.

109
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:06,125
Lexie dumped me.

110
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:07,526
Oh.

111
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:10,062
I asked her to raise
sloan's baby with me.

112
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:12,431
Or, you know, raise it
th me and sloan.

113
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:15,234
She's a little young for that,
don't you think?
Do not take her side.

114
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:17,603
I'm sorry.
It sucks.

115
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:19,004
(sighs) yeah.

116
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,707
Your thing sucks, too.

117
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:23,175
Bizzy's a lesbian?

118
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:25,611
Thank you.

119
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:27,012
(sighs)

120
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:32,051
(exhales deeply)
when did we get so--

121
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:33,619
Old?

122
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:35,654
I was gonna say sad.

123
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:37,990
When did we get so sad?

124
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:39,058
(sighs)

125
00:06:39,092 --> 00:06:40,960
Don't you wish
we did heroin?

126
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:43,963
Addison forbes montgomery-
no, no, I mean,
don't you wish we did drugs,

127
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:47,032
Drank too much,
shot something into our vein?

128
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:50,035
I mean, nothing, you know, that
would make you ruin your life

129
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,271
Or kill you or make yos

130
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:54,673
And say, "hi, I'm addison.
And I'm an alcoholic."

131
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,141
But just... (sighs)

132
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:57,376
(chuckles)

133
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,411
You know, nai--she eats.

134
00:06:59,446 --> 00:07:01,647
She puts food on top of it,

135
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:04,083
And that numbs the pain,

136
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:06,518
The malaise,
the--the--the sad.

137
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:09,588
I mean, she puts food on top
of it, and she feels good.

138
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:11,657
But I... I don't...

139
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:13,225
I have green juice.

140
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,227
I mean,
that's all I really like.

141
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:18,297
And green juice, I can't really
put that on top of it.

142
00:07:18,331 --> 00:07:21,066
I wa to put something
on top of it,

143
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:22,401
But I don't have anything.

144
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:28,474
And I hear you.
Numb the pain.
Mark, what are you doing?
I'm telling you what--feel.

145
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:32,211
Numbhe sad. Feel good.
Put someing on top of it.

146
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:34,580
Mark, I said put something
on t of it,

147
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:37,016
Not put you on topf me.

148
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,320
My life is in ruins.
It's a mess.

149
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:44,556
I'm about to be
a grandfather,

150
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:45,824
And I'm alone.

151
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:49,528
I don't know of a lot
of surefire ways

152
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:51,697
To numb the pain,

153
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:53,265
But I do know one.

154
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,267
Now... Do you want
to feel better

155
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:56,902
Or don'tou?

¶ walk outside ¶

164
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:17,056
¶ let's take a walk ¶

165
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,657
(giggles)

166
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:22,227
(gasps)

167
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:23,595
Oh.

168
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,963
Yes.

169
00:08:25,612 --> 00:08:27,380
(addison) oh, my god.
(mark) oh.

170
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:28,848
I...
(gasps)

171
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:31,084
(laughing) I can't
catch my breath.

172
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:33,619
Well, we could call in
the dude with the needles...

173
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:35,688
(laughs)
to help calm you down.

174
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,825
(both laughing)

175
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,496
Oh. I forgot
how much fun you were.

176
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,933
(sighs) yeah, well,
that's what happens...

177
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:48,868
(laughs)
when you date children.

178
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:51,404
You forget what it's like...
(whispers) to be with a woman.
Hey.

179
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:53,239
(smacks buttocks)
(normal voice) oh!

180
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:55,375
No being mean about lexie.
(laughs)

181
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,743
Did you just spank me?

182
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:59,579
Oh, what, what, you want
to start something?
Maybe.

183
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:01,914
Come on. Bring it, sister.
I will, right now, dr. Sloan.

184
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,783
Oh, I'll give you
more of the same.

185
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:05,752
(smacks buttocks)
really? Oh! My god. (laughs)

186
00:09:05,786 --> 00:09:07,887
Addi--aah.
Oh!

187
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:10,256
Sam, close the door!
Addison, this is
a place of business.

188
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,060
Uh, sam, will you, uh, just
toss me that shirt there, buddy?

189
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:18,264
Sam, close the door.

190
00:09:18,298 --> 00:09:21,300
Hey.
Oh, my god.

191
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:23,803
Sloasloan went right to sleep.
The needles worked wonders.

192
00:09:23,837 --> 00:09:25,338
Thanks. Great job, dude.

193
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:27,106
Okay, then.

194
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:29,208
Too bad I joined
the other practice.

195
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:31,844
This place has perks.

196
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,480
(lowered voice)
sam, close the door!

197
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,017
I keep everything of cody's

198
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:40,086
Because he might want it
someday.

199
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,854
Report cards, trophies.

200
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:43,823
Mm-hmm. Yeah, and there's
other stuff that,

201
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:46,159
You know, needs to be donated
to goodwill or somewhere.

202
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:48,161
Have you called anybody
about comio pick it up?

203
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:51,731
You know what? I haven't
gone through all of it just yet.
Do you need help
doing that?

204
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:55,334
I know how overwhelming it could
be to be a single parent.

205
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:57,637
Well, it was easier
when his dad was alive,

206
00:09:57,671 --> 00:10:00,173
But cody and I are, uh,
we're okay now. We do fine.

207
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:03,342
When did he die?

208
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:07,246
Three years ago.
I'm sorry. What happened?

209
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,582
I know that you want to help,

210
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:12,485
But honestly, I don't need...
Any help.

211
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,589
Cody and I are just fine.

212
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:18,858
(clears throat)

213
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,730
You get 30 seconds.
I'm sorry?

214
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:27,233
We are business partners,
so you get 30 seconds

215
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:29,402
To lecture me
on my business practices.

216
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:31,771
But if you start to lecture me
on something not related

217
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:34,974
To my business practices, I will
walk away. Those are the rules.

218
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:37,910
Oh, sour friendship
has rules now?
No. We're not talkingas.

219
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:40,179
We're talking
as business partners.
Well, I want to talk
to my friend.

220
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:43,416
She doesn't want to talk
to you right now.
So now you're talking about
yourself in third pe.

221
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:46,018
Hi. Did you sleep
with mark sloan

222
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:48,054
On the floor of your office?
Yep.

223
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:49,856
Sam--
and she's making up rules

224
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,391
And she's talking about herself
in third person.
Yes, I am, because I have

225
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:55,461
Earned that right.
When you have gone through

226
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:57,763
What I've gone through with
my family, you have the right

227
00:10:57,798 --> 00:11:00,566
To be a little eccentric
for a few weeks.

228
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:02,401
You have the right
to refer to yourself

229
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:05,404
In the third person and have sex
on the floor of your office

230
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,474
And apply random rules to old
friendships. You have the right.
(pounds on countertop)

231
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:11,010
(pounds on countertop)
okay. All right, sam.
You need to leave addison alone

232
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:12,879
Because you're
making her scream.

233
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:15,548
Addison, I am here for you
if you need me.

234
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:18,784
You see that?
That is a friend.
Okay. (scoffs)

235
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:21,921
Okayyou came to me and youre up,

236
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:24,490
You were a little desperate,
and I turned you down.

237
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,926
Now I turned you down
because I am a good person.

238
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,829
Mark sloan had you naked within
an hour of his arrival.

239
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:32,265
Now what does that
say to you?

240
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:36,302
Addison.
You broke the rules.
I'm walking away.

241
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:39,472
(indistinct conversations)

242
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,811
Relative harmony?

243
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:49,749
Well, as long as betsey's
not with me, she seems fine.

244
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:51,250
She'll come around.

245
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:52,652
She hates me.

246
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:55,888
Maya hates me
for no disrnible reason.

247
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:57,990
Try not to
take it personally.

248
00:11:58,025 --> 00:11:59,926
Doughnuts help.

249
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,928
I'm not the one
who blew up the house.

250
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:03,996
I'm not the one
with the drug habit.

251
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:05,965
And I lost someone, too.

252
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:08,301
I went through
a trauma, too.

253
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:09,869
Dell, she's 7.

254
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:11,637
I know, I know.

255
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:13,539
She's 7.

256
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:15,741
I know.

257
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,643
Hoarding is a mental illness,
cooper.

258
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:20,680
I can't just tell her
to snap out oft.
No, but you can get
a dump truck

259
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:24,417
Ck it up
and start shoveling.
Then she's just gonna start with
the behavior all over again.

260
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:27,887
I need some time to get
to the root of the problem.
He doesn't have time.
He's got staph eating his arm.

261
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:30,623
Which could happen in
a clean house. You know that.

262
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:33,159
And you're treating it
at st. Ambrose.
Yeah, and charlotte's
gonna slice me

263
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:35,127
For using one of her
precious beds for someone

264
00:12:35,162 --> 00:12:37,964
That's not
on death's door, so--
for god sake, cooper. A patient
needs a bed, admit him,

265
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,132
But don't keep blaming me for
everything. It's getting old.

266
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,401
If andrea doesn't start
throwing stuff

267
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:46,339
Out the front door tomorrow,
I'm calling d.C.F.S.

268
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:50,710
How long is he gonna
keep punishing me?

269
00:12:50,744 --> 00:12:52,878
'cause I'm about to stop
forgivin' and forgettin'

270
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:55,114
And get real nasty.

Do you ever get used

(addison and sam) no.

274
00:13:02,556 --> 00:13:06,325
So... You're doing
the surgery tomorrow, right?

275
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,528
I am going to do
the surgery tomorrow.
(mark) this is so beautiful.

276
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:13,299
Isn't it beautiful?
And everything's gonna be okay,
right, after the surgery?

277
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,768
Yes.
I've always wanted
to learn to surf.

278
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:17,870
Do you want to learn
to surf?

279
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:19,972

Good night.

282

I mean, do you ever

283
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:30,983
Mark, that little girl is not
ready to be a mother.

284
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,852
How's she gonna handle it
the first time

285
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:35,021
The baby spits up in her mouth?
I'm gonna be there with her,

286
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:37,023
Every step of the way.
(sam chuckles) really?

287
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:39,291
How are you gonna handle
spit up in the mouth?

288
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:40,793
It happens quite frequently.

289
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,828
I can handle it.

290
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,331
I grew up, you guys.

291
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:47,166
You all ran off
to live on the beach,

292
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,703
And...
I went and grew up on you.
Okay, now that's just
crazy talk.

293
00:13:50,737 --> 00:13:52,672
I think I might move here.
What?

294
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,373
What?
(naomi) what?

295
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:56,876
I could join your practice.
This is l.A.

296
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,211
I'm a plastic surgeon.
I'd bring in a fortune.

297
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:02,214
And you could help me
raise the baby.
(laughs)

298
00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:04,450
(laughs)
are you out of your mind?

299
00:14:04,484 --> 00:14:07,153
Please tell me you're not...
Serious.

300
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:10,056
Addison and I are good together.
Tell him.

301
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,824
Mark...

302
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,125
Lexie...

303
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,394
Like you said,
she's a kid.

304
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:17,963
But you. You know me.

305
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:20,499
You get me.

306
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:22,334
You all do.
You're my friends--

307
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:25,037
My old friends,
my good friends.

308
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,307
And this?
This feels right.

309
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:31,077

You hungover?

312
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:39,574
You were the one
who was drunk, not me.

313
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:42,377
I wasn't the one talking about
moving my whole life down here.

314
00:14:42,412 --> 00:14:44,313
That wasn't drunk talk, addison.
Oh, come on, mark.

315
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:46,248
Let's not talk about it.

316
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:48,784
I want you focused
on the surgery.
Montgomery.

317
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:52,220
How ng you gonna need
o.R. Three?
Uh, two hours tops.

318
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:53,889
Good. Who's hot stuff?

319
00:14:53,923 --> 00:14:57,459
Uh, um, dr. Charlotte king,
dr. Mark sloan.
Plastics.

320
00:14:57,493 --> 00:14:59,161
Sexology.
Sexology.

321
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:01,029
Mm-hmm.
My god. I love l.A.

322
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:03,965
I was just telling addie
I could be persuaded

323
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,202
Into relocating
if the situation were right.
I've been saying we need
a plastics guy.

324
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:09,204
Haven't I been saying
we need a plastics guy?
Oh, god.

325
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:11,173
Well, we'll talk, right after
my daughter's surgery.

326
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:14,109
Actually, you can talk now
on your way out.

327
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:15,510
On my way out?

328
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:18,146
Yeah, you're not allowed
within 1,000 feet of my o.R.

329
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:20,248
And don't let him join
the practice

330
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:22,384
While I'm in surgery.

331
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:25,921
(violet) thank you
for letting me come see you.

332
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,789
Do you remember
when this first started,

333
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:30,592
This, uh, need
to keep everything?

334
00:15:30,626 --> 00:15:32,861
Cody made at.

335
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:38,767
Did it have anything to do
with the death of your husband?

336
00:15:42,138 --> 00:15:45,741
Cody will grow into this
in a few years.

337
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:47,242
These erasers--

338
00:15:47,276 --> 00:15:50,612
They are all still good.
(chuckles)

339
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:52,414
This can be repaired.

340
00:15:52,448 --> 00:15:56,118
How would your life be different
if you threw this out?

341
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:58,420
I need it.
Why?

342
00:15:58,454 --> 00:16:00,055
Because you never know...
(chuckles)

343
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,556
When you're gonna
need something.

344
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:04,493
And then if yothrow it out,
you don't have it anymore.

345
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:07,796
(chuckles) I'm not crazy.
Maybe I'm a little eccentric.

346
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,765
I know what people think.

347
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:12,200
But I'm not crazy.

348
00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:17,639
Surgical time-out's complete.
Let's prep the belly.

349
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:20,809
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

350
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:23,712
Sam.

351
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:26,281
Is everything okay?
Everything is perfect,

352
00:16:26,315 --> 00:16:28,784
'cause you can't
walk away from me in here.

353
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:30,652
Look who's making up
the rules now.

354
00:16:30,686 --> 00:16:32,120
I am at work, sam.

355
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:34,156
You're really
going to talk about

356
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,458
My very, very personal life
while I'm at work?

357
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:38,627
No. No, no, no.
Hello, everyone.

358
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:42,931
(surgical team
speaks indistinctly)
I am going to talk to you
about dogs.

359
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:44,766
(sighs)

360
00:16:46,436 --> 00:16:47,869
(door opens)

361
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:50,071
Where's my mom?
Why isn't she here?

362
00:16:50,106 --> 00:16:52,140
She's on her way.
How you feelin'?

363
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:54,376
I want to go home.

364
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,111
Yeah, I bet.

365
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:59,014
Hey, um,
I have a question for you.

366
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:01,917
Do you have any family
around here,

367
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,318
Any aunts, uncles?

368
00:17:03,352 --> 00:17:05,020
No, why?

369
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:08,023
Well, I'm working with your mom
on cleaning your house up,

370
00:17:08,057 --> 00:17:10,158
And it'd be better

371
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:13,962
If you had someplace else
to stay for a while.
No, I need to be with her.
I take care of her.

372
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:16,665
Well, would you like that
to be different?

373
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:18,900
You don't understand.

374
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:21,369
Sh-she needs help, cody.

375
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:23,872
She needs more help
than you can give her.

376
00:17:23,906 --> 00:17:26,575
And this separation
would only be temporary.

377
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:29,911
You can't do that.
She'd be...

378
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:33,849
It'd be like when my dad
and my sister died.

379
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:36,418
Do you mind
if I ask you about that?

380
00:17:40,623 --> 00:17:42,457
My dad had us weekends.

381
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:44,593
So they were divorced?

382
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:48,263
I was sick, so it was
just my sister that Friday.

383
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:55,203
They ran off the road
in latigo canyon.

384
00:17:55,238 --> 00:17:58,874
I have to stay with my mom.

385
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:01,510
And then you have
golden retrievers.

386
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:03,411
Now golden retrievers,
like labs,

387
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:05,580
Whether they be blond
or chocolate,

388
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:08,450
They're pele dogs. They're
all about pleasing you,

389
00:18:08,484 --> 00:18:10,318
All about making you happy.

390
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:12,621
You can neglect them,
you can ignore them,

391
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:15,023
You can walk all over them,

392
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:18,260
But still, making you happy
is their first thought.
Snipping the first band.

393
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:20,195
Now I would be fine
if you took up with

394
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:22,697
A golden retriever or a lab--
heck, even a schnauzer.

395
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:25,534
But sloan?
Sloan is a dachshund.

396
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:27,702
Dachshunds like to eat poop

397
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:30,605
Right up off the street--
other dogs' poop.

398
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,541
They're more concerned
with their own needs

399
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,176
Than they are
with making you happy.

400
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:38,213
They're filthy and immoral--
immoral?
They're immoral dogs?

401
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:40,448
The owners of dachshunds
are desperate--

402
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:42,050
Desperate for affection.

403
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:44,619
But it's the wrong kind
of affection,

404
00:18:44,654 --> 00:18:47,322
The kind that makes you
always take care of them.
Oh, my god.

405
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:49,524
What happened?
The a.V.M. Just blew.

406
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:51,793
She's bleeding all over.
I can't see a thing.

407
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:54,596
Convert to open.
With the baby
still inside her?

408
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,298
Yes. 10-blade.

409
00:18:56,332 --> 00:19:00,802
(monitor beeping erratically)

410
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:09,210
Was this my fault? I was
talking. W-we were talking.

411
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:11,412
I'm capable of talking
and operating simultaneously.

412
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:13,381
You blew the a.V.M.?!

413
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:15,250
Not on purpose.
(naomi)
I already told him that.

414
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:18,286
Well, then
what the hell happened?!
Stop yelling at her.

415
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,589
(naomi) don't yell.
She lost a lot of blood,
but she's gonna be okay.

416
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:23,925
And the baby?
I think he's gonna be fine.

417
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,694
You think?
I hope. I'm sorry. The a.V.M.
Is very delicate, mark.

418
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:28,530
It's directly below
the dissection,

419
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:31,833
And it--it--it--
it just blew.
I need to see her.

420
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:34,269
Okay, look, mark, she's gonna be
in bad shape when she wakes up.

421
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:36,404
She hemorrhaged.
I had to open her up.

422
00:19:36,438 --> 00:19:38,406
She's gonna be much worse
than last time.

423
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,742
The last thing she needs
is to look up

424
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:43,344
And see you hovering,
terrified.
What do you expect me to do?

425
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:46,347
Why don't we just take a walk?
We can just calm--
naomi, don't talk to me like
I'm a child. I'm not a 12 year--

426
00:19:46,382 --> 00:19:48,316
Mark, please,
just go with naomi.

427
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,052
She knows
what she's talking about.
Fix this.

428
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:58,159
That baby has to be okay.

429
00:19:58,193 --> 00:20:00,895
He will. He will.

430
00:20:02,197 --> 00:20:04,065
I care about mark sloan.

431
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:06,434
I loved him once.
And he was our best friend.

432
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:08,403
And, yes, he's done
a lot of stupid things,

433
00:20:08,437 --> 00:20:11,272
But he also let all of us
do a lot of stupid things.

434
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:13,608
He let us do
a lot of stupid things

435
00:20:13,642 --> 00:20:15,243
And he never judged us.

436
00:20:15,277 --> 00:20:17,679
He's not just a dog, sam.

437
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:22,216
Sure, he's got a screwed up
moral compass, but so do I.

438
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:24,285
He's a good man.

439
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,556
(exhales)
this baby's gotta be okay.

440
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:33,928
I didn't even know
he had a sister.

441
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:36,831
Yeah, and the fact that she
didn't even mention it...
Yeah.

442
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:39,334
It has to be the root
of the problem.

443
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:41,903
Hey, where's cody?
His mother took him home.

444
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:45,440
I'm calling d.C.F.S.
D.C.F.S. Is not
the answer--

445
00:20:45,474 --> 00:20:47,909
She snatched cody out of
the hospital

446
00:20:47,943 --> 00:20:50,411
And brought him back
to the house of horrors!
Why are you shouting at me?

447
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:52,780
Because you have no concern
at all for this boy.
The best thing for that child

448
00:20:52,815 --> 00:20:55,249
Would be to have a healthy
mother, and frankly,

449
00:20:55,284 --> 00:20:57,852
The best thing for you would be
to stop displacing your anger.
What is that
supposed to mean?

450
00:20:57,886 --> 00:20:59,721
You're angry at charlotte.
You're angry at yourself.

451
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:01,489
You keep lashing out
at everybody else

452
00:21:01,523 --> 00:21:03,458
So you don't have to take
responsibility.

453
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:05,693
I am trying to help cody.
By putting him
in foster care?

454
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:07,695
By ripping him
away from his mother?

455
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,731
By breaking his heart?
Get a grip, cooper.

456
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:15,236
Deal with your problems.
No, no, cooper. You gottathink
talk to her about that.O me?Em.

457
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,738
I'm serious. I am out.

458
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:18,172
Oh, you're out? You're out.

459
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:20,141
You don't get to be out!

460
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:23,044
How many times--how many times
have I had to listen to you

461
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:25,613
Go on and on and on
about allan

462
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:27,882
Or sheldon
or, oh, my god, pete?

463
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,151
Pete this and pete that,
violet.

464
00:21:30,185 --> 00:21:31,986
And look how well
that worked out.

465
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:35,723
Look how healthy I am.
Yay me. I am super normal.

466
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:37,859
Point taken.
Thank you.

467
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:40,728
Talk to her... Not me.

468
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:42,130
Work it out or not.

469
00:21:42,164 --> 00:21:45,233
You love each other,
you don't--figure it out...

470
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:47,835
With charlotte.

471
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,406
I'm calling d.C.F.S.

472
00:21:55,778 --> 00:21:59,847
Is there some reason why we are
eating in silence yet again?

473
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:01,816
May I be excused?

474
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,385
Maya, why don't you just
tell me what's going on?

475
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,021
We can talk out it.

476
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:10,425
Can I be excused, too?
Betsey, naomi went to
a lot of trouble--

477
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:13,361
Thank you for breakfast.
May I be excused?

478
00:22:13,395 --> 00:22:15,329
Sure, honey.

479
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:17,665
Yeah.

480
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:22,303
Well, at least you know why
yours isn't speaking to y.

481
00:22:22,337 --> 00:22:24,439
I didn't kill her mother,
you know?

482
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:26,040
I'm just gonna say it
to her, you know,

483
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:28,876
'cause at some point,
you gotta grow up.
Dell, she's--

484
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:30,912
I know she's 7. I-I know.

485
00:22:30,946 --> 00:22:32,980
But I-I can't
feel like this every day.

486
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:36,217
You know, I can't keep being
treated like the enemy.
Well, maybe all she needs
is an apology.

487
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:38,586
What am I apologizing for?
I did thright thing.

488
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,021
Heather's faced
was burned off.

489
00:22:40,055 --> 00:22:42,323
You know, she burned
her face off getting high.

490
00:22:42,357 --> 00:22:45,226
You really think I should've
let betsey into that room?
Okay, you're in mourning,

491
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,562
And, uh, you are my friend,
and you've been through hell,

492
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:49,464
So I've been
really gentle with you.

493
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:52,266
But I think I am not gonna be
gentle with you anymore.

494
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:54,235
I think I'm just gonna
tell you the truth

495
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:56,637
Because that's what I would
want you to do for me.

496
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:59,173
Are you okay with that,
if I'm not gentle anymore?

497
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,242
Yes.
Okay.

498
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:03,344
I think you should've
let her in that room.

499
00:23:03,378 --> 00:23:06,013
I think you should've let her
say good-bye to her mother.

500
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:08,883
I think pete was right, and I
think you owe him an apology.

501
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:11,853
And I think that betsey
has a right to be pissed.

502
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:13,421
I would be pissed, too.

503
00:23:13,455 --> 00:23:16,691
7 or 37, I would be pissed.

504
00:23:18,627 --> 00:23:20,061
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

505
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:21,329
Mo

506
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:23,831
Hey, sloan. It's addison.

507
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:26,067
Where am I?

508
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:28,970
You're in the hospital
in los angeles.

509
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:32,206
You just had surgery,
but everything is fine.

510
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:35,743
You and the baby are fine.
Where's my mom?
(cries) I want my mom.

511
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:38,146
Well, mark's here.
Your dad's here.

512
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:43,084
And he's gonna be here
in just a few minutes.
I don't want him.
I want my mommy.

513
00:23:43,118 --> 00:23:47,255
(crying) I don't want any
of this. I don't want a baby.

514
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:50,358
I just want to go home.
I want my life back.

515
00:23:50,392 --> 00:23:53,361
I want to go home.

516
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,111
I'm delirious.

517
00:24:00,145 --> 00:24:02,080
I am delirious
with exhaustion.
Mm.

518
00:24:02,114 --> 00:24:04,048
Lucas thought it was morning
at 2:00 a.M.

519
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,284
And then again at 3:00 a.M.
And at 4:00,

520
00:24:06,318 --> 00:24:08,252
And I'm--I feel like
I'm undeater.

521
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:10,188
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

522
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:12,090
You're a grown man,
and you're a wreck.

523
00:24:12,124 --> 00:24:15,026
That's what you were
talking about to who?
To myself...

524
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,328
(laughs)
in my head.

525
00:24:17,363 --> 00:24:19,864
Sloan sloan--she's...

526
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:21,799
She's pretty simple,
you know, and young.

527
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:24,202
And her mom had her
when she was young.

528
00:24:24,236 --> 00:24:27,305
And I don't think she's
even thought about adoption.

529
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:29,273
I don't think anybody's
counseled her.

530
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:31,075
And I think she feels trapped,

531
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,044
<i>And I think it's
my responsibility as her doctor</i>

532
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:36,314
To give her her options.
Well, of course it is.
What's the problem?

533
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:38,182
Mark. He really...
Wants this baby.

534
00:24:38,217 --> 00:24:40,118
He wants
to raise it with her.

535
00:24:40,152 --> 00:24:42,520
Are we talking about
the plastic surgeon?

536
00:24:42,554 --> 00:24:45,390
(laughs) oh, the contempt

537
00:24:45,424 --> 00:24:47,992
That seeps
from your every word--

538
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:51,362
Do you have that for
every plastic surgeon or just,

539
00:24:51,397 --> 00:24:54,332
You know, ones that I sleep with
on the floor of my office?
(laughs) I just--

540
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:56,200
I don't think there's
anything to debate, addison.

541
00:24:56,235 --> 00:24:58,202
You're her doctor,
she's a kid--
she's 18.

542
00:24:58,237 --> 00:25:00,204
Yeah, well, still,
it's your responsibility

543
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:02,940
To counsel her,
give her the options.

544
00:25:02,975 --> 00:25:05,176
Yeah.

545
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,079
Back in new york, you know,
mark and I were together,

546
00:25:08,113 --> 00:25:11,049
And, um...
I got pregnant.

547
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:14,152
And I told him about it,
and he was excited,

548
00:25:14,186 --> 00:25:17,622
And... I... Wasn't,

549
00:25:17,656 --> 00:25:19,157
And I had an abortion.

550
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:20,992
I didn't talk to him
about it first.

551
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:24,462
I made the decision
for both of us.

552
00:25:24,496 --> 00:25:25,963
And he wanted it.

553
00:25:25,998 --> 00:25:28,199
And he wants this one.

554
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:32,170
(sighs)

555
00:25:32,204 --> 00:25:35,173
One thing
can't inform the other.

556
00:25:35,207 --> 00:25:38,609
Your loyalty to your friend
and your--your guilt

557
00:25:38,644 --> 00:25:41,345
Or your rerse, it can't
inform your patient care.

558
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,282
You gotta give her the options
and let her choose.

559
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:46,684
Maybe it'll go his way.

560
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:48,653
And I'm sorry.

561
00:25:48,687 --> 00:25:51,355
It sounds just awful.

562
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,424
(sighs) thanks.

563
00:25:58,163 --> 00:26:00,898
Don't fall asleep on my head.
I'm up. I'm up.

564
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:03,234
(knock on door)

565
00:26:03,268 --> 00:26:05,136
How's the baby?

566
00:26:05,204 --> 00:26:07,071
Heartbeat's holding strong.

567
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:09,674
(sighs) I haven't
taken my eyes off it.

568
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,808
Good.

569
00:26:10,843 --> 00:26:12,910
That's, uh...

570
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:15,413
That's good.

571
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:17,615
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

572
00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:18,883
What?

573
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:21,819
This midlife crisis,
uh, you're having,

574
00:26:21,854 --> 00:26:23,821
All this talk about
moving to l.A.--

575
00:26:23,856 --> 00:26:26,524
Whatever is--is going on
with you,

576
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:28,459
Something worse is going on
with addison.

577
00:26:28,527 --> 00:26:32,163
And I'm not about to let her
be your landing pad.

578
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:34,732
What the hell
do you care, sam?

579
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:37,135
Well, she--she just spends
a lot of time, uh,

580
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:39,470
Trying to take care of
everyone at the practice,

581
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:41,939
So, you know, I'm trying
to take care of her.

582
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:43,875
I'm saying, I like you, mark,

583
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:46,644
But what you've been doing
around here,

584
00:26:46,678 --> 00:26:48,946
It's not you at your best.

585
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:52,049
And I ask again,
what the hell do you care?

586
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:54,218
I just care.

587
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:02,059
Hey.

588
00:27:02,094 --> 00:27:03,528
Looking for me?

589
00:27:03,562 --> 00:27:06,464
Yeah. I wanted to let you know
I have a staff meeting tonight.

590
00:27:06,498 --> 00:27:08,699
I'm not sure
when I'm gonna be home.

591
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:10,835
(exhales) you lied.

592
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:13,604
Why did you lie?
I just want to know why.

593
00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:17,441
I told you why.
No, y-you told me that there
are things you can't t--

594
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:21,546
I told you I didn't want
to go there.
Were you ever gonna marry me?
Was that a lie, too?

595
00:27:27,686 --> 00:27:31,122
Oh, can you answer the question?
The nerve to do this here.
Can you not ask it?
I have answered it?!      What?

596
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,631
You, uh,
you seen addison?

597
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:43,234
No, not recently.
Not down here.

598
00:27:43,268 --> 00:27:44,869
Oh.

599
00:27:46,238 --> 00:27:48,406
Your son?

600
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,407
Yeah.

601
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:51,475
And you bring him
to work?

602
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,579
Naom cool with that?

603
00:27:54,613 --> 00:27:57,815
I'm sorry. I, uh,
I'm about to have a kid.

604
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:00,818
Or my kid--my kid
is about to have a kid.

605
00:28:00,852 --> 00:28:02,720
And, uh, you can skip
the grandpa jokes,

606
00:28:02,754 --> 00:28:05,556
Because they have
all been made.

607
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:11,229
My kid, she's, uh...
Ashe's young.

608
00:28:11,263 --> 00:28:13,531
She's gonna need
a lot of help.

609
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:16,033
So I think it's really great

610
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:19,537
That you get to bring
your baby to work.

611
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:21,472
L.A.'s
a pretty liberal place.

612
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:23,474
Naomi's
a pretty liberal boss.

613
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:27,044
You know, I don't think
I've ever even held a baby.

614
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,846
I mean, obviously,
I held lots of kids

615
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,748
During my peds rotation
when I was a resident.

616
00:28:30,782 --> 00:28:32,416
But I don't--I don't...

617
00:28:32,451 --> 00:28:35,453
I don't think I've ever
even held a baby.

618
00:28:40,892 --> 00:28:43,761
Here.

619
00:28:43,795 --> 00:28:45,896
Go ahead.

620
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:47,298
Okay.

621
00:28:47,332 --> 00:28:50,368
Just be gentle.
I just got him quiet.

622
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,440
Hi.

623
00:28:56,475 --> 00:28:58,709
Ooh.

624
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:01,178
Hello.

625
00:29:01,213 --> 00:29:04,582
Wow, you're cute.

626
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:05,950
(sighs)

627
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:10,087
Shh. It's okay.

628
00:29:10,122 --> 00:29:12,990
(lucas coos)

629
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:15,760
So have I got this straight?

630
00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:17,728
You think my favorite hobby
is sitting around

631
00:29:17,763 --> 00:29:20,464
Dreaming up ways
to emasculate you?
You humiliated me

632
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:22,967
When you bought me into
the practice without asking me.

633
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:24,835
That made me less of a man.

634
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,837
You made yourself
less of a man

635
00:29:26,872 --> 00:29:29,206
When you spent all the money
in your bank account.

636
00:29:29,241 --> 00:29:31,609
You know what? Let's just...
Start over here.

637
00:29:31,643 --> 00:29:34,445
No, no, no, no. This is good.
Get it all out. This is good.

638
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:36,914
Charlotte king
finally opens up. Come on.
What's that supposed to mean?

639
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:39,116
I mean, I am there for you
and there for you,

640
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:41,319
But all you want to do
is screw and not talk and--

641
00:29:41,353 --> 00:29:43,487
<i>All I want to do is screw?
All I want to do?</i>

642
00:29:43,522 --> 00:29:46,123
Oh, you are gonna
have to look in the mirror,

643
00:29:46,158 --> 00:29:48,492
Because the pot is definitely
calling the kettle black.

644
00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:50,461
Screw is all you know
how to do.

645
00:29:50,495 --> 00:29:52,263
No, no, no. No, I'm a person.

646
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:54,965
I'm a whole person
with feelings and friends

647
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,469
And a practice full of patients,
and what do you have?
You.

648
00:29:58,503 --> 00:30:01,372
Don't you say that like
it's an insult. Don't you dare.

649
00:30:01,406 --> 00:30:04,375
I am not a freak.
I'm nothe freak, charlotte.

650
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:08,045
I'm not the freak that got fired
because I'm heartless.

651
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,647
Charlotte--

652
00:30:09,681 --> 00:30:12,783
No, you're the freak
who needed me to bail you out,

653
00:30:12,818 --> 00:30:14,885
Which is how I know
I'm not heartless.

654
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,822
The 50 grand I spent to buy your
ass a place in this practice

655
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,157
Proves I am not heartless.
And we're back
to the money again?

656
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:23,361
You are such a bitch
that you can't--
I do what needs to be done.

657
00:30:23,395 --> 00:30:26,230
I do whaneeds to be done,
and you resent me.

658
00:30:26,264 --> 00:30:28,332
Why, 'cause I don't go
all crybaby every five seconds?

659
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:30,401
It's not about crying.
It's not about crying.

660
00:30:30,435 --> 00:30:31,836
It's about being a person.

661
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,538
It's about being
a normal woman, for once.

662
00:30:34,573 --> 00:30:36,574
It's not my fault
you're not a man.

663
00:30:36,608 --> 00:30:38,976
So don't tell me
I'm not a woman.

664
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,545
(clatters)

665
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:46,484
I literally--I am full
of hatred right now.

666
00:30:46,518 --> 00:30:48,519
Oh, join the freakin' club.
W--

667
00:30:48,553 --> 00:30:51,455
Do you know how ridiculous it is
that you would take me aside--

668
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,525
Could you answer one questio
you can't separa--
I have answered it.

669
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,020
There's the heartbeat.

670
00:30:57,054 --> 00:31:00,390
And it's strong.

671
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:01,858
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

672
00:31:01,892 --> 00:31:05,061
So... I have to ask you this.

673
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,565
Has anyone ever talked to you
about adoption?

674
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:11,067
What, like when you pick
a family from the "pennysaver"?

675
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,936
No. That's just in "juno."

676
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,538
No, in real life,
there are agencies,

677
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,642
And all they do
is screen families.

678
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,543
They find you safe,
wonderful families

679
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,480
Who would love your baby
as much as you do.

680
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,316
There are agencies. In fact,
we have one at the practice.

681
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,852
Don't tell mark that we're
having this conversation,

682
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:31,288
'cause I know that
he'd freak out, and, like,

683
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,323
All my stuff
is still at his apartment.

684
00:31:33,357 --> 00:31:35,892
No, I'm--I'm your doctor,
so ian't tell yone

685
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:37,360
Anything
that we're talking about.

686
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,296
And--and for the record,

687
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,798
I think that you could be
a great mom, sloan,

688
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:43,767
And I know mark would be
an amazing--

689
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,269
So these agencies...

690
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:49,039
Like, what exactly do they do?

691
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,208
(matt nathanson's
"bulletproof weeks" playing)

692
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:55,945
We are breaking up.

693
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,081
Coop, we're having a fight.

694
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:01,685
No, we're done.

695
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,186
I'm done.

696
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,121
You don't get to be done.

697
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,991
You don't get to decide
what happens to us.
Good-bye, charlotte.

698
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:10,327
Okay, this...

699
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,529
This is the problem
right here.

700
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,231
You won't man up and face stuff.
You want to just cut and run.

701
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,901
We're having a fight.
No, thproblem is...

702
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:20,003
You are a sex toy
I found on the internet.

703
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:22,472
The problem is, you're just
a trashy little girl

704
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:24,474
Who's trying to please
her dead daddy,

705
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:27,944
And I shouldn't have
expected much from you.

706
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:30,046
My bad.

707
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:33,316
You act warm,
all cute, cuddly cooper.

708
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:36,219
But the bitch of it is,
you're the one who's heartless,

709
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:37,987
Not me.

710
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,724
You. You're a mean, cold,
miserable bastard

711
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:43,326
Who doesn't know a thing
about forgiveness.

712
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,528
You screwed another man,
I forgave you.

713
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,864
¶ what happened to... ¶

714
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:50,300
That's just sex.

715
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:52,435
I was talking about us.

716
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,306
I was talking about love.

717
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,441
You're supposed to love me.

718
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,909
¶ ...Was flat ¶

719
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,879
¶ what happened... ¶

720
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,915
Were you ever planning
on marrying me?

721
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,285
¶ to that? ¶

722
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,020
Doesn't matter now,
does it?

723
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:14,591
¶

724
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:21,264
They can't just come
and take my boy.

725
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:23,266
D.C.F.S. Does not want
to take cody.

726
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,668
They will,
but they don't want to.

727
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,104
But if you and I can show them
that you're fixing the problem,

728
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,207
Then they will do anything
they can to have cody stay here.

729
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,643
Mom, just throw
some stuff out.

730
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:36,513
Maybe cody can go to his room
so you and I can talk?

731
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:39,149
It'll be okay, mom.
Just listen to her, okay?

732
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,185
You can do it.
I know you can.

733
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:47,891
(door closes)

734
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,833
(cries) I can't.

735
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,968
This doesn't fill the hole.

736
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:01,704
This doesn't make up
for divorce and death.

737
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,840
You didn't tell me
about your daughter.

738
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:06,609
You didn't tell me because
what happened was unthinkable.

739
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:09,479
It's unbearable. But this
isn't working anymore, is it?

740
00:34:09,513 --> 00:34:11,948
It's not working
to keep away whatever it is

741
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:14,250
That's eating you
from the inside.

742
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,458
Did you divorce your husband
or the other way around?

743
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,293
How old was your daughter?

744
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,161
How did you find out
they'd been killed?

745
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,230
Did you have to identify
the bodies?

746
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:29,466
How did you tell cody that his
father and his sister were dead?

747
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:31,234
I divorced him, okay?

748
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:32,969
I didn't love him anymore.

749
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:35,472
He was a good husband
and a good father, but I...

750
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,407
I tossed him out
like a sack of garbage.

751
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:39,742
And if I hadn't done that,
then my daughter

752
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:43,413
Wouldn't have been in that car
in that place at that time.
You don't know that.

753
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:45,415
I do know that.

754
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,783
(sniffles)

755
00:34:46,817 --> 00:34:49,786
You want this gone?

756
00:34:58,195 --> 00:34:59,529
There.

757
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:01,731
(sobs)

758
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:03,433
How about that?

759
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,635
How about this?

760
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:08,071
(crying)

761
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:17,480
Maddy was 4 1/2.

762
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,550
She wanted to stay with cody
because he was sick,

763
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:23,486
But I made her go with her
father because I felt guilty

764
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,857
On the weekends.

765
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:31,160
And he loved them
more than anything!

766
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,428
(grunts)

767
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,464
He loved them,
and he loved me,

768
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:36,633
And I didn't want him!

769
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,268
(sobs)

770
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,137
No. No, they can't.

771
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:44,073
No, they can't take cody.

772
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,543
(crying) they can't take him.
They can't take him.

773
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,545
Hey, hey, hey.
Did you see what you did?

774
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,514
You threw stuff out.
Can you leave it out there?

775
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,150
Can you do that?
I think so.

776
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:57,754
I'm ellie farraday,
d.C.F.S.

777
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:01,925
Hi, ellie. We're just doing
a little housecleaning.

778
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,360
(elevator bell dings)

779
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:12,669

00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:18,875
(motor whirring)

782
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,843
I'm sorry.

783
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:25,014
For everything,
I'm sorry.

784
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:28,151
That's quite a punch
you've got.

785
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,021
(ding)

786
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,724
You coming?

787
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:37,260
Oh, no. I'm just riding
up and down.

788
00:36:37,294 --> 00:36:39,762
Lucas likes the motion.
(whispers) yeah.

789
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:43,967
You like the motion.
(makes kissing sounds)

790
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:50,073
I don't care what sam says.
This is ideal.

791
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,575
What did sam say?

792
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,844
Nothing.
Forget about s

793
00:36:54,878 --> 00:36:56,980
This is ideal.

794
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,548
Three parents--

795
00:36:58,582 --> 00:37:00,383
No one gets overwhelmed,

796
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:03,453
Everyone still gets
to have a life.
Mark--

797
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,689
This is our second chance.
Don't you see it?

798
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,858
What if there wasn't
a baby?

799
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:10,360
Why? What happened?

800
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,328
Nothing. Nothing happened.
The baby's fine.

801
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:15,465
It's just, what...

802
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:18,801
What if sloan changed her mind
or there wasn't a baby,

803
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:21,571
Would you still want
to move down here,

804
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:24,040
Join the practice,
be with me?

805
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:27,543
Because you keep asking,
and you paint a pretty picture.

806
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,446
And I'm just lonely enough
and I'm just scared enough

807
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:34,550
And I'm just freaked out enough
that if you ask me again...

808
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,853
I might say yes.

809
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:40,957
So I'm asking you
not to ask me again

810
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:42,659
If it's not about me.

811
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,495
If you're just heartbroken
or in love with someone else

812
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:48,398
Or you just want me
to help you with a baby

813
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,300
That you may or may not
be able to raise...

814
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,703
Don't ask me.

815
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:56,039
Because I don't know...
Anything.

816
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:59,375
I don't know...
Anything anymore,

817
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:03,046
Except, I can't fall in love
with a man

818
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,014
Who's in love
with someone else.

819
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,050
That much I know.
I can't do that again.

820
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,919
So please, if you're still
in love with the grey girl,

821
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:11,587
Then go back to seattle.

822
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:15,291
But if you're not...

823
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:19,862
I mean, if you're serious...

824
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,899
And you want me...

825
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:26,736
Then ask again.

826
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,706

I'm so sorry.

829
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,248
¶ uh-huh ¶

830
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,317
I'm sorry, red.

831
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:43,453
¶ I don't know where
I crossed the line ¶

832
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,388
Yeah.

833
00:38:45,422 --> 00:38:47,290
(sighs) me, too.

834
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:50,860
¶ ...Or didn't say this time? ¶

835
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:54,931
¶ and I don't know
if it's me or you ¶

836
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:58,501
¶ but I can see
the skies are changing ¶

837
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:02,105
¶ no longer shades of blue ¶

838
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,207
I was mad at her...

839
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,075
At your mom.

840
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:10,179
I was. I was so mad at her,
and I made a mistake.

841
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,415
I made a mistake.
I was scared...

842
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:15,685
And I was just trying
to protect you.

843
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,387
And I made a mistake,
not letting you see her.

844
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:21,557
¶ but that won't stop the rain ¶

845
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:24,160
I should've
let you say good-bye.

846
00:39:24,194 --> 00:39:26,763
I should've let her
say good-bye to you.

847
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,531
And I'm...

848
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:30,800
So sorry.

849
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:32,235
Grown-ups...

850
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,837
We're--we're supposed
to know what to do.

851
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,608
But when we get scared
sometimes, we don't.

852
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,977
And I'm sorry. I-I...

853
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,846
I'm sorry for not
letting you say good-bye.

854
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,315
Mm.

855
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,884
I'm just so sorry.

856
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,186
(voice breaks)
you should've let me.

857
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,022
I know. I know.

858
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:55,024
I know. Come here.
Come here.

859
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:56,759
Come here, come here.

860
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,661
I know. I know.

861
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:00,763
¶ please don't stop
the rain ¶

862
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:08,104
Sweetie, I know I'm not always
that easy to talk to.

863
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:08,437
My--my mother wasn't very easy
to talk to either.

864
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:11,007
But, um...

865
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,909
Whatever's going on
with you, maya,

866
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,711
I hope you feel that you can
talk to somebody.

867
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,047
Talk to dell or your dad
or...

868
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:20,850
Talk to someone, maya,

869
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:22,351
Because the hard stuff...

870
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:25,154
It always gets easier
once you let it out.

871
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,089
¶ andf it's going to be
a rainy day ¶

872
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,826
¶ there's nothing we can do
to make it change ¶

873
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,396
¶ we can pray
for sunny weather ¶

874
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,498
¶ but that won't stop the rain ¶

875
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:38,467
¶ you're feeling like
you've got no place to run ¶

876
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,703
¶ I can be your shelter
till it's done ¶

877
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:43,973
Addison...
Can I talk to you?

878
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:46,008
Sure. Come on over.

879
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,443
¶ please don't stop the rain ¶

880
00:40:47,477 --> 00:40:50,713
¶ let it fall, let it fall,
let it fall ¶

881
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:54,283
Hey. What's the matter?
Are you okay?

882
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,319
What's wrong?

883
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:57,954
What happened?

884
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,823
Sweetheart, whatever it is,
you can talk to me about it.

885
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,558
It's gonna be okay.

886
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,494
(voice breaks)
it's not gonna be okay.

887
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:09,031
¶ let it fall, let it fall,
let it fall ¶

888
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,666
¶ please don't stop ¶
