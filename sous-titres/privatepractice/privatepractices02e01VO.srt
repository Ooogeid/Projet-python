1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,000
Your family,
Whatever that means-

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,300
If you're single,
If you're married,

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,100
If-if you have kids
Or if you want kids-

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Your family should be
The most important thing.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,700
And your family is
The most important thing to us.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,400
What are you doing?

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm supporting
My eating disorder.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,800
What are you doing?

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,200
Oh, using handbags to fill
The sexual void.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,700
Emotional health is as important
As physical health.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,400
I create a safe place to talk.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,100
Well, i am avoiding
Sam's kisses.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,900
I'm avoiding dell's kisses.

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,900
I am avoiding being kissed.

15
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,800
I'm gonna donate my lips
To chocolate.

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,100
Yeah, well, the cop
Still hasn't called.

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,600
Two weeks, no call.

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,100
These lips? Dry.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,000
Virgin lips untouched by man.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
I am having sex

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,100
With bottega veneta.

22
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,400
I put my hands inside
A woman's body,

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,700
And i fix what's wrong.

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
But every woman's body
Is different.

25
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,600
Every woman's story
Is different.

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,100
We get our bonus checks
This week,

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,900
And i say we blow it all
On mnemba island.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,900
It-it's zanzibar, coop.
It's unsullied.

29
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's go sully it.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,800
Cooper?

31
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,000
Are you listening?

32
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm gonna have to
Call you back.

33
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,900
How do you know

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,400
You're doing what's best
To take care of your child?

35
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,300
Who's gonna help you
If the baby won't eat,

36
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,700
Isn't gaining enough weight,
Has a fever?

37
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,300
That's my job.

38
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,900
Come here to me... Now.

39
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,000
I use eastern medicine
To prevent illness.

40
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,900
I solve problems
Before they start.

41
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,200
So i wait outside addison's
House for, like, 2 hours.

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,300
She didn't show up.

43
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,200
I don't wait outside
Women's houses.

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,700
She should be waiting outside my house.
Does she even know you're interested?

45
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,500
She'll know. I'm on it.
She has you on a string.

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, you get anywhere
With naomi?

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,700
Hey, that-that's-
That's not the point.

48
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, i'm not on a string.
Pfft.

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,700
I'm in charge.
I'm-i'm in control.

50
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,500
I got this.

51
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,900
Yeah, how do you
Have this?

52
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,600
I don't know yet.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
A doctor's office
Should be a sanctuary.

54
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,100
The care you receive should
Be personal. It's good.

55
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,700
<i>that's what we do. We're a family...
Really good. Naomi did a good job.</i>

56
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,500
It looks like it cost way more
Than she said it would cost.

57
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Is this gonna affect our bonus checks? I need my
Bonus check. You're gonna get your bonus checks.

58
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,000
We sound professional,
But is it just me,

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Or is it a gap ad for medicine? Yeah, we're
Branded. We're a brand, like a perfume.

60
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,300
"my symptoms"-
A fragrance for men.

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,600
Dell, what'd you think?
You cut my line.

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
I wasn't even in it,
Not one single shot of me.

63
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,400
<i>your wife's...
Your husband's.</i>

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,700
<i>at oceanside wellness...
Our family</i>

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,900
<i>takes care of your family.</i>

66
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,300
I really need my bonus
Check, sam. Yeah, bonus check.

67
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
Yeah, sam,
Bonus checks.

68
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,800
Everybody's getting
Their bonus checks.

69
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,400
She's avoiding me.

70
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,200
I'll talk to her.

71
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,400
Nal,
The video looks good.

72
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Yeah, it's, uh, uh,
Gonna run on the internet,

73
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
In the lobby
On the monitors,

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,700
And i also lined up
A group of dentists

75
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,600
Who are gonna show it
In their offices.

76
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,700
It cost a lot of money, but you
Spend money to make money.

77
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,700
That's the goal
- make money. You okay?

78
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,900
Yeah, i'm fine.
Your files...

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,800
And these.
Thank you, dell.

80
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
If you have some time later, i
Think we should have a meeting.

81
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,200
I have, uh,

82
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Wall-to-wall patients today,
So...

83
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,500
Okay.

84
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,400
He try to kiss you again?
Did sam?

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,300
'Cause i'll punch 'em.
Verbally, i mean.

86
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,700
I can do verbal punching for
You. I would do that for you.

87
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,200
Nal, are you-what's wrong?

88
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,300
Nothing, i am fine.
I've got patients.

89
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,100
What happened
To the paper cups?

90
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
They're not justifiable
Environmentally.

91
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,300
Mugs-are they justifiable?
The dishwasher.

92
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,700
Hey, cooper. Guess who's
Been to the travel agent. Oh.

93
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,700
Look, zanzibar. Don't you
Feel drunk just looking at it?

94
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't know if i can go away
This year. We go away every year.

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,300
I have a patient.
We'll talk about it later.

96
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,900
Dr. King.
Dr. Freedman.

97
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,600
I assume you're here on
Important hospital business?

98
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,300
I am.
Well, let's... Talk.

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,300
Can i tell people
About us?

100
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,300
What?
I mean, just violet.

101
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,700
It's getting secret-y,
And i don't really do secret-y,

102
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,400
And my bonus check comes
This week.

103
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,800
You want to pay me
For the sex?

104
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,500
I thought we could use
The money

105
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,600
To go away together...
On vacation.

106
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,700
You and me on a... Vacation?
Yeah, like a normal couple.

107
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,600
I tell violet everything.
She's like my sister.

108
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
She's like my hot sister,

109
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,500
And we use our bonus checks
To go away every year.

110
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,200
But i think if i went away without you
- do not say it.

111
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,100
I might miss you.
Cooper.

112
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,900
Yes. Either get back on
Top of me and shut up,

113
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,500
Or keep talking and watch me
Walk out that door.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000

116
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,300
There is a lack of paper
Cups. Dell's going green.

117
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,100
So what are you doing with your
Bonus? Maybe buying paper cups.

118
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,400
Do you want to go out sometime? Out?

119
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,300
On a date.

120
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Well, that's...

121
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,800
Uh... Do you think
That's wise?

122
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,300
Uh, is there someone else?

123
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,400
Yes. No.

124
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,300
There was a person, uh,
An officer of the law,

125
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,600
But we never connected.

126
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,600
So, no, no, there's
- there's no one else. Okay, then.

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Think about it.

128
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,300
Hey, uh, molly madison is on her way in.
She was just here a couple of days ago.

129
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,600
I- oh, nervous mommies.

130
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,000
I do not have time
For nervous mommies.

131
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,700
Hey, addie. Can you see
A patient for me?

132
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
She's in room, uh...

133
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,200
Four.
Yeah, i have time.

134
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Thanks.
Thank you.

135
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,500
What's her story?

136
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,700
She's just got the jitters.
It'll be ten minutes tops.

137
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,300
So, uh, pete asked me out.
Do i go? No, i mean, do i go,

138
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,000
With the dry, untouched lips and
All? I'm making human life here.

139
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,800
Patient.
I will see her now.

140
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,800
Thank you.

141
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,100
Hi.

142
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,500
You... Asked me out,
And then you blew me off. Hi.

143
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,100
I didn't blow you off.

144
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
I had training
For the s.w.a.t. Team.

145
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
I'm s.w.a.t. Now.

146
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,700
You show that to all the
Girls? No, just the cute ones.

147
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,500
Mm. But i'm here now. I'm available.

148
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,500
I have a patient.

149
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,000
And you are just a stranger,

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,400
Some guy i met, you know,
And i don't get blown off.

151
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,600
I am not the kind of woman
You blow off.

152
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,100
You have your pride.
I have my pride, yes.

153
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,700
Go away.
Go s.w.a.t. Something.

154
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,300
Molly, eric.
Hi, i'm dr. Montgomery.

155
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,500
Where's dr. Bennett?
She has another patient.

156
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,100
We need to see dr. Bennett.

157
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,200
Well, why don't we just see

158
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,500
If i can find out
What the problem is first?

159
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,400
Let's see-
27 weeks pregnant,

160
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,900
Ultrasound from two days ago
Looks good,

161
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,900
Oh, it's a girl,

162
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,800
And... Placenta positioning
Looks good.

163
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,000
So what's the concern?

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,600
I- i need to have this baby.
Well, everything's on track.

165
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,400
No, that-
That's not what-eric.

166
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,200
We need to have this baby
Now. Today if possible.

167
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,800
I'm-i'm sorry.
I'm not understanding.

168
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,300
You're only
Six months pregnant.

169
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, you have to induce
Or do a c-section

170
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,200
<i>so that i can
Have this baby today.</i>

171
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,400
It has to be born.
Please just-

172
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,700
He'll die if you don't.
He-he is dying, damn it.

173
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,600
I'm sorry, who is dying?

174
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,100
Our son jason. He's 7.

175
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,200
He has
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

176
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,400
The baby's cord blood's the only
Thing that can save him.

177

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,800
You're avoiding me.

179
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,700
I am not avoiding you.
I've just been busy-

180
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,100
Running the practice
And raising our daughter.

181
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,900
Always keeping the trains
Running on time.

182
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,400
Trains or no trains,
We will talk.

183
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,200
Hey, do you have a minute?
No, act-

184
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,400
No, she does not.

185
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,800
What?
Molly and eric madison.

186
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,500
You selected the embryo that
Matched their dying son...

187
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,300
And implanted it.
Selective i.v.f.

188
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,000
You chose a genetic match
For their dying son

189
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,400
And impregnated her?

190
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,800
Yes. I-i do not understand
What the problem is here?

191
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,500
The problem is that
She's carrying a child,

192
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,200
Except to her it's not a child,
It's an organ donor.

193
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,500
To her, she's growing organs
For her sick son.

194
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,900
Not organs.
The umbilical cord blood

195
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,000
Is going to be collected
At birth, processed,

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,700
And then infused into her son to save his
Life. Same thing, nal. Morally, ethically-

197
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,700
It's a gray area to grow
A child's genetic match.

198
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,300
This is done all the time
As a backup.

199
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,100
But he is dying now,
And she wants her daughter

200
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,700
Delivered
Three months premature

201
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,300
With no regard
For the baby's health.

202
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, god. I didn't...

203
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,000
They-they had
A partial match donor.

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,400
The partial match
Has pneumonia.

205
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,200
Addison...

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,800
That means...

207
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,400
Their son has had
His immune system stripped

208
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,700
In preparation for the donor.

209
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,100
He's in the hospital right now,
And if he doesn't receive

210
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,900
That cord blood
Within the week, he dies.

211
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,100
Well, what did you tell 'em about
Delivering the baby? I said no.

212
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,900
Why?

213
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Thank you for the update,
Dr. King.

214
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,500
You're welcome,
Dr. Freedman.

215
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,400
Hey. I was just coming-

216
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,000
So on mnemba island,
There's no phones,

217
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,300
There's no computer,
There's no television.

218
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
Our bonus checks will be put
To very good use.

219
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,600
Um, i don't know. Maybe.

220
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,400
We can touch monkeys, cooper.
We can touch monkeys.

221
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,600
Yeah, okay. You made that
Last part up. I have patients.

222
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,000
Well, i have patients, too,
And as i am seeing them,

223
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,300
Part of me will be conjuring
Images of touchable monkeys.

224
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,600
Dean.

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,900
Hey, dr. Freedman.

226
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,400
How you been?
Good.

227
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How about you? How you
Been? It was a good month.

228
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,800
That's what i like to hear.

229
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,400
Dell, the new patient
Gowns blow. They keep ripping.

230
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,200
Yeah, we're working out the kinks with some
New vendors. What's wrong with the old vendors?

231
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,500
And where are the-
Dishwasher.

232
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Yeah,
Everything looks good.

233
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,900
Everything at school good?

234
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,600
Good. I have a girlfriend.
Amy. She's amazing.

235
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,200
Well, good.
You taking it slow?

236
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,400
We haven't done it... Yet,
But she's going on the pill,

237
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,700
So we will soon.
Believe me when i say

238
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,300
I will not be
The first of my friends.

239
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,200
Oh, i know, but, um,
Condoms, okay?

240
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,800
Hey, s.t.d.s don't care
About the pill.

241
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,500
Condoms are your friend-
Lots of condoms.

242
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,200
Or better yet, you know,
Wait.

243
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
If this is the girl, you ought
To enjoy the time before,

244
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,500
Because once you're on
The other side,

245
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,400
<i>you can't go back.
Hello.</i>

246
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,500
You just heard "blah, blah,
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah"?

247
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,000
Dr. Freedman,
I'm gonna have sex,

248
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,600
And i really like her.

249
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,100
It's not all skanky.
It's right.

250
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
I, like, love her
And everything.

251
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,400
Well... Now i go back
To my condom speech.

252
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
So i am your friendly

253
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,200
Neighborhood
Condom pusher man.

254
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,800
Condoms.

255
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,300
If you can save their son by
Delivering the baby, i don't-

256
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,600
6- month preemies are at risk
For brain bleeds, blindness,

257
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,900
Hearing loss, not to mention
Respiratory distress.

258
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,200
And no one would advocate
Bringing a child

259
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,800
Into the world before
She's ready, and you know it.

260
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,900
Did you even consider the fact
That this little girl

261
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Is arriving into a family
Unwanted?

262
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,500
What happens when she discovers
That the only reason

263
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
She was conceived was to save her
Brother's life? We are talking about

264
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,800
Saving this family from
Suffering the death of a child.

265
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,600
You gave them hope they shouldn't have. I
- i'm trying to save a child's life.

266
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
You discuss this stuff
With us.

267
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
When any of us come into
An ethical gray area,

268
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,300
We all discuss it.

269
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,900
We decide as a practice
What to do.

270
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,400
I meant to, all right?
I... I just forgot.

271
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,300
Since when do you
Forget anything?

272
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
If i could get one guy

273
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,600
To do a colonoscopy
With no complaint...

274
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,100
I mean, like i'm happy about
Going all up in there.

275
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,400
What are you looking for?

276
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
I'm trying
To leave you a note,

277
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,200
But i can't find a pen that works.
Well, what's-what's the note?

278
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
How i can't find a pen
That works.

279
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,900
Dell has decided to go green-
Tissue paper gowns,

280
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,200
No cups, no pens.

281
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm all about saving the planet, but he's
Killing me. You want me to talk to dell?

282
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,300
We both know
Who dell listens to.

283
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Is this naomi's idea?

284
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,500
I have no clue
What naomi's ideas are.

285
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,100
My woman's giving me trouble.
Your woman's giving you trouble.

286
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,100
These women, cooper.

287
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,100
What?

288
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,300
14-year-old kid, i've been
Treating him since he was 5.

289
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,800
Now he's found this girl-
He likes her,

290
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
They're gonna have sex.
That's hardly a shocker.

291
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,700
Wait, don't tell me you're getting
All nostalgic. It's dean miller.

292
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,200
Oh, man. Why does that
Name sound familiar?

293
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Because we debated whether
We should take him on

294
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,200
As a patient.
He's the kid who-

295
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,200
He's h.i.v. Positive, but that wasn't the debate.
The problem is, he doesn't know he's h.i.v. Positive.

296
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,200
His parents won't tell him,

297
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,700
And he doesn't know
He could kill that girl.

298
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,700
He thinks
He has a kidney condition,

299
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
And he's doing quite well.
I mean, the majority

300
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,800
Of his symptoms are from the antiviral
Cocktail. How do you keep something like that

301
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,600
From your kid for 14 years? It
Was before the prognosis changed.

302
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,700
They didn't think
He was gonna be alive

303
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,800
Long enough to understand. So
That explains the first six years.

304
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,600
I'm not allowed to tell him
About the h.i.v.

305
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,800
I'm not allowed
To tell the parents

306
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,000
Anything that dean tells me.

307
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,800
Doctor-patient confidentiality
All around. So you can't

308
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,500
Let 'em know about the girlfriend.
No, or that they're gonna do it.

309
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,000
This is a good kid.
He would not endanger this girl

310
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,100
If he knew, and he doesn't.

311
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,800
His hormones are full roar,
Right? He likes the girl.

312
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,500
He wants the girl. He's gotta have
The girl. We've all been there.

313
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes, we have.

314
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,500
Anyway...

315
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,300
You know what?

316
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,800
I gotta try to get
His parents back in my office.

317
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,100
He loves bugs.

318
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,900
And he sneaks ladybugs
Into the house in his pocket.

319
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,900
He likes meatballs...
And french fries.

320
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,900
And he's still
Afraid of the dark,

321
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,700
But he thinks
He's too old to admit it,

322
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,600
So i have to pretend

323
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,800
To forget to turn off
The light at bedtime.

324
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,600
And he likes to read. And all
He wants for his 8th birthday

325
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,400
Is to never go
To a hospital again.

326
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,800
He-he's a wonderful boy.

327
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,700
I can see that,
But, mrs. Madison, i can't.

328
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,600
In good conscience, i can't
Deliver your baby early

329
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,300
Because i'm sure
She's wonderful, too.

330
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,600
We are good people and-and we
Didn't go into this lightly-

331
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,400
Having this baby-
And we will love her.

332
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,700
We will. It's just,
We don't know her yet.

333
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,800
And... I-i know jason.

334
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,600
I've held jason.
I- i've smelled his skin.

335
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,200
I- i know jason.

336
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,400
I'm so sorry.

337
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,400
I- i've checked you out.
You're a specialist.

338
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,200
If-if anyone can deliver
A premature baby safely,

339
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,000
It's you.

340
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,800
I wish i could help,
But there's nothing i can do.

341
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,500
How can you
Look at my 7-year-old son

342
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,500
And know he's going to be dead
In a week and do nothing? Please.

343
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,900
Addison-

344
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,700
Don't talk to me.
Addi-

345
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,500
Don't say anything, please. Just don't.
Addison, i was not trying to manipulate you.

346
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,900
I just thought if you saw him,
Maybe you would realize

347
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,900
That you can help them.
I can't help them!

348
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,000
You gave them hope
They shouldn't have,

349
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,900
And now i am the bad guy.
Addison.

350
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,700
I told you
Not to say anything to me.

351
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,100
Hey, i really do need to
Talk to you. Not now, dell.

352
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,700
Are you okay?
What's going on?

353
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,900
Has there been bloodshed?

354
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,400
Because naomi is in the kitchen
Just inhaling the candy supply.

355
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,600
Come on. It was low to begin with.
Well, dell refuses to buy any new candy.

356
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,800
Wait, he's withholding candy?
He told me to "make due"

357
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,700
With the sweet tarts from last halloween?
Well, nobody can handle the old sweet tarts.

358
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,800
We need chocolate. No, i told-i
Told dell that he had to get-

359
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,000
<i>this has nothing to do
With candy.</i>

360
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,200
I can't do anything.
I can't save that child.

361
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
I can't deliver the baby.

362
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,000
To the best
Of my medical expertise...

363
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,600
I cannot do... Anything.

364
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,100
Don't beat yourself up.

365
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,300
It's not your mess. It's naomi's.
Wait, you mean the madisons?

366
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,500
Because naomi did
What she thought was right.

367
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,700
You do what you need to do
To save your family.

368
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,300
She had no way of knowing
The donor would back out,

369
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,500
And now it's too late. But we always
Discuss these things as a group.

370
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,000
Naomi went ahead and did this
Without talking to anybody.

371
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,100
So maybe
She's off her game.

372
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,400
She's seeing a record number of patients a day
- she's been really on edge lately.

373
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,600
Yeah, it's not like her.
Well, guys, i mean,

374
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,800
She does everything.

375
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,900
We just...
Eat the candy.

376
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,100
She's hiding something.

377
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,900
Has anybody even asked her
What's wrong?

378
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,100
Where are you going?

379
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,400
This i can
Do something about.

380
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,000
Who'd win in a fistfight,
Naomi or addison?

381
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,500
Not in the mood
For a lecture.

382
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh, i'm not gonna lecture you.
I'm just gonna block the exits

383
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,300
Until you decide to tell me what's going on with
You. Well, we're gonna be here a very long time.

384
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,100
I can wait.

385
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,700
What, they're not
Even saying anything?

386
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,400
They're just standing
There. A test of wills.

387
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,600
A battle of champions.
Uh-huh.

388
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,300
You guys are so mature. Oh,
Yeah? You mentioned a fistfight.

389
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,400
That's true.

390
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,600
Cooper.

391
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Dean's parents are here...

392
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Thanks.

393
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,700
And everyone else.

394
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,400
There's a lobby
Full of patients...

395
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,000
In case anyone is interested
In working here

396
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Or running this place.

397
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,000
There's a girl dean likes,
But sex is a long way off.

398
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,800
I've had pregnant
13 year olds

399
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,000
Whose parents
Have said the same thing.

400
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,400
Dean needs to know
His h.i.v. Status

401
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,200
Before he starts experimenting.
And he will.

402
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
What i'm saying is,
You can't afford to wait.

403
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,500
You have any idea what it's
Like for h.i.v. Kids?

404
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,000
A kid in chicago got shot.

405
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,500
Another kid, they tied him to a car
Bumper. That's before people were educated.

406
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,300
Nobody needs to know but dean. He's not
Old enough to deal with this, not yet.

407
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,300
You want them to be children
As long as it lasts.

408
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,800
Things are so sweet,
They can still be anything.

409
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,700
As soon as that's over-

410
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,800
I wish it could be longer,
But it can't.

411
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,200
You say people are educated?
They'll understand?

412
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,300
If it was your kid,
You wouldn't be so sure.

413
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,400
Could you honestly live with yourselves
- do you not hear me?

414
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,000
If he gets another kid sick,
What happens when he finds out

415
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,100
That you didn't
- we will do what's best for him, and don't you overstep here.

416
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,200
You're not leaving me
Much choice.

417
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,000
Say one word to dean,
And i-i'll take your license.

418
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I will sue you
For everything you've got.

419
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,500
Nal... Come on.
You can tell me anything.

420
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,100
It's not like you to get
The madisons pregnant

421
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,900
Without discussing it
With the rest of us.

422
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,600
Now i know you must have
Had a good reason.

423
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,700
You have a good heart.
Just talk to me.

424
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,600
They paid the practice
$80,000.

425
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,700
<i>and i don't have
A good heart.</i>

426
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,700
They had cash,
And we needed the money,

427
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,000
And so i took it

428
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,100
Even though
I did have reservations,

429
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,500
Because naomi always keeps
The trains running on time.

430
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,900
What, uh, what do you-
What do you mean? What-

431
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,900
I keep the trains running
On time. That's what i do.

432
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,200
I run things.
I mind the details.

433
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,600
Only this time, it...
Just got away from me.

434
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
What got away from you?

435
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,200
You can't tell anybody.

436
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,600
You cannot tell the others. You have
To promise. What, um, okay, i promise.

437
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,900
What, are you-you're talking
About the practice?

438
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
We own the building.

439
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,400
And-and i saw a chance
To refinance the mortgage,

440
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,200
And i thought...

441
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,800
Now the balloon payment
Is due,

442
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,300
And no one is billing enough,
And there isn't enough.

443
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,000
There is never enough.

444
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,200
And so i used the last of
The money to make the video.

445
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,300
Naomi-
We are broke, addison.

446
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,100
If things keep going
The way they have been,

447
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,700
The practice is finished...
Soon.

448
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
All right, screw them.

449
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,583
We let them come after me.
They really think

450
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:16,998
A jury's gonna back them
When they're perfectly happy

451
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:20,333
To let their son infect some nice girl from the
'Burbs? The law says they have the right to do this

452
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:23,854
How they want to do this. I'm taking
My chances. I'm gonna tell dean.

453
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,156
If they sue,
They sue the practice.

454
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:27,897
Why don't you think about
Someone other than yourself?

455
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:31,989
Whoa, naomi. Coop's just trying to do the right
Thing, here. He's talking about getting us sued.

456
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,723
There are
Responsibilities here.

457
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:35,723
So you think that family
Has the right

458
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,689
To hide important information
From each other?

459
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:41,523
Sometimes people hide things for good reason.
Hiding things is no way to protect them.

460
00:20:41,524 --> 00:20:43,958
<i>it is when you're the
One in charge. Whoa. Whoa.</i>

461
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:45,828
Everybody breathe. Cooper's
Gonna figure out a way.

462
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,395
He always does.

463
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:57,029
Mm.

464
00:20:57,063 --> 00:20:58,729
Hey.

465
00:20:58,763 --> 00:21:00,262
Is it wise?
Huh?

466
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:02,963
Our date.
Oh.

467
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:05,488
Um, i haven't had time-

468
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:07,175
Can we talk
About this tomorrow?

469
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:15,947
So you, uh, you ready
To talk yet?

470
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:18,532
No, i am not ready
To talk...

471
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:19,948
About anything.

472
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,635
Good night, guys.
Okay.

473
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:22,997
Wait, hey-
Good night.

474
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:26,052
These women.

475
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:27,753
Shots.

476
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:28,497
Yeah.

477
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:35,486
Cooper always
Figures out a way?

478
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:37,068
Cooper does not always
Figure out a way.

479
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:40,439
You know what's gonna make you
Feel better? Mnemba. Mnemba.

480
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:41,965
Monkey touching.

481
00:21:42,455 --> 00:21:44,589
<i>i got the pamphlets right here. Violet.</i>

482
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:45,737
There's pretty girls
In the pamphlets,

483
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:48,234
And they might do dirty,
Trashy things to you

484
00:21:48,438 --> 00:21:49,269
When i'm in the spa.

485
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,746
Is that what this is about?

486
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:56,116
A girl? Is there...

487
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,240
Cooper do you have a woman
That i don't know about,

488
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:01,734
A non-cyber woman?
There's no woman.

489
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:03,486
Then what is it?
It's bonus time.

490
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:05,251
We always blow half of it
On sunburns

491
00:22:05,252 --> 00:22:07,483
And hazy memories, coop.

492
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:08,991
Violet, don't count on me
This year.

493
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,545
Want to play
Naughty little schoolboy?

494
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,075
Mistress and butler?

495
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:26,247
I could be the warden,
You could be my prisoner.

496
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:27,746
How about...

497
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,354
Boyfriend and girlfriend?

498
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:31,583
Damn it, cooper.

499
00:22:33,557 --> 00:22:35,229
You really know
How to dry a girl up.

500
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,981
Okay, first of all,
It was a suggestion.

501
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:39,197
And second of all,
I lied today.

502
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,997
I told violet a lie. I told her
I wasn't seeing anybody.

503
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,240
Would you rather
Lie to violet

504
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:44,760
And play naughty schoolboy
With me,

505
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:46,727
Or tell her the truth
And play with yourself?

506
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,233
Why do we
Have to keep it a secret?

507
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,266
'Cause y'all are one big
Incestuous family,

508
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:53,267
And i'm not joining
The family.

509
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:55,879
This isn't that serious.

510
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,550
I'm sick
Of keeping secrets,

511
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:08,991
And i'm really sick of keeping
Secrets from my best friend.

512
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:12,184
So... Maybe you should
Just go.

513
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:19,885
I'm wearing
Crotchless panties, coop.

514
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:24,488
No, no. No.
I am not your toy.

515
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:26,241
There's a lot of other things
I could be doing,

516
00:23:26,242 --> 00:23:27,087
You know, better things.

517
00:23:27,088 --> 00:23:30,394
I could be traling. I could be
Touching monkeys in mnemba. Mnemba?

518
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:33,650
Zanzibar.
And you could be with me

519
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:35,739
If you weren't
Pathologically allergic

520
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,063
To human relationships.

521
00:23:48,183 --> 00:23:49,724
Crotchless panties.

522
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,239
Hey.

523
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,584
Did naomi say anything
To you?

524
00:24:08,617 --> 00:24:10,727
What...
What do you mean?

525
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:12,737
In the kitchen, did she
Tell you what was wrong?

526
00:24:12,738 --> 00:24:16,272
Oh, no. I-i think she's
Just tired. I think it's me.

527
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,541
I've been pressuring her
To talk about us.

528
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:21,474
I just wanted a second chance,

529
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:24,474
And i don't think
She wants to give it to me.

530
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,078
I think this is her way
Of telling me that...

531
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,050
It's over between us.

532
00:24:31,051 --> 00:24:33,184
No, sam. I'm sure
That's not what it is.

533
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:34,484
Then what is it?

534
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:36,848
It's like i said.
She's just... Tired.

535
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:39,287
All right.

536
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:09,633
Yeah, yeah,
That's fine. All right.

537
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:13,395
Addison...

538
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,479
He has no idea
What is going on with you.

539
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,747
If you-
No. No.

540
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:23,294
This is dr. Montgomery.
This is dr. Bennett.

541
00:25:25,977 --> 00:25:28,610
We'll be right there. I'll
Drive. I'll call charlotte king

542
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:30,241
To get you surgical privileges
At the hospital.

543
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:33,270
Dell, cancel my patients
For the rest of the day.

544
00:25:33,271 --> 00:25:35,072
You said
This was an emergency.

545
00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:36,983
I thought that meant there was
Something in his labs.

546
00:25:36,984 --> 00:25:38,950
No, he's fine.

547
00:25:38,984 --> 00:25:41,736
Dean... Your mom and dad,

548
00:25:41,737 --> 00:25:43,783
They still think of you
As being a kid.

549
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,071
Well, i am...
Mostly a kid.

550
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:49,733
Yeah, but you're not a kid.
That's not what i see.

551
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:50,797
That's not what i hear
From you.

552
00:25:54,444 --> 00:25:56,631
I think everybody needs
To know the truth here.

553
00:25:56,632 --> 00:25:59,711
We're fine with how things
Are. Then i have no choice.

554
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:03,598
I have to reveal something that, legally, i'm not
Allowed to. I thought we were clear about this.

555
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:05,998
Come on, honey. We're
Going. Dean, your parents-

556
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,065
Stop!
This is not your place.

557
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:09,985
This is my child,
This is my little boy,

558
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,026
And i will do what's right.

559
00:26:11,478 --> 00:26:13,454
Dean's planning on having sex
With his girlfriend.

560
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:18,989
Mom.

561
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:20,986
No...

562
00:26:21,766 --> 00:26:24,200
I trusted you.
Why would you do this?

563
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:26,989
Why is this such a huge deal?
It's not the end of the world.

564
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,145
What's going on?

565
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:34,664
Dr. Freedman,
Could you step out?

566
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:35,490
Yeah.

567
00:26:40,963 --> 00:26:42,218
What happened?

568
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:43,819
She's not dilated
Or effaced,

569
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,491
But her water broke
An hour ago.

570
00:26:45,492 --> 00:26:46,482
Plus, she's bleeding,

571
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:48,244
And the baby's showing signs
Of distress.

572
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:50,374
I've gotta get
That baby out now.

573
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,342
Naomi, if you collect
The cord blood,

574
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:53,750
I have a team standing by
Ready to transplant.

575
00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:54,254
Jason's prepped and waiting.
Yeah.

576
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,429
What did you do?
Her water just broke.

577
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:02,681
I am the best chance
Your baby has of survival,

578
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:05,149
But i will walk out
Of this hospital right now

579
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,693
And leave you, your baby
And your son's lives

580
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:09,922
To some nervous o.b. Resident
If you lie to me again.

581
00:27:09,993 --> 00:27:13,194
<i>i am sick of lies.
What did you do?</i>

582
00:27:15,394 --> 00:27:18,394
I broke my water myself...

583
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:21,394
With a knitting needle.

584
00:27:27,988 --> 00:27:29,420
I need an o.r.

585
00:27:29,454 --> 00:27:30,927
Call anesthesia,
Make sure we can get a spinal,

586
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:33,884
And notify nicu ???

587
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:53,395
Is the baby okay?

588
00:27:53,428 --> 00:27:55,795
Taking out the placenta...

589
00:27:55,828 --> 00:27:58,027
And the umbilical cord.

590
00:27:58,061 --> 00:27:59,862
Who's closing?
Over here.

591
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:01,227
Get in here.

592
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:11,271
Is the baby okay?

593
00:28:12,228 --> 00:28:15,399
Apgar's 4. 3-0 e.t. Tube and a
Straight blade. Wait! Is the baby okay?

594
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,983
No. No, she is not okay.
Please. I'm sorry.

595
00:28:18,294 --> 00:28:21,094
Please just save her.
Please.

596
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:22,361
I am doing everything i can.

597
00:28:24,428 --> 00:28:26,239
Molly,
Eric and i are leaving.

598
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,239
Jason should have his father
With him just in case. Okay.

599
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,240
I'm sorry.

600
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,639
Okay, maybe we should-

601
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,822
Stop! Enough!

602
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:50,702
What am i gonna tell people?

603
00:28:51,294 --> 00:28:54,397
"sorry, i forgot i have a.i.d.s."?
You don't have a.i.d.s. Okay, h.i.v.-

604
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:58,124
H.i.v.-
You take care of yourself,

605
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,798
You're gonna live
A long, healthy life.

606
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:01,992
You knew,
And all this time,

607
00:29:01,993 --> 00:29:03,094
You didn't tell me.

608
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,469
I thought you were my friend.

609
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,503
I couldn't tell you
The truth before.

610
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,993
And now i will tell you
Everything you need to know,

611
00:29:09,994 --> 00:29:13,021
And i swear...
I'll do everything i can

612
00:29:13,022 --> 00:29:16,491
To help you have the life you
Want. But you can't. It's too late.

613
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:18,231
We had sex last night.

614
00:29:19,956 --> 00:29:21,494
It's too late.

615
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,765
Cord blood's on its way
To jason and...

616
00:29:29,182 --> 00:29:29,918
Oh, damn.

617
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:32,233
I'll see if i can get
The parents up here

618
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:33,635
To say good-bye
Before she goes.

619
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:35,468
Wait. We're gonna try
Liquid ventilation on her.

620
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:38,740
That's highly experimental.

621
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:40,917
Yes. Have you ever done it before?

622
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:42,671
No, but i'm about
To do it now.

623
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,207
The fluid expands her lugs
So they don't collapse.

624
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,449
We're simulating the womb.
Keep an eye on her sats.

625
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,776
If they go up,
We know it's working.

626
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:06,233
Montgomery, sats are falling.
Give me a second.

627
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:09,678
Come on, come on.

628
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:12,363
Come on.

629
00:30:21,682 --> 00:30:22,653
There we go.

630
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:25,239
Montgomery, where the hell
Have you been hiding

631
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,233
All my medical life?

632
00:30:26,234 --> 00:30:29,501
Aww, i like you, too,
Charlotte.

633
00:30:45,534 --> 00:30:48,334
Hi. I came by to check on
The madisons.

634
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,767
How are they doing? Mom's
In recovery from her "c."

635
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,434
Jason's receiving
His cord blood infusion.

636
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:53,999
Montgomery's keeping
The baby alive

637
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,333
Through sheer force of will.
It's a mess.

638
00:30:58,129 --> 00:30:59,230
You ever miss
The good old days,

639
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:02,534
When life and death was decided
By god instead of doctors?

640
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:04,464
Well, we'd be out of jobs.

641
00:31:04,498 --> 00:31:05,741
But, man,
It would be good, though,

642
00:31:05,742 --> 00:31:10,511
To just not be in control,
To just let go, let god.

643
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:13,989
I could travel.
I could go to africa.

644
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,679
I could... Touch monkeys...

645
00:31:16,423 --> 00:31:18,056
Or whatever.

646
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:38,059
How's jason?

647
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:41,205
We'll see.

648
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:43,981
How's the baby?

649
00:31:44,014 --> 00:31:46,281
We'll see.

650
00:31:49,014 --> 00:31:49,650
Thank you.

651
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:50,671
Yeah.

652
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:55,991
Thank you.

653
00:31:55,992 --> 00:31:56,516
Okay.

654
00:31:57,858 --> 00:31:59,468
Yeah.

655
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,310
You did the right thing.

656
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:14,480
I know.

657
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:18,739
You did what you could.

658
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:20,007
I know.

659
00:32:24,806 --> 00:32:25,894
But that doesn't make it
Any better.

660
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:29,779
Nope.

661
00:32:35,715 --> 00:32:36,617
I have to talk to you.

662
00:32:37,182 --> 00:32:38,979
Dell, i don't have time
For your stuff right now.

663
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,451
It's gonna have to wait. You know, i-i've
Been covering for you the best that i can-

664
00:32:42,452 --> 00:32:45,139
The bills, the late notices,
The vendor calls.

665
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,009
And while
You're working overtime

666
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,351
To stop the hemorrhaging,
I've been trying to catch

667
00:32:48,352 --> 00:32:49,980
The things you forget
And the stuff you don't see.

668
00:32:50,472 --> 00:32:51,275
Okay, i've been
Keeping your secrets

669
00:32:51,276 --> 00:32:52,443
And i have been hiding
Your mistakes,

670
00:32:52,444 --> 00:32:54,522
And i just wanted to say
Something so i could help you.

671
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,074
I- i thought that you-
I know what you thought.

672
00:32:58,488 --> 00:33:01,475
You thought i... You thought
I wanted to talk about us.

673
00:33:02,226 --> 00:33:05,100
But i get it.
There is no us.

674
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,598
So, um...
Daily patient schedules,

675
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,076
Phone sheets, vendor lists
And my keys to the offices.

676
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:16,115
Dell, what...
I quit.

677
00:33:48,311 --> 00:33:50,944
Naomi's running the practice
Into the ground.

678
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,241
I wasn't thinking.

679
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:07,937
Something has to be done,
And i can't be the one to do it.

680
00:34:07,938 --> 00:34:09,635
I'm new here.
I haven't earned the right.

681
00:34:09,971 --> 00:34:11,668
And she's my best friend.

682
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:12,676
Well, i'm her husband.

683
00:34:13,771 --> 00:34:14,760
Was.

684
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:17,496
I was her husband.
Now i'm not anything so-

685
00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:19,485
Sam,
Something has to be done,

686
00:34:19,837 --> 00:34:21,296
And you have to be
The one to do it.

687
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,609
Yeah.

688
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:30,697
You're here late.

689
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:33,527
I'm catching up
On patient notes.

690
00:34:33,904 --> 00:34:35,303
Me, too.

691
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:41,589
Want to know the truth?

692
00:34:42,238 --> 00:34:43,487
I'm trying to remember
What i did

693
00:34:43,488 --> 00:34:44,737
Before cooper got a life?

694
00:34:45,488 --> 00:34:46,825
It's ridiculous.

695
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:50,907
He used to need me,
And now i need him.

696
00:34:52,063 --> 00:34:53,941
I'm trying to figure out
What it is about addison

697
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:55,771
That makes me act like
A 14-year-old boy.

698
00:34:56,508 --> 00:34:57,074
It's humiliating.

699
00:34:58,475 --> 00:35:00,720
I gotta start
Sleeping around again.

700
00:35:01,074 --> 00:35:03,058
Do you want to come
To zanzibar with me?

701
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:06,308
Pretty girls in zanzibar.

702
00:35:06,341 --> 00:35:07,742
I've been.

703
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:10,141
You can touch monkeys there,
You know.

704
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,074
I knew it.

705
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:20,729
You can't tell anyone
About us.

706
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,490
But i will consider a vacation-
Somewhere close,

707
00:35:23,491 --> 00:35:25,463
Somewhere i can
Flee from easily,

708
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,658
Like napa or palm springs.

709
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:32,238
I'm here.

710
00:35:32,658 --> 00:35:34,985
I came crawlin' back, okay?

711
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:37,855
I'm crawlin'.
In crotchless panties?

712
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,107
In no panties.

713
00:35:54,908 --> 00:35:55,753
You know where i live?

714
00:35:56,185 --> 00:35:58,407
I'm a cop. I-i know
Where everyone lives.

715
00:35:58,918 --> 00:36:01,319
Funny. Um...

716
00:36:01,352 --> 00:36:03,585
Listen, i have had...

717
00:36:03,618 --> 00:36:04,982
The worst day, so-

718
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:06,227
Well, we could go out.

719
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,749
We could go out and have fun
In a casual way

720
00:36:09,783 --> 00:36:11,783
That is, uh, fun and casual.

721
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:13,983
I know i'm some guy
You barely know,

722
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:16,629
Some total stranger who's not
In your world but i-

723
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,978
No, no, the "not
In my world" part is good.

724
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:22,735
So?

725
00:36:27,857 --> 00:36:29,371
Show me the s.w.a.t. Thing
Again.

726
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,793
I just...

727
00:36:51,324 --> 00:36:52,192
I just want...

728
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,311
Can we just be us again?

729
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:00,793
I just need something
To work.

730
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:37,907
Dede!
Le)

731
00:37:46,175 --> 00:37:48,808
Is is my girlfriend amy.

732
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,374
What you said yesterday
About answerswg questions...

733
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:53,340
We have a lot.

734
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:55,230
Well, why don't you all
Come into my office?

735
00:38:06,768 --> 00:38:07,546
Thank you.

736
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:10,388
Dr. Montgomery.

737
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:14,491
I did what i had to
To save my family.

738
00:38:15,187 --> 00:38:16,873
You would do the same thing
In my situation.

739
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:36,115
I heard you kicked liquid ventilation
Ass yesterday.

740
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:37,607
Oh, i did okay.

741
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,531
So?

742
00:38:40,564 --> 00:38:42,230
Pete, i can't.

743
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:46,030
Things around here
Are about to...

744
00:38:46,064 --> 00:38:49,064
And i am seeing someone
As-as of last night, so-

745
00:38:49,097 --> 00:38:50,476
I got it.

746
00:38:50,477 --> 00:38:52,085
I'm sorry, pete. I...

747
00:38:54,296 --> 00:38:54,857
Not wise.

748
00:39:04,495 --> 00:39:07,228
Hey.
Are you ready for this?

749
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:08,475
She came over last night.

750
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:11,193
She came over last night,
And we...

751
00:39:12,962 --> 00:39:15,368
I'm supposed to do this now?

752
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:16,834
What's the alternative?

753
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:19,176
You do what you have to do.

754
00:39:19,822 --> 00:39:21,540
You do what you have to do
To save your family.

755
00:39:24,523 --> 00:39:26,356
Okay?

756
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:34,808
Okay.

757
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:36,358
Here we go.

758
00:39:40,722 --> 00:39:44,016
Hey. Uh, i need to see you
In the conference room.

759
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:44,987
I can't.

760
00:39:44,988 --> 00:39:45,497
Now.

761
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:48,434
It won't take long.

762
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:54,727
Oh, thank you.

763
00:39:57,972 --> 00:39:58,745
Bonus time.

764
00:39:58,746 --> 00:39:59,513
Amen.

765
00:40:02,285 --> 00:40:04,097
So, um... Mnemba?

766
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:07,233
I think i'm just gonna go
On my own.

767
00:40:07,234 --> 00:40:09,048
You know,
Do the single girl thing.

768
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:09,891
Yeah?

769
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:12,016
Okay.

770
00:40:22,242 --> 00:40:25,094
Okay, so, uh...
It's that time of the year.

771
00:40:27,346 --> 00:40:27,679
Bonuses.

772
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:34,729
That's very funny, sam.

773
00:40:35,618 --> 00:40:36,139
What's the deal?
Is this-

774
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,639
This money came, uh, from
My personal checking account.

775
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,334
It's $100 apiece.
Uh, it's all i had to give.

776
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:46,207
If... If you want more,
Uh, earn it.

777
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:51,041
The practice is broke.

778
00:40:51,302 --> 00:40:54,287
We don't bill enough,
We don't see enough patients

779
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:57,936
And we always expect naomi
To do everything.

780
00:40:57,969 --> 00:41:00,969
So... We're broke, people.

781
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:01,999
You told him?

782
00:41:08,702 --> 00:41:10,702
You knew?
Addison-

783
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:12,702
Wait, hold up.
Naomi, what happened?

784
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:16,502
Wait. Don't look at naomi. You look at
Me. Sam, i don't think this is the way to-

785
00:41:16,535 --> 00:41:19,569
If there are any questions as to
How the place is going to run,

786
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,335
From now on, you look at me.

787
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:22,501
As of this moment,

788
00:41:22,502 --> 00:41:25,016
Naomi is relieved
Of her administrative duties,

789
00:41:25,017 --> 00:41:28,049
And i am taking charge
Of the practice.

790
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:39,351
Sam
- okay, i actually don't think this is legal.

791
00:41:59,128 --> 00:42:06,010
We've all been here a lot longer than addison...
I actually think that if you looked at the bylaws...

792
