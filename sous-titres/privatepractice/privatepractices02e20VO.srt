1
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:08,285
Hospital rounds?

2
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:11,350
House call.

3
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:13,725
Since when do you make house calls?

4
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:18,236
Who are you going to see?

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,460
A patient.

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,337
Who's home on bed rest.

7
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:26,249
Come on. It's... Nai, it's easier for me
to go see Morgan Gellman at home

8
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:28,784
than it is for her to come in here.
The less that she moves,

9
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:31,530
the better chance she has
of keeping the baby.

10
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:34,060
There is nothing going on

11
00:00:34,552 --> 00:00:38,202
with me and the husband, okay?
This is a professional visit...

12
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:41,081
For serious medical reasons.

13
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:44,664
As long as it's a professional visit
for serious medical reasons.

14
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,922
I'm responsible for saving
that baby's life, Nai.

15
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,342
I'm a lifesaver.

16
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:49,670
I'm a doctor.

17
00:00:54,218 --> 00:00:57,010
She seems okay now.
She paged me on my way in...

18
00:00:57,148 --> 00:00:59,142
said she'd already called you.

19
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:02,093
I'm glad

20
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:03,251
that...

21
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:05,033
that... she called.

22
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:07,192
We're trying to be careful.

23
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:10,190
This is a beautiful home.

24
00:01:10,827 --> 00:01:11,673
Thanks.

25
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:14,131
Morgan decorated it herself.

26
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:17,160
Her taste is...

27
00:01:18,017 --> 00:01:19,011
exquisite.

28
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:26,930
- So we should go on up, and see Morgan.
- She would be up... Is it...

29
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:32,711
Height... A thrilling 5 feet even.
Weight...

30
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:35,571
a perfectly appropriate 84 pounds.

31
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:38,521
And overall health,
as the kids would say,

32
00:01:38,648 --> 00:01:39,490
ab fab.

33
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:43,221
The kids don't say that.

34
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:45,063
Really? They don't?

35
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:46,952
They should.

36
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:54,552
It's Gretchen. She just got
her braces off. Can I take it?

37
00:01:57,347 --> 00:01:58,242
Twelve.

38
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:02,002
Wasn't it, like, a year ago she was
carrying around that stuffed unicorn

39
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:05,203
she made everybody pet? Now she's got
pierced ears and a cell phone.

40
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:08,181
Given what passes
for kids' TV, the internet...

41
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:09,602
What can you do?

42
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:11,830
Speaking of which,

43
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:15,011
I think Sarah needs to see
a female doctor.

44
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:19,082
Are you uncomfortable with me
examining Sarah, or is she?

45
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:20,433
It's not that. It's...

46
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:23,413
I need someone to prescribe her
birth control.

47
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:31,510
<i>Private Practice S02E20
Do the right thing</i>

48
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,782
Please just tell me it isn't
happening again.

49
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:36,632
If I lose another baby,
I swear to God...

50
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:38,431
Don't jump there,
you always jump there.

51
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,500
That is because I have lost
every baby I've ever carried.

52
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,011
- I'm sorry.
- You're scared,

53
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:45,442
but there's no reason to be.
Right?

54
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:48,211
Her cervix is open.
The amniotic sac is protruding.

55
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:50,442
- Can you stop it?
- With cervical cerclage, yeah.

56
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:53,240
Can you just stop talking doctor
to each other and just talk to me?

57
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:56,460
I'm gonna sew your cervix shut
to keep the baby in.

58
00:02:57,137 --> 00:03:00,412
I want her to be transported by
ambulance. I'll ride along to monitor.

59
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:02,581
I'll call ahead.
I'll meet you there.

60
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:03,903
It'll be fine.

61
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:09,983
I should be scared now, right?

62
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:18,962
Is Sam running late?

63
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:24,280
One of the great things about practicing
law, Nai, is that court starts late.

64
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:25,273
And...

65
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:26,570
you get to dress up.

66
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,903
You look good.

67
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:30,681
Damned by faint praise.

68
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:33,721
Handsome. Handsome. Winning.

69
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:36,602
- A little better.
- All right, let's do this.

70
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,940
Now that's what I like to see
in my expert witness, man,

71
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:40,390
a little fire in the belly.

72
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:44,260
But probably not bits of red delicious
in the teeth. Let me see.

73
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:45,872
You're good...

74
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:47,871
- You ready to save a man's life?
- Yes, sir.

75
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:49,002
Good luck.

76
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:52,621
All right, Big Ben.
How you feelin' this week?

77
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:56,721
Subpar. The second I walk outside,
I start wheezing like a goat.

78
00:03:57,368 --> 00:03:59,562
You taking that milk thistle
before every meal?

79
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:01,611
Choking that down
helps for a little,

80
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:03,842
but I feel like my allergies
are getting worse.

81
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:06,123
Pretty Soon, you're gonna have
to put me in a bubble.

82
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:08,251
We'll make sure it's a cool bubble.
Hop up there.

83
00:04:08,377 --> 00:04:09,672
I hate this part.

84
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:11,513
How are the ladies treating you?

85
00:04:11,638 --> 00:04:14,071
Same as last week
and the week before that.

86
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:15,483
Hard to find a keeper.

87
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,900
It doesn't get any easier at my age.

88
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:21,453
My mom hasn't dated anyone since
she and my dad got divorced.

89
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,443
Sometimes people need a little time

90
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:24,723
- to...
- She's ready.

91
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:26,452
She just doesn't meet guys who are,

92
00:04:26,587 --> 00:04:27,931
you know, smart and funny...

93
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:29,440
Cool, like you.

94
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:32,713
Hi, sorry. I just wanted to see
how things were going in here.

95
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:34,541
Come in, mom.
Meet Dr. Pete.

96
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,683
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you. I'm sorry.

97
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:40,571
His dad usually takes him, so I wasn't
sure if I should stay in or out.

98
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:42,611
You can stay in, right, Dr. Pete?

99
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,020
As long as you don't mind me
sticking needles in his face.

100
00:04:45,155 --> 00:04:48,382
I don't know. How long are we gonna
have to keep them in?

101
00:04:48,518 --> 00:04:50,850
See? She's funny, right?
And pretty.

102
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:54,120
She does pilates, like, every day,
makes awesome meat loaf...

103
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:56,300
- Goof nut. Thank you.
- No, it's okay.

104
00:04:56,427 --> 00:04:57,773
I like meat loaf.

105
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,780
I don't like how Sheldon
was looking at me.

106
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,252
He had on that critical face.
Like, " oh...

107
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:07,293
- you're gonna eat all that? "
- Don't mind him.

108
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:09,242
I do mind him.
I mind everyone,

109
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:11,853
everyone who thinks that I choose
to eat like a walrus,

110
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:14,590
- much less look like one.
- What're you gonna do? Babies need to be fed.

111
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:17,202
It's only temporary.
Breast-feeding alone

112
00:05:17,335 --> 00:05:21,073
- will burn a million calories.
- Though you're not breast-feeding yet.

113
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:25,381
Thought you were over Pete.

114
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:28,451
I am. I am, entirely.

115
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:32,493
You know what time it is?

116
00:05:33,595 --> 00:05:34,473
10:42.

117
00:05:35,537 --> 00:05:38,180
Around here, we normally consider 9:00
to be the beginning of the workday.

118
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:41,002
- Did I miss anything?
- That's not the point.

119
00:05:43,737 --> 00:05:44,582
Listen,

120
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:47,441
I know that you're having a hard time
with Betsey gone,

121
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:50,091
so I'm not gonna make an issue of this.
But the next time you're late,

122
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,073
- can you just please call?
- Sure.

123
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:55,440
Can you give me some help?
Addison's gone,

124
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:58,563
and I have a 12 year old
who wants birth control.

125
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:03,573
We need this baby.

126
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:06,863
Not that I think a baby can
or should save a marriage.

127
00:06:07,238 --> 00:06:10,570
I'm not stupid. But right now,
this baby is holding us together.

128
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:12,292
Before I got pregnant,

129
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,100
Noah and I were gonna try
things apart.

130
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,333
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:21,661
The second baby, I...

132
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:23,820
I lost it at seven months.

133
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:27,343
We've been through hell together.

134
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:30,893
Hell is holding a dead baby
in your arms.

135
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:32,952
Our marriage...

136
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:35,463
There were cracks, you know?
And then they got bigger.

137
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:36,790
They got huge.

138
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:39,030
Whatever happened between us,

139
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:40,651
this baby...

140
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,463
You have to save it,

141
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:45,232
'cause this baby's
our second chance.

142
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:49,840
Naomi's great.
Don't worry.

143
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:54,360
The whole, you know, "kids grow up
so fast " thing, I obviously...

144
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:55,892
I get that. And...

145
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:58,651
I assume you're
being clear with Sarah that

146
00:06:58,771 --> 00:06:59,934
it's too early for sex.

147
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:02,282
Dr. Freedman,
she's already having it.

148
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:03,761
She has a boyfriend,

149
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:05,213
another eighth grader.

150
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:07,421
They both have hormones raging,
and frankly,

151
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:09,750
I don't trust him to use a condom.

152
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:13,160
- I'm trying to be proactive.
- But you're condoning this.

153
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:15,402
This is gonna happen
whether I like it or not.

154
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:18,601
I'm just trying to keep as much of it
as I can on my terms.

155
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,683
The kids are only allowed to have
sex in my house when I'm there.

156
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,812
Wait... I'm... I'm sorry.
What?

157
00:07:23,936 --> 00:07:25,941
Would it be better if I force them
to sneak around,

158
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:28,733
scrambling for privacy God knows
where with no supervision?

159
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,771
Wouldn't it be better
if you just told them no?

160
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:32,282
And enforce it how?

161
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:35,222
It's just me,
and I work 50 hours a week.

162
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,703
I can only try to

163
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:38,620
steer her in the right direction,

164
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,200
help her avoid getting hurt.

165
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,601
She's 12 years old and
she's having sexual intercourse.

166
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,001
- She's already being hurt.
- All due respect,

167
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:46,631
you are out of line.

168
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:49,862
- What's wrong?
- We're leaving.

169
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:50,990
Thank you.

170
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:56,482
What'd you say to her?

171
00:08:00,036 --> 00:08:03,102
So you believe Dr. Allen's diagnosis
and treatment were appropriate

172
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:05,451
- under the circumstances?
- More than appropriate.

173
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:06,781
Extraordinary.

174
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:09,810
Martin Weiser came into the E.R.

175
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:13,323
with crushing chest pains,
hypoxic, barely responsive.

176
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:16,330
When the patient progressed to full
cardiopulmonary arrest,

177
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,833
Dr. Allen did C.P.R.

178
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:21,011
And defibrillation,
exactly as indicated...

179
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:23,323
exactly as any doctor would do.

180
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:25,432
So in your expert opinion,
Dr. Bennett,

181
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:26,952
were there mistakes made here?

182
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:29,002
Even when we do everything right,

183
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:30,882
and I believe Dr. Allen did,

184
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:32,763
there're some patients
we just can't save.

185
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,970
Now that's not malpractice.
That's...

186
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:36,590
That's just life.

187
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:38,120
Thank you, Doctor.

188
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:45,483
I'm sorry....

189
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:49,982
Dr. Bennett, I am Corinne Lee.
I'm counsel for mr. Weiser's widow

190
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:51,202
and his son.

191
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:56,013
"Every person is unique.
A good doctor needs to know them,

192
00:08:56,137 --> 00:08:58,702
to evaluate them individually,
not by the book.

193
00:08:58,825 --> 00:08:59,991
The book can be wrong."

194
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:02,412
Excuse me, but is there a question
somewhere here?

195
00:09:02,535 --> 00:09:05,240
Are you familiar with that quote,
Dr. Bennett?

196
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:07,021
That is a quote from my book.

197
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:08,172
But doesn't it

198
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:09,610
contradict

199
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,312
what you were just saying
about mr. Weiser's care?

200
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:15,523
You quoted textbook cases
and standard protocols.

201
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:18,211
But you weren't there.
You didn't actually see him.

202
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:19,383
Isn't that correct?

203
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:22,402
I stand behind everything I said
about Dr. Allen's care.

204
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:24,581
So you didn't mean what you wrote?

205
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:25,650
I did....

206
00:09:25,787 --> 00:09:28,503
I spent a lot of time researching
and writing...

207
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:32,032
Does that leave you much time
for seeing actual patients?

208
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:34,641
I have a very active
medical practice.

209
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:38,021
Oceanside Wellness Group.

210
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:40,720
There was a measles outbreak there.

211
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:43,653
- Did you follow the book on that one?
- Objection. Argumentative.

212
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:46,830
Dr. Bennett is holding himself up
as an expert.

213
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:48,973
I'm entitled to question him
on that claim.

214
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:50,102
Overruled.

215
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:53,843
The measles outbreak.
A child died.

216
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:56,112
- Again, argumentative.
- Withdrawn

217
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:58,091
Was the noted cyclist Ray Daniels

218
00:09:58,215 --> 00:09:59,973
- a patient under your care?
- Yes, he was.

219
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:02,453
He had a serious heart muscle disorder,
but you let him compete

220
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:05,920
in a 100-mile bike race,
and he died as well, didn't he?

221
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:07,223
I told him not to race.

222
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:09,871
But you treated him for a sports injury
so that he could race.

223
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:12,172
- See, Ray... was pigheaded.
- Pigheaded?

224
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:14,362
Do you always talk about
your patients like that?

225
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:16,122
- Or only the dead ones?
- Wait...

226
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:18,431
This family...
lost a husband,

227
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:19,671
a father.

228
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:22,721
He walked in the door and did not get
the treatment that he needed.

229
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:25,953
Now it may be okay with you
that patients just die.

230
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:28,442
It's not okay with them.

231
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,443
Let's talk about your nickname...

232
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:36,922
"Dr. Feelgood."

233
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,942
I just spent time with a happy,
healthy girl that she has raised.

234
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:50,853
Yvonne is obviously
doing something right.

235
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:53,071
She's doing a lot of things right.
I don't think that excuses

236
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,873
letting her daughter have sex
in the room next to hers.

237
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:58,023
Could you back me up here?

238
00:10:58,098 --> 00:10:59,313
It's not that simple.

239
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:02,761
Adolescent sexuality is not something
you can just say no to.

240
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:05,343
You have to address the nuances
of a particular situation.

241
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:08,590
So a mother who acknowledges
her daughter's desires

242
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:11,991
- and tries to channel them safely is...
- Probably doing the right thing.

243
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:13,923
What are you doing?

244
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:16,813
Hello, hopscotchers.

245
00:11:17,295 --> 00:11:20,673
The mother is allowing her 12-year-old
daughter to have sex in her house.

246
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:23,093
If you're not there, it's...
really hard to know what's right

247
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:24,362
for her and her daughter.

248
00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:26,162
Right, 'cause why would
a man get a say?

249
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:28,153
The mother knows best.
That's how the world works.

250
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:30,580
See? Okay, like with Dell, right?

251
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:32,290
Mother does not always know best.

252
00:11:32,348 --> 00:11:34,151
- But it's apples and oranges.
- It is not.

253
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,110
And how can you, as the
mother of a little girl, how...

254
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:39,372
can you not have a problem
with what yvonne is doing here?

255
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:42,220
With Maya, this... zero chance
of happening 'cause I would kill her.

256
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:45,481
But I am talking about Yvonne's right
as a parent to decide

257
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,781
what is best for her child.

258
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:48,733
Fine, but motherhood
is not a trump card.

259
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:51,983
- Wrong is wrong.
- Parents get to decide that, Cooper.

260
00:11:52,165 --> 00:11:54,663
- Not doctors.
- I just hope that when Betsey's 12,

261
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,970
there's someone like Cooper there
to say that it's not okay

262
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:59,671
to be sleeping around,
no matter what the mother thinks.

263
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:12,273
I got Brody from anesthesia
to come in for Morgan.

264
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,240
I booked the O.R. for 4:00.

265
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,262
What about the 26 weeks?
Is that okay?

266
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,112
It's late. I'm not gonna lie to you.
But...

267
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:22,991
it's the best choice.

268
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:27,750
She loves you, you know?

269
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:30,691
- I know.
- She needs you.

270
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:32,120
I know.

271
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:39,041
Right pell, I'll see you tomorrow.
He'll be fine. Thanks for coming in.

272
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:40,823
- It was really nice to meet you.
- Thank you so much

273
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:42,893
- See you tomorrow
- Really. Okay. Bye.

274
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,743
How can you even think about
sleeping with a patient's mother?

275
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:51,052
- What?
- That flirty smile,

276
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:54,461
- leading to unnecessary but...
- Come on.

277
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:56,573
- Gentle physical contact.
- You know what, Violet?

278
00:12:56,698 --> 00:12:58,062
You have no right to comment

279
00:12:58,185 --> 00:13:00,272
- on my love life. You don't.
- It's an ethical issue.

280
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:03,573
- I'm treating her son, not her.
- You are taking advantage of a young,

281
00:13:03,697 --> 00:13:05,150
vulnerable mother
who can't help

282
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:07,231
but respond to someone
in a position of authority.

283
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,972
You think that's the only reason
she might be interested in me?

284
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,541
- Ethically speaking...
- Wrong

285
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:22,311
- person to talk to right now.
- Problem?

286
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,332
Never mind.
What's your question?

287
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:30,503
Dating a patient's mother...
that's not a problem, right?

288
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:32,412
Violet thinks it's a problem.

289
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:33,970
I don't know, Pete.

290
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,592
I'm about to operate
on Noah's wife.

291
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,691
And I like her.

292
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:43,880
I really like her.

293
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:46,131
And their marriage is on the rocks,
and the only thing

294
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,682
holding it together is this baby,
and I'm supposed to save it.

295
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:49,991
You'll save the baby.

296
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:51,802
That's what you do.

297
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:55,620
Of course I'm gonna save the baby.
That's not the issue. It's...

298
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,382
I don't know.

299
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:00,062
Addison, their marriage...

300
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:02,673
- It's... not in your hands.
- What if it is?

301
00:14:03,345 --> 00:14:05,293
Then it's already gone south.

302
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,633
I'm not a cheater, Pete.

303
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:10,411
I'm not.

304
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:15,593
Maybe that one time I did, but not now.
I'm... it's not who I am.

305
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:17,162
I am not a cheater.

306
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:19,910
I know.

307
00:14:20,187 --> 00:14:22,132
Then why do I feel like I am?

308
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,071
What happened?

309
00:14:31,356 --> 00:14:33,392
He just lost it on the stand, Nai.

310
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:36,170
The other side came after him...
The practice, his credibility...

311
00:14:36,238 --> 00:14:37,430
And he just...

312
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:39,790
He just let her shred him up there.

313
00:14:40,136 --> 00:14:41,170
It was that bad?

314
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,730
I know that I was the one that talked
him into doing this, but I just...

315
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:46,090
thought...

316
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:49,280
He's Sam. All that experience
in front of the camera...

317
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:50,521
He's a doctor.

318
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,272
He's not a spokes person.

319
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:54,703
If there's any chance of turning
this around, I need to put Sam

320
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:58,271
back up there on that stand.
But only if he can do it.

321
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,211
- What happened?
- Shortness of breath with

322
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:07,750
pleuritic chest pain. Sats are dropping
D-dimer's positive probably threw a P.E.

323
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:09,553
Is the...
The baby okay?

324
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:14,712
There's no signs
of fetal distress, Morgan.

325
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:19,202
- V-fib. She's coding.
- Get the crash cart, stat!

326
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,210
Let's go.

327
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:22,701
- Give me the bag. Give me the bag.
- Get the cart over here.

328
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,650
- Get ready to charge.
- I'll do it. I'm gonna do it.

329
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:28,922
No, look. She's my wife.
I'll do it.

330
00:15:29,098 --> 00:15:30,510
Charge to 200.

331
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:33,801
- Charged.
- Okay. Clear.

332
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:37,402
Charge to 300.

333
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:39,922
All right. Clear.

334
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:45,232
I got a pulse.
Okay, pressure's coming up.

335
00:15:46,516 --> 00:15:48,650
Baby's heartbeat is normal.
Start her on lidocaine.

336
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:50,732
Call I.C.U. and tell 'em
we need a room, now

337
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:54,021
Bolus 75 milligrams, then start
a 2-milligrams- per-minute drip.

338
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,080
- She almost died.
- But she didn't. She didn't.

339
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,112
There's no way you could've
known about the P.E.

340
00:16:00,246 --> 00:16:02,350
- I'm a heart surgeon. I should've.
- There's no way...

341
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:04,383
I live with her.
I wasn't paying any attention.

342
00:16:04,508 --> 00:16:05,861
This isn't your fault.

343
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:07,481
It is. It is my fault.

344
00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:09,472
I don't see her anymore.
I don't

345
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:11,722
- look at her... I don't think about her
- But...

346
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:14,813
not like I should. I mean,
I care about the baby, but I don't...

347
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:17,241
- I don't think about her.
- But you just saved her life,

348
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,590
Would you stop trying
to make me feel better?!

349
00:16:20,227 --> 00:16:23,891
I don't think about her.
All I think about is you.

350
00:16:25,386 --> 00:16:28,632
All I think about is you,
and she could've died.

351
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,400
She could've died.

352
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:47,980
Feeling better?

353
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:52,042
I looked like
an idiot in there, Nai.

354
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:55,011
I'm a good doctor.
I'm a great doctor.

355
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:57,322
Yes, you are a great doctor.

356
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,453
- You are not a professional witness.
- That's no excuse.

357
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:03,453
Sam, I have seen you

358
00:17:03,937 --> 00:17:06,370
convince an entire
auditorium of people

359
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:08,131
to do what you wrote in your book.

360
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:09,721
Now I know that you can convince

361
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:12,693
12 people that you're not
a blithering idiot.

362
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:15,901
He wants to put you back
on the stand.

363
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:18,281
- Really?
- Yeah.

364
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:25,420
That means I gotta go back over
all the medicine from that case

365
00:17:25,555 --> 00:17:28,440
and memorize it.
That way, no matter what I'm asked

366
00:17:28,576 --> 00:17:31,803
I'll be able to bring it back
to what happened, what matters.

367
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:33,923
I will not be thrown.

368
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:47,560
<i>Sarak luv this pics of you
Bo thinks u r so hot naked.</i>

369
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:52,100
I can't help it. All I want to do
is eat and sleep and bark.

370
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:54,510
I barked at Pete this morning.
But, you know, he deserved it.

371
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:56,652
He wants to date a patient's mother.

372
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:57,953
What?

373
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,923
A message from some kid about the naked
pictures of my 12-year-old patient

374
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,833
that are now apparently floating around.
You still think mother knows best?

375
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:08,430
- Who are you calling?
- I'm calling D.C.F.S.

376
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:10,580
About sarah? No, Cooper.
You cannot do that.

377
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:13,752
- Somebody needs to protect this girl.
- You cannot call family services.

378
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:15,512
I just got her blood work back.

379
00:18:15,957 --> 00:18:17,211
Sarah's pregnant.

380
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:27,793
Maybe you should've dropped me
as a patient. I seem to be trouble.

381
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:30,703
You're doing fine now.

382
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:33,083
Noah told me.

383
00:18:33,898 --> 00:18:35,312
He was, here...

384
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,282
Till I woke up.

385
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:41,031
Did you talk to him?

386
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:42,802
What?

387
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:44,551
He wouldn't look at me.

388
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:47,823
I mean, he was here with me,
but he wasn't with me.

389
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:49,650
He wouldn't look at me.

390
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:52,750
Did you talk to him?

391
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:55,802
I think he just got a little...
A little scared.

392
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:57,920
We should be scared together.

393
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:01,430
He should be able to look at me.

394
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:04,512
Why don't you try to get some rest?

395
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:07,662
We'll do the procedure tomorrow.

396
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:24,422
Can I help you?

397
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:26,571
I'm waiting for dr. Parker.

398
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:33,691
Of course you are.

399
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:35,911
- Do you think he'll be long?
- I don't think so.

400
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:38,880
No, dr. Parker, he's just finishing up
some very important medical

401
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:40,382
- stuff.
- Stuff.

402
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:41,510
Cool.

403
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:47,192
Dell Parker, american hero.

404
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,113
She's waiting for dr. Parker.

405
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:56,610
We need to talk about Dell.
He's late,

406
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,143
he's playing doctor.

407
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:02,391
I gotta go.

408
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:08,942
So, I was going back
over the records,

409
00:20:09,937 --> 00:20:11,581
trying to anticipate

410
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:13,153
every question that

411
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:15,373
they might ask me, and, well,

412
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:17,773
two years ago, your patient

413
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:19,330
had a hernia patched up.

414
00:20:19,548 --> 00:20:21,390
It was just a quick,
20-minute procedure.

415
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:23,071
They gave him morphine for...

416
00:20:23,198 --> 00:20:25,280
- for the pain.
- He wasn't my patient two years ago.

417
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,531
I know, but morphine was overkill.

418
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:32,812
They would've just given him a
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory unless

419
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:35,833
He was allergic to aspirin.

420
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:39,672
Now the aspirin
sensitivity would've...

421
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:41,780
Would've been flagged, on the chart.

422
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:42,962
But it's not.

423
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:44,871
Right. I know it's not, because...

424
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:46,853
See? The page is blank.

425
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:50,161
Now every other page
is filled out meticulously.

426
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,863
This page is blank. You...

427
00:20:53,797 --> 00:20:55,223
You changed out the page.

428
00:20:57,936 --> 00:21:00,161
See, that would explain
why you couldn't revive him.

429
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:03,013
You gave him aspirin, and he was...

430
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,361
It wasn't just a heart attack.

431
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:09,860
I had a barely responsive patient
with severe chest pains.

432
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:11,683
I was racing against the clock.

433
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:14,480
By the time that file came down,
I was losing him.

434
00:21:14,617 --> 00:21:18,060
I couldn't afford to wade through
his whole medical history.

435
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,232
- No doctor would've had time.
- Probably not,

436
00:21:20,357 --> 00:21:22,161
but you could've testified to that.

437
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,292
- I would've backed you up.
- And I would've lost everything.

438
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:30,523
Juries don't care that we see
aspirin sensitivity in what,

439
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:33,182
one out of every thousand patients?

440
00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:36,681
They'd just hear the word
" mistake, "

441
00:21:37,498 --> 00:21:39,280
And nothing else would get by.

442
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,550
Does duncan known about this?

443
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:45,262
He wouldn't have been able to put me
on the stand

444
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,183
to say something
he knows isn't true.

445
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:53,883
Dr. Bennett...

446
00:21:54,985 --> 00:21:55,830
Please.

447
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,980
- You want me to lie for you?
- I want you to speak fully

448
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,790
and honestly about
how I handled that code.

449
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:06,773
Now I had to make a series
of judgment calls, and I did what any

450
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:09,681
good doctor would've,
what you would've.

451
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:12,003
You want me to lie.

452
00:22:12,126 --> 00:22:14,740
They're not gonna
ask about that file.

453
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:16,983
I'm good at what I do.
I save lives.

454
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:19,073
Please.

455
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:26,350
I'm coming!

456
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:36,063
- I was supposed to...
- Cooper's not back yet.

457
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:44,340
You gonna tell me the problem?

458
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:46,490
You were right.

459
00:22:46,968 --> 00:22:48,113
I'm jealous.

460
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:51,830
'm not jealous like I want to be
with him. I'm just jealous like...

461
00:22:52,856 --> 00:22:54,773
I don't want to see him
with anybody else

462
00:22:54,995 --> 00:22:56,871
which is crazy and unfair.

463
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,230
Crazy,

464
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,932
but it makes sense...

465
00:23:00,457 --> 00:23:01,812
Given what you two had...

466
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:03,383
May have.

467
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,743
I know, but it's Pete. It's...

468
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:09,303
It's sleep-with-the-temp Pete,
sleep-with-anything Pete,

469
00:23:09,478 --> 00:23:11,323
I'm-bad-in-a-relationship Pete.

470
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,691
- Good people do bad things.
- Bad...

471
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:15,470
people do bad things.

472
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,271
I would kill for some whipped cream.

473
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:33,553
People change.

474
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:39,190
When they're with the right person,
they can change.

475
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:46,882
I slept with Archer Montgomery...

476
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:50,070
When things were rocky
with Cooper and me.

477
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,303
Coop knows.
He forgave me.

478
00:23:54,477 --> 00:23:55,960
Of course he's gonna forgive you.

479
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,991
He has a neurotic desire to rescue,

480
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:00,281
which makes him susceptible
to hostile dependency.

481
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,242
I confided in you to
make a point about Pete.

482
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:05,271
And maybe you want a little catharsis.
You want a professional

483
00:24:05,475 --> 00:24:07,072
to tell you that it's okay.

484
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,721
- It's not okay.
- You think if I needed absolution,

485
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:11,830
which I don't,
I'd seek out someone who slept

486
00:24:12,138 --> 00:24:14,831
with two men one floor apart, and
didn't have the courage or the decency

487
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:17,261
to figure out let alone tell them
whose baby she's carrying?

488
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:20,032
Everybody's having sex.
Everybody.

489
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:23,360
Governors, they get call girls, girls
sell their virginity on the internet,

490
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:25,942
not a celebrity in
this town goes out

491
00:24:26,468 --> 00:24:28,711
with their underpants on,
but it's my 12-year-old patient

492
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:30,632
who pays the price.
How's that fair?

493
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,471
I'm going to bed.

494
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,220
I'm keeping this.

495
00:24:54,056 --> 00:24:57,263
You savoring the end of a good day
or drowning out a bad one?

496
00:24:59,075 --> 00:25:01,850
The doctor that I'm the expert witness
for did something wrong.

497
00:25:02,215 --> 00:25:04,162
So you have to testify to that.

498
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:07,233
The thing that he did,
the other side doesn't know about.

499
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:10,493
That's the irony.
They know that there's something wrong,

500
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,562
but they're wrong about what it is.

501
00:25:12,796 --> 00:25:17,023
And if they don't ask me anything,
and I don't say anything...

502
00:25:18,587 --> 00:25:19,893
They'll never know.

503
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:25,700
I know how you feel.

504
00:25:28,198 --> 00:25:29,881
Want to talk about it?

505
00:25:33,537 --> 00:25:34,342
I...

506
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:41,561
You can't tell Nai.

507
00:25:42,887 --> 00:25:45,151
- Okay.
- And you can't say anything back...

508
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:47,210
Or make any

509
00:25:47,675 --> 00:25:48,472
faces.

510
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:50,510
- Okay.
- Okay?

511
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:53,743
Okay.

512
00:25:58,827 --> 00:26:01,913
The husband of one of my patients,
there's something...

513
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:07,111
Happening between me and him.

514
00:26:11,098 --> 00:26:14,141
And I don't know if I'm strong enough
to stop it or...

515
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:18,480
If I want to stop it.

516
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:21,622
I don't know.

517
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:25,902
What?

518
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:29,582
I am not saying anything
or making a face.

519
00:26:33,618 --> 00:26:34,611
Thank you.

520
00:26:37,577 --> 00:26:39,683
Having a conscience is brutal.

521
00:26:54,677 --> 00:26:55,810
My boobs hurt.

522
00:26:56,176 --> 00:26:58,973
Did you get sore?
I mean, like, really, really sore?

523
00:26:59,107 --> 00:27:01,221
And I'm exhausted,
and then I lay down,

524
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,632
and it's nothing.

525
00:27:02,835 --> 00:27:04,343
And food tastes different, too.

526
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:06,430
Do you know what I had
for breakfast this morning?

527
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,982
I had tuna fish and whipped cream.
No, it tasted amazing. I don't know.

528
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:12,880
Maybe I'm just looking at things
differently right now.

529
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:14,820
There's just amazing...

530
00:27:15,757 --> 00:27:17,802
Joy to this thing that's just...

531
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:21,473
Amazing. But then the baby's head
starts grinding against my pelvis and...

532
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:25,951
- Oh, what?
- Once you pop this baby out,

533
00:27:26,577 --> 00:27:29,112
- it's all gonna be worth it.
- Look at you, all smiley.

534
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,262
What?

535
00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:33,522
If you had sex last night,
I do not want to hear about it.

536
00:27:34,147 --> 00:27:35,363
No sex, no.

537
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:37,110
Sexy dream.

538
00:27:38,728 --> 00:27:39,671
Duncan.

539
00:27:40,246 --> 00:27:41,263
The suit guy?

540
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:44,090
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah, well, nice in a dream, but,

541
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:47,482
You know, he's one of Sam's oldest
friends. He's working with Sam.

542
00:27:47,908 --> 00:27:49,960
It just... it might be
a little too close to home.

543
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:52,200
You and Sam work together.
Your lives are intertwined.

544
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,870
How are you ever gonna meet
anyone who's not too close to home?

545
00:27:56,088 --> 00:28:00,090
How are any of us ever gonna meet
anyone who's not too close to home?

546
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:02,080
- I think we should amputate.
- Okay.

547
00:28:02,437 --> 00:28:04,270
All right. You ready
for another round?

548
00:28:04,498 --> 00:28:06,523
Sure, but can I use
the bathroom first?

549
00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:08,012
What? You just went.

550
00:28:08,498 --> 00:28:10,162
The guy's got needles in here,

551
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:12,190
and I have a nervous bladder.

552
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:18,331
I don't know what's gotten into him.

553
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,072
I do have needles in here.

554
00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:24,972
I know why Ben likes you.

555
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:29,633
But the real test...
The real test is,

556
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,413
Do you have anything
for stress and exhaustion?

557
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:40,701
How about...

558
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:42,892
A nice long dinner at Casa Del Mar?

559
00:28:44,168 --> 00:28:46,293
Is that a prescription
or an invitation?

560
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:47,603
Both.

561
00:28:53,226 --> 00:28:54,430
She's pregnant?

562
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:56,753
Oh, my God.

563
00:28:58,638 --> 00:29:00,071
You're gonna be okay, Sarah.

564
00:29:00,746 --> 00:29:02,530
How soon...
How soon can we,

565
00:29:03,198 --> 00:29:04,320
take care of it?

566
00:29:06,448 --> 00:29:08,512
I'm so sorry.
I should've never let this happen,

567
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:09,991
but I will fix it.

568
00:29:10,186 --> 00:29:11,541
Let's all just take a breath,

569
00:29:11,678 --> 00:29:13,962
okay?
This is new and it's hard and it's

570
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:15,480
very scary. But

571
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:18,453
there are a lot of factors
to consider before we...

572
00:29:19,165 --> 00:29:20,732
Get to that point, okay?

573
00:29:23,097 --> 00:29:24,041
You okay?

574
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:32,323
I know this is scary, and you shouldn't
have to go through this at your age.

575
00:29:32,535 --> 00:29:33,912
We've heard your point of view

576
00:29:34,037 --> 00:29:36,102
and of course
she shouldn't have to go through it.

577
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:38,081
She's having an abortion.

578
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,483
- This is where you put your foot down?
- She's 12 years old.

579
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:42,421
And where did you
think it was leading?

580
00:29:42,546 --> 00:29:44,002
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

581
00:29:48,715 --> 00:29:50,551
I want to keep the baby.

582
00:30:04,665 --> 00:30:07,282
Hey, Violet, I asked Lisa out.
Ben's mom.

583
00:30:08,048 --> 00:30:10,612
It's not wrong, I'm doing it openly,
and I don't want to fight about it

584
00:30:10,747 --> 00:30:11,800
so I'm telling you.

585
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:12,800
I understand.

586
00:30:12,935 --> 00:30:15,323
I'm trying to do the right thing here,
whatever that is,

587
00:30:15,778 --> 00:30:16,583
and...

588
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,910
But I also need to have a life.

589
00:30:19,927 --> 00:30:21,011
You should.

590
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:24,710
Thanks.

591
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,913
- You need to back off in there.
- How... How are we s...

592
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:39,671
Forget it.

593
00:30:42,255 --> 00:30:43,133
Good morning.

594
00:30:43,515 --> 00:30:46,130
I went out pretty hard last night.
I felt like crap this morning, so...

595
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,261
What, so you just decided
to sleep in?

596
00:30:48,537 --> 00:30:50,491
Actually, I was up early,
but I had bed spins.

597
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:52,160
Then I saw it was 3 to 5 and glassy.

598
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:54,493
Figured I'd get an hour in the water
before I headed here.

599
00:30:54,616 --> 00:30:57,073
- This is not you.
- Maybe this is me,

600
00:30:57,205 --> 00:31:00,130
and maybe since I'm only 24, I should
be able to go out and have a little fun.

601
00:31:00,256 --> 00:31:02,770
No one's saying you can't have any fun.
But you've responsibilities here

602
00:31:02,907 --> 00:31:05,433
I'm sick of trying to work so hard
to do the right thing all the time.

603
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:06,642
Work full-time,

604
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:09,782
get licensed, act like an adult...
who cares? Who cares?

605
00:31:13,225 --> 00:31:17,390
Your sats look good. I'll have the nurse
come and prep you for the cerclage,

606
00:31:17,758 --> 00:31:20,853
- and I will meet you in the O.R.
- Have you see Noah?

607
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:22,951
He's not here yet?

608
00:31:23,226 --> 00:31:24,190
He hasn't come

609
00:31:24,496 --> 00:31:25,741
or answered the phone.

610
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:29,733
- I'll page him. Maybe he's in surgery.
- I already tried.

611
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:31,162
He's not.

612
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:34,611
I can't do this without him.

613
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,062
We can't wait on this.
We have to do it now.

614
00:31:38,305 --> 00:31:39,651
Then find him for me.

615
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:41,563
Please.

616
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:43,280
Just find him.

617
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:53,491
What was so important I had to run
up here in the middle of my day?

618
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:55,163
I want to throttle someone.

619
00:31:55,398 --> 00:31:57,870
- You gotta be kidding.
- I'm so... I'm serious. I just had to

620
00:31:58,148 --> 00:32:00,412
I had to walk out of a consult
so I didn't explode

621
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:03,032
at the mother of my
12-year-old patient... My pregnant

622
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:06,160
12-year-old patient... whose mother has
decided all of a sudden she's interested

623
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:07,503
in parenting again.

624
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,903
I should've called D.C.F.S.

625
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:11,651
Coop, isn't this what you wanted,

626
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:14,113
- for her to step up and parent?
- Parent?

627
00:32:15,355 --> 00:32:17,380
She is dictating an abortion
to a 12 year old.

628
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:18,680
Is she wrong?

629
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:24,870
Probably not.

630
00:32:25,865 --> 00:32:29,403
I see what it is doing to that girl
and what it's going to be doing to her.

631
00:32:30,297 --> 00:32:31,403
And I find that

632
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:32,612
hard...

633
00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:34,073
To forgive.

634
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:36,211
You forgave me...

635
00:32:36,878 --> 00:32:37,882
For worse.

636
00:32:42,806 --> 00:32:44,242
- What happened?
- I don't know.

637
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:46,633
He called me from a friend's house,
said he's having trouble swallowing

638
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:48,940
and then in the car, he said
he was feeling dizzy.

639
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:50,953
Maybe I should've brought him
to the hospital.

640
00:32:51,077 --> 00:32:53,010
That's okay. We'll take care
of him right here.

641
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:55,732
He never had a problem with food.
It's only been environmental.

642
00:32:55,855 --> 00:32:58,931
Problems can start at any age,
and Ben's a highly allergic kid.

643
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:03,852
- Something's... Wrong.
- You're having an acute allergic attack

644
00:33:03,985 --> 00:33:05,523
but you're gonna be okay.
I'll take care of you,

645
00:33:05,656 --> 00:33:07,302
I just have to grab
a couple of things.

646
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:10,122
He's gonna get some medicine. You're
gonna feel better in just a little bit,

647
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:12,770
I'm right here. I'm right here.
It's gonna be okay.

648
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,092
You're gonna feel better
in just a couple more seconds.

649
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:18,553
I'm gonna give you some adrenaline.
It's gonna open up your airway.

650
00:33:37,566 --> 00:33:39,803
Is your throat opening?
You getting some air?

651
00:33:46,605 --> 00:33:48,772
- It's working.
- Thank you.

652
00:33:48,908 --> 00:33:50,443
You're gonna be okay.

653
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:52,752
Thank you.

654
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,303
So based on
your years of experience,

655
00:33:56,548 --> 00:34:00,290
the dozens of cardiac patients
that you have personally attended to,

656
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:02,941
in your professional opinion,
dr. Bennett,

657
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,851
Did dr. Allen do everything that he
reasonably could do to save the patient?

658
00:34:11,726 --> 00:34:12,932
Yes, he did.

659
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:15,913
Is there anything
that you would've done differently?

660
00:34:24,357 --> 00:34:26,950
Given what dr. Allen
knew at the time,

661
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:28,800
no.

662
00:34:31,185 --> 00:34:32,991
No further questions.

663
00:34:34,187 --> 00:34:35,111
Recross.

664
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:42,622
What do you mean, "given what
dr. Allen knew at the time"?

665
00:34:42,758 --> 00:34:44,792
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

666
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:47,573
Overruled.
You may answer the question.

667
00:34:53,255 --> 00:34:55,500
Dr. Allen was working so fast,

668
00:34:56,277 --> 00:34:59,001
and he was under so much pressure...

669
00:35:00,537 --> 00:35:04,142
That he didn't stop to look
at the patient's full medical history.

670
00:35:05,006 --> 00:35:06,230
So he was not aware

671
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:09,203
that Martin Weiser
had an aspirin allergy.

672
00:35:15,487 --> 00:35:17,572
That's not in any of our discovery.

673
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:21,282
That's because, dr. Allen
swapped out one of the pages

674
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:22,831
from the file.

675
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:25,460
He lied?

676
00:35:27,285 --> 00:35:28,092
Yes.

677
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,652
You should've come to me
and told me what you found.

678
00:35:40,776 --> 00:35:42,681
That would've put you
in an impossible position.

679
00:35:42,817 --> 00:35:45,553
- And you thought this would be better?
- You wanted me here as an expert,

680
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:46,510
a doctor.

681
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,651
That means I'm asking people
to trust me with their lives every day.

682
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:52,461
Now part of that trust
means telling the truth.

683
00:35:52,837 --> 00:35:55,402
Even when it's hard,
I have to tell the truth.

684
00:35:55,855 --> 00:35:57,630
You should've come to me.

685
00:36:03,898 --> 00:36:05,763
You want to tell me
what you're doing?

686
00:36:06,257 --> 00:36:07,452
I can't look at her.

687
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:10,342
- She'll see it in my eyes.
- It's time for her surgery, Noah.

688
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:11,960
- Look, I'm cheating on her.
- No

689
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:13,651
In my soul, I am...

690
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:15,960
I'm cheating on her.
She deserves more.

691
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,311
- What kind of man...
- No, listen to me.

692
00:36:18,836 --> 00:36:21,591
Your wife is about to have a procedure
that scares the hell out of her.

693
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:24,021
She's upstairs, she's alone
and she needs you.

694
00:36:24,457 --> 00:36:26,402
What kind of man are you?
You're the kind of man

695
00:36:26,536 --> 00:36:28,742
who puts his own feelings aside,
as hard as that might be,

696
00:36:29,058 --> 00:36:31,353
and goes in that O.R.
and holds his wife's hand.

697
00:36:32,736 --> 00:36:34,672
That's the kind of man you are.

698
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:54,601
I screwed up.

699
00:36:55,887 --> 00:36:57,753
I had my chance to be a parent, and

700
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:01,320
I screwed up. Now she doesn't care
what I have to say.

701
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:03,423
You know what she told me?

702
00:37:04,376 --> 00:37:07,251
That she's the baby's mother,
so she gets to decide.

703
00:37:07,385 --> 00:37:10,353
She's right.
You can't force her to have an abortion.

704
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:13,503
But you're still her mother.

705
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:16,511
And if she's gonna be a parent,
she's gonna need you even more.

706
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,321
Sarah is still a child,
and she as a lot to learn

707
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:24,403
- from you.
- You think she'll listen to me?

708
00:37:25,278 --> 00:37:27,682
I think you have to keep trying.

709
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:43,762
- I didn't think you were coming.
- I'm here.

710
00:37:44,426 --> 00:37:47,022
- Tell me it's gonna be okay.
- It is.

711
00:37:47,885 --> 00:37:49,731
Everything's gonna be okay.

712
00:38:04,425 --> 00:38:06,070
How'd the testimony go?

713
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:10,832
- It was complicated.
- Complicated good, or complicated bad?

714
00:38:13,496 --> 00:38:17,643
You want to come down by the water
with me, have a drink, I'll tell you?

715
00:38:18,036 --> 00:38:20,390
- I have plans, so...
- Oh, okay.

716
00:38:22,128 --> 00:38:23,882
I'm going out with Duncan.

717
00:38:25,165 --> 00:38:26,341
Really? Oh. Okay.

718
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:28,122
- So tomorrow?
- Sure.

719
00:38:28,768 --> 00:38:29,582
Sure.

720
00:38:37,037 --> 00:38:38,770
- How you doing?
- You look fantastic.

721
00:38:38,907 --> 00:38:39,701
I do?

722
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:41,052
Thank you.

723
00:38:50,918 --> 00:38:53,513
What do you think you're doing?
Spare me the sermon, okay?

724
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:56,073
Naomi's already
preached to me twice.

725
00:38:56,328 --> 00:38:58,803
This isn't a sermon,
and I'm not preaching.

726
00:38:58,935 --> 00:39:00,831
I'm telling you to cut the crap.

727
00:39:01,628 --> 00:39:04,462
Now I know that Heather took Betsey,
and you're hurting,

728
00:39:04,597 --> 00:39:07,342
but that does not give you carte blanche
to blow this job off

729
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,373
or treat this place
with any disrespect.

730
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,750
This is a top-notch
private medical practice,

731
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:14,453
and everybody around here
is gonna act like it at all times,

732
00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:18,322
no matter what's going on
in their private lives, including you.

733
00:39:18,955 --> 00:39:20,771
Pete is on a date
with a patient's mother,

734
00:39:20,897 --> 00:39:23,341
which follows him sleeping with a
coworker or three.

735
00:39:23,466 --> 00:39:24,621
Violet got knocked up,

736
00:39:24,758 --> 00:39:27,343
probably in this exact same office,
the same office where you and Naomi

737
00:39:27,477 --> 00:39:28,850
You better stop it right there.

738
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:30,441
This ends here.

739
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:32,940
You're gonna take your ass home,
get some sleep,

740
00:39:33,195 --> 00:39:36,421
come back first thing tomorrow
morning with a better attitude.

741
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:42,511
You've got a family
who needs you here, Dell.

742
00:39:56,378 --> 00:39:57,683
Gimmie pizza!
Gimmie pizza!

743
00:39:58,017 --> 00:39:59,701
- All right, all right.
- Gimmie pizza!

744
00:39:59,836 --> 00:40:01,143
All right. Here.

745
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:09,172
All right, margaritas,
chimichangas...

746
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:10,781
You ready, amiga?

747
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:13,652
What?

748
00:40:14,517 --> 00:40:17,731
Violet's crazy and hostile
and needy, and

749
00:40:17,866 --> 00:40:19,421
she drives me up a wall...

750
00:40:21,617 --> 00:40:23,383
But she needs you, Coop.

751
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,550
Go home.

752
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:50,681
I don't know...

753
00:40:50,955 --> 00:40:51,963
Why I'm here.

754
00:40:52,115 --> 00:40:53,053
I just...

755
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:54,870
I couldn't...

756
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:47,312
