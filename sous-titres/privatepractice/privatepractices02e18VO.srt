1
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:05,839
Surfing?
You're into surfing now?

2
00:00:05,869 --> 00:00:07,056
You should see her room.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,687
She's got surf posters everywhere.

4
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:10,201
As soon as my heart is better,

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,152
I'm gonna have a birthday party
on the beach,

6
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:13,609
and I'm gonna learn how to surf.

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,265
I've been watching them from my
window, and it's totally cool.

8
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,933
That sounds totally awesome.

9
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:19,330
So how's our patient doing?

10
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,530
This is Dr. Barnes.

11
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:22,962
Dr. Barnes is gonna remove
the tumor from your heart.

12
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,591
What happened to the other guy?

13
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:26,584
This guy's much better
than the other guy.

14
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:29,613
Dr. Barnes is the best heart guy in L.A.
This is gonna be your last surgery.

15
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:33,573
That's how good he is. And so I snagged
him for you because I'm on your side.

16
00:00:34,846 --> 00:00:38,293
It is a 6-hour procedure, so we should
probably get going. Right?

17
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:41,830
- You'll be here when I come out?
- I'll be here.

18
00:00:48,818 --> 00:00:50,231
Don't look so scared.

19
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:51,821
It's gonna be fine.

20
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:15,773
- Finishing or starting?
- Finishing. You?

21
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:17,311
Starting.

22
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:21,282
I've got myocardial resection on a kid.
I hate working on kids.

23
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,200
I feel like I'm holding my breath
the entire time.

24
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:27,741
I know what you mean.
I work on babies sometimes.

25
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:29,671
So you... come here often?

26
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:35,280
Was... that actually sounded
like a... was that a pickup line?

27
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:38,140
That... I apologize.

28
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,261
Besides, I would...

29
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:45,650
I would give a better
pickup line than that.

30
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:54,871
I'm... not into this.

31
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:56,990
The bug needs stimulation.
I'm the pediatrician.

32
00:01:57,157 --> 00:01:59,242
This is my area.
Hello, little one.

33
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,873
- I'm stimulating the bug.
- We've made a decision.

34
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:06,182
- Together?
- Paternity test, now.

35
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:09,173
One of us gets out of your hair,
the other one has a right to know.

36
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,631
- Look...
- You know what?

37
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:12,140
You moved in, you pushed us out,

38
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,340
you've claimed your territory,
but one thing is clear...

39
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,920
This kid you're talking to is not
your kid. So stay out of it.

40
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:19,720
The answer is right there
for us to know.

41
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:22,593
We know that you don't want
to face it, but we do.

42
00:02:22,755 --> 00:02:23,862
I've gotta go.

43
00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:29,731
I have no defining exit line, so...

44
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:39,280
They told me it was a carjacking.

45
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:40,590
They told you?

46
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:42,162
You don't remember?

47
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,233
I remember leaving soccer practice.

48
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:47,370
I'd parked across campus
in student parking.

49
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:50,390
I got to my car.
There were people around.

50
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:52,472
I pulled out my keys,

51
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:55,130
and I heard a noise behind me,
and...

52
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:58,181
That's all I remember.

53
00:02:58,308 --> 00:02:59,901
Woke up in the ambulance.

54
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:02,013
I loved that car.

55
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:03,640
I love school.

56
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:05,961
This guy came into my world and...

57
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,192
I'm pissed.

58
00:03:07,316 --> 00:03:09,942
I'd like you to see
our psychiatrist Dr. Turner.

59
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,681
- 'Cause other than pissed, I'm okay.
- Just...

60
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:14,852
do me the favor
so you stay that way.

61
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:16,791
You know what'll make me okay?

62
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:18,802
When they catch this guy.

63
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:23,621
<i>Private Practice S02E18
Finishing</i>

64
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:38,602
Are you snooping?

65
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:41,091
This is public space.
I'm just standing here.

66
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:42,153
Snooping.

67
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:43,672
Do you want to know
what's going on or not?

68
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:44,882
Of course I do.

69
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,433
Possible baby daddies
demanded paternity test.

70
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:51,183
Said my name during sex with her.

71
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:52,400
Wait a minute.

72
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:54,261
How do you know all this,
just by watching?

73
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:55,721
What, do you read lips now?

74
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:57,792
Sam told me the whole name thing.

75
00:03:58,045 --> 00:03:58,860
What?

76
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:02,473
We are friends. He tells me stuff.
We're just friends.

77
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:06,003
And violet was yelling so loud,
it just...

78
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:08,172
Oh, god.
He called out your name.

79
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:11,561
I'm the only person that the man
has had sex with in the last 15 years.

80
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:14,523
It was just habit. That's all.
We're just friends.

81
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:18,723
I wish someone would call out another
woman's name in bed with me.

82
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,931
I'd even take not knowing
who the father of my baby was.

83
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:24,701
Either way, it would mean that I'd had
a man on top of me in recent history.

84
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:26,973
- You know what? That's really sad.
- I know.

85
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:28,942
I thought somebody
was trying to pick me up...

86
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:31,471
And I felt my knees
open just a little bit.

87
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:33,593
I don't want to spoil the fun,

88
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:35,332
but I've got Betsey
with me today, and

89
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:37,732
"say my name" and "who's your daddy"
are getting a little loud,

90
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:40,541
and I don't want to have to explain what
a paternity test is to my 6 year old.

91
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:42,393
I'm not telling 'em to shut up.

92
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:43,913
No, me neither.

93
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:47,343
I will have a paternity test when
I want to have a paternity test.

94
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:49,060
You can't do one for
a few weeks anyway.

95
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:51,462
Who do they think they are,
telling me what to do? It's my body.

96
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:52,772
- It's my uterus.
- You can't do one for

97
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:54,623
- a few weeks anyway.
- I mean, yes, I was...

98
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:58,171
A little bit irresponsible,
having unprotected sex with two men,

99
00:04:58,296 --> 00:05:00,263
but does that give them
the right to dictate...

100
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,960
You can't do a C.V.S.
paternity test for a few weeks.

101
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:04,400
The point is mute.

102
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:05,592
Moot.

103
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:07,641
- The point is moot.
- Is it "moot"?

104
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,692
- I'm pretty sure it's "mute."
- It's moot. The point is moot.

105
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:13,191
I can't have a paternity
test for weeks.

106
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:16,313
I didn't come here to...
I need you to see a patient.

107
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:19,081
Is the point moot
or is the point mute?

108
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:22,063
Annie's out of surgery.

109
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:27,621
Where's the patient?

110
00:05:27,748 --> 00:05:30,132
You were in bed with me, and
you called out another woman's name.

111
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:33,620
I know, and... it was wrong,
but I was not thinking about her.

112
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:35,932
It just slipped out.
I promise.

113
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:38,451
- What... please, what are you...
- I have to go to work.

114
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:41,142
And you've explained yourself
as best you could, I guess.

115
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:44,971
Have a good day, Sonya. See? There.
Sonya. See? I s... I know it.

116
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:47,081
It's a beautiful name.
Sonya...

117
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:53,720
You're just in the doghouse,
you know?

118
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:56,821
You're just gonna have to suffer,
just for a little bit.

119
00:05:57,447 --> 00:06:00,023
Maybe I should make her dinner tonight,
you know, go all out...

120
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:02,071
Candlelight, flowers, the works.

121
00:06:02,408 --> 00:06:06,502
You need to take her out. Take her out
somewhere nice, somewhere romantic.

122
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:09,282
The Blue Sea in Malibu.

123
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,170
The Blue Sea,
the place we used to go?

124
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:13,780
The place with the great mimosas
that you drank way too many of.

125
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,093
The Blue Sea.
That sounds perfect.

126
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:18,543
The memory loss is not unusual,

127
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,451
and it's not
necessarily a bad thing.

128
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:23,372
- You're protecting yourself.
- I don't want to protect myself.

129
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:26,293
- I want to remember.
- The memory may come out naturally,

130
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:28,722
- when you're ready to deal with it.
- I'm ready to deal with it.

131
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:31,742
I want to help the police find this guy,
and I can't unless I remember.

132
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:33,600
I don't want to be a victim.

133
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:36,771
I want to find this guy
and rip his throat out.

134
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:43,602
Close your eyes.

135
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:52,920
So I want you to think about
something you like.

136
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,582
Griffith Park.

137
00:06:54,765 --> 00:06:56,671
- I like riding horses.
- Good.

138
00:06:57,907 --> 00:07:00,533
So I want you to
see it in your mind,

139
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:04,411
like you're sitting in a movie
theater watching it on a screen.

140
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,601
Describe what you see.

141
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,512
The horse is chestnut

142
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:11,890
with a white streak
down the side of his neck.

143
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:15,000
We're riding off the trail,
up a hill,

144
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:18,432
then we cut through some trees,
cantering.

145
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,351
Good.

146
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:24,164
So you're relaxed,
and you're feeling that,

147
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:27,823
only the picture on
the screen is going to change.

148
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:29,783
Focus on the screen.

149
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:33,051
You see your car, you see yourself.

150
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:39,002
Now don't bring
everything into focus,

151
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:41,912
and you can look away
anytime you need to. But...

152
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:44,872
do you see anything
about the attacker?

153
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:48,771
His arm...

154
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:50,011
his hand.

155
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:52,831
He was white.
The guy was white.

156
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:58,073
I can remember this, can't i?

157
00:07:58,955 --> 00:08:01,311
- You can help me remember?
- I'll try.

158
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:05,140
It always starts with the cramping.

159
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,412
My husband and I can't
go through this again.

160
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:10,640
I didn't even tell him
this time because...

161
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:12,610
We just can't take losing another...

162
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:16,353
Miscarrying once is hard enough.
But twice must be...

163
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:19,340
We're not even telling friends
and family about the baby this time.

164
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,310
I think I know why you're cramping.

165
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:24,443
The placenta is implanting
low on the uterine wall,

166
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:27,892
and that can cause bleeding
as the pregnancy progresses.

167
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:30,182
- Is that dangerous?
- It can be

168
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:33,060
unless we can do something about it,
and in this case, you can.

169
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:34,312
Sure. What?

170
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:35,503
Anything.

171
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:38,723
- No sex.
- No sex is the treatment?

172
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:45,853
No sex.

173
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:51,451
We'll just spend our evenings reading...
and talking and not having sex.

174
00:08:51,828 --> 00:08:55,471
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm not having any sex either.

175
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,431
Your tumor was bigger
than we expected.

176
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:04,140
We weren't able to remove all of it.

177
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,150
But Dr. Barnes thinks that more chemo
will shrink this tumor,

178
00:09:07,277 --> 00:09:09,791
and in another month,
he can take it out completely.

179
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:15,483
That's what you said last time...

180
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:19,550
And the time before that.
And then this was supposed to help.

181
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:22,391
But none of it helps.
Just more hospitals...

182
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:26,483
More medication,
staying inside all the time.

183
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:29,863
- I don't want anymore.
- Don't talk like that.

184
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:31,841
It'll be okay. You'll see.

185
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:35,083
No, it won't.
I don't want anymore surgery.

186
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:42,422
You promised you were on my side.

187
00:09:42,855 --> 00:09:44,952
Tell them no more surgery.

188
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:03,482
- Finishing or starting?
- Finishing. You?

189
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:06,001
- Starting.
- Our timing.

190
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,050
My pickup lines
are usually just honesty.

191
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,812
I don't have any lines.

192
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:17,891
For instance?

193
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:21,372
- Honesty?
- Honesty.

194
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:27,273
You are breathtakingly beautiful.

195
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:31,672
That's what I'd say,

196
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,181
you know, if I were trying
to pick you up.

197
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:36,193
How was that?

198
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:38,803
That was good.

199
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:51,941
You missed the window.
For the C.V.S. test.

200
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,901
- The risks of puncturing the placenta...
- Minimal.

201
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:56,422
But it's... there.

202
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:59,422
- You, too?
- She missed the window.

203
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:02,923
Paternity, C.V.S.
Window, it's... gone.

204
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,502
So amnio?
You're far enough along for an amnio.

205
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:07,130
There are risks to...

206
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:11,333
I'll consider it.

207
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:15,102
And... while you're at it, will you
consider backing off with Jill?

208
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:17,611
She's in my office,
and her body is a mess.

209
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:20,163
- Her muscle pain is unreal.
- She's injured.

210
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,422
She was injured before the attack.
You were treating her.

211
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:24,692
For a rotator cuff tear.
She was getting better.

212
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,780
Her treatment was nearly done.
Since the attack...

213
00:11:26,846 --> 00:11:29,002
Her injuries are not muscular.
Pulling up those memories,

214
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:30,970
- that's what's eating at her.
- If i can walk her through the attack,

215
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:32,803
then I can desensitize her
to the memory.

216
00:11:32,848 --> 00:11:34,751
But then you run the risk
of retraumatizing her,

217
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:36,582
which her body tells me
is what's happening.

218
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:37,783
You should be careful.

219
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:39,612
With a trauma,
if she's internalizing...

220
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:41,813
I've seen people get really sick.

221
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:45,213
So now you're ganging up on me
about everything?

222
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:48,711
I'm doing what's best for Jill.
Are there bumps along the way?

223
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:50,912
But in the end,
it's best that she knows now.

224
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:53,420
She wants to get this guy
who did this to her.

225
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,172
So if she remembers, she can put
him away and have her life back.

226
00:11:56,297 --> 00:11:57,510
That's interesting.

227
00:11:57,696 --> 00:12:01,133
Sometimes you think it's better
to know. And others...

228
00:12:01,627 --> 00:12:03,171
Denial works for you.

229
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:11,043
- What is it?
- The man who attacked me,

230
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,911
they think they found him.
They want me to come in for a lineup.

231
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,071
Your face is all scowly.

232
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:25,982
Scowly?

233
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:28,153
You didn't light up
as soon as you saw me.

234
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:29,650
This is me, lit.

235
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:33,472
What... What's wrong?

236
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:38,003
I mean, you've been kind of...
We've been in a better place?

237
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:40,143
We started fresh?

238
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:43,021
I slept with Archer, and you
forgave me. Better place, fresh start.

239
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:43,942
But?

240
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:50,553
But nothing. Everything's fine.
We're in a good place, really.

241
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:01,392
- You're looking...
- Don't tell me I look good.

242
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:02,972
Because I don't.

243
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:11,061
Here's some good news.
I just looked over your labs, and

244
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:12,822
the chemo is doing
what it's supposed to.

245
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:13,790
It's getting you ready for the surgery.

246
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,583
The chemo is making me sick

247
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:18,403
I've tried to tell my parents
I don't want this surgery,

248
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:20,593
- but they won't listen to me.
- I know this is hard,

249
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:22,993
- but you gotta try to hang in there.
- Hang in for what?

250
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:24,972
I know what dr. Barnes
wants to do for me.

251
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,221
The surgery stinks. Only 20%
of the people who have it

252
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:31,322
- live for more than six months.
- And that can be you.

253
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,071
I know I'm sick,

254
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:37,242
and my heart is really bad,

255
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:39,513
and if I do nothing, I'm gonna die.

256
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:40,902
But this surgery?

257
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:43,173
Chances are it's not gonna work.

258
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:48,212
And if I was off this medication, I
could really feel good for a little bit.

259
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:51,412
I could play with my friends again.

260
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:54,660
If I had this out of my arm...

261
00:13:54,955 --> 00:13:56,650
I could go in the ocean.

262
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:59,082
I could be normal for a little bit.

263
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:01,980
I'd rather have one good day

264
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:05,173
than be sick for the rest of my life.

265
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:09,642
- The bleeding started this morning?
- In the shower.

266
00:14:09,768 --> 00:14:12,983
I've been doing everything
you told me... no sex,

267
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:15,550
taking it easy.
I even cut back my hours at work.

268
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:18,312
- This shouldn't be happening.
- The placenta previa hasn't improved.

269
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:20,160
So I'm just gonna keep
losing babies...

270
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:22,733
One after another after another?

271
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:24,571
Look at me.

272
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:27,951
You are stressed. And if you're
stressed, then the baby's stressed.

273
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,123
You are not going to lose this baby.

274
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:32,262
It just means that we need
to be more aggressive.

275
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:34,631
I'm gonna put you on total bed rest

276
00:14:34,845 --> 00:14:37,480
for the remainder of your pregnancy,
and then I'm gonna watch you

277
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:38,853
very carefully.

278
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:40,671
I want an amnio.

279
00:14:40,955 --> 00:14:43,713
If I'm gonna lay on my back
for 5 months, I need to know

280
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:46,733
this baby's gonna be okay,
you know, that there aren't any

281
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:50,692
- genetic defects.
- An amnio is usually done at 17 weeks.

282
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:52,223
We need to wait another month.

283
00:14:52,348 --> 00:14:53,653
- What if...
- No what-ifs.

284
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:54,792
We're gonna wait.

285
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:57,611
We're gonna do the amnio
at the right time.

286
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:05,481
I'm at the doctor's office.
She's putting me on bed rest.

287
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:09,641
She's not letting me into the bed.

288
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:11,673
There's no sex.

289
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:13,691
And you need sex.

290
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:16,623
I'm grown.

291
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:20,331
Dinners are cool, restaurants are cool,
but she has me sleeping on the floor.

292
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:22,580
Come on, Sam. Be smart.

293
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:24,231
You gotta change the scenery.

294
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:26,421
You gotta make her forget
what happened. You gotta...

295
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:27,940
take her away to...

296
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:30,680
I don't know, take her to...
the grand spa in Palm Springs.

297
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:33,261
I remember we had
a really good time there.

298
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:36,372
That first weekend after Maya,
ust the two of us.

299
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:38,602
We certainly forgot about everything.

300
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:40,720
That was great.
That was fun.

301
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:44,283
- I have Maya this weekend, though.
- I will take Maya. You go.

302
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:46,752
Go have fun. Go?
Whisk her away. Go.

303
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:48,111
Whisk.

304
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,061
We don't know what to do.

305
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,173
She's miserable and sick,
and she doesn't want this.

306
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:57,921
And she makes sense,
but she's only 12.

307
00:15:58,048 --> 00:15:59,750
She still loves stuffed animals.

308
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,053
She giggles when
she has to talk to boys.

309
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:04,801
Anytime there's thunder,
she comes to sleep between us.

310
00:16:04,926 --> 00:16:06,282
I don't want to lose her, but

311
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,461
I can't stand forcing her to do
something that she doesn't want to do.

312
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:11,292
You really think you can help her?

313
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:15,013
I know it's hard, watching her.
But I think if I operate,

314
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:17,223
- there's a chance she'll make it.
- A chance.

315
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,272
You don't think
she should have the surgery?

316
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:24,851
I don't wanna...

317
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:28,401
- This is your decision.
- I'm asking you. Please.

318
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:32,562
I think even in the best-case scenario,
it's months in a hospital,

319
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,602
constant drug therapies
and interventions,

320
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,691
and this is not about a cure.

321
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:39,232
However,
considering the alternative...

322
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:41,491
Wait a minute.
Go on, Dr. Cooper.

323
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:43,732
I want to know what you think.

324
00:16:46,395 --> 00:16:48,313
I think Annie has considered
the alternative.

325
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:50,552
And even though it
terrifies us, for her,

326
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:53,660
the alternative means having
a life, a real life

327
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:56,392
like other kids, even if
it's just for a little while.

328
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:59,553
You know, playing outside
and maybe going surfing and...

329
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:02,002
Instead of spending her life...

330
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,382
In that little room
we have down the hall.

331
00:17:05,505 --> 00:17:09,051
It means celebrating her birthday
somewhere other than here.

332
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:13,572
In the future, we will be able
to treat people with Annie's condition

333
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:16,310
much more effectively.
She doesn't have the perspective

334
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,501
to understand that
because she's still a kid.

335
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:20,731
You can't put a decision like this
in her hands.

336
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:24,082
If the surgery works,
what will her quality of life be?

337
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:25,242
It's hard to know.

338
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:29,413
She'll be limited in her activities.
You'll need to keep her home mostly.

339
00:17:29,656 --> 00:17:33,003
But with medications, we can sustain
her heart. She'll be alive.

340
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:34,500
For how long?

341
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,843
I want to take her home.

342
00:17:58,685 --> 00:18:01,280
Wait. You're the one
from the scrub room.

343
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:03,953
I didn't realize 'cause of the hair.

344
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:06,912
I had this image of it in my head,
you know, under the cap, and...

345
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:08,730
You didn't recognize me.

346
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:11,293
But red.

347
00:18:11,418 --> 00:18:12,512
Red is good.

348
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,551
Red becomes you.

349
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,120
Thank you.

350
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:18,562
Look, I'm sorry.
I am...

351
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:20,250
I am having a day.

352
00:18:20,606 --> 00:18:23,901
I got some bad news,
and then I've got this patient...

353
00:18:24,028 --> 00:18:27,373
Another doctor has convinced
her parents to let her die,

354
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:29,200
which I think... I know...

355
00:18:29,327 --> 00:18:30,792
Is the wrong decision.

356
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:32,263
Anyway, it's a...

357
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,170
a day.

358
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:36,383
You ever do that? You ever

359
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:39,043
- worry over a patient?
- Absolutely. I'm

360
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:42,292
worrying over this pregnant woman
right now.

361
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:45,502
Charlotte King

362
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,420
Is that your name?

363
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:49,170
No, she's...

364
00:18:49,397 --> 00:18:52,341
- the chief of staff here.
- Right. I knew that.

365
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:54,292
You should talk to her.

366
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:58,011
If you believe your patient should live,
then you should fight for it.

367
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,982
And Charlotte... I mean,
she's Charlotte, but she...

368
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,893
- She'll help you fight.
- Thank you.

369
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,062
No problem.

370
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:09,443
I should...

371
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:11,603
go...

372
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:14,152
- See Charlotte.
- Right, of course.

373
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:27,781
If you see the man who assaulted you,

374
00:19:27,838 --> 00:19:31,111
please identify him by stating
aloud his reference number.

375
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,660
Take as much time as you need.

376
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:46,320
5.

377
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,310
You've indicated suspect number 5.

378
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:50,320
Are you sure that's the man
who attacked you?

379
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:51,591
I'm sure. 5.

380
00:19:51,718 --> 00:19:53,311
All right, miss Avery.

381
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:55,890
Thank you for your cooperation.

382
00:19:59,828 --> 00:20:00,873
You did it.

383
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:02,420
The face...

384
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:06,273
- Seeing it again, it's...
- It's okay.

385
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:09,210
- He can't hurt you anymore.
- I thought it would be good.

386
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:12,690
I thought it would help me remember
what he did to me. But it...

387
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:14,491
It's just...

388
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,590
I'm scared.

389
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,112
I'm really scared.

390
00:20:23,398 --> 00:20:24,990
I can't believe it's coming out.

391
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:28,432
I'm gonna get to go in the water
for the first time ever, ever.

392
00:20:29,665 --> 00:20:31,290
Can I see you for a sec?

393
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:33,963
- What's going on?
- Just give us a sec.

394
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:41,030
- Catheter is not coming out today.
- What?

395
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,081
Dr. Barnes approached me.
He feels he can save Annie's life

396
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:46,740
and that you're letting a minor make
a decision about refusing treatment.

397
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:48,190
The family and I concur on this.
What are you doing?

398
00:20:48,216 --> 00:20:49,310
He has a valid claim.

399
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:51,480
- He's going for a court order.
- Why are you talking to me like that?

400
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,720
- Like what?
- Like I'm some stranger.

401
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:56,552
I could've let him sandbag you.
I didn't. I'm giving you a heads-up.

402
00:20:56,677 --> 00:20:58,983
Still like a stranger,
and you know me.

403
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:01,481
You know I wouldn't be doing this
for her if I didn't think it was right.

404
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:02,501
Come on.

405
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:06,921
- I'm just doing my job.
- That doesn't make it right.

406
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:13,720
There was definitely flirting.
With the surgeon?

407
00:21:13,846 --> 00:21:15,182
Cute surgeon.

408
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:17,253
- Cute surgeon.
- It felt...

409
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:20,112
to feel like me again.

410
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:24,293
Can I steal some of those
colored paper clips?

411
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:26,192
On your desk?

412
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:28,241
For an art project
that Betsey's doing?

413
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:29,761
She's in a trance.

414
00:21:34,805 --> 00:21:35,832
Resort porn.

415
00:21:36,118 --> 00:21:37,263
Look at this.

416
00:21:37,388 --> 00:21:41,063
You can watch whales breach,
just right from your palapa.

417
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,122
When are you going?

418
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:45,842
This isn't for me.
This is for Sam

419
00:21:46,236 --> 00:21:47,523
and... Sonya.

420
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:53,312
You're... planning a trip for your
ex-husband and his new girlfriend.

421
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:56,170
You realize how weird that sounds?

422
00:21:57,547 --> 00:21:58,662
Of course I do.

423
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,403
It's ju... look at this place.

424
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:03,613
Somebody should be enjoying it.

425
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,130
Without the surgery, Annie dies.

426
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:11,163
Without the surgery,
Annie has a life,

427
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:12,123
at least for a little while.

428
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:13,881
There are a number
of precedents that deal

429
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,880
with the denial of medical
treatment to children,

430
00:22:15,937 --> 00:22:19,591
but they primarily involve the
religious convictions of the parents.

431
00:22:19,665 --> 00:22:21,362
This isn't a religious thing, judge.

432
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:23,991
It's about giving our little girl
what she really wants.

433
00:22:24,115 --> 00:22:27,582
Look, this is as painful a decision
as anyone can face.

434
00:22:27,705 --> 00:22:29,812
I understand why the Bishops
don't want to make it.

435
00:22:29,935 --> 00:22:32,182
But by giving in to
what their child wants...

436
00:22:32,245 --> 00:22:33,301
And she is a child.

437
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:36,071
They are abdicating
their parental responsibilities.

438
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:37,690
Do I get a say here?

439
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,272
I'm sorry, but you don't.

440
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:41,903
But it's my life.

441
00:22:42,265 --> 00:22:44,563
But legally,
your parents are responsible

442
00:22:44,686 --> 00:22:47,242
for making decisions
about your medical care.

443
00:22:47,455 --> 00:22:49,701
And you should know that state law
prohibits you from acting

444
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:52,290
in any way that endangers
Annie's health.

445
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:54,761
You're going to force them
to make Annie undergo the surgery?

446
00:22:54,817 --> 00:22:55,983
That catheter stays in,

447
00:22:56,048 --> 00:22:59,161
and the surgery is scheduled
for the first available date.

448
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:00,583
That's not fair.

449
00:23:01,028 --> 00:23:02,322
That's not fair!

450
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,552
I haven't seen you in a while.

451
00:23:16,677 --> 00:23:18,751
I lightened my surgical schedule.

452
00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:20,861
I had some personal stuff.

453
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,611
- Finishing or starting?
- Starting. You?

454
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:26,630
Me, too.

455
00:23:30,288 --> 00:23:31,430
I missed you.

456
00:23:32,017 --> 00:23:33,563
I shouldn't say that.

457
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:34,872
But I did...

458
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:37,340
miss you.

459
00:23:38,336 --> 00:23:39,132
Why...

460
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:41,882
- Shouldn't you say that?
- I just...

461
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:45,153
I don't know.

462
00:23:47,846 --> 00:23:50,711
I should go...
back in there before

463
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,473
the baby comes out without me and...

464
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:55,040
I get sued.

465
00:24:02,705 --> 00:24:03,823
Still nothing.

466
00:24:03,947 --> 00:24:05,142
Only his face.

467
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,443
I can't remember anything else.

468
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:09,650
How am I supposed
to testify against him

469
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:11,952
if I can't remember anything
about what happened?

470
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:14,361
The trial is a month away.
You have time.

471
00:24:14,596 --> 00:24:15,611
- You'll remember.
- And then what?

472
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:18,222
I can see what he did to me
again and again?

473
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:22,163
Because right now, all I see is
his face, and I see it everywhere...

474
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:26,933
At the store, on the boy who packs
my groceries, at the gym,

475
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:31,520
every guy in the corridor.
Every time I go anywhere,

476
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:33,190
I see him.

477
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:35,212
And at night,

478
00:24:35,627 --> 00:24:37,263
- in my dreams...
- We can stop.

479
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:41,283
We can work on helping you cope
with where you are today.

480
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:44,080
I want to put him away.

481
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:47,963
I need this fear

482
00:24:48,645 --> 00:24:49,693
to go away.

483
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:53,983
I'm gonna insert the needle now.

484
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:56,873
- You might feel a slight pinch.
- Wait... before you do it,

485
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,873
I just need for you to talk to me

486
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,791
about anything,
just to get my mind off this.

487
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:04,932
Let's see.
We can talk about...

488
00:25:05,058 --> 00:25:07,270
You know, you said
you weren't having sex.

489
00:25:07,396 --> 00:25:08,290
Why not?

490
00:25:08,837 --> 00:25:10,881
You're beautiful, successful...

491
00:25:13,015 --> 00:25:14,880
I'm kind of in between guys
right now.

492
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:17,700
- Anybody you got your eye on?
- There is...

493
00:25:18,547 --> 00:25:20,242
- This one guy.
- Cute?

494
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:21,870
- Very.
- Details.

495
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:26,110
I'm on bed rest and being denied sex.
I need some details.

496
00:25:27,238 --> 00:25:28,480
He's a good guy.

497
00:25:28,606 --> 00:25:32,363
I don't know him that well or anything,
but you can just tell, you know?

498
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:34,133
He's a good guy,

499
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:36,031
and I need a good guy.

500
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:38,403
- Any dates?
- I don't know...

501
00:25:38,527 --> 00:25:39,370
He's...

502
00:25:40,347 --> 00:25:42,692
It's like he wants
to ask me out, but

503
00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:46,371
I don't know. It's like there's
something holding him back or...

504
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,643
Go after him.

505
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:49,070
Get yours.

506
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:52,322
And then tell me all about it.

507
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:56,362
If something happens,
you will be the first to know.

508
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:06,613
I hear the waves are 2 to 4 feet,
great shape.

509
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:12,790
One of the guys in the office surfs.
Said it was great out there today.

510
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:13,713
Maybe.

511
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:15,400
I don't know.

512
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:18,051
Can't see it from here.

513
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:19,332
I know.

514
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:20,720
I'm sorry.

515
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:26,631
When I thought that one day,
I could be out there doing it myself,

516
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:28,550
it was fun to think about.

517
00:26:29,085 --> 00:26:30,121
But now...

518
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:33,503
- Come on, Annie.
- We both know the truth.

519
00:26:34,547 --> 00:26:36,592
I'm gonna die in this hospital.

520
00:26:41,056 --> 00:26:42,681
You sign off on the junction

521
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:44,811
Now you're telling me you just want me
to let her die?

522
00:26:44,845 --> 00:26:47,021
I was doing my job.
I was following the law.

523
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,641
- But?
- Maybe Cooper's right.

524
00:26:48,696 --> 00:26:50,890
Keeping her alive isn't the same
as saving her life.

525
00:26:51,015 --> 00:26:54,302
I am sorry Annie can't go to school
or go surfing,

526
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:56,463
but is the chance to do that
for a month or two,

527
00:26:56,585 --> 00:26:59,172
is that worth giving up the chance
at living past 13?

528
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:01,330
She's got nothing left in her,

529
00:27:01,457 --> 00:27:04,892
not even the will to fight you.
So maybe you should ask yourself,

530
00:27:05,276 --> 00:27:07,010
who are you doing this for?

531
00:27:10,655 --> 00:27:12,562
She still hasn't done the amnio.

532
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:16,401
Maybe you should just do that
charm thing you people do.

533
00:27:17,096 --> 00:27:18,390
You're charming.

534
00:27:22,145 --> 00:27:23,392
I'm thinking about it.

535
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:26,152
In psychological circles,
we call that a stall.

536
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:30,150
Jill had a very tough session today.
I was wondering if you could

537
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:32,100
do something to help her relax.

538
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:43,533
Don't touch me!

539
00:27:46,777 --> 00:27:48,292
It's me. It's Pete.

540
00:27:48,688 --> 00:27:50,663
Focus on me. Look at me.
It's Pete.

541
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:55,250
Take a deep breath.

542
00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:57,122
You're here. You're okay.

543
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,362
She's resting.

544
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:09,620
Thanks.

545
00:28:10,537 --> 00:28:11,800
You have to stop.

546
00:28:11,995 --> 00:28:14,303
- She's traumatized.
- By the attack.

547
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:16,791
She... is afraid that if she doesn't
finish what she started,

548
00:28:16,915 --> 00:28:19,622
then this thing will keep haunting her.
So I'm... gonna support her in that.

549
00:28:19,748 --> 00:28:20,793
Jill is a wreck.

550
00:28:20,918 --> 00:28:23,171
- She's falling apart.
- She was happy.

551
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:24,430
She had a life.

552
00:28:24,557 --> 00:28:26,710
He came in and...
took a piece of it away...

553
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:28,832
Her contentment, her security.

554
00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:30,942
And until she sees this guy

555
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:34,861
locked up and paying for what he did,
she's not gonna move past it.

556
00:28:34,985 --> 00:28:36,482
I hope you're right.

557
00:28:48,946 --> 00:28:50,293
You're here late.

558
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:53,412
You know, babies don't tell time.

559
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,573
Besides, you're... here, too.

560
00:28:58,466 --> 00:29:00,011
Do you think we push?

561
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:03,871
As... doctors,
do you think we push too hard?

562
00:29:07,975 --> 00:29:09,671
I don't know.
I mean...

563
00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:14,212
I have this patient now.
She's pregnant and just...

564
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:18,332
Just trying to get her through
it so she can have a healthy baby,

565
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:19,303
I push,

566
00:29:19,806 --> 00:29:22,850
you know, for patients like her,
because she needs me to.

567
00:29:22,975 --> 00:29:25,092
What about when they
don't need you to?

568
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:26,361
Are you okay?

569
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:30,820
I think i've been pushing too hard.

570
00:29:31,158 --> 00:29:32,300
I don't know.

571
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:42,862
Just sit here with me?

572
00:29:51,495 --> 00:29:54,573
Do you realize that we don't even know
each other's names?

573
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:00,772
You're right.

574
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:03,540
I'm Addison Montgomery.

575
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:09,673
I have to...
I have to go.

576
00:30:09,796 --> 00:30:11,140
I have a patient.

577
00:30:20,157 --> 00:30:21,502
Nice to meet you.

578
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,501
Betsey's sick.
Her school just called.

579
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:30,241
Do you mind if i duck out for, like,
an hour? Heather can't get her.

580
00:30:30,418 --> 00:30:32,633
- That's fine. Go ahead.
- What are you doing?

581
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:35,081
Doesn't this trip look perfect?

582
00:30:35,577 --> 00:30:36,473
For who?

583
00:30:36,845 --> 00:30:38,623
You do see what you're doing?

584
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:41,170
- I am helping.
- You're avoiding.

585
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:45,993
Archer broke your heart.

586
00:30:46,117 --> 00:30:48,702
And now you're throwing yourself
into Sam's life

587
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:51,621
so you don't have to pick up
and start yours.

588
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:53,672
Don't take this the wrong way,

589
00:30:53,795 --> 00:30:56,421
but when was the last time
you went on a date?

590
00:30:58,377 --> 00:31:00,323
- Come on.
- Maybe if you...

591
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:05,732
spent all this time and effort you're
spending on Sam and Sonya on yourself...

592
00:31:07,338 --> 00:31:09,183
It might be more rewarding.

593
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:25,671
You here to force another
procedure on her or...

594
00:31:26,947 --> 00:31:29,093
I won't push the surgery anymore.

595
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:31,682
If she doesn't want it,
I won't push.

596
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:35,500
- What about the judge?
- I told him I reevaluated my position.

597
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,902
I just wanted to help her.

598
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:45,382
So once it's out?

599
00:31:45,977 --> 00:31:47,813
It's not easy to get back in.

600
00:31:47,937 --> 00:31:49,482
If Annie were to have a problem?

601
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:52,271
We might not be able to get
medication into her fast enough.

602
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:53,740
You do understand?

603
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,040
This is it.

604
00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:56,833
You sure?

605
00:31:57,617 --> 00:31:58,562
I'm sure.

606
00:31:59,465 --> 00:32:00,623
It's all right, mom.

607
00:32:00,797 --> 00:32:03,871
I promise, it's all right.
Everything's gonna be okay.

608
00:32:04,168 --> 00:32:05,212
You'll see.

609
00:32:15,415 --> 00:32:18,763
- I'm gonna see the ocean.
- You're gonna see the ocean.

610
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,970
Good news.

611
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:35,521
Amnio was normal.
There are no genetic abnormalities.

612
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:37,470
The baby is perfectly healthy.

613
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:41,101
I can't wait to tell my husband.

614
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:43,172
He should be here any minute.

615
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:45,000
There he is.

616
00:32:47,985 --> 00:32:51,882
This is the wonderful doctor
I've been telling you so much about...

617
00:32:52,576 --> 00:32:54,682
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

618
00:32:59,526 --> 00:33:01,073
You're gonna do fine.

619
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,312
I don't know if I can do this.

620
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:09,832
I know that you're scared,

621
00:33:09,885 --> 00:33:12,100
but I also know that this is something
that you want to do.

622
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:13,172
What if I can't?

623
00:33:15,766 --> 00:33:16,742
Look at him.

624
00:33:17,335 --> 00:33:18,430
Look at him.

625
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:23,431
Tell me what he did to you.

626
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,163
I heard his voice...

627
00:33:26,687 --> 00:33:28,752
Telling me not to turn around and...

628
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:32,060
Keep breathing,
just like we worked on.

629
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:38,562
He had a gun.

630
00:33:38,858 --> 00:33:40,153
He grabbed me...

631
00:33:40,716 --> 00:33:43,743
And the next thing I knew,
I felt a blow across my face.

632
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,972
And then he hit me with the gun over

633
00:33:46,095 --> 00:33:46,992
and over

634
00:33:47,418 --> 00:33:50,383
and over, until my head slammed
into the pavement.

635
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:53,322
That's right.
That's what he did to you.

636
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,112
- Now why are you here?
- That man robbed me.

637
00:33:57,126 --> 00:33:59,653
He didn't just steal my car
and my money.

638
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:02,412
He stole my sense of security.

639
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:04,643
He stole my ability
to sleep at night.

640
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:06,960
He stole my sense of self-control.

641
00:34:07,728 --> 00:34:09,373
So I came here today...

642
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,601
To get them back.

643
00:34:13,507 --> 00:34:15,052
I'd say you're ready.

644
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:23,853
You should've seen the smile
on her face when she got on that board.

645
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:26,700
It's her birthday,

646
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:30,142
and it just keeps
creeping up on me...

647
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,311
That it'll be her last.

648
00:34:33,707 --> 00:34:35,003
It's a good one.

649
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,151
It's... what she wanted.
She's living.

650
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:42,793
...going over, and I was freaking out.
I was so scared.

651
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:45,241
And I was, like,
just hold on to the board...

652
00:34:47,507 --> 00:34:50,800
I should've trusted you to know
what Jill could handle,

653
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:53,603
to know that she'd remember
when she was ready.

654
00:34:55,245 --> 00:34:56,793
You wanted to see me?

655
00:34:57,478 --> 00:34:59,901
- Both of you.
- Wait... Did...

656
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:01,950
Did you...

657
00:35:03,397 --> 00:35:04,342
I didn't.

658
00:35:06,018 --> 00:35:08,943
Right now, in my mind,
the baby is...

659
00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:11,682
is the bug.
And...

660
00:35:12,495 --> 00:35:15,243
I've gotten used to the bug.
I'm actually...

661
00:35:16,368 --> 00:35:17,611
Liking the bug.

662
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:21,211
And I'm afraid if I start
seeing it with a

663
00:35:21,547 --> 00:35:22,922
Pete head or a

664
00:35:23,478 --> 00:35:24,890
Sheldon head or...

665
00:35:25,525 --> 00:35:28,871
I know myself, and I know that
I'm not ready to do this.

666
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,482
- What about us?
- If you want to know anything, ask.

667
00:35:32,608 --> 00:35:34,701
If you want to be included, come...

668
00:35:34,826 --> 00:35:36,672
both of you.
Or neither of you.

669
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:40,092
I understand if you want
to walk away, and I'm sorry.

670
00:35:40,216 --> 00:35:42,571
But I know that this is
the best way to do it.

671
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:43,680
For you.

672
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:52,252
You're alone here.

673
00:35:53,426 --> 00:35:54,421
You have...

674
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,270
and the baby.

675
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:01,570
But you're all alone.

676
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:04,532
And you don't have to be.

677
00:36:14,217 --> 00:36:15,713
Cat got your tongue?

678
00:36:19,285 --> 00:36:20,981
I do not understand you.

679
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:23,560
What?

680
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:27,470
I just bumped into him.
You went to Noah behind my back.

681
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:30,842
Why didn't you tell me you helped
him change his mind?

682
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:34,811
You did a good thing, a thing
that makes me love you even more.

683
00:36:34,937 --> 00:36:37,381
I don't need you
to love me even more!

684
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:40,603
I slept with Archer,

685
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:42,063
and you forgive me.

686
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,461
You are good.
You are the good one.

687
00:36:44,588 --> 00:36:46,632
You do good things.
You and...

688
00:36:48,348 --> 00:36:49,692
It makes me sick.

689
00:36:50,027 --> 00:36:54,272
You lovin' me, it makes me
literally sick to my stomach.

690
00:36:55,276 --> 00:36:56,913
I slept with somebody else.

691
00:36:57,035 --> 00:37:00,080
I screwed Archer's brains out,
and you forgive it?

692
00:37:00,327 --> 00:37:01,521
Who does that?

693
00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:03,582
So, see, you're the good one,

694
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,301
and I'm the bad one,

695
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:09,833
and I don't want credit for saving
a little girl's life. I don't want it.

696
00:37:10,048 --> 00:37:12,591
- You need to forgive yourself.
- Damn it, stop loving me.

697
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:15,173
- You need to forgive yourself.
- Just stop loving me!

698
00:37:15,297 --> 00:37:16,941
I will not stop loving you.

699
00:37:24,695 --> 00:37:25,571
I'm sorry.

700
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:32,871
Look at this. Sonya and I got to make
our own private label.

701
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:35,802
- Now that's what I call a vacation.
- Thanks.

702
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:39,390
So what do you think
I should do next with sonya?

703
00:37:40,017 --> 00:37:41,970
What's the... what's the plan?

704
00:37:42,957 --> 00:37:44,772
You... know, there is no plan.

705
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,073
Travel agency's closed.
I'm finished.

706
00:37:47,196 --> 00:37:49,643
What? You were helping me out.
It was fun.

707
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:51,363
That's the problem.

708
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:58,243
You shouldn't be having fun with me.
You should be having fun with her.

709
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:02,860
I should be having some fun
of my own.

710
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:17,791
Annie's 13.

711
00:38:21,348 --> 00:38:22,290
Good job.

712
00:38:25,497 --> 00:38:27,292
The jury found him guilty.

713
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:29,961
Very good job.

714
00:38:38,006 --> 00:38:39,752
Will you talk to the bug?

715
00:38:41,808 --> 00:38:43,551
I thought you hated that.

716
00:38:45,716 --> 00:38:47,260
Just talk to the bug.

717
00:38:55,147 --> 00:38:58,450
This is your uncle Cooper speaking.
And I look forward to seeing you

718
00:38:58,577 --> 00:39:00,352
in a couple of months.

719
00:39:02,235 --> 00:39:05,340
Ready to go?
I got us a 7:30 reservation...

720
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:07,251
What's wrong?

721
00:39:09,128 --> 00:39:12,272
You don't call out your
ex-wife's name out of habit,

722
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:14,973
not if it's working...

723
00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:17,932
Not if it's right.

724
00:39:18,937 --> 00:39:19,880
Do you...

725
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:22,921
Do you want to be with her?

726
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:28,123
What she and I had...

727
00:39:29,787 --> 00:39:31,080
a best friend...

728
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:33,481
and you and I...

729
00:39:37,968 --> 00:39:40,331
- We're never gonna get there.
- I'm sorry.

730
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:43,861
Me, too.

731
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:53,763
- This is a mistake.
- Just... be here.

732
00:39:56,308 --> 00:39:58,150
But still, it is a mistake.

733
00:40:01,438 --> 00:40:02,830
I'll be over here.

734
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:15,353
- I wasn't going to come.
- But you did.

735
00:40:15,868 --> 00:40:16,860
Thank you.

736
00:40:18,097 --> 00:40:19,441
What do you want?

737
00:40:21,815 --> 00:40:23,610
I just... wanted to say...

738
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:27,940
I just wanted to tell you

739
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:31,911
that the first time we talked,
I was just a flattered married guy.

740
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,680
Then the second time,

741
00:40:34,218 --> 00:40:36,142
I was... playing with fire.

742
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,353
And then...

743
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:39,823
I got attached.

744
00:40:41,078 --> 00:40:43,623
I got attached in a way
I didn't expect.

745
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:48,442
- I didn't mean to, I didn't plan...
- I have been where you are...

746
00:40:49,578 --> 00:40:51,773
One step away from doing something

747
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:53,510
really stupid.

748
00:40:54,688 --> 00:40:56,582
I've done...
really stupid.

749
00:40:58,406 --> 00:40:59,903
Don't take the step.

750
00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:08,902
What if I want to take the step?

751
00:41:11,835 --> 00:41:14,630
What if the step is...
all I can think about?

752
00:41:16,705 --> 00:41:19,750
- She's my patient.
- You think I don't know that?

753
00:41:26,156 --> 00:41:27,750
Finishing or starting?

754
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:34,102
Finishing.

755
00:41:42,506 --> 00:41:44,901
