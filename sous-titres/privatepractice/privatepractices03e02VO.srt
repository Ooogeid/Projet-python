1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,390
Keep doing the exercises

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,050
and take three of the supplements a day.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,820
It really should help your back.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,730
Yeah, I'm gonna be back in the office today.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,160
Okay, great. Bye.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,100
You're going back to work?
Well, we talked about this.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,100
It's been a month. You said you were ready. But if... 
oh, no, no. Right, right.

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,340
You're right. You're right.
You should go back to work.

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,710
Hey, I put down the new rug.
Oh, good.

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,810
Do you like it? 'Cause I can get something else.
It's fine.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,250
I just didn't know if you'd like it.
It's fine. It's fine. It's for covering blood.

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,180
It doesn't have to match the drapes.

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,890
You want to hold him?

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,560
He's fed, changed and burped... happy.

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,360
It's the perfect time.

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,400
Well, you... you've got him.

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,230
Violet... 

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,270
Okay, breathe in and out.

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,570
Shh, shh, shh. Remember what we said?

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,570
This time, you're just gonna breathe in and out.

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,510
You're just gonna stand there and wait. Shh.
I can't. I can't. I can't.

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,610
No... yes, you're just gonna
stand there and wait

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,480
until I open the door.

24
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,480
Breathe in and out. Do not go in... 

25
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,780
The closet.

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,490
I told you, don't ring the bell.

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,130
Oh, oh. Did I wake him?

28
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,260
No.

29
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,360
She's in the closet again.

30
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,730
Don't worry. I'm handling it.
Yeah, no, no. I can... 
I can see that.

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,140
Look, this really isn't a good time.
Could I at least say hello
to Violet and the baby?

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,470
You know, since I might be his father.

33
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,840
I'm sorry, but this really isn't a good time.

34
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,310
Well... 

35
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,110
That was Sheldon.

36
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,490
The rug is stained.

37
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,790
Well, better coffee than blood, huh?

38
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,760
You know what?

39
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,090
I'm not gonna go back to work yet.

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,760
You're not ready.
You're looking at me
like I have crazy head.

41
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,100
And I don't. I don't have crazy head. I'm fine.

42
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,870
Go back to work.
You haven't been out of the house.

43
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,040
You don't answer the door.
I'm... I'm fine.

44
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,240
You never want to hold the baby.

45
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,550
Well, give me the baby.

46
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,380
Pete, give me the baby.

47
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,690
All right, Pete, you... you... 

48
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,630
you are understandably concerned

49
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,300
because you're not sure
of what's going on,

50
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,330
so I'm gonna explain it to you.

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,670
I am suffering from panic
attacks, sleeplessness,

52
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,270
agoraphobia and fear... all within
the windows of behavior

53
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,070
one expects from trauma victims.

54
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,080
However I... I'm not cognitively altered,

55
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,480
I am not utilizing unhealthy
outlets for my feelings,

56
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,410
such as drugs or inappropriate behaviors.

57
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,420
I am aware of my condition

58
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,050
and feel a normal amount
of concern for my well-being.

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,790
I display few signs
of improvement,

60
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,090
but... but I also display
no signs of dintegration.

61
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,690
I have the number of two therapists,

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,190
the housekeeper is coming by,

63
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,600
and the baby can fit
in the closet with me.

64
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,730
More importantly,

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,770
I am a Harvard-educated medical profsional

66
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,700
with 14 years of clinical experience

67
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,200
of trauma and depression.

68
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,840
So believe me when I am telling you

69
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,380
that I do not have crazy head.

70
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,880
Now I'm holding the baby.
Go to work. We'll be fine.

71
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,980
Watch out...

72
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,860
Morning.

73
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,730
Morning.

74
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,700
Good shoes.

75
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,970
Thanks.

76
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,600
Yours, too.

77
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,840
Oh, can you...
Oh, yeah, yeah.

78
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,210
Press 4? Thanks. How's it going there?

79
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,710
It's great.

80
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,580
It's really great. I redecorated.

81
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,420
Oh. Good.

82
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,390
How's it going up there?

83
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,050
Fine.
Yeah?

84
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,960
Hey, what ever happened with that guy?
What guy?

85
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,690
The... the heart guy.
The one you really liked,

86
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,660
but he was married and
his wife was your patient.

87
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,630
What was his name?
Noah.

88
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,200
Yeah, Noah. Noah. What happened?

89
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,630
You never told me.

90
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,940
Nothing. I, uh, did the right thing.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,710
Good. That's... that's good.

92
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,640
Okay. Well...

93
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,810
I'll see you later.

94
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,290
Because, Sam, it is time.

95
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,850
Time for what?
Cooper thinks we should
hire a new doctor.

96
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,690
I think it's time we move on.
I just don't want to rush into anything.

97
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,460
When we find...  if we find someone,

98
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:45,461
I want it to be the right person.

99
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,700
Addison, explain to the man that
married his college sweetheart

100
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,530
that the best way to get over
a breakup is to move fast,

101
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,670
throw yourself into a relationship.

102
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,640
I mean, drunken, impulsive rebound hiring.

103
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,140
Naomi is gone, man. You gotta let it go.

104
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,240
What is wrong with you two?

105
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,310
What?
We made a pact.

106
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,250
Addison and I are ignoring our
problems. We are not going to talk

107
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,780
or think about our problems anymore.

108
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,690
Nothing even closethinking
or talking about our problems.

109
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,820
We're gonna be strong.
Strong.

110
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,820
In denial, but strong.
Strong.

111
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,290
Yeah, well, that's, um, you know... stupid.

112
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,800
You need to talk about stuff.
Really?

113
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,830
Mm-hmm.
Okay, well, how's Violet, Coop?

114
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,070
Good. She's good.
Is she?

115
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,040
Uh-huh.
Leave me alone.

116
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,670
I've sent stuff. I've sent brownies and flowers

117
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,610
and some very thoughtfully worded e-mails.

118
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,580
I will get to Violet's.
I'm giving her some space.

119
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,850
Oh, okay, you know what?
I gotta get to the E.R.

120
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,810
You two don't talk about me
while I'm gone, okay?

121
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,850
It's rude.

122
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,490
Oh, you waited for me.

123
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,290
I like dating the chief of staff.

124
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,300
I get special service.
What do you got for me?

125
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,200
One of my patients put
a marble in his nose?
Not exactly.

126
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,070
11 year old's dad threw
her across the room,

127
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,040
probably broke her arm.

128
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,040
Mom looked like she was in a prizefight.

129
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,010
Dad won the first round,
but mom threw the knockout.

130
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,150
Fun times. Wait a minute.
The Larsens? My Larsens?

131
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,010
Tammy and her parents?

132
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,420
Page Sam... and Addison.
Michelle's pregnant.

133
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,890
Dad?

134
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,260
I stabbed him.

135
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,900
I stabbed my husband.

137
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,970
We're gonna get you in a cast later.

138
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,980
You can have everybody sign it.

139
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,280
You're just gonna have to be prepared

140
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,250
for a little bit of itching, okay?

141
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,680
All right. You want to talk about it?

142
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,850
No. I can't.

143
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,220
All right. Okay.

144
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,190
I know it feels that way,

145
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,190
but, um, you gotta believe me.

146
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,730
There's a lot of people
that want to help you.

147
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,830
Okay. Well, maybe later. All right?

148
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,830
You still playing soccer?

149
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,540
Yeah. Starting fullback.

150
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,440
Oh, yeah? Starting fullback. That's, uh...

151
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,280
Yeah, see, I don't know
anything about soccer.

152
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,650
You could ask me about basketball.

153
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,810
I'm good with the basketball.
Invented by a doctor,

154
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,580
probably to get more patients,

155
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,550
'cause, you know, basketball injuries.

156
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,990
Is my dad gonna be okay?

157
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,960
Dr. Bennett's taking care
of him. He's in good hands.

158
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,660
Okay, so crits are stable.
Fast scan is negative.

159
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,630
He's got some bruising behind his left ear,

160
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,630
so we'll also need a head C.T.

161
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,930
Thanks, man.

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,730
Sam...
It looks okay?

163
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,200
Uh, you've got a stab wound to your abdomen.

164
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,670
If you ask me, you're lucky that's all you got.

165
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,940
What about Tammy and... and Michelle?

166
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,440
Is the baby okay?

167
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,410
Oh, so you're worried about them now?

168
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,420
A little bit late for that, don't you think?

169
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,350
So he says, "she's not dead. She's just

170
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,790
electroencephalographically challenged."

171
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,060
So it looks like everybody is settling in.

172
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,630
Yes. Thank you, Dr. Bennett.

173
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,100
It's good to be here.

174
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,060
Okay. Well, if you, uh, need anything,

175
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,970
just let me know.

176
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,500
My door is always open.

177
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,600
Interesting dynamic.

178
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,770
Even a group of top-notch,
einstein-type professionals

179
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,740
feel the urge to get out of the room

180
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,240
when the boss comes in.

181
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,210
Oh, well... they'll warm up

182
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,020
once we all get to know each other.
Yeah.

183
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,090
So have you had the chance
to see Violet and Luke?

184
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,990
Pete's been telling me
it's a bad time, politely,

185
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,820
as he blocks the door
and refuses to let me pass.

186
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,830
H... has he said anything to you?

187
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,830
Um, they're... kinda
not talking to me up there.

188
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,800
But, uh, Addison and I actually had

189
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,730
a real conversation this morning,

190
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,770
so hopefully things will
get back to normal soon.

191
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,270
What?

192
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,780
Nothing, nothing.

193
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,740
It's just... well, another interesting dynamic.

194
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,680
You being my new boss,
I'm hesitant to point out

195
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,650
that it... it might not be that easy.

196
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,320
Heartbeat looks normal for 10 weeks.

197
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,290
No evidence of bleeding from the trauma.

198
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,660
So the baby's okay?

199
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,600
Looks fine.

200
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,660
Michelle, does this kind
of thing happen often,

201
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,470
Darren hitting Tammy,

202
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,470
hitting you?

203
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,740
It was an accident.

204
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,740
I want to see my daughter.

205
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,380
Michelle, look, I know
this is hard to talk about,

206
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,210
but you stabbed your husband.

207
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Now if you were protecting Tammy,

208
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,980
if this was self-defen... 
God, you're making us sound like...

209
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,790
It was not like that. Darren didn't do anything.
You don't have to make excuses.

210
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,690
I was cooking...

211
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,660
and Darren and I started arguing.

212
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,830
Tammy tried to stop us,

213
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,760
and she got in the way,
and Darren pushed her.

214
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,570
It was an accident, but I got mad

215
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,340
and I overreacted and
I had a knife in my hand.

216
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,770
Please. I need to be with Tammy.
I need to make sure she's okay.
Okay, okay.

217
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,180
Michelle Larsen. We have
a warrant for your arrest.

218
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,750
What? No, no. No, officer.
Her husband hit her.

219
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,420
It was an accident.

220
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,190
Okay, Michelle. No, look, she
has a daughter who needs her.

221
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,320
She's pregnant. She has a head contusion.

222
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,120
She needs medical care.
Then admit her upstairs
to the medical jail ward,

223
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,690
but her husband has a knife
wound, and she's under arrest.
Mom?

224
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,930
Do not handcuff her in front of her daughter.
What is happening?

225
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,660
Tammy, it's okay. She's traumatized enough.
Cooper, get her out of here.

226
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,770
No! I want to stay with mom!
No, no, no. Tammy, Tammy... 

227
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,000
Everything's okay, sweetie.
I love you. Mom!

228
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,100
I love you, sweetie.
I love you. Tammy.

229
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,320
You want me to give up a hospital
bed for a kid with a broken arm?

230
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,675
She's 11 years old, her dad hit her,

231
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:37,681
she just watched her mom
get hauled off by the cops.

232
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:38,650
All good material for a country song,

233
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,790
but lousy on a medical report.

234
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,760
You look like day-old dishwater, Coop.

235
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,130
Why don't you go grab a shower, get some rest?

236
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,160
You've done all you can here.
No, she's my patient,

237
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,130
and I should've known what was going on.

238
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,930
I could've stopped this.
When are you going to
Violet's to get your stuff?

239
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,940
Oh, Charlotte, come on.
Have you talked to her?

240
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,070
This is not about Violet, okay?

241
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,840
I haven't shaved and my shirt's a little wrinkled,

242
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,810
but beneath the depressed hobo look, I am fine.
You're fine? You haven't seen
Violet since she got home.

243
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,810
You live with her for six months,

244
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,920
now you won't even pick up a clean shirt?

245
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,750
You won't talk about it.
Like you talk about you getting fired?

246
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,060
I'm doing my job, Cooper... 
the one I have left.

247
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,830
My problems aren't getting in the way of that.
I have a patient.

248
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,030
Echo is now a grand old matriarch,

249
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,040
her crossed tusks make her unmistakable.

250
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,210
Hello.
Violet, you're there.

251
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,980
Yeah. Well, that's how
the telephone works.

252
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,980
You call people.
They answer. You speak.

253
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,850
Right. Uh, look, I was just
calling to remind you

254
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,290
that if Lucas can't sleep,
give him the sheep toy.

255
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,690
And he likes the rain sound,
but not the whale calls.

256
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,030
Uh, well, nobody likes the whale calls. They're eerie.
You're checking up on me.

257
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,360
Yeah. I was hoping you'd be out.

258
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,070
Well, Lucas is sleeping
now, so, uh, I better go.

259
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,840
You know what they say... 
sleep while the baby sleeps.

260
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,810
The Larsens? My Larsens?

261
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,880
Yeah. Well, my Larsens now.

262
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,080
Well, when Michelle came to me,

263
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,720
she and Darren wanted a
sibling so badly for Tammy.

264
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,690
When they finally got pregnant, they seemed so... 
So happy, I know.

265
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,690
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for
coming with me today.

266
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,230
Yeah, well, you know,
I wanted to see Violet,

267
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,200
and this gives us a chance to hang out.
Yeah.

268
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,200
Yeah. Things have been
a little awkward, you know?

269
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,200
Well, no.

270
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,300
It's just, uh...

271
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,240
It's nice to see you... outside of the office.

272
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,570
Yeah.

273
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,480
Yeah.

274
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,380
No. Mnh-mnh.

275
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,620
Apparently... there's a closet situation.

276
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,120
Violet. Hey, it's me.

277
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,190
Uh, Nai and I are outside.

278
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,430
Okay.

279
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,230
Hello?

280
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,600
Vi?

281
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,810
Could you... could you shut
the front door, please?

282
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,710
And... and lock it.

283
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,640
Both locks.

284
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,280
It's closed and locked.
Okay.

285
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,090
Hey, you guys.

286
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,090
Hi.

287
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,590
It's so good to see you. Hi.

288
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,120
Oh. Oh, my God, you brought food. You're gods.

289
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,490
Hi.
Hi.

290
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,660
Oh...

291
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,300
my God.

292
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,100
Hi.

293
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,310
Oh, look at these tiny hands. Hi.

294
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,710
Oh, baby smell. I love baby smell.

295
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,150
It's like heroin.

296
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,520
Aww. Yes. This is making my uterus hurt.

297
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,020
Oh.
Hello, sweetie.

298
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,620
Oh.
Hi.

299
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,790
Yeah.

300
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,790
He's adorable.

301
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,960
Yeah.

302
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,690
Hi, sweetie.

303
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,660
I get that you think I'm a monster.

304
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,770
But the thing is, I swear, Sam, it was an accident.

305
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,700
You get medical care from me.
You don't get sympathy.

306
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,510
I'm not looking for your
sympathy. I feel terrible.

307
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,870
It's not that. I'm a good man.

308
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,480
Stop talking.

309
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,810
You're a good man?

310
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,820
You like to hit women.
You like to hit children.

311
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,820
That doesn't make you good

312
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,820
and it sure as hell doesn't make
you a man, so stop talking.

313
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,820
Okay, I'm... I'm a good man.

314
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,830
And if you say one more word,
I might have to show you

315
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,560
what this good man does to people like you.

316
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,400
Dr. Bennett, you might want to rein in

317
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,670
that charming bedside manner.

318
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,210
Trust me, I was reining it in.

319
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,740
He's seizing.

320
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,010
Darren?

321
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,380
I need suction and an airway now.

322
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,860
Your incision is healing well.

323
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,200
Just keep the area, you know, clean and dry.
Okay.

324
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,400
Anything else?

325
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,370
No. Yes. Um...

326
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,710
you should probably get some light exercise.

327
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,180
Just go walk around
the block or something.

328
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,610
You know, just get out.

329
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,250
Wow.

330
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,020
Your... your lips are moving,

331
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,890
but your words sound just like Pete's.

332
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,760
You were in the closet, Violet.

333
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,730
Look, I'm...

334
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,090
I'm doing the best I can.

335
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,530
No, I know you are. I do.
Oh, look at that smile.

336
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,730
That's gas.

337
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,240
Sorry to tell you.

338
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,140
No, it is not gas. This is a smile.

339
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,780
Yes, it is, 'cause you love
your auntie Nai, don't you?

340
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,180
Oh.

341
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,380
Oh, isn't he beautiful?

342
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,220
When Maya was little, I used
to just watch her breathe.

343
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,180
Isn't this the best?
Sure.

344
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,350
I am hogging the baby.
I'm sorry. Who wants him?

345
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,890
It's Addison's turn.

346
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,560
Oh, go, go, go.
Yes.

347
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,920
But you're coming back to me.
Hello, Lucas.

348
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,690
He did just smile.

349
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,000
He smiled.

350
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,610
Wow, this place looks different.

351
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,210
Pete... I'm surprised to see you here.

352
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,140
Unless you're my 2:15 appointment,

353
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,640
in which case,

354
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,810
I'm glad you're finally dealing
with your kleptomania.

355
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,120
Well, that's funny. You're a funny guy.

356
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,450
Look, I need to talk to you about Violet.

357
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,590
Are you sure this is a good time?

358
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,590
Okay, I've been a little overprotective.

359
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,860
You mean territorial.
Whatever psychological term
you want to use is fine.

360
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,360
I'm not here to argue with you.
I told you when you brought her home

361
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,830
from the hospital to her
home, that was a mistake.

362
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,800
She wasn't ready to face the trauma.
Going back to that house
is what Violet wanted.

363
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,800
You try telling her what to do.

364
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,700
I'd like to, but I haven't had
the chance. You're handling it.

365
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,810
I need your help.

366
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,510
I'll stop by this afternoon.

367
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,650
Thank you. I was eyeing that apple.

368
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,360
The pressure in his brain
is still not coming down.

369
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,030
Continue the mannitol

370
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,030
and hyperventilate him to a P.C.0.2 of 35.

371
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,070
Hey. What happened?

372
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,040
Cerebral contusion.
He wouldn't stop seizing.

373
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,180
I had to induce a barbiturate coma.

374
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,910
Neuro put a pressure monitor in,

375
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,880
but I can't get the pressure to come down.

376
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,380
So he may die?

377
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,280
Yeah. Little bit of justice. I'm just saying.

378
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,290
Sam, if he dies...

379
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,090
Michelle could be charged with murder.

380
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,090
And what, Tammy has a father who's dead

381
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,130
and a mother in jail?

382
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,060
All right, well, now you're
just making me feel bad,

383
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,300
so stop it.

384
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,330
Michelle, if you don't tell the truth now,

385
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,770
you'll go to jail.

386
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,710
I am.
I just don't buy it.

387
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,870
You're still trying to protect some image

388
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,340
that you have of your family or of Darren.

389
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,910
It wasn't an accident,

390
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,910
and if he dies,

391
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,450
you will be charged with
manslaughter or worse.

392
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,450
You have to stop protecting him,

393
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,150
if not for yourself,
then for your daughter.

394
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,560
Think about Tammy.
I am.

395
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,160
I am thinking about my daughter.

396
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,830
Tammy, we have some hard stuff...

397
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,700
to talk about.

398
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,940
Your dad is in a coma.

399
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,110
From being stabbed?
He hit his head.

400
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,410
And Dr. Bennett's taking care of him.

401
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,340
We're doing everything that we can.

402
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,350
Look, I know this is really hard

403
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,120
and I know you don't want to talk about it,

404
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,150
and believe me, I know what that's like.

405
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,450
But your mom's in trouble with the police,

406
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,020
and I don't want her to be in more trouble.

407
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,060
And this should not be your responsibility,

408
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,660
but she says that it's all her fault,

409
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,630
what happened, and...

410
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,630
well, I don't believe her.

411
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,600
And... if you told the police
what really happened...

412
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,510
well...

413
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,840
I'm supposed to say it was an accident.

414
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,110
But it wasn't?

415
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,420
No.

416
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,450
No.

417
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,890
Tammy, look, whatever your dad did... 

418
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,690
it wasn't him.

419
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,030
I was cutting a cantaloupe,
and my dad came in.

420
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,230
He started singing with the radio.

421
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,730
He was being funny,

422
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,260
but I got so mad.

423
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,370
I don't know. It just cos over me.

424
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,370
My dad could see it was happening.

425
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,570
He held me to calm me down, but I bit him.

426
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,570
And he yelled for my mom,

427
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,110
and they both tried to stop me.

428
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,380
I had the knife in my hand, so I stabbed him.

429
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,220
And now he's gonna die.

430
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,880
I see you have a new rug.

431
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,220
Pete tells me you're afraid to leave the house.

432
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,360
I said that you could come see the baby,

433
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,630
not shrink my brain.
Your body language is telling me
that you're uncomfortable.

434
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,100
My vocal language is telling you that I'm fine.

435
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,600
Really. Could you be deflecting right now?

436
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:14,140
Not very effectively.

437
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,100
What do you want me to say, Sheldon?

438
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,610
I want you to talk about how you're feeling.

439
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,080
Do you want to hold the baby or not?

440
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,850
Yes.

441
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,050
I know what you're doing,
Violet. It's not gonna work.

442
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,880
I'm not doing ything.

443
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,850
Look at this guy.

444
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,460
Do you mind watching him?

445
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,230
I could really use a shower.

446
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,470
It's not gonna work, Violet.

447
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,370
I'm a professional psychiatrist.

448
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,600
You're not gonna confuse me with a baby.

449
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,710
And I think you have my ears.

450
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,440
I'm sorry about that.

451
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,640
Yeah, I am.

452
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,010
No. No, no. She told you?
No, no, she can't take

453
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,480
the blame for this, please.
Can you give us a moment,
please? Thank you.

454
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,590
No, what are they gonna do to her?
They're gonna try to get her some help.

455
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,320
Don't you think we've tried?
Michelle, I understand the urge to lie,

456
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,260
to protect your family,
but we couldn't let you say

457
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,200
that it was your fault when it wasn't.
But it is. It is my fault.

458
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,360
I was on drugs when I was pregnant with her,

459
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,300
for the first couple of months,

460
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,440
before I knew I was carrying her.
Michelle... 

461
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,870
You weren't there. You don't know, but I know.

462
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,170
She had H.D.H.D. because of what I did,

463
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,040
and then these rages started.

464
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,040
She has them over nothing.

465
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,050
And someone told you that her behavior

466
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,250
was related to your drug use?

467
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,250
The school counselor said
that it's adolescence,

468
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,550
but I know what it is.

469
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,160
I've read enough, and she's
been tested and tested and...

470
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,890
and there's nothing else.

471
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,260
It's me.

472
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,760
Michelle...

473
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,160
look, I know that you feel guilty

474
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,100
and that you feel hurt

475
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,040
and that you would do anything
to change what happened,

476
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,510
to change how you're feeling right now.

477
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:02,110
But sometimes... you just have to push forward.

478
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,550
Darren is the strong one. I want to talk to him.

479
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,780
We've been through all of this together,

480
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,050
and without him, I can't do it. I can't.

481
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,520
He's in a coma, and then...

482
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:16,160
Tammy's gonna be taken away.

483
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,060
I'm just losing everyone I love.

484
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,070
We had a therapeutic fencing match,

485
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,780
and I lost.

486
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,740
She distracted me with the baby,

487
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,010
who is quite winning and has my ears.
They're my ears.

488
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,550
What am I gonna do now?
Can I make an observation?

489
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,590
I don't know. Can you?

490
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,990
I know you're upset,
so I'm just gonna ignore that.

491
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,930
You told Violet you were going to leave,

492
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,990
and you never did.

493
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,660
You know, you talk, you send people over.

494
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,100
Violet's smart.

495
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,900
She knows she doesn't
have twalk out that door

496
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,670
because you are always
gonna walk back in.

497
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,110
Definitely my ears.

498
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,020
Hey.

499
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,620
There's a juvie officer here
that wants to take Tammy.

500
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,120
I need you to let me keep her in the hospital

501
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,960
for another 48 hours.
You did not just interrupt my dinner

502
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,460
to ask me to hide your patient from the law?
Do you really think that
putting an 11-year-old girl

503
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,160
in jail is the right thing to do?
She stabbed her father.

504
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,970
So let's help her. Let's not
throw her to the wolves

505
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,570
and just hope they decide to raise her.
You're not social services. You fixed her arm.

506
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,070
You did your job. Look, I feel bad for the kid, too.
Do you? Because I really can't tell,

507
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,340
because it's like nothing bothers you.

508
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,980
It's like you didn't get fired,
like Violet didn't almost die.

509
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,180
It's like I'm...  it's like I'm heartless?

510
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,500
Violet.

511
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,430
Lucas is in his crib.

512
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,800
I'm just trying to sleep.

513
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,750
I love you, olet.

514
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,050
I'm really tired, Pete.

515
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,450
All right. Just listen.

516
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,920
Before all this...

517
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,000
we had a chance.

518
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,960
We had a... we had a real chance.

519
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,930
And then katie attacked you,

520
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,900
and... I've been doing
everything I can think of

521
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,340
to help you get past this.

522
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,710
But it's not helping.

523
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,650
What I'm doing...

524
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,610
it's not helping.

525
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,580
So... I'm gonna go home.

526
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,150
What?

527
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,520
You're leaving? What about Lucas?

528
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,190
He's in his crib, like you said.

529
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,600
Well, you can't... you can't just walk out

530
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,060
and leave him alone.

531
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,800
He's not alone. He has you.

532
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,370
Look, this isn't just about us.

533
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,370
We have a child. You were hurt.

534
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,270
And everyone thinks
that maybe you need time,

535
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,240
but Lucas doesn't care.

536
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,250
He needs you now. But... 

537
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,610
and if I'm gonna be a good father,

538
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,580
I've gotta do what's best for him.

539
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,860
I can't fix you.

540
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,630
I can't... make you walk out the front door.

541
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,800
You have to do it yourself.

542
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,270
And I have to let you.

543
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,180
Ow! Ow! It's okay...  leave me alone!

544
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,090
Aah!
Tammy, stop it!

545
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,550
Ah! Don't! Leave me alone.
I got her. 5 milligrams of lorazepam, now.

546
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,460
What happened?
I don't know. It came out of nowhere.

547
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,530
No! Mom's here. Mom's here.

548
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,530
It hurts. You're hurting me!
Just breathe. Tammy... 

549
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,200
Tammy, listen to me. Tell me what's going on.
I don't know! I don't know!

550
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,530
Paging Dr. Noah barnes.

551
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,630
Dr. Noah Barnes.

552
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,870
Addison, can I talk to you for a second?

553
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,140
Of course.

554
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,070
I saw, um, Tammy in a ra... in a rage last night,

555
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,040
and her heart rate jumped
and her blood pressure spiked.
Uh-huh.

556
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,010
So I'm thinking... 
So you're thinking that it's more, um,

557
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,980
physiological rather than psychological?
Yeah, but I went through everything.

558
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,920
Uh, I was here all night,
went through everything.

559
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,380
Head C.T., tox screen... 
Yeah, they're both negative,

560
00:26:45,381 --> 00:26:46,381
and the psych eval isn't conclusive.

561
00:26:46,382 --> 00:26:49,192
Did you notice if her pupils were
dilated when she got angry?

562
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,193
Yeah, yeah. It was like...
like she was on something

563
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:53,390
or like there was some kind
of exaggerated fear response,

564
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:54,700
but again, the C.T. scan...

565
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,960
Hey, you okay?

566
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,130
Me?

567
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,630
Yeah, you seem sad.

568
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,670
Or you've seemed sad lately, and I c... 

569
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,670
it's none of my business, but... 
I'm not.

570
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,270
I don't... I am sad.

571
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,240
Okay. But I can't talk about it.

572
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,740
Okay. It's...

573
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,210
Order an abdominal M.R.I.
and a urine catecholamine.

574
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,680
It's just a hunch.

575
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,650
Okay.

576
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,830
Oh.

577
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,430
I almost killed you with an educational rattle.

578
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,170
Sorry. I didn't knock
in case you were sleeping.

579
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,140
I just came to get Cooper's clothes.

580
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,240
Yeah, and to check up on me,
make sure I'm not crazy.

581
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,550
I know the drill. What,
you want to hold the baby?

582
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:48,180
Do I look like someone
who wants to hold a baby?

583
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,280
I'm wearing silk.

584
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,650
Are you breast-feeding?

585
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,290
No. No, I'm not.

586
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,220
You know, a lot of women don't breast-feed.

587
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,130
I don't need to breast-feed.

588
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,090
L... like I should feel bad about it?

589
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,060
I... I am so sick of people
trying to make me feel

590
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,500
like what I feel isn't what I should feel,

591
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,000
if that makes any sense.

592
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,540
No. No, Charlotte, I'm not
breast-feeding, okay?

593
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,040
What you do with your boobs is your business.

594
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,640
I only ask because you look
like you need a martini,

595
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,280
and if you're not breast-feeding,

596
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:22,010
you can have a martini. You want a martini?
Yeah. Please.

597
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,690
Naomi.

598
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,190
Hey.
Hey.

599
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,890
I was just, uh, coming to see Addison.

600
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh, okay. She's, uh, she's not here.

601
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,360
Oh, okay. You okay?

602
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,900
Me? Yeah.

603
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,800
Well, I guess it's just been a tough couple of days.

604
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,270
Oh, the... the Larsens?

605
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,440
Yeah.

606
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,510
You want to talk about it?

607
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,880
Uh, no, no. Uh, it's...  it's not your problem.

608
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,950
I'm gonna get back to the hospital.

609
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,650
Hey! I was looking for you.

610
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,650
Hey, Nai. I'm just really busy.

611
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,750
Oh. This Larsen thing?

612
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,990
Yeah. I'm waiting on the results
of an abdominal M.R.I.

613
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,930
For Michelle? I thought she was fine.

614
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,260
No, for Tammy.

615
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,100
Oh, but I thought that... 

616
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,830
Is everything okay?

617
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,840
I... I can't tell you everything all the time, Nai.

618
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,350
I like gin. Gin is good.

619
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,250
Gin is good.

620
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,320
So...

621
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,150
what's wrong with ya?

622
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,220
I mean, other than the whole
"psycho chopped the baby

623
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,330
out of your belly and ran" thing.

624
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,960
Other than that?

625
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,160
Is... is there something other than that?

626
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,200
You tell me.

627
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,600
I'm just a chick with a drink. No judgments.

628
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,900
Oh. I get it.

629
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,140
You don't want to open up to me.

630
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,910
I know. I'm not the touchy-feely type.

631
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,280
I got fired for being heartless.

632
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,350
Cooper apparently agrees.

633
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,390
Maybe he's right.

634
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,030
It's the baby.

635
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,200
He have 11 toes or something?

636
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,200
He's perfect.

637
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,140
He's absolutely perfect.

638
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,110
He's the baby in the commercial,

639
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,140
he's so perfect.

640
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,880
And I... I look at him, and I feel...

641
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,010
nothing.

642
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,180
I can't...

643
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,720
feel anything...

644
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,660
ever since the...

645
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,090
I mean, there's this pressure
to be all "mommy,"

646
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,630
and I'm just... I'm not.

647
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,600
I'm not ready or something.

648
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,600
I just... I don't... I don't want to deal with him.

649
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,500
I just want to... stick him in the freezer.

650
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,170
Maybe thaw him out later

651
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,170
when I'm ready to deal with him.

652
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,310
That's a... that's a horrible thing to say, isn't it?
Yes.

653
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,050
Oh.

654
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,710
But the horrible things they're...

655
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,690
things that need to be said.

656
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,750
Can I ask you question?

657
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,160
Shoot.
Where the hell is Cooper?

658
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,130
He's busy saving a patient,

659
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,030
trying to make up for the fact
that he didn't save you.

660
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,200
What?

661
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,600
Is he... blaming himself for... 

662
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,240
except for the part he blames on me.

663
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,670
I called him that night.

664
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,410
I was the reason he didn't
walk in that door and save you.

665
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,920
I guess you owe me.

666
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,160
Tammy has a very rare tumor on her ovary

667
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,370
called an ectopic pheochromocytoma.

668
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,600
It intermittently releases an excess of adrenaline,

669
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,410
Causing a rise in heart rate, blood pressure,

670
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:11,310
All leading to fear, anger
and Tammy's sudden rages.

671
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,010
And, Michelle, nothing that you did or do not do

672
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,480
During pregnancy caused this.
But we found it, which means we can fix it.

673
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,620
Yeah, I can remove it laparoscopically.
Without the need for a large incision.

674
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,520
Which means at all those moods
that you've been feeling,

675
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,930
they should stop.
All this time, I've been blaming myself.

676
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,960
I can't believe it.

677
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,230
You're gonna be okay.

678
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,000
But dad isn't.

679
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,400
But you cannot feel guilty for
something you couldn't control.

680
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,370
But I do.

681
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,210
And taking out this tumor, it won't change that.

682
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,610
It won't change the way I feel.

683
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,250
I've tried steroids, fluid restriction.

684
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:52,488
Nothing's working. Neuro says

685
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,390
he's not a surgical candidate.

686
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,860
I'm gonna take Tammy into surgery now.
Okay.

687
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,430
How's she doing?
She'll be fine.

688
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,160
Yeah, physically, but she
will not forgive herself,

689
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,900
and nothing I said was gonna get her...

690
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,800
you guys think that when we die,

691
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,400
There's like a bookkeeper,

692
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,400
and he tallies up everything we did... 

693
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,770
all the lives we saved, all the people we helped,

694
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,910
and if we've done enough good in the world,

695
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,480
that it makes up for the times
that we just completely fail?
No. I don't think anyone's keeping score.

696
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,820
I think we do what we can, we hope for the best,

697
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,280
and that's all anybody can do, right?

698
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,390
I think, uh, I think that we...
we do what we can do

699
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,890
when we know how to do it, and it hurts.

700
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,790
It just... it hurts.

701
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,420
Violet's in the kitchen.

702
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,570
Hello.

703
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,880
Hi. Come here. Hi.

704
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,880
Yes.

705
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,990
Yeah. Hmm.

706
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,290
So I have this 11-year-old patient,

707
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,830
stabbed her father.

708
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,330
Turns out she has a pheochromocytoma,

709
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,070
which made her... aggressive.

710
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,570
Um, Addison's gonna remove it,

711
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,410
but this girl just can't forgive herself.

712
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,640
Maybe she needs more time.

713
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,080
Time? So should I offer her time?

714
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,080
Well, what do you want, Cooper,

715
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,080
a magic pill?

716
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,590
Bad things happen.

717
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,220
You can fix them, maybe,

718
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,360
but it doesn't mean they didn't happen.

719
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,360
So don't go in there to that girl

720
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,360
and try to sugarcoat it
and pretend it's all better

721
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,600
when it's not.
Well, I should've seen it.

722
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,900
You know, I could've stopped it.

723
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,440
You are not responsible for what that girl did

724
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,040
any more than you're responsible
for what happened to me.

725
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,180
I'm sorry, Violet.

726
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,150
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

727
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,780
You came when you could.

728
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,320
No, no.

729
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,890
I'm sorry that I did not come sooner...

730
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,030
before, with Katie.

731
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,500
You came when you could.

732
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,030
I'm sorry.

733
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,730
I'm so sorry.

734
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,670
Mm.

735
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,070
Shh, shh.

736
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,670
You're here now.

737
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,030
So a bad thing happened,

738
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,670
and I can't change that.

739
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,640
And sometimes the things people say

740
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,970
to try to make you feel better,

741
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,040
they just come out sounding... stupid.

742
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,750
So, um...

743
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,150
you tell me

744
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,950
what you need.

745
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,920
What if he dies?

746
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,520
What if he dies,

747
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,090
and I never get to tell him I'm sorry?

748
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,070
Nobody beat me,

749
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,640
nobody tried to steal my baby,

750
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,740
nobody stabbed me, but...

751
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,040
I am wounded, Sam.

752
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,810
Noah?

753
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,350
Oh, my heart is broken.

754
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,380
And I shouldn't even
complain about it because...

755
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,320
nothing happened.

756
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,620
I mean, nothing happened to me,

757
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:30,290
not like what happened
to the Larsens and Violet.

758
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,960
You know, sometimes...
I'm almost jealous of them?

759
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:37,230
Because everybody can see their injuries,

760
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,230
so they have a right to be messed up.

761
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,570
I sent noah back to his wife.

762
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,840
I did the right thing.

763
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,840
And... my heart is broken.

764
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,710
Yeah.

765
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,450
Nai would what to say to you right now.

766
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,390
I can't talk to her, though.

767
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,660
I just can't... talk to her, 'cause it's like... 

768
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,330
she's not our Nai anymore.

769
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,830
Exactly.

770
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,610
I'm sorry, dad.

771
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,310
I'm so sorry, daddy.

772
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,220
Hi.

773
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,730
Hi.

774
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,200
Nice shoes.

775
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,830
I hate talking about shoes with you.

776
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,570
I... I hate that at's all we talk about.

777
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,770
I miss you.

778
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,780
I... where are you?

779
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,610
Where... where did you go, Addison?

780
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,450
Like I said, nice shoes.

781
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,460
You came.

782
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:54,070
No, wait. I... I need you to listen. Just listen?

783
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,300
Um...

784
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,870
I want to be a good mother.

785
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,570
I want to be a good mother so badly,

786
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,450
And, um, I'm trying to
figure out how to do that,

787
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,380
how to do that when I look at this baby

788
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,350
and I feel...

789
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,850
Uh...

790
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,120
Katie stole something from me.

791
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,090
She changed me, and I don't
know how to change it back.

792
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,290
But I'm trying to be a good mother, okay?

793
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,490
Okay.

794
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,630
And... and you're right. You're right.

795
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,100
It's not... it's...

796
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,070
 it's not just about you and me anymore.

797
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,040
And being a good mother

798
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,040
means doing what's best for your child.

799
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,040
And you may not understand this,

800
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:37,010
and you may never... forgive me for it,

801
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,410
but I...

802
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,920
I walked out that door tonight

803
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,550
to do what's best for Lucas.

804
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,150
This is what's best for Lucas.

805
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,920
You're what's best for Lucas.

806
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,880
This is me being a good mom.

807
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,420
Violet?

808
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,560
Violet.

809
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,900
Shh, shh, shh.
