1
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Should we...

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
talk about this?

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
no.

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,400
no talking.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,000
my life has too much talking.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,300
how does kevin leave one sockehind?

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,600
i mean, don't you think
he'd notice that one bare foot

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,700
when he went to put his shoes on?

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,300
call him.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,900
he walked out.

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,400
you miss him.
call him.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,400
do you want to go get a drink tonight?

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,500
i'll figure it out better then i'm drunk.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,900
i... can't. i-i have to work.

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,100
work?

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,100
wyatt work? pacific wellcare work?

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,400
working for the enemy?

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,700
oncofertility is new,
and it's interesting.

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,300
you think wyatt's interesting.

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,600
well... he is.

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,700
he's arrogant.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,000
yeah, but he's smart
and incredibly handsome.

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,700
you're not really...

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
oh, okay, you know what? never mind.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,000
- i am--none of my business.
- exactly.

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,300
if you want to sell your soul,

27
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,300
i'll still be your friend.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,500
when i used to go in for chemo,

29
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,700
to help me get through it,

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
i'd concentrate on exactly
what was going to happen.

31
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,000
and when you implanted
the ovarian tissue,

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,200
i tried to imagine
the blood starting to flow

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,300
and my ovaries starting to work again--

34
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,100
claudia, this is not your fault.

35
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,000
the tissue is very fragile,

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,500
and your body has been through
much more than any body should.

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,700
i just thought if i
was positive, it would work.

38
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,900
i picked out the crib and i
painted the nursery yellow.

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,600
we tried, claudia.

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
there just wasn't enough
blood supply in your abdomen

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,400
for the ovarian tissue to survive.

42
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,500
and there's nothing else?

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,500
i'm not gonna be able to have a baby?

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,200
wait, well, we only implanted
half of the ovarian tissue

45
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,300
that you took out, right?

46
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,800
right, but we just saw,
the procedure doesn't work.

47
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,100
<i>no, my procedure doesn't work,</i>

48
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,900
but if we were to implant
the ovarian tissue deeper,

49
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,800
more proximate, to--to a more
vigorous blood supply, then--

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,000
- next to the uterus?
- yeah.

51
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,100
well, what you're saying
is theoretically possible,

52
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,500
but the surgery is far too complicated.

53
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,600
- i don't know anyone that can--
- i do.

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,300
and this person could help me?

55
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,900
i don't know. i'll have to ask her.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,900
oh, sorry. betsey.

57
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,500
pacific wellcare ruins
another day... and a shirt.

58
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,000
heather was supposed to
pick her up first thing.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,700
that's okay. i got
another shirt in the office.

60
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,700
honey, maybe not such a
good idea to be throwing balls around

61
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,000
- in the office, okay?
- it wasn't her fault.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,900
- it was mine.
- what wasn't your fault, champ?

63
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,200
oh, dr. freedman.

64
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,500
arlene. hi. oh, my god.
is this michael?

65
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,800
dude, you're a giant.

66
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,200
will, you remember me?

67
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
hi, jeffrey.
that's a pretty cool plane.

68
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,100
hey, let's go back. come on.

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,300
so where you been?
it's been, uh...

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,100
- two years.
- yeah.

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,500
i moved the boys to switzerland...

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,100
- oh.
- for jeffrey.

73
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,200
i found this great
experimental program there

74
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,500
- for autistic children...
- mm-hmm.

75
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,200
nontraditional therapy, megavitamins,

76
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,300
- diet modification...
- mm-hmm.

77
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
along with art, music therapy.

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and how's it been going?

79
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,500
better, i think.

80
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
his temper's under control a little more.

81
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,300
um, he's obsessed with airplanes.

82
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,400
- sometimes he'll even talk to you...
- wow.

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
as long as it's about planes.

84
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,900
planes are good.

85
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
talking about planes...

86
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,100
even better.

87
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,600
and how's his health otherwise?

88
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,800
oh, jeffrey's fine.
no, i-it's michael, actually.

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,900
- oh.
- he caught a cold on the plane.

90
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,700
it's probably just some bug,

91
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,500
- but, you know...
- all right.

92
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,000
- i wanted to be safe.
- up for you.

93
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,700
so how'd you like switzerland, michael?

94
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,800
they had a cable car,

95
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,400
and there's this one place where
you could take a chocolate tour,

96
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,100
and my best friend has
sheeps and cows at his house.

97
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,800
what? sheeps and cows at his house?

98
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,100
i made butter.

99
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,500
you did? you made butter?
really? wow.

100
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,400
hmm. 102. does your throat hurt, michael?

101
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
- nope.
- okay.

102
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
open up for me, big and wide.

103
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
tilt your head back. ahh.

104
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,900
dr. freedman?

105
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,300
what is it?

106
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,300
what's wrong?

107
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,500
i need to ask you something,

108
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,600
and i know what you're gonna say,

109
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,800
so i don't want you to say anything,

110
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
at least, not until you hear me out.

111
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
it's about wyatt. i need a favor.

112
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,800
no. i'm not helping you get a date.

113
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,500
huh. no. not for him, for my patient.

114
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,400
<i>- his patient.
- who i'm trying to help.</i>

115
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,600
but i can't, and you can.

116
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,400
- we have to close the doors.
- see,

117
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,100
even cooper realizes pacific wellcare
is putting us out of business.

118
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,000
no, we have to close the doors.

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,600
my patient has the measles
and was in reception

120
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,200
for half an hour running around.
everyone that was out--

121
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,500
all our patients this morning
have been exposed.

122
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
measles? my pregnant patient...

123
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,500
- and the elderly.
- all at risk.

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,800
- we have to close the doors.
- we have to close the doors.

128
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,800
i'm sorry for the inconvenience,

129
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,400
but the virus stays airborne
for up to four hours.

130
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
we need to make sure everyone
who was exposed

131
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,700
has been immunized.

132
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
uh, excuse me?

133
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
can i get the shot now?

134
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,100
i have a lunch at 12:30.

135
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,800
oh, i'm sorry. it contains a live virus.

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
it's not safe to take when you're pregnant.

137
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,000
but if your blood comes back
and your antibodies are low,

138
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
then we can treat it with immunoglobulin.

139
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
and if that doesn't work?

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,700
doesn't measles lead to birth defects?

141
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,400
let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?

142
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,400
uh, we need to notify
l.a. county health.

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
they're gonna want to do
a complete survey.

144
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,100
and they're always awful.

145
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,700
as if we didn't have
enough to do this morning...

146
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,900
okay, i have a light day.
you have to deal with this.

147
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,100
i'll speak to the health department.

148
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
i'm, uh, i'm in the mood for a fight.

149
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,000
- will's fine.
- so far,

150
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,700
but he hasn't been vaccinated,
and he's at risk to get this.

151
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
it's the measles. i-i--

152
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,300
when my parents were growing up,
everyone got it.

153
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,500
and hundreds of people
died from it every year.

154
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,100
- the vaccine changed--
- don't even think of suggesting--

155
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,300
there's no proven link
between vaccinations and autism.

156
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,200
it's not just me. i have
talked to dozens of parents.

157
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,100
you vaccinated jeffrey,

158
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,400
and it was like a light
went out inside him,

159
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,300
and he's living in some parallel world.

160
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,600
- arlene--
- you don't live with him.

161
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,800
so don't ask me to risk will, too.

162
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
hey.

163
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,600
hey, i can't get ahold of betsey's mom.

164
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,700
i don't know if she's been immunized.

165
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
- most kids have been.
- you don't know her mother, okay?

166
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
she forgot to pick her up.

167
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,600
you think she remembered doctor visits?

168
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,800
sh-should i just give her
the shot to be sure?

169
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,600
i mean, she played with that kid
for, like, a half-hour.

170
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,200
you have 24 hours...?

171
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,600
so wait for the mom and ask,
spare her the needle if you can.

172
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,100
grab a chart. we're checking every patient

173
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,800
who was in here this morning
for immunization.

174
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,300
how many of these are
we looking at, cooper?

175
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,700
- how many what?
- these littleime bombs--

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,600
kids coming in without their vaccinations.

177
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
the vast majority...

178
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,500
whether or not to vaccinate should
not even be open for debate.

179
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,300
well, it isn't, but i agree with
the academy of american pediatrics

180
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,800
that we shouldn't abandon patients
who choose not to vaccinate.

181
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
cooper's right.

182
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
you can't kick a kid out just because

183
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,200
the parents believe in a
conspiracy theory about vaccines.

184
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,300
the c.d.c. is clear--

185
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,400
vaccines do not cause autism,
they save lives.

186
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
that's the end of story.

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,700
hey, i was just in the pediatric
waiting area with betsey.

188
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,200
uh, this is michael's mom's,
and she left it in the lobby.

189
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,200
so if she was down
at pacific wellcare...

190
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,900
then her kids were, too.
someone's going to tell ...?

191
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,200
uh, hi. i need to speak to dr. king.

192
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,300
it's important.

193
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,800
you're dr. freedman, right?

194
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,000
- yeah.
- i'm sheldon. sheldon wallace.

195
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,400
- violet's friend.
- right, yeah.

196
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,100
well, i hope so.
i... i'd like that.

197
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,000
she's, uh... how is she... violet?

198
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,200
- exposed to the measles.
- exposed to the measles?

199
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,600
a kid in our practice
has the measles,

200
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
which is why i'm here.

201
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
this concerns me how?

202
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,300
well, you have this wonderful coffee bar

203
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,000
that you advertise so prominently,

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,900
and a lot of our patients
wander by on their way upstairs.

205
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,900
it is good coffee.

206
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,200
you've exposed my entire
practice to the measles?

207
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,600
claudia jenkins needs a surgeon,

208
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,600
a surgeon with a background in
both gynecology and fertility,

209
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,800
someone who can implant the ovarian tissue

210
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,500
close enough to the uterine blood supply

211
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,200
to allow her to produce her own eggs.

212
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
naomi was right. you want a miracle.

213
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,800
no, i want you--

214
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
just as a surgeon.

215
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,500
you'd perform the procedure
at st. ambrose-- neutral territory.

216
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,200
you bill all you want.
naomi and i do the follow-up.

217
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,300
you just go in and cut
and implant, and you're done.

218
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,500
claudia gets a baby. you're not
tainted by working with me.

219
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,000
take a look.

220
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,700
tell me that this surgery
wouldn't be amazing.

221
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
you don't get me at all.

222
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,500
you think all i want to do is cut?

223
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,900
if i do a surgery,i do the follow-up.

224
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,500
i make sure it takes,

225
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,700
i see the pregnancy the whole way through.

226
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,100
now you may just look
at procedures and outcomes.

227
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,400
but my patients get me
for the whole process.

228
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,700
well, that would be even better.

229
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,700
read the file, dr. montgomery...

230
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,300
before you say no.

231
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,100
are you still having sex

232
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
with the same guy?

233
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,900
with the same guy.

234
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,700
finally gonna fess up
and tell me with who?

235
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,100
<i>i told you whom it was,
and you didn't believe me.</i>

236
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,500
<i>who it was,and you told me pete,</i>

237
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,800
which is obfuscation.

238
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
- lying, really.
- it's pete, cooper.

239
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,300
i'm having sex with pete.

240
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,100
you need me to prove it to you?

241
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,900
lift your shirt.

242
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,800
- excuse me?
- i need you to lift up your shirt.

243
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,900
- trust me. i'm a doctor.
- you're a pediatrician.

244
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,900
that's like half a doctor.

245
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
lift.

246
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,100
this isn't one of your weird...

247
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
there's a tattoo.

248
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,500
you're sleeping with violet?

249
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,600
do you have to sleep with everybody?

250
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,800
i don't sleep with everybody a--

251
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,000
you sleep with people and
then they leave the practice.

252
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
do you want violet
to leave the practice?

253
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,300
i'm not gonna leave.

254
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,200
- you told him?
- it's just sex.

255
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,500
oh, no. you're not capable
of just having sex.

256
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,000
you are a relationship junkie.

257
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,800
and pete is the anti-relationship.

258
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,900
pete is the ruiner of relationships.

259
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
- pete is--
- right here.

260
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
and you know it's true.

261
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,200
isn't that, like, the proverbial
pot calling the kettle--

262
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,600
cooper, cooper, cooper, i'm fine.

263
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
we're fine.

264
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,700
there's nothing to worry about.

265
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,900
claudia jenkins could have a baby.

266
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,000
thank you, addison.

267
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,900
there's one condition.

268
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,800
- yes.
- this is a one-time thing.

269
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
we help claudia, and then you
are done working with wyatt.

270
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,600
- you're...you're blackmailing me.
- no, no, it's not blackmail.

271
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
it's ...?

272
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,200
i'm doing this for your own good, nai.

273
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,900
what, so--so that i don't become
corrupted and evil like him,

274
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,200
so i don't extort promises
from my friends?

275
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
do you want me to do the surgery?

276
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,700
i guess i have no choice.

277
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,000
okay, so that's it.
everybody's been immunized.

278
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
everybody that was here
has been contacted.

279
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,500
you can rele all these
immunization records--

280
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,600
oh, no, he can't.

281
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,900
sonya nichols. county health department.

282
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,100
i'm gonna need those.

283
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,400
oh, uh, sam bennett. i, uh,
i called you.

284
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,100
uh, are--are those all
the immunization records?

285
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,600
uh, yeah. yeah, this is everything.

286
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,300
i want the vaccination records
of all the patients in your practice,

287
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,000
and then after i interview all personnel

288
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,800
and review their employment certificates,

289
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,300
i'll need to inspect your
isolation facilities.

290
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,400
well, we don't have, uh,
isolation facilities per se,

291
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,500
uh, but--well, wait. we, uh,
we provide for rooms.

292
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,500
- we ...we just--
- are not up to current guidelines?

293
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,900
or are you aware of the recent
changes in those standards?

294
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
uh,

295
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,900
this isn't gonna be very much fun, is it?

296
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,900
you want to show me around?

297
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,900
yeah. all right, this way.

298
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,000
his--his fever, it was 104
by the time i got home.

299
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
i-i couldn't get it down.

300
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
how you feeling, michael?

301
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,400
i'm really cold,
and my stomach hurts.

302
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,700
- he vomited twice.
- his lungs are congested.

303
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
oh, okay. okay, we got you.

304
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,300
it's okay.
we're gonna get you some fluids,

305
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,800
and we'll bring that fever down,
and you'll feel better.

306
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,900
i need a nasal cannula at
2 liters, chest x-rays and ...

307
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,800
cultures times two.

308
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,200
i don't understand.
why is he so sick?

309
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,400
arlene, measles is serious.

310
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,300
it can lead to pneumonia, encephalitis--

311
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,700
all sorts of other complications.

312
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,700
...?

313
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,100
michael's resting now.
his fever's down.

314
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,600
but he's still having trouble breathing.

315
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,200
my husband is-- is still in switzerland.

316
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
you don't think he... needs to fly back?

317
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,600
if it was my son, i'd come.

318
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,400
arlene, we need to talk about will.

319
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,700
i-i--no. i told you no.

320
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
no vaccinations.

321
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,900
i don't think you can risk putting will
through what michael's going through.

322
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,200
i can't risk putting will through
what jeffrey's gone through.

323
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,200
i lost one child to autism.
i can't lose another.

324
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,000
- arlene, you won't--
- don't you think ...

325
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,200
seeing michael in there like that...

326
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,500
i would do anything for my kids.

327
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,700
i can't.

328
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
look at him.

329
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,000
don't you remember
when he was 2, that smile?

330
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,600
he'd light up the room.

331
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,300
and then you vaccinated him,
and that kid vanished.

332
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,300
those vaccines took him away.

333
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
i don't care what you know.

334
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,200
i know what i know.

335
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,300
i know what i lost.

336
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,200
i can't risk it again.

337
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,200
i can't believe this
health department lady

338
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,800
is making us jump through all these hoops.

339
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
she's horrible.

340
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,900
how's michael?

341
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,300
uh, not good, and arlene still
won't let me vaccinate will.

342
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,500
- you should call family services.
- you serious?

343
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
yes, it's child abuse.

344
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,500
she's knowingly putting her son
at risk for getting really sick.

345
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
- it's irresponsible.
- it's a parent's decision.

346
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
yeah, well, if i find out that
heather didn't vaccinate betsey,

347
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
i'll report her.

348
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,300
can i see you a moment, dr. bennett?

349
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
perfect.

350
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
that can't be good.

351
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
sam's right. i gotta call.

352
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,300
calling d.c.f.s.
while her other child

353
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,100
is still in the hospital
would just be cruel.

354
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
cruel? putting ant other child
in dangerous is cruel.

355
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,300
exposing a city to measles is cruel.

356
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
violet's right. you can't fault the
mother because she chose not to--

357
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,000
oh, yeah, of course
you're agree with violet,

358
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
you're sleeping with her.

359
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,500
i agree with her because she's right,

360
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,400
and i'm sleeping with her because it's
part of the fun of being an adult.

361
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,000
we can do whatever we want
with whomever we want,

362
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,400
however much we want.

363
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,900
so if everyone would just relax
and let us be adults about this...

364
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,700
we need to go over protocol.

365
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,400
um, how did you dispose of the
contaminated exam items

366
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,600
used on the sick boy?

367
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,700
tongue depressors, gloves,
thermometer cover?

368
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,100
uh, we use a, uh,
a medical waste company.

369
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,100
needlesticks--did you follow
c.d.c. approved guidelines?

370
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,200
i-i-i assume so.

371
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
i-i can check, but--

372
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,000
and what kind of
ventilation system do you have?

373
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,100
'cause you'd be amazed
how many practices

374
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,400
don't have a laminar flow room.

375
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,200
right. yes. laminar flow is good.

376
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,500
you don't know what that is, do you?

377
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
dr. nichols, look, i've spent hours,

378
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,600
uh, jumping through hoops for you--

379
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,800
you shouldn't have to jump through hoops.

380
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,000
it should all be standard.
it should all be covered

381
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,800
in your procedures and policy manual,

382
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,200
which it's required by law you have.

383
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
so i can see it?

384
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
you want to see our p-procedures
and policy manual?

385
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
yes.

386
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,400
okay. look, we just rented out a floor

387
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,600
and moved all oufiles.

388
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,000
so it may take a while.

389
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
okay, well, you have till
tomorrow to find it.

390
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,500
violet has got to know
that this is not good for her

391
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,800
or the practice.

392
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,800
says the person who
slept with my brother.

393
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
oh, now that was--

394
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,300
- oh, different?
- oh, yeah,

395
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,500
- totally and completely different...
- uh-huh.

396
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,900
- in every way.
- what?

397
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,900
- are you okay with it?
- yeah, she seems happy.

398
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,800
pete... seems happy, you know, i...

399
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
- hi.
- hi.

400
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
can i help you?

401
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,400
yeah, i'm looking for dell parker.

402
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,700
uh, you are?

403
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,500
i'm heather. i'm betsey's mom.

404
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,600
oh. uh, yeah. his office
is at the end of the hall.

405
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,900
- it's the last one.
- thank you.

406
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,900
uh-huh.

407
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,600
that's heather? she's so...

408
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,200
she's not at all what i expected.

409
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,700
why did you do that?

410
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,600
<i>- violet--
- i told you to tell you,</i>

411
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
not to tell everyone.

412
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,500
- i have to go to the bathroom.
- what's your issue? you--

413
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,400
you don't want me to be happy?

414
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,500
of course i want you to be happy.

415
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,900
- i have to go to the bathroom.
- are you jealous of pete,

416
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,700
- is that it?
- no. no.

417
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
okay, maybe a little.

418
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,500
look, you have what
charlotte and i had--

419
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,800
the "just sex" part--
before it got all messed up

420
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,000
with emotions and feelings and betrayal,

421
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,100
which is where the "just sex"
train ultimately leads.

422
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
i don't want you to get hurt.

423
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,900
look, this is not
"romeo and juliet," coop.

424
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,700
there's not some tragedy looming.

425
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,100
we--we had an itch and we scratched...

426
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and scratched... and scratched.

427
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
okay.

428
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
that's all it is.

429
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,200
it's just that last time... allan--

430
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,500
i know what i'm doing, coop.
i do.

431
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
i'm sorry i told...

432
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
everyone.

433
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,700
can i pee now?

434
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
yeah. yeah.

435
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
okay.

436
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
- mommy!
- hi!

437
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,100
i had a job interview,
and they really liked me,

438
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,900
so they made me take
all these different tests.

439
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,400
it took forever. i'm sorry.

440
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,700
babe... why don't you
go finish that puzzle, okay?

441
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
mommy needs to talk to daddy.

442
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,700
you couldn't call?

443
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,200
you leave your daughter alone
all day and you don't call?

444
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,100
- i forgot my phone.
- are you using?

445
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,800
<i>no. no.</i>

446
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
look, i know you're mad,

447
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
but i knew she was safe
with you, okay?

448
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,100
i-i couldn't leave to make a call.

449
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,300
i did not want to blow this interview.

450
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
well, she's not safe, okay?

451
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,600
she was exposed to the measles today,

452
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,400
and i-i don't even know
if s's vaccinated because,

453
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
you know, i'm not around enough,
and you...

454
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,400
is she vaccinated?

455
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,800
um...

456
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
you don't know, do you?

457
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
no.

458
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
i thought that was you.

459
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
not going home?

460
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,800
ugh. it's been a hell of a day.

461
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,600
yeah, but a cup of
non-fourth-floor coffee,

462
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,500
the fresh air, the ocean--
it all goes away.

463
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,200
look at you, all calm and buddhist.

464
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,900
so you and violet?

465
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,000
it's no big deal.
it's not a relationship.

466
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,700
well...

467
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,900
if you're happy...

468
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,200
things not going well
with you and kevin?

469
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
kevin and i are...

470
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,900
different,

471
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,300
and i still haven't
figured out

472
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,000
if that's a good thing
or a bad thing.

473
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
you want my advice?

474
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,600
- please.
- ignore all advice.

475
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,800
cooper is all over violet about
how i'm gonna destroy her life.

476
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,800
i just think people should be left
to decide things for themselves.

477
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,000
and what do you think?

478
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,500
- about you and kevin?
- about you and violet.

479
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
oh.

480
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,700
w-well, i...

481
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,500
the conversation is easy,
the sex is...

482
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
good.

483
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,800
we laugh a lot.
i mean, it's no big deal.

484
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
we're just similar and
we want the same thing,

485
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
so it's working out.

486
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
what?

487
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,700
you've got all that,
and it's nbig deal?

488
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,500
isn't that what
a relationship is?

489
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,200
oh, violet.

490
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
good morning.

491
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
hello, sheldon.

492
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,900
it's good to see you.

493
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,200
i've missed seeing you.

494
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,600
elevator rides are always
more pleasant with you.

495
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
hold the elevator.

496
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,700
glad to see i'm
not the only one.

497
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
so you look...

498
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,000
did you do something
different? y-you look great.

499
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,300
she did something different.

500
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,800
well, whatever it is,
just keep doing it.

501
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,000
there's a little bleeder
on the distal uterus.

502
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
got it.

503
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,900
hey, do you think
i missed the boat with pete?

504
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,300
ugh. you didn't miss e pete
boat.you dodged hurricane pete.

505
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,700
you really think it's
gonna end that badly?

506
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,000
are we talking about
the same pete?

507
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,800
sorry i'm late.
lots of patients to save.

508
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,300
well, why don't you go
save some more and let us work?

509
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,700
work, or discuss
dating colleagues?

510
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,100
which truthfully, i
concur is a bad idea.

511
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,300
however, since this is
our last case together, monty,

512
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,700
it won't be a problem for us.

513
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,100
she's involved with
a cop who has a gun.

514
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,500
yeah, so you better
watch out.

515
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,400
a cop? are you
really dating a cop?

516
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,800
i am not intimidated
by a man with a gun.

517
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,900
are you?

518
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,400
intimidad? hardly.

519
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,800
no, i was thinking
of their propensity

520
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,900
for depression and
divorce and alcoholism.

521
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,700
yeah, as opposed
to doctors,

522
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,700
who have a stable,
stress-free life.

523
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,100
true, true, but i could see

524
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,000
how a cop fulfills
some kind of base fantasy

525
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,800
for a woman like you.

526
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,000
wow. did you miss the
sexual harassment seminar?

527
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,100
well, i meant it
as a compliment.

528
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,800
i mean, she's a rich,
classy woman.

529
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,200
he's your version
of the pool boy.

530
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,600
okay, enough.

531
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,500
you are here to watch.

532
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,900
you know what i got here?

533
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,000
i'm not in the mood, charlotte.

534
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,500
public health notifications,
isolation requirements,

535
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,200
incident reports,
c.d.c. surveys.

536
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
we all have jobs to do.

537
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,900
i have jobs i'm not able to do

538
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,100
because i'm dealing with
the mess you made.

539
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,400
and i have a mom who feels like
she lost one son to autism

540
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,900
and may be losing
another one to the measles,

541
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,800
and she's got another one
sitting out here exposed,

542
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,700
and maybe i'm just not
persuasive enough,

543
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,600
but he's vulnerable,

544
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,300
and she's not gonna let me
do anything about it.

545
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,700
so i'm really sorry if i
piled on some paperwork for you,

546
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,700
but i don't need crap
from you right now.

547
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
he can't breathe.

548
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,100
full custody?

549
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,900
you want full custody?

550
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,400
i'm trying
to keep betsey safe.

551
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,800
now? now that i've changed?

552
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,300
now that i'm finally
getting it together?

553
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,800
you left her here all day.

554
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,900
but i got the job, dell.

555
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
okay, but...

556
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,900
how long until
you blow it off

557
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,100
because, you know,
you hate it

558
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,900
or you're bored or
you start using again?

559
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,100
i got the job,

560
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,900
and then i got home
and i got this letter.

561
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,900
and you know
what i wanted to do,

562
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,200
but i didn't.

563
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,800
i freaked, but then i looked
at betsey, and i didn't use.

564
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,000
i came here to talk to you
about what's best for her.

565
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,200
i'm glad
u didn't get high.

566
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,500
but it doesn't change things.

567
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,700
all you see is that girl
from the valley

568
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,700
that you
used to get high with.

569
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,900
i stopped.

570
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,000
well, you might have been
stronger than me then,

571
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
but don't forget
who got me started, okay?

572
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,900
because i wasn't
always like this.

573
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,000
just don't make me spend
every last dime that i have

574
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,200
trying to fight you.

575
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,000
it's gonna push me
back over the edge.

576
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,200
every bit of tissue
around her ovaries is friable.

577
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,400
i can't place a stitch
without her starting to bleed.

578
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,500
how much chemo did you give her?

579
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,300
i did what i had to
to save her life.

580
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,700
no, there's too much blood.
i've gotta clear the field.

581
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,900
- damn it.
- you need to implant the tissue now.

582
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,700
everything i touch bleeds.
we can't do this.

583
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,100
you have time and to
complete the implant.

584
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,100
back off, wyatt.

585
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,700
i can't see the target
through the blood...

586
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,200
and her pressure's dropping.

587
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,000
if you don't
get this done now,

588
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,700
she loses any chance
of ever having a baby.

589
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,300
if i don't stop and we don
have to worry about a baby.

590
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,300
addison.

591
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,800
all right. we're done.

592
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,900
wyatt, shut your mouth
while i save her life.

593
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,700
it won't pass.
his throat's too swollen.

594
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,400
get the ber-optic scope now.

595
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,100
we gotta ventilate him.

596
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,000
heart rate is dropping.
sats are bottoming out.

597
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,200
where's the damn scope?

598
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,400
it's coming, cooper.

599
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,400
open up a surgical tray.
i'm gonna crike him.

600
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,500
hold this.

601
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,300
what--what--what is that?
what--what are you gonna do?

602
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,300
just wait, cooper.
the scope's coming.

603
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,100
his heart's 40.
i'm doing this. betadine.

604
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,100
wait. wait!

605
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,000
slowly. easy does it.

606
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,200
almost there. almost there.

607
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
i got it.

608
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,800
sounds good.

609
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
he's gonna be okay?

610
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,300
set the vent at an f102
of 100, rate of 24.

611
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,900
i need a minute.

612
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,700
hey, i'll watch 'em
for a minute.

613
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,800
hey.

614
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,100
come here.
come here for a second.

615
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,900
get the hell
away from my son.

616
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,700
mommy!

617
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,600
- you have to stop.
- your son is dying in there.

618
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
get the hell away from me.

619
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,500
- mrs. perkins, please.
- no!

620
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,200
well.

621
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
are u okay?

622
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,300
the vaccine is safe.

623
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,500
you don't know.

624
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,400
it is.

625
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,900
look at him
and tell me it is.

626
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,700
vaccines are the
standard of care.

627
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,800
dr. freedman did something
that was medically necessary.

628
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,700
he assaulted my son.

629
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,400
and i am going to sue
this hospital, so help me,

630
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,800
if something happens to him.

631
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,300
i did what i felt i had to.

632
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,800
it wasn't yours to do.

633
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,400
it wasn't yos to do.

634
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,600
code blue, p.i.c.u.

635
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,100
code blue, p.i.c.u.

636
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,600
i went under thinking about
the crib in the yellow room.

637
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,800
i wish we could've done more.

638
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,700
i know i should just be
grateful for being alive.

639
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,300
we all wanted to help you.

640
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,900
and i'm not giving up,
claudia.

641
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,800
i'll be back later, okay?

642
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,400
nai, would you go over post-op
instructions wh claudia?

643
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,800
i'll be right back.

644
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,300
what was that about?

645
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,400
that was about
my embarrassment

646
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,600
for picking the wrong
person for the job.

647
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,900
you're blaming this on me?

648
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,900
the chemo ravaged
her entire body.

649
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,100
there weren't 2 square
centimeters of healthy tissue

650
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,700
that could've held a suture
let alone an implant.

651
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,300
you talk like
you searched exhaustively.

652
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,600
what are you talking about?

653
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,500
you didn't push.

654
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,500
i agreed to do a totally
experimental procedure that,

655
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,600
going in, we all knew
was a longshot,

656
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,400
and when i felt the risks
to the patient's life

657
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,200
outweighed the potential
for success,

658
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,400
i chose to save the patient.

659
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,300
you had time.

660
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,600
you could've controlled
the bleeding

661
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,300
and implanted the tissue,
but you hate me,

662
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,400
so you didn't want to be told
what to do, so you stopped.

663
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,700
you wanted to prove
that you knew better.

664
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,700
i'm no surgeon, but i
think there was time.

665
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,000
well, i'm sorry
if what happened in there

666
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,500
didn't produce the results
that you wanted for some study,

667
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,600
but i made the right call.

668
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
you really believe that?

669
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,900
- dr. bennett.
- i got it. i got it.

670
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,000
okay.

671
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,300
everything is in here.

672
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,500
all right? protocols for
workspace contamination,

673
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,000
follow-ups for patients
with positive labs,

674
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,800
blood draw procedures that
include responses to needlesticks.

675
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,700
okay.

676
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,300
wait, that's it?
you...

677
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,600
you're not gonna read it

678
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,200
and ask me about our policies
on work-related injuries or--

679
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
i'm sure you did
a very thorough job.

680
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,700
you knew that i wouldn't
be able to find it,

681
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,100
and you knew that i would kill
myself trying to come up with it.

682
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,600
well, by law, your office
needed to have that.

683
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,400
- now you do.
- you enjoy this, don't you,

684
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,700
the power?

685
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,700
coming in here,
pushing me around...

686
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
oh, i...

687
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,100
that's not true at all.

688
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,000
i've been nothing
but professional.

689
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
you've been a bully.

690
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,400
you just can't stand
real doctors, can you?

691
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,700
do you...

692
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,100
know what it's like

693
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,400
to have everyone hate you
before they even meet you,

694
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,700
to walk in the door

695
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,800
and have everyone assume
that you're awful?

696
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,200
i don't know what some
evil public servant

697
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,600
did to you in a past life,
but i'm here to do a job,

698
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
a job i think is important.

699
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,000
if there were
a serious outbreak here,

700
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,900
you'd want someone like me,
because i am a real doctor

701
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,000
who chose this job
to help people.

702
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,100
all right, well, maybe
i was wrong, but...

703
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,600
for the past two days,

704
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,400
you haven't even
looked me in the eye

705
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,400
or even acknowledged
that i'm a human being.

706
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,200
what is your problem?

707
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,200
for two days, i've been thinking
your lips would taste like chocolate,

708
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
and i couldn't look at them.

709
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,600
i'm--i'm--i'really sorry
that i misjudged you.

710
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,400
do you believe that
people can change?

711
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,000
ugh! look, if one more person
butts in and tries to tell me

712
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
what pete is and
what we should be doing--

713
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,900
wow.

714
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,800
uh, i was talking
about heather.

715
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,900
oh. okay.

716
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
so you and heather...

717
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,500
okay, well, heather says that

718
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,200
she's not the person
she used to be,

719
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
and...

720
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,300
that by taking
custody of betsey,

721
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,000
i'm punishing her
for her past.

722
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,200
are you?

723
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,700
i just don't know
if i can believe it,

724
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
that she's different now.

725
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,800
well, you have to
protect your daughter.

726
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,000
right.

727
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,900
but if you're asking me
if i think people can change,

728
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,700
if i didn't believe that,
i couldn't do what i do.

729
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
when you look at
betsey and heather,

730
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,300
and yotake away
what you want,

731
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,100
what's best
for your daughter?

732
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
what?

733
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,700
i don't think
it's ridiculous...

734
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,500
the idea that you and me--

735
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,600
that...

736
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,300
we could be more than sex.

737
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,200
pete--

738
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,900
don't think about
what cooper would say

739
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,400
or sam or naomi
or anybody.

740
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
just think about...

741
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
what you think.

742
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,400
why does it have to
be a crazy idea?

743
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,700
asystole. i can't
find a pulse.

744
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,500
resuming c.p.r.
another round of epi.

745
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,500
cooper, we've done everything.
it's been over a halhour.

746
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,000
where's the atropine?
come on!

747
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,500
it's time to call it.

748
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,100
i'm running the code.
i decide when we're done.

749
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,300
please...
don't stop.

750
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,200
time of death--3:37.

751
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
michael?

752
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,700
he just learned
to tie his shoes.

753
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,300
he can't be gone.

754
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,000
not like this.

755
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,700
oh, michael.

756
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,200
oh, michael.

757
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,200
oh, michael. michael.

758
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
i thought...

759
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,600
it was gonna be...
like a cold.

760
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,400
i was trying
to protect him.

761
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,500
you did everything
you could.

762
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,200
what are you
doing in here?

763
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,800
i was thinking about
the two doctors

764
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,200
that came before addison...

765
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,500
about you...

766
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,500
and them leaving.

767
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,800
people can change,
violet.

768
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
isn't that
what you told dell?

769
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,900
yes, you can change.

770
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,100
i-i don't know if i can change
what i know about you...

771
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,300
how i look at you.

772
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,800
what about what you feel?

773
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,200
well, i can't
separate that out.

774
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,700
what i feel is aombination
of all those things,

775
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,000
and i can't help it.

776
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,800
look what happened
between you and meg.

777
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,900
i screwed that up, but it was
wrong before i screwed it up.

778
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,300
i like what we have, pete.

779
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
i mean, i...

780
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,000
i love what we have.

781
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,900
but i don't...

782
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,900
want it to be more.

783
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,300
wouldn't that be
a good thing--

784
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,300
what we have,

785
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,900
but...

786
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
more?

787
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,200
i don't know.

788
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,700
what are you doing here?

789
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,900
come to get evidence?

790
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
there's no needles,
dell, no booze.

791
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,700
- hey, beautiful.
- hi, daddy.

792
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,800
i came to apologize.

793
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,100
look...

794
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,000
you were right, okay?

795
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,600
i-i should've called,

796
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,800
and i should've been more
responsible about the vaccines--

797
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
not about that.

798
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,300
for getting you started...

799
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,300
addicted.

800
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,900
i should have kept you away
from my friends back then.

801
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,900
i'm sorry, heather.

802
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,900
well,
i'm doing better now.

803
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
you know,
we're doing better.

804
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,000
i know. i can see.

805
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,400
but i need
more time with her,

806
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,400
something more permanent.

807
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,000
dell--

808
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,300
maybe we can...

809
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,900
work it out,

810
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,500
you and me, without court.

811
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,200
okay?

812
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,000
i just...

813
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,900
i need to know
she's safe.

814
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,600
apparently, i'm a misogynistic,
manipulative son of a bitch...

815
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,300
and ungrateful.

816
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,000
you agreed to do something
you didn't want to do,

817
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,900
and i should've
been more gracious.

818
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,600
you protecting my honor?

819
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,000
i don't like bullies.

820
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,500
maybe he was right.

821
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,000
oh, i hate him. i hate his
arrogance and his pushing and...

822
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,600
if claudia was my patient, maybe
i'd have done the same thing.

823
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
pushed to ma it work?

824
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
addison...

825
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,500
you saved her life.

826
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,100
look...

827
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,800
if you want to work
with wyatt again,

828
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,300
work with wyatt again.

829
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,300
don't not do it
because of what i say.

830
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,700
you comfortable with that?

831
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,400
i'm not comfortable
thinking that my advice

832
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,100
colors what you say
or, you know, what you do.

833
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,000
hate him for yourself.
or not.

834
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
want to get a drink?
i could use one.

835
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,700
no. i am going to
take my own advice

836
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,900
and decide something
for myself.

837
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,800
come on in.

838
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,900
um...

839
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,100
i wanted to finish
the conversation

840
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
from the elevator.

841
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,100
i, uh...

842
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,200
i meant what i
said, violet.

843
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,300
i like you.

844
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,900
and i'd like for us
to be friends.

845
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,700
and i'm not exactly sure
how one goes about doing that,

846
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,000
because i'd like to get
to know you better.

847
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,700
not go out on a date,

848
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,500
just go out, as friends

849
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,000
and without all that

850
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,600
pressure of sex
and dating and...

851
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,900
i just...

852
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,900
i think we'd
be good friends.

853
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,700
i think you're right.

854
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,700
hey, kevin.

855
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,700
it's me.

856
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,300
yeah, i, um...

857
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,500
i miss you.

858
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:47,500
