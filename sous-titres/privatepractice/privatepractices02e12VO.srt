1
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:16,429
Don't scare the erection.
It's up, Violet. Full mast.

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,042
I thought you just wanted
to be friends.

3
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:20,418
I did, but a week of friendship...

4
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:23,907
it looks like I'm over my issue,so...

5
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:25,418
is... this okay?

6
00:00:28,606 --> 00:00:32,234
This is embarrassing.
I shouldn't have come.

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,567
hold it!

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,529
What's your problem?
You look like someone died.

9
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:50,538
Dying.

10
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:53,270
- Big Daddy.
- Big Daddy?

11
00:00:53,532 --> 00:00:54,952
Well, that is a screen name.

12
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:58,211
When you get back on the horse,
you really get back on the horse?

13
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:01,214
What's killing him, the...
the sex or the cold-fish attitude?

14
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:02,892
Big Daddy's my father.

15
00:01:15,736 --> 00:01:17,540
Kevin's back at my place.

16
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,681
That's good.
That's good.

17
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,891
I don't know. It's just weird.
It's all...

18
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:26,323
negotiation and awkwardness,
but it's fine, it's fine.

19
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:29,582
Sam has a girlfriend.

20
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:31,660
Maya hung out last night
with her at Sam's.

21
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,892
- That's not good.
- No, it's good.

22
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:36,802
It's good.

23
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:42,353
Why do you two look like that?

24
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:44,902
- We're good.
- We're good.

25
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,931
- What?
- Your girlfriend is nice.

26
00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:56,292
- You have a girlfriend? Well, that's...
- Good.

27
00:01:56,377 --> 00:01:58,531
- It's good.
- It's really good.

28
00:02:03,695 --> 00:02:05,570
Who calls their father "Big Daddy"?

29
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,642
I mean, that's like...
it's like "cat on a hot tin roof".

30
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:10,311
It's like...
Charlotte King does.

31
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:12,460
She actually calls her father
"Big Daddy"?

32
00:02:12,638 --> 00:02:15,922
And, you know, he's dying, and,
I made a

33
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:18,183
jerk of myself in front of Charlotte
because I was laughing.

34
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:20,590
- Nice move.
- Should I do something?

35
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:22,163
Walk away, Cooper.

36
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:24,132
Big Daddy is not your problem.

37
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:27,431
you have another kid
that we don't know about?

38
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:28,233
Funny.

39
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:30,912
This is Julian.
It's the C.F. family, Sam.

40
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:32,593
Champ, come here.

41
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:35,673
It is just wrong...
a single father, two kids, and

42
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:37,550
and all of them havecystic fibrosis.

43
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:40,440
And... Julian's father
doesn't sound so good.

44
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:48,342
Hey, you two.
Is it photography day?

45
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:50,152
I got Gracie a camera for her birthday.

46
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:53,020
She's... been taking pictures
of everything.

47
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:57,291
I'm maKing a scrapbook.
It's really great.

48
00:02:57,537 --> 00:03:00,111
When I don't feel good,
it gives me something to do.

49
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:02,171
Well, let's see if we can make you
feel better. Do you want to be first?

50
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,461
I'll keep your dad entertained
with some percussion therapy.

51
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:06,533
- Where you beat me healthy?
- Or we can let Addison

52
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:08,170
do the bronchoscopy lavage.

53
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:10,392
All right, we'll get your labs done,
get you out of hereas soon as we can.

54
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:13,472
- You gonna be okay on your own, kiddo?
- Dad, I'm 9.

55
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:21,801
All right, any dizziness
or slurred speech?

56
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,781
Seth. Will you please tell my son
that I'm fine?

57
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,771
You still have weakness
on your right side

58
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:29,361
and a persistent visual field defect.

59
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:31,110
- I'm concerned.
- Tell her she needs to move.

60
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:34,111
- I'm not moving to Florida.
- I can take care of you there.

61
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:36,601
I can take care of myself here, right?

62
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:39,303
Well, you're still at risk
for another stroke.

63
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:41,591
- You should be with someone.
- Are you ganging up on me?

64
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:44,110
Since dad died,
you barely want to talk on the phone.

65
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:46,073
- That's not true.
- It is.
- It's not true.

66
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:48,252
He thinks I'm depressed.
I'm not.

67
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:50,670
- I have friends. I'm not alone.
- They're not family.

68
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:53,133
- You should be with family.
- This is a Big decision.

69
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:55,883
Deciding to move, up root your life...
it's huge.

70
00:03:56,056 --> 00:03:58,263
But losing a spouse is huge, too.

71
00:03:58,636 --> 00:04:01,003
Do me a favor, Cynthia
speak with our therapist?

72
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,850
It would make me feel
a lot more comfortable.

73
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:11,061
I thought I was okay with it,
but I'm not sure if I am okay with it.

74
00:04:11,638 --> 00:04:14,392
I'm sleeping with two men.
Do I get a lecture now?

75
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:17,620
Yes, you do.

76
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:23,251
This is good.

77
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,460
- This is progress.
- Really?

78
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:28,321
- That's my lecture?
- It's fun, it's exciting, it's...

79
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:30,131
congratulations, man.

80
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:32,530
So you're okay with it?
Because the weird thing is,

81
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,842
I'm okay with it, except for the part
of me that thinks I shouldn't be, but I

82
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:37,922
- I think I am.
- Sex is good.

83
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,562
Relationships are bad.

84
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:43,662
Relationships are what cause people
to be cold and lying and deceitful.

85
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:45,433
I mean, you know.
You're a therapist.

86
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:46,670
Professionally, I would dispute that

87
00:04:46,717 --> 00:04:48,511
and suggest that you need
to see your own therapist.

88
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:50,012
But personally?
Yes.

89
00:04:50,086 --> 00:04:52,553
As a red-blooded american,
sex is your birthright.

90
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:55,382
Go forth, enjoy...
guilt-free.

91
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:58,321
I will.
I will exercise my right.

92
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:02,541
- Sorry to interrupt.
- The C.F. results are back.

93
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,512
How bad?

94
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:11,191
If this... is... if this is serious,
if I'm gonna die, please just

95
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:13,821
- tell me now.
- Daron, your tests came back fine.

96
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:15,580
It's... it's Gracie.

97
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:18,722
She tested positive
for burkholderia cepacia.

98
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,552
- It's a bacteria that gets in...
- yeah, I know what it is.

99
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:25,012
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:28,293
It's gotta be some kind of a mistake.
I mean, she looks fine. Look at her.

101
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,071
You're not gonna tell me that her lung
function's gonna start going down hill.

102
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:33,900
From her test results,
it appears that it already has.

103
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:37,902
You know how contagious this bacteria
can be for C.F. patients.

104
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:40,693
It's a miracle that
you and Julian haven't caught it.

105
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:43,231
What we need to do now
is get Gracie to the hospital,

106
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:45,870
get her into isolation
while we figure out what to do.

107
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:46,970
Okay. All right.

108
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:51,272
- I'll... take her there now.
- No, Daron, you can't take her.

109
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:54,890
You can't touch her,
you can't be with her or you'll die.

110
00:05:57,488 --> 00:06:01,890
<i>Private Practice S02E12
Homeward Bound<i>

111
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:04,892
I'm not being stubborn.

112
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:07,813
I don't want to move.

113
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:10,702
Moving to a new city
at any age is stressful.

114
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:14,162
But just for a minute,
let's look at the other side.

115
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,650
Could this move be good for you?

116
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,732
I can't move.

117
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:25,072
And I can't talk to him about
why I can't move. And...

118
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:28,453
he's not going to take no
for an answer.

119
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,661
and now...

120
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:34,131
now he has Sam on his side.

121
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:37,482
Well, you can talk to me.

122
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:43,911
If Seth finds out the truth,
he's going to hate me.

123
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:46,743
Cynthia, anything you tell me
stays with me.

124
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:49,331
Let me help you.
Talk to me.

125
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:52,850
You can't even...

126
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:55,741
you can't even tell Sam.

127
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:02,090
If I can't come near you,
how are you gonna take care of me?

128
00:07:02,528 --> 00:07:04,812
Well, we'll fiomre sething out, honey.
Okay? I promise.

129
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:09,253
But for right now, you're gonna have to go
to the hospital with Dr. Freedman, okay?

130
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:17,810
She needs me.

131
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:20,651
You can't put yourself at risk,
or Julian.

132
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:23,082
If either of you gets exposed,
this will kill you.

133
00:07:23,185 --> 00:07:24,891
So I just leave her alone?

134
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:27,280
Isn't there a family member
you could call,

135
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:29,210
someone who could help you,
who could be with Gracie

136
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:32,391
I got a sister in Nashville,
but she doesn't really know Gracie.

137
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:35,153
Look, Gracie needs me.
Okay? I need her.

138
00:07:36,786 --> 00:07:40,362
She's already lost her mother, you know?
I'm... all she has.

139
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:42,601
Look, I could wear a mask, right?

140
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:44,403
We, you know, we could take precautions.

141
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:47,462
Daron, if you live together,
you will get this,

142
00:07:47,537 --> 00:07:49,072
and there is no way we can treat it.

143
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:51,530
Well, I need to be there
for both of them.

144
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,462
You know, they both need me.

145
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,551
how am I supposed to choose?

146
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,214
- I'll be back.
- Okay, take care.

147
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:15,222
Hey, how's... how's Gracie

148
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,633
You know, not good. She's trying to be
brave, but she doesn't like the hospital...

149
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:20,950
And I don't think
that she really understands

150
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:22,320
that not seeing her dad or her brother,

151
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:25,273
not living with them, that's permanent.

152
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,393
What were you talking
to Charlotte about?

153
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:31,802
She asked me to do her neonatal rounds
while she goes to Alabama to see her dad.

154
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:34,883
What, like you owe her a favor
after what she did to us?

155
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,202
Cooper, her father is dying.

156
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:50,270
 I'm sorry about your dad.

157
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,931
- If there's anything you need...
- I'm fine.

158
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:54,670
I see death every day on the job.

159
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:56,961
It's a part of life,
and I'll deal with it.

160
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:58,673
I'm late for my flight.

161
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,333
Cynthia is fully capable
of making decisions about her own care.

162
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,682
And you're not at all concerned that
a 70-year-old woman

163
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:10,683
still recovering from a stroke is putting
herself further at risk by living alone?

164
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:13,541
Sam, you asked me to evaluete her.
So she's not depressed,

165
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:15,970
she is not clinging irrationally
to her independence.

166
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:19,372
She has legitimate reasons
for what she's doing.

167
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:21,681
- Which are?
- Privileged.

168
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:31,481
I think it's confusing to Maya,

169
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:33,981
meeting a woman
that you've just started to date.

170
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:37,741
- What?
- I think meeting a new girlfriend
could be... scary for her.

171
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:39,830
Do you have a problem with Sonya?

172
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:45,633
You date who ever you want. Just... 
think about how this affects Maya.

173
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:01,470
That was almost the high light
of my day.

174
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:02,952
Not in the mood.

175
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:04,633
Cute kid.

176
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:09,013
What? I can't feel for a patient?

177
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,700
Try me.

178
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:13,693
9 year old with cystic fibrosis patient.

179
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:15,641
Rare bacterial infection in her lungs.

180
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:18,351
Father can't be with her anymore
because he has C.F., too,

181
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:20,172
same thing with her 2-year-old brother,

182
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:24,052
because if ither of them get infected
with the bacteria, they'll die. So,

183
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:25,780
father has to choose...

184
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:28,833
let his girl die alone or 

185
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:33,163
stay with her and leave a 2 year old
with C.F. behind.

186
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:36,451
Burkholderia cepacia?

187
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:38,833
What?

188
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:41,360
I had cancer patients manifest the same

189
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:43,753
bacterial complications
as those with B. cepacia.

190
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:46,292
I've had success eradicating
the infection.

191
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,971
Okay, no one in the world has found
a cure for cepacia syndrome,

192
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:50,481
but you're gonna pitch me one?

193
00:10:50,547 --> 00:10:53,950
I know cancer's a lot different
than cystic fibrosis,

194
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:57,153
and the bacteriais more drug resistant.
I just...

195
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:00,970
it's a tragic story.

196
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:04,173
- Worth a shot.
- Why would you help me?

197
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:05,581
I'm a doctor.

198
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:09,932
So...

199
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:14,373
I've spoken to your mother,
Seth, and...

200
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:17,093
she is not ready to move.

201
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,760
Seth, please, you won't listen to me.

202
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:22,982
- Listen to her.
- She understands your concerns.

203
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:25,892
She has agreed to come in
for weekly checkups with Sam

204
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:29,760
and counseling with me and to put
a medic alert system in her house.

205
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:33,623
And if her condition worsens,
then we can always revisit this.

206
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:34,943
I promised...

207
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:38,683
I promised dad...

208
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,773
I would take care of you.

209
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:47,061
Most of my friends, the idea
of a parent moving in is terrifying.

210
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:48,191
We want you.

211
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:50,382
It's not like I want
to put you in a home.

212
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:52,781
- Stop pushing me.
- Then help me understand.

213
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:54,952
You hate the city. You hate the traffic,
you hate the crime...

214
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:56,082
Talk to me.

215
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:58,272
- Easy, Seth.
- I think I need a...

216
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,052
Get an ambulance, please.

217
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:07,783
Is she having another stroke?

218
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:11,910
It was a transientis chemic attack...
press...

219
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:15,460
- a warning sign for a stroke.
- It happened because I got upset.

220
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:17,230
That's all.
I am fine.

221
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:21,310
- You're not a doctor.
- Your doctors are saying
you're not fine.

222
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:26,863
- Hey, I came as soon as I could.
- I'm fine. Everyone is making a fuss.

223
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:28,623
You're not fine.
Hi, Annette.

224
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:31,402
Thank you for coming. Listen,
can you just wait outside?

225
00:12:31,515 --> 00:12:32,853
We're discussing things
with the doctors.

226
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:35,582
She can stay.
I want someone on my side.

227
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:39,310
It's not about sides.
I'm sorry. I'm... I can'T...

228
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:44,480
I'm moving you out.
I... I'll get a lawyer if I have to.

229
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:47,390
Talk to him.
Talk to your son.

230
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:49,710
He'll understand.

231
00:12:49,797 --> 00:12:51,653
Violet, what's... going on?

232
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:54,731
She's right.
It's gotta be better than this.

233
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:05,422
I'm... I'm not alone.
I have someone here...

234
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:11,561
who... who loves me and who wants
to take care of me. And...

235
00:13:11,818 --> 00:13:14,102
I was afraid to tell you because...

236
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:17,732
I love you, too, and I...

237
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:21,111
- I'm afraid you won't understand.
- Understand what?

238
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:29,110
I have someone.

239
00:13:33,965 --> 00:13:35,540
Your mother's in love.

240
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:38,433
She has someone here
that she doesn't want to leave,

241
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:40,362
and she was afraid to tell you.

242
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:55,400
You've gone along I get that since dad's
been gone, it'been confusing, and...

243
00:13:55,478 --> 00:13:58,222
and you need to have somebody here
with you. This is not who you are.

244
00:13:58,308 --> 00:14:00,091
Seth, this isn't a reaction
to your father dying.

245
00:14:00,147 --> 00:14:01,832
I'm not talking to you.

246
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:06,233
This is just some...
grief-stricken, crazy reaction.

247
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:09,311
We've been together for years.

248
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:14,723
When you were with dad?

249
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:18,691
- I am so sorry.
- You cheated on dad with her?

250
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:36,472
You wanna catch a movie after?
Just... get away from it all?

251
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,341
I can't. C.F. research to do.

252
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:41,460
Begins the day, ends the day.

253
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:43,553
I've got a little girl
who's about to die, Kevin.

254
00:14:43,598 --> 00:14:46,241
It's hard to think about going out
and relaxing.

255
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:49,803
Well, you could a called.
You... could a said don't come over.

256
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:52,201
- You wanted me to cancel?
- You're giving me attitude.

257
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:52,840
I'm here.

258
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,623
There are other things
I could be doing.

259
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:56,982
I get a lot of invitations...
my friends, women...

260
00:14:57,038 --> 00:14:59,190
So what, you want to date other women?

261
00:14:59,827 --> 00:15:02,543
Maybe I do, but I don't.
I'm not.

262
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:05,970
Because this is so much fun.

263
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:12,350
What hapened to us?
I mean...

264
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:17,570
there was a time when you'd eat noodles
off my naked body. What...

265
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:20,531
what happened to us?

266
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:27,431
Look, I'm sorry.
I thought...

267
00:15:27,608 --> 00:15:31,352
I... usually think that
honesty is for the best.

268
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,761
Well, I knew at 15.

269
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,360
But... back then...

270
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:41,971
that was not what you did.
You...

271
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:45,461
found a guy, got married, had kids.

272
00:15:47,856 --> 00:15:49,182
And I loved him.

273
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:51,093
I did.

274
00:15:53,677 --> 00:15:55,402
And then I met Annette.

275
00:15:56,898 --> 00:16:00,523
You know, our kids were the same age,
and she was...

276
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:05,983
I couldn't stop myself.

277
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,893
Well, you were honest with yourself.

278
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:12,350
That's...

279
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:15,131
that's sometimes the hardest piece.

280
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:19,551
He's got to understand, right?
I mean...

281
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:23,002
- once he gets over the shock?
- He loves you.

282
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:25,602
He... wanted to do
what was best for you.

283
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:28,131
He'll come around.

284
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:35,120
Electrons that detach
and move around are called...

285
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:38,501
- Atoms?
- Free electrons.

286
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:42,052
Why are you being so nice to me?

287
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:44,611
Ten's he last time you gave me answers
without torturing me first?

288
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:46,933
I just know you...

289
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:49,193
didn't have a chance
to study last night.

290
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:53,031
What do you want to know about her?
Sonya?

291
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:54,491
I wasn't...

292
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:57,792
- How was last night?
- It was fun.

293
00:16:58,215 --> 00:16:59,880
It wasn't... uncomfortable?

294
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:02,063
Because, you know, you do not have
to hang out with your dad

295
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,592
and his new girlfriendif you don't want to.

296
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,303
I like her mom,
and dad really likes her.

297
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:08,742
You'd like her, too,
if you got to know her.

298
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:11,133
Don't worry about me.
Dad's just having fun.

299
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:13,090
You should have fun, too.

300
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:16,412
You need to get a life.

301
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:26,332
I can't stop thinking about you.

302
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:39,993
She loved Sonya.

303
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:45,213
And why shouldn't she? She's smart,
she is pretty, and she is fun. I mean, she ...

304
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:49,420
she brings over movies and popcorn,
and I, I just... I do homework.

305
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:52,130
Nai, you're her mom.
You're supposed to do homework.

306
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,710
And Sonya is being fun because
she's trying to make a good impression.

307
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:58,201
That's what happens
when things are new.

308
00:17:58,306 --> 00:18:00,032
You go out of your way to be nice.

309
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:02,200
Look at me and Kevin,you know?

310
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:04,690
Not so new, not so nice anymore.

311
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:06,633
That sounds like marriage.

312
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,232
You gonna end it?

313
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:12,601
Hey... I've been through all
of Wyatt's research.

314
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,203
It's pretty convincing.

315
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:17,561
He had an idea... to help.

316
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:20,150
Let's go find Pete and Coop.

317
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:28,383
So... I could get her back?

318
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:30,663
It's a long shot, 
but we'd like to try.

319
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:32,420
It's not gonna hurt? I mean,
I don't want anything to hurt her.

320
00:18:32,468 --> 00:18:34,312
Her lungs are already full,
so we have to clear them.

321
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:36,893
So it's the same procedure.
We just take a sample of the bacteria.

322
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:39,062
We know that it worked on cancer.

323
00:18:39,237 --> 00:18:42,473
We are hoping... really hoping...
it can help Gracie.

324
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:48,511
You know, she loves horses.
Her whole room is horses.

325
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:53,120
You know, I thought if she had these here
in her room, that she'd feel more...

326
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:00,271
I don't know. I'll... go call her.
I'll tell her maybe.

327
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:08,071
Delivery for Ms. Gracie Rousakis.

328
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:17,063
He's worried about me.
I don't like it when he worries.

329
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:19,183
Well, you know, he's your dad.
It's his job to worry.

330
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:20,592
Tell him I'm fine.

331
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,223
Make him stop worrying about me.

332
00:19:23,657 --> 00:19:25,692
Since mom died, he's done everything.

333
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:29,220
And when he starts worrying,
he starts coughing,and then...

334
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:31,853
You need to tell him I'm fine.

335
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:34,690
It's okay if you miss him.

336
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:38,841
I want my dad.

337
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:54,291
- We got your page.
- You've got to give her something.

338
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:56,140
Seth hasn't come back or called.

339
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,611
- She can't stop crying.
- We'll prescribe some lorazepam.

340
00:19:58,707 --> 00:20:02,401
What you need to do is call Seth
and get him back. Tell him...

341
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:05,192
tell him she'll go with him to Florida.

342
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:08,613
I love you more than anything,
but you need your son

343
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,083
and you need your grand children
more than you need me.

344
00:20:12,306 --> 00:20:14,831
Please. Talk to him.
Tell him she'll go.

345
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:16,651
Just get him back here.

346
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:23,220
I just want you to know
that your dad's outside waiting.

347
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:24,741
He wanted to let you know that
he's here.

348
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:25,820
What about Dr. Cooper?

349
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:27,671
He's gone for the day,
but you don't have to worry.

350
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:29,713
I am gonna take good care of you.

351
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:33,051
Once you're asleep, I'm gonna use this
to clean out your lungs.

352
00:20:33,147 --> 00:20:35,633
You'll feel much better.
See? Who's that?

353
00:20:37,455 --> 00:20:39,113
Then we're gonna give dell some of
what we took out

354
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:42,531
to give to Dr. Montgomery and
Dr. Lockhart to test the antibiotics on.

355
00:20:42,706 --> 00:20:45,473
I know it's scary, but when you wake up,
it'll all be over.

356
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:46,662
I just...

357
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:49,483
I hope it works.

358
00:20:57,405 --> 00:21:00,103
Now we just need one of these
to stay clear,

359
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:01,893
and then we'll know
that the bacteria is sensitive

360
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:04,080
to that combination of antibiotics.

361
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:06,730
By morning we should know,
one way or the other.

362
00:21:06,838 --> 00:21:09,053
- Want to grab a bite?
- Actually, I am starved,

363
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:10,913
but I am supposed to...

364
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:13,712
meet someone.

365
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,572
- The cop.
- Yes, the cop.

366
00:21:17,396 --> 00:21:20,230
So you really think a hot date
and fine dining is better than a guy

367
00:21:20,318 --> 00:21:23,321
you can barely stand
and cafeteria mac and cheese?

368
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:27,271
I do love... the mac and cheese.

369
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:33,712
From a psychophysiolical stand point,

370
00:21:34,018 --> 00:21:36,461
- this is remarkable.
- What is?
- You.

371
00:21:36,637 --> 00:21:40,203
What you do to me. All day
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

372
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:42,160
And ever since you called...

373
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:54,312
I remember this tasting a lot better.

374
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:56,440
I don't know.
It takes me back.

375
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:58,213
To residency, you know,
when life was simple.

376
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,530
See, I have a hard time picturing
you as an intern, taking crap

377
00:22:00,597 --> 00:22:02,360
- from your attending.
- By year two, they all hated me.

378
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,240
It took them that long?

379
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:05,271
sorry.

380
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:08,842
It's just... yeah,
they really hated me.

381
00:22:10,046 --> 00:22:11,271
so'd my wife.

382
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,262
- You're married?
- Was.

383
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:17,922
The divorce took 2 years, 4 lawyers,
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

384
00:22:18,098 --> 00:22:21,881
We... discussed assets, property,
money, the dog.

385
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:24,541
But not once...

386
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:28,063
in all that time
did anyone ever ask me about love.

387
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:34,103
I'm still bitter...

388
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:35,870
about the dog.

389
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:38,213
I get what bitter does.

390
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:41,103
You have all that love, and then...

391
00:22:41,488 --> 00:22:43,390
- where does it go?
- You, too?

392
00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:45,213
Member of the club.

393
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:50,722
So I'm gonna ask this again, but
this time, pretend you think I'm human.

394
00:22:51,885 --> 00:22:54,501
You want to maybe have dinner with me
sometime?

395
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:56,982
- A date?
- I...

396
00:22:58,145 --> 00:22:59,531
don't think that's a good idea.

397
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:02,533
Is it 'cause it's me or
because of the cop?

398
00:23:06,647 --> 00:23:07,891
Think about it.

399
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:25,491
I am not here.

400
00:23:26,745 --> 00:23:30,122
This is not jealousy.
This is concern for my daughter.

401
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:35,813
Remember when Maya told you...
remember when Maya told you to get a life?

402
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:38,423
I have a life.
I have a... great life.

403
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:42,403
I'm just standing here on my patio
in the dark spying on your ex,

404
00:23:42,577 --> 00:23:44,822
his girlfriend and your daughter.

405
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:55,733
I'm being replaced.

406
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:59,992
Sonya is my replacement.
That's Maya's new mommy.

407
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:07,883
I am freaking... oh,god.
Ignore me. Ignore me.

408
00:24:07,986 --> 00:24:10,372
I'm just freaking.
Thank you.

409
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,363
Why aren't... you out with Kevin?

410
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,420
It's not like we're married.

411
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,641
I don't have to be with him every night.

412
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:24,260
I don't have to call or check in,
and if I want to talkto another man,

413
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:27,660
it's not like we have promise rings
or anything.

414
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:30,682
Who is it, this other man?

415
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,100
Wyatt asked me out on a date.

416
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:39,960
He's...

417
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,793
different than I thought.

418
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:44,532
Okay, well... 

419
00:24:45,128 --> 00:24:48,890
can I just say that... you're
in a relationship, so, you know...

420
00:24:49,348 --> 00:24:51,943
- knees together.
- No,I am not a cheater.

421
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:54,822
Okay, I've done that.
I'm not gonna do that again.

422
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:58,162
I don't know. But I do want to say
yes to the date.

423
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,041
I just... I don't know. Should I?
I shouldn't. Should I?

424
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:03,103
We are so screwed up.

425
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,323
This is a nice place.

426
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:21,302
Crazy humid.

427
00:25:38,368 --> 00:25:39,451
Lung cancer.

428
00:25:40,127 --> 00:25:43,321
Doctors gave him six months
two years ago.

429
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:46,931
He went into respiratory failure
last week.

430
00:25:47,677 --> 00:25:49,191
How you holdin' up?

431
00:25:51,145 --> 00:25:52,212
Let's see...

432
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:56,552
Duke and Landry are downing bourbon,
mom has taken to her room with the vapors,

433
00:25:56,636 --> 00:25:59,352
and not a one of 'em wants any part
of making a decision about Big Daddy.

434
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:00,512
The vapors?

435
00:26:01,137 --> 00:26:02,582
You have a medical degree
from Johns Hopkins.

436
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,142
You've diagnosed your mother
with the vapors.

437
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,712
She's a drug addict.

438
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:08,791
But here in Dixie,
we're more polite about it.

439
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:14,730
- What?
- Why are you her, Cooper,

440
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:17,071
in the middle of my southern
gothic tragedy?

441
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:18,732
I came for you.

442
00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:28,253
Landry was supposed to pull the plug
this morning, couldn't do it.

443
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:31,421
Duke can't even come in the room.

444
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:34,671
- So it's just you.
- Just me.

445
00:26:36,485 --> 00:26:39,073
He's not even there anymore.
It's just...

446
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:42,873
the ethical, moral,
medically correct thing to do.

447
00:26:43,588 --> 00:26:45,083
Pull the plug and...

448
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:46,951
it's done.

449
00:27:00,025 --> 00:27:02,413
- Are you okay?
- No, not really.

450
00:27:04,376 --> 00:27:08,540
So I've been having sex,
lots and lots and lots of sex.

451
00:27:08,615 --> 00:27:12,240
- Yes, with Pete.
- And with Sheldon, many times.

452
00:27:12,418 --> 00:27:14,681
Many, many...

453
00:27:15,126 --> 00:27:16,250
many times.

454
00:27:18,976 --> 00:27:20,302
and I'm in pain.

455
00:27:20,945 --> 00:27:23,872
- And I can't stop peeing.
- You need Addison.

456
00:27:24,606 --> 00:27:27,713
You've got honey moon cystitis
from too much sex.

457
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:31,372
So I will prescribe you an antibiotic
and something for the pain.

458
00:27:31,428 --> 00:27:34,392
Violet Turner, I am your friend,
and I know you.

459
00:27:34,535 --> 00:27:37,231
Sleeping with Sheldon and Pete
is not you.

460
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:38,423
Come on.

461
00:27:38,465 --> 00:27:41,043
When Cooper does it, he gets a slap
on the back and an attaboy,

462
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:43,180
but when I do it...
when a woman...

463
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,880
takes control of her sexuality,
she's a whore.

464
00:27:45,996 --> 00:27:48,200
You are just not that person.

465
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:50,000
Something is going on here.
I mean...

466
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:53,880
I don't know, you're avoiding something
or in denial. Something psychological.

467
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:55,443
I don't know. You're the therapist.
You know.

468
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:57,470
And you know this is not good.

469
00:27:57,585 --> 00:28:01,362
Wouldn't it be better just to figure out
which one you want to be with?

470
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:03,902
How can I choose?
I mean, Pete is...

471
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:06,461
Pete's all heat.

472
00:28:06,637 --> 00:28:08,760
I just see him, and I melt.

473
00:28:08,935 --> 00:28:12,043
- And Sheldon is comfort.
- Like mac and cheese.

474
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:13,093
What?

475
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:15,470
Do you think this is okay,
what she's doing?

476
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:19,021
I think that it's hard
to figure out who the right person is.

477
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:19,973
Thank you.

478
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:22,043
Yeah, I mean, Kevin's great, but,
you know, I mean, is...

479
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:24,370
is he the one or is it someone else?

480
00:28:24,668 --> 00:28:26,780
I want to be okay with this
Sonya thing. I do, I do.

481
00:28:26,847 --> 00:28:30,423
But I don't think I care that Sam
is dating, but do I care?

482
00:28:30,557 --> 00:28:33,201
Am I in denial?
No, this is about Maya, right?

483
00:28:33,305 --> 00:28:35,373
I'm not crazy. This is about Maya.
I'm not crazy.

484
00:28:35,468 --> 00:28:37,863
Does this really look like
the time for therapy?

485
00:28:45,928 --> 00:28:48,492
- Thanks for coming in.
- I just came to pick up my laptop.

486
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:51,313
- I left it yesterday when I ran out.
- Your mother needs you.

487
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:55,570
She is willing to move all the way
to Florida if that's what you want.

488
00:28:55,837 --> 00:28:57,442
Think about it, Seth.

489
00:28:57,796 --> 00:28:59,852
Think about what's best for her.

490
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,073
The only thing I've been able to think
about this how stupid I was

491
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:03,382
not to have fired this out.

492
00:29:03,428 --> 00:29:06,720
She wanted to tell you. She was just
afraid that you wouldn't accept her.

493
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:07,910
You know, it's not about accepting her.

494
00:29:07,957 --> 00:29:10,203
You think I can't accept that she's gay?

495
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:12,280
I've known Annette my whole life.

496
00:29:12,368 --> 00:29:14,380
Now it's like I'm...
replaying every moment,

497
00:29:14,456 --> 00:29:16,172
every christmas, every thanksgiving.

498
00:29:16,265 --> 00:29:19,791
You know, I was in the backyard
playing football and they were...

499
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:22,182
- fooling around.
- You don't know that.

500
00:29:22,238 --> 00:29:24,413
Do you think I want to think about it?

501
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:25,811
And my dad?

502
00:29:26,805 --> 00:29:28,631
She was everything to him.

503
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,780
She be trayed him.

504
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:33,880
She be trayed us.

505
00:29:34,587 --> 00:29:35,783
You're a father.

506
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:38,730
You've gotta know
how difficult it is to be a parent.

507
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:44,262
You love your kids, so you want to do
everything you can to protect them.

508
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:48,453
So you try to figure out
what's right to tell them and

509
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:52,201
what's right to keep from them. And
sometimes you don't get it right, but...

510
00:29:52,377 --> 00:29:55,390
you know, you do your best
because you love them.

511
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,661
You think it would've been better if

512
00:29:57,735 --> 00:30:00,601
your mother had left your father
when you were a kid?

513
00:30:01,225 --> 00:30:03,401
She was just trying
to keep the family together,

514
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:05,933
trying to give you the mother
that you wanted.

515
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:08,782
I don't know her.
I feel no connection to that woman

516
00:30:08,836 --> 00:30:12,203
- because I don't know her at all.
- She is your mother.

517
00:30:13,026 --> 00:30:15,423
She would give up everything for you.

518
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,180
Don't you think she has given up enough?

519
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:29,731
I'm almost afraid to come in here.

520
00:30:29,818 --> 00:30:32,323
We just need one dish
without bacterial growth.

521
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:34,363
You make it sound so simple.

522
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:56,471
So that's what it looks like
inside of her lungs.

523
00:30:56,948 --> 00:30:58,470
It was a long shot.

524
00:30:58,576 --> 00:31:00,681
You had to try.
We had to try.

525
00:31:01,835 --> 00:31:04,390
- I don't think we should have dinner.
- Why?

526
00:31:04,477 --> 00:31:07,593
Why, because of me or
because the miracle didn't work?

527
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:09,651
I don't know.

528
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,863
Sam just left for St. Ambrose
if you're looking for him.

529
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:32,523
Thank you.
I guess patient trumps lunch.

530
00:31:34,598 --> 00:31:38,652
Look ... we didn't really get a chance
to talk the other night, and...

531
00:31:38,928 --> 00:31:41,630
- I just wanted to...
- No, look, you don't have to.

532
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:43,720
It's me who should say something.

533
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:46,661
I know it must have been weird, seeing me
hanging out with your daughter.

534
00:31:46,777 --> 00:31:49,270
I remember what it was like
when my mom dated.

535
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:51,641
It's... fine.

536
00:31:51,716 --> 00:31:54,752
Well, you know, I just want you
to know that...

537
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:56,751
wherever this is heading

538
00:31:56,837 --> 00:31:59,692
with Sam, I want to be
really careful about Maya's feelings.

539
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,811
I got burned a few times, so...

540
00:32:01,946 --> 00:32:02,973
I get it.

541
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:04,972
Well, thank you.

542
00:32:05,348 --> 00:32:06,760
That's... very...

543
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:09,170
thank you.

544
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:11,462
You're very nice.

545
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,182
Well, so are you.

546
00:32:18,975 --> 00:32:23,103
Big Daddy always said cancer was just
his chickens coming home to roost

547
00:32:23,366 --> 00:32:25,283
'cause he didn't believe in tears.

548
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,291
If he ever cried,
he did it in private.

549
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:29,492
Cancer was just his chickens...

550
00:32:31,835 --> 00:32:34,110
payback for being a son of a bitch.

551
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:37,190
And he was

552
00:32:37,508 --> 00:32:38,810
a son of a bitch

553
00:32:39,637 --> 00:32:40,910
to everybody...

554
00:32:41,988 --> 00:32:43,382
everybody but me.

555
00:32:44,057 --> 00:32:45,902
He loved me being a doctor.

556
00:32:46,518 --> 00:32:48,521
He loved that I didn't just...

557
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:52,240
marry some boy and
have a bunch of babies.

558
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:56,512
He would've killed me for marrying
a son of a bitch of my own.

559
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:58,062
'Cause he knew...

560
00:32:58,547 --> 00:33:00,672
what that would've been like for me.

561
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,452
But if I'd have stayed...

562
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:05,693
married some boy and had babies,

563
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:08,751
I would've been here.

564
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:14,660
When he got sick, I would've been here
to take care of him.

565
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:16,971
So...

566
00:33:17,805 --> 00:33:19,502
these aren't his chickens.

567
00:33:19,635 --> 00:33:23,842
These are my chickens, 'cause now
I'm the doctor in the family,

568
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:26,631
and I know what has to be done.

569
00:33:43,726 --> 00:33:45,811
I can do this.
Shut up.

570
00:33:47,328 --> 00:33:50,132
I can do this.
I can do this,damn it.

571
00:33:50,725 --> 00:33:51,672
I can...

572
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:32,593
That's that.

573
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,480
It's okay to cry.

574
00:34:41,088 --> 00:34:42,121
it's not.

575
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,113
- Daron, I'm sorry.
- Nothing?

576
00:35:01,856 --> 00:35:04,801
Well, we knew it was a long shot,
but I'm sorry.

577
00:35:04,976 --> 00:35:07,343
I can't even go in there to tell her.

578
00:35:08,437 --> 00:35:09,573
I'll do it.

579
00:35:23,507 --> 00:35:24,443
I can't.

580
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:27,642
I want my dad.

581
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:29,572
Pete's gonna handle this.
He'll take care of her.

582
00:35:29,635 --> 00:35:31,452
I can't... I can't do it.

583
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:35,322
here.

584
00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:38,861
Here are the keys to my house.
All Julian's clothes...

585
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:41,143
and his toys are in his room, okay?

586
00:35:41,488 --> 00:35:42,422
Just...

587
00:35:45,006 --> 00:35:47,860
just make sure that...
he knows why I did this...

588
00:35:47,918 --> 00:35:50,593
- Don't d...
- and that they take care of him.

589
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:53,433
- No, Daron...
- You can't do this.

590
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:56,493
I will not let my daughter
go through that alone.

591
00:35:56,636 --> 00:36:00,162
- But, Daron, if you go in there...
- I love my son, okay?

592
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:03,920
But I love my daughter.

593
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,570
- He's not coming.
- I can try to talk to him again.

594
00:36:39,668 --> 00:36:41,821
- Maybe he just needs more time.
- It's my fault.

595
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:46,042
I tried to keep it separate...
who I was, who I loved.

596
00:36:46,588 --> 00:36:50,383
You are who you are, and you shouldn't
have to hide that from anybody.

597
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:51,671
I love you.

598
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:07,283
I made it all the way out
to the airport,

599
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:09,831
but I couldn't get out of the car.
I just...

600
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:13,992
sat there for an hour
in the rental car return l'm...

601
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:17,933
I'm still trying to understand this.

602
00:37:18,518 --> 00:37:20,443
I know you took care of us.

603
00:37:21,736 --> 00:37:23,532
Dad was happy.
I was happy.

604
00:37:25,207 --> 00:37:27,531
I guess it's your turn to be happy.

605
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:31,431
You should...
stay here with Annette.

606
00:37:31,907 --> 00:37:32,802
I'll...

607
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:34,920
I'll... I'll visit.

608
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:38,720
Maybe sometime, we'll visit.

609
00:37:39,987 --> 00:37:41,192
I'd like that.

610
00:38:06,407 --> 00:38:09,513
Daron gave up on his son.
Just...

611
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:12,480
walked away from him.

612
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:16,411
Well, it was an impossible choice
to make. It's hard to fault him.

613
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:19,131
The reality of Gracie dying
was right in front of him.

614
00:38:19,218 --> 00:38:23,583
The idea of Julian having to bury him
or not be with him,

615
00:38:24,556 --> 00:38:26,063
it's just too abstract.

616
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:28,170
I just wanted to...
I'm sorry.

617
00:38:30,036 --> 00:38:31,960
I didn't mean to interrupt a conference.
I just

618
00:38:32,068 --> 00:38:34,930
wanted to know if you wanted
to come over later.

619
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,570
You're going over to his house?

620
00:38:39,147 --> 00:38:40,830
I'm sorry. Is there a...

621
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:50,351
Okay, look... 
Pete, Sheldon, I am...

622
00:38:51,076 --> 00:38:52,942
I'm sleeping with both of you.

623
00:38:53,337 --> 00:38:56,700
I thought it was okay,
but it's not.

624
00:38:56,878 --> 00:39:00,412
I realize that...
you... you just can't do that.

625
00:39:00,808 --> 00:39:02,682
I can't do that.
And...

626
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:05,991
and I'm sorry.

627
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:14,292
Who are you?

628
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:21,412
He's right.

629
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,112
I'm a mess.

630
00:39:33,186 --> 00:39:34,590
We're all a mess.

631
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:37,373
Don't you know that by now?

632
00:39:39,936 --> 00:39:42,540
All I know is,
don't mind finding out...

633
00:39:44,418 --> 00:39:45,551
who you are.

634
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,202
- I was... just coming to see you.
- Yeah?

635
00:39:58,836 --> 00:40:01,043
I just wanted to say that...

636
00:40:02,378 --> 00:40:05,393
I feel I have a responsibility
to our daughter...

637
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:08,851
for her to know who I am,

638
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:10,922
good or bad...

639
00:40:11,585 --> 00:40:14,713
but even if that means
telling her who I'm dating.

640
00:40:15,648 --> 00:40:18,351
I never want her to not know
who I am.

641
00:40:18,528 --> 00:40:21,342
I'm gonna say this,
and I know how it sounds.

642
00:40:21,946 --> 00:40:23,911
Maya likes her better than me.

643
00:40:24,086 --> 00:40:25,802
She's your daughter, Nai.

644
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:28,752
You are her mother.
She doesn't like Sonya better.

645
00:40:30,107 --> 00:40:31,510
Sonya's just new.

646
00:41:22,577 --> 00:41:24,772
I don't know what I'm doing here.
