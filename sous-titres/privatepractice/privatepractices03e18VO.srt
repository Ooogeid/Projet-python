1
00:00:02,301 --> 00:00:05,503
The three fetuses are just too
much for your body to handle.

2
00:00:05,537 --> 00:00:09,737
They're 20 weeks. A few more, and
they'll be viable. I can't lose my wife.

3
00:00:09,772 --> 00:00:11,968
How long have you been sick?
I was diagnosed eight years ago.

4
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:13,135
Does naomi know? No.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,123
The sex didn't have to mean
we were a happy couple again,

6
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:18,538
But it had to mean something. That moment
has passed. We can move on with our lives.

7
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:20,760
I don't want to see you.
he has a right to be mad.

8
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:21,919
You told him you
couldn't be with him

9
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:25,039
And you started sleeping with me. But you
are not the ex-husband of my best friend.

10
00:00:25,074 --> 00:00:27,855
I was coming up here to tell
you what happened to me today,

11
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,128
But it seems like all the
real action is up here.

12
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:06,328
He's still here.

13
00:01:06,363 --> 00:01:08,230
I can't even imagine.

14
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:10,599
Your wife decides
to be a surrogate,

15
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:12,534
And she ends up in a coma,

16
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:14,503
Pregnant with someone
else's triplets.

17
00:01:14,537 --> 00:01:16,672
He won't go home.

18
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:19,742
He just sits there, talking to her.

19
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:21,243
It's awful.

20
00:01:21,277 --> 00:01:23,312
He loves her. Addison...

21
00:01:23,346 --> 00:01:26,415
I have to check on the fetuses.
Addison, it's not my fault.

22
00:01:26,449 --> 00:01:29,318
You could've kept your mouth shut.

23
00:01:29,352 --> 00:01:31,186
She saw us. She knew.

24
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:34,590
There was nothing to see. Nothing happened.
When you-- nothing happened, really?

25
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:36,859
So there's--there's nothing
for naomi to be mad about?

26
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:39,862
We never-- she saw what she
saw because it was there.

27
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:42,865
Now maybe you're afraid to act on it,
but it was there.

28
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,834
So what are you saying,
that it would be better if we had--

29
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,003
I mean, if you and I
had slept together,

30
00:01:48,037 --> 00:01:50,506
You're saying it would be okay that naomi
is mad? Then at least we could be together

31
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,509
Instead of whatever this is.
Okay, I don't know what she is to you,

32
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:56,612
But she is important to me.
She's my--she's everything.

33
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:58,747
So then what am I?

34
00:01:58,782 --> 00:02:01,617
You... Have a girlfriend,
and I have pete.

35
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:04,119
So we are nothing. I have to go.

36
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:09,391
Eddie.

37
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,062
You should eat something,
have some coffee.

38
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,700
We fought about it, you know...

39
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:20,602
Her doing this

40
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:22,304
Carrying these babies.

41
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:25,808
I told her I didn't want her to.

42
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:28,677
I told her that we could
manage without the extra money.

43
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:31,280
Eddie, it's not your fault.

44
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:34,917
I was already working two jobs,
and we were just scraping.

45
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:38,454
She wanted to help.

46
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:41,423
she agreed to be a surrogate,
you know, not a--

47
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,158
An incubator. I'm so sorry.

48
00:02:43,193 --> 00:02:45,327
You know, what-
what if she's aware?

49
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,930
I mean, what-
-what if she's in pain?

50
00:02:47,964 --> 00:02:49,398
Look at her.

51
00:02:49,432 --> 00:02:51,633
Look at her.

52
00:02:51,668 --> 00:02:54,336
She's in limbo, I'm... In hell,

53
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,472
And my kids are a wreck,

54
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:59,074
And all of you just sit around hovering
and--and waiting

55
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:01,977
Till you can empty her
out and throw her away.

56
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:03,912
It's not right.
Eddie, come with me, okay?

57
00:03:03,947 --> 00:03:05,881
Let's get some food or some coffee.

58
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:08,016
Just some fresh air. No.

59
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:09,451
You need a break.

60
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:12,054
She wouldn't want this,
to be like this.

61
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:15,958
I want to pull the plug.

62
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:20,863
I can do that, right?

63
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:25,901
Transcript by Addic7ed.com

64
00:03:27,637 --> 00:03:30,005
He wouldn't just be
pulling the plug on kayla.

65
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,741
What about the babies she's carrying?
I understand the suation.

66
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:35,777
And it doesn't horrify you? The fetuses
aren't viable outside of the womb.

67
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:38,514
Eddie asked me to explain
the process to him,

68
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:41,350
Not second-guess his moral judgments.
Well, there are two people down the hall

69
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:43,952
Who are the parents
of those babies.

70
00:03:43,987 --> 00:03:46,221
They should have a say.
I'm sorry kayla's in a coma.

71
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:48,624
But she's not in any pain,
and if you really think

72
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:50,926
It's somehow more humane
to euthanize her than to

73
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,296
Keep her alive long enough to bring three
babies to term-- okay, the time to stop this

74
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,832
Was before you convinced
kayla to roll the dice. You--

75
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:59,234
Calm down, the both of you.
Now we are where we are.

76
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,136
Even though none of
us are comfortable

77
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,106
With what eddie wants,
addison is right.

78
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,174
We're obligated to honor it.

79
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,677
Kayla's only one of the
patients in that room.

80
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:11,246
There are three others,

81
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:13,181
And someone needs to protect them.

82
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:15,484
I'm gonna talk to angie and simon.

83
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:19,454
You'd be killing three babies. How can you
not understand that? You killed my wife.

84
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:22,524
Do any of you give a damn about that? All
right, could we all just take this into the
hall?

85
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,793
We asked eddie to talk outside.

86
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:28,764
He wouldn't leave kayla. I'm sorry. I would
give anything if this hadn't happened.

87
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:32,434
Kayla is a wonderful person.
She's given us everything.

88
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:34,803
But she wanted to do this, eddie.

89
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:37,739
She wanted to carry these babies. You know
she did. She never wanted to live like this.

90
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:39,241
Listen to that thing.

91
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:41,443
It shoves air into her
and it sucks it out.

92
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:43,979
She's hooked up to this,
this, a-all this crap.

93
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:46,882
That's not life.
I want her to have peace.

94
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,618
She will. Now!

95
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:54,623
I mean, I knew it was time
to move out of naomi's house,

96
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:57,159
But betsey hates the new
apartment. I hate it.

97
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:59,194
The carpets are beige.
The walls are beige.

98
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:01,597
The neighborhood is beige.
My whole life is beige.

99
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:03,365
Uh-huh. Do you ever
feel like you're,

100
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,167
You know, like,
just treading water?

101
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:07,836
Nothing's moving forward.
You're standing still.

102
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,006
Everybody else-- no, I don't.
Here's some free advice.

103
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,709
Kindergarten's over.
Training wheels are off.

104
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:16,311
Nobody's gonna catch
you if you fall.

105
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:18,714
If you don't like your life,
you do something about it.

106
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:20,415
You reach down,

107
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,651
You pull one foot out of the mud,
then the other.

108
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:24,920
You walk away from it.
You can't walk, you crawl.

109
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:27,789
You do something. Join a gym.
Join a club. Join a cult.

110
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:29,391
Do something, anything.

111
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:31,693
What you don't do is
whine to me about it.

112
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:40,481
What?

113
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:43,048
Addison is heartbroken
you won't speak with her.

114
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,451
I'm not gonna talk about it.

115
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:48,154
If you want to talk about work,
that's fine.

116
00:05:48,188 --> 00:05:50,789
Okay. Well, lucas is sick.
The nanny just called.

117
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:52,958
She's sick now, too, so I gotta go.

118
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:56,295
I'll probably be out a day or two.
Okay, whatever you need.

119
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:58,430
Pete.

120
00:05:58,465 --> 00:06:01,100
I hope the little guy feels better.

121
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:02,735
Thank you.

122
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,674
Okay, I-I-I know we should
talk about the kissing.

123
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,709
And I haven't been avoiding you.

124
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:13,112
I haven't. It's just that, uh...

125
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:14,780
I'm seeing william, and I--

126
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:17,816
William's out of the country.
Switzerland, on business.

127
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:20,953
No, he's not. No.
We have a date tonight.

128
00:06:20,987 --> 00:06:23,889
It's canceled.

129
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:25,824
He left? For how long?

130
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:28,928
He didn't say. And he told you?

131
00:06:28,962 --> 00:06:31,864
Wow.

132
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:33,999
That's great.

133
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:36,268
Yeah, that's just...

134
00:06:36,303 --> 00:06:38,237
Great.

135
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,905
Naomi.

136
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:48,380
This is the money I owe you for
the buy-in on the practice.

137
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:51,884
I know I was kind of a
jerk about it at the time,

138
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,120
But thank you. Thank you for floating me.
You sure you can afford it?

139
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:57,590
Yeah. I'm good.
I've been putting money aside.

140
00:06:57,624 --> 00:07:00,125
Didn't want the debt
hanging over me.

141
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,295
I never made an issue of it. Wasn't about
the money. Yeah, money's usually about
something else.

142
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,798
What's that supposed
to mean? Nothing.

143
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:07,800
You lent me money.
I'm paying you back.

144
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:10,970
I'm trying to be a grown-up.
I feel good about it. Is violet back?

145
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:12,938
Because this whole grown-up
thing sounds like--

146
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:16,575
She's not back.
I'm growing up all on my own.

147
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,411
Take the check.

148
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:25,951
Is this the last thing between us?

149
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:27,953
Don't make it more than it is.

150
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:30,623
You're the one who said
money's not about money.

151
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:33,325
Sometimes it is.

152
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:51,577
What are you doing?

153
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:53,779
Charlotte, this isn't the--

154
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:56,115
Shut up, sheldon.

155
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:04,657
How long till the
babies are viable?

156
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:07,960
Six, seven weeks. Look,
if you would just give us that.

157
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,828
No. mr. Lindy.

158
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:12,064
I'm charlotte king,
hospital chief of staff.

159
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:13,866
Thank you for coming.

160
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,402
Uh... I have a medical
power of attorney,

161
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:19,171
And I want to take my
wife off of life support.

162
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:21,640
She's carrying our babies.
Now I told you what I want--

163
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:24,343
We got a lawyer.

164
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:25,878
Look...

165
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:28,414
We didn't want this to
become a legal thing,

166
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:30,783
But now... Maybe it has to.

167
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:32,951
You don't have the right.
actually, mr. Lindy,

168
00:08:32,986 --> 00:08:34,920
A judge will have to decide that.

169
00:08:34,954 --> 00:08:37,156
I suggest you get an
attorney of your own.

170
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,824
But she's my wife.

171
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:40,859
I know that, and I'm so sorry.

172
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:44,163
But as of right now,
I need everyone out of this room.

173
00:08:44,197 --> 00:08:45,597
I'm not leaving.

174
00:08:45,632 --> 00:08:48,300
You are. Till this is legally
resolved, I have to act.

175
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:51,103
Essential medical personnel
only in this room.

176
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:53,072
I-I'm not leaving my wife alone.

177
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:56,408
I'm not keeping my kids
from seeing their mother.

178
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:58,777
I really am sorry.

179
00:08:58,812 --> 00:09:02,081
how did you let this happen?

180
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,168
I want to help him somehow.

181
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:15,170
Well, there's nothing we can do.

182
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:18,140
It's a legal thing, not medical.
We're out of it.

183
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:21,877
It's just horrible. There are no-
-no good options. Sometimes, it's--

184
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:26,681
Just let her go. No. Nai.

185
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:29,785
Sam and I never meant to
have feelings for each other.

186
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,720
It just happened.

187
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:33,855
But it never went
anywhere because of you.

188
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,691
Please don't be mad at me. mad?

189
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:39,194
Nai.

190
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:41,429
Did you ever love me?

191
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:42,864
Don't be ridiculous.

192
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,766
Was I second choice?
When did all this start?

193
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,902
When--when we were
in med school? No.

194
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:49,237
Wh-when you were maid
of honor at my wedding?

195
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:51,039
It's not like that, naomi.

196
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:54,042
It is like that.
I-I can't stop wondering.

197
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:56,778
Everything is tainted with this.

198
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,047
He--he is the father

199
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:01,583
Of my child, addison,
and there's a bond there,

200
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:03,685
And maybe I shouldn't expect
you to understand that.

201
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:07,389
But you don't get friendship? That's
why we backed off, naomi, friendship.

202
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:09,691
God, I... I'm second-guessing

203
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:12,694
Everything that has ever
happened between us.

204
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:16,665
I've lost every good
memory of our marriage...

205
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,567
And of our friendship.

206
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:22,003
No, no, I am not mad.

207
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:25,273
You two have...

208
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:27,475
Broken my heart.

209
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:34,816
pete?

210
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:37,085
in the kitchen.

211
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,954
Left his special blanket here.

212
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:40,889
I thought it would
help calm him down.

213
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:42,691
Oh. Are you sick? Oh.

214
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,693
Aw, you have a fever.
Oh, yeah, stay away.

215
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,695
You don't want this. Trust me.

216
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,630
I-I felt fine a
couple of hours ago.

217
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:51,433
Oh, you shouldn't have to take
care of him when you're sick.

218
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:53,435
Yeah, well, it doesn't
work that way. It's my job.

219
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:55,837
You know what? let me help.

220
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:58,273
I'll take care of him.
You guys have stuff here.

221
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:01,309
Just go upstairs and go to sleep.
Are you sure? He's got a fever.

222
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:02,944
He's gonna be cranky.

223
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:05,280
My house, my rules.
I'm a baby doctor.

224
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:07,983
we will be fine.
All right? Go to bed.

225
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:09,985
Thank you.

226
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,586
Huh? Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

227
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:16,691
Binge eating.

228
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:19,060
Oh, just shut up.

229
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,062
william leaving
gets you that upset?

230
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,565
No. There are a lot of things.
There are--

231
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,501
There are a lot of things
that are wrong at once.

232
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:28,470
Do you want to talk about it?

233
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:31,473
No. What I want is for this
to make me feel better.

234
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:34,042
Put the chocolate down and
come here. Oh, gabriel--

235
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,645
<i>Chocolate down now.</i>

236
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,818
What?

237
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:47,055
Come here.

238
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:50,859
Sit down. No--

239
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,894
<i>Sit down.</i>

240
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:16,851
Mm.

241
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:25,393
Now isn't that better
than chocolate?

242
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:31,066
So, um, why are you here
instead of dr. Montgomery?

243
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,235
She has someone sick at home.
The baby just hit eight months.

244
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,705
I was hoping she'd tell me it
was time to get off the couch

245
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:38,673
And just let the baby
come when it comes.

246
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,642
Bed rest is starting
to make me crazy.

247
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,345
Well, maybe I can tell you
that after I do the exam. Okay.

248
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,146
You're really young, aren't you?

249
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,582
How long since you got
out of med school?

250
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:49,617
I'm not a doctor. I'm a midwife.

251
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:52,687
<i>Is she really unavailable?</i>

252
00:12:52,722 --> 00:12:54,856
Can we call her?

253
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,292
okay. Yeah.

254
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:59,661
Just explain to her that you
have to check her cervix.

255
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,696
If it's dilated,
send her to the hospital.

256
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:04,032
If not, just check
again tomorrow, okay?

257
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:07,369
No, I know all that.
Uh, she just wanted to consult you.

258
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:10,305
Can't we just reschedule?
! No offense.

259
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:14,943
come on, baby. Try to relax.

260
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:19,180
Uh, addison, uh, is everything okay?
He's just been up all night.

261
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,750
I can't... Get him
to be comfortable.

262
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:23,618
I'm good with babies, dell.

263
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:25,987
I am. It's my job to
be good with babies.

264
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:28,023
But I cannot get him comfortable.

265
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,457
Huh? Come on.

266
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,426
Addison, addison,
just--just hold him.

267
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,661
You know, talk softly to him,

268
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:36,431
Let him feel your heartbeat and
smell your presence... Yeah?

269
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:38,433
And, uh, listen to your voice.

270
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,635
Just talk to him calmly,
smile at him, and just,

271
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:42,837
You know, keep doing
that till it works.

272
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:44,172
Sometimes with a sick baby,

273
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:46,141
It's not so much
about doing something

274
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:48,476
As being something.
Being something. Okay.

275
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:50,645
Okay. Thanks, dell. Bye.

276
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,651
Wow. You're good.

277
00:13:56,685 --> 00:13:59,754
Check whatever you need to check.

278
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,261
Thank you.

279
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:10,498
Am I not allowed to
sit in the hall now?

280
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:12,467
I know you won't believe this,

281
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,936
But I hate this as much as you do.

282
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,972
No... You don't.

283
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:19,774
You can't.

284
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:22,710
Have you talked to anyone?
Someone who could help you.

285
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:24,679
Help me what, fight them?

286
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:26,081
I've called three lawyers.

287
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,050
All of 'em want money
that I don't have.

288
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:32,687
They all say that it'll
take time that I don't have.

289
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:35,690
You won't even let me be
in there with my wife.

290
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:38,026
All of you say that kayla...

291
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,161
Doesn't know that I'm there.

292
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:45,733
But I know that she does.

293
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:53,274
This is an attorney at
a nonprofit aid group.

294
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,178
Tell 'em I referred you.

295
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:02,484
Why are you helping me?

296
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:04,152
Just call.

297
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,100
Sometimes you surprise me.

298
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:21,069
I have a role at the hospital.

299
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:23,471
Doesn't mean I don't feel for him.

300
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,341
So you want him to pull the plug?

301
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,410
He's sitting there alone.
I know what that's like.

302
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:31,246
Yeah. Okay.

303
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,148
Don't look at me like that.

304
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,750
I have feelings just
like a real person, sam.

305
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:38,253
He's alone. He has to
stare through a window

306
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:41,156
At someone who just
isn't there anymore.

307
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,224
He needs it to be over.
At any cost?

308
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:44,726
I'm not saying he's right.

309
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,296
I'm saying he deserves to be heard.

310
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:01,802
You're saying I need
to keep lying here.

311
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,737
Probably for another
couple of days.

312
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:06,607
I'd like to come back tomorrow
and recheck you if that's okay.

313
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:10,144
Worst part is, I can't
even take care of my kid.

314
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,180
Megan, she's 4.
She should be home any minute.

315
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:15,616
I sent her to school
with a cough today,

316
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,118
'cause if she was here,
I would've gotten up and...

317
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:21,455
She looked at me with these eyes,
said she was fine.

318
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:23,424
Yeah, I know the look.
You have kids?

319
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,659
A daughter, 8.

320
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,962
I thought I could do it all,
you know--

321
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:31,031
Mother, provider, super woman.

322
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:34,601
But now I'm like a
sick kid on the couch.

323
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:36,804
I'm moving backwards.

324
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,041
Bye, emma. Mommy!

325
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:44,011
Hey! Thanks, dena. Hi, pumpkin.

326
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,512
Oh.

327
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:48,916
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

328
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,585
You know, when I come back
to check you tomorrow,

329
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:55,322
I'll--I'll try and rope in our
pediatrician, okay? Thank you.

330
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,731
Oh. You're missing some
buttons there, stud muffin.

331
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:07,434
They're not missing. Oh,
you like getting your shirt ripped off?

332
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:10,671
I can't fight you right now. I have to see
a patient. I'm not looking for a rematch.

333
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:13,073
Your relationship's
none of my business.

334
00:17:13,107 --> 00:17:15,409
Yeah, well, to be clear,
it's not a relationship.

335
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,044
It's just... Sex.

336
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,712
None of my business.

337
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,113
No need to share.

338
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:22,449
Sorry. I don't mean
to be insensitive.

339
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:24,351
I'm just having a good time.

340
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:26,820
I've never had this
much of a good time

341
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:28,622
With a woman before.

342
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:31,892
Again, I'm oversharing,
so I'm just gonna go.

343
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:34,962
What?

344
00:17:34,996 --> 00:17:36,497
You got something to say?

345
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:38,899
No. Nothing.

346
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,371
You don't happen to have
a needle and thread?

347
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:47,441
My shirt--some of the buttons
just fell off. Uh, yeah.

348
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:49,042
Cheap shirt.

349
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,613
Here you go.

350
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:53,747
Thanks.

351
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,449
Mm-hmm.

352
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:58,352
You want to talk about it?

353
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:01,822
Uh, no. You want someone
to eat chocolate with?

354
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:04,591
Are you trying to be funny? No.
I think talking is better.

355
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,327
But since you didn't want to talk--

356
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:11,398
I like to work within someone's comfort
zone. Oh. Well, okay. Uh, chocolate's not
helping.

357
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:13,433
Must be bad. Yeah. yeah.

358
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:16,370
And the worst part is,
the people I would normally

359
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:18,338
Go to to talk about it, I can't.

360
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:21,375
So... Well, you and
I aren't that close,

361
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:23,777
But my door is always open.

362
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,579
Thank you.

363
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:27,714
Actually, most of the time,
it's closed.

364
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:30,417
My clients seem to
prefer it that way.

365
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:33,487
well, look, since you
don't want to talk,

366
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:35,122
Let me just ask you this--

367
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,124
Is there something that
might make you feel better?

368
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,560
I mean, not talking,
not chocolate...

369
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:41,862
Uh, I don't know. Um...

370
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:44,231
Well, I see something.

371
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:46,133
Um... It's fife.

372
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,235
Oh. It's fife, okay?

373
00:18:48,303 --> 00:18:51,204
And... I-I-I don't even
know how I feel about him,

374
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:53,974
But, uh, he kissed me yesterday.

375
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,610
And, uh, well, you asked
if there was something

376
00:18:56,644 --> 00:18:59,346
That would make me feel better-
so go with feeling better.

377
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,315
I-I couldn't. I wouldn't even...

378
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,283
I-I don't even know
what I want, so--

379
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:05,319
What, intimacy is more
wrong than chocolate?

380
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,088
I mean, I think if it makes you feel
better-- yeah, but I-I wouldn't even know
what to do.

381
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:11,224
Because of the chair? Uh,
no, because of everything.

382
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:14,194
But, uh, yeah, I-I guess
the chair does make it

383
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:15,963
A little more confusing.

384
00:19:15,997 --> 00:19:18,298
Oh, god. This is humiliating.
I don't want to talk.

385
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,133
Talking is not good.

386
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:23,170
Okay, okay, I-I understand,
but in terms of the chair,

387
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,839
That particular impediment,
you should talk to charlotte.

388
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,408
She knows a lot about sex.
I can't talk to charlotte.

389
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:30,377
We--no, I-I took her job.

390
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:32,212
We have a mutual contempt. I--

391
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:34,214
But she knows a lot about sex--

392
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:36,283
<i>A lot.</i>

393
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:40,787
And you deserve to feel better.

394
00:19:40,822 --> 00:19:42,856
so... Thanks.

395
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:48,662
okay, lucas, I'm gonna extract
some mucus from your nose.

396
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:50,797
Yeah, you're gonna
feel a slight pinch,

397
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:53,166
But then you're gonna be
able to breathe, okay?

398
00:19:53,201 --> 00:19:56,036
Here we go. No, lucas.
I need you to stay still. Okay?

399
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,972
Oh, gosh. Okay. When you grown up,
you're gonna find out that

400
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:02,109
There's all sorts of things
that you can't fix, but then

401
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:04,645
There are certain things
that you can fix, like this.

402
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,947
And if you just let me,
you're gonna feel so much better.

403
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:09,082
Okay? But I need you to...

404
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:12,319
Oh, lucas, I don't want to kill you.
I just want your snot.

405
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:14,888
he won't be still.
His nose is stuffed up,

406
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,823
And he won't let me clear it.

407
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:18,825
He acts like I'm trying
to suck out his brain.

408
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,761
And he's been crying
since I've been alive.

409
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:23,664
Cooper, how do people do this? Did you
really bring me here to do a bulb syringe?

410
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:25,265
Yes.

411
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,100
Oh, you're a doctor.

412
00:20:27,135 --> 00:20:29,870
Why are you acting like a antic,
first-time parent? You're my friend.

413
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:31,838
Why are you acting like an arrogant

414
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:33,540
And impatient doctor?

415
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:35,108
Bulb syringe.

416
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:38,278
Boop-boop-boop.

417
00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:43,050
Yeah. Shh, shh. Doo-doo-doo-do-do.

418
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,721
Okay.

419
00:20:47,755 --> 00:20:49,890
No, no, no, no, no. He hates me.

420
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:53,126
He's angry and sick. He threw up on me.
And nothing I do helps.

421
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:55,529
I--I've never felt so ineffective.
I don't like it.

422
00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:57,998
Do you think it's because
I'm not his mother?

423
00:20:58,032 --> 00:20:59,966
I mean, do you think he knows,

424
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:02,469
Like, I'm the wrong
person to be doing this?

425
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:05,138
The right person is the
person that's there for him.

426
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:07,641
okay, you put him
in a lukewarm bath.

427
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:10,210
It's gonna feel good on his skin.

428
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:13,346
It's gonna help calm him down.
I gotta go.

429
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:16,049
Coop. Hey, you can do this.

430
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:18,618
You can.

431
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,053
coop.

432
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:26,893
* my love *

433
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:29,396
They're doing well.
Yeah, but he's not.

434
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,566
you say it like you blame me.

435
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,901
No, no, I don't blame you.

436
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:37,204
It's just, this is
the woman he loves,

437
00:21:37,238 --> 00:21:40,774
And he can't be with her because of these
circumstances. He wants to pull the plug.

438
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:43,510
I think that he wants her to be
allowed to have some dignity.

439
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:46,780
And to hell with these babies, right? No,
no, I'm not-- I'm not saying that.

440
00:21:46,814 --> 00:21:48,548
This is about addison.

441
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,451
Okay, th-this is not about-
you know what? I'm fed up.

442
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:53,420
I've watched you through
this entire ordeal,

443
00:21:53,454 --> 00:21:55,689
And not once have owned
that you were on my side.

444
00:21:55,723 --> 00:21:57,858
You did the surgery.
This wasn't all my fault.

445
00:21:57,892 --> 00:21:59,826
There's no side here.
There's no fault.

446
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:02,696
This is people in pain and
not being able to fix it.

447
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,532
All of us should be on
the side of those babies.

448
00:22:05,566 --> 00:22:08,502
So why am I the only one
trying to save three lives here

449
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,705
When everyone else is fighting
for a life that's already gone?

450
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:15,842
*...Say good-bye *

451
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,879
* my love *

452
00:22:20,581 --> 00:22:22,749
You dancing?

453
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:25,652
Oh.

454
00:22:25,686 --> 00:22:27,554
Lucas is sick.

455
00:22:27,588 --> 00:22:29,222
Where's pete?

456
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:32,459
Oh, he's sick, too.
He's in the guest room.

457
00:22:32,493 --> 00:22:34,027
Shh.

458
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,595
How's eddie?

459
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,098
Uh, he's worse.
Hearing is tomorrow.

460
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:40,700
The judge is gonna
come to the hospital...

461
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,202
See the situation in person.

462
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,105
He won't stop crying, sam.
He hates me.

463
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:48,341
Or he could just have a cold.

464
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:51,044
You don't look too good either.
No, I'm fine. I'll be fine.

465
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,013
I just wish...

466
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:55,048
I don't know. I thought
it would be easier.

467
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:59,252
I thought... I thought I'd be better.
Addison, I c--I can't do this.

468
00:22:59,287 --> 00:23:01,454
I-I can't be your sounding board

469
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:02,989
About your life with...

470
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:07,394
Keep me out of it. Wh--

471
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,863
Okay.

472
00:23:11,365 --> 00:23:12,766
okay.

473
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,535
* good-bye *

474
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,537
Thank you again for doing this.

475
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:18,972
Addison wouldn't want her up,

476
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:21,041
And the kid's cough
sounded like hell.

477
00:23:21,075 --> 00:23:23,109
This is my week to do house calls.

478
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:29,082
My mommy--

479
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,451
aah! Ah!

480
00:23:33,855 --> 00:23:36,523
Okay, what happened?
She was coughing,

481
00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:39,726
And I-I-I... I picked her
up and I shouldn't have.

482
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,928
My water broke. (pantsÃfÂ¡

483
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:45,232
The baby's coming. Oh! Ow!

484
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:50,348
Why would you come to me with this?

485
00:23:50,382 --> 00:23:54,486
Well, you're the only sexologist in the
building. There are other buildings.

486
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,188
What's the nature of
the patient's injury?

487
00:23:57,223 --> 00:23:59,090
Uh, it, uh,
is a spinal cord injury--

488
00:23:59,124 --> 00:24:01,726
Uh, lower body paralysis,
only use of one hand.

489
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,462
So he's in a wheelchair. Yeah.

490
00:24:04,497 --> 00:24:07,332
Have he and the new girlfriend
tried having sex yet?

491
00:24:07,366 --> 00:24:14,706
Uh, no. I believe they have kissed,

492
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,441
But, uh, th-that's as far I
could fit 'em in Tuesday.

493
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:19,277
Oh, no, no. I don't think
that they want to come in.

494
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:20,712
They're, um...

495
00:24:20,746 --> 00:24:23,314
Well, she--I think she's
embarrassed to talk about it.

496
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:25,083
Ah.

497
00:24:25,117 --> 00:24:26,584
She's embarrassed.

498
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:27,685
Yeah.

499
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,954
What exactly does she
find embarrassing?

500
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:32,490
Uh, well, you know,
she's... She's never--

501
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:34,459
Why not ask your colleague-
dr. Fife?

502
00:24:34,493 --> 00:24:36,361
Go right to the source,
so to speak.

503
00:24:36,395 --> 00:24:37,862
Think he'd be embarrassed?

504
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:40,265
Are you gonna help
with my patient or not?

505
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:42,267
Sometimes when people need help,

506
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:44,936
They need to own it,
ask for it, be direct,

507
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,005
Instead of beating around the bush,

508
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,673
Using intermediaries.

509
00:24:48,707 --> 00:24:52,644
I want to know about having
sex with dr. Fife, okay?

510
00:24:52,678 --> 00:24:54,279
Are you satisfied?

511
00:24:54,313 --> 00:24:57,448
Oh, yes. Maybe this will
help you get satisfied.

512
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:03,354
It's, uh, all about
the mechanics...

513
00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:06,524
And what the able-bodied person
has to do to make it work.

514
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,992
Hmm.

515
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:10,161
That kind of thing.

516
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,067
Thank you.

517
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:17,869
Naomi.

518
00:25:17,903 --> 00:25:20,972
The question is,
does he do it for you?

519
00:25:21,006 --> 00:25:25,343
'cause if he does,
the wheelchair doesn't matter.

520
00:25:29,448 --> 00:25:31,249
please calm down, lucas.

521
00:25:31,283 --> 00:25:35,219
Please. I know you feel awful,

522
00:25:35,254 --> 00:25:39,290
I have been here for you,
and I'm trying. I really am.

523
00:25:39,325 --> 00:25:40,625
I'm good with babies.

524
00:25:40,693 --> 00:25:43,628
I have always been
good with babies.

525
00:25:43,662 --> 00:25:46,864
I am a baby doctor because
I'm good with babies.

526
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:48,399
Lucas.

527
00:25:48,434 --> 00:25:50,802
Maybe I'm not a mother,
but I wanted to be.

528
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:54,038
I did. I wanted to be a mother
more than you know. Lucas.

529
00:25:54,073 --> 00:25:56,474
come on, lucas.

530
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:58,977
I want to be good,
and I want to understand.

531
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:00,912
What do you want me to do?

532
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:03,381
What can I do to
make you feel better?

533
00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:06,684
Let me make you feel better.
Let me make you feel better.

534
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:08,853
Yeah. Oh.

535
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:10,455
Oh, thank you.

536
00:26:10,489 --> 00:26:13,391
thank you, thank you, thank you.

537
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:15,660
Thank you.

538
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:18,029
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

539
00:26:18,063 --> 00:26:21,432
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

540
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:24,769
Ah! Ow.

541
00:26:24,803 --> 00:26:27,271
Okay, I got megan settled upstairs.

542
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:30,375
Okay? I called 9-1-1.
The paramedics should be here--

543
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:32,043
When?

544
00:26:32,077 --> 00:26:35,013
oh, dell. I should've
been a better patient.

545
00:26:35,047 --> 00:26:38,082
I should've stayed on the cou--ah! Ow! Okay,
okay, okay, listen to me, listen to me.

546
00:26:38,117 --> 00:26:41,085
I need you to push again
on three, okay? Okay.

547
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,154
One, two, three. Aah!

548
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:45,323
aah!

549
00:26:45,357 --> 00:26:47,458
I can't. I can't.

550
00:26:47,493 --> 00:26:49,193
I can't push. Okay, okay.

551
00:26:49,228 --> 00:26:51,295
everything okay?

552
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,898
Uh, the baby's crowning, but, um...

553
00:26:53,932 --> 00:26:56,367
But--but what? But what?!

554
00:26:56,402 --> 00:26:59,570
The b--the baby, he's stuck.

555
00:26:59,605 --> 00:27:00,638
Oh!

556
00:27:00,673 --> 00:27:02,674
Okay. Ohh!

557
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:05,109
I heard from both lawyers
and all the doctors.

558
00:27:05,144 --> 00:27:08,579
And while I'm not eager
to make a legal ruling

559
00:27:08,614 --> 00:27:12,650
In what is clearly so
intensely personal a conflict,

560
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:16,087
Apparently that is the
only way to settle this?

561
00:27:16,121 --> 00:27:17,855
All right.

562
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,159
Although mr. Lindy's
medical power of attorney

563
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:23,895
Arguably exempts him
from culpability

564
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:25,963
Under this state's
fetal homicide ban,

565
00:27:25,998 --> 00:27:27,865
The equities of the situation

566
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,169
Favor the preservation
of three potential lives.

567
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:34,572
Given that the mother,
kayla lindy, isn't in pain

568
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:37,308
And wouldn't suffer an undue burden

569
00:27:37,342 --> 00:27:39,811
As a result of remaining
on life support--

570
00:27:39,845 --> 00:27:43,715
What about our undue burden-- me,
my kids? mr. Lindy.

571
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:45,983
Accordingly, all reasonable efforts

572
00:27:46,018 --> 00:27:48,352
Shall be made to continue mrs.
Lindy's life

573
00:27:48,387 --> 00:27:51,022
Until such time as
the three fetuses

574
00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:53,624
Are viable outside her
body as determined

575
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:57,228
By a competent
medical professional.

576
00:27:57,262 --> 00:28:00,264
St. Ambrose hospital
is hereby ordered

577
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,734
To keep kayla lindy's room closed

578
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:06,270
To all except essential
medical personnel

579
00:28:06,305 --> 00:28:09,474
Until the delivery of the fetuses.
You can't do that.

580
00:28:09,508 --> 00:28:11,542
You can't keep him
away from his wife

581
00:28:11,577 --> 00:28:15,113
For the next two or three months. What's
clear, doctor, is this is emotional and
volatile.

582
00:28:15,147 --> 00:28:17,115
And it is this court's obligation

583
00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:19,484
To protect the health
of those three fetuses.

584
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:28,870
okay.

585
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:30,805
Okay, what's happening?
Please tell me.

586
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,707
Okay, the--the baby's
shoulder's stuck.

587
00:28:32,741 --> 00:28:36,244
I'm--I'm gonna try to shift
the position. Okay? Okay?

588
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:37,612
Okay? Here we go.

589
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:40,448
Ow! Ow! Ugh! What the
hell is going on?! Okay.

590
00:28:40,483 --> 00:28:42,784
The baby's shoulder won't
clear the birth canal.

591
00:28:42,818 --> 00:28:44,986
But the paramedics,
they'll be here soon, right? Yeah.

592
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,256
Right? It'll be okay. The paramedics
aren't gonna get here in time

593
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,825
For you to deliver at
the hospital. Well...

594
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,360
Okay. Okay, what's next?

595
00:28:52,394 --> 00:28:54,996
listen, I'm gonna get
you through this.

596
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,564
Okay? Okay.

597
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,066
Okay. Okay.

598
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,535
Oh, oh.

599
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:17,585
I'm sorry.

600
00:29:23,526 --> 00:29:28,062
We almost never
spent a night apart.

601
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:30,131
Not for anything.

602
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:33,868
And now...

603
00:29:35,504 --> 00:29:38,106
How I can I not be with her now?

604
00:29:40,342 --> 00:29:43,311
She knows how you feel,
eddie. Does she?

605
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:45,313
Does she understand
why I'm not there,

606
00:29:45,347 --> 00:29:48,249
Why I'm not with her?

607
00:29:50,953 --> 00:29:54,088
I tried talking to the judge.

608
00:29:54,123 --> 00:29:57,392
She won't change her mind.

609
00:30:06,068 --> 00:30:08,836
This is great information. Useful.

610
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:10,939
You were not supposed to see this.

611
00:30:10,973 --> 00:30:13,007
I'm so sorry that was on my desk.

612
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:15,710
I'm--I'm very, very sorry.
And I'm... Really humiliated.

613
00:30:15,744 --> 00:30:18,680
Can we just please pretend
like this never happened?

614
00:30:18,714 --> 00:30:20,715
Are you kidding me?
I've never been propositioned

615
00:30:20,749 --> 00:30:22,283
With educational literature before.

616
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:24,919
It's kind of a turn on.

617
00:30:24,954 --> 00:30:28,356
Naomi, if you had questions,
why didn't you just ask me?

618
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,858
W-- I wasn't sure what I wanted.

619
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:34,529
I'm not sure about anything.

620
00:30:34,563 --> 00:30:37,098
I can't tell you how you feel.

621
00:30:37,132 --> 00:30:40,034
But I can tell you how I feel.

622
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:42,503
I like you. I want you.

623
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:45,273
I can have sex.

624
00:30:45,307 --> 00:30:47,175
And if you're interested,

625
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:50,178
We can take a bottle of
wine back to my place,

626
00:30:50,212 --> 00:30:53,047
Make out like teenagers,
see what happens.

627
00:30:54,717 --> 00:30:56,117
It hurts.

628
00:30:56,151 --> 00:30:58,086
I know. It's gonna be okay.

629
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:01,322
She didn't pick up.

630
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:03,558
Okay.

631
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,664
Okay.

632
00:31:09,698 --> 00:31:11,933
So, um...

633
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:14,335
Yeah, uh... Okay.

634
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,872
I want you to press down
just below her belly, hard.

635
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:20,575
And I'll free the shoulder. How?

636
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:23,344
I'll force it free.
You might break the clavicle.

637
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:25,346
Yeah, that's the idea.
You'll break what?

638
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:26,948
You--you--

639
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:29,617
You can't break my baby.
No, no, no, no, sweetie. No.

640
00:31:29,652 --> 00:31:32,754
Dell, you can't intentionally
fracture a clavicle.

641
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:34,722
It's crazy. Yeah,
but it's a real thing.

642
00:31:34,757 --> 00:31:36,457
It's called a wood screw maneuver.

643
00:31:36,492 --> 00:31:38,926
No, I-I know what it's called.
Have you ever performed one?

644
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:41,729
Well, I've seen it done.
Look, we have to get the baby out.

645
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:44,232
You--you want to break my baby?

646
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:46,768
I want to save him.

647
00:31:46,802 --> 00:31:48,569
Let's do it.

648
00:31:48,604 --> 00:31:51,239
All right. Okay.

649
00:31:51,273 --> 00:31:53,341
listen to me.

650
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,843
Everything's going to be okay.

651
00:31:55,878 --> 00:31:59,180
Your baby's going to be fine.

652
00:31:59,214 --> 00:32:02,417
When I tell you to push,
I need you to push.

653
00:32:02,451 --> 00:32:03,518
Okay.

654
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:05,586
Okay?

655
00:32:05,621 --> 00:32:07,088
ready?

656
00:32:07,122 --> 00:32:08,990
Okay.

657
00:32:09,024 --> 00:32:10,591
Push.

658
00:32:15,764 --> 00:32:18,566
Oh. Oh.

659
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,735
come on, milo.

660
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:22,770
Oh, trust me, buddy.

661
00:32:22,805 --> 00:32:24,839
You don't not want to catch this.

662
00:32:24,873 --> 00:32:26,207
Oh.

663
00:32:26,241 --> 00:32:27,809
* good-bye *

664
00:32:27,843 --> 00:32:31,446
* to my santa monica dream *

665
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,613
Hey.

666
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:34,515
*

667
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,651
Wow. You look terrible.

668
00:32:36,685 --> 00:32:38,519
Thanks.

669
00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:41,756
Oh. I brought you some soup.

670
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,158
Chicken noodle? Nope.
Chicken and brown rice.

671
00:32:44,193 --> 00:32:46,227
It's better for you
than the noodles.

672
00:32:48,163 --> 00:32:51,699
So, uh, the judge ruled in
favor of angie and simon.

673
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:53,935
They've barred eddie
from being in the room

674
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:56,003
For the entire pregnancy.

675
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:58,372
Oh. Poor eddie.

676
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:01,275
How you feelin'?

677
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,410
Mm.

678
00:33:02,444 --> 00:33:03,544
Ahh.

679
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:06,647
Like I can't go on
like this much longer.

680
00:33:06,682 --> 00:33:08,416
Well, you got a fever.

681
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,951
*...On the wall *

682
00:33:09,985 --> 00:33:12,787
Yes.

683
00:33:12,821 --> 00:33:14,522
* good-bye *

684
00:33:14,556 --> 00:33:16,424
I've screwed it all up.

685
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,525
What?

686
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:20,962
everything.

687
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:22,330
Ah, you're just sick

688
00:33:22,364 --> 00:33:24,432
And feeling sorry for yourself. Mm.

689
00:33:24,466 --> 00:33:26,200
It'll pass.

690
00:33:26,235 --> 00:33:29,737
I guess.

691
00:33:29,772 --> 00:33:32,940
* you tell me stories *

692
00:33:32,975 --> 00:33:36,410
pete's here, so...

693
00:33:37,913 --> 00:33:40,481
* and the ones... *

694
00:33:40,516 --> 00:33:41,949
Eat your soup.

695
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:44,051
* we left behind *

696
00:33:45,888 --> 00:33:49,490
* and the ones we left... *

697
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:51,926
* behind *

698
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,427
You got it? Yeah.

699
00:33:57,461 --> 00:34:00,396
Just give me one more big push.
One big push. Aah!

700
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:02,532
Yes! Come on. Okay, okay.
It's a boy.

701
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:04,534
Beautiful!

702
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,172
Hey, guy.

703
00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:10,640
Hi.

704
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,609
okay.

705
00:34:12,643 --> 00:34:15,578
Is he okay? Is my baby okay?

706
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:17,680
Is he broken?
Nerve function seems good.

707
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:20,316
There might be a small
crack in that clavicle,

708
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:23,286
But babies heal real fast.

709
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,623
This is gonna be a great
story for you someday, buddy.

710
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:29,292
Dell.

711
00:34:29,326 --> 00:34:31,828
Why don't you give robin her baby?

712
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:33,730
Oh.

713
00:34:33,764 --> 00:34:36,099
Hey.

714
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:38,034
Hi.

715
00:34:38,068 --> 00:34:39,302
Hi.

716
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:43,806
Thank you.

717
00:34:45,843 --> 00:34:48,478
Oh, okay. Oh. Shh.

718
00:34:53,284 --> 00:34:55,585
Here for another consult?

719
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,888
Actually, I was wondering if
you'd like to have dinner later.

720
00:34:58,923 --> 00:35:02,892
Dinner? The two of us? You and me,
like a date?

721
00:35:02,927 --> 00:35:04,827
Yeah, well, I thought
it'd be nice to--

722
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:08,164
We don't have to call it a date.
We can call it an appetizer.

723
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:10,500
Guess what this guy just did.

724
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:14,337
<i>He saved two lives in the field
with no equipment. No fear.</i>

725
00:35:14,371 --> 00:35:16,506
No whining? No whining.

726
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,175
Nice.

727
00:35:22,446 --> 00:35:26,282
You know what? Let's skip
straight to the entrÃfÂ©e.

728
00:35:26,317 --> 00:35:28,117
Charlotte. What?

729
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:29,619
Probably, I'm thinking too much.

730
00:35:29,653 --> 00:35:31,955
My mother always told
me I think too much.

731
00:35:31,989 --> 00:35:34,624
Paul simon wrote a song about that.
You want to or not?

732
00:35:34,658 --> 00:35:37,260
Of course I want to,
but there's a, um,

733
00:35:37,294 --> 00:35:40,997
I'm not sure--you know,
when you--when you try to--

734
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:42,899
Good god, sheldon. Just say it.

735
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,801
You're still in love with him.

736
00:35:44,835 --> 00:35:48,404
You're trying to bury your feelings
with mindless sex and-- and?

737
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:50,173
And it's a bad idea.

738
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:52,775
It's a bad idea not to be lonely?

739
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,477
No, but it's unhealthy for you

740
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:56,412
When what you really want is him.

741
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:58,414
You should talk to him.
I mean, I don't know

742
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:01,084
If you and cooper can
work out your problems--

743
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:03,620
You know what? Eat by yourself.

744
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:10,393
Manual?

745
00:36:10,427 --> 00:36:13,196
We don't need no stinkin' manual.

746
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,265
It was amazing.

747
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:17,900
And I was out of practice.

748
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,444
I should go.

749
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:29,679
What?

750
00:36:29,713 --> 00:36:30,813
Oh.

751
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,981
What?

752
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:34,851
I don't know what I'm doing.
What am I doing?

753
00:36:34,885 --> 00:36:36,819
What--what must you think of me?

754
00:36:36,854 --> 00:36:38,755
I mean, william's
gone for five minutes,

755
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:41,391
And I just jump into bed with you?
I'm not complaining.

756
00:36:41,425 --> 00:36:44,727
No, this is not who I am.
This is not what I'm like, really.

757
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:46,696
I mean, just to-- to be a cheater.

758
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,899
I'm a cheat-y cheater,
and I hate cheaters.

759
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:52,168
Hmm?

760
00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:55,438
I should end it.

761
00:36:55,472 --> 00:36:58,041
With william, I should...

762
00:36:58,075 --> 00:37:00,943
I should. I don't want to
be that kind of person.

763
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:03,980
Oh, what does--what does
william need with me anyway?

764
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:06,115
He's... Rich

765
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,852
And he's older and... Busy and...

766
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:11,321
Dying.

767
00:37:13,123 --> 00:37:14,490
What?

768
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:17,060
He went to switzerland
for treatment.

769
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:19,796
He has a.L.S. He's dying.

770
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:23,966
I figured you should know

771
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:27,403
Before you break up with him.

772
00:37:27,438 --> 00:37:29,939
* lay down *

773
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:32,942
oh, my...

774
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:36,446
* I can see you cry *

775
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,683
* away your life *

776
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:42,485
* fall *

777
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:45,588
* like you fell from grace *

778
00:37:45,622 --> 00:37:48,091
* soft but sweetly say *

779
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,062
* this is my dying day *

780
00:37:53,097 --> 00:37:55,598
* and if you don't mind *

781
00:37:55,632 --> 00:37:57,367
* I would like to *

782
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:58,668
* fly *

783
00:37:58,702 --> 00:38:00,803
* fly far away *

784
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:03,506
* that's all I want to do is... *

785
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,309
The nurse is on break.
The door's unlocked.

786
00:38:06,343 --> 00:38:08,478
* fly far my way *

787
00:38:08,512 --> 00:38:10,046
* that's all I'm gonna do *

788
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,415
* on my dying *

789
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:15,017

* live *

791
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:20,390
* like you never have *

792
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:23,126
* take in all you can *

793
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,595
<i> </i>

794
00:38:25,629 --> 00:38:28,498
* before the wind decides *

795
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:30,600
* to lead *

796
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:33,603
Hi. I need your first
flight out to geneva.

797
00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:36,406
* don't let go of my hand *

798
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,274
Thank you.

799
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:40,943
* on my dying day *

800
00:38:40,978 --> 00:38:43,246
* and if you don't mind *

801
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,748
* I would like to *

802
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:47,116
* fly *

803
00:38:47,151 --> 00:38:48,951

805
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:53,089

806
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,458
* fly in my own way *

807
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:57,493
* where nobody can touch me *

808
00:38:57,528 --> 00:38:58,961
* nobody can *

809
00:38:58,996 --> 00:39:00,797

810
00:39:00,831 --> 00:39:03,065
* flying my own way *

811
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:06,402
* that's all I want to do *

812
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:08,638
* on my dying day *

813
00:39:08,672 --> 00:39:11,240
Oh.

814
00:39:11,275 --> 00:39:13,409
* I'm shaken by the cold *

815
00:39:14,912 --> 00:39:17,513
Mm. Mm. Nice.

816
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:18,948
What?

817
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,451
Hand on my face.

818
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:23,352
Mm. Cool.

819
00:39:23,387 --> 00:39:24,454
Mm.

820
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:25,655
Mm.

821
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:26,823
Good.

822
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:30,059
Mm.

823
00:39:30,093 --> 00:39:32,161
My head feels funny.

824
00:39:32,196 --> 00:39:33,229
Mm?

825
00:39:33,263 --> 00:39:35,431
Like a balloon...

826
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:36,899
A helium balloon.

827
00:39:36,934 --> 00:39:38,167
Oh.

828
00:39:38,202 --> 00:39:40,603
where's lucas?

829
00:39:40,637 --> 00:39:42,538
He's in his crib. Mm.

830
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:44,774
I finally calmed him down.
I did it.

831
00:39:44,808 --> 00:39:46,943
Mm.

832
00:39:46,977 --> 00:39:48,978
Go back to sleep.

833
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,780
okay.

834
00:39:50,814 --> 00:39:52,915
Mm.

835
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,852
I love you, violet.

836
00:39:55,886 --> 00:39:57,420
* where nobody can touch me *

837
00:39:57,454 --> 00:39:58,955

840
00:40:04,261 --> 00:40:06,195
sam. Hey.

841
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,831
* my dying day *

842
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:11,067
I'm sorry.

843
00:40:11,101 --> 00:40:13,002
About yesterday.

844
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:16,772
I--mm, this case has
got me all... Mm--I...

845
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:18,841
I didn't mean to
take it out on you.

846
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:21,277
Okay. Well,
I'm good if you're good.

847
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:23,546
I'm good.

848
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,983
Well, maybe... You
could come over later.

849
00:40:27,017 --> 00:40:29,385
Well--

850
00:40:29,419 --> 00:40:31,621
Oh, my god. He's
disconnected the ventilator.

851
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:33,523
How did he get in there?

852
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:36,392
The door's locked.
Eddie, open up the door!

853
00:40:36,426 --> 00:40:38,728
Eddie, open up the door!
What the hell?!

854
00:40:38,762 --> 00:40:41,430
Sam!

855
00:40:41,465 --> 00:40:43,399
Watch out. Watch out.

856
00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:47,236
Get outta the way!

857
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:50,306
Get the ventilator.
We need to reconnect her.

858
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,975
Sam. Sam. Pulse ox is going up.

859
00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:58,447
What's happening?

860
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:01,742
She's breathing.

861
00:41:01,777 --> 00:41:02,618
*

862
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:04,861
On her own.
