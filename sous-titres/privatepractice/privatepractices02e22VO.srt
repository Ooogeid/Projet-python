1
00:00:09,772 --> 00:00:11,552
Well, I'm glad
you're thinking about it.

2
00:00:11,783 --> 00:00:12,833
No. Just...

3
00:00:12,993 --> 00:00:13,992
breakfast.

4
00:00:14,117 --> 00:00:16,409
We won't discuss it now, but
I am looking forward to hearing

5
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:18,000
where you are on my offer.

6
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:20,575
- We're still having dinner tonight?
- I'll be there.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,500
Good.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,100
Come on in.

9
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:33,924
He's meeting with everyone...

10
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:36,790
- everyone except me.
- You have a contract.

11
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:39,125
- He can't push you out.
- I'm trying to talk to you about

12
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:40,549
what's going on.

13
00:00:40,677 --> 00:00:43,129
- It's Violet... again.
- Grasshopper!

14
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,410
- Cooper.
- Grasshopper!

15
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:49,771
You grasshoppered me, right?

16
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:51,781
It's the baby...?
It's the bug...? The bug...

17
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:53,530
Okay... so now we're gonna breathe?

18
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,021
We're gonna breathe now.

19
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:57,420
I know, I know. This is your case.
I am not hovering.

20
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,113
I just wanted to see how she's doing.

21
00:00:59,236 --> 00:01:00,361
We're gonna find out.

22
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:02,220
- This is it, Pete.
- It's happening.

23
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,770
Not happening today.
No cervical dilation.

24
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:08,443
- You're not in labor, Violet.
- What? I am a doctor.

25
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:11,500
- I know labor when I feel labor.
- You... know psychosis. But...

26
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,482
- labor, not so much.
- Addison?

27
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:16,133
He's right. I gotta go.
I gotta go prep another patient.

28
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,652
This chicken is cooked.
This bug is ready to be served.

29
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:23,663
This baby boy has got to get out of me.
I am a week overdue.

30
00:01:25,207 --> 00:01:26,251
You just...

31
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:29,633
you have to give him a little
more time. He'll be here.

32
00:01:32,486 --> 00:01:33,430
The baby!

33
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:36,291
- Is it here?
- It's a false alarm.

34
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,943
I brought this. Kids love pigs.

35
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:44,502
That's really sweet, Sheldon.
I'm sure he's gonna love it.

36
00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:56,993
<i>Private Practice S02E22
Yours, mine and ours</i>

37
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:02,202
Well, you two are having fun.

38
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:05,710
We're just comparing notes...
same checkups, same implantations,

39
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:06,762
same symptoms.

40
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:08,163
Why don't you come on back,

41
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,651
and we'll go over your C.V.S. results?
And, Zoe, you'll be next.

42
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:13,133
Take your time.
I'm waiting on my husband.

43
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:17,990
God, that feels good,
whatever that is.

44
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,212
Good.

45
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:21,123
Good. Do it more.

46
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:23,723
- So you're feeling better?
- What do you mean?

47
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:25,822
Since your loss.

48
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:27,511
My loss?

49
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:31,612
- The baby. The miscarriage.
- Oh, that. No, I'm fine.

50
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:33,113
I'm doing great.

51
00:02:33,248 --> 00:02:34,041
So...

52
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:37,510
Dr. Turner's been helping you
through your grief?

53
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:38,442
Grief?

54
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:40,581
What grief?
There's no grief.

55
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:42,232
I mean, there was, but...

56
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:43,822
but there isn't anymore.

57
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:45,603
I just changed my way of thinking.

58
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:47,300
It's a celebration, really.

59
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:48,453
I made life.

60
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,012
I mean, yes, the baby died,

61
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:52,223
but that doesn't change the fact
that life was made,

62
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:54,843
which is the real miracle,
making life.

63
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:56,890
I mean, labor's hard.

64
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,663
It... hurts and...

65
00:02:58,797 --> 00:03:00,613
and at least
I don't have to go through that.

66
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,671
Katie, I'm really glad
you're feeling better,

67
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:06,092
but recovery is an ongoing process,
and it's important for you to remember

68
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:08,781
to follow the regimen that
Dr. Turner and I laid out for you.

69
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:10,461
That means taking your medications,

70
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:13,410
because with your history
of mental health issues,

71
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,913
you don't want to backslide

72
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:16,291
into delusions.

73
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:19,503
Look at me, Dr. Wilder.
I am smiling again.

74
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:25,803
- So he's fine?
- Yeah.

75
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:28,610
I keep calling it a "he"
because of Vic.

76
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:29,923
He really wanted a boy.

77
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:31,903
You know, someone to carry
on the family name.

78
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:33,822
Not that he wouldn't
have loved a girl, too.

79
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,942
I like to think he's watching
from heaven.

80
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:36,933
Oh, he is.

81
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:39,730
This was your dream, right?
This is what you and Vic wanted.

82
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:41,953
He'd want you to have this baby.

83
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:47,450
I'll... be right back in one second,
okay? Just give me a minute.

84
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:48,571
What's up?

85
00:03:56,198 --> 00:03:58,282
Okay, that's it. Cerclage is out.

86
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:00,671
Hard part's over.
You can deliver anytime now.

87
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:03,693
- Dizzy.
- Oh, that's...

88
00:04:03,816 --> 00:04:05,302
probably a mild stress reaction.

89
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:08,040
Just stay here for a couple of hours
and rest until it subsides.

90
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,012
I'm gonna go back to the hospital,
check on some patients, and I'll

91
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:12,840
pick you up in a few hours, okay?

92
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:23,082
Thanks for...
for everything.

93
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:30,273
I saw that.

94
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:33,083
I saw the way you looked at him,
the way he looked at you.

95
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:35,902
- Morgan, I...
- Are you sleeping with Noah?

96
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:40,863
Morgan just asked me point-blank
if I was sleeping with Noah.

97
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:43,191
I mean, I told her no, I'm not,
because I'm not.

98
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:44,970
I'm barely in the same room since...

99
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:48,132
- What? What? What?
- I was just in with Amelia Sawyer,

100
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:50,833
and I started going
over the C.V.S. results,

101
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:53,693
and the baby tested positive
for the beta thalassemia trait.

102
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:56,153
- That's just a marker.
- I know, but Amelia isn't a carrier.

103
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:58,301
And neither was her husband.
We screened.

104
00:04:58,435 --> 00:05:02,600
And... so I checked the I.F. records
to see who else I implanted that day.

105
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:05,170
I implanted Zoe Salter that morning.

106
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,350
Zoe is a carrier
for beta thalassemia.

107
00:05:09,718 --> 00:05:10,760
Oh, my God.

108
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:12,552
- How?
- I don't know.

109
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,633
- How?!
- I don't know how. I don't know. But...

110
00:05:16,057 --> 00:05:20,151
Amelia's embryo is inside of Zoe,
and Zoe's embryo is inside of Amelia.

111
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,191
They're carrying each other's baby.

112
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:28,991
- You switched them?
- This is a disaster.

113
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:30,951
Wait a minute.
Why assume it was my fault?

114
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:33,313
You're the one who delivers
the syringes for the implantations.

115
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:35,903
You've been walking around here
unfocused, not giving a damn.

116
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:38,193
There are steps to the process,
okay? Multiple steps.

117
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:39,980
And in the end, Naomi injects them.

118
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:42,292
I'm not saying it was you.
I'm not saying it was you.

119
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:44,210
I'm just saying, we don't know.

120
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:52,621
Hey, he's right.

121
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:55,352
I am the doctor.
Ultimately, this is my responsibility.

122
00:05:55,486 --> 00:05:58,541
But listen, we should be focused
on these women and... not

123
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,162
- pointing fingers.
- I cannot imagine what it feels like.

124
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:04,012
It's hard enough to carry your own baby.
Imagine carrying somebody else's.

125
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:06,861
I suppose they could decide
to terminate, start over.

126
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:09,752
No, this is amelia's last embryo
with her dead husband's sperm.

127
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:11,602
This is it. There are no do-overs.

128
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:13,642
This is a nightmare...
lawsuits, our reputation.

129
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:15,993
I'm gonna call our lawyer, start

130
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:17,531
trying to do damage control.

131
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,422
- All right, I'll call Duncan.
- Duncan?

132
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:22,221
Yeah, medical malpractice
is his specialty, and...

133
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:24,690
- and he's someone we can trust.
- He's someone you can trust.

134
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:26,842
- I'll go ahead and call him.
- I said I'd call him.

135
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:29,270
As head of the practice,
I think the call should come from me.

136
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:31,991
I'll call him on the way
to the hospital.

137
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:37,781
This isn't my baby?

138
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:41,793
- How can this not be my baby?
- I know this is difficult to digest,

139
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:45,010
and I wish I didn't have
to tell you this.

140
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:47,012
Words cannot convey

141
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:48,793
how sorry I am, and...

142
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,620
there's no explanation I can offer you
that can excuse what's happened.

143
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:54,290
I can't believe this.

144
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:56,095
This isn't happening.

145
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:58,489
We've spent two years trying
to get pregnant, and now...

146
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,069
This isn't my baby?

147
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,880
You're telling me that this isn't...

148
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:05,021
This isn't my pregnancy?

149
00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:09,383
I saw the waddler
walking into her office.

150
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:11,501
I assume the grasshopper
was a false alarm.

151
00:07:11,628 --> 00:07:15,101
I should've called you. I got
caught up with some patients, and...

152
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:17,791
- we got some stuff going on here.
- You'll make it up to me.

153
00:07:18,156 --> 00:07:19,951
I need you to be my beard.

154
00:07:20,717 --> 00:07:22,603
William left again
without talking to me,

155
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:24,371
but I found out
where he's gonna be later.

156
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:26,543
I'll bump into him,
start a conversation,

157
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:28,150
- impress him.
- Stalk him.

158
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:30,862
What do I ever ask from you, Coop?

159
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:34,140
A little slap, a little tickle,
repeat as necessary.

160
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:36,162
I even let you
live with another woman.

161
00:07:36,635 --> 00:07:40,232
So you want to make an issue of this,
or you want to help me?

162
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:43,070
What time should I be there?

163
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:50,202
It's you, isn't it?
You're... carrying my baby.

164
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,171
Amelia, maybe let's give Zoe
some time...

165
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:55,013
I know this is so awful,
but at least it's you.

166
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:57,260
We can do it, right?
We can do this?

167
00:07:57,397 --> 00:08:00,293
I'll respect your wishes about
the baby, about everything.

168
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,353
And I'll trust you with mine.

169
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:05,602
Amelia, I c...

170
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:08,941
I can't. We have
other embryos stored.

171
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:12,403
- We're gonna start over.
- No, that's my baby. You can't...

172
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:15,211
I don't have any other eggs.

173
00:08:16,308 --> 00:08:18,842
- I'm carrying your baby.
- I don't want that. I...

174
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:20,451
We want you to fix this mistake.

175
00:08:20,586 --> 00:08:23,631
What? You want me to kill the baby?
I can't do that. You can't do that.

176
00:08:23,658 --> 00:08:25,442
Why don't we all just go back
into my office

177
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,440
- and discuss this?
- No, I just want to go home.

178
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,251
I want a lot of things.
Please...

179
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:32,102
I won't do this.
I will not end this pregnancy.

180
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:35,853
And if you do anything to that baby,
I'm gonna have this baby,

181
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:37,581
and I'm gonna keep it!

182
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,722
Hey. I saw Katie this morning.
I'm worried she's off her meds.

183
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,911
Katie? Oh, no.
She's been really compliant.

184
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,890
I mean, she's cheerful,
which is a concern, but...

185
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:46,522
Not cheerful. She's euphoric.

186
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:49,223
She's talking about her miscarriage
with excitement.

187
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:51,000
Well, we have a session
this afternoon.

188
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:53,630
I'll talk to her about it then.
Thanks.

189
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:10,210
She still hasn't given me an answer
to my proposal.

190
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:13,801
This is awkward, between us.

191
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,630
- I mean, I like you. I do, Pete.
- Are you gonna propose to me?

192
00:09:18,186 --> 00:09:20,831
You... you're funny.
I bet she likes that.

193
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:22,493
I guess...

194
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:25,820
Whichever way this turns out,
I'll know.

195
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:28,150
I'll know I tried.

196
00:09:32,878 --> 00:09:36,242
We have done nothing wrong.
Nothing biblical anyway.

197
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:38,801
- Well, there's coveting.
- Okay, coveting.

198
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:41,233
- But that's not the bad sin.
- There are no good sins.

199
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:42,523
Are you even religious?

200
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:44,100
- Then why are we talking about sins?
- You're the one who brought up

201
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:45,100
- the bible.
- I did not.

202
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:47,673
It doesn't matter who brought it up,
okay? Because...

203
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,791
We're both going to hell.

204
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:52,443
What?

205
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,803
I feel guilty.
I feel...

206
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,460
Awful.

207
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:07,412
Which is why I should tell her.

208
00:10:07,968 --> 00:10:09,312
You know, this...

209
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:12,702
- this will destroy her life.
- But at least it'll be honest,

210
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:13,682
and she

211
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,433
deserves the truth.

212
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:21,281
We could be together.

213
00:10:22,627 --> 00:10:23,971
Think about that.

214
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:26,542
We could be together.

215
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:40,393
I covet you.

216
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:43,001
I... covet you.

217
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:58,743
I'm not the kind of guy who fights.
I just... don't see the point to it.

218
00:10:58,877 --> 00:11:01,182
And the times I've tried it,
you hurt your knuckles, you don't

219
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:03,783
really feel better, it doesn't
solve anything. And I guess

220
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,781
I'm, at heart, just a pacifist,
'cause I think fighting is stupid,

221
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:10,711
I think war is wrong,
and taking up arms for some cause

222
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:12,670
just lacks nobility
in today's world. So...

223
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,593
I'm not the kinda guy who fights,
but I should've fought for you.

224
00:11:20,237 --> 00:11:22,233
I should've fought for you, Violet.

225
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:25,182
And I don't really know
how else to say it except...

226
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:28,172
I want

227
00:11:28,526 --> 00:11:29,473
your kid,

228
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:31,293
whether it's mine or not. And...

229
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:32,641
I want your body,

230
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:35,423
whether it's pregnant or not.
And I want your heart,

231
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:38,313
whether I have to fight for it or not.
And I should've fought for it,

232
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:39,533
but I was...

233
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:40,562
confused

234
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:43,212
and angry and... scared. So...

235
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,602
I am fighting

236
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:48,992
now...

237
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:51,431
because I love you.

238
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:54,643
And I think we can be something.

239
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:56,543
I think we can be a family.

240
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:04,750
I'm...

241
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:10,403
I'm fat and overdue
and tired and cranky

242
00:12:14,497 --> 00:12:15,990
No, Pete. I'm sorry.

243
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:17,811
This is not what I want.

244
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:33,683
Year ago, I was stalking a man who
wanted nothing to do with me, and now

245
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:35,802
I'm turning two good men down.

246
00:12:36,638 --> 00:12:38,833
Do I hate myself?
Is it me?

247
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:40,631
Is it?
Am I the problem?

248
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:43,790
Do you think you're the problem?

249
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:48,430
Oh, that's very therapeutic, making
the patient answer her own question.

250
00:12:48,556 --> 00:12:49,662
And now I'm avoid it.

251
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:51,811
Okay, do you think one of them...
Pete or Sheldon...

252
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,312
do you think that could work?
You have to answer that one.

253
00:12:56,077 --> 00:12:58,873
- I don't know, Cooper!
- Well... Dr. Turner.

254
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:02,571
Hi. No one was up front.
It's time for my appointment, right?

255
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:07,133
I think your focus needs
to be on damage control.

256
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:09,492
First, you want to mitigate pain
and suffering. So...

257
00:13:09,626 --> 00:13:11,873
approach each woman separately
about a settlement.

258
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:15,231
Offer to cover all medical expenses
and make a large, lump-sum payment

259
00:13:15,356 --> 00:13:19,400
in exchange for releasing all claims
and signing a confidentiality agreement.

260
00:13:19,538 --> 00:13:23,340
You need to show these women
that someone has paid for the mistake.

261
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:30,992
You need to fire Dell.

262
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:36,352
No... Dell... is like family, and... we
don't even know that this is his fault.

263
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:38,331
You want to defend him? Fine.

264
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:40,341
But I do not believe
that this was you.

265
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:41,691
Dell is family, but

266
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:45,122
if saving the practice
means cutting him loose, then...

267
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:50,333
Are you firing me?

268
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:55,603
No, but for now,
you're behind a desk,

269
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:58,463
- phones and mail only.
- But I have patients.

270
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:00,500
I'm... delivering Violet's baby.

271
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:01,882
Dell... it's...

272
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,663
It's just for now.

273
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:12,112
So I spoke with Dr. Wilder, and...

274
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:15,933
- we have some concerns.
- Is it a boy or a girl, your baby?

275
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:19,483
Katie, your... medication

276
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:23,153
is a very important part
of managing your delusional disorder.

277
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:24,892
It's important that you keep taking it.

278
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:26,473
Does she kick much?

279
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:30,171
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:33,233
You were voicing your concerns,
and I wasn't answering.

281
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:35,901
I am taking my meds.

282
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:38,650
I don't want things to go back
to the way they were, Dr. Turner.

283
00:14:38,786 --> 00:14:40,630
It was crazy.
I was crazy.

284
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,720
I'm taking my meds
and I'm feeling great.

285
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:45,730
Can I touch it?

286
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,761
I don't think
that's a good idea, Ka...

287
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:50,562
The baby's moving.

288
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:53,930
Oh, it's a smart baby.
You can just tell.

289
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:55,822
Is it a boy or a girl?

290
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:59,831
- So you agree, she's of her meds?
- Yeah, I think she's off her meds.

291
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:01,480
I think she's lying about it.

292
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:05,192
I don't have any proof.
I'd like to 51-50 her. I just... I...

293
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:07,511
I think she's on the edge.
I got a bad feeling about this.

294
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:08,713
You can't commit someone
on a feeling.

295
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:10,982
But it really creeped me out,
the way she was looking at me.

296
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:13,052
Pete's right. You can't
commit someone on a feeling.

297
00:15:13,186 --> 00:15:14,912
What if the delusions
are amping up again?

298
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,420
What if she's just happy?

299
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:19,892
- She's done grieving.
- I know happiness when I see it.

300
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:24,572
What?

301
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,102
You know happiness?

302
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,091
When it's offered to you?

303
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:34,802
We are talking about Katie.

304
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:36,572
She may just be happy.

305
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:38,901
She wasn't happy.

306
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:41,090
I know happy.

307
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,912
I wanted to apologize
for this morning.

308
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:55,042
Don't. No.

309
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:57,850
- You... didn't do anything.
- I thought.

310
00:15:57,975 --> 00:15:59,951
Well, I thought I saw something.

311
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:03,582
But now I realize
I was just jumping to conclusions.

312
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:04,622
And...

313
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,040
You reassured me,

314
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:08,392
and I trust you.

315
00:16:10,675 --> 00:16:12,842
I went by the birthing suite and...

316
00:16:14,945 --> 00:16:16,090
Can we talk a minute?

317
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,870
No, it's okay, Addison.

318
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:23,563
I insulted her this morning
after you left.

319
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,231
I was feeling insecure about you,

320
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:27,940
and I insulted her.

321
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:31,111
I just hope she'll still
deliver our baby.

322
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:39,563
You didn't do anything. Of course
I'm still going to deliver your baby.

323
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:42,331
Family is the most important thing,
and...

324
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,082
nothing should get
in the way of that.

325
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:52,921
William, I am...

326
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:56,212
I am so flattered by the offer,
but...

327
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,863
something happened today...

328
00:16:58,995 --> 00:16:59,943
a very...

329
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:02,350
serious medical error... and...

330
00:17:02,836 --> 00:17:04,632
my practice is under fire.

331
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:05,710
So I'm...

332
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:08,013
I'm no longer a good candidate.

333
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:10,372
The measure of a person
is not the mistakes they make.

334
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,093
It's how they respond to them.

335
00:17:12,218 --> 00:17:13,073
I want you.

336
00:17:13,388 --> 00:17:16,733
I guess I'm just gonna have
to sell you a little harder.

337
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:18,951
May I get you another drink
while you wait?

338
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:38,872
Noah was gonna leave his wife...

339
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:40,730
For me.

340
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:44,022
And I... stopped him.

341
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:49,253
And I hate... that I stopped him.
And I hate...

342
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,340
Myself for feeling that way.

343
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,930
Who would've thought that
you'd turn out to be the nice guy?

344
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,440
Not Violet.

345
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:25,450
Congratulations mama.

346
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:27,910
on popping out the baby,
you did pop out that baby, right?

347
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:30,023
'cause that's the only possible
reason I can fathom

348
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:32,283
for uncle Coop to have left me
sitting alone like a fool

349
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,162
- at a restaurant last night.
- I'm sorry.

350
00:18:34,288 --> 00:18:36,681
- My fault. I was a wreck.
- Clearly.

351
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:39,030
You and I need to talk.

352
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:43,073
I can't talk about this.
I have a patient in crisis right now.

353
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:45,373
I can't have this conversation.
I'm sorry.

354
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:50,003
What's going on?
Is there a problem?

355
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:53,842
The problem, Sam, is that your ex-wife
is trying to steal my job.

356
00:18:57,497 --> 00:18:59,741
Amelia can't do it, not yet.
So...

357
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:02,730
I'm gonna have her
talk to Violet instead.

358
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:05,333
Nai, trust me. It would be much
better if you would just...

359
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,733
- Naomi, we we over this.
- I am not gonna force her to talk

360
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,192
to an attorney
if she's not ready to do it.

361
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:13,050
Well, I think you should bring
in another attorney.

362
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:15,382
I'm... not trying to put you
in the middle, Duncan.

363
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:17,011
I'll call you later.

364
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:25,341
I hate this.

365
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:29,411
I hate being on opposite sides.

366
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:31,640
Yeah, well, you may hate it,
but your side always wins.

367
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,873
This isn't about winning, Naomi.

368
00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:40,041
I've been offered
Charlotte King's job...

369
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,490
- At Pacific Wellcare Center.
- What?

370
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:46,031
That's crazy.

371
00:19:46,157 --> 00:19:48,520
- I mean, you know that, right?
- I thought so at first...

372
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,690
I thought so at first, too. I did.
But, Addison...

373
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:54,121
I'm floundering.

374
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:56,921
This whole year, just...

375
00:19:57,686 --> 00:20:00,091
Losing the practice and... Sam...

376
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:02,471
Renting out the fourth floor...

377
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:03,952
I mean, I'm trying

378
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,672
to move forward. I am.

379
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:06,850
But I...

380
00:20:06,985 --> 00:20:07,981
I haven't,

381
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:09,300
not really.

382
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:11,963
And this

383
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:12,982
offer...

384
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:16,302
- It's exciting.
- Nai, you are my best friend.

385
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:20,881
And with everything going on,
Addison...

386
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:23,302
Me leaving
would show that you did something.

387
00:20:23,437 --> 00:20:24,433
This is...

388
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:26,222
your practice.

389
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:28,313
Not anymore.

390
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,363
Where's Betsey?

391
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:44,971
- Tell me she's okay.
- Yeah, she's fine. She's...

392
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:47,542
She's at a motel with a friend.

393
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:53,052
That's it? You took my daughter
in the middle of the night.

394
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:55,373
You... took her, and...
and I had no idea where you were,

395
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:57,150
if she was okay, and you just...

396
00:20:58,035 --> 00:21:01,283
- You're high, aren't you?
- St. Louis was really bad.

397
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:04,933
- I need money.
- You think I'm...

398
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:06,881
You think I'm gonna give you
money for drugs?

399
00:21:07,006 --> 00:21:10,473
I don't need a lecture, okay?
I need $10,000.

400
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:13,350
You're insane.

401
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,843
Even if I had that kind of money,
after everything you've done,

402
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,473
you think I'd give it to you?

403
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:19,451
If you give me the money...

404
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:24,011
I'll give you Betsey.

405
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,001
Maybe I'm not meant to be a mother.

406
00:21:28,127 --> 00:21:30,242
- Maybe I'm not meant to be happy.
- I don't...

407
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:33,252
I don't believe that's true.
I think everybody's meant to be happy.

408
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:35,320
It's easy for you to say.
You're about to

409
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:37,182
- have a baby.
- This isn't what you want.

410
00:21:37,305 --> 00:21:38,941
I know that, Amelia.
But you could

411
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:41,090
carry this child and give it up,

412
00:21:41,215 --> 00:21:43,023
and then become a mother
another way.

413
00:21:43,158 --> 00:21:44,140
NaomI's right.

414
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:45,433
There are other ways.

415
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,020
My happiness?

416
00:21:47,368 --> 00:21:48,832
It's right here.

417
00:21:49,146 --> 00:21:50,941
It's right in front of me.

418
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:53,513
I can't fathom letting it go.

419
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:09,042
I don't know.
Maybe you and Sheldon are right.

420
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:10,572
Maybe I don't know how to be happy.

421
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,642
For a long time, I've been at

422
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:15,940
baseline... just alive,
breathing, heart beating.

423
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,942
Happy just seemed really far away.

424
00:22:19,216 --> 00:22:20,750
And that was the best I could do.

425
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:21,682
But...

426
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:25,770
I'm...

427
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,571
I'm having a baby, Pete.

428
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:30,440
I am making a person,

429
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:33,541
which is a really optimistic thing
to do. I mean, that is

430
00:22:33,678 --> 00:22:34,702
really happy,

431
00:22:34,838 --> 00:22:36,680
which scares me a lot.
But...

432
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,292
the point is, the...
the point...

433
00:22:38,427 --> 00:22:40,723
maybe I don't know how to be happy,

434
00:22:41,368 --> 00:22:43,922
but I want to learn.
I want to be happy, Pete.

435
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:45,041
And you...

436
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:46,761
You...
so often...

437
00:22:47,376 --> 00:22:48,570
make me happy.

438
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:50,031
So...

439
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:53,041
so I know that I said no, but if
you were still willing to fight for me,

440
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:54,793
then I am willing to be fought for.

441
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:57,341
Except it really wouldn't be much
of a fight, because you'd win...

442
00:22:57,465 --> 00:22:58,413
Be quiet.

443
00:23:10,337 --> 00:23:12,122
I have to give Sheldon an answer.

444
00:23:12,248 --> 00:23:14,400
I don't want to have
any secrets anymore.

445
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:16,491
And then I think
I'm just gonna go home and sleep,

446
00:23:16,615 --> 00:23:19,650
- 'cause I have not been sleeping at...
- What did I say about being quiet?

447
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:26,852
I forgot to tell you
that I love you.

448
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:36,122
I think it was my fault...
Zoe and Amelia.

449
00:23:36,926 --> 00:23:38,921
I checked the calendar, and...

450
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:41,090
my lawyer called that day
to tell me that

451
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:43,080
he couldn't find Heather and Betsey.

452
00:23:44,185 --> 00:23:46,132
And it was killing me, and...

453
00:23:46,506 --> 00:23:47,303
What?

454
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:52,181
Heather's back.
She showed up strung out.

455
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,101
She'll... give me my daughter

456
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:55,440
if I give her

457
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:56,572
$10,000.

458
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:58,662
You can't buy your daughter.

459
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,410
I can't let her run with my child.

460
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:03,331
So then you come running to Naomi

461
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:05,171
after you blamed her
for your mistake?

462
00:24:05,296 --> 00:24:08,103
- Sam, he apologized.
- Of course he apologized.

463
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:09,720
He wants your money.

464
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,012
It's not your problem.

465
00:24:12,205 --> 00:24:14,601
I'm sorry I asked.
I'm sorry I asked.

466
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,152
- What is wrong with you?
- No, what is wrong with you?

467
00:24:19,275 --> 00:24:20,642
You do not buy children,

468
00:24:20,778 --> 00:24:22,561
you don't help drug addicts
kill themselves,

469
00:24:22,686 --> 00:24:25,522
and you do not take the fall for Dell
and then flee to...

470
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,101
to work for the enemy!

471
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:30,702
How could you not tell me?

472
00:24:30,827 --> 00:24:32,842
We were supposed to be
partners here.

473
00:24:33,018 --> 00:24:36,743
- You're the one who wanted distance.
- I said we couldn't be best friends.

474
00:24:37,387 --> 00:24:39,882
- I didn't tell you to leave.
- You were right.

475
00:24:40,016 --> 00:24:43,073
I mean, look... look at how you reacted
to Duncan yesterday, Sam.

476
00:24:43,196 --> 00:24:44,372
That's... not business.

477
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:46,463
That's you not liking the fact
that I'm dating Duncan.

478
00:24:46,497 --> 00:24:49,081
- I don't like you dating him!
- You know what? But you don't get a say.

479
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:52,130
Why do you get a say? We...
we're... not married, Sam.

480
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:55,913
- Why should it matter?
- Because I'm still in love with you!

481
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:02,212
Why? What?
What do you... what...

482
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:04,882
what, is... that supposed
to make me want to stay

483
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:07,653
or is that supposed
to make me want to go?

484
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:50,633
- You okay?
- I will be.

485
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:53,933
How did you get my address?

486
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:56,550
I'm sorry to bother you at home.
I know it crosses a boundary.

487
00:25:56,676 --> 00:25:57,773
It's just...

488
00:25:59,286 --> 00:26:01,131
I don't want to lie to you.

489
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:03,003
You've helped me so much.

490
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:07,050
I needed to talk to you.
I needed to let you know, that I know.

491
00:26:08,298 --> 00:26:09,520
What? What is it?

492
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,082
You have my baby.

493
00:26:13,265 --> 00:26:14,712
And I want it back.

494
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:26,662
Yes, Dr. Turner?

495
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:28,983
What was in the syringe?

496
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:30,842
It doesn't matter what was
in the syringe.

497
00:26:30,975 --> 00:26:33,183
What matters is, you can't move
from the neck down.

498
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:35,273
Did you know you can order

499
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:37,693
drugs from other countries

500
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:40,090
and have them delivered right
to your door?

501
00:26:40,228 --> 00:26:41,922
The internet is amazing.

502
00:26:42,156 --> 00:26:43,950
Katie, we need to talk about this.

503
00:26:44,076 --> 00:26:45,803
You've done a very dangerous thing,

504
00:26:45,935 --> 00:26:48,970
- so we should discuss your options.
- I'm not listening to you anymore.

505
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,771
I'm getting my baby out of your body

506
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:53,021
and bringing him home
where he belongs.

507
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:54,140
I don't...

508
00:26:54,476 --> 00:26:55,781
what are you gonna do,

509
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:57,190
cut him out of my body?

510
00:26:58,228 --> 00:27:00,853
Oh, you're scared. I can tell.
But don't worry.

511
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:04,830
I read all about it on the internet.
The internet... it's amazing.

512
00:27:05,328 --> 00:27:07,673
You can even order surgical supplies.

513
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:15,992
Thank you for coming.

514
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:18,750
Martin didn't want me to, but...

515
00:27:19,318 --> 00:27:21,270
he doesn't know you.
I do.

516
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:22,653
And...

517
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,971
I wanted you to know
that I'm not a monster.

518
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:27,643
I just...

519
00:27:28,776 --> 00:27:31,071
This is my life, and I have dreams,

520
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,662
and I have one chance
to make them happen, and

521
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:36,250
I can't.

522
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:40,482
I can't turn what I've always wanted
into a nightmare.

523
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:44,112
For me, that baby inside you,
I thought was my last chance.

524
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,090
Only...

525
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,211
maybe it's not.

526
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,583
I want that baby.

527
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:52,843
But...

528
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:55,751
I can't make you carry him, so...

529
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:57,181
Maybe...

530
00:27:57,366 --> 00:28:00,580
maybe the reason
this all happened is...

531
00:28:00,775 --> 00:28:02,052
is that this...

532
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:04,473
is my new chance.

533
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:08,933
You want to carry your own child.
I understand.

534
00:28:09,915 --> 00:28:11,211
But this baby...

535
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:15,181
I can't get rid of it.

536
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:17,111
I love him.

537
00:28:18,016 --> 00:28:19,811
We all have dreams, and...

538
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:22,183
sometimes they get complicated.

539
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:24,410
And so sometimes we have to stop

540
00:28:24,675 --> 00:28:25,491
and...

541
00:28:25,668 --> 00:28:29,462
let go of one dream so that
we can move forward with another one.

542
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,531
I can't.

543
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:44,240
I can't let you keep my child.

544
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:45,521
I'm sorry.

545
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:52,312
I know you're meeting
with other doctors.

546
00:28:52,977 --> 00:28:55,800
And while Naomi Bennett
is an amazing fertility specialist,

547
00:28:55,937 --> 00:28:57,632
her track record
at running a practice...

548
00:28:57,766 --> 00:29:00,023
- This is not about Dr. Bennett.
- You're right.

549
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:02,530
It's about whether or not
I can give you want you want.

550
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:06,240
If you want to make this the next
Mayo, Cleveland, Palo Altclinic,

551
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,070
- I can do that.
- Really?

552
00:29:08,675 --> 00:29:10,801
These are letters of intent
from Wilson Stafford,

553
00:29:10,938 --> 00:29:13,142
Sanjay Finamore and Joy Hopkins,

554
00:29:13,277 --> 00:29:14,781
each one, the best in their field.

555
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:19,261
All it takes is your signature, and
I can have them working for us tomorrow.

556
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:22,281
Well, I'll give this some thought.

557
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:27,461
Impressive speech.

558
00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:31,341
- Don't try and get in my good graces.
- I'm sorry about

559
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:32,971
last night, and I know...

560
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:35,830
I haven't been giving you enough.
But listen to this...

561
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:38,051
things are gonna change.
Violet

562
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:41,212
- is moving in with Pete.
- Every time you had a choice,

563
00:29:41,338 --> 00:29:43,912
you chose her.
Now she doesn't need you anymore.

564
00:29:44,037 --> 00:29:45,113
Well, you know what?

565
00:29:45,236 --> 00:29:46,321
Neither do I.

566
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:53,262
I'm sorry.

567
00:29:53,715 --> 00:29:55,012
I couldn't. I...

568
00:29:55,965 --> 00:29:56,913
I just...

569
00:29:59,445 --> 00:30:01,042
She loves you.
I couldn't...

570
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,663
- I understand.
- I can't

571
00:30:02,788 --> 00:30:05,883
be this person, you know,
a person who does this...

572
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:08,172
- Horrible thing to another woman.
- I know.

573
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,303
- I know.
- I'm sorry. I'm...

574
00:30:11,098 --> 00:30:12,091
I'm sorry.

575
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:22,702
We can't.

576
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:23,783
We can't.

577
00:30:27,315 --> 00:30:28,361
I love you.

578
00:30:29,606 --> 00:30:31,403
If you want me to walk away,
I'll walk away.

579
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:33,270
If you want me to stay...

580
00:31:03,348 --> 00:31:04,440
It's Morgan.

581
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:08,750
She's in labor.

582
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:19,022
I know you can remember
what happened to your baby.

583
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:19,940
Try...

584
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:21,713
try and think.

585
00:31:22,488 --> 00:31:23,541
My baby died.

586
00:31:24,436 --> 00:31:27,091
That's what you want me to say,
right? That's the correct answer?

587
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:29,652
What do you think
the correct answer is?

588
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:32,373
My baby didn't die.
Yours died,

589
00:31:32,878 --> 00:31:35,053
so you took mine.
You stole my baby.

590
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:39,143
But your baby was a girl.

591
00:31:40,878 --> 00:31:42,072
Mine is a boy.

592
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,042
There's a boy in here.

593
00:31:46,576 --> 00:31:48,523
I know it sounds crazy. I do.

594
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:51,200
But I'm not crazy.
I'm a normal person.

595
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,241
I believe it's true.
This is my baby.

596
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:56,450
And if I don't follow my instincts
and I let you take my baby...

597
00:31:56,585 --> 00:31:58,483
Katie, lookt me. Look at me.

598
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:01,413
I believe you...

599
00:32:03,076 --> 00:32:05,222
That you think this is your baby.

600
00:32:05,935 --> 00:32:08,081
But I think this is my baby, too.

601
00:32:09,157 --> 00:32:12,751
It has grown in me for months,
and I... and I love this baby.

602
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:15,451
And I know you love this baby, too.

603
00:32:15,926 --> 00:32:17,221
So if you cut...

604
00:32:18,298 --> 00:32:19,142
Then...

605
00:32:19,697 --> 00:32:21,390
the baby might get hurt.

606
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:25,810
And we both love this baby
too much to hurt it, right?

607
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:33,131
So let's not do this,

608
00:32:33,757 --> 00:32:34,952
not right now.

609
00:32:35,716 --> 00:32:36,713
It kicked.

610
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:39,330
It's calling me.

611
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:42,342
My baby's calling me.

612
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:47,840
If you would just wait, maybe...

613
00:32:48,486 --> 00:32:50,880
I told you, I'm not crazy.
I know I can't wait.

614
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:52,980
I've attacked you in your home.
I've drugged you.

615
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:54,982
You think they'll give me my baby
after that?

616
00:32:55,115 --> 00:32:55,930
Shut up!

617
00:32:57,697 --> 00:33:00,240
- I'm sorry.
- Katie, please...

618
00:33:00,886 --> 00:33:03,042
Oh, God. It'll be better
once the baby's out.

619
00:33:03,178 --> 00:33:04,651
Once the baby's out, I'll be gone,

620
00:33:04,778 --> 00:33:07,052
and you won't have to worry
about me anymore.

621
00:33:07,176 --> 00:33:09,521
- I'll work fast.
- Katie, please...

622
00:33:11,966 --> 00:33:12,810
Please.

623
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:17,352
<i>Your family, whatever that means...
if you're single, if you're married,</i>

624
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:20,402
<i>if you have kids,
or if you want kids...</i>

625
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:22,931
<i>Your family should be
the most important thing.</i>

626
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,441
<i>And your family is the most...</i>

627
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:25,670
Dr. Bennett.

628
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:30,383
I've been walking around
thinking about Amelia

629
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:32,152
and about the baby, and

630
00:33:32,555 --> 00:33:34,111
I can't let her keep my child.

631
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:35,992
Just the thought of it...

632
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,102
But...

633
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:40,670
maybe you're right
about moving forward.

634
00:33:40,807 --> 00:33:43,091
And so I'm thinking maybe I can

635
00:33:43,596 --> 00:33:45,141
carry Amelia's baby

636
00:33:45,488 --> 00:33:47,131
and she can carry mine.

637
00:34:00,495 --> 00:34:01,932
I'm upset with you, Dell,

638
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:03,250
for what you did

639
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:05,233
and for the position
that you put the practice in,

640
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:06,570
- for how you've been acting...
- Sam, just...

641
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:07,821
let me finish.

642
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:12,292
But I know that you've been hurting.

643
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:17,070
And I knowthat when you've lost
somebody that you love...

644
00:34:19,906 --> 00:34:22,251
I know that you need to do
whatever it takes

645
00:34:22,388 --> 00:34:23,730
to get them back.

646
00:34:26,937 --> 00:34:27,910
$10,000.

647
00:34:30,015 --> 00:34:31,192
Get your daughter back.

648
00:34:32,798 --> 00:34:35,243
Our baby's coming.
He's really coming.

649
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:36,742
How are you feeling?

650
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,273
Good. Everything's good,
right, Dr. Montgomery?

651
00:34:39,405 --> 00:34:43,150
Everything looks fine, yeah.
Let's just see how dilated you are.

652
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,413
This list...

653
00:34:48,975 --> 00:34:50,021
Impressive.

654
00:34:50,147 --> 00:34:51,091
Almost...

655
00:34:51,448 --> 00:34:52,343
perfect.

656
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:55,613
But if you brought
all these doctors here,

657
00:34:55,646 --> 00:34:57,213
how long do you suppose they'd last?

658
00:34:57,308 --> 00:34:58,671
Your stuff doesn't like you.

659
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:00,602
You use 'em like pawns.

660
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:03,013
The best work is done by people
who are inspired,

661
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:04,911
who push themselves because they...

662
00:35:04,927 --> 00:35:06,682
they want to be a part
of something larger.

663
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:08,290
And you think that Naomi Bennett,

664
00:35:08,417 --> 00:35:09,661
or anyone else,

665
00:35:10,148 --> 00:35:11,773
is gonna be able to do that for you?

666
00:35:11,896 --> 00:35:14,242
The plans I have for this practice...

667
00:35:15,438 --> 00:35:17,821
require someone with a heart,
Charlotte.

668
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:34,720
Where's the money, Dell?

669
00:35:35,027 --> 00:35:37,020
You said you'd give me the money.

670
00:35:37,157 --> 00:35:38,502
I need the money.

671
00:35:39,757 --> 00:35:41,803
You're not gonna see her again.

672
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:47,481
Look, I have the money, but
I'm not gonna give it to you, okay?

673
00:35:47,505 --> 00:35:49,830
- And she's not going anywhere.
- You don't have custody.

674
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:51,532
- I do.
- You're strung out.

675
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:53,523
So I can pick up the phone
and I can call D.C.F.S.

676
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:54,832
or I can pick up the phone
and I can call the police,

677
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:56,911
and we can have them
come down here. You tell me.

678
00:35:57,325 --> 00:35:59,620
Look, I am not giving you this money
to let you kill yourself,

679
00:35:59,685 --> 00:36:01,173
because I may hate you right now,

680
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:05,171
but I love her, and you're her mother,
and I am not letting go of my daughter.

681
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:09,331
So come say good-bye to your daughter.
Come say good-bye to Betsey.

682
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,862
Come say good-bye.

683
00:36:15,906 --> 00:36:16,751
Baby...

684
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:25,340
You're gonna have to stay with daddy
for a little while, okay?

685
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:28,130
I love you.

686
00:36:32,365 --> 00:36:34,611
- I'm gonna get her back.
- Mommy!

687
00:36:35,247 --> 00:36:36,580
Come here....

688
00:36:37,748 --> 00:36:38,842
It's okay...

689
00:36:41,447 --> 00:36:42,941
Violet isn't answering the phone.

690
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,672
She came down.
I was with a patient.

691
00:36:44,845 --> 00:36:47,201
But she left me a note. She said
it was important, you know, and

692
00:36:47,326 --> 00:36:48,593
I got the sense that's...

693
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,042
Have you heard anything from her?

694
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:55,553
- No, not in the last few hours.
- It sounded like she had an answer...

695
00:36:55,828 --> 00:36:56,622
To my

696
00:36:56,936 --> 00:36:57,883
proposal.

697
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:00,420
I'm sure she'll call you back.

698
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:06,092
You know.

699
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:08,983
You know the answer.

700
00:37:11,545 --> 00:37:13,341
You should talk to Violet.

701
00:37:19,515 --> 00:37:21,213
Take good care of her...

702
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:23,342
of them.

703
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:32,621
Maybe I shouldn't have said what I said
about how I feel.

704
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:37,700
That's my issue. It's not yours, and...
and I can deal with it. But this...

705
00:37:38,276 --> 00:37:39,820
This is our practice.

706
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:41,180
We built it.

707
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,353
I can be okay with...
with you moving on,

708
00:37:45,526 --> 00:37:46,521
but not...

709
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,061
not with you leaving.

710
00:37:52,866 --> 00:37:55,811
- You are the heart of this place.
- I took the job.

711
00:38:02,387 --> 00:38:03,733
That's a cop-out.

712
00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:06,583
I do not accept it.

713
00:38:08,117 --> 00:38:09,763
It's what I have to do.

714
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:25,061
- That was a strong one.
- You're doing great.

715
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:29,771
- You okay?
- Please don't. Just don't.

716
00:38:30,096 --> 00:38:31,971
Okay, I should've asked for drugs.

717
00:38:32,105 --> 00:38:33,851
Is it too late for drugs?

718
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,212
I'm sorry... Morgan.
It is.

719
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:38,290
Here comes another one, Noah!

720
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:40,921
You're doing great.
You're doing fine.

721
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:44,060
I can't believe
we're finally getting to...

722
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,901
After the babies that died,

723
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:48,181
we're actually gonna be a family.

724
00:38:57,567 --> 00:39:01,810
Morgan Gellman's in the birthing suite.
I need you to go deliver her baby.

725
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:05,100
- What... about no patient con...
- Just deliver the baby.

726
00:39:07,736 --> 00:39:09,133
I can't. And...

727
00:39:09,535 --> 00:39:13,263
I'll be here if you need anything,
but I need you to go do this.

728
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:18,403
Betsey, I've got some work to do, okay?
But Addison's right here.

729
00:39:36,966 --> 00:39:38,511
- Hello.
- I need you Cooper.

730
00:39:38,646 --> 00:39:42,790
- Yeah, I just got to Violet's, so...
- Cooper, I need you. I got fired.

731
00:39:43,326 --> 00:39:45,570
Okay, I'll...
I'll be right there.

732
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,143
He's gone.

733
00:40:02,278 --> 00:40:03,872
I'm gonna get started.

734
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:07,753
"Transverse incision..."

735
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:14,210
What?

736
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:17,542
Don't cut there. It's too high.

737
00:40:18,595 --> 00:40:21,990
You know no matter where I cut,
you won't survive, right?

738
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:23,493
I know.

739
00:40:25,097 --> 00:40:26,293
It's for the baby.

740
00:40:26,947 --> 00:40:28,960
If you cut there,
you'll cut the baby.

741
00:40:29,748 --> 00:40:31,292
I know. I'm a doctor.

742
00:40:31,915 --> 00:40:33,562
I'm your doctor, Katie.

743
00:40:36,415 --> 00:40:37,510
Tell me what to do.

744
00:40:39,116 --> 00:40:41,680
Measure two fingers
above my pelvic bone.

745
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:46,410
Now what?

746
00:40:47,715 --> 00:40:48,612
After...

747
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,211
after you get the baby out,

748
00:40:55,047 --> 00:40:56,990
you cut that cord right away.

749
00:40:57,417 --> 00:41:00,011
You cut it right away.
You keep him warm,

750
00:41:00,365 --> 00:41:03,412
and you make sure to clear
his mouth and his nose.

751
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:07,560
- You promise me you'll do that?
- I promise.

752
00:41:07,796 --> 00:41:08,691
Tell me.

753
00:41:11,517 --> 00:41:14,112
Make a clean slice
on the horizontal.

754
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,931
You're gonna have to cut through
the muscle to get to the baby.

755
00:41:20,935 --> 00:41:22,482
I just want to say...

756
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:27,600
I think under different circumstances,
we could've been friends.

757
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,030
Don't you think?

758
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,061
Friends.

759
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:43,240
