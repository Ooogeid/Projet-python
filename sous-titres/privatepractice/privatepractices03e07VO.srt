1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,352
{\pos(192,230)}You know what gets on my nerves?

2
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:06,974
{\pos(192,230)}This assertion
that we are supposed to

3
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:10,142
{\pos(250,268)}pair up, you know,
that we have to be in couples.

4
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:12,007
{\pos(250,268)}And love, marriage, you know.

5
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:14,964
Marriage was invented
as a financial transaction,

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,623
and it does not make you whole.

7
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:18,717
And a lot of marriages
end in divorce.

8
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:21,020
Most marriages end in divorce.

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,615
I'm divorced.
You're divorced.

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,245
Marriage is stupid.

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,670
My life is mine.

12
00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:28,358
- Right?
- t's a good life.

13
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:29,483
Right.

14
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:31,891
Last night I stayed home
with my cat.

15
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:35,916
We ordered sushi and learned about
the Kombai tribes of New Guinea.

16
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:37,384
Good times.

17
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,724
I need sex,

18
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:41,833
like I need water. I'm in a desert.

19
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,851
And it's not actually
the sex that I miss,

20
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:46,512
which I would be very grateful for,
let's be clear about that.

21
00:00:46,637 --> 00:00:49,955
It's just that feeling,
you know, of being alive.

22
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,344
I mean, the flutter that you get
in your stomach when

23
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,112
you first kiss someone

24
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,946
and your lips part your tongues...

25
00:00:58,071 --> 00:00:59,371
Stop. Just stop.

26
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:03,011
I gotta sit.

27
00:01:07,845 --> 00:01:10,014
I need it, too,
but if you tell anybody...

28
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:11,139
I won't.

29
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:20,788
What if you had said yes?

30
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:24,668
- Yes to what?
- In med school when I asked you out

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,317
Right. What if you had said yes?

32
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:31,724
I couldn't. I mean, Nai was
my best friend,

33
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:34,570
- and she had a huge crush on you.
- I know, and so I asked her out

34
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,844
and then we got married,
and then we got divorced.

35
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:39,738
Derek asked you out. You got
married and you got divorced.

36
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:41,463
So I'm asking you now.

37
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:44,282
What if you had said yes?

38
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,707
Do you think that
we would've had a shot

39
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:50,443
at making it?

40
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:54,555
- Me and you?
- Me and you.

41
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,490
Help me!

42
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,576
Help me!

43
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,810
Over here.

44
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:05,478
- What happened?
- My wife...

45
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,586
All right, pulse and respiratory rate
are rapid.

46
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:12,351
I have no signal this deep
in the canyon.

47
00:02:12,476 --> 00:02:14,884
Use mine. All right,
tender on the right side.

48
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,053
- He's losing a lot of blood.
- My wife...

49
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,680
We're gonna call her
just as soon as we can, sir.

50
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:21,098
Our car crashed.

51
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:24,018
I tried to get help.

52
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,495
She's over there.

53
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:29,448
Help my wife.

54
00:02:56,405 --> 00:02:57,712
Thank God you came.

55
00:02:57,837 --> 00:02:59,720
My name's Addison.
I'm a doctor.

56
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:02,348
- Where does it hurt?
- Everywhere.

57
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,516
And we're stuck. Can you...
Could you get us out?

58
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:08,644
Where's Jake?
Did they get him to the hospital?

59
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,644
Jake's with my friend Sam.
He's a doctor.

60
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,707
Let's try to get you
out of this car, okay?

61
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:13,901
I can't. My...

62
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,069
arm is...

63
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:16,320
stuck.

64
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:23,995
- Can you feel your fingers?
- I could yes-yesterday.

65
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:27,437
Now they're tingly.
I'm worried about the baby.

66
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:29,762
You've been here since yesterday?

67
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:33,790
It was getting dark when we crashed,
and Jake left before sunset.

68
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:36,415
When he didn't come back,
I was afraid.

69
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,290
Thank God he made it out.

70
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:41,470
We found him about
50 feet up on the hill.

71
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,557
He was out there... all night?

72
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:48,285
But I thought you were here
to get me out.

73
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,354
It's just you and... your friend?

74
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:52,731
You can't get me out.

75
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,175
Listen to me. Jake is alive.
Sam is helping him.

76
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,028
But I need to check the baby.

77
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,557
Now when's your due date?

78
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,319
Today.

79
00:04:06,535 --> 00:04:07,735
I'm due today.

80
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,043
<i>Saison 03 Épisode 06
The Hard Part</i>

81
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,580
{\pub}{\pos(192,210)}We close early on saturdays.

82
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:25,917
{\pos(192,230)}Brendon got married today, dude.

83
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:28,142
- Mazel tov, Brendon.
- Mazel tov!

84
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,060
{\pos(192,230)}You know, you can't drink
in here, you guys.

85
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:32,968
{\pos(192,230)}Your wedding day's a big day.

86
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:35,257
{\pos(192,230)}You might not want to be
so drunk that you forget it.

87
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:36,942
{\pos(192,230)}I'm not drunk.
I have a problem.

88
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:39,731
{\pos(192,230)}It's my wedding night,
and Melissa and I,

89
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:42,464
{\pos(192,230)}tonight will be the first time.

90
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:44,238
Okay. You're virgins?

91
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:47,691
{\pos(120,230)}We figured it was important
to make the first time, you know,

92
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:49,666
{\pos(192,230)}- special.
- That's sweet.

93
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:53,095
{\pos(120,230)}I'm sorry. Did you need something?

94
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,941
{\pos(120,230)}I didn't want to take a chance, so

95
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:57,692
{\pos(250,268)}I took these pills
right after we said "I do".

96
00:04:57,817 --> 00:05:01,217
{\pos(192,210)}I was hoping they would
kick in by tonight, and they did.

97
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:04,366
{\pos(192,230)}But it's been up for, like,

98
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,513
3 hours.

99
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:08,807
And my mother-in-law
tried to hug me...

100
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:13,075
{\pos(192,230)}- How many did you take?
- Four,

101
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:15,071
maybe five.

102
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,750
This is the sexology place, right?

103
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,429
{\pos(192,230)}She's dehydrated. I'm afraid
of vascular collapse.

104
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,767
{\pos(192,230)}- The baby's okay?
- She says she can feel movement,

105
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:25,010
{\pos(120,230)}but I can't angle in
to hear the fetal heartbeat.

106
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:28,031
{\pos(120,230)}There could be a placental abruption.
I don't know. How's he doing?

107
00:05:28,156 --> 00:05:30,547
{\pos(192,210)}Broken rib, he's got
a deep gash to his thigh,

108
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:32,920
bleeding internally, he's bad.
I gotta get help fast.

109
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:35,032
{\pos(192,210)}You think you can get outta here
before dark?

110
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:37,753
{\pos(192,210)}If I run, maybe.
It took us 3 hours to get in.

111
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:40,631
{\pos(192,210)}All right, I'll just go
back and forth between 'em,

112
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,301
{\pos(192,210)}try to keep them both stable
until you come back with help.

113
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,448
{\pos(192,210)}All right, I'll put
a pressure dressing on him

114
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:48,005
{\pos(192,210)}so he doesn't bleed out,
then I'll go.

115
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,139
{\pos(250,268)}Go fast, Sam.

116
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:58,363
{\pos(120,268)}Which one of you has the erection?

117
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,390
Priapism's no joke, fellas.
If I don't get that mast down,

118
00:06:01,515 --> 00:06:05,406
- this boat might never sail again.
- You wanna walk my plank, captain?

119
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:08,407
{\pos(120,268)}What's your name?

120
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,330
{\pos(120,268)}Let me tell you the procedure
for reversing priapism.

121
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,925
{\pos(192,210)}First I take a long-gauge needle, and
I push it down the head of the penis,

122
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,004
then I slowly draw out blood,
flush it with saline and repeat.

123
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:21,699
{\pos(120,268)}Still the man, Dan?

124
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:23,661
{\pos(120,268)}Now who has the erection?

125
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:27,118
{\pos(192,210)}Nice to meet you.
Follow me.

126
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,599
- Oh, God.
- Sorry, man.

127
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,317
It's okay, it's okay.

128
00:06:34,442 --> 00:06:36,655
As long as you're taking care
of Kara, it's okay.

129
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,087
{\pos(192,210)}You both survived
a really horrible crash.

130
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:41,747
{\pos(192,210)}- The baby seems okay.
- I thought I could make it out.

131
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:43,471
{\pos(192,210)}I thought I could do it, you know?

132
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:46,650
{\pos(192,210)}All right. Addison will be back
to check up on you.

133
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,808
What's wrong?

134
00:06:50,138 --> 00:06:51,438
I can't breathe.

135
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,147
Damn it. You've got
a collapsed lung.

136
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:02,745
All right, I'm gonna have to
make an incision in your chest

137
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,020
to relieve some of this pressure.

138
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:07,195
This is gonna hurt. Here we go.

139
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:21,747
Stay with me, Jake...

140
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:29,277
{\pub}- You need to drop 'em.
- I can't.

141
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:31,077
We're dealing with
a ticking clock here.

142
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,967
The longer you wait,
the greater the chance

143
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:35,120
of permanent vascular
and neurological damage.

144
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:38,787
Do you want your Johnson
to fall off?

145
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,777
He's a virgin,
and it's his wedding night.

146
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:43,633
What's that have to do
with anything?

147
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:45,566
{\pos(120,268)}I think standing
in front of Maria Sharapova

148
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:48,091
{\pos(120,268)}with a pitched tent is a little
like cheating on his bride.

149
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:50,625
{\pos(120,268)}That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard. I'm a physician,

150
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,161
{\pos(120,268)}- and we have a tennis court reserved.
- What if I came in,

151
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:55,158
{\pos(120,268)}if I was there,
sort of like a chaperone?

152
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:56,456
For his penis?

153
00:07:57,613 --> 00:07:59,563
Fine. Just get his pants off.

154
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,064
I think you might want to...
change your clothes.

155
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:07,661
Does that hurt?

156
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:12,157
This is my fault...

157
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:13,952
The crash.

158
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,482
A bee flew in the car,
and I grabbed Jake's arm.

159
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:20,207
- I didn't mean to.
- It was an accident.

160
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:22,879
- That hurts.
- That's your rib.

161
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:24,191
It's probably broken.

162
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:26,560
That ought to make delivery
really fun.

163
00:08:26,814 --> 00:08:29,133
My vote is for a C-section

164
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:31,351
in a hospital.

165
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:32,886
I second that vote.

166
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,857
Jake wanted a home birth.
I told him that's fine

167
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:39,232
as long as the baby come outta him.

168
00:08:42,262 --> 00:08:45,078
- What happened?
- Almost. Collapsed lung.

169
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,090
Easy.
There we go, there we go.

170
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:50,863
I had to improvise a chest tube.
He's stable, but

171
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:53,954
we have to keep opening the tube
every half an hour...

172
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:56,818
Or he'll arrest.
I brought him here so

173
00:08:57,082 --> 00:09:00,132
- you could watch both of 'em.
- What's happening?

174
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,834
Tell her I'm okay, please.

175
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,302
He's okay, Kara.

176
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,945
- It's gonna be dark soon.
- I know.

177
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,672
We had a hard enough time finding
the trail during the daylight.

178
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:12,234
The car came from somewhere.

179
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:14,863
I'm gonna try to find the road.
I'll be fine.

180
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:16,065
All right.

181
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:23,169
What's happening?

182
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:25,594
Nothing. It's just, Jake's having...

183
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,860
Hit the brakes!

184
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:45,096
- Did he drop his drawers? Thank you.
- Gowned and waiting.

185
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,836
- You scared me.

186
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,818
- I thought everybody had left.
- Charlotte and I had a late walk-in.

187
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:52,925
What are you doing here?
I had some work to do.

188
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,555
It's saturday night.

189
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,855
It's not like there's
a lot happening at home.

190
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,015
- True.
- What did you do to him?

191
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,807
It's not our fault. Don't lie to me.

192
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,564
- Have a beer.
- I don't want a beer.

193
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:05,256
- Everybody just calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

194
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:07,531
This was supposed to be
the best night of my life,

195
00:10:07,656 --> 00:10:09,428
and they've ruined it.
My wedding reception

196
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:11,610
is going on right now,
and there is no groom!

197
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,155
You seem very upset right now.

198
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,012
Maybe we can go somewhere
and have a talk?

199
00:10:15,137 --> 00:10:17,511
Is it true about... his thing?

200
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,166
It's not funny!
It's my wedding night.

201
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,791
Come on. I'll take you
to your husband.

202
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,180
I'm okay.

203
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:37,154
- I'm still here.
- Are you okay?

204
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,512
Is she okay?

205
00:10:41,168 --> 00:10:43,018
- You're bleeding.
- What?

206
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:45,580
- I hit my head.
- All right.

207
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:48,905
- It's nothing. I'm okay.
- Let me take a look at it.

208
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,192
- I can't open the door.
- What?

209
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,374
- I can't open the door.
- Here. Help me.

210
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:57,199
- The rock is blocking the door.
- Help me!

211
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:04,945
Can you get out that window?

212
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:15,863
If you can't get out,

213
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:17,813
I can't leave.

214
00:11:18,484 --> 00:11:19,934
Jake, his tubing...

215
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,306
it'll clog...
And he will die.

216
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:24,078
What?

217
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:25,953
- What is it?
- Nothing.

218
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,701
- All right?
- Trying to figure this out.

219
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:30,525
We're gonna have to...

220
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:33,887
probably gonna have
to stay here through...

221
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,020
- wait out the night.
- What?

222
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,362
{\pub}Bourbon, neat.

223
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,672
Can I get you a drink?

224
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:50,399
Thanks, but I've got one coming.

225
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:53,774
Sorry that took so long.
That bartender was a total...

226
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:57,200
- What are you doing here?
- Having a drink.

227
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,953
I can see that. Why are you here?

228
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:01,001
Just like you,
trying to have a little fun.

229
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:02,716
- Maybe I should go.
- Wait.

230
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:04,791
Thanks for the drink, shelly.

231
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,610
- Shelly?
- She came up with that on her own.

232
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:10,488
Hope I didn't ruin your game.

233
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:13,513
Don't worry about it.
I wasn't that interested.

234
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:16,026
- So you trying out the single life?
- I am single.

235
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,008
- Right. Of course.
- What's that supposed to mean?

236
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:22,449
- Nothing. You and Violet...
- Stop. I am not going there.

237
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,138
Tonight is about good booze
and single women, period.

238
00:12:25,263 --> 00:12:27,044
- On the prowl, are you?
- You know...

239
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:29,412
- Trying to prove a point?
- It's a big bar.

240
00:12:29,537 --> 00:12:30,837
Ookay, but look,

241
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,023
we're colleagues now.
Aside from that

242
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:35,748
thing that once came between us,

243
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:37,765
there's no reason why we can't be
friends.

244
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,790
Maybe we would've been
friends if not for

245
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:41,843
that thing we won't talk about.

246
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:43,376
I doubt it.

247
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:47,140
- You stuck a needle in his...
- It's okay, baby. It didn't hurt.

248
00:12:47,511 --> 00:12:48,642
She froze it first.

249
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,013
And so our next option
is to insert a shunt

250
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,688
- to redirect the blood flow.
- A shunt?

251
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:55,369
That sounds big.

252
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:57,344
It is, but it's what I got.

253
00:12:57,613 --> 00:12:59,695
Otherwise I'll have
to deglove the penis.

254
00:13:00,017 --> 00:13:01,017
Deglove?

255
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,240
I make a circular incision
around the glands,

256
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,739
roll back the skin
and squeeze out the blood.

257
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:06,864
Oh, God!

258
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,983
- Feeling better?
- Yeah, a little.

259
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:41,319
So... how long
have you been pregnant?

260
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,008
This wasn't supposed to happen.

261
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,810
When we made our virginity pledge,
everyone

262
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:54,185
made fun of us,

263
00:13:54,753 --> 00:13:56,168
said we were freaks.

264
00:13:57,306 --> 00:13:58,760
But we liked being different.

265
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:01,292
It was our way of saying what
we had together was special.

266
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:04,196
The fact that you couldn't keep
your promise is understandable.

267
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:06,274
No. You don't get it.
We made a pledge.

268
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,782
It's a big commitment.
One that's difficult to keep.

269
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:11,326
That's what Jenny said
at my bachelorette party.

270
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,351
- Who's Jenny?
- My sister.

271
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:16,989
She and her friends
were telling stories

272
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:19,352
about their first time,
how much it hurt.

273
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:22,967
They said I should just do it,
just get it over with.

274
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:27,367
That way, it would be great
when I was with Brendon.

275
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,770
- It's not Brendon's?
- I thought if the wedding night

276
00:14:29,895 --> 00:14:31,776
were close enough,
brendon would think it was.

277
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:35,624
Is that the kind of marriage you want,
a relationship based on a lie?

278
00:14:36,004 --> 00:14:38,004
You're gonna have to tell him.

279
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:44,894
I'm gonna go get Jake.
That way I can help you

280
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,019
and him.

281
00:14:46,616 --> 00:14:48,816
Will he make it through the night?

282
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:55,668
- Yes. If the tube holds, yeah.
- Good.

283
00:14:56,717 --> 00:14:57,817
That's good.

284
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:04,931
It hurts. Something hurts.

285
00:15:06,484 --> 00:15:08,034
I think I'm bleeding.

286
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:13,316
It's not blood.

287
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:16,351
Your water broke. You're in labor.

288
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:24,117
You've played before.

289
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:25,797
I lived for a while on an army post.

290
00:15:25,922 --> 00:15:29,026
There wasn't much to do at night except
go to the bar, drink and play darts.

291
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:30,929
- You were in the army?
- National guard.

292
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,972
I was called up as a reserve doctor
when we invaded Iraq.

293
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:35,347
See any action?

294
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:37,691
Stationed at a veteran's hospital

295
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:40,752
- in Landsthul, Germany.
- I saw some action in Bosnia...

296
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:42,154
doctors without borders.

297
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,058
Had some pretty close calls
in the field.

298
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:45,911
I'm sure burning sage
in a war zone's

299
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:48,347
- quite dangerous.
- Is there something you want to say

300
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:52,103
- about the type of medicine I practice?
- I think I just did.

301
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:54,743
Look. You lose.

302
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:58,161
- Let's go again.
- I'll take your money all night.

303
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:04,884
You're way out of your league
on this one.

304
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:06,559
We'll see about that.

305
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:17,686
What are you doing?

306
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,381
I'm hoping that Violet gets Melissa
to come clean with Brendon.

307
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:22,767
She's pregnant by someone else.

308
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:25,442
- And Violet is involved why?
- Because Brendon needs to know.

309
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,893
Violet should mind her own business.

310
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,772
It was just...

311
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,870
Good. This is good.
This is gonna be good.

312
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,456
- What do you think you're doing?
- Talking to a patient.

313
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,541
- She's not your patient.
- Excuse me?

314
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,956
She's my patient's wife.
He came in for a stuck penis

315
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:45,423
not a relationship-ectomy.

316
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:47,385
No one asked us to insert ourselves

317
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,724
- in their personal life.
- Melissa is upset.

318
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:52,761
- I am helping her to figure out what...
- No, you are doing nothing.

319
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,272
No one is saying anything to anyone.

320
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:57,347
It's my patient and my penis.

321
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,961
Something's wrong.

322
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,305
That's funny. Everything's wrong.

323
00:17:07,256 --> 00:17:09,358
The force of the impact
shifted the baby.

324
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:11,794
- He's in a breech position.
- What does that mean?

325
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:12,969
Is he okay?

326
00:17:13,094 --> 00:17:15,004
It means that his legs
are pointing down.

327
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:17,977
I can't deliver him in this position
without turning him.

328
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:19,673
Don't move. Hold still.

329
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:21,848
I'm gonna try to flip the baby.

330
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,710
It's gonna hurt.

331
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:37,437
Stop.

332
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:44,870
- Did it work?
- I'm sorry.

333
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:49,641
- How are you doing?
- The baby...

334
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:52,959
It's a footling breech.
I can't move him, and he's coming.

335
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:54,985
- How long?
- Soon.

336
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,992
And even if I do manage to turn him,

337
00:17:58,117 --> 00:18:00,047
I don't know if I can deliver
in this position.

338
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:01,985
- We can't wait till sunrise.
- I know.

339
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,597
I'm afraid we're gonna
lose all three of them.

340
00:18:12,686 --> 00:18:14,937
What are you doing
with my tackle box?

341
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:17,846
I'm trying to give you as much time
as possible while I'm gone.

342
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,242
The tubing's loose.
If I can sew it into your skin,

343
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:25,870
- it won't get pulled out of place.
- Which would kill me?

344
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:28,145
I think it'll give you more time.

345
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:30,867
You promise me you'll,
come back, right,

346
00:18:30,992 --> 00:18:32,692
and bring help for Kara?

347
00:18:34,585 --> 00:18:35,585
I promise.

348
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,619
Let's get it over with then,
so you can go.

349
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,621
Okay, everyone.
Visiting hours are over.

350
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:46,630
Let's go, Melissa.
I want her to stay.

351
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:48,255
That's fine with me.

352
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:51,337
- I'll be outside if you need me.
- Will you stay?

353
00:18:51,824 --> 00:18:53,774
Please, so I don't freak out.

354
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:56,926
Great. Party in procedure room one.

355
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,049
I know this might sound
a little forward,

356
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:02,645
but I saw you from over there,

357
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,185
and I think you are... stunning.

358
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,581
You have this unstoppable
sex appeal.

359
00:19:07,706 --> 00:19:10,656
You know, you're like
the niagara falls of sexy.

360
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,986
- That was... terrible.
- Horrific.

361
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:17,446
- I'm Sheldon.
- Dawn.

362
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:20,453
- Can I buy you a drink, Dawn?
- I'd like that.

363
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:22,663
- A margarita.
- A beer and a margarita, please?

364
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,908
While you're at it,
I'll take a bourbon straight up.

365
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,706
- Thanks.
- You two know each other?

366
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,397
- We're colleagues.
- Doctors, actually.

367
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:31,768
- I'm a doctor. Sheldon's a shrink.
- A psychiatrist,

368
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:34,235
which means I have medical
training and emotional depth.

369
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,847
- I bet you're very easy to talk to.
- He is.

370
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:38,833
It's kinda like talking to your dad.

371
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,632
Gee. Look what time it is.

372
00:19:40,757 --> 00:19:42,680
Shouldn't you be getting home
to your baby?

373
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,711
- You have a baby?
- I'm a single parent.

374
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:47,458
- And at his age...
- I got it...

375
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,122
I got it. Put your money away.

376
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:52,547
I'm gonna let you two work this out.

377
00:19:52,672 --> 00:19:54,741
- Excuse me.
- If you insist.

378
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,030
Great. Thank you.

379
00:19:57,798 --> 00:19:59,758
Bringing up Lucas... Low blow.

380
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:02,409
- You drew first blood.
- If you can't stand the heat, get...

381
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,442
See, that's the difference between
you and me. This isn't a game to me.

382
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:08,630
I actually like this girl. I think
she's nice and funny and smart.

383
00:20:08,755 --> 00:20:10,638
And you'd take her home
just to prove a point.

384
00:20:10,763 --> 00:20:12,703
- Excuse me?
- If I'm allowed to use the name,

385
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:14,534
I think you're still in love
with Violet.

386
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:17,422
You know what I think? I think
you're projecting. You're the shrink,

387
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:19,589
I think maybe it's you
who's still hung up on her.

388
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:21,364
I am a shrink,
and clinically speaking,

389
00:20:21,489 --> 00:20:23,298
we would call
what you just said an evasion.

390
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,182
In layman's terms, you're a liar.
You love her.

391
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:29,922
And when she comes around,
you'll regret this.

392
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,466
The shunt's almost in.
Just a few more minutes.

393
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:40,841
This is our wedding night,
and I've ruined it for you.

394
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,737
- Don't say that.
- If this doesn't work,

395
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:46,216
- we'll never be able to do it.
- It's not your fault.

396
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:48,382
I just wanted you to think
that I was some kind of

397
00:20:48,507 --> 00:20:49,689
rock star in bed.

398
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:54,085
I wanted you to think
I was worth waiting for.

399
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:57,797
There's something
I need to tell you.

400
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,509
- Maybe now is not the time.
- Now is definitely not the time.

401
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,784
I'm pregnant.

402
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:05,943
We had a pledge. We agreed...

403
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,516
Wait. You did it with someone else?!

404
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,566
I have a sharp instrument inside you.
If you ever want to use it again,

405
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:13,706
- I suggest you stop squirming.
- How could you?!

406
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:15,815
- She made a mistake.
- This marriage is over.

407
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,484
- We can talk about this but...
- Everyone get out now.

408
00:21:19,122 --> 00:21:20,922
All right. Okay, let's go.

409
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:40,298
I sewed the tube in.
He's exhausted but stable.

410
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:43,816
How's the labor?

411
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:47,177
It's progressing quickly.

412
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:54,350
Okay, don't fall or get hurt
or do anything

413
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,360
that might cause you to die
in this canyon.

414
00:21:58,746 --> 00:22:01,446
- You have to come back.
- Okay. All right.

415
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,139
Be careful.

416
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:37,385
{\pub}{\pos(192,220)}I feel something! Oh, my God.
I feel something.

417
00:22:37,964 --> 00:22:39,014
{\pos(192,220)}What is it?

418
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,919
{\pos(192,220)}It's nothing.

419
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:43,736
{\pos(192,220)}Tell me. Just tell me.

420
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,072
It's bad enough without you
not saying things.

421
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,242
The baby's foot... it's come out
through the cervix.

422
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:50,748
His foot?

423
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,997
I can't deliver him like this.
He'll die.

424
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,735
He's not fully engaged,

425
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,135
so I need to push him back up
through the birth canal

426
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,104
and try to invert him
from the inside.

427
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:02,797
- What? Are you kidding me?!
- It's bad, but you can do this.

428
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,390
Just take a deep breath.

429
00:23:05,515 --> 00:23:07,538
I'm gonna be right here
with you, all right?

430
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:10,346
And we're both just...
We're both just gonna breathe.

431
00:23:11,701 --> 00:23:13,151
Take a deep breath.

432
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,560
Okay, ready?

433
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:21,983
No, I can't! I can't!

434
00:23:22,975 --> 00:23:24,475
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

435
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:29,824
Kara, don't give up on me.
I need you to try.

436
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,040
You can do it, baby.
You can do it.

437
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:36,182
- No, I can't.
- Oh, yes, you can.

438
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,042
You're the most stubborn woman I know.
It's not too hard for you.

439
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,149
- We can do this.
- No, I don't want to. Please.

440
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:44,064
Kara, listen to me.

441
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,696
You know how most times...

442
00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:49,069
You're the one who's always
in charge of us, right?

443
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,470
You decide where we eat,

444
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:53,068
what color
the baby's room's gonna be,

445
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:54,801
where we're gonna go on vacation.

446
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:57,894
And it works 'cause I trust you

447
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,253
and I know you want
what's best for us.

448
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:02,982
Now it's my turn.

449
00:24:03,857 --> 00:24:05,408
I'm the one who's in charge.

450
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:08,371
I'm in charge of us,
and I say you can do this.

451
00:24:08,496 --> 00:24:10,146
So you have to do this.

452
00:24:10,762 --> 00:24:12,212
It's my turn, okay?

453
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,412
I know what's best.
You have to trust me.

454
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,456
Kara... you have to do this.

455
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,161
- Just do it.
- All right?

456
00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:25,983
Let's try again.
Okay? You ready?

457
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:28,245
Okay, here we go.

458
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,847
Come on.
A little bit more. Almost.

459
00:24:38,806 --> 00:24:39,811
Yes!

460
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,215
What just... what happened?
Did she do it?

461
00:24:44,614 --> 00:24:46,109
We did it!

462
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:53,032
- I love you, Kara.
- Oh, I love you, too.

463
00:25:00,785 --> 00:25:03,310
Hey, Melissa's in my office
crying her eyes out.

464
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,756
She says she won't leave
until she talks to Brendon.

465
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:07,425
He doesn't want to speak to her.

466
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,715
You're gonna have to get him
to change his mind.

467
00:25:10,852 --> 00:25:11,884
I get it.

468
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,053
You're a meddler.
You like to meddle.

469
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,574
Meddling makes you happy.

470
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:18,202
But when it comes to my patients,
I'd prefer you stayed away.

471
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,284
We use a team approach here.

472
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:23,987
That means we share advice
or suggestions

473
00:25:24,112 --> 00:25:25,940
or anything
that might help the patient.

474
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,754
Brendon came here for a case
of priapism. Now look where he's at.

475
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:32,085
Look where they're both at. They start
the day their whole lives ahead of them,

476
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,204
happiness within their reach, and...

477
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:36,657
- then it's shattered.
- And who shattered it?

478
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:38,682
Who got her to open her yap?

479
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:43,987
I think you're afraid.

480
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:46,419
I think you're afraid of
getting to know your patients.

481
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:50,590
So you put on
the tough southern girl act,

482
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,873
because to feel
what they're feeling...

483
00:25:54,377 --> 00:25:56,376
That would mean feeling something.

484
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:58,524
Is this the part where I
break out the kleenex

485
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:01,699
cause you think my heart's
darker than Texas coal?

486
00:26:05,993 --> 00:26:09,497
Our patients come here
for healing, Charlotte.

487
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:12,102
So... whether that means a pill

488
00:26:12,227 --> 00:26:14,744
or a bandage or a needle
or a conversation,

489
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:16,069
it's the same.

490
00:26:16,194 --> 00:26:19,035
We listen, and when we can,
we respond.

491
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:20,953
That's what we do here.

492
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,878
No. It's what you do here.

493
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:33,006
You just gonna
stand there all night?

494
00:26:33,131 --> 00:26:34,884
Is there something
else I should be doing?

495
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,993
I think it's customary
for the guy to make the first move.

496
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:41,498
I get it.
This is the move.

497
00:26:41,623 --> 00:26:43,838
You do nothing while you wait
for me to come to you.

498
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:45,399
It worked, didn't it?

499
00:26:45,524 --> 00:26:47,878
Your friend Sheldon,
he doesn't play any games.

500
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:51,149
- His approach is straight up.
- And yet, here you are talking to me.

501
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:54,724
Sadly, I have a weakness for
guys who make me work for it.

502
00:26:58,124 --> 00:27:00,535
Maybe it's time you tried
dating a nice guy instead.

503
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:03,315
You do get that I wanted
to leave with you?

504
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,414
Here you are...
With Pete.

505
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:08,668
- Actually, she was looking for you.
- You were?

506
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:10,268
Really?

507
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:15,478
Yeah. I thought that maybe
we could grab a bite to eat,

508
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:17,635
- get out of here.
- I'd love that.

509
00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:20,386
I will grab my coat and,
meet you at the door.

510
00:27:20,511 --> 00:27:21,511
Okay.

511
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,770
It looks like I got
the girl this time.

512
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:29,105
Looks that way.

513
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:32,608
I'll see you at work monday.

514
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,027
Good news, Brendon.

515
00:27:38,152 --> 00:27:40,139
Not only are you flaccid,
I found no evidence

516
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:42,452
of vascular or neurological damage.

517
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:45,557
You know, I thought I married
the virgin Mary.

518
00:27:46,652 --> 00:27:48,902
Turns out I married Mary Magdalene.

519
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:52,817
I know your heart feels broken
clean through right now,

520
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:55,917
but... if you walk,
you might regret it.

521
00:27:57,103 --> 00:27:58,753
Not after what she did.

522
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:06,029
I'm...

523
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:08,133
Not warm...

524
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:12,194
And feelings are. So I'm gonna
just tell you this thing,

525
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,603
'cause here we do that.

526
00:28:13,728 --> 00:28:16,277
We tell you things,
and sometimes it helps you.

527
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:18,963
Oh, for the love...

528
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:22,811
Anyway, here's the thing
I want to tell you.

529
00:28:24,593 --> 00:28:25,893
I was married...

530
00:28:26,495 --> 00:28:27,495
Once.

531
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,407
I married the first man
I truly loved.

532
00:28:31,532 --> 00:28:34,682
Thought we had this whole
fairy-tale thing going on.

533
00:28:35,735 --> 00:28:36,735
It was.

534
00:28:37,074 --> 00:28:39,175
He was... amazing.

535
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,310
We were amazing.

536
00:28:44,283 --> 00:28:46,183
And then he did something...

537
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,227
Something stupid and thoughtless...

538
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:51,106
Something mean...

539
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:54,331
The kind of something
I was not willing to forgive.

540
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,900
So I left him.

541
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,871
I left him behind and I went on

542
00:28:57,996 --> 00:29:00,396
and I live
this whole other life now.

543
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:01,814
And it's good.

544
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:03,475
It's fine.

545
00:29:03,814 --> 00:29:06,092
I have a great guy, I'm a doctor.

546
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,946
My life is damn near perfect.

547
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,831
But every once in a while,

548
00:29:11,188 --> 00:29:12,788
I think about that guy

549
00:29:13,713 --> 00:29:15,763
and the fairy-tale thing we had

550
00:29:16,813 --> 00:29:20,613
and... I wonder if we'd still be
amazing if we were together now.

551
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,344
And I'll never know...

552
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,607
'cause the minute it got hard,

553
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:29,432
the minute it stopped being
a fairy tale...

554
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:31,010
I cut and ran.

555
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:34,271
Real life is hard.
Real stuff takes work.

556
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:37,639
Real life is sometimes
thoughtless and mean.

557
00:29:39,382 --> 00:29:41,782
But that doesn't
cancel out the love.

558
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:44,367
So if you don't love this girl,

559
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:45,492
walk away.

560
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,302
But if you look at her

561
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:51,056
and you know she's the one...

562
00:29:52,408 --> 00:29:55,508
You owe it to yourself
to give her a second chance.

563
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:02,508
- Lift your butt then push.
- No! I can't move.

564
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:05,470
The baby can't come out, Kara,
until you push. Now lift.

565
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,972
- You can do it. You can do it, baby.
- I can't!

566
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:09,890
Kara, look at me.

567
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,892
Kara, look at me.

568
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,051
We are both trapped in this car.

569
00:30:14,176 --> 00:30:16,199
We are both scared...
terrified... all right?

570
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:18,946
But you have a guy outside
this car who is waiting for you.

571
00:30:19,071 --> 00:30:20,953
You have a guy who loves you.

572
00:30:21,078 --> 00:30:23,568
Now if you don't do what I
tell you to do, you will die.

573
00:30:23,693 --> 00:30:25,142
You will die on him.

574
00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:27,518
Now if I die,
nobody's really gonna care.

575
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:29,753
They'll care,
but they won't be broken.

576
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:32,371
If you die, you will break him.

577
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,280
Jake will be broken.

578
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,982
Someone loves you.

579
00:30:36,107 --> 00:30:38,065
So we're not gonna sit here
and debate this.

580
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,505
When I tell you to push, you are
damn well going to push! Right?

581
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,801
So push!

582
00:30:44,065 --> 00:30:45,065
Push!

583
00:30:45,674 --> 00:30:47,274
Good. All right. Good.

584
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,249
Baby's out. The baby's out.

585
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:51,801
How is he?

586
00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:55,248
Is he okay?
Is he okay?

587
00:30:56,563 --> 00:31:00,367
Oh... no. He can't be...
You have to help him.

588
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:02,141
You have to help him.

589
00:31:03,855 --> 00:31:04,855
Help him.

590
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,847
You have to help him.

591
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,376
- He's okay?
- Well, first of all,

592
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:22,006
someone missed something
on the ultrasound,

593
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,340
because he is a she.

594
00:31:24,886 --> 00:31:26,071
And, yes...

595
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:29,285
She's okay.

596
00:31:33,444 --> 00:31:34,935
She's so beautiful.

597
00:31:36,344 --> 00:31:39,526
- And everything's...
- Ten fingers, ten toes.

598
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:43,084
Jake, we had a girl.
Jake, it's a girl.

599
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:48,624
Jake, your daughter is gorgeous!

600
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:12,304
Can you hear me?

601
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,014
Do you see him?
Is he moving?

602
00:32:27,494 --> 00:32:29,144
Get the repelling team!

603
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,129
Sam! We had the baby.
But jake... how's jake?

604
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,218
Tell me he's alive.
Tell me!

605
00:32:48,148 --> 00:32:49,498
He's still alive!

606
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,761
EMT's almost there.

607
00:32:52,886 --> 00:32:55,041
We're gonna have to
pull him up in the helicopter.

608
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:59,101
Give me a backboard, IV of normal saline
and 02 on a rebreather.

609
00:32:59,732 --> 00:33:01,461
- You got it.
- Way to hang in there.

610
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:03,469
We're gonna get you outta here.

611
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:13,024
You're gonna be in good hands, man.

612
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:14,773
- Well done.
- Careful.

613
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:17,275
Listen, I don't want to go, okay?
I don't want to go...

614
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,873
- She's right behind you.
- I don't want to go without Kara.

615
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,048
She's gonna catch up
with you at the hospital.

616
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:24,740
- Take care of Kara. Promise me.
- I got you. Good job, buddy.

617
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:31,050
So they're gonna have you guys
outta here in a couple of minutes.

618
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,852
- How is he?
- He lost a lot of blood,

619
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,096
- but I think he's gonna be okay.
- And the baby?

620
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,431
Paramedics have her on O2.
She's nice and pink.

621
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,640
- You guys did good.
- Door's coming off now.

622
00:33:39,765 --> 00:33:41,714
- We need you to stand clear.
- Thank you

623
00:33:42,182 --> 00:33:44,063
- Just, thank you.
- You don't have to...

624
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:47,816
I do. And I swear,
when we get outta here,

625
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:50,501
I am naming that baby Addison.

626
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:53,739
That's good. That's good.
I'm bringing 'em in. All right.

627
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,458
Hold up! Hold up!

628
00:34:04,936 --> 00:34:08,045
- Sam! She's crashing.
- She's losing blood!

629
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,798
The pressure from the door must have
tamponaded the wound.

630
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,675
She's crashing!
She's crashing!

631
00:34:20,278 --> 00:34:21,934
Brendon, I know you're still angry.

632
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,603
Damn right, I'm angry.
I'm pissed...

633
00:34:25,198 --> 00:34:26,448
And humiliated.

634
00:34:27,546 --> 00:34:28,607
I'm so sorry.

635
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,419
I never wanted to see you again.

636
00:34:33,464 --> 00:34:34,464
But?

637
00:34:40,932 --> 00:34:41,932
But...

638
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:44,207
I look at you, and...

639
00:34:46,192 --> 00:34:48,042
I'm not ready to walk away.

640
00:34:50,864 --> 00:34:51,914
I love you.

641
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,136
Keep off it for a couple days.

642
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,317
What just happened here?

643
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:10,524
Guess he didn't want
to give up on her.

644
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,360
Now that was a long night.
Who's up for some food?

645
00:35:13,772 --> 00:35:15,745
- My treat.
- I'll go get my stuff.

646
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:21,075
So that was a good thing you did,

647
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,518
convincing Brendon
to give her another chance.

648
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:26,160
Is there any privacy in this office?

649
00:35:26,747 --> 00:35:28,707
Does Cooper know you were married?

650
00:35:29,142 --> 00:35:30,142
I wasn't.

651
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:33,510
Brendon and Melissa
are back together.

652
00:35:33,635 --> 00:35:35,674
They're happy. That's all
that matters, right?

653
00:35:37,421 --> 00:35:38,969
Why don't I believe you?

654
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,970
- Let it go, Violet.
- Were you lying?

655
00:35:42,095 --> 00:35:45,041
You know, it's not actually morning,
but I think I'm having pancakes.

656
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,740
- I'm having banana pancakes.
- On second thought, I think,

657
00:35:47,865 --> 00:35:51,106
I got a lot of work
to finish up, so...

658
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:03,293
Charge the paddles.

659
00:36:05,603 --> 00:36:07,456
You heard me.
Charge the paddles.

660
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,750
Addison, it's been 20 minutes.

661
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:14,611
She's gone.

662
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
She's gone.
Addison. Addison!

663
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:22,225
She's gone.

664
00:36:38,384 --> 00:36:39,984
Get me outta this car.

665
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:43,501
I want out of this car.

666
00:36:44,053 --> 00:36:45,577
Get me out.

667
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,702
Get me out of this car.

668
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,606
Get me out of this car!

669
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,297
Get me out!
Get me out of this car!

670
00:38:21,347 --> 00:38:23,647
I have something I need to tell you.

671
00:39:28,586 --> 00:39:31,943
I know it's a bit early
for scotch, but...

672
00:39:33,591 --> 00:39:35,091
It's 5:00 somewhere.

673
00:39:36,887 --> 00:39:38,751
Oh, boy.

674
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,882
You remember
when medicine was simple?

675
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,560
We could save people's lives,

676
00:39:49,685 --> 00:39:51,385
people didn't die and...

677
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,320
Bad things didn't happen.

678
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,476
Bad things always happen.

679
00:40:02,256 --> 00:40:03,908
So me and you?

680
00:40:07,899 --> 00:40:09,619
You never answered my question.

681
00:40:12,275 --> 00:40:14,425
Do you think we would've made it?

682
00:40:15,557 --> 00:40:16,907
Oh, I don't know.

683
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,132
I don't know
if we even had chemistry.

684
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,864
I was just a geek
going for the hot girl.

685
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:24,692
I was the hot girl?

686
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:28,942
You were hot.

687
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:31,672
You weren't a geek.

688
00:41:01,898 --> 00:41:03,298
You had not Naomi.

689
00:41:04,884 --> 00:41:06,284
You had not Derek.

690
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,488
