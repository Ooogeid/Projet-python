1
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,359
This music, it's so...

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,206
Is that a review
or a contraction?

3
00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:13,566
Both.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,566
It's resonance therapy.

5
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:16,082
Combined with acupuncture,

6
00:00:16,252 --> 00:00:17,645
It's gonna get those
contractions under control

7
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:19,556
Good thing Matthew
couldn't make it today...

8
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:23,047
because he would hate this.
It's soothing.

9
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:23,679
okay.

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,274
You know, when dr. Bennett
did the I.V.F.,

11
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,810
She let us bring in
our own c.D.
What'd you put on?

12
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:31,246
Well, the first time we just
picked all these songs

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,215
That we used to love
in high school.

14
00:00:33,249 --> 00:00:35,117
And then...
the second time

15
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:37,753
We used this muzak that was
supposed to relax me,

16
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,222
But just made me feel
like I was having

17
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:42,724
A gynecological appointment
in an elevator.

18
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,627
And then the third time,
we just picked every song

19
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:48,664
That we could think of with
the word "luck" in the title.
And it worked.

20
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:50,132
ah.
You okay?

21
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,600
don't worry.

22
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,102
It's just--it's been like this
the past couple of mornings.

23
00:00:55,337 --> 00:00:57,838
I think baby langston does not
like breakfast burritos.

24
00:00:57,873 --> 00:01:01,275
Okay. You start your torture,
and I'll just run a te--ah!

25
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:03,777
Ah! Ooh.
Okay, hang on.

26
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:05,479
Send naomi in, please.

27
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:07,514
Sorry. It's not usually
this bad.

28
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:09,483
Mm.
Okay,
focus on your breathing.

29
00:01:09,517 --> 00:01:11,418
Ooh.
Slow and deep.

30
00:01:11,453 --> 00:01:13,420
Shira, what's wrong?

31
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:15,823
Strengthening contractions,
a minute apart.
Oh!

32
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:18,125
Oh, this could be real labor.
At 25 weeks?

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,661
can you make it stop?
Well, we can,

34
00:01:20,695 --> 00:01:23,964
But we're gonna have to
get you to the hospital.
I'm all wet.

35
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:27,101
I think my water just broke.

36
00:01:27,135 --> 00:01:29,036
It's blood.

37
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:34,475
Thanks.

38
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:36,010
Hey.
Hey.

39
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:37,945
I was
just thinking about you.

40
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,581
Oh, yeah?I't
what to wear to maya's wedding.

41
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:41,715
Oh.

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,951
Uh... Whatever.

43
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:46,387
Sam, women don't do well
with "whatever."

44
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:50,491
well,
what are you gonna wear?

45
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:51,892
what?

46
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:54,328
Uh, I have a million things
to do to get ready,

47
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:56,797
And picking out a tie is not
high up on the list.

48
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:59,633
What is high on the list?

49
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:01,568
I have to write a toast.

50
00:02:01,603 --> 00:02:03,971
Oh, I'm good at toasts.
Yeah, I know. I know that.

51
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:06,573
I-I knocked on your door
last night,

52
00:02:06,608 --> 00:02:09,009
Hoping that you could help...
But I-I wasn't home.

53
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:10,177
Yeah.

54
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:12,846
Look, you, uh, you don't
want this to be weird.

55
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:15,149
And--and I'm trying
to make this not weird.

56
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:18,152
But, uh, you weren't--
you weren't home.

57
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:20,354
Yeah. I was... Out.

58
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:25,726
Look, sam,
I'm just gonna say this,

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,628
And hopefully,
you're gonna understand,

60
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:30,998
And it won't be weird
and...

61
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:32,866
I'm seeing someone.

62
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,103
addison.

63
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:38,605
There's an ambulance downstairs.
We need you.

64
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,507
It's an emergency.

65
00:02:44,813 --> 00:02:47,848
It's a placental abruption.
This much blood, the placenta
could be completely detached.

66
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:50,517
It's gonna be hard
to control the hemorrhage

67
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:53,821
And get that baby out
fast enough.
Oh, no, please.
He's not ready yet.

68
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,859
Do you have any terbutaline?
I don't know if we do.

69
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:02,262
The book says that he's
the size of a cucumber.
There's no terbutaline,
no magnesium sulfate.

70
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:04,565
Can she make it?
I can already feel
the baby's head.

71
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,734
No, no, please.
This baby's coming now.

72
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:08,235
No!

73
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,045
We're gonna get you into surgery
and get your bleeding stopped.

74
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,014
Your husband's on his way.
The baby?

75
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:22,483
Dr. Montgomery's with him.
He was so small.
Will he be okay?

76
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:25,586
She's gonna do everything
she can for him.
But will he be okay?

77
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:29,056
I didn't feel... Anything

78
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,493
'cause the doctor...
And I was counting...

79
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:35,930
They didn't nick his brain
or anything, right?
You know, they go in
through the groin

80
00:03:35,964 --> 00:03:37,898
For a hernia repair,
so I doubt it.

81
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:40,467
I just think ike has a little
bit of an anesthesia hangover.

82
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:43,637
Dr. Scott.
Hey. I'm so sorry, buddy.
They made me scrub in

83
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:46,373
On another surgery
right after yours.

84
00:03:46,408 --> 00:03:48,909
Wasn't nearly as cool,
though.
So everything went okay here?

85
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:51,745
Yeah, absolutely.
I sutured in a mesh patch.

86
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,914
Gonna last him a lifetime.
Great. So how long is he
gonna be kinda...

87
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:56,684
Oh, he'll be himself
in an hour or so.
I am myself.

88
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:59,253
Listen, just let him,
uh, rest a while.

89
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:01,889
I'll swing by and check him.

90
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:04,625
You're gonna be outta here
before dinner.
Thank you.

91
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,260
Take care.

92
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:09,597
Oh, man, I'll tell you.
I jacked up my back.

93
00:04:09,631 --> 00:04:11,465
I'm sorry to hear that.

94
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:14,368
Yeah, I was playing that,
uh, computer tennis game.

95
00:04:14,402 --> 00:04:16,637
I realize
it's a goofy injury.

96
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:18,606
But, you know,
the last few days

97
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,841
I've been, uh, eating
fistfuls of ibuprofen

98
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:22,943
Just so I can stand up
in the o.R.

99
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:24,912
Actually, man,
would you mind, uh,

100
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:27,648
Writing me a prescription
for a couple of oxy?

101
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:30,584
Oxy a little heavy
for a gaming injury?
Ah, it's just two or three,

102
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:32,519
Just to get me through
today and tomorrow.

103
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:35,990
Then I'm gonna take
the weekend off and rest up.

104
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:37,458
Hey, listen, if--if--ow.

105
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:40,728
If it's a big deal,
don't worry about it.

106
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:43,063
I'll suck it up.

107
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:48,602
Hey.

108
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:49,670
Hey.

109
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:51,839
You want
to grab lunch later,

110
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:54,541
Away from here?

111
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:57,611
I can do that.

112
00:04:57,646 --> 00:04:59,546
Oh, hey. You know--

113
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:01,348
You know charlotte king,
don't you?

114
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:03,617
Yeah.

115
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:05,719
Yeah.

116
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:07,888
Oh, is he the doc that--

117
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:10,291
Yeah.
Oh, I see.

118
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:13,294
I hope this isn't
gonna be a thing.
It's not a thing.

119
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:15,963
Okay. Great.

120
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:19,099
I'll call you later.
Mm.

121
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,701
Problem with this?

122
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:23,003
Not a thing.

123
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,607
You don't rsvp two days
before a wedding.

124
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:29,476
I'm sorry. My friends
have never done this.

125
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:32,012
You better watch that tone,
young--

126
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:34,248
All right. We're gonna
talk about this later.

127
00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:36,250
I don't even care
if they come.

128
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:39,019
If it's gonna be
this big a deal--
enough about the wedding.

129
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:42,823
Well, if you're done,
she has an appointment.

130
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:51,332
You okay?

131
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:54,401
He looks like his head
is about to pop off.
Don't tell anybody,
but around here,

132
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:57,271
It always looks like your dad's
head's about to pop off.

133
00:05:57,305 --> 00:06:00,975
I guess I should be happy
he's coming at all.
I'm sorry about your mom.

134
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:04,011
She's making me feel like
I'm doing something wrong.
Did you try
talking to her again?

135
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,247
Well, you know, I-I know
how hard this is.

136
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:08,716
I mean, I member.

137
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,585
U know, heather and her mo
they never got past it.

138
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:15,389
But with your mom...
I think you should try again.
I don't think
my dad would like it.

139
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:19,326
He's mad at her.
Well, it's your wedding, maya.

140
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:22,963
Does he really need
all of that?

141
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:25,966
He weighs less than 2 pounds,
so we need to keep him

142
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,202
Under the lights to regulate
his body temperature.

143
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:29,636
We're also trying to correct

144
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:31,739
A pretty serious
electrolyte imbalance

145
00:06:31,773 --> 00:06:33,240
That's causing convulsions

146
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:35,909
And exacerbating
a cerebral hemorrhage.
His brain is bleeding?

147
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:38,312
How can he have
so many problems?

148
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:41,382
25 weeks is just the cusp
of viability.

149
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,584
Addison, his abdomen
is distended.

150
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:46,353
Yeah, we did an x-ray.

151
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:50,024
He has
necrotizing enterocolitis.

152
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,328
I-I don't know
what that is.

153
00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:55,929
it means that

154
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:58,465
Not enough blood is getting
to his digestive tract.

155
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,535
His intestines are dying.
Is that somethin
you can fix?

156
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:03,937
he'd need surgery

157
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:07,808
To try to resect his bowel
and save some of the intestines.

158
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:09,243
Matthew.

159
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:11,645
So this surgery...
Can we do it now?

160
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,581
Uh, that's up to
dr. Montgomery.

161
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:18,619
You need to understand

162
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:21,455
That it wouldn't be
just one surgery.

163
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:23,924
There would be a whole series
of surgeries.

164
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,294
And in between, he would need
to eat through a feeding tube

165
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:30,464
And breathe with the help
of a ventilator.

166
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:31,899
He'd be suffering.

167
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:34,768
And even if we did manage
to keep him alive,

168
00:07:34,803 --> 00:07:37,704
It's unlikely that we could give
him any kind of normal life.

169
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:41,408
You need to consider if... This
is something that you want.

170
00:07:42,944 --> 00:07:44,912
What's our alternative?

171
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:50,017
Ending his life?

172
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:51,819
Yes.

173
00:07:58,237 --> 00:08:00,772
That's not a life--
shuttling back and forth

174
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:03,908
Between the o.R. And nicu,
being kept alive by machines,

175
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,977
His system
overloaded with drugs.

176
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:07,445
He's their child,

177
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,514
And none of us can say
we know what's gonna happen.

178
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:11,716
Odds are you're right.
I am right.

179
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:15,120
There have been cases where
severe enterocolitis resolves.
So you're on the side
of miracles now?

180
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:17,022
I understand why they are,

181
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:20,325
And I'm not gonna
fault them for it.
I am not faulting them,
but...

182
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:21,760
That baby is suffering.

183
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:23,795
He's only
a couple of hours old,

184
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:26,131
And you can already see it
in his face.

185
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:29,134
You can hear it in his cries.
He's in pain.

186
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:31,236
Letting go is not giving up.
It would be them

187
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,540
Putting the baby's best
interests ahead of their own.
Naomi?

188
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:38,576
You know, kids don't come
with guarantees.

189
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,545
They come with problems.

190
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:42,013
These problems
can't be solved.

191
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:43,948
A lot of problems
can't be solved.

192
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,017
You just... You learn
to live with it.

193
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:48,486
No one should have to live
with this.

194
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,089
No, we're not gonna tell
the coles what to do.

195
00:08:51,123 --> 00:08:54,659
They have to decide
what they can live with.
But I'd have to do
the surgery,

196
00:08:54,693 --> 00:08:57,562
So I need to decide
what I can live with.

197
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:02,567
Corinne... Hey, what are you--
what are you doing here?

198
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:05,269
Oh, I told maya I'd pick
her up. She came in to do--

199
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:09,006
A prenatal appointment.
Yeah, I know.
I'm taking
my daughter-in-law-to-be

200
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,008
On a mini spa day--
massage, facials,

201
00:09:11,043 --> 00:09:14,011
And then a test run
for her makeup and hair.

202
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:16,914
Uh, I--
I'm just trying to
make this special for maya.

203
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:19,083
I think the wedding
will be special enough.

204
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:21,886
Well, if we just go through
the motions,

205
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,522
Do you really think
it will be?

206
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:26,958
I-I know this isn't what
you or naomi wanted.

207
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:29,093
It's--it's not
what I wanted, either,

208
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:31,562
But it's
what's going to happen.

209
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:34,232
So I've made peace with it
as best I can,

210
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,234
And now I feel
we should make this

211
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:39,303
As positive an experience
as we can for the kids.

212
00:09:39,338 --> 00:09:42,407
So is maya here?

213
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:45,376
It's not a thing,
but the guy's a surgeon.

214
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:48,012
Who's dating charlotte.
That has nothing to do
with the fact

215
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,981
That he hit me up
for a prescription.

216
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:52,216
He barely knows me,
and he's asking me for narcotics

217
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:55,319
That would slow him down,
impair his judgment.
Well, look, look, look.
I am on antidepressants.

218
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:57,555
Sometimes it makes it hard
to focus, which is not ideal

219
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:00,258
When I'm in therapy.
Sam's on allergy meds.

220
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:02,927
When he ups his dose,
it knocks him out.

221
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:05,396
You just have to hope that
someone's gonna be responsible.

222
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:08,433
Do--do you have any reason to
think that scott wouldn't be?
Nothing concrete,

223
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,568
But when he saw
that I was uncomfortable,

224
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:14,305
He backed off fast,
and it felt practiced.
Well, he--I've heard
he's a good surgeon.

225
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,808
He seems like a good guy.
What, you've met him?

226
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:18,810
Oh, she had him to the house,
didn't she?

227
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:21,579
My god, she gives it up fast.
Cooper, y--

228
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:24,982
What, what, am I wrong?
he has not actually
been to the house.

229
00:10:25,017 --> 00:10:27,485
He's just...
Picked her up there.

230
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,887
But I don't think
that they're--

231
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:33,391
Yeah, well, you're just
saying that to be nice.
But she is bringing him
to maya's wedding.

232
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,393
He's her plus one.
I have the list.

233
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,728
I have all the lists--
caterers, deejays, florists.

234
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,597
I am knee-deep in wedding,

235
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:42,667
And the sad part is, I have
never had one of my own.
That is sad, but back to me.

236
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:44,969
No one told me that plus one
was an option.

237
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:47,238
Cooper, the wedding
is in two days.

238
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,575
If you are thinking of
scaring up some random hoochie--
oh, no, I'm thinking about
inviting jordana sampson.

239
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,610
Is she back in town?

240
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:55,179
Mm-hmm.
cooper, no.

241
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:58,282
She's not random
and she's not a hoochie.
I know, but she's--

242
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,384
Exactly.

243
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,353
You didn't take that
personally, did you?

244
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:04,355
Is there a reason I should?
No, no.

245
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,157
Then I won't.
Me either.

246
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:07,825
It's
a professional disagreement.

247
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,628
Yes.

248
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:15,266
So... Are you
still good with...

249
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,268
Yes. I think so.

250
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,836
I don't know.

251
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:22,607
I told sam this morning
that I was seeing someone.

252
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,309
I thought we weren't gonna--
no, we're not. It's just--

253
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:27,745
He came to my house last night.
I wasn't home.

254
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:30,882
I didn't want to lie to him.
You didn't tell him
it was me?

255
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,350
No, no.

256
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:35,219
You haven't told anyone,
have you, like violet?

257
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:39,156
I... I wouldn't even know
what to say.

258
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:41,993
Because... This...

259
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:43,027
Mm-hmm.

260
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:45,162
With us...

261
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:46,264
Mm-hmm.

262
00:11:46,298 --> 00:11:47,698
We're just...

263
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:50,501
Just getting through
what we're getting through.

264
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:52,904
Mm-hmm. We're just
helping each other...
Mm.

265
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:54,872
Helping each other feel good.

266
00:11:54,907 --> 00:11:57,441
Really... Really good.

267
00:11:57,476 --> 00:12:02,046
Want to see
if that door locks?

268
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:12,189
Maya.
What are you doing here?

269
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:14,225
I want you
to come to my wedding.

270
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,863
Even though you're not proud
of me, I kof course I love you.

271
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:22,333
Do you think it would be better
if I didn't get married?
Yes.

272
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,570
I-I... I don't know.
It wouldn't.

273
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:29,707
I'm just trying to do
the right thing, but I need you.
You needed me
long before this,

274
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:32,176
But somehow, even though
I tried, I wasn't there for you.

275
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,178
And so for me to sit down

276
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,180
In front of god
and everyone we know

277
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,049
For a formal, public reminder

278
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:42,053
Of how badly I screwed up
your life, I--
that's not
what my wedding is.

279
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:44,789
That's what
it would be to me.

280
00:12:51,558 --> 00:12:54,459
The whole time we were
trying to get pregnant,

281
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:56,929
Matthew kept telling me to
visualize what it would be like

282
00:12:58,763 --> 00:13:01,632
When we were in the hospital,
when we were finally a family.
Yeah.

283
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,101
After a while,
I-I wanted to stop.

284
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:06,069
It's just too hard,
you know?

285
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:08,238
And it just felt like
it was never gonna happen.

286
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:10,974
But matthew...
he kept promising it would.

287
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:13,010
He called the baby
"our dream deferred."

288
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:15,679
Oh, like the poem.

289
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:17,147
Langston hughes.
Yeah.

290
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:19,216
We're english teachers.

291
00:13:21,953 --> 00:13:24,621
Can I--can I hold him now?

292
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:27,758
Oh, we can't--
we can't take him out.

293
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:30,127
Even for a minute?
I'm sorry.

294
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:32,229
So how soon
can we do this surgery?

295
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:33,730
I told matthew,

296
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:36,233
At the rate the baby's bowel
function is deteriorating,

297
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:38,669
You'd have to do
the operation today, right?

298
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:41,471
It's what they want
for their child,

299
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:44,941
And I told them, if anybody
can help them here, it's you.

300
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:47,644
dr. Montgomery...

301
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,880
Please.

302
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:53,750
I'll book an o.R.

303
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:56,653
He was supposed to discharge ike
almost two hours ago.

304
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:59,189
We kept paging him.
I'm really sorry.

305
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:02,059
I said dr. Stt
was probably busy

306
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:04,895
Sewing someone's brains
back in.
Well, there might have been
an emergency

307
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:08,098
Where he was sewing
somebody's something back in.
Still--

308
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,134
No, I--he should not have left
you hanging. I'm really sorry.

309
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:14,304
All right.
You're all set to go.
I hope that follow-up
is the only thing

310
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:16,440
That he's careless about.

311
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,143
I heard there was
a problem with your patient.

312
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:22,579
No. Actually, there's
a problem with your boyfriend.

313
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,315
He asked me for oxy
this morning, now he's m.I.A.

314
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:27,818
And you're assuming what?

315
00:14:27,852 --> 00:14:30,153
He has a bad back.
Well, as his girlfriend,

316
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:31,621
I'm sure
you're very sympathetic.

317
00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:33,957
But as chief of staff
of the hospital where he works,

318
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:35,792
I think
you should be concerned

319
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:37,728
About how he's treating it...
If it's his back.

320
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:41,198
If you want to make
a formal complaint, do it.

321
00:14:41,232 --> 00:14:44,167
That's what I thought.

322
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:49,706
Hey.

323
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:51,675
Hey.

324
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:53,143
You working on the toast?

325
00:14:53,177 --> 00:14:55,712
trying.

326
00:14:55,747 --> 00:14:57,781
Look, sam,
about what I said--

327
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:00,584
We don't need to talk about it.
It's none of my business--
no, sam--

328
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:02,486
Addison, please.
Not today, okay?

329
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,822
I-I c--I can barely
get through this.

330
00:15:05,857 --> 00:15:08,125
What do you want to say?

331
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:10,060
I want to tell them stop,

332
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:11,962
You know,
and don't make this any worse.

333
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:13,997
I just tried
to give that speech.

334
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:16,666
A patient of pete's
gave birth to a preemie--

335
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:20,637
25 weeks, just...
so many problems.

336
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,939
Best-case scenario,
it lives in the nicu

337
00:15:22,974 --> 00:15:25,776
Until I can't do
any more surgeries

338
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,845
Or give it any more drugs.
Are you and pete in sync?

339
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,981
You said
it was pete's patient, right?

340
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:32,716
Right. It is.

341
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,251
But we're not in sync.

342
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:36,119
I am a-about to go remove

343
00:15:36,154 --> 00:15:38,088
Most of the baby's
intestinal tract

344
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:40,390
Because the parents
are hoping for a miracle,

345
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:42,893
And pete doesn't want
to take that away from them,

346
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:44,828
And I couldn't say no.

347
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,798
So I gotta clear my schedule
and head back to the hospital.

348
00:15:47,832 --> 00:15:51,168
Well, I get that--doing things
you don't want to do.

349
00:15:51,202 --> 00:15:53,537
I'm supposed to make
this big speech

350
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:56,473
That makes everybody
feel good about the wedding...

351
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:58,675
Pretend like everything's okay.

352
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,478
Sometimes
weave to pretend.

353
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:10,487
Eloping?

354
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:13,657
Oh. No, noi'm just taking
the dress to get steamed.

355
00:16:13,691 --> 00:16:15,525
It's--it's maya's.

356
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,093
I figured.

357
00:16:17,128 --> 00:16:20,163
Yeah. Well, you know,
it should be a pretty odd event.

358
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:23,800
You know, uh, cooper's bringing
jordana sampson.

359
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:25,468
She's back?

360
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:27,170
Oh, wow.
I know.

361
00:16:27,205 --> 00:16:29,539
Y-you're not bringing
someone else are you,

362
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:31,107
A-a plus one?

363
00:16:31,142 --> 00:16:34,010
Uh, because among other things,
I'm the rsvp girl,

364
00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:35,979
So, um, I'm just,
uh, making sure.

365
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:38,348
Nope. Just me. You?

366
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:40,016
Same.

367
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:43,920
I'll seeou there.

368
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:54,164
Hey. You were supposed to
discharge ike holden.

369
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:56,633
I had to come over here
just so they could go home.

370
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,568
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's my... My back.

371
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:00,437
It was killing me.

372
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:03,206
I-I laid down.
I guess I just went out.

373
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:05,809
Come on.
I know what you're thinking.

374
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:08,612
You think because I asked you
for a-a courtesy prescription,

375
00:17:08,646 --> 00:17:10,513
What, you think now
I'm--I'm a drug addict

376
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:12,949
Who crashed out here?
Tell me you haven't
taken anything.

377
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:14,718
I-I took one oxy.

378
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,187
I don't have
any other surgeries scheduled.,?

379
00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:19,155
As long as you're not
cutting someone open,

380
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,057
Anything short of that,

381
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:23,360
It's okay that you
show up here like this?
Listen, I'm really sorry

382
00:17:23,394 --> 00:17:25,862
That it bothers you that I'm
seeing your ex-girlfriend.
It bothers me

383
00:17:25,897 --> 00:17:28,832
That you couldn't do your job
right now and you're still here.
I have never had
a single problem,

384
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:32,168
In this hospital
or any other.
You want that to change?

385
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:34,671
Are you threatening me?

386
00:17:36,374 --> 00:17:39,609
I think you should go talk
to my colleague--violet turner.

387
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:42,078
She has a lot of experience
treating people with addiction--

388
00:17:42,113 --> 00:17:44,047
you want me to see a shrink?

389
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:46,650
Convince her you don't have
a problem, I will lay off.

390
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:49,686
And if I don't?
We will let
this hospital sort it out.

391
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,087
You know,

392
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:53,790
Somehow I think charlotte's
already decided about me.

393
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,425
Maybe, but I haven't.

394
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:03,233
How's it going?

395
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:07,437
Addison?

396
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:08,972
Addison?

397
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:11,107
There are no clear margins.

398
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:13,643
The entire bowel
is involve

399
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:16,313
There's nothing left
I can save.

400
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,183
Is there anything
you can do?

401
00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:23,453
I can close him up.

402
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:32,655
But he survived
the surgery.
Yes, he survived, but--

403
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,225
Then there must be
something you can do.

404
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:37,827
Your baby doesn't have
a functioning digestive system.

405
00:18:37,862 --> 00:18:39,829
So before
I could do anything,

406
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:41,765
I'd have to put
a central line in

407
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,968
Through his stomach
to feed him.

408
00:18:45,002 --> 00:18:47,670
And how long would he
have to have that?
Permanently.

409
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:50,507
And although I was able
to stop the cerebral bleed,

410
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,809
We have to assume
that there is

411
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:56,346
At least
moderate brain damage.
But you don't know that
for sure.

412
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,882
No, I don't know that
for sure.

413
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,850
But it's more than likely
the case.

414
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:03,420
Just like the longer
we keep him on a respirator,

415
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:04,821
The more likely it is

416
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:07,390
That he'll have retinal failure
or that he'll go blind.

417
00:19:07,425 --> 00:19:10,060
I'm not saying
there aren't miracles,

418
00:19:10,094 --> 00:19:12,729
But at a certain point,
it's not fair to the baby--

419
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:15,532
To langston--
to keep waiting for them.

420
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,000
What are the odds?

421
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:19,269
I want to know the odds.

422
00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:23,873
Of a baby like langston
living outside the nicu?

423
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:24,675
Less than 1%.

424
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:27,411
But it could happen?

425
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:29,480
And it's our decision?

426
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:32,116
Uh, yeah, it is.

427
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,318
But he's in pain.

428
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:36,754
And with so little
to hope for, I'm sorry,

429
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:39,657
I'm not comfortable
performing another surgery.

430
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:44,061
Are there other doctors
that we can get to help us?

431
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:47,098
Yes, you could find someone se
to put in a central line.

432
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:49,166
Then that's
what we'll do.

433
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:52,736
will you please help us?

434
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:54,839
I'm sorry.

435
00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:58,375
I understand if you want
to go a different way,

436
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,511
But I can't.

437
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:08,018
So are the--
are the drugs something new?

438
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:09,620
"the drugs".

439
00:20:09,654 --> 00:20:12,189
The drugs
are the occasional oxy

440
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:15,226
That I take
when my back flares up.

441
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,329
You know what? Here you go.

442
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:20,998
Take 'em, toss 'em,
eat 'em.

443
00:20:21,032 --> 00:20:22,299
Do whatever.

444
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:25,102
That tell you
what you need to know?
Uh, well,

445
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:27,104
The fact that you are carrying
narcotics in your pocket

446
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:30,074
Tells me that you may have
a more serious problem

447
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:32,643
Than you're admitting.
It's funny how much you sound
like your buddy cooper.

448
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:35,646
This has nothing to do
with him.
This has everythg
to do with him.

449
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,481
He resents
my dating charlotte.

450
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:39,416
He can't seriously
call into question my judgment

451
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:41,952
Or my hand skills
or anything else that matters.

452
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:44,822
So he's trying to make me out
to be some kind of junkie,

453
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:47,758
And you're helping him.
I'm just asking questions,
trying to understand.

454
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:50,594
And I'm certainly
not forcing you to stay here.
No, cooper is.

455
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:53,430
You're free to leave.
I do that, he makes an issue
of it with charlotte.

456
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:57,501
Does that worry you,
charlotte knowing about this?
I'm not an addict!

457
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:08,045
Why are you so angry?

458
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,480
I don't know.

459
00:21:09,514 --> 00:21:11,415
Well, maybe we can
keep talking,

460
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:13,984
Find out
if there's something there.
I'm a good doctor.

461
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:16,787
Which is why you should also
stop seeing patients

462
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:20,157
Until we get a handle on this,
whatever it is.
And how do I explain that,

463
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,560
To charlotte,
to the doctors who refer me,

464
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:24,962
The patients
I already have scheduled?

465
00:21:24,996 --> 00:21:28,599
It will be easier than trying
to explain what happened

466
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:31,435
If you hurt someone.

467
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:37,074
I can help you
if you want me to.

468
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,248
Okay.

469
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:48,018
Hey.

470
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:49,220
Hey.

471
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:52,089
I called you last night.
Oh, sorry.

472
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:55,192
No, no, no, I just was worried
about you after you walked out.

473
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:57,761
I'm okay.
Okay.

474
00:21:57,796 --> 00:22:01,198
Well, for what it's worth,
I agree with you.

475
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:03,300
Enough is enough.

476
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:05,803
yeah.

477
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:07,938
Addison--
no. No, no.

478
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:10,874
What?
not in my office.

479
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:14,778
I was just trying
to be a friend.
Well, just, you know,
be a friend from there.

480
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:16,347
Will this help?

481
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:21,285
Hey, sam,
you got a minute?

482
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,787
I wanted to talk to you
about the wedding.

483
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:26,357
Uh, talk to violet.
No, no,
it's not a violet thing.

484
00:22:26,391 --> 00:22:28,325
Not now.
No, now, sam.

485
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,262
Look, I-I get that this
is hard for you, okay?

486
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:33,163
But it doesn't change the fact

487
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:35,332
That maya's
gonna get married tomorrow,

488
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,801
And you signed the paper
so that she could,

489
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:40,771
And now you're making her
feel like crap about it.
I will be there at the wedding.
I will walk her down the aisle.

490
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:42,973
Okay, but showing up
and acting like this?

491
00:22:43,008 --> 00:22:45,109
I mean, it's no better
than what naomi's doing.

492
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:47,278
And someone has to be there
for her, to be happy for her,

493
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:51,015
To--to support her, and if
it's not either of--
I'm trying.

494
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:53,083
try harder.

495
00:22:56,855 --> 00:22:58,856
Oh, hey.
Where you going?

496
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,892
I am going to pick up
maya and dink's wedding rings.

497
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:03,861
It's just another thing
that I can check off

498
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:07,665
This list of errands I never
thought I would do for anybody.

499
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:09,066
Hey, uh, before you go...

500
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,368
So should I be worried
about scott or...

501
00:23:11,403 --> 00:23:14,772
If I thought he was dangerous,
I would report him.

502
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:17,007
That's all I'm gonna say.

503
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:21,211
What?

504
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:22,813
Were you talking about me?

505
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:24,715
No.
No.

506
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:26,417
You were talking about scott.

507
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:28,752
Look, I am not gonna say
anything to either one of you.
And you shouldn't.

508
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:31,055
Unless of course you care
about the health and safety

509
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:33,424
Of any of the patients
he might treat at the hospital

510
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:36,660
Where he works,
cutting them open.
Which, roughly translated, means
"please, violate privilege

511
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:39,963
To give me some dirt
on my ex's new man."
I-I don't care
about you and him.

512
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:41,632
I do care that he's

513
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,801
Probably smart enough not to
trigger violet's duty to report,

514
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:46,136
Which means he's gonna
have to hurt someone

515
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:49,640
Before anyone
takes action here.
I'm--I'm not getting
in the middle of this.

516
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,443
you know who needs
therapy here? You.

517
00:23:52,477 --> 00:23:54,878
Cooper freedman.

518
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:56,847
Yeah, ike holden
is my patient.

519
00:23:56,881 --> 00:23:58,982
What happened?

520
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:01,985
And who's doing
the surgery?

521
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,961
Sam.

522
00:24:13,965 --> 00:24:15,632
How's maya doing?

523
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:18,102
How do you think
she's doing?

524
00:24:18,136 --> 00:24:19,803
She's getting married
tomorrow,

525
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:22,139
And you're
not gonna be there.

526
00:24:22,173 --> 00:24:24,541
Where are you gonna be?

527
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,443
I'm going to...

528
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:29,012
I'm going to napa...

529
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:30,814
With william.

530
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:33,384
Wow.
I don't expect you
to understand--

531
00:24:33,418 --> 00:24:34,852
Of course I understand.

532
00:24:34,886 --> 00:24:37,388
You think I don't want
to do the same thing,

533
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:40,057
Just run away
from all this?

534
00:24:40,091 --> 00:24:43,594
But I can't, because someone
has to be the adult here.

535
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:45,429
And you left that to me.

536
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:47,998
I didn't mean for this
to be like this, sam.
Just like
you're not gonna mean

537
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:50,701
For maya to start going
to corinne with her problems

538
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:52,136
Or for corinne to be

539
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,505
The one she wants around
when the baby comes,

540
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:57,474
And then in a little while
for corinne to be the one

541
00:24:57,509 --> 00:24:59,576
She starts seeing
as her family.

542
00:24:59,611 --> 00:25:02,379
Because if you keep doing
what you're doing,

543
00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:04,314
That's what's gonna happen.

544
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:07,951
So grow up. Do your job.
Be a mother.

545
00:25:14,692 --> 00:25:16,927
Now what?

546
00:25:16,961 --> 00:25:18,962
tell me you are not
doing this surgery.

547
00:25:18,996 --> 00:25:20,564
Ike has significant ischemia.

548
00:25:20,598 --> 00:25:22,599
If I don't restore
the blood supply, he could die.

549
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:25,001
Now I don't know what he's
told you, but this happens

550
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:26,770
In a small percentage
of hernia repairs.

551
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:29,806
I didn't do anything wrong.
You don't have to explain
the medicine to me.

552
00:25:29,874 --> 00:25:32,909
Just tell me if you've
taken anything today.
You're kidding.

553
00:25:32,944 --> 00:25:36,513
You do realize
your ex-boyfriend has issues?
Tell me there's nothing
in your system.

554
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:38,482
No oxy, nothing.

555
00:25:38,516 --> 00:25:41,685
I don't have time to play games
while a kid's on the table.

556
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:42,919
Stop.

557
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:45,689
Dr. Barker, I said stop.

558
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:49,993
I talked to dr. Graham
at county,

559
00:25:50,027 --> 00:25:52,429
Who said he'd take over.
Do you think he's good?

560
00:25:54,665 --> 00:25:56,733
I trust
dr. Montgomery's judgment.

561
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,837
He's good.

562
00:26:00,872 --> 00:26:02,172
Graham's good.

563
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:05,709
Hey.

564
00:26:05,743 --> 00:26:08,512
Hi.

565
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:14,084
Everything we wanted for him,

566
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:16,720
All the silly dreams
we used to talk about...

567
00:26:16,754 --> 00:26:20,190
We were gonna expose him
to great books and art.

568
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:25,495
And he was gonna grow up
to be so cultured.

569
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,065
And one day people like us
were gonna teach kids about him.

570
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,406
I know that's gone now.

571
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,511
But that's not what matters.

572
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:44,447
What matters is...
He's ours.

573
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:46,883
And I just want him
to understand

574
00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:50,187
That we're still here for him
and that we love him.

575
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:52,322
A child can feel
his mother's love.

576
00:26:52,356 --> 00:26:54,257
He knows you love him.

577
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:55,692
No, he doesn't.

578
00:26:55,726 --> 00:26:58,595
He can't, because I've
never even touched him.

579
00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:01,498
Well, there is a way...

580
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:04,201
For you to hold him.
Don't say that.

581
00:27:04,235 --> 00:27:06,102
Shira, I wouldn't, ever,

582
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:08,839
If I thought
there was any hope.

583
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:11,608
But at some point, you have to
know when to let go.

584
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:16,580
Could you?

585
00:27:18,883 --> 00:27:20,684
Um...

586
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:24,187
I'd hope
that I had the strength

587
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:26,957
To do what my child needed,

588
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:29,192
No matter
what the cost to me.

589
00:27:40,638 --> 00:27:42,372
We should.

590
00:27:42,406 --> 00:27:44,441
No. No.

591
00:27:44,475 --> 00:27:47,611
There's a chance.
Look, I'm not letting go.

592
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:49,446
There's a chance.

593
00:27:59,223 --> 00:28:02,158
Look at you. Fillmore's not
gonna know what hit him.

594
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,966
I--I'm gonna leave you to have
some time alone with your dad.

595
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:11,868
Check on the groom,

596
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:14,938
Make sure he brushes his hair
and knows how to tie that tie.

597
00:28:14,972 --> 00:28:17,073
I'll see you at the church.

598
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:19,109
It's going
to be wonderful, maya.

599
00:28:19,143 --> 00:28:21,077
I promise.

600
00:28:24,148 --> 00:28:25,315
Whew.

601
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:27,651
I know this isn't
what you wanted,

602
00:28:27,685 --> 00:28:29,686
But... Please...

603
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,288
Be happy for me.

604
00:28:31,322 --> 00:28:33,790
I am. I am.

605
00:28:33,824 --> 00:28:35,292
Honestly?

606
00:28:35,326 --> 00:28:37,961
Honestly, I'm--
I'm a little worried.

607
00:28:37,995 --> 00:28:40,797
But if this is
what you want--
I do.

608
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:43,934
Okay, well, then you need
to know that I love you,

609
00:28:43,968 --> 00:28:45,602
I will always be here,

610
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:48,605
And that I'm gonna help you
make sure that ultimately,

611
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:51,174
This is gonna be wonderful.

612
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,542
Okay?

613
00:28:53,778 --> 00:28:55,979
Ay?

614
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:02,886
Hey.

615
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,621
How's scott?

616
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,623
Trying to get better.

617
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:09,292
Checked himself in
somewhere last night.

618
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:11,094
I hope he does. I do.

619
00:29:11,162 --> 00:29:13,797
You want to say
I told you so.

620
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:16,166
But I won't.

621
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,168
Life's hard.
You shouldn't judge.

622
00:29:18,202 --> 00:29:20,804
Everybody needs
some kind of a crutch.

623
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,811
So I don't wind up

624
00:29:27,845 --> 00:29:31,348
Sitting next to a 15-year-old
texting the whole time,

625
00:29:31,382 --> 00:29:32,983
Would you mind if I...

626
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:35,719
Don't be an ass, cooper.
Make room for the girl.

627
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:37,654
Hi, I'm jordana sampson.

628
00:29:39,557 --> 00:29:41,091
Here.

629
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,674
I can't.

630
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:03,880
Sometimes when you
want something so badly...

631
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:08,051
And you get it...

632
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:11,187
Even if it's only
for a minute...

633
00:30:11,222 --> 00:30:13,623
You don't want to let go.

634
00:30:13,657 --> 00:30:15,325
I understand that.

635
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,793
It could change.

636
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:18,495
I mean, he could...

637
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:20,263
He could get better.

638
00:30:20,297 --> 00:30:21,998
You're hurting him,

639
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:23,900
And your job as a parent

640
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:26,836
Is to make sure
that nothing hurts him.

641
00:30:35,646 --> 00:30:38,014
I love him.

642
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:41,351
Then let him go.

643
00:30:45,523 --> 00:30:47,824
I thought...

644
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,327
I can't believe
mommy's really not coming.

645
00:30:51,362 --> 00:30:52,796
I thought she'd be here.

646
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,564
I know.

647
00:30:54,598 --> 00:30:56,266
I hoped she would.

648
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,670
Okay.

649
00:31:00,704 --> 00:31:02,672
I think it's time to go.

650
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:05,141
Yeah.

651
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:14,484
Mom.

652
00:31:30,134 --> 00:31:32,268
My mother gave this to me

653
00:31:32,303 --> 00:31:35,271
On the day
that I married your dad.

654
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:37,140
So...

655
00:31:37,174 --> 00:31:40,810
This is your, um,

656
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:43,980
Your something old...

657
00:31:44,014 --> 00:31:46,850
Borrowed and blue.

658
00:31:46,884 --> 00:31:48,818
Thank you.

659
00:31:50,588 --> 00:31:53,990
And for
your something new...

660
00:31:54,024 --> 00:31:56,593
I bought it
for your 16th birthday.

661
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:59,496
I always wanted one
when I was a girl, so...

662
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,832
"m.B." maya bennett.

663
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:04,968
I hope
you'll keep the name...

664
00:32:05,002 --> 00:32:08,471
and remember
where you came from.

665
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:13,343
Okay.

666
00:32:13,377 --> 00:32:15,912
Now you're ready.

667
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:59,129
Tell me
she didn't destroy her life.

668
00:32:59,163 --> 00:33:01,164
Tell me I didn't.

669
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:04,668
oh, nai. Look at her.

670
00:33:04,702 --> 00:33:07,904
maya may be
a lot of things right now,

671
00:33:07,939 --> 00:33:10,774
But... She is not destroyed.

672
00:33:56,854 --> 00:33:59,789
Have each of you chosen
to come here today

673
00:33:59,824 --> 00:34:02,692
And declare before god
and his church

674
00:34:02,727 --> 00:34:05,762
Your decision to
become husband and wife?

675
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:07,530
I have.

676
00:34:07,565 --> 00:34:08,898
I have.

677
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:12,936
And who give this woman
to be wedded to this man?

678
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,308
Her mother and I do.

679
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:49,032
Hey.
Than

680
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,767
It was what you deserve.

681
00:35:53,771 --> 00:35:57,607
Uh... You, uh,
you save me a dance, okay?

682
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,228
I was not waiting
in that line at sam's.

683
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:21,464
And addison has much nicer
skin care products.

684
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:23,366
Your little friend spilled
bruschetta on my dress.

685
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:25,568
Oh, I'm sure
she didn't mean to.
Of course she did.

686
00:36:25,603 --> 00:36:28,104
Yeah, you're probably right.
Why'd you bring her?

687
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:30,607
Why do you care? I mean,
apart from the tomatoes.

688
00:36:30,641 --> 00:36:33,209
If you'll excuse me,
I have to take this dress off

689
00:36:33,244 --> 00:36:34,677
And clean it.

690
00:36:34,712 --> 00:36:36,246
Mm.

691
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,426
Uh, first off, I'd like to thank
everybody for coming.

692
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,829
I know I speak for naomi
and corinne

693
00:36:52,863 --> 00:36:54,731
And maya and dink

694
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:58,468
When I say that we feel
so very blessed

695
00:36:58,502 --> 00:37:02,172
That you all came and shared
this special event with us.

696
00:37:02,206 --> 00:37:05,542
Seeing maya
in this wedding dress,

697
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:09,946
I'm struck by what a beautiful
and elegant young woman

698
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:12,482
She has grown up to become.

699
00:37:12,516 --> 00:37:15,151
And I know
that moving forward,

700
00:37:15,186 --> 00:37:17,987
This image of her
will stay with me,

701
00:37:18,022 --> 00:37:20,690
The same
as another image of maya

702
00:37:20,724 --> 00:37:22,926
In a different
pretty white dress

703
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,794
Has stayed with me as well.

704
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:27,497
The dress I'm talking about
was white,

705
00:37:27,531 --> 00:37:32,535
But it had red and blue
aball across the front.

706
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,438
I, uh, I remember,

707
00:37:35,473 --> 00:37:37,273
I came home one evening

708
00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:40,276
After a-a marathon
of kids' parties and whatnot,

709
00:37:40,311 --> 00:37:42,779
And little miss maya
was not quite ready

710
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:45,682
To take her little dress off
and get in the bath.

711
00:37:45,716 --> 00:37:48,551
So we went to her room
and hung out on her floor,

712
00:37:48,586 --> 00:37:50,053
Started talking.

713
00:37:50,087 --> 00:37:53,456
And out of nowhere, she told me
that when she grew up,

714
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:55,258
She wanted to marry me.

715
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:57,560
So, uh, I said, "why?"

716
00:37:57,595 --> 00:37:59,462
I asked her, I said, "why me?"

717
00:37:59,497 --> 00:38:01,865
And she looked up at me,

718
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:03,733
And she said, "because, daddy,

719
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:07,136
You are my anyway friend."

720
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,408
Now at the time,
I didn't know what that meant.

721
00:38:12,443 --> 00:38:14,811
So maya had to explain to me

722
00:38:14,845 --> 00:38:17,347
That an anyway friend

723
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:19,215
Is the one person in your life

724
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,252
Who, no matter what
they say or do,

725
00:38:22,286 --> 00:38:25,054
No matter what they've
been through with you,

726
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:27,924
They love you anyway.

727
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:32,929
<i>So my sincerest hope
is that for maya, dink,</i>

728
00:38:32,963 --> 00:38:37,133
<i>And for dink, maya,
is that anyway friend.</i>

729
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:39,202
<i>Because no matter
how old you are</i>

730
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:41,371
<i>Or what your responsibilities,</i>

731
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:43,373
<i>If you have love...</i>

732
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:45,942
<i>Real, unconditional love...</i>

733
00:38:45,976 --> 00:38:47,977
<i>I think you can make it.</i>

734
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:51,614
So... To my anyway friend

735
00:38:51,649 --> 00:38:53,483
And her anyway friend.

736
00:38:53,517 --> 00:38:56,452
May you not only make it...

737
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:58,922
But enjoy it.

738
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:13,836
Thank you.

739
00:39:13,871 --> 00:39:15,038
Hungry?

740
00:39:15,072 --> 00:39:18,675
Oh. Well, I'm just seeing
how good everything is.

741
00:39:18,709 --> 00:39:20,543
It is my food...

742
00:39:20,578 --> 00:39:22,712
My flowers...

743
00:39:22,746 --> 00:39:25,415
The place... The music.

744
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:29,819
This is my wedding.

745
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:39,662
Hey.

746
00:39:41,932 --> 00:39:44,901
It was
a beautiful speech, sam.

747
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:49,505
Sam?

748
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,508
When you
slept with mark sloan...

749
00:39:52,543 --> 00:39:54,510
I didn't really
say anything.

750
00:39:54,545 --> 00:39:57,080
But pete...

751
00:39:57,114 --> 00:39:58,648
He's my friend.

752
00:40:00,184 --> 00:40:03,086
He's my friend, just like
naomi is your friend,

753
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,556
But... I guess that doesn't
really matter to you.

754
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,324
Sam--
please.

755
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:12,195
It's my daughter's wedding.
I'm trying to be happy.

756
00:40:12,229 --> 00:40:14,330
So I'm gonna
put this aside.

757
00:40:14,365 --> 00:40:16,265
But, um...

758
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,935
I don't want to see you.

759
00:40:22,606 --> 00:40:24,841
I'm gonna go dance
with my daughter now.

760
00:40:29,046 --> 00:40:32,415
may I have a dance
with my daughter?

761
00:41:19,396 --> 00:44:30,753
ABBI
