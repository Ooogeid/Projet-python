1
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,590
New bag?

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,770
Chloe,on sale.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,770
Chloe¡¯s never on sale, you lucky bitch.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,810
I love chloe and bottega veneta...and¡ª

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,610
hermes.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,200
Oh,hermes.I'lls hermes.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:22,780
Is that tender?

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
Everythi's tender.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,230
It's gone to my liver,hasn't it?

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,300
I don't know,but we knew that that was a possibility.

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,550
I'd like to readmit you to the hospital,run some tests.

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,650
I can't.I can't go to the hospital.

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,860
Lillie,i know that-- That this is scary,but-- 

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,630
I'm not scared.I have stage iv ovarian cancer.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,520
I've had two courses of chemo,

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,000
three biopsies,one hysterectomy.

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,180
I'm way beyond scared.

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,790
It's milo.I...Can't leave him.

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,340
Your cat?

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,830
Lil-Lillie,i know that you're attached,but...

21
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,630
He's my world.

22
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,120
I spent my life working to make my design studio a go.

23
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,840
And it did,and it was great,but...

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,920
I thought there'd be time for everything else,and there wasn't.

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,510
But i had milo.And now...

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,770
I can't leave him alone.

27
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,090
Well,um...okay.

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,170
I can find you a cat walker or a sitter or,

29
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,180
you know,a...Whatever.I--You...

30
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,800
You need to get back to the hospital.

31
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,130
I need to make sure that milo's okay.

32
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,920
I need t sfindomebody to look after him...

33
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,210
Somebody i can trust.

34
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,980
Dr.Bennett.

35
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,300
Our patients are already here.They're very excited to start treatment.

36
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,030
I'm sorry.Uh,do i know you?

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,970
Gabriel fife.

38
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,630
Dr.Fife,director of the g.R.P. Genetic research program.

39
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,340
 - Uh,where?
 - Here.

40
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,870
We don't have a g.R.P.

41
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,620
William hired me two weeks ago.You should keep up with your office e-Mails.

42
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,040
I didn't get an e-Mail because i'm the one who's in charge  hiring.

43
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,410
William thought we'd be good together,professionallypeaking.

44
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,790
I've designed a technique that improves the success rate for 

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,140
complex imantations in various high-Risk groups.

46
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,060
What techniques?What high-Risk groups?

47
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,410
Meet the donovans-- Curti and sally.

48
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,670
They're here for embryo implantation.

49
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,830
We want to have a dwarf baby.

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,420
And we're going to givet to them.

-=[Up By TeamDsP]=-

54
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,150
Dr. Fife's been a godsend.

55
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,130
We've wanted children for so long.

56
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,540
But a child like us.

57
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,780
Without selection,there's about a 50% chance they'll have a dwarf baby,

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,530
but with embryo selection and isolating the f.G.F.R.3 mutation,

59
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,170
it's guaranteed.

60
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,170
U guaranteed it?

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,120
I know it's odd to some people,

62
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,600
people who see this as a deformity or a disability.

63
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,430
But it's us.It's who we are.

64
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,930
So when dr.Fife told us about you...

65
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,350
We are so grateful you're gonna give us a baby,our baby.

66
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,250
Thank you.

67
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,270
I just need time to review.

68
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,300
Dr. Fife,may i speak with you outside,please?

69
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,140
I know we just met,but i think you need to be careful.

70
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,250
You don't exactly exude the confidence most people expect from their doctor.

71
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,760
 - Confidence?
 - Just trying to be helpful.

72
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,810
No harm done.Tell me what can i do to expedite this process?

73
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,720
Um,i just met you five minutes ago...

74
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,470
And i haven't agreed to do any of this.

75
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,810
I am uncomfortable with the idea of designer babies,

76
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,920
and frankly,you say you work here,but i believe that you are mistaken.

77
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,940
William white hired me to do exactly this.

78
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,230
This is his practice.

79
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,410
This is my practice.

80
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,860
Then you ought to read your e-Mails.

81
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,720
I'll schedule the implantation for tomorrow.Nice meeting you.

82
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,700
There was no e-Mail.

83
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,480
I don't think i can move.

84
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,910
I can't get off the table.

85
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,320
 - Barbara-- 
 - Please.

86
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,370
I'm tired.I want to stay here.

87
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,550
Tell dr.Turner i can't talk today.

88
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,300
No,you need to see her.That's how you're fighting your depression.

89
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,710
And you are fighting it.

90
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,610
You got here.

91
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,090
Jimmy had to drag me.

92
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,620
It doesn't matter.You got here.

93
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,850
You did your biofeedback.

94
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,600
I don't feel better.

95
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,780
Which is why it's important for you to go upstairs,

96
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,510
so the therapies can work in concert.

97
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,730
I know you're trying to help,and i know everyone's trying to help,

98
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,110
I just...I'm done.I want to die.

99
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,210
I don't know why you people won't just let me kill myself 

100
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,000
so i can stop feeling like this.

101
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,130
So i said to him,"you do smell,bad.

102
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,410
You said that to the patient?

103
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,330
Yeah,i'm saying what i think.It's freeing.

104
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,430
I'm telling them what i think.And you know what?

105
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,620
They like it.

106
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,890
Anybody want a cat?

107
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,340
A temporary-- Temporary cat.

108
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,630
Nice pussy.

109
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,850
Oh,don't be childish.I'm talking about the cat.

110
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,120
It's not mine.It's my patient's.

111
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,030
Well,just be careful.

112
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,400
Single woman,living alone-- 

113
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,040
First it's one cat,then you're staying home friday nights watching chick flicks.

114
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,980
Next thing you know,you're living with nine cats and a bird.

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,690
It's not mine.

116
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,770
Why is catwoman so sexy,but a woman with cats--  

117
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,900
So not.

118
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,160
I think you should keep the cat.

119
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,290
I think it's a perfect opportunity for someone with commitment issues to work through them.

120
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,120
I'm saying what i think.

121
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,140
It's freeing.

122
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,070
Violet,i am glad that you're feeling better.I am.

123
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,350
But,uh,i do not have commitment issues.

124
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,910
He charlotte.I bet,uh,you like cats.

125
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,770
I'm allergic.

126
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,400
I just wanted to give you ladies a little thanks for welcoming me to the practice gift.

127
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,530
I just got 'em.

128
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,580
Please.Not in front of the...

129
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,750
Cat.

130
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,720
Cat sitters,l.A.

131
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,820
Cats don't need a sitter.

132
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,530
Haven't you ever had a pet before?

133
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,190
Yeah,we had horses...

134
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,880
With trainers and riders.

135
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,630
Oh,and i had a pet hermit crab once.

136
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,230
But the air filter was very noisy,so i shut it off,and he died.

137
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,760
I'm escaping.

138
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,050
Escaping who?

139
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,580
My new director of genetic research.

140
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,640
Impressive.You guys are going high-Tech.

141
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,010
William is.He hired him...Behind my back.

142
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,290
Wait.Aren't you supposed to be in charge?

143
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,970
Yes,i am.

144
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,840
Is he good?

145
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,450
He's brilliant,and--And he's know it.

146
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,560
And he's arrogant and he's rude and...

147
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,300
He's in a wheelchair.

148
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,270
And his patients are little people.

149
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,160
And they want to do a selective implantation.They want a little baby.

150
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,540
I,uh,i guess that leaves you with a small problem.

151
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,530
Don't act like you weren't thinking it.

152
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,920
Well,you're in charge,nai.

153
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,110
Yes,i am.I am.

154
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,590
And genetic selection is a line that i won't cross.

155
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,670
There you have iyou just stand tall.

156
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,680
I gotta go find cooper.He'll laugh with me.

157
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,450
Why is there a cat in here?

158
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,530
So if the snot turns green,you're gonna have your mom call me,right?

159
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,050
Yes.All right,give me five.

160
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,320
Get outta here.

161
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,750
His fever spikes,call me,but otherwise,he's fine.

162
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,010
All right,bye.

163
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,650
Problem?

164
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,250
Addison or sam giving you a hard time?

165
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,600
You need me to beat somebody up-- An o.W.G.Smackdown?

166
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,950
No patients.

167
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,670
oh,well,they'll grow to like you.

168
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,630
You're an  an acquired taste.I did.

169
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,320
No patients,cooper.No people patients.

170
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,120
It's been two weeks,and my practice is bombing.

171
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,590
 - It's embarrassing.
 - Charlotte--

172
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,680
Cooper,you goata boload of little snotty-Head kids.

173
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,550
Go doctor 'em while i figure out what i'm doing wrong.

174
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,700
I watch her all the time.I...

175
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,780
I don't even keep a razor in my bathroom because...

176
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,190
I watch her,but she stopd eating.

177
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,810
Barbara's never getting better,is she?

178
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:06,010
Jimmy,depression is tough to break,and treatment is not fast.

179
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,610
Yeah,it's been over a year.

180
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,670
I mean,she nursed her father,we canceled the wedding...

181
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,300
I love her,pete.

182
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,680
I need her better.

183
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,810
Are you going up for your appointment?

184
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,740
No,i'm...I'm tired of all the talking.

185
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,330
I'm tired of all the pills.Um,it's not working.

186
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,300
 - Barbara-- 
 - Jimmy...

187
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,470
Barbara made decision.

188
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,450
What decision?

189
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,600
Dr.Turner has a way for me to get better,to feel happy again now.

190
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,450
I'm gonna do electric shock therapy.

191
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,230
This is not the treatment we agreed on.

192
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,540
Well,the treatment we agreed on isn't working.

193
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,370
She needs a shock to the system,literally.

194
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,510
 - What?
 - What are you doing?

195
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,000
My--My job.

196
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,500
I'm adapting to barba's situation.I'm altering course.

197
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,010
By sending electrical current through our patient's brain and inducing a seizure?

198
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,680
That's a last resort.

199
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,550
It's not cuckoo's nest.

200
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,930
There's no holding her down,frothing at the mouth.

201
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,560
She's not gonna feel a thing.

202
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,840
It is accepted treatment.She is desperate.

203
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,000
She wants to be better,she wants to be better now,

204
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,770
and i can give that to her.

205
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,190
E.C.T. Is not a magic bullet,and this is not like you.

206
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,920
Well,i'm not like me.You know,this is the new me.

207
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,750
Look,violet,i know the trial was rough on you.

208
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,560
You faced your attacker,and that was-- 

209
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,260
Freeing.I'm free.

210
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,460
I'm great.But this is not about me.

211
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,840
This is about barbara and what she needs.

212
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,750
Pete,we have tried everything.

213
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,800
We've tried antidepressants,acupressure,

214
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,070
biofeedback,exercise therapy,talk therapy.

215
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,060
Nothing's working.Slow and steady is not working.

216
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,300
Slow and steady takes time.You're the one that's always preaching that.

217
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,660
Well,maybe i was wrong.

218
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,930
People deserve more,faster.

219
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,780
I asked you to help,and you did.

220
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,940
And thank you.

221
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,520
And now if you don't mind,

222
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,880
i am taking my new vibrator and heading home.

223
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,100
I want you to press this button whenever you have discomfort,okay?

224
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,420
Lill.

225
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,950
Dr.Montgomery,this is dr.Reynolds.

226
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,070
I'm brian,her neoncologist.

227
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,050
Addison.******

228
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,720
Morphine,huh?

229
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,100
The pain's worse?

230
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,850
Well,hopefully aftethe chemo,it should start to subside.

231
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,040
I'm actually not recommending that.

232
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,620
But if we can give her a few more mons,then...

233
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,590
I know you're a surgeon and you like to fix things,

234
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,170
and lillie told me how good you are,

235
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,150
but i think it might be time to let go.

236
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,100
I think that's not your call.

237
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,160
No,it's mine.

238
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,560
I'm sorry,addison.

239
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,110
You did your best.I'm grateful.

240
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,230
But he's right.I've decided.

241
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,420
I think i was holding on to my life.

242
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,000
But once you agreed to take milo,there's noson to anymore.

243
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,870
It's time.

244
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,790
Before you yell...

245
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,870
I want to start with an apology.

246
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,920
I wanted to be here yesterday to introduce you to dr.Fife,but my jet was delayed.

247
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,030
We had a deal,william.

248
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,140
Hiring was my responsibility,and you went around me.

249
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,260
You knew that i would object to his research,

250
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,400
his attitude and ultimately,his hiring.

251
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,060
I was aware that you might object to some of his research,yes.

252
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,230
Okay,would object.But he became available.

253
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,480
There were other people interested.I had to make a decision.

254
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Think of the potential.

255
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,460
Sickle cell,hemophilia,cystic fibrosis--

256
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,450
His work has the ability to change the face of medicine as we know it.

257
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,480
That's what you and i wanted.

258
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,900
He has no moral center.

259
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,730
He supports eugenics.

260
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,050
He wants me to help him design a baby.

261
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,310
That's what you do,naomi,when you weed out for disease.

262
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,670
You're afraid of the slippery slope,but you're already on it.

263
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,340
Maybe,but i am not skiing down it.

264
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,250
I'm not asking you to accept him.I'lling you...

265
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,270
Find a way to make it work.

266
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,370
so there'll be a sedative running in the i.V.

267
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,870
And once i hit the switch,

268
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,970
the current will move from the left cortex to the right cortex,

269
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,570
inducing a seizure,which we will monitor on the e.E.G.

270
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,890
How long wil take?

271
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,640
It'll be over in a few seconds.

272
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,230
And you're not gonna feela thing.

273
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,240
A few days of observation,i'll send you home a new woman-- 

274
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,060
A happier one anyway.You ready?

275
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,300
I love you.

276
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,450
Is that it?

277
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,840
That's it.

278
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,190
Well...

279
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,970
It looks like i'm gonna have a cat for longer than i thought.

280
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,490
Your patient...

281
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,500
Chose hospice.

282
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:24,440
She's refusing treatment and she...Is gonna die.

283
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,140
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,000
she's dying alone.

285
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,180
Do you have any chocolate?We're all out downstairs.

286
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,120
Yes,sam.I ate it all.

287
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,450
Do you have any chocolate,please?

288
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,180
That's from halloween.

289
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,190
Didn't go well?

290
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,970
Apparently i have the ability to he whoever i want.

291
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,780
So does he.

292
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,650
Doesn't mean you have to do what fife's asking you to do.

293
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,660
It's still your practice.

294
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,800
Yeah,if he's being such a jerk,why don't you just tell him off?

295
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,030
I can't.

296
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,480
He's in that chair.

297
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,460
What?I-I know it doesn't seem right,

298
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,680
but telling off a man who's...It feels wrong.Can't.

299
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,710
Then i think you should go to the little people.

300
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,920
No,i'm serious.

301
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,000
They're your patients now.Talk them out of it.

302
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,870
If you think it's wrong,then convince them.

303
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,770
You're right.

304
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,220
I'll convince 'em.

305
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,800
Go ahead.Take 'em.

306
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,900
Thank you.

307
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,990
Charlotte.

308
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,100
I understand you've joined oceanside wellness.

309
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,310
Good for you.

310
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,720
It is...Good for me.

311
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,160
It's allowed me to refocus my priorities on to patient care-- 

312
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,980
Someing my previous administrative duties prevented me from doing.

313
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,140
Well,it appears it all worked out for the best.

314
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,650
Yes,i've got patients lining up out the door.

315
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,960
Congratulations on all your success.

316
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,010
I was just keeping jimmy company while he waits for her to wake up.

317
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,250
He's getting coffee.

318
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,100
She's fine.It went off without a hitch.

319
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,570
Good.That's good.

320
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,750
Hey,barbara.You're in the hospital.Everything went well.

321
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,330
How are you feeling?

322
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,220
Oh,i have a headache.

323
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,240
But there's nothing pressing down on my shoulders anymore.

324
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,350
I f-- I feel...

325
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,540
Lighter.

326
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,700
Look at you.

327
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,580
Look at that smile.

328
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,160
I missed that smile.

329
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,380
Barb?

330
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,840
I'm sorry.Uh,do i know you?

331
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,260
Mild,temporary memory loss is a common side effect of e.C.T. 

332
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,150
Mild?She doesn't remember me.

333
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,060
She looked right through me.

334
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,230
The memory loss should resolve in time.

335
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,390
And until then,what do i do?

336
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,990
Do i remind her of things or do i have to keep my distance?

337
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,530
Look,i-I know this is scary,jimmy.

338
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,210
But don't expect her to react to you the way she has in the past.

339
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,700
But you can talk to her,jog her memory.

340
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,170
That may help.

341
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,000
Okay,violet.

342
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,410
Cards on the table-- How bad is this?

343
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,620
I don't know.

344
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,570
I don't know,pete.

345
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,820
I mean,it's rare,but sometimes the memory loss is permanent.

346
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,600
But she seemed good-- He attitude.

347
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,220
I mean,that's a good sign,isn't it?

348
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,830
It is not a good sign.

349
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,570
That's his fianc,and you're saying she might never remember him?

350
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,640
She's happy.That's good for her.But what about him?

351
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,050
I told you not to rush into this.

352
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,610
I will fix this,okay?

353
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,200
I will.

354
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,760
Once we start down the road of choosing characteristics for our children,

355
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,390
i don't--I don't know where that ends.

356
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,260
It's not something that our practice does.

357
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:12,010
I do want to work with you.I do.But,um...

358
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,200
Your daughter?

359
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,590
She's very pretty.She looks just like you.

360
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,890
Thank you.

361
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,740
You know,i-I-I nevereally see the resemblance,but,uh-- 

362
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,250
Of course you don't.

363
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,130
You take it for granted--Having a child that looks like you.

364
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,550
But what if someone had told you you couldn't have your daughter,

365
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,100
your own daughter,who's like you in so many ways?

366
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,350
Even if you don't select for dwarfism,

367
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,560
yourhild will be a part of you.

368
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,750
What do you see when you look at me?

369
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,000
I...

370
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,520
It's a hard question for tall person to answer...

371
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,760
Because all you see is the dwarf.

372
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,340
No.No,i don't.

373
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:54,710
When i look at curtis,i see an accountant,a husband,

374
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,360
and those things are what our friends see.

375
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,320
If we have a child who's 5'10",

376
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,930
they'll look at him the way other people look at us.

377
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,430
What if you had a 50/50 chance of having a white baby?

378
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,410
Would you want a white baby?

379
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,940
N--It's not the same thing.

380
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,030
It is.

381
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,510
You'd lo that white baby,

382
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,750
but every day,people would question whether she was yours.

383
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,550
They'd whisper like they'll whisper about our tall child.

384
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,220
Would you want thatfor your child?

385
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,050
We're not asking you to clone us.

386
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,830
We're just asking for what any other parent would come in and ask for.

387
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,360
We want what you have.

388
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,650
How is that crossing a line?

389
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,550
You going to stand there all day or do you have something to say?

390
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,380
In the wrong hands,genetic engineering can have terrible consequences.

391
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,850
So while you are here,i'm gonna be the gatekeeper.

392
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,400
That means i set the limits.

393
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,070
If there's gonna be any slippery slope,

394
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,430
i'm gonna be the one to decide just how far we slide.

395
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,500
So you're in with the donovans?

396
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,500
Yes.

397
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,550
Well...Don't expect me tohank you for doing what's right.

398
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,170
He is just...He's a little man.

399
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,450
I'm sorry.Wheelchair or no,he is a little man.

400
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,330
What...

401
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,050
Whats this?

402
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,160
It's a christmas angel.

403
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,830
You can take your kitty caroling.

404
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,200
We're outta here.

405
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,130
Um,th--  This isn't her cat.

406
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,510
This is,uh,for a temporary cat she's taking care of.

407
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,370
So no caroling.

408
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,750
But thank you.

409
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,710
Okay,this place is insane,all right?

410
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,950
We are in retail purgatory.

411
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,110
All because i'm trying to do a good deed for my patient?

412
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,590
Let's...Let's go over here.This--This looks safe.

413
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,940
Oh,cute bag.

414
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,330
That's a cat carrier.

415
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,290
Really?

416
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,440
What,you think milo would like it?

417
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,180
I think lillie would like it.

418
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,920
Charlotte?

419
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,680
oh,what are you doing?

420
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,770
Pipes weren't right.Need to redo 'em.

421
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,600
Charlotte...

422
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Damn it.

423
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,570
Cheap tools.

424
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,500
How can i work like this?

425
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,770
What do you want,cooper?

426
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,320
You want me to say i screwed up?

427
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,160
Okay,I screwed up.

428
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,780
You didn't want me to do this,and william white thinks-- 

429
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,270
Doesn't know you.

430
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,790
You are not heartless.

431
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,760
I saw him...

432
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,880
In the elevator.

433
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,170
I humiliated myself.

434
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,040
I stood there...

435
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,500
And i lied to him,

436
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,980
told him everything was great and that i was great.

437
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,960
And he knew i was lying.

438
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,780
He doesn't matter.

439
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,500
William white doesn't matter.

440
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,390
I can't fail twice.

441
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,270
I don't have it in me.

442
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,100
I can taste things again.

443
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,180
And when i look outside,the sky is blue...

444
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,250
Like indigo or cobalt or...Sapphire maybe.

445
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,930
I'm sorry.It's just,um,everything feels so...

446
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,610
New.

447
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,360
That's great.That's--That's exactly how it's supposed to be.

448
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,870
Um,from the work we've done so far,

449
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,790
i can see that your ability to form new meries is intact,

450
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,640
so i'm gonna ask you some other questions,okay?

451
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,890
Uh,what's the name of your high school?

452
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,460
Monklands high.

453
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,300
Prom date?

454
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,190
Eddie parker.

455
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,390
Great prom.Romance in venice.

456
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,330
That--That's impressive.

457
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,330
I didn't think anyone remembered their prom theme.

458
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,640
It was great.

459
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,550
We did it by this pool with these giant papier-MGondolas.

460
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,280
I think i remember because...

461
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,910
My dad told me so many stories about venice.

462
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,490
He went there with my mom on their honeymoon.

463
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,160
Can you tell me about his illness?

464
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,510
He--He was just sickfor such a long time.

465
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,500
And he tried to hang on until...

466
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,370
Until the wedding?

467
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,670
What?

468
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,090
What wedding?

469
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,030
To jimmy.

470
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,420
You and jimmy were going to get married.

471
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,550
I don't know.

472
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,900
I'm sorry.He--He seems like a really nice guy.

473
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,780
I-Really wish i could remember.

474
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,740
She remembers  nothing about jimmy.

475
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,310
She remembers everything else--Everything.

476
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,830
Memory loss from e.C.T.Is not that specific.

477
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,950
Then what is it?

478
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,320
I think the e.C.T. Worked.I think it unblocked her.

479
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,490
I think we got to the root of her depression.

480
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,980
I think the problem is jimmy.

481
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,410
Something happened with jimmy,

482
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,900
something so bad that she blocked it out.

483
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,130
Good morning,nai.

484
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,740
Oh,i hear you hired a new doctor.

485
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,990
Whatever.

486
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,130
I'm sorry.No,yes.A-A doctor has been hired.

487
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,310
And he's great,and everything's going  be great.

488
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,200
If you could erase bad memories,do you think everything in your life would better?

489
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,840
There's some things in my life i'd like to erase.

490
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,170
Yeah,wouldn't we all?

491
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,890
Say the thing.

492
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,500
Violet is not ready to come back.

493
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,000
Do not get your hopes up.Do not push.

494
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,720
Wait.

495
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,520
But she's better.She's freed or something.

496
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,850
Do--Do you want me to say the thing again?

497
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,430
Violet is not ready to come back.

498
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,110
Do not get your hopes up.Do not push.

499
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,980
Wait.

500
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,970
Okay,thanks.

501
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,790
Anytime.

502
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,480
White may have hired you,but you work for me,

503
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,180
and as long as you d you will not withhold information from me.

504
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,380
Exactly what's the problem?

505
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,580
The embryos that have the marker for dwarfism-- 

506
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,160
They have a mutation that the other embryos don't have.

507
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,050
It's called v.H.L.

508
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,900
I know what it's called,

509
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,630
and children born with it have a 40% chance of developing cancer by the time 

510
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
that they' in their 20s.

511
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,590
It's a nonissue.

512
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,570
It's cancer.

513
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,310
And in 20 years,if these children develop it,

514
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,110
my gene therapy treatments will allow me to cure it.

515
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,880
No one can guarantee that.

516
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,040
I can.I did.

517
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:58,980
What do you mean,you did?

518
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,850
I told the donovans.They want to go aheadwith the implantation.

519
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,750
They'd rather have a sick,dwarf child than a tall,healthy one?

520
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,590
The non-Dwarf embryos don't have the mutation.

521
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,150
I told you,it's a nonissue.

522
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,850
Oh,you--I have been walking around here trying to be polite to you,

523
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,370
but that is it.I am done.

524
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,120
You are the most egotistical,pushy,

525
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,170
boorish little man that i have ever met.

526
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,520
Good for you.

527
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,300
Excuse me?

528
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,250
You got over your fear of the wheelchair.

529
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,920
That usually takes peoplea few months,but you?

530
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,600
Less than a week.I'm impressed.

531
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,600
Now if you can just get over your fear of little people--  

532
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,600
Shut up!

533
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,650
Shut up,you stupid,horrible,stupid...

534
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,430
Jerk!

535
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,690
Okay,that was kinda lame.

536
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,230
We're still doing the implantation.

537
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,600
No!No,we are not.

538
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,830
Okay,we're gonna try something different.

539
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,800
Um,hey,jimmy,describe the last fight you had with barbara.

540
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,400
Our last fight?We don't fight.

541
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,050
Well,come on.All couples fight.

542
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,990
It doesn't have to be a big thing.

543
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,520
It can be small even.

544
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,920
You were always so sad.I-I didn't want to upsetou anymore.

545
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,410
Well,how--How about you,barbara?

546
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,000
I-I don't want you to think about jimmy,

547
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,000
but justescre the last fight you had with anyone.

548
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,900
Um,i don't know.

549
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
Well,like violet said,everyone fights.

550
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,290
It's not that.It's just...

551
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,500
I'm sorry.

552
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,160
I know you want me to remember,and i want to remember...

553
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,820
Good things.

554
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:28,030
But to start talking about fights?I...

555
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,770
I've discovered peaches and the smell of lavender.

556
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,640
And i'm just...I'm so happy.

557
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,040
I don't want to go back.

558
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,140
Barbara...Please.

559
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,810
You have to try.

560
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,680
We were in love.You loved me.

561
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,930
I'm sorry.You seem so nice.

562
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,930
But...

563
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,850
Can i have some more jell-O?

564
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,950
So how did you hear about me?

565
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,090
Uh,well,i-I saw you at a seminar.

566
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,700
Great.There's really no need to be nervous,mr.Parker.

567
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,420
Whatever issueavou he,we can talk about it openly.

568
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,180
It's the only way i'm gonna be able to help.So...

569
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,740
How can i help?

570
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,590
I love my girlfriend.And i want her to be happy...

571
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,880
Satisfied.

572
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,720
I understand.

573
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,250
But i'm just a little too quick on,um...

574
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,440
Pulling the trigger?

575
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,130
Well,that's a common problem.

576
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,910
There are many possible explanations and treatments.

577
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,490
We will get to the bottom of this.

578
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,040
And i can guarantee you,you and your girlfriend will be satisfied.

579
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,610
Great.That--That's great.

580
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,800
That--That's why i went online in the first place.

581
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,900
But the more i read,the more freak out i got,

582
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,400
then someone in the ch room suggested you,and,um-- 

583
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,320
I thought you said you saw me at a seminar.

584
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,380
Right.After the seminar,i went to a chat room.

585
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,540
I wasn't supposed to mention the chat room.

586
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,030
Exactly what chat room are we talking about?

587
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,410
Uh,we don't allow animals in here.

588
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,880
I'm kidding.

589
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,230
I'm impressed.

590
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,450
With this?

591
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,120
It is pretty fabulous,isn't it?

592
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,580
No,that you'd bring a cat for a visit.

593
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,990
It's very nice of you.

594
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,660
Maybe you're a cat person after all.

595
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:23,430
I know you think you're paying me a compliment,but i don't think so.

596
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,390
No?

597
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,110
Oh,actually i was hoping it would flatter you enough that you'd have coffee with me.

598
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:33,030
You're asking me out on a date as we walk to our terminally ill patient's room?

599
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,190
I'm an oncologist.I'm always walking to a terminally ill patient's room.

600
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,090
I ask where i can,when i can or i'd never get to ask.

601
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,800
Yes,to coffee.

602
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:46,930
Ah,you know what?Can you just hold this for a minute?

603
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,930
Sure.

604
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,350
Hey,milo.

605
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,850
Hello,milo.

606
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,030
There we go.

607
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,410
How's his hair?

608
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,480
Perfect.

609
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,520
Okay,bud.

610
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,310
I'm sorry.

611
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,090
She's afraid.

612
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,440
Of course she's afraid.She's feeling good.

613
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,360
She's feeling better.She doesn't want to lose that.

614
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,410
So how do we break through?

615
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,300
We don't.

616
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,580
That's it?

617
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,920
She's blocked out jimmy,you think there's a big mystery about him,

618
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,290
and we just give her jell-O?

619
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,590
She found a magic bullet,pete.

620
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,680
And what about jimmy?

621
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,910
If you're right about him,he could be dangerous.

622
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,600
If not,then is it fair that he suddenly becomes nobody to her?

623
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,470
I wish i could forget.I wish i could...

624
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,920
Find everything bad that happened to me and yank it out.

625
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,290
I canN't.She can.

626
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,350
I'm not gonna take that away from her.

627
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,380
You're the one that pushed her to get the e.C.T.Violet,

628
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,200
and now she's damaged.

629
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,700
 - She's better.
 - I don't buy that.

630
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,810
And if you're not gonna get to the truth,i will.

631
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,390
Pete,d-- 

632
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,090
Barbara...We need to talk about jimmy.

633
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,710
Is something wrong?

634
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,400
Pete,let her rest.

635
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,730
What's wrong is your memory.

636
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,490
Now i know you've been through a lot and you're feeling better,

637
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,900
 - but e.C.T. does not-- 
 - Pete-- 

638
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,280
E.C.T. does not completely erase one person from your memory 

639
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,340
and leave everything else intact.

640
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,360
That's not the way it works.

641
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,800
Th-Then...I don't understand.

642
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,480
If you're blocking jimmy out,there might be a reason-- 

643
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,770
A real reason,not an e.C.T.Reason-- Something he did.

644
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,280
Something that--That-- That you're burying.

645
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,580
Something that--That you've buried so deeply 

646
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,700
during the past year that it might be hard to talk about.

647
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,780
If jimmy did something to you,

648
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,470
if you're scared,we can help protect you.

649
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,520
You can tell us,and no matter how bad it is,

650
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,420
no matter how awful,we'll make sure he never hurts you again.

651
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,200
I'm sorry.

652
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,300
Was there something funny about that?

653
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,870
No,the idea that jimmy is dangerous.

654
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,280
You know him.He's...

655
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,440
What?

656
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,810
Nice.

657
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,680
You remember jimmy.

658
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,480
I-I woke up feeling better.

659
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,270
I smiled,and then i saw jimmy walk through that door,

660
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,330
and i didn't want to smile anymore.

661
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,430
I couldn't just tell him to go away after everything he's done.

662
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,610
But i remember you telling me that e.C.T.Can cause memory loss,

663
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,340
so i suddenly realized,i could forget him.

664
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,120
And then i wouldn't have to hurt his feelings.

665
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,070
Wouldn't it have been easier to just tell him 

666
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,270
you're-- You're engaged to him.

667
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:22,350
And for the life of me,i-I can't figure out why.

668
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,470
When i was depressed,he--He seemed fine.

669
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,610
And he took care of me,and i really appreciated that.

670
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:31,620
Buafter the e.C.T.,it's like the lights in my head went on,and...

671
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,050
What was i thinking?

672
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,270
No wonder i was depressed for such a long time.

673
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,930
Don't you think your father's death might have had something to do with that?

674
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,980
Yes,of course.

675
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,700
He liked jimmy so much.

676
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,740
He used to tell me all the time,

677
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,410
barbara,jimmy-- He's such a nice boy.

678
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,150
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

679
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,350
Sometimes,i--Ugh!I want him to hurt a fly.

680
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,730
You get it.

681
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,490
Jimmy's that guy-- 

682
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,950
That guy at the bar that you go home with at 3:00 a.M.

683
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,710
Because the guy you really want to go home with went home with somebody else.

684
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,740
Telling him-- It just seems cruel.

685
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,650
I want to spare him.

686
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,130
Isn't this better?

687
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,730
I just told off a man in a wheelchair,and it felt so good.

688
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,700
I may be going to hell,but i am taking him with me.

689
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,000
What's wrong?

690
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,750
Lillie died.

691
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,350
I'm sorry.

692
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,290
Alone,in a tiny room by herself without family,without friends...

693
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,410
Addison,you're not dying...

694
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,900
And you're not alone.

695
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,290
I know.I have you...

696
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,390
And sam...

697
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,020
And this practice.But...

698
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,700
God,i am alone.

699
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,500
And i don't know if it's me or if i have some bad karma because i'm a cheater,

700
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:03,350
but every man i meet,it's either the wrong person or the wrong time.

701
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,030
Even the oncologist-- Lillie's oncologist.

702
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,260
He asked me out.

703
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,710
Brian reynolds?

704
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,070
He's cute.

705
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,070
Yes.I said yes.

706
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,280
But i can't,nai.

707
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,760
I'm a mess.I'm too screwed up to date.

708
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,170
And this damn cat keeps staring at me.

709
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,750
What the hell were you thinking?

710
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,870
Hey,dr. King.I'm with a patient.

711
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,870
A real patient.

712
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,280
Not like that guy you sent me,the one with the...

713
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,680
You met him in a chat room.

714
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,560
My mom doesn't let me go into chat rooms.

715
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,950
Your mom's right,unless you're supervisedy a grown-Up.

716
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,750
I'm a grown-Up-- 

717
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,950
No,he isn't.

718
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,900
I was trying to help.

719
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,430
Don't.I don't need your pity patients.

720
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:54,300
Your hesitation has nothing to do with the second genetic lesion.

721
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,540
Let's call this what it is.

722
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,750
Yes,et's.

723
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,800
Uh,which is what?

724
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,650
You won't do the implantation because you think we're freaks.

725
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,600
You're prejudiced against little people.

726
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:05,520
There is nothing i would rather do than give you what you want,

727
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,120
but not like this.

728
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,000
But it's the only way for us.

729
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,580
I understand what you want-- 

730
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,330
Look at you.

731
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,970
How can you possibly understand what it's like to be laughed at,

732
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,110
to never fit in?

733
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,810
You're tall and beautiful and successful.

734
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,220
I was fat.

735
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,200
As a kid,i...I was fat.

736
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:27,750
I don't mean to suggest that it's comparable,but everyone has their own scs to bear.

737
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,400
We all have our insecurities,

738
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,950
and--And they're painful and-Nd persistent,and they're ours.

739
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,380
I don't want to compare painful anecdotes with you,

740
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,180
i'm just saying,is in some small way,i do understand.

741
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,910
A small way?

742
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,470
Oh,you know it is really hard to avoid using words like "big" 

743
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,380
and "small" and "short" and "tall.

744
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,490
We try to say things nicely,but you--

745
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,620
You know,the fact of the matter is,i wasn't just fat.

746
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,500
"Fat" is the nice word for what i was.

747
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,600
I was huge.I was massive.

748
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,610
Six summers of fat camp.

749
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,540
My whole adolescence being made fun of.

750
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,860
I have heard every single joke-- 

751
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:07,720
"Lard-O," and "fat ass" and,uh,"dumbo" and "elephant" and-- 

752
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:12,350
In our group of friends,a tall child will be "luh" or "giant" or "godzilla.

753
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,660
Bue'if hs healthy,he'll survive it.

754
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,700
I did.

755
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,000
You did.

756
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,560
But i cannot implant a sick embryo.

757
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,550
No matter what dr.Fife promises you about future breakthroughs,

758
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,950
I cannot do it.

759
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,760
But what i can do is help you to have a healthy baby.

760
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,820
And whether he is tall or--Or medium or small,

761
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,130
when you hold him in your arms,he will be yours.

762
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,700
And you'll love him.

763
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,730
Isn't that all that really matters?

764
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,120
That's what i can give you.

765
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,290
Are you dr. Montgomery?

766
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,970
The hospital told me i'd find you here.

767
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,350
I'm iris.Lillie's second cousin iris.

768
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:01,180
Oh,uh,yeah.Please...Come in.

769
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,870
I'm so sorry for your loss.

770
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,890
I didn't realize that lillie had any family.

771
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,040
We weren't close.

772
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,480
But lillie called me,

773
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:15,610
asked me to make the arrangements,wr up the loose ends.

774
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,630
Is there anythg that i can do or do you have any questions?

775
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,610
Lillie told me how kind you were.

776
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,220
She told me you offered to care for milo.

777
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,200
She wanted me to thank you.

778
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,030
I was glad i could help.

779
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,700
She didn't want to impose on you any further.

780
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,730
It wasn't her way.

781
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,250
I've come to take milo home with me.

782
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,750
 - Ex-Exactly what do you find so funny?
 - I'm sorry.

783
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:05,430
It's the fact that i dreamed up this huge trauma that turned out to be niceness.

784
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,450
The fact that somebody could dislike somebody else so much that

785
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,760
she'd pretend not to remember him...

786
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,710
It's not funny.

787
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,180
Oh,i wasn't,you know,i wasn't gonna tell you this,

788
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,980
but i actually-- I thought that...

789
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,040
I thought that jimmy might have killed her father.

790
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:24,500
Oh,it's sad,isn't it-- The lengths we go to...

791
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,310
People?

792
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
Sad for jimmy.

793
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,840
Oh,poor,nice jimmy.

794
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,380
We have to tell him.

795
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,220
This isn't right.

796
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,050
You want to break his heart more honestly?

797
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,450
'Cause either way,barbara doesn't want to be with him.

798
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,080
Is that how it is for u with me?

799
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,430
No,don't answer that.

800
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:48,070
Just don't say what you think,for once.I don't want to know.

801
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,550
Come on,pete.We're just...

802
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,000
We're laughing.

803
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,620
We're having fun.

804
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,550
So...We lie to jimmy.

805
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,700
We lie to jimmy.

806
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,650
You're a very persuasive woman...

807
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,280
But not a particularly far-Sighted doctor.

808
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,810
Science is about pgrs.

809
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,410
And ten years from now,these kind of choices will be commonplace,

810
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,050
with or without your approval.

811
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,730
There are limits to what we should do.

812
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,630
and i guess here,you get to decide.

813
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,150
You don't like me.

814
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,100
No,i don't.

815
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,680
I didn't like you either.

816
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,060
You're beautiful,gorgeous,really,

817
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,600
and very,very annoyingly tall.

818
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,300
But the fact that you were a big,giant fatty makes me like you just little bit now.

819
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,300
There are chinks in that armor.

820
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,970
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

821
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,110
Uh,actually,yes.

822
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,130
But don't feel too good about it.

823
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,850
You got what you wanted today.

824
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:58,380
But the donovans--They didn't get what they wanted.

825
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,000
And i'll call you after i get the results of the c.T. Urogram.

826
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,030
See what i did there?I didn't barge in and start yelling.

827
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:15,250
I waited for you to finish because i respect you professionally.

828
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,590
Well,yay for you.

829
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,060
And that wasn't a pity patient.

830
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,700
That's what,in doctor circles,is called a referral,

831
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,410
the proper response to which is,thank you,dr.Freedman,

832
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,900
for referring me this interesting case.

833
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,660
Oh,i'm sorry.Thank you,cooper.

834
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,440
Thank you for making me feel like a failure.

835
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,550
It's not bad enough that i failed at pacific wellcare.

836
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,880
Now my boyfriend's wrangling me patients off a bondage chat room 

837
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,150
because he doesn't believe i can get them on my own.

838
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,700
Oh,you know what?Shut up.Shut up.

839
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,300
You can't reinvent yourself overnight.It takes times.

840
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,620
And you cat do this all on your own,and you don't have to.

841
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,710
You're part of a couple now.

842
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,490
We do things together.You help me.I help you.

843
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,500
Admit it.You need me.I'm awesome.

844
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,680
So this referral you sent me,you met him on a bondage site?

845
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,440
Ink there were other people on that site who could use a sexologist?

846
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,850
Say i'm awesome.

847
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,750
Answer the question.

848
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,030
Maybe i will...

849
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,900
If you say i'm awesome.

850
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,550
So i'm just gone?

851
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,500
Erased?

852
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,300
i'm just suppod to walk away?

853
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,540
I love her.

854
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,400
You love who she was,jimmy,

855
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,830
and she loved you,too.

856
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,420
But...Memory is a funny thing.

857
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,570
Memory and emotion get all wrapped up with each other,

858
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,050
and sometimes it's hard to pull them apart.

859
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,610
She's happy now.

860
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,670
You did this.

861
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,500
This isn't the way it was supposed to be.

862
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:49,890
No,no,it isn't.I wish we could offer you more.

863
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,000
But...

864
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:56,040
All you can really do is try to be happy for her.

865
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,750
Try and move on.

866
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,210
Addison?

867
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,330
Sam.Are you okay?

868
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,490
Come on in.

869
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,420
Oh. I thought you said it was an emergency.

870
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,700
He's hiding underneath the couch,i think.

871
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,790
I can't get him to come out.

00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,460
I've tried the--The nip,the squeaky toy,the cat boa.

873
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,130
And then i tried this.

874
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,700
Okay,that is wrong on so many levels.

875
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,610
No,he took a couple swats at it.Why won't he come out?

876
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,820
Because it's nasty,and because he doesn't feel like it.

877
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,830
He's a cat.That's what cats do.

878
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,880
Sort of takes the fun out of it.

879
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,210
Let's try this.

880
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,780
Cat whisperer.

881
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,820
Look at...

882
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,720
So i take it he's staying?

883
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,870
I'm keeping him.

884
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,150
I...Have a cat.

885
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,250
