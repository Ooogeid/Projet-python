1
00:00:38,682 --> 00:00:41,050
And, uh,
good luck with your arm.

2
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,285
Ah. (groans)

3
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:46,020
(pete) you okay?
No, something-

4
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:49,524
Oh, it burns.
Help him, or he's gonna
pull out the neuro connectors.

5
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:50,858
Mm. Ah.

6
00:00:50,893 --> 00:00:52,894
(pants)

7
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,462
Ah.

8
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:56,898
You implanted a bolt
in his arm?
Osseous integration.

9
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,634
It's the only way
to carry the weight.
I know what it is.
It's also illegal.

10
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:02,470
In this country.
I sent him to sweden.
Ah!

11
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:05,206
Ah! Mm.
Okay, it's infected.
He's burning up.

12
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,475
We've gotta get him
to the hospital.

13
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:09,077
(wheelchair motor whirs)

14
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,112
(dell) okay, well,
maya's in your office.

15
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:13,981
She wouldn't even look a
in the car on the way over here,

16
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:15,626
And now you got sam and naomi
in the conference room.

17
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:19,802
Do you want to tell me
what's going on?
No, I can't, dell.
I wish I could, but I can't.

18
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:21,391
Guys, um,
very pregnant woman

19
00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:22,948
Squatting up and down
in the hallway?
Not mine.

20
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:26,299
Shs mine. Lynn mcdonald. She's
committed to natural childbirth.

21
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:27,453
She's been in labor
for two days.

22
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:30,159
Her water finally broke
last night.
Ooh. This isn't working.

23
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,075
Do you have anything spicy
in the fridge?

24
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,910
Like maybe-maybe
a chimichanga, huh?

25
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:37,905
That'll speed up
the labor, right?
Yeah, I'll order you something.

26
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,771
Yeah. Okay, baby, come out.

27
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:43,236
(exhales deeply)
and come out.

28
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,699
(exhales)
and... Come out.

29
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,864
<i>Well, let's go check out
your progress.
And come out.</i>

30
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,959
Okay, addison. What's this
important case that, uh...

31
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:52,679
Hey, maya girl.
Hey.

32
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:56,176
What's up? Wait. Did you have
a half a day today?
No, no, no.

33
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:59,239
Was I supposed to-
no, no, no. I always keep
the half days in my calendar.

34
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:01,554
I keep 'em
in my calendar, too.
It's not a half day.

35
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:04,572
Maya has something
that she needs to tell you.

36
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:09,492
(clears throat)

37
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:12,898
I...

38
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:17,804
Um...

39
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,244
(clears throat)

40
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:21,660
I...

41
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:28,921
Maya's pregnant.

42
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:35,994
No, she's not.

43
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:37,215
How?

44
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:39,809
When did you start
having s-

45
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:42,716
Wait. No. No, okay.
This is-this isn't possible.

46
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:45,279
We dis dssed this.
Discussed birth control.

47
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:47,183
Your-two doctors.

48
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:49,735
Both your parents are doctors.
How could you be pregnant?

49
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:52,066
How could this be happening?

50
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:53,937
What were-
what were you thinking?

51
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:56,460
Hey, where you going?
Our daughter just told us

52
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:57,876
That-that-that
she is pregnant.

53
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,764
We need to talk about this.
I can't.

54
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,920
<i>Mom-
naomi, we are her parents.</i>

55
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:05,628
I can't.

57
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,611
(sighs)

58
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:23,090
Naomi walked away.

59
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,775
Our daughter is pregnant,
and naomi walked away.
I know.

60
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,089
She's in shock.
She's dealing with it.I'm suppot

61
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,772
Until she decides
that she's ready?

62
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:33,263
We need to talk
to our daughter now.

63
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:34,907
Sam, this isn't
the first time

64
00:03:34,942 --> 00:03:36,207
I've delivered
this kind of news.

65
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:39,410
People need time. Give...
Give naomi some time.

66
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:42,994
Colin, you have
a severe infection.

67
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,010
How long
has it been hurting?

68
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:48,754
A month. I thought
it was normal pain.

69
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:49,935
And I was afraid
that if it was the bolt,

70
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,541
Then I couldn't keep the arm.
Well, dr. Wilder feels
the bolt should come out.

71
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:58,169
No. Can't we do
more antibiotics or something?
Well, what do you say,
dr. Wilder?

72
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,911
You specialize
in infectious disease.

73
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:02,157
You know alternative treatments.
What are his options?

74
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:03,755
There has to be
something up your sleeve

75
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,567
Since you have two of them.
There are
experimental protocols,

76
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:10,532
But the f.D.A. Hasn't completed
safety studies,

77
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:12,942
And there are reports
of severe side effects.

78
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:15,337
I'm sorry. The bolt is
the source of the infection,

79
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:16,917
And the safest thing to do
is remove it

80
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:18,667
Before the infection spreads.

81
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:23,122
Before I deployed,
I got engaged.

82
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,282
We wrote letters,
we planned the whole thing,

83
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:26,987
Right down to the dance,

84
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:29,346
Which requires me
to dip her to the floor.

85
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,285
Now I'm living up
to my part of this.

86
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,906
I'm going to hold her
in my arms-both arms-

87
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,101
And I'm going to dance with her
the way I promised.

88
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:40,002
You came back alive.
You're healthy and alive.

89
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:42,828
I know you planned for more,
but I cannot treat you

90
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:44,772
In a way that will
jeopardize your health.
Dr. Wilder-

91
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:46,624
Colin, this infection
could kill you.

92
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,100
I know that's not
what your fiancÃ©e wants.

93
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,471
(violet) why do they do this?

94
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,043
Why does the hospital
keep sending me samples?

95
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:59,369
It's like "gaslight,"
but with baby stuff.

96
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,089
"gaslight"? Famous movie?

97
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:06,168
Never saw it.
Ingrid bergman.

98
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:09,103
Her husband
tries to drive her crazy.
Uh, when the petermans
get here,

99
00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:11,544
Will you put them
in exam room three?
I'm using exam room three.

100
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,583
Oh, actually room three
is for pediatrics.

101
00:05:13,618 --> 00:05:17,099
And I have a 7 year old with
a urinary tract infection.

102
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:22,631
It's-it's about a marriage
that ends badly.

103
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:25,491
"gaslight."

104
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:38,511
Marsha.
Hi. Violet turner.

105
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,082
Uh, here's the situation-

106
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:42,665
I don't want
any more baby stuff.

107
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,359
So no diaper cream samples.

108
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:45,860
I've-I've called,
I've e-mailed,

109
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:47,429
I've mail-mailed
for the past six months,

110
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:51,332
But the hospital
just keeps sending it.
Most new mothers appreciate
our little freebies.

111
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:54,109
Well, I am not a new mother.
How old is your baby?

112
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,864
That's not what I meant.

113
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:58,582
I am not a new or an old
or any kind of mother.

114
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:01,009
I don't have a baby anymore.

115
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:03,304
Oh. Oh, my god.

116
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,700
I'm so sorry for your loss.

117
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:07,276
They're god's
littlest angels,

118
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:09,299
The ones we lose.

119
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,451
Could you just get
the form?

120
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:13,923
Of course.

121
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:17,618
I'm sorry, too,
for your loss.

122
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:20,018
Oh, no, no. It's just-
I- I was just-

123
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:21,687
No, no, no. You don't
have to explain. I-I get it.

124
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:24,648
I- I-
I lost my wife today.

125
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:26,116
Oh, my god.

126
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:28,428
A sentence you never think
you're gonna have to say,

127
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:30,803
You know, "I lost-
I lost my wife."

128
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:33,787
And, uh, every time
you say it,

129
00:06:33,822 --> 00:06:35,450
You think you're not gonna
be able to breathe,

130
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:37,201
And it's like-it's like
somebody shot you or something.

131
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:39,281
And then I-and then I hear

132
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,483
That you lost your child-
your baby-and it's-

133
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:43,618
It, like, gives it
perspective, you know?

134
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,521
It-it's-it's-it helps me
to know you lost your child.

135
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:49,324
And I know that's
a horrible thing to say to you.

136
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:52,863
Um... My wife's dead,
and I've offended you,

137
00:06:52,898 --> 00:06:54,450
And I'm sorry...

138
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:56,554
For your loss.

139
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:58,709
No, no. I'm-I'm sorry
for your loss.

140
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:01,982
They gave me this bag
with her... Belongings.

141
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:03,209
It's...

142
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:05,942
(exhales) it's funny.

143
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:07,951
I thought there'd be more
to take home.

144
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:10,612
Do you need...

145
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:14,715
Can I help you?
Is there anything I can do?

146
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,130
Uh, no. No, no.
I- I'm just waiting.

147
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:18,653
A friend's picking me up,
so...

148
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,741
Okay.

149
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,623
Well...

150
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:24,634
It was nice to meet you.

151
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:26,314
I'm nathan pilsman.

152
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:27,242
Violet turner.

153
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:28,819
It's nice to meet you,
violet turner.

154
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,986
Well, not nice,
but... It's nice.

155
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,912
(whirring)

156
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:41,053
(footsteps approach)

157
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:43,598
You can't walk.

158
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:45,707
You're black.
What game are we playing?

159
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:48,469
The day
that you found out...

160
00:07:49,423 --> 00:07:52,349
When they told you that,
uh, your legs-

161
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:54,159
That you would-you would
never walk again,

162
00:07:54,194 --> 00:07:56,459
That must have been
the worst day of your life.

163
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:58,493
How did you deal with it?

164
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,763
Why would you assume thateen
that was my worst day?Our life.

165
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,354
Losing my legs
changed my life,

166
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:08,359
But, uh, it certainlythateen
didn't ruin it.

167
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:09,304
There's a period
of adjustment,

168
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:12,709
But... You deal with it.

169
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:17,115
You're full of crap.

170
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:22,508
(elevator bell dings)

171
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,120
(indistinct conversations)

172
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,164
Naomi, what-what are you
doing here?

173
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:38,952
Mom, what are you doing?

174
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:40,105
What's going on?

175
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,790
Naomi,
what is going on?

176
00:08:43,713 --> 00:08:46,417
I need you to give maya
an abortion.
What?

177
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:48,971
Nai.
Mom, no.
I don't want an abortion.

178
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,040
I don't care what you want.
But, mom-

179
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:54,483
Give her an abortion.

180
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:58,366
I can't believe
I slapped her.

181
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,579
I hit my child.

182
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:02,065
You were upset, clearly.

183
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,638
It's not an easy thing
to deal with.

184
00:09:03,672 --> 00:09:07,870
I know, I know, but I...
Well, I can't-I lost it.

185
00:09:08,344 --> 00:09:10,832
But c-can you believe her?

186
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:14,549
Can you believe her
saying no to me?

187
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:16,184
What?

188
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:18,499
You ordered her
to have an abortion.

189
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,959
So putting aside the fact that
you are personally against it-

190
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,733
You can't make someone
have an abortion, nai.

191
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:29,353
No, no, no. This is-this-this
is not up for discussion.

192
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:32,389
I think it needs to be.
Well, you know what? If you're
not gonna do it, that's fine.

193
00:09:32,424 --> 00:09:35,522
I will find another doctor
who will.
Okay, I don't even know
who I'm talking to right now.

194
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:37,732
This is not you.
It's the opposite of you.

195
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:39,730
You-you give people babies,

196
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:42,471
And whether or not I agree
with your stand on this issue,

197
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:47,007
This isn't you.
Don't do something now that you
will he yourself for later.

198
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:50,059
Do you hate yourself
for your abortions?

199
00:09:50,094 --> 00:09:51,514
Either of you?

200
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:55,388
No, I don't hate myself.
But I do think about it.

201
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:57,358
It stays with you even if you
do it for the right reasons,

202
00:09:57,392 --> 00:10:01,277
And it is not a casual decision
that you can make for maya.

203
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:05,243
This-this is my family.
You do not judge my family!

204
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:07,650
We're not judging.
You know that.
Look, this has hit you hard,

205
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:09,832
And that can make you change
what you believe-
stop it. Stop it.

206
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:12,186
(voice breaking) stop acting
like you understand,

207
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:13,458
Because you don't.

208
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:15,346
You don't.
This is my child.

209
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,671
<i>This is my child we are
talking about, my child...</i>

210
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:21,606
Who I've done everything in
my power to raise and protect.

211
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,921
And now she's gone
and done something stupid-

212
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,054
Stupid-
that'sonna ruin her life,

213
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:27,021
And I'm not
gonna let that happen.

214
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:29,957
I am her mother.
I am her mother.
Naomi-

215
00:10:29,992 --> 00:10:32,193
You have no right. You have
no moral high ground.

216
00:10:32,227 --> 00:10:34,055
You walked away
from your child.

217
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:38,366
If you can live with that,
I can live with this.

218
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:43,274
She's just upset. You-

219
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,353
I know.

220
00:10:44,388 --> 00:10:47,734
(knocks on doorjamb)
(clears throat) uh,
I know this is a bad time,

221
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:50,144
But my patient-I-I could
really use your help.

222
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:54,263
Yes. Please.
Tell me she needs surgery.

223
00:10:54,298 --> 00:10:56,175
That I can do.

224
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,705
Oh, don't need your help
opening a door.

225
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,526
You're n very good
at taking help, are you?

226
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:09,055
Oh, actually, I am. Your idea
about experimental protocols?

227
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,633
I contacted my friend

228
00:11:10,668 --> 00:11:12,853
At the f.D.A.,
got the info, went with it.

229
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:16,720
You're not taking out
colin's bolt?
You might be afraid to take
a risk, but I'm not.

230
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:18,531
I assumed
naomi brought you in

231
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:19,919
Because you were
just as cuttinedge

232
00:11:19,954 --> 00:11:21,018
As everyone else around here.

233
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:23,177
I didn't realize you were
the safe alternative.

234
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:25,212
All right, you know what?
You-hey. Hey. Hey.

235
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:28,182
You can't just say sething
like that and roll away.

236
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:30,918
Can't hear you
over the noise of my chair.
(elevator bell dings)

237
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:33,599
Hey, pete.

238
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,645
Maya is pregnant.

239
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,811
Sam needs to drink.
You in?

240
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,020
(lynn) oh!

241
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:45,347
Uh, lynn's in a lot of pain.

242
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:47,019
She shows no sign
of fetal distress,

243
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:50,694
But her labor
isn't progressing.
I thought
after my water broke...

244
00:11:50,729 --> 00:11:53,275
Well, I can give you oxytocin
to speed up the labor

245
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,990
And something for the pain.
My birth plan says no drugs.

246
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:57,448
Lynn has a birth plan.

247
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,178
Oh, many pages...

248
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:01,979
And small font.
Yeah.

249
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:04,635
I want to experience
my child's birth.
Uh, lynn-

250
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,460
I did my homework, okay?

251
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:08,872
I understand
that there are procedures

252
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:10,482
That, you know,
may become necessary,

253
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:12,480
But except in a case
of extreme emergency,

254
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:15,821
You know, I want to be given
the opportunity to accept or-

255
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:17,892
Or refuse any procedure.

256
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:20,071
And as long as the baby's okay,
all right,

257
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,850
I want to have
a natural childbirth.

258
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:26,542
So to get the labor going,
I'm willing to try walking

259
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:29,482
Or castor oil
or nipple stimulation-

260
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:31,302
Well, it's
a little more involved.

261
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:33,425
If you fail to progress
in your labor,

262
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,230
You might want to consider
a c-section.
No. No.

263
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:39,701
Lynn, look, I know
this can be disappointing-
I've been in screaming pain
for hours.

264
00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:42,701
I'm not-I'm not worried
about being disappointed.

265
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:44,270
(grunts)

266
00:12:44,716 --> 00:12:47,104
You know, I-I married
a great guy.

267
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,958
You know,
I wanted to have kids.

268
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:51,465
He wasn't ready... Ever.

269
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:56,021
And... When the divorce
was final,

270
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:57,963
I decided to let loose.

271
00:12:57,998 --> 00:12:59,807
You know,
having a baby alone,

272
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:03,669
Being pregnant by some guy
that I met at the tequila bar,

273
00:13:03,704 --> 00:13:05,416
Is not every girl's dream,

274
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:08,210
But this is
what's happening, okay?

275
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,439
And I am having this baby.

276
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:11,114
So is it too much to ask

277
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:13,506
That one thing
goes according to plan?

278
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:17,706
(harper simon's "berkeley girl"
playing)

279
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:19,512
(sam) naomi has lost her mind.

280
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:23,491
I don't even know
who she was today.
Do you want maya
to have an abortion?

281
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:24,665
Well, that's the point.

282
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,033
I'm a guy. It's-
it's-it's not my choice.

283
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:29,703
Well, right, but do you
want her to-

284
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:32,200
Do I-I want her to not
be pregnant in the first place.

285
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:35,652
I want her
to never have had sex.

286
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:37,296
I want her to live in a world

287
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:40,078
Where there are chastity belts
and convents

288
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:44,526
And little boys
by the name of dink don't exist.

289
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:45,578
That-that's what I want.

290
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,724
So don't ask me
if I want...

291
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,546
My baby girl
to have an abortion.

292
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:54,172
Don't-don't ask me that.

293
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:56,065
âª blowin' down a country lane âª

294
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,796
Because the answer
is probably yes.

295
00:13:57,831 --> 00:14:00,107
âª she's got the s... âª

296
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:01,497
But it's not my choice.

297
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:03,255
You know,
it's not naomi's either.

298
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:06,271
Look, just be glad you
and charlotte don't have a kid.
Oh.

299
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:08,129
Once you have a child
with someone,

300
00:14:08,176 --> 00:14:10,391
You are tied
to them forever,

301
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:12,388
Even if they go nuts.
(scoffs)

302
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:15,116
(laughs)
I'm-I'm sorry.
I didn't...

303
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,418
(laughs)
I didn't mean that, man.

304
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:21,622
âª and the hills of echo park âª

305
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:24,925
My daughter's pregnant.

306
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,597
âª she is crinoline and satin âª

307
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,800
âª she is leopard skin
and lace âª

308
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,666
Oh, I'm still here.

309
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:36,675
But then, so are you.

310
00:14:37,602 --> 00:14:39,107
Well, I left and I came back.

311
00:14:39,142 --> 00:14:40,750
I thought about you
and I was worried.

312
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:45,191
You don't have
a friend coming, do you?

313
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:47,506
No.

314
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,749
I'm not ready.

315
00:14:50,732 --> 00:14:53,821
The thing is... I can't
leave without my wife.

316
00:14:55,138 --> 00:14:57,591
Obviously, I-I can't leave
with her.

317
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:00,501
So I can't leave.

318
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:02,463
âª...Berkeley girl âª

319
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:05,186
Can I sit with you
for a while?

320
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:06,392
Sure.

321
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:08,611
âª...The moon and the sun âª

322
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,549
âª oh âª

323
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:12,734
âª ah âª

324
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:14,874
Did you feel this way

325
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:17,878
When you lost your child?

326
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,876
Well... Yeah,
walking out that door

327
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,608
Was the hardest thing
I ever did.

328
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:26,346
But...

329
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,696
Yeah, yeah, I did
feel this way.

330
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:30,965
âª ooh âª

331
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,219
âª oh, berkeley girl âª

332
00:15:34,254 --> 00:15:35,953
I have this tingling

333
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:39,113
In-in my stump,
in my shoulder and my feet.

334
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,068
It's like they're asleep.
I can't wake them up.

335
00:15:41,102 --> 00:15:43,971
(motor whirs)

336
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:49,804
What is it?
What's happening?Rhythmically)

337
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,508
Uh, a side effect
of the antibiotics

338
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:53,475
Is neurotoxicity-
nerve damage.

339
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,382
Is this what dr. Wilder
was afraid of?

340
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:58,459
No. I'm gonna lower the dosage
on the antibiotic.

341
00:15:58,494 --> 00:16:00,514
That should lessen
the effect.

342
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:03,500
We'll give it a shot.

343
00:16:03,535 --> 00:16:05,993
(motor whirring)

344
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:12,099
Oh.

345
00:16:13,768 --> 00:16:17,705
Oh, god! Oh!

346
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:19,807
Oh! Oh!

347
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:23,644
Oh! G-oh!

348
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:30,150
(knock on door)

349
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,665
This is how today
should've gone dn.

350
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,147
When we found out at
our daughter was pregnant,

351
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:39,349
We should've cried
on each other's shoulders,

352
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:42,240
We should've listened to what
our daughter had to say,

353
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:44,298
And then the two of us,

354
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,006
Together, should have
discussed how to handle this.

355
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,498
That's not what happened.

356
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:51,775
Talk to me.
Deal with this.

357
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,210
I don't want to talk about it.

358
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:57,469
<i>And I am dealing with it.</i>

359
00:16:57,504 --> 00:16:59,766
Maybe not the way
you want me to, but...

360
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,740
It's the only way I can.

361
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:11,658
I'll do it.

362
00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:14,487
I'll have the abortion.

363
00:17:27,448 --> 00:17:28,915
Her.

364
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,784
Oh, yeah. That's grief.

365
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,853
Definitely.

366
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:35,389
Dead husband? Dead kid?

367
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:37,291
It's dead kid.

368
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:38,692
It's her face.

369
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:42,162
She's got dead kid face...
Like you.

370
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:44,898
I'm sorry. That didn't
come out right.

371
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:46,833
No, it's okay.
It's all right.

372
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:49,102
What do you mean
about my face?

373
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:50,537
It's your eyes.

374
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,472
You-you've been someplace

375
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:54,474
That most people
have never been.

376
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:55,909
You've survived something

377
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:57,911
That no one would have
wanted to survive.

378
00:17:57,945 --> 00:17:59,613
It's your eyes. It's...

379
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:02,716
They're, I don't know,
empty.

380
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,652
Well, I mean,
that could be just...

381
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:08,422
Doesn't have to be
dead kid.

382
00:18:08,456 --> 00:18:10,424
It could just be...

383
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,992
Bad life.

384
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:15,162
No, it's dead kid
or dead something.

385
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:17,431
What about me?

386
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:18,832
Your face?

387
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:21,201
I mean,
I know you don't know me,

388
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:23,303
But do I look different?

389
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:27,841
You look like
you're in shock, nathan.

390
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,379
You look like
something bad happened.

391
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:39,286
It's really nice of you
to sit here, you know,

392
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,254
But you don't-
you don't have to stay.

393
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:43,223
I'm sure that you have
someplace to be.

394
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:47,127
Uh... No, actually.
I don't.

395
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:49,496
Okay.

396
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,665
Okay.

397
00:18:55,303 --> 00:18:57,437
Sorry.

398
00:18:57,472 --> 00:18:59,706
I thought you'd be
at the gym.

399
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:02,109
I just came to get
the rest of my stuff.

400
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:03,677
Yeah, well, okay.

401
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:08,382
I bought the latex jumpsuit.

402
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,917
For me.
You bought it for me.

403
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:14,721
What, are you gonna have
some other woman wear it?

404
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:17,157
Well, so should I
give it to you

405
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:19,226
So you could wear it
for some other guy?

406
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,695
Cooper, we can do this.
We liked each other once.

407
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:23,230
Actually, we didn't.

408
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:25,499
We disliked each other,
and then we had sex,

409
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,401
And then we fell in love.

410
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:30,470
We never liked each other.

411
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:33,006
I guess you're right.

412
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,476
I think you should leave
the practice.

413
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:39,379
What?
I'll take out a loan.
I'll sell my car.

414
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:42,582
I'll do whatever it takes
to buy you out.
No.

415
00:19:42,617 --> 00:19:44,551
No?
No. I'm building a business.

416
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,887
I don't care
if you were there first.

417
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:50,157
I belong there just as much as
you do. I'm not going anywhere.

418
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:52,793
(hangers clatter)
useless, stupid love.

419
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:53,994
What?

420
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:55,796
Useless, stupid love!

421
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,564
Wasted time.

422
00:19:57,598 --> 00:20:00,467
Just take your latex jumpsuit.
Find another woman.

423
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:03,370
Have a blast with it!
Oh, I c-
I will! I can't wait.

424
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:06,039
That's my towel you're wearing.
I want it back.

425
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:07,808
(door closes)

426
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:09,910
(lynn) oh, god! Oh, god!

427
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:11,645
You're doing great, lynn.

428
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,181
Yeah. I feel great.

429
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:17,017
Uh, we-we could change
the music.

430
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:19,619
We haven't listened to
"chirping birds" yet.

431
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:21,621
I just wanted this
to be beautiful, you know?

432
00:20:21,656 --> 00:20:23,056
All my books said

433
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,826
That the way a child
comes into the world

434
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,227
Shapes them for life.

435
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:30,263
I just want to give him
the best chance

436
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:32,265
That he can have, you know?
Mm-hmm.

437
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,167
I- I don't want to shape him

438
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:38,305
To be some angry
or-or scared... (groans)

439
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:39,739
Damn it.

440
00:20:39,774 --> 00:20:41,308
Oh.

441
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:44,711
I want him to have
a good life.

442
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:47,147
Okay, look... No matter
how today works out,

443
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:49,983
Even if you decide
you can't take the pain,

444
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:52,219
You're still gonna have
plenty of opportunities

445
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:53,987
To shape your child's life.

446
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:56,756
So can I give you something
to help with the pain?

447
00:20:56,791 --> 00:21:00,060
No. Just give me
the chirping birds.
Okay.

448
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:02,162
Yeah.

449
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:03,697
<i>(birds chirp)</i>

450
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:06,666
How many have you done?

451
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:10,770
More than I can count.

452
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:12,239
And they've all...

453
00:21:12,273 --> 00:21:13,673
They've turned out...

454
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,642
Well, "fine"
isn't the word I'd use,

455
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,744
But without complications.

456
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:21,548
My daughter's having
an abortion tomorrow.

457
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:25,852
That in and of itself
is a complication.

458
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:29,456
Sam, is it weird
that it's me... Doing it?

459
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,491
No.
Would you prefer
that I get a-

460
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:34,694
I'd understand if-
no, you do it.

461
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:37,764
You do it the best you have
ever done anything.

462
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,534
Do it like your life
depends on it.

463
00:21:40,568 --> 00:21:43,103
(voice breaks) it's maya.

464
00:21:46,207 --> 00:21:49,876
Oh. Oh. Ugh.

465
00:21:49,944 --> 00:21:50,959
Colin, what happened?

466
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,296
Something's wrong.
I- I told 'em to call you. I-

467
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:54,767
I know you wanted to take
the bolt out.

468
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,341
You told me the antibiotics
were too risky, but I w-
this isn't even
the right dosage.

469
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,816
Dr. Fife lowered it. He-
it was-

470
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:03,385
He said
it was damaging my nerves

471
00:22:03,385 --> 00:22:05,780
And he said that his arm
wouldn't work and-ohh.

472
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:08,315
(vomits)
damn it.
The infection is spreading.

473
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:12,132
Get me a central line kit.
(groans)

474
00:22:17,018 --> 00:22:19,853
You have got to get
that bolt out.
I'll take it under advisement.

475
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:21,822
You-it-
this is his life,

476
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:24,224
And you are so concerned
with your invention.

477
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,726
It's what colin wanted.

478
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,227
It's what you sold him.

479
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,163
Naomi was right about you.

480
00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:30,597
You're full of crap.

481
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:33,534
You don't want to fix his arm.
You want to fix your legs.

482
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:35,536
No. I already tried,
and I can't.

483
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,572
Okay, is that supposed to
make me feel sorry for you?

484
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:41,308
I'm not doing this for me.
I've accepted what I lost

485
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:44,445
And I'll accept it for colin
as well, but not yet.
You just don't want to see it.

486
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:47,114
Maybe, and maybe there is
something out there

487
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:49,083
That we haven't
thought of yet.

488
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,119
Look, I'm not good at asking
for help, but I'm asking.

489
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:54,822
My patient wants to pick up
his life were it left off.

490
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:56,790
It may not be
what you would choose,

491
00:22:56,825 --> 00:22:58,759
But it's what he chooses.

492
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:00,694
So do it for him.

493
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:05,833
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.A.)</i>

494
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:08,001
(thud)

495
00:23:09,738 --> 00:23:11,905
(thud)

496
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:16,543
You did not just see that.

497
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:18,912
Isn't that what you
were wearing yesterday?

498
00:23:18,947 --> 00:23:21,315
Uh, yeah. Just...
Helping out a friend.

499
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:24,518
Want me to loan you
something?
Did you move
all your stuff in here?

500
00:23:24,552 --> 00:23:26,653
I sold my place.

501
00:23:26,688 --> 00:23:29,823
I know.
It was a rookie miake.

502
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:32,960
Giving it all up for a guy,
moving into cooper's apartment,

503
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,895
Moving into the practice
where he worked.

504
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:37,798
(chuckles) I changed my life
to be with him.

505
00:23:37,832 --> 00:23:39,900
I went all-in on forever.

506
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:42,436
Does cooper know that?
No point now.

507
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,871
He wants me out.

508
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:47,141
He wants to pretend we didn't
happen, that I don't exist.

509
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:52,112
Well, he thinks that's gonna
make him feel better.

510
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:53,580
But it won't.

511
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:55,783
It'll just make him feel...

512
00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:57,217
A- alone.

513
00:23:57,252 --> 00:24:00,788
I know the feeling.

514
00:24:00,822 --> 00:24:03,257
Me, too.

515
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,992
So...

516
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,262
Do you want to wear slutty
or professional?

517
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:10,697
(lynn) oh, dell!

518
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:13,333
Dell!

519
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,269
This is a big one!

520
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:17,237
Still?
I...

521
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:19,273
Aah!

522
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:21,575
âª

523
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:24,945
(man) âª it sure is hard
to be apart âª

524
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:26,780
âª but our tv show... âª

525
00:24:26,815 --> 00:24:28,749
So we're here.

526
00:24:28,783 --> 00:24:32,052
Okay. Is everybody, uh,
sure about this?

527
00:24:32,086 --> 00:24:34,221
Just... Do it.

528
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:36,323
âª

529
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:38,392
Maya.

530
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:42,663
âª does she still know âª

531
00:24:42,697 --> 00:24:45,933
âª they're the ones? âª

532
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:52,473
âª her favorite daughter's
favorite sons âª

533
00:24:52,507 --> 00:24:53,907
(knock on door)

534
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:55,909
I couldn't stay stairs.

535
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:57,845
Charlotte?
She won't leave.

536
00:24:57,879 --> 00:24:59,480
And then sam and naomi...

537
00:24:59,514 --> 00:25:01,682
I feel like I should-I should
do something for them,

538
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:04,918
Like I should send food
or something, but...
Well, nobody's sick.

539
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:06,820
Sending a tub of soup
isn't gonna help.

540
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:10,157
I know. What am I supposed
to do, pete?
About charlotte?

541
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:12,893
Accept it, move on. I mean,
there's nothing you can do.

542
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:15,596
Sam and naomi?
I don't know, man.

543
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,932
I... Maybe that's why
people send soup.

544
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:21,869
Nothing you can do.

545
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:26,607
âª you say you're worried âª

546
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:28,675
âª I say I am, too âª

547
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,211
âª it's okay, it's what
you're supposed to do âª

548
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:34,681
Do you remember the day
maya lost her first tooth?

549
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:37,651
It fell out in the yard.

550
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:40,387
We spent about four hours
looking for that thing

551
00:25:40,421 --> 00:25:42,322
Because without proof,

552
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:44,391
The tooth fairy
wouldn't pay up.

553
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:48,262
âª

554
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,097
And then there's today.

555
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,099
âª

556
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,701
(sighs) you know,
we're gonna get through this.

557
00:25:54,736 --> 00:25:57,671
Once this whole thin
is over and done,

558
00:25:57,705 --> 00:26:00,741
We're gonna get back there.

559
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:01,708
(exhales)

560
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:03,343
Say something!

561
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:04,912
Anything!

562
00:26:04,946 --> 00:26:06,880
What do you want me
to say?

563
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:09,716
You wa me to say that I did
the wrong thing? Okay.

564
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:11,251
I did the wrong thing.

565
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:14,154
Do I believe
that I'm going to hell

566
00:26:14,188 --> 00:26:17,090
For forcing our daughter
to have an abortion?

567
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:20,127
(voice breaking) absolutely.

568
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:23,230
Do I regret doing
what I had to do? No.

569
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:25,065
âª

570
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:26,533
I would do anything,

571
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:29,002
I would give my life
to protect her,

572
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:31,905
And if it means that I'm
going to hell, then fine.

573
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,340
I'm going to hell.

574
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,642
Oh, naomi-
I failed, sam.

575
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,078
(sobs) I failed...

576
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:41,648
First in our marriage,
and now at being a mother.

577
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,586
No. This is on both of us.

578
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,689
I thought I taught her
right from wrong.

579
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:50,691
But she didn't listen.

580
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:54,227
It's like nothing I did
made any difference.

581
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,832
I failed.

582
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:03,003
âª

583
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:08,774
You're gonna experience
some discomfort

584
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:12,445
And some bleeding afterward
for about a week.

585
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:15,948
The entire procedure
won't take long.

586
00:27:15,983 --> 00:27:18,584
I'm gonna use this instrument
attached to suction

587
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:20,186
To remove the pregnancy.

588
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,954
You'll have some cramping,

589
00:27:22,022 --> 00:27:24,123
Just for a few seconds.

590
00:27:24,157 --> 00:27:27,159
Do you understand?

591
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:29,061
Maya, it's really-

592
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:32,698
It's important that you tell me
whether or not you understand.

593
00:27:35,302 --> 00:27:37,637
No.

594
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:39,071
I don't understand.

595
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:41,040
Okay.

596
00:27:41,074 --> 00:27:43,609
Ask me.
(clears throat)

597
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:47,813
Anything you want to know.

598
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:52,818
All my life, my mom told me
that she would never...

599
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:54,854
Never do this,

600
00:27:54,888 --> 00:27:56,789
That from the second
they're conceived,

601
00:27:56,823 --> 00:27:59,325
A baby is a life-
a gift from god-

602
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:01,427
And that abortion is wrong...

603
00:28:01,461 --> 00:28:03,195
That it's murder.

604
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,099
Yes. That's what
your mother believes.

605
00:28:07,134 --> 00:28:09,502
What about you?

606
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,271
What do you believe?

607
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:18,511
I believe that until a fetus
can survive on its own

608
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:20,012
Outside the mother's body,

609
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:21,914
That it is not a life.

610
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:24,317
I believe that life
begins at birth.

611
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:27,386
So you think my mom
was wrong before

612
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:31,123
And that she's right now
because she wants me to do this?

613
00:28:31,158 --> 00:28:34,860
I think that your mother
and I think differently.

614
00:28:34,895 --> 00:28:36,629
That doesn't help me.

615
00:28:36,663 --> 00:28:39,098
Maya, I can't help you
with this decision.

616
00:28:39,132 --> 00:28:41,067
I can and will give you
an abortion

617
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:43,002
Or I can offer other options

618
00:28:43,036 --> 00:28:44,971
And see you through
this pregnancy.

619
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:47,506
But I can't help you decide.

620
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:52,244
I'm 15 years old.
Which is why you shouldn't
have been having sex

621
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,646
In the first place.

622
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,282
And I say that
as your aunt addie, okay?

623
00:28:56,316 --> 00:28:58,951
But... As your dtor, maya,

624
00:28:58,986 --> 00:29:02,622
Since you already
have had sex

625
00:29:02,656 --> 00:29:05,458
And because
you are pregnant...

626
00:29:05,492 --> 00:29:07,426
Maya...

627
00:29:07,461 --> 00:29:09,095
I know this is hard.

628
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:11,697
I know that this is...

629
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:15,301
An unimaginably difficult,
grown-up decision,

630
00:29:15,335 --> 00:29:17,737
And it's not fair
that you have to make it.

631
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:19,605
But you did a grown-up thing.

632
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,541
And now you are in
a grown-up predicament.

633
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:24,510
So now it doesn't matter
what I believe

634
00:29:24,544 --> 00:29:26,912
Or what your mother believes.

635
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:29,882
What matters is what
you believe. It's up to you.

636
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:31,384
But my mom said I-

637
00:29:31,418 --> 00:29:33,319
Until the 24th week
of pregnancy,

638
00:29:33,353 --> 00:29:37,056
What a woman does with
her own body is her business.

639
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,593
It's law. It's the law, maya.

640
00:29:40,627 --> 00:29:43,462
And of lot of fine women
fought a long time

641
00:29:43,497 --> 00:29:47,700
<i>To give you the right to do
what you think is best.</i>

642
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:50,670
Your body, your choice.

643
00:29:50,704 --> 00:29:54,240
Maya, you know
what you want to do.

644
00:29:54,274 --> 00:29:56,275
In your heart, in your gut,

645
00:29:56,309 --> 00:29:58,177
You know which way
you want to go.

646
00:29:58,211 --> 00:30:00,346
I've done this enough
to know that.

647
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,982
You know what you want to do.

648
00:30:03,016 --> 00:30:05,785
Okay? You just need
to tell me.

649
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:09,689
(lady of the sunshine's
"silr revolver" playing)

650
00:30:09,723 --> 00:30:11,691
âª hey, mama âª

651
00:30:11,725 --> 00:30:13,659
I know you're tired,
but on this next contraction,

652
00:30:13,694 --> 00:30:16,062
I'm really gonna need you
to push.
I can't.

653
00:30:16,096 --> 00:30:18,097
Yes, you can.
It hurts.

654
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:20,032
Come on, lynn. This is
what you wanted, okay?

655
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:23,002
You can do it.
(crying) I was wng, okay?
My birth plan is stupid.

656
00:30:23,036 --> 00:30:25,471
It's not working. I've been
awake for three days.

657
00:30:25,505 --> 00:30:27,907
I feel like I've been
run over by a train.

658
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:30,810
Okay, just turn off
the hippie-ass flute sic

659
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:33,245
And give me some drugs, now!
O- okay, okay.

660
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,915
I- I can't give you drugs.
But I want drugs!

661
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:38,718
Okay? You said
I could change my mind!

662
00:30:38,752 --> 00:30:42,221
Okay. I know it hurts,
but we're almost there.

663
00:30:42,255 --> 00:30:45,257
And that's why I can't
give you any drugs.
Please stop saying that.
(sobs)

664
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:46,659
Okay, listen...

665
00:30:46,693 --> 00:30:49,128
You had a plan,
and you've stuck to it,

666
00:30:49,162 --> 00:30:51,897
And not everyone can do that,
but you did.

667
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:55,034
And I am here with you, and we
are going to get through this.

668
00:30:55,068 --> 00:30:58,237
I promise.
(whimpers) oh.

669
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:00,573
Now push.

670
00:31:00,607 --> 00:31:02,141
(screaming)

671
00:31:02,175 --> 00:31:05,244
Obviously the results
weren't what we hoped.

672
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,247
I know it was just metal.

673
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:10,649
But... I swear,

674
00:31:10,684 --> 00:31:13,452
When I caught that tennis ball,
I could feel it.

675
00:31:13,487 --> 00:31:16,188
It was fuzzy,
just a little bit of give.

676
00:31:16,223 --> 00:31:18,991
We have to remove the bolt
and a margin of tissue

677
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:21,026
To make sure
the infection is gone.

678
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:25,965
And we may need to remove
the rest of your arm,

679
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:28,534
Possibly all the way up
to your shoulder.

680
00:31:28,568 --> 00:31:31,237
That's one option. It would
definitely save your life.

681
00:31:31,271 --> 00:31:33,539
But...
But what?

682
00:31:33,573 --> 00:31:35,474
There's been some success

683
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:37,910
With biodegradable
antibiotic implants.

684
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:39,411
It's risky.
It requires surgery.

685
00:31:39,446 --> 00:31:41,280
We'd have to implant
the antibiotics

686
00:31:41,314 --> 00:31:44,016
Directly next to
the bolt site.

687
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,786
Give you the life you want,
let you dance at your wedding.

688
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,854
âª oh, lover âª

689
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:50,456
(exhales deeply)

690
00:31:51,925 --> 00:31:53,659
âª pass the silver âª

691
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:55,661
âª silver revolver âª

692
00:31:55,695 --> 00:31:57,630
(woman) okay, you guys ready?
(laughs)

693
00:31:57,664 --> 00:31:59,532
(children laugh)
okay, slow down.

694
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:01,066
We never had kids.

695
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:03,068
My wife wanted kids.

696
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:05,538
âª

697
00:32:05,572 --> 00:32:08,741
I think we should leave.

698
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:10,743
Look, you-you have
lost someone here

699
00:32:10,777 --> 00:32:12,344
Who's very important to you.

700
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:14,113
And you're afraid

701
00:32:14,147 --> 00:32:16,448
That if you go home
and walk into an empty room,

702
00:32:16,483 --> 00:32:19,385
That'll mean
you're really alone.
I will be alone.

703
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:21,120
No. I'll...

704
00:32:21,154 --> 00:32:22,822
I'll go with you.

705
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:27,726
âª it's all in my head,
it's all in my head âª

706
00:32:29,095 --> 00:32:30,729
âª it's all in my head âª

707
00:32:30,764 --> 00:32:34,533
âª it's all in my head âª

708
00:32:37,404 --> 00:32:39,071
I didn't do it.

709
00:32:39,105 --> 00:32:40,639
What?

710
00:32:40,674 --> 00:32:42,308
I'm not having
an abortion.

711
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:45,678
âª it's in my... âª

712
00:32:45,712 --> 00:32:48,214
Mom! Stop.
What are you doing?

713
00:32:48,248 --> 00:32:49,682
Naomi.

714
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:51,417
Ow! Ow!
Hey!

715
00:32:51,451 --> 00:32:53,017
If you're coming in,
you better be taking pictures.

716
00:32:53,017 --> 00:32:55,727
Is that what you want?
Addison, a little help.

717
00:32:55,922 --> 00:32:58,791
I am not gonna let you
ruinour life, little girl.
All right, lynn.
Now come on. Push.

718
00:32:58,825 --> 00:33:00,082
You think you know what
you want? You have no idea.

719
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:03,896
You have no idea what you want.
Look at that. Look at that.

720
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,698
Okay.

721
00:33:05,732 --> 00:33:08,534
(cries) hi. Hi.
(baby coos)

722
00:33:08,568 --> 00:33:10,636
âª

723
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,605
But look at that.

724
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:15,074
(fusses)

725
00:33:15,108 --> 00:33:18,010
âª all I've ever been to myself âª

726
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:20,880
âª is my own enemy âª

727
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:27,360
(maya) mom.

728
00:33:27,394 --> 00:33:30,063
Mom. Mommy!

729
00:33:42,877 --> 00:33:46,379
(crying)
I can't. I'm sorry.

730
00:33:46,413 --> 00:33:48,882
I- I can't.

731
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:50,617
(addison) nai.
It's okay. Shh.

732
00:33:50,651 --> 00:33:52,519
(sobbing)

733
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:57,857
(sighs) shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

734
00:33:57,892 --> 00:33:59,826
Naomi. Nai.

735
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,828
This isn't
the end of the world.

736
00:34:01,862 --> 00:34:04,297
You will get past this.
I need to get outta here.

737
00:34:04,331 --> 00:34:07,433
Don't do this. You don't want to
turn your back on your child.

738
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:10,336
You just shut up!
Just for once, just shut up!

739
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:13,740
For a minute, for now,
shut up!

740
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:23,816
Well... This is fun.

741
00:34:25,486 --> 00:34:27,320
It's fine.

742
00:34:27,354 --> 00:34:30,490
(chuckles) bet you'd be
a great date.

743
00:34:30,524 --> 00:34:33,459
If my wife hadn't just died,
I'd ask you out.

744
00:34:33,494 --> 00:34:36,996
(chuckles)that was funny.

745
00:34:41,502 --> 00:34:43,770
Let's try
walking through the door.

746
00:34:56,684 --> 00:34:58,651
We thought she had a cold.

747
00:34:58,686 --> 00:35:02,188
A few years ago, we were
supposed to go on a skiing trip,

748
00:35:02,222 --> 00:35:04,090
And we thought she had a cold.

749
00:35:04,124 --> 00:35:06,092
But it never went away.

750
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:07,627
Cancer.

751
00:35:07,661 --> 00:35:10,830
And I-I knew it was coming.
I knew it.

752
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:12,231
So I slept there.

753
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:15,168
I slept in that hospital
with her for months.

754
00:35:15,202 --> 00:35:16,636
This house...

755
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,572
It was the last time
we were happy together.

756
00:35:19,607 --> 00:35:22,709
(diane birch's "magic view"
playing)

757
00:35:25,713 --> 00:35:28,915
âª turning âª

758
00:35:28,949 --> 00:35:30,917
âª turning are the tables... âª

759
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:32,752
One step at a time.

760
00:35:32,786 --> 00:35:36,222
âª here before me âª

761
00:35:36,256 --> 00:35:41,661
âª oh, but you're so lovely âª

762
00:35:41,695 --> 00:35:43,129
âª lovely as you are âª

763
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:46,466
âª I know you'll leave me âª

764
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,767
(inhales deeply)

765
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:54,140
âª high up in a tree
I can't climb down âª

766
00:35:54,174 --> 00:35:55,908
I thought...

767
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:58,177
I thought it would kill me.

768
00:35:58,212 --> 00:36:01,147
Stepping back into this house,
I thought it would-

769
00:36:01,181 --> 00:36:03,583
I thought it would
make her more gone.

770
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:07,654
But... She's here.

771
00:36:07,688 --> 00:36:10,590
She loved it here.

772
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,026
And we were happy
in this house.

773
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,628
Thank you.

774
00:36:15,663 --> 00:36:18,598
âª burning âª

775
00:36:18,632 --> 00:36:19,999
(sniffles)

776
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:21,267
Violet?

777
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:23,102
That dead kid face?

778
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:25,705
âª I'm turning âª

779
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:27,273
âª turning into me âª

780
00:36:27,307 --> 00:36:29,208
It's not my son.

781
00:36:29,243 --> 00:36:30,877
âª...Heaven âª

782
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:34,047
My son isn't dead.

783
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:36,749
It's me.

784
00:36:36,784 --> 00:36:39,652
I walked away from my son.

785
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:42,088
I gave him away.

786
00:36:42,122 --> 00:36:45,391
So... I don't have
a bag of his stuff

787
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:48,861
Or a last place
where we were happy.

788
00:36:48,896 --> 00:36:51,431
He never
got to see me happy.

789
00:36:51,465 --> 00:36:54,167
(crying) he's only
6 months old,

790
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:56,903
And now I've let
a total stranger

791
00:36:56,937 --> 00:36:58,404
Believe he's dead.

792
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:00,306
I have a son...

793
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,142
And his name is lucas.

794
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:06,012
(crying)

795
00:37:06,046 --> 00:37:09,115

796

797
00:37:10,984 --> 00:37:13,019
(tires squeal)

798
00:37:13,053 --> 00:37:16,456
Was I too nice to you, huh?
Is that what happened?

799
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,958
You thought
I was a nice guy, huh?
Dr. Bennett-

800
00:37:18,992 --> 00:37:21,427
Shut up. Shut the...
You shoulda been afraid of me.

801
00:37:21,462 --> 00:37:22,795
You shoulda been terrified.

802
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,797
My face shoulda been
in your head

803
00:37:24,832 --> 00:37:26,733
Every single moment
you were with maya.

804
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:29,368
So look at me right now.

805
00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:32,805
Look long and hard
and remember me saying,

806
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,741
You will never
hurt maya again.

807
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:35,942
Okay.

808
00:37:35,976 --> 00:37:38,177
You got my daughter pregnant.

809
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:40,146
So help me god, if I could-

810
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,814
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

811
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:43,516
Maya's pregnant?

812
00:37:48,756 --> 00:37:50,857
You didn't know.

813
00:37:50,891 --> 00:37:54,060
(students speaking indistinctly)

814
00:37:54,094 --> 00:37:56,262
Dr. Bennett...

815
00:37:56,296 --> 00:37:58,331
I love her.

816
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,108
Did you ever find your shoe?

817
00:38:09,143 --> 00:38:12,011
No. Finish helping
that friend?

818
00:38:12,045 --> 00:38:13,880
Yeah, I did.

819
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:20,119
I want to punch him.

820
00:38:20,154 --> 00:38:22,355
I didn't want
a relationship, damn it.

821
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:24,757
I was fine being alone.

822
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,630
You know what I miss?
Your martinis.

823
00:38:30,664 --> 00:38:33,533
You sure do knowhow to.

824
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:36,335
No, I was just thinking that
you have nowhere to go,

825
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,138
And hotel rooms are...
Cold and empty, and, um,

826
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:42,041
I just-I just don't know
how to make a good martini.

827
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:45,444
You're inviting me
to stay with you?

828
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:48,214
Uh, well, you know,
just until

829
00:38:48,248 --> 00:38:50,516
You get things sorted out.

830
00:38:50,551 --> 00:38:54,687
You're not gonna get all talky
about feelings or hair-
I just want a martini.

831
00:38:54,721 --> 00:38:57,790

âª old days and memories âª

âª to glories that you... âª

836
00:39:09,536 --> 00:39:12,138
What, you're not gonna make
some warm-hearted comment

837
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:14,140
About me
being in a wheelchair?

838
00:39:14,174 --> 00:39:16,108
I thought we were on a roll.

839
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:18,711
Sorry.

840
00:39:18,745 --> 00:39:20,580
You okay?

00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:41,968
And I don't believe in abortion.

Damn right,

860
00:40:17,504 --> 00:40:21,107
âª

861
00:40:22,476 --> 00:40:24,510

862

863

The be thing or...

864
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:33,252

869

You do what you think

871
00:40:45,365 --> 00:40:49,402
Meet a guy, fall in love,
have a family.

But you have to be specific.

873
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:55,708
Be older than 15,
meet the right guy,

874
00:40:55,742 --> 00:40:58,110
Stay in love.

875
00:40:58,145 --> 00:40:59,612
