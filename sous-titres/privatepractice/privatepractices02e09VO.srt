1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,970
I am sexless.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,470
I am without sex,wh-which can be healthy.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,890
Celibacy in some cultures is seen as a sign of strength.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,290
So I am strong.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,330
I am a strong,healthy woman.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,950
-I miss sex.
-What are you talking about?

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,650
You've got a gorns ma sleeping in your bed.

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,660
Yeah,that's all he is doing in my bed.

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,610
Doctor's orders.

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,230
You have sex on the horizon.

11
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,730
Which is better than having had amazing sex in your recent past with

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,420
no visible sign of it happening ever again.

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,040
My brother.

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,050
He's not coming back in town,is he?

15
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,210
-Hey,don't attach.
-What?

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,830
Celibacy is a sign of strength.

17
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,950
Really,violet?

18
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,740
I mean,really,is it?

19
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,650
No!

20
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,930
I'm dying.I got nothin'.

21
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,950
worse,I got cooper,who is so angry about charlotte

22
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,450
that all he can do is talk about her.

23
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,340
I need a man.I need a non-cooper man.

24
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,080
You know what I need?

25
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,890
I need a cup of coffee that you don't have to walk two blocks to get.

26
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,800
I cannot believe e coffee cart is gone.

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,520
I ow.

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,350
I'm at my limit-- no sex,no coffee,charlotte's practice opening.

29
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,830
It's all too much to take.

30
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,860
"the premier physicians co-operative in los angeles"?

31
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,020
Not afraid of a little competition,are you?

32
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,530
Of coue.The source of all evil.

33
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,690
Free breakfast?

34
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,820
That's a little desperate,don't you think?

35
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,350
We like to treat our patients well.

36
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,860
We like to treat our patients with medicine,not break

37
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,010
************* they were all on the fourth floor.

38
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,810
Well,I own the building.

39
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,780
You're taking the sign down.

40
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,490
I'll move it outside.

41
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,030
Don't let her get to you.

42
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,840
I mean,really,who would be so stupid to fl for a free breakfast?

43
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,180
-we should've done this.
-Breakfast?

44
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,320
No,the floor.Expanded the practice.

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,550
We didn't have the money.

46
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,490
I hate money.

47
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,570
That's a novel attitude,and very healthy,therapeucally speaking.

48
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,660
Sheldon wallace,psychiatry.

49
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,060
-Sam bennett.
-Yeah,I recognize you from your book.

50
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,060
Great read.

51
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,780
I met one of your colleagues-- violet turner.

52
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,510
We shared a few elevator rides.

53
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,480
she's,um...

54
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,280
would it be okay if I inquired if she were...

55
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,350
-single?
-Why do you want to know?

56
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,760
She's single.

57
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,020
Well,that's good.

58
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,870
Really.

59
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,360
Good.

60
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,910
Well...

61
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,030
you shouldn't have told him she was single.

62
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,400
Are you jealous?

63
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,070
Sam,violet's one of our women.

64
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,050
They took our floor.

65
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,320
-They are not taking our women,too.
-You're jealous.

66
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,190
sorry.

67
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,560
My hotel just finished a $30-million remodel.

68
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,840
Super busy.

69
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay.

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,680
So...

71
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,220
it's just a cyst,right?

72
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,560
The pathology report,uh,showed that you have...

73
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,580
cancer cells on your left ovary.

74
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,330
Cancer?

75
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,450
And the cells we biopsied from your right ovary are cancerous,too.

76
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,730
I came in to get a cyst removed.

77
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:07,180
I'm sorry,but you have stage ii ovarian cancer.

78
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,160
Okay.

79
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,070
We treat it.

80
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,230
We get aggressive,right?

81
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,020
Exactly.

82
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,080
W what I'd like to do is schedule immediate surgery

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,810
and remove both your ovaries and your uterus.

84
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,000
No.

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,760
No.

86
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,440
No,I did everything right.

87
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,330
I waited until I made V.P.

88
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,100
I got child care written into my contract.

89
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,860
I have a nursery right off myffice.

90
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,090
I'm sorry,but there are other ways to make a family.

91
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,570
I want to have a baby myself.

92
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,390
I know that,but with ovarian cancer at this stage,

93
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,610
surgery is the only viable option.

94
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,570
You're a surgeon.

95
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,640
You think cutting is the answer to everything.

96
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,940
I want to save your life.

97
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,700
And I want a second opinion.

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,370
who's ray daniels?

103
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,100
Come on,sam,rocket ray?

104
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,820
The tour de france?Olympic gold medalist?You follow sports.

105
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,690
Yeah,football,basketball.

106
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,480
Riding a bike is not a sport.

107
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,420
Rocket's,like,the greatest ever.

108
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,930
He retired about five years ago.

109
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,130
He's making a bicomeback.

110
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,460
The so-cal 100's this week.

111
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,640
No way he's riding on that knee.

112
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,150
That must be why he's here.

113
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,300
Great.They have the best breakfast and the best patients.

114
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,510
Well,maybe we should,uh,introduce ourselves?

115
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,040
You mean try and poach him?

116
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,250
I'm not po--I wouldn't poach.

117
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,820
Poaching is unethical.

118
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,680
However,if something were to come up in conversation about alternatives...

119
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,500
what's in the box,cooper?

120
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,630
I'm getting rid of her...

121
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,150
it...

122
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,170
stuff.

123
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,730
I can't talk.I don't want to forget my speech.

124
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,970
Cooper,r-rage is not a healthy option.

125
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,290
Your nun's habit,the suede flogger,your pink wartenberg wheel,the cornstk...

126
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,910
Get out.

127
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,230
She means you.

128
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,720
thank you for returning my things.

129
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,560
Please leave.

130
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,740
I would like my things back.

131
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,980
Not gonna happen.

132
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,310
Spoils of war.

133
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,410
Leave now.

134
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,460
Looks like I've upset you,which I think is ir--

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,930
you all right?

136
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,120
It's a 24-hour bug.

137
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you for your sympathy.Get out.

138
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,100
you're pregnant.

139
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,650
don't be ridiculous.

140
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,680
Are your boobs tender?

141
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,710
-Are you having--
-go away,cooper!

142
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,800
Look,you've gotten rid of ever ahingbout me.Now go!

143
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,400
You need to take a pregnancy test.

144
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,630
I am not pregnant!Get out!

145
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,650
okay,there's the,uh,heartbeat,judy.

146
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,580
Heartbeat looks strong.That's good.

147
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,820
And I think...

148
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,870
it's a boy.

149
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,790
A boy,really?

150
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,710
-Yeah.
-Congratulations.

151
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,900
you're supposed to be supervising,not hovering.

152
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,300
I-I can do this on my own.

153
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,230
O-okay,all right.If you need me--

154
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,960
I've got it.

155
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,200
Wh's wrong?

156
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,500
nothing.Nothing.It's just...

157
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,260
I can't believe it.A boy.

158
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,540
It makes the whole thing more real.

159
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,030
Like,I could give him a name and--

160
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,460
relax.

161
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,530
Everything's looking good.

162
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,850
I'm falling behind in all of my classes.

163
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,300
I-I-I had to quit my job at the admissions office 'cause I'm too tired.

164
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,000
All I have is the financial aid.

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,470
How am I supsed to do this after the baby's born?

166
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,550
I want to go to law school.

167
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,390
You know,I want to have a life.

168
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,520
You will.

169
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,820
I'm not saying it won't be hard.

170
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,280
I'm not good at hard,dell.

171
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,650
I've been thinking a lot about adoption lately.

172
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,240
More than thinking,actually.

173
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,540
Dr. Lockhart from pacific wellcare would like the medical records for a leah hudley.

174
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,870
Why would he need her files?

175
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,560
She's his patient.

176
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,730
You really think you can have me race ready in two days?

177
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,370
We'll see.

178
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,390
There we go.

179
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,160
Hey,why don't you get up on that bike?

180
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,580
We'll see how the pain is,make a game plan,see where we go from here.

181
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,290
ray...

182
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,450
you're riding?

183
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,740
That was the idea.

184
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,540
That was your idea.

185
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,330
I didn't think they'd actually be able to help you.

186
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,220
He can't do this.

187
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,610
Monica,we've had this conversation.

188
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,620
Yeah,we actually think the pain is quite manageable.

189
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,830
-See,his knee seems to be res--
-it's not his knee.

190
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,740
It's his heart.

191
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,650
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

192
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,330
It's why he retired.

193
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,720
Wait,ray,you've been training for this comeback for months.

194
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,280
Because he thinks we need the money.

195
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,860
We're broke.We lost our house.I can't find a job.

196
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,050
I have to race.

197
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,390
I don't know how to do anything else.

198
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,820
Oa,ray.

199
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,050
You have to make him stop,because if you fix his knee,

200
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,910
he's gonna push himself to win.

201
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,020
And I'm afraid he's gonna die.

202
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,290
**************

203
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,990
********** That the walls of your heart are thickened,

204
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,860
and when you exercise intensely,you compromise the blood flow.

205
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,160
And if your heart doesn't get enough oxygen--

206
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,300
the doctor said this could've been there my whole life.

207
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,890
We admire what you're trying to do here,but monica's right.

208
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,580
The risk is too big for what might happen.

209
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,940
You came to me.

210
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,860
You wanted my business.

211
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,110
You told me you could fix my knee.

212
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,620
That's what I'm asking you to do,to be good doctors

213
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,350
and let me decide how to live my life.

214
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,620
Isn't that the way it works?

215
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,330
if you want to ply our patients with free coffee and breakfast,that's fine,

216
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,130
but selling them false hope is off-limits.

217
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,980
Montgomery.

218
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,390
Nice to see you.

219
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,210
Leah hudley has stage ii ovarian cancer,and she wants a by so badly,

220
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,980
she can't understand the gravity of her diagnosis.

221
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,360
And you've got wyatt lockhart promising her her life and a baby,

222
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,660
but without surgery or divine intervention,she is going to die.

223
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,700
Not divine intervention.

224
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,710
My intervention.

225
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,540
Montgomery,dr. Lockhart.

226
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,270
You know what's exciting,monty?

227
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,620
My protocol may single-handedly change the way that we treat ovarian cancer.

228
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,700
With a drug that's never been used on ovarian cancer?

229
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,870
I read your protocol.

230
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,570
There are serious side effects-- blood clots,heart failure,immune system--

231
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,620
each of which have occurred in a small percentage of patients.

232
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,990
You don't even know if this works.

233
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,110
So let's just cut out her entire reproductive system just to be safe.

234
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,850
Look,monty,it's the patient's choice.

235
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,740
Your way,no kids.

236
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,750
My way,she's got a chance.

237
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,300
There is a proven treatment to halt the cancer completely.

238
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,620
It's called surgery.

239
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,800
What you think is moot,montgomery,because leah hudley no longer wants you as her doctor.

240
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,470
She wants in on his trial.

241
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,690
It seems you make her sick.

242
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,170
you want to leave those files?

243
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,420
If leah hudley wants her files,she can come to me and get them.

244
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,010
You know,charlotte said you were brilliant.

245
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,720
She didn't say you were this hot.

246
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,120
I don't care who he is.

247
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,760
You have to talk him off the ledge.

248
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,990
Well,he wants what he wants.

249
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,900
Well,that's the athlete's mentality.

250
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,470
Their entire self-wort is wrapped up in winning.

251
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,340
That's why you have boxers who come out of retirement and end up with brain damage.

252
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,730
They--they don't know when to stop.

253
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,720
And since when do you care so much about cycling?

254
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,670
I mean,you don't even know how to ride a bike.

255
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,580
Naomi.

256
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,550
You don't know how to ride a bike?

257
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,290
That's--that's not the point.

258
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,090
The point is,he's gonna race,and if we don't fix his knee,

259
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,830
he's gonna find somebody else who will.

260
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,360
yeah,at least with us,we know.

261
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,290
We can give him his best shot at winning and surviving.

262
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,110
Arrogant,insufferable...

263
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,360
charlotte?

264
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,690
Wyatt lockhart.

265
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,200
He's working downstairs now.

266
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,040
And he tried to poach one of my patients.

267
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,540
Yeah,I mean,what kind a doctor does that,steals patients?

268
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,570
I mean,it's like he's some ambulance-chasing lawyer.

269
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,980
can I see everyone in the conference room?

270
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,620
I have an idea to help the practice.

271
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,250
Adoption.

272
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,640
Adoption agencies are nonprofit organizations,dell.

273
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,020
M not talking about an adoption agency.

274
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,050
I'm talking about a fee-based service matching up mothers

275
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,370
who already want to give their babies up for adoption with perspective parents.

276
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,450
We can help our patients already failing at fertility.

277
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,730
Offer them an in-house alternative to start a family.

278
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,880
Adoption isn't sometng you just offer when fertility fails.

279
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,310
If they haven't gin up on wanting a biological child,then they should not do it.

280
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,140
Which is why we'd have a strict protocol for that.

281
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,240
Violet's already licensed to screen birth mothers and perspective parents.

282
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,340
And once the child is born,cooper has a new patie.

283
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,870
All right,well,where do we findhe birth mothers

284
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,530
'cause I don't want us all out there recruiting.

285
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,580
We won't recruit.

286
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,870
All we need is one test case.

287
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,280
Where will we find this test case?

288
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,560
Actually,my patient-- my patient--judy wants to give her baby up for adoption and has asked for help.

289
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,580
And you've got a couple desperate to adopt,the sinclairs.

290
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,990
Yes,yes,I have screened the sinclairs,

291
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,370
but I haven't even met your patient.

292
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,610
I'll bring her in.You'll love her.

293
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,250
If we don't do this,someone else will,

294
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,740
maybe down on the fourth floor.

295
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,710
Is meg still out of town?

296
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,720
Yeah.Why?

297
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,700
A friend of mine offered me two tickets to the symphony.

298
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,070
Any interest in going?

299
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,470
You're not taking coop?

300
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,050
And listen to him moan about charlotte?

301
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,180
You know what?I would love to,but I shouldn'T.

302
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,770
I gotta study ray's condition.

303
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,850
Maybe I can do something to help his heart.

304
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,740
Alone again.

305
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,320
Hey,I know who you could ask.

306
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,390
you have a secret admirer.

307
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,780
Someone liking me is funny?

308
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,410
No,just the guy...

309
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,360
-this weird shrink from downstairs--
-sheldon?

310
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,500
Sheldon's interested in me?

311
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,080
You wouldn't go out with him?

312
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,730
He's from the fourth floor,the enemy.

313
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,970
You know how long it's been since I've had a date,pete?

314
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,040
charlotte.

315
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,490
You almost gave me a heart attack.

316
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,320
How you feeling?

317
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,040
I'm on the pill.

318
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,560
You're a doctor.You know that's not 100%.

319
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,220
Cooper,I would know if I was pregnant.

320
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,490
I am not pregnant.

321
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,730
-You're cranky.
-I'm always cranky.

322
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,590
You're glowing.

323
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,750
I'm always glowing.

324
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,140
Now please...

325
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,250
stop stalking me and my womb.

326
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,140
receive not one,but two-- ...

327
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,940
police of racism...

328
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,040
if I have to watch another episode of "cops," I'm gonna shoot your tv and my brains out.

329
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,650
Yeah,well,we wouldn't want to do that.

330
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,630
You'd ruin my 1,000-count sheets.

331
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,760
Can't you write me a doctor note,get me back out there?

332
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,060
You are on bed rest.

333
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,190
That means bed and rest.

334
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,550
come on.I have enough trouble with my patients not listening to me.

335
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,610
You...

336
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,360
are going to listen to me.

337
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,650
At'll get me through another day.

338
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,320
I'm suddenly nervous.

339
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,540
Naomi's just checking with the sinclairs and our lawyers.

340
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,570
I'm sure it'll all be good.

341
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,970
Yeah,but what about violet?

342
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,330
If she doesn't like me...

343
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,070
you'll be great,okay?

344
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,470
She just needs to know that you understand what you're doing,that you're comfortable with it.

345
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,900
Yeah,well,what do I say?

346
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,970
Uh,just tell her about your feelings and about the babyand your future.

347
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,950
Like what?

348
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,970
I mean,if i tell her the wrong thing--

349
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,240
tell her you've thought about this a lot,

350
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,820
that you know this is what you want to do,and that it'll be hard,

351
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,580
but what's best for the baby iswhat's most important for you.

352
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,750
Okay,that's great.That's great.What else?

353
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,940
Well,she'll ask if you've thought about how you might feel in a few years

354
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,970
if your situation improves and someone else is raising your child.

355
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,060
Well,how do I answer that?

356
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,320
Just,you know,say that it-- it would be hard,but...

357
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,230
you want this baby to have parents that can give it everything,

358
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,030
and you love him so much,you would never take that away.

359
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,170
It's a mother's sacrifice.

360
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,660
you ready,judy?

361
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,260
Um,yeah.

362
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,230
I'm--I'm ready.

363
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,780
Okay.

364
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,540
You should've given them my file.

365
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,710
I was worried about you.

366
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,770
You didn't return my calls.

367
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,740
I'm choosing to go elsewhere,dr. Montgomery.

368
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,530
That's my right.

369
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,560
-I just want to be sure--
-I didn't plan for the perfect dress,

370
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,750
the perfect ring,the perfect wedding.

371
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,210
I planned for this.

372
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,330
This is all I've wanted.

373
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:12,810
I set up my career for this,to be able to be a single mom who can provide for a baby.

374
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:17,570
It may not be conventional,and it may not be the easy way,

375
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,940
but it's the way i wanted.

376
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,760
it's what I planned for.

377
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,320
And with dr. Lockhart,I have shot.

378
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,750
-Can you offer me that?
-I can get rid of theancer.

379
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,750
So can he.

380
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,410
And i need both.

381
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,230
I hope it works for you,leah.

382
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,790
I really do.

383
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,910
Thank you.

384
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,630
Hey,sheldon.

385
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,580
Oh,I'm sorry.

386
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,460
Oh,I'm so sorry.

387
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,670
No,no,,that was me.

388
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,290
I'm glad to see you,viet.

389
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,890
our little breakfast buffet seems to be quiet popular with the fifth floor.

390
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,560
Um,clinically speaking,do you think that's,uh,envy or the lobster?

391
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,190
My diagnosis is more...

392
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,260
curiosity and the smoked salmon.

393
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,510
Would you go out with me?

394
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,590
I'm sorry.That was meant to have charm and buildup and a clever turn of phrase.

395
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,150
I'd love to.

396
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,990
Really?

397
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,390
I'm not sure we can go through this again.

398
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,610
We've found two birth mothers.

399
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,660
Last time,I'd even picked out birth announcements.

400
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,480
They had these...

401
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,920
stupid little turtles on 'em.

402
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,190
We spent months getting our hopes up,and we never even got to meet the baby.

403
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,630
The father has already signed-off on the adoption,

404
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,100
and--and violet has interviewed the birth mother.

405
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,250
I'm very impressed by her maturity.

406
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,300
She really thinks adoption is the best thing for her baby.

407
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,630
I think this time will be different.

408
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,200
Okay.

409
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,800
Uh,matt,carrie...

410
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,390
th is judy.

411
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,230
Um,dell says that you're both lawyers.

412
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,340
Uh,yes,but don't hold that against us.

413
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,700
why don't we give you a chance to talk?

414
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,720
Thanks.

415
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,040
this may work.

416
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,190
-Nicjob,dell.
-so are you in school?

417
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,070
Yes.

418
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,930
Uh,yes,I'm in my third year right now.

419
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,750
Oh,that's great.Congratulations.

420
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,630
Thanks.

421
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,200
Sorry.

422
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,290
I was grabbing something for ray.

423
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,760
Are you okay?

424
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,310
No.

425
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,020
leah hudley wouldn't listen.

426
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,640
She's sticking with lockhart.

427
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,570
I don't mind ling a patient to a doctor,but when someone steals a patient by giving them false hope...

428
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,240
that's despicae.

429
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,400
hey,man,10 miles on the bike,no pain.

430
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Heart's looking good.

431
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,150
Wish me luck tomorrow.

432
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,230
Don't race,ray.

433
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,540
I'm gonna win.

434
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm gonna get monica the money we need,and I'm gonna be fine.

435
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,730
You fixed me.

436
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,150
look,I'm not the enemy.

437
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,350
The patient chose me.That happens.

438
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,640
Let me buy you dinner.

439
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,230
Anywhere you want to go,my treat.

440
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,510
Or we could just skip dinner and go to my place.

441
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,030
unbelievable.

442
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,910
What?I'm trying to be nice,monty.

443
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,300
It's montgomery.

444
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,690
offer stands.

445
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,230
Dinner on me,anytime.

446
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,090
Oh,good.

447
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,420
I'm glad you're still here.

448
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,590
I just wanted to say thank you so much for all that you've done.

449
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,350
I'm,uh,I'm pretty surethey're the ones.

450
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,830
I'm so happy for all of you.

451
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,490
Oh,um,and we met with the adoption lawyer today.

452
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,210
They've offered to pick up all of my living expenses until the baby is born.

453
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:30,920
Wow.

454
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,370
That's amazing.I mean,that should make things easier,right?

455
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,870
like I told you,I am not good at hard.

456
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,970
I just feel like I can breathe again,you know?

457
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,850
Like I can do this.

458
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:46,310
I can do school,I can have this baby,and then after that,who knows?

459
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,630
-What do you mean?
-I don't know.

460
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,340
I don't know.

461
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,010
I just know that the weight of all this freaked me out.

462
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,110
I really thought I couldn't have this baby,but now...

463
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,270
what?

464
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,430
Well,violet says I n change my mind legally right up until the end.

465
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,200
Yeah,I-I know,but you said you were sure.

466
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Stop worrying,dell.

467
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,350
I'm not saying I won'T.

468
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,320
I just...

469
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,590
I can'stop thinking of baby names.

470
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,390
" What are you doing?

471
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,750
-I'm going to work.
-Now?

472
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,020
I'm a cop.

473
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,820
We're open all night.

474
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,900
Kevin,kevin,you can'T.

475
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,710
Ur wounds need time to heal.

476
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,960
Come on.Let's go back to bed.

477
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,240
You're not my doctor,addison.

478
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,990
Do you think that I like keeping you here, kevin?

479
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,750
I mean, do you think that I like playing doctor to you when you won't listen,

480
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,830
when you behave the way all my other patients who think they know better

481
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,960
than I do about what's best for them?

482
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,370
I am a doctor.
I know what's best for you.

483
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,050
I know better than you,

484
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,790
and I'm not gonna stand here and watch you be stupid

485
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,910
and hurt yourself because you're bored.

486
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,190
m going for a walk.

487
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,330
the patient says "I understand the psychology behind the joke.

488
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,270
I just don't think it's funny."

489
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,220
so...

490
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,450
I had a great time tonight, violet.

491
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,450
We'll--we'll have to do it again soon.

492
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,000
- Wow.
- Yeah.

493
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,650
It's okay.

494
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,840
Really.
It happens.

495
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,530
if anybody knows that it could happen, we know.

496
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,470
We know.

497
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,750
It's not because I don't want to, because I want to.I do.

498
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,790
It's just...

499
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,210
well, it didn't happen.

500
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,070
Would you like to talk about it?

501
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,360
I mean...

502
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,320
would you...

503
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,280
how does it make you feel?

504
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,850
I think I should probably go, violet.

505
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,940
Your paranoia's contagious.
Let's get this done.

506
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,340
I have sticks, and I intend to pee on them.

507
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,960
And if your boys swam through my weeds and got me pregnant,

508
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,190
I am gonna make yosuffer every step of the way.

509
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,090
what do you have to help with erections?

510
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,110
Okay.
Now I'm humiliated.

511
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,560
Are we talking about sheldon?

512
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,750
- Bad date?
- Worse.

513
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,170
It was a great date.

514
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,180
Followed by foreplay, followed by A...

515
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,770
distinct lack of movement.

516
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,290
Maybe the guy just doesn't find me attractive.

517
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,720
Violet, any guy would be lucky to have you.

518
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,710
Thanks, pete.

519
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,570
That was, uh...

520
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,050
nice.

521
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,800
Weird to be talking abou my sex life with you, but, um, but--but nice.

522
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,750
Here.

523
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,270
Give him this.

524
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,090
Secret recipe.

525
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,830
See?That's what I like about you.

526
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,600
It's a concrete answer to a question.

527
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,920
Somebody asks for something, and you just give it to 'em.

528
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,980
Didn't you yell at me about that yesterday?

529
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,650
Rocket ray, giving him what he wants?

530
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,450
You actually listened?

531
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,280
here.

532
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,750
I didn't sleep last night thinking about ray and the race.

533
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,440
I don't get it.Why are they being monitored like that?

534
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,830
It's telemetry to help the coaches give advice during the race.

535
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,690
It clocks the use of energy so they'll know when to push,

536
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,690
they know when to pull back.

537
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,630
Since the tour de france, they've been putting it on the web.

538
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,680
- He looks okay.
- Yeah, now.

539
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,930
But the race just started.

540
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,650
I'm afraid I'm pushing too hard,

541
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,640
you know, stealing patients, promising them the world.

542
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,530
Wait, you...

543
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,030
you stole ray daniels from downstairs?

544
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,420
Yeah.

545
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,430
- It's lousy, isn't it?
- Yeah.

546
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,050
And kinda great.

547
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,630
all right.Okay.
I get your point.

548
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,050
When people want what they want...

549
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,220
hope it works out.

550
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,890
Think of waterfalls.

551
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,910
- It always worked for me.
- Stop talking.

552
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,480
I can't pee while you're talking.

553
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,710
This is how it all begins.

554
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,740
- What?
- Parenthood.

555
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,610
stop it.

556
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,470
Us with a little kid?
that's insane.

557
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,270
It's not that insane.
I'm a pediatrician.

558
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,240
We're broken up.

559
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,340
mission accomplished.

560
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,710
Now all we have to do is wait.

561
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,040
come on.

562
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,140
Little walter?

563
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,650
are you trying to be funny?

564
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,250
No, that was my grandfather.
He was a piano tuner.

565
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,780
Maybe he'll play an instrument, maybe the trumpet.

566
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,580
Please.
It'll be a girl.

567
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,150
- Marjorie.
- Your grandmother?

568
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,540
my horse.

569
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,840
Last animal I ever had.
I was 15.

570
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,840
She broke her ane.
I had to shoot her.

571
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,810
we're not talking about a pet.
We're talking about a child.

572
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,830
If it's a girl, marjorie is great.

573
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,400
Maybe this is a really good thing, charlotte.

574
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:10,350
Babies bring good luck, happiness.

575
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,900
Fate intervenes and pulls us back together.

576
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,490
time.

577
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,130
Oh.All right.walter.

578
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,780
Marjorie.

579
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:38,200
that's, uh...
that.

580
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,080
When you talked to judy yesterday, did anything...

581
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,380
- everything checked out?
- Is there a problem?

582
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,450
Do you think I rushed things?

583
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,030
Like, maybe we should've looked a little harder

584
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,030
to find a better candidate for the adoption program.

585
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,900
This is important to you.

586
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,820
I just want to prove to everyone--

587
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,450
to naomi--that I can pull my own weight around here.

588
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,310
You're doing a great job, dell.

589
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,560
You were right about judy.

590
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,980
She's thought a lot about this.

591
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,060
She knows what she wants.
She knows what she's doing.

592
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,690
What's best for the baby is what's most important for her,

593
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,770
and down the line, even if she has regrets,

594
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,470
she knows she could never take away from this baby what she's given it.

595
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,120
She knows it's a sacrifice.

596
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,830
- She said those things?
- She did.

597
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,960
Look, I know you're nervous, but don't second guess yourself.

598
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,910
She's great.

599
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,470
The anti-angiogenesis agent caused a perforation in leah's descending colon.

600
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,790
- She needs surgery now.
- What about lockhart?

601
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,840
He's not a surgeon, addison.
She needs you.

602
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,140
You are not allowed in my O.R.

603
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,350
This is my cancer case.
If i want to observe, I'll observe.

604
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,300
You know, your cancer case is leah hudley.

605
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,930
You really should know the name of your guinea pigs before you try to kill them.

606
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,010
You're a fetal surgeon.
It's not like you don't take risks.

607
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,050
What's your problem with me?

608
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,920
I take risks when there are no other options.

609
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,510
I take risks when it's forthe good of my patients.

610
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,960
And leah hudley wanted to take a risk.

611
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,300
Yeah, she gambled, but she gambled so she could have children.

612
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,700
She is so desperate to have a child,

613
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,010
and you used that as a carrot to get her to enlist in your clinical trial.

614
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,650
A clinal trial that could save her.

615
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,390
I'm sorry.

616
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:35,100
I just wanted to have a baby so badly.

617
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,110
- Plse help me.
- We will.

618
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,910
Hang another unit of blood, now.

619
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,090
We can't infuse as fast as she's bleeding.You need to control it.

620
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,360
I know.
I'm trying to find the source.

621
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,990
The bleeding is obscthing e field.

622
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,110
Hat are you doing?

623
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,630
I'm making sure you don't kill her.

624
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,050
You're scared you screwed up.

625
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,460
There, the bleeding is coming from the I.M.A.

626
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,090
I know.
I need A...

627
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,700
all right.

628
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,800
run your finger on the uterine wall.

629
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,420
- Why?
- The tumor.I think it's gone.

630
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,940
I don't feel anything.
We'll do a tissue biopsy.

631
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,860
And it'll show my protocol was working.

632
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,470
you ever feel like you're in way over your head?

633
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,060
Have you met me?

634
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,470
I'm the king of in over my head.

635
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,990
It's the adoption thing?

636
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,710
What happens if she changes her mind?

637
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,180
You know I was adopted, right?

638
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,780
My birth mother, she never wanted kids,

639
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,040
and then the day I was born, she wavered.

640
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,800
She held me in her arms, and she couldn't give me up.

641
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,490
What changed her mind?

642
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,250
You know, as cute as I was, and I was...

643
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,980
- I was cute...
- yeah.

644
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,860
She realized what was best for me.

645
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,970
Sometimes you have to let people waver

646
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,320
so they can figure o what's real and what's not.

647
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,530
Your parents are lucky she made the right choice.

648
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,430
I'd hate to think where I'd be if she hadn'T.

649
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,540
- How's ray doing?
- hey.It's the last mile.

650
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,080
His heart's doing okay.

651
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,810
He's in second place, ct he's tlosinghe gap.

652
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,600
- He could actually win.
- I know.

653
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,320
Cycling's exciting.

654
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,360
Well, maybe you should turn over a new leaf, learn how to ride.

655
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,930
You really never learned?

656
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,130
What, were you locked in a cage?

657
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,670
My mama didn't want me to get hurt, okay?

658
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,610
and then I got older, and I j--

659
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,720
you better stop lookin' at me like that.

660
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,620
A lot of peopl don't know how to ride.

661
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,740
Oh, he--he took the lead.

662
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,050
- Yeah, just like that.
- Ha!

663
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,340
- Biking, man.
- He is winning this.

664
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,570
He is.
He's gonna do this.

665
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,060
- he won!
- We won!We won!

666
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,760
We did it!
oh, we did it!
That knee, man.

667
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,900
- All right!
- He did that.

668
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,880
Sam.Sam.

669
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,430
Oh, crap.
He's in fib.

670
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,910
Vitals are normal.

671
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,470
Everything's right on track.

672
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,620
Thank you for helping me

673
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,730
- after what I did.
- You made a choice.

674
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,700
Doctors disagree.
It's not your fault.

675
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,820
Dr. Lockhart said the biopsy showed the tumor's shrinking.

676
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,250
Yes.

677
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,180
So when you get better, will you continue?

678
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,290
I know I wanted a baby.

679
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,890
But I don't want to die.

680
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,570
Can you still do the surgery?

681
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,380
We are going to kick this cancer in the ass.

682
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,910
We'll beat it, leah.

683
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:16,370
And then we'll figure out a way foyou to have your family.

684
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,110
How's she doing?

685
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,240
She's stable.
Still in a lot of pain.

686
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,190
I hear the cancer's shrinking.

687
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,930
I still think he's a reckless son of a bitch.

688
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,620
And what--what ockdid you find him under?

689
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,500
He's good for business, montgomery.

690
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,600
- I don't have to like him.
- Oh, you don't like him?

691
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,770
He's out for glory, he's arrogant, and I don't trust him.

692
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,340
Sounds like someone who mightuse insider information

693
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,410
from their boyfriend to start their own practice.

694
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,990
I guess you two are made for each other.

695
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,000
Charlotte, what...

696
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,270
I'm fine.

697
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,360
I'm fine.

698
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,870
Uh, it's just A...

699
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,840
long day.

700
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,780
Did you want to, um...

701
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,810
- talk?
- No.

702
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,520
no, I don't want to talk.

703
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,230
- Okay.
- Okay.

704
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,670
- ray daniels.
- Where is he?

705
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,050
Rocket ray, the cyclist, we need to see him.

706
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,700
He's in the morgue.

707
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,160
Did we kill him?

708
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,930
He was gonna race with us or without us.

709
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,700
But we helped make tt happen.
We stole a patient.

710
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,600
We helped him push too hard, and he's dead.

711
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,190
Ray pushed himself, pete.

712
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,530
Now maybe...

713
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,680
maybe we got caught up in this charlotte thing, but...

714
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,270
- he begged us for our help.
- I know.

715
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,640
I'm just afraid we didn't do it for ray.

716
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,350
We did it for us or for the practice...

717
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,490
to prove that we're...

718
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,180
better than a catered breakfast.

719
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:26,360
Oh, uh, naomi?
Nai, I need to talk to you.

720
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,680
What, a-about my hovering?

721
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,530
Because I'm going to try and give you some space

722
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,970
now that you are our adoption guru.

723
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:34,020
Naomi, look, I-I wanted to prove to you that I could do things on my own.

724
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,980
And you have.
I get it.I get it.

725
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,070
All I have to do is look in that ro and see what you've done.

726
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,020
You made a family, dell.

727
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,590
You took these people who had gone through so much, and...

728
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,500
now they have hope again.

729
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,640
They're gonna have a baby.

730
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,320
I'm proud of you.

731
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,560
Thank you.

732
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:08,630
turns out it was the lobster in the breakfastuffet that made me sick,

733
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,290
and a whole host of patients who won't be coming back.

734
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,850
It was nice spending time with you this mornG.

735
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,750
This morning, I thought you were pregnant.

736
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:21,640
You know, don't make that something it wasn'T.

737
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,610
I should've told you about the fourth floor.I know--

738
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,810
I got caught up this morning

739
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,600
in something that makes no sense at all

740
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,860
with someone

741
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,260
who doesn't want what I want

742
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,400
or behave the way I think normal hu-human beings should behave.

743
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,870
Don't mistake that for forgiveness.

744
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,040
Well...

745
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,810
I guess it...

746
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,690
worked out well all around.

747
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,390
was today as good for you as it was for me?

748
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,930
Which part, when you almost killed my patient,

749
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,710
or when you got in my way while I operated?

750
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,670
We have different agendas.

751
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,720
You're trying to save one life.
I'm working to save thousands.

752
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,990
And I just kept your funding alive

753
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,590
by keeping a fatality from screwing up your trial data.

754
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,250
And you saved her life.

755
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,700
I like you Mont y.

756
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,650
let me take you out to dinner to show you I'm grateful

757
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,860
and I'm not as bad as you think.

758
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,920
I'll take your word for it.

759
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,850
Oh, and if you call me monty again,

760
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:37,350
I'm going to plunge a scalpel through your hand.

761
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,660
you, uh, left me a message?

762
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,540
Come in, sheldon.

763
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,510
I won't bite.

764
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,370
I was surprised you called, you know, after--

765
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,110
I want to go out again.

766
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,320
I'm not, um...

767
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,220
I'm not big into potions, but, um,

768
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,570
someone I know swears that, um...

769
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,960
that this will do the trick.

770
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,780
Violet, I'm astounded that you called and flattered.But...

771
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,330
that's not gonna help.

772
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,610
No, I'm--I'm a good shrink.

773
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,000
I know what the problem is.

774
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,830
I pushed too hard?

775
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,070
No, no.
It's not you at all.

776
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:31,400
Or--or it is, but I-I-it'S...

777
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,600
look...

778
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,970
you're outta my league.

779
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,190
sheldon.

780
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,330
No, no, I've never been with soone so smart or funny or beautiful before.

781
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,990
I mean, y-you're gorgeous,

782
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,410
and it makes me feel inadequate, which leads to my problem,

783
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,290
which makes me feel even more inadequate and leads to even more...

784
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,370
difficulty.

785
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:57,020
and w-whatever's in that little bottle is not gonna make you less beautiful.

786
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,310
I like you, violet.

787
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,220
You think maybe...

788
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,300
we could be friends?

789
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,960
- how was work?
- This is as far as I got.

790
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,310
You've been sitting here all day?

791
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:32,890
Yeah, yeah.My ass fell asleep two hours ago.

792
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,510
it's not funny.

793
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,220
okay.

794
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,620
Maybe it's a little funny.

795
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,670
and stupid.

796
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,650
you can say I told you so and whatever else you want.

797
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,610
I deserve it.
I should've listened to you.

798
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,140
No.
Why listen to me?

799
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,790
I'm not your doctor.

800
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,640
No, you're my girlfriend,

801
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,750
who has gone way past the limit of what anyone would do,

802
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:02,340
and I'm not sure that I've said thank you.

803
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,130
Oh, why do patients always have to figure out things the hard way?

804
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,760
okay.
Okay, I'm ready.

805
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,330
Okay, go.

806
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,700
Okay, you won't let go until I say, right?

807
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,970
I-I am holding on, sam.
Pedal.Go.

808
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,970
You won't let go until is say--

809
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,810
go, sam.Go.
Go, go, go.

810
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,120
- Here I go.
- come on.

811
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,440
- Here I go.
- All right.

812
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,700
Okay.

813
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,090
- Stop laughing.
- Go, go, go.

814
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,180
- You got it.
- Stop lauinG.

815
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,700
Go, go, go.
Go, go.

816
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,100
- Hey.
- Oh, you're doing it.

817
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,390
You're doing it!
yes!

818
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,900
oh, god!

819
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,790
Sam?
Okay.Okay.

820
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,840
I heard about what happened on the race.

821
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,540
I'm so sorry.

822
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,010
Yeah, me, too.

823
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,660
How come you're not on your date...

824
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,960
using the potion?

825
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,180
He didn't want to go out again.

826
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,040
Oh, it's his loss.

827
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,790
No.

828
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:34,040
It's my loss.

829
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,100
You know, celibacy is a sign of strength.

830
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,830
But I'm so lonely, pete.

831
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,720
So am I.

832
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,650
Like...

833
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,400
like bottom-of-my-soul lonely.

834
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,670
So am I.
