1
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:19,935
You left your panties
at my house this morning.

2
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:23,266
I was looking for these.

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,604
You came to work
with npanties?

4
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:27,897
(charlotte) is she back?

5
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:30,436
I-is who what?
Violet.

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,440
She's been gone two weeks.
I killed all her houseplants.

7
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:35,698
Is she back?
No, not yet.

8
00:00:35,722 --> 00:00:38,876
She's...
Awfully into violet.

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,879
No, she's not.

10
00:00:39,903 --> 00:00:41,272
It's just that cooper's
on vacation with violet.

11
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:43,683
And she can't admit
that she misses cooper, so...

12
00:00:46,153 --> 00:00:47,361
What are you doing?

13
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:49,763
I'm waiting for sam.
I'm gonna make him talk to me.

14
00:00:49,787 --> 00:00:51,905
Make him?
Mm-hmm. For the past
couple of weeks,

15
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:53,759
He's been avoiding
the office altogether,

16
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:55,135
Booking surgery after surgery.

17
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,554
Well... Today we have
a patient together,

18
00:00:57,578 --> 00:01:00,306
And he is
going to talk to me.
I know you don't want to hear me
say this again, but--

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,558
No, he has no right
to be mad at me, pete.
He has a right to be mad.

20
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:04,784
You told him
you couldn't be with him

21
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:07,733
And you started sleeping
with me.
But you are not the ex-husband
of my best friend.

22
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:09,426
Look, you know,
it irritates me.

23
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,483
I mean, doesn't it irritate you
that violet went away?

24
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:15,329
She's not with some guy.
She's with, uh, cooper,

25
00:01:15,353 --> 00:01:17,718
And they--they're touching
monkeys, whatever they call it.

26
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:19,580
Anyway,
she's coming back today, so--

27
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,516
Good morning, sam.

28
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,391
Morning, addison, pete.
How are you?

29
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:28,396
Good. How are you?

30
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,187
Uh, I am great.

31
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:32,620
Well, good. That's...
That's good.

32
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:35,392
Okay.
Good to see you, pete.

33
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:37,853
What just happened?

34
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:39,309
He talked to you.

35
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,440
Um, I have 15 minutes
before my first patient.

36
00:01:42,464 --> 00:01:44,353
(lowered voice)
take those panties off.

37
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:45,610
But he just talked to me.

38
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:47,503
Panties off now.

39
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:52,967
Welcome to flight 120,
pacific vista airlines,

40
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:55,238
Nonstop service
to san francisco.

41
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:57,680
Please turn your attention to
the flight attendant nearest you

42
00:01:57,704 --> 00:02:00,801
For our fety demonstration...
We could close
the window shade if you like.

43
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:02,671
I mean, if--
if it bothers you.
Leave it open.

44
00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:06,532
Violet says it's good
not to close anything out.

45
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:09,614
(woman) please prepare
for gate departure...
She lets her patients
call her violet, huh?

46
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:11,410
Well, she said anybody
who survived what I survived

47
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:13,729
Gets to call her
by her first name.
(chuckles) okay.

48
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:17,560
(woman)
to release your seat belt,

49
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:19,470
Lift the upper portion
of the buce.

50
00:02:19,494 --> 00:02:22,018
We suggest that you keep
your seat belt fastened

51
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,979
Throughout the flight, as we may
experience turbulence...

52
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:25,918
If you could just, uh,
a ttle less squeezing.

53
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:27,817
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

54
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:29,839
Thank you for doing this.

55
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:31,260
If my sister
wasn't getting married,

56
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,884
I would've waited for violet.
It's my pleasure.

57
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:48,121
Good, good. Just breathe.
You can do this.

58
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:50,510
Yeah. I can do this.

59
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,657
Now just find
your place of calm.

60
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:00,194
You know, think about
san francisco,

61
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:03,141
About the wedding,
your--your family.

62
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,791
Slow down, all right?

63
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:10,017
I made a mistake.

64
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,710
I can't do this. I can't.
You can. You can.
Just try and ground yourself.

65
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,596
Now--
stop the plane!
I have to get off.

66
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,912
You need to sit back down.
We've already left the gate.
No, we're gonna crash!

67
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:20,049
we're gonna crash,
and ople are gonna burn.

68
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:22,314
She was on the flight 97 crash
last year.

69
00:03:25,026 --> 00:03:26,502
it's okay. Natasha...

70
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:30,758
Natasha!
No. Let me off this plane!
Let me off this plane!

71
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,424
Ma'am, please!
No, we're gonna crash!

72
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,486
Ma'am, it's okay!
You better
let her off this plane!

73
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:43,578
Alvin ailey dance theater.

74
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:46,161
No one can get tickets
to that.
I can.

75
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,064
William.

76
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:49,342
You know, the dinners
and the flowers

77
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:51,275
And the gifts...

78
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,957
Are you just trying to...
Get me into bed?

79
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:56,809
Because I am a grown woman.

80
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,643
You can ask.
I'm very aware
of your womanhood.

81
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:02,048
And I will ask
at some point.

82
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:05,034
Right now, however,
I'm--I'm wooing you.

83
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:06,160
You are.

84
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:08,727
Pick you up tomorrow night
about 7:00, here?

85
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:10,494
Okay. 7:00.

86
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:20,844
Such a pretty picture--

87
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:24,034
The rich dirty old boss
and his hot employee.
Do you actually
want something

88
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:27,040
Or do you just enjoy
tormenting me?
There's a very sweet-looking
couple

89
00:04:27,064 --> 00:04:28,533
Who can't keep their hands
off each other

90
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:31,359
Waiting for you
in the lobby.
Oh, okay. Thanks.

91
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:37,103
Is there something else?

92
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:38,895
You actually like that guy?

93
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:40,894
I actually like that guy.

94
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:44,793
I don't ever wt to see
a book again.

95
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,429
it wasn't that bad.

96
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,582
For you.

97
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:50,727
This is the kind of guy
who gets a's without studying.

98
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:52,281
It's disgusting.

99
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:55,531
Hey, elisha and esau.
How's the happy couple?

100
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:57,110
Did you guys finish
your dissertations?

101
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:59,179
Yeah, we argued 'em
last week.

102
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:01,347
The committee loved his.
They liked mine.

103
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:03,110
I should be jealous,
but I don't care.

104
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:06,399
We're done with school
and we're off to vegas tomorrow.
Oh, vegas wedding, huh?

105
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,689
We want elvis to marry us.
Elvis?

106
00:05:10,713 --> 00:05:13,721
Esau loves elvis.
Yes, it's--
it's elvis, vegas.

107
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:16,135
It's the ultimate
american wedding.

108
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,200
right.

109
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:22,091
Okay, it looks like we can't get
you that physical soon enough.

110
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:23,311
Did you bring the form?

111
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:25,728
Yes, I got it right here.
Excellent.

112
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:27,242
My visa has expired.

113
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:29,780
I need a physical to apply
for a green card.

114
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:32,134
Okay, you ready?
Yeah.

115
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:37,918
All right, baby's full term.
Could deliver at any time.

116
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:39,631
Has there been
any change with his heart?

117
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:42,688
Well, the doppler shows
no change in the anatomy.

118
00:05:42,712 --> 00:05:46,285
There's transposition
of the great vessels.
You'll schedule
the heart surgery?

119
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:48,936
How soon?
Well, I'll do the first one
within a week of delivery.

120
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,343
And then we can figure out
the rest of the schedule

121
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:52,670
As the baby grows.

122
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,545
let's just hope
the baby has your lungs, yeah?

123
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:05,241
Yeah.
All right, let's get you
into that physal,

124
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,728
Check out that cough.

125
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:11,346
You're back.

126
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,601
It's about time...

127
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,040
Not quite
who you were looking for?

128
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:17,976
What are you doing in here?
I'm updating the notes
one of violet's patients.

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,687
Plane crash survivor getting
over her fear of flying...

130
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:21,761
Until she had a meltdown

131
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:24,354
And was completely
re-traumatized under my care.

132
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:26,576
Like house-sitting for a friend
and killing their dog?

133
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,179
Thank you. That--
that makes me feel better.
She's not back yet.

134
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:32,981
who does that?

135
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:35,062
Drops everything on a moment's
notice and disappears?

136
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:36,572
We're really
talking about cooper.

137
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,929
No.

138
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:41,176
I was under the impression
that you'd broken up.
We have.

139
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,220
We were doing just fine
hating each other

140
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,398
Till maya's wedding.

141
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:46,934
He followed me
into the bathroom.

142
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:47,946
Long story.

143
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,673
Well, maybe after
the long story,

144
00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:52,082
Cooper's just trying
to figure things out.

145
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:53,662
Maybe he's just an ass.

146
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,449
So... This is the guy.

147
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm the guy.
You know, I'd given up
on meeting someone.

148
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:06,390
That's why we harvested my eggs,
but then... bam.

149
00:07:06,414 --> 00:07:08,322
Like a lilac bulb

150
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,864
Bursting through
the winter snow--

151
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,047
Outta nowhere.
henry sells rare
peruvian lily seedlings online.

152
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:14,108
That's how we met.

153
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,867
I googled all around,
but he was the only one

154
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:19,209
That would
ship them overnight.
Not many people understand
the differences in lilies.

155
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:23,007
Not the way may does.
It's fate.
We're like henry and June.

156
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:24,799
But one month off.

157
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,367
Don't make me laugh.
It hurts when I laugh.

158
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:31,715
Okay, what hurts?
He flew all the way over here
to meet me,

159
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,739
So we could see
if we both lived up

160
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:36,319
To the e-mails and the pictures
and the phone calls.

161
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:38,646
And we did. You did,enry.

162
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,574
I thought I was
being gentle, but--
last night
was our first time.

163
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:45,196
Mm-hmm.
I have never had
so much pain.

164
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,660
I feel like I'm...
On fire.

165
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:51,880
Okay. All right. Okay. Well,
we will--we will take a look.

166
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:55,275
And, uh, we'll get you back
on your feet, so to speak.
Okay.

167
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:02,294
So, um...

168
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:03,905
We're good?

169
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:07,224
Yeah, we are good.
No, no, no. I mean
about me and pete.

170
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:08,527
Yeah, yeah.
I know what you mean.

171
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:11,117
Be-because I want to make sure
you know that it's different.

172
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:13,057
Me and pete is different
than me and you

173
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:15,542
Because you were married
to naomi,

174
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:18,303
And she's my best friend.
Addison, I don't have to
talk about this.

175
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:19,718
It's water under the bridge.

176
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:21,988
Pete, glad you're here.
Take a look at this?

177
00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:24,236
Esau's got an infiltrate
on his lung

178
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,348
And a pleural effusion.

179
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,355
I think I'm gonna need
a consult.

180
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,678
You needed a consult
and you called pete?

181
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:32,837
He did... Call me.

182
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:35,314
All right, people, I'm good.
All right?

183
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:37,657
I don't think this is.

184
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,691
Right there.

185
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:45,129
What's going on?
This is dr. Wilder.

186
00:08:45,153 --> 00:08:46,723
He's a specialist
in infectious diseases.

187
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:50,292
I'd like you both
to put these on, please.
Elisha, if you could just come
over to this side of the room,

188
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:52,842
Just for a moment.
You're scaring me.
What's wrong?

189
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:57,384
Esau has tuberculosis.
What? No, no, no. Other than
the cough, I-I feel fine.

190
00:08:57,408 --> 00:09:00,805
I feel fine.
T.B. Doesn't always manifest
with anything more than a cough.

191
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:03,453
But it's serious.
No one gets t.B. Anymore.

192
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,708
Not here much,
but it's on the rise

193
00:09:05,732 --> 00:09:08,466
In other parts of the world.
What--what about elisha
and the baby?

194
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,821
What if they get it?
We can test her.

195
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:13,038
If she's positive,
we can go ahead and treat her.
The mask should protect her,

196
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:14,395
But in the meantime,
I'd like sam

197
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:16,234
To check you into st. Ambrose,
run some tests,

198
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:17,362
Find out what strain you have

199
00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:21,556
And get you started
on antibiotics.
Wait, I--if immigration
finds out I have t.B.,

200
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,879
What about my green card?

201
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:26,606
I need you to sign off on
my physical, to say I'm okay.
Esau...

202
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,215
No, his visa's expired.

203
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:32,890
If you don't send that form in,
they'll send him away.

204
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:35,980
Dr. Bennett, please.

205
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:48,698
Okay. So the nurses
are finishing up on him.

206
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,321
Uh, then you can go in.

207
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:51,806
I put him on antibiotics

208
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,286
And took some cultures
to verify the strain.

209
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,875
And what about the form,
dr. Bennett?

210
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,914
I have a legal obligation
to turn that form in,

211
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:03,226
And I-I can't lie on it.
But he's gonna get deported.
We're supposed to be married.

212
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,294
I'm gonna have his baby
in a few weeks.

213
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:07,620
Can you hold off
on sending the form in?
I don't feel comfortable

214
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:09,232
Withholding information
from the government.

215
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:14,110
If he doesn't have that form,
he illegal and he can't work

216
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:15,963
And he could be deported
at any time.

217
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,991
I...

218
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:21,391
Okay, okay, um...

219
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:25,628
W-we'll just go live
with his--his parents in kenya.

220
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:27,589
Elisha, uh...

221
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:29,657
You can't leave the country.

222
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:32,600
If he's going,
I'm going with him.
He's talking about the baby.

223
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:34,012
He needs surgeries

224
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:36,533
And extensive care
for the next few years.

225
00:10:36,557 --> 00:10:39,541
You won't have access to
the care that he needs in kenya.

226
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:47,537
I'll hold off
on--on sending in the forms.

227
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:48,684
We'll get him treated

228
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:53,087
And we'll worry
about immigration later.
Thank you.

229
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,164
Thank you.
Okay.

230
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:58,115
Okay.
Okay.

231
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:03,988
Thank you, sam.
Yeah.

232
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:08,788
hey, you.

233
00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:10,849
I thought you were
at your offi today.

234
00:11:10,873 --> 00:11:12,723
Oh, hey. No, change of plans.
Oh.

235
00:11:12,747 --> 00:11:16,249
Uh, uh, vanessa hoyt,
this is addison montgomery.

236
00:11:16,757 --> 00:11:19,637
Vanessa hoyt
the, uh, perinatologist?

237
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:20,945
And neonatologist.

238
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:23,703
I've heard a lot
about you, too. Good things.
From sam?

239
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:27,287
Um, no. I didn't realize
the two of you knew each other.

240
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,529
I-I didn't realize you two
knew each other either. Yeah.

241
00:11:29,553 --> 00:11:32,450
Well, sam asked me to consult
on a case last week,

242
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:34,474
And we just hit it off.

243
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:36,565
Well, that's nice...

244
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:40,025
That he asked you to consult
on a case...

245
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:43,665
Involving a pregnant patient
from his practice.

246
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:47,971
So I have a minute
if you want to grab coffee?

247
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:50,657
Sure, sure. Let's go.
Okay. Nice to meet you.

248
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:51,922
okay.

249
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,089
Hi.

250
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:57,621
Thanks for fitting this
into your day.

251
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,488
I thought may was having
an allergic reaction,

252
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:02,578
But I-I just can't
pin it down.
No worries.

253
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:11,325
You seem... More relaxed
than I've seen you in a while.

254
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:14,390
Well, that's william.
Ah, love.

255
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:16,556
No, not--not love.

256
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:19,932
Well, maybe eventually love.

257
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:22,091
No, he's wooing me.

258
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:24,191
Well, I gotta hand it
to the guy. He's got class.

259
00:12:24,215 --> 00:12:25,875
And it's good
to see you looking so happy.

260
00:12:28,517 --> 00:12:30,368
You and addison...

261
00:12:31,971 --> 00:12:34,086
I didn't think
anybody knew about that.

262
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,703
Yeah, well, addison told me.
What about you and violet?

263
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:40,342
Violet's on vacation.
Well, don't you think
that could be good for violet,

264
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:43,584
Getting away from it all?
She's spent the last nine months
away from it all.

265
00:12:47,523 --> 00:12:49,202
What is it?

266
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,706
(naomi)
the tests from your exam

267
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,765
Show that you had
an allergic reaction.

268
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:56,122
And that's why I brought in
dr. Wilder.
So what's she allergic to?

269
00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:59,607
She's allergic
to your sperm.

270
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:00,611
My sperm?

271
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:03,267
Yes, it's a rare reaction
to a protein in the fluid.

272
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,126
Which can lead to
an anaphylactic reaction

273
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,482
The next time
she's exposed.

274
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:08,125
It's sort of like
a peanut allergy.

275
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:10,998
Once you have it,
e next time's usually worse.

276
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:12,974
But you can fix it, right?

277
00:13:12,998 --> 00:13:16,240
Well.. this type
of allergy is complicated.

278
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:17,930
I'm looking into
possible treatments,

279
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:22,094
But right now...
No, I can't.

280
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:24,318
we can't be allergic
to each other.

281
00:13:24,342 --> 00:13:27,352
A-and what about kids? We both
want to have kids someday.

282
00:13:27,376 --> 00:13:30,178
And if I'm allergic
to his sperm--
that's--that's where
we can help.

283
00:13:30,202 --> 00:13:32,512
We can wash the sperm
and inseminate.

284
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:34,244
And if that doesn't solve
the problem,

285
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:36,685
Then we can do in vitro
with your eggs.

286
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,377
So, uh, a baby someday.

287
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:44,424
But--but we can't be, um...
Intimate?

288
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,016
Y-yes, you can be,
just safely.

289
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,466
You need to make sure
you use a condom

290
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,006
Until dr. Wilder
can figure this out.

291
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:55,355
I just wanted everything
to be perfect.

292
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:58,647
Thank you.

293
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:02,340
<i>Buenos dias!</i>

294
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:05,534
Well, look who forgot
the s.P.F.

295
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,204
this is for you.

296
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:13,275
costa rica--
best coffee in the world.

297
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,570
I thought you were
touching monkeys.
That was the plan,

298
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:16,975
And then we went
to the airport,

299
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:20,354
And we said, "no plans--
costa rica."

300
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:22,177
White sand beaches,
fabulous music,

301
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:24,792
A steady stream of alcohol...

302
00:14:24,816 --> 00:14:26,882
It was very zen.

303
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:30,509
Did you just say "zen"
to me?
It was relaxing, charlotte.

304
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,770
did you go to central amera
or did you join a cult?

305
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:34,270
coop, you're back.

306
00:14:34,294 --> 00:14:35,796
Pete!

307
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:38,799
He's zen.

308
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,425
Mm. Best coffee
in the world. Mm-hmm.

309
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:43,340
Um, I actually came
to borrow a book from you.

310
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:45,940
Semen allergies.
I'll see what I have.

311
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:49,002
So... What about violet?

312
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:50,135
Is she zen, too?

313
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,301
Oh, violet. Violet, uh,
she didn't come back.

314
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,939
She decided to stay.

315
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,608
she decided to stay?

316
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,002
I-I... She won't see her kid,
she won't get help,

317
00:15:03,026 --> 00:15:04,971
And suddenly
she's a costa rican woman.

318
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:07,419
Ooh. Light just went on
in the den.

319
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:10,218
I bet he's pouring her
a glass of wine--

320
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,687
A big old glass of red wine,
my wine.
Addison--

321
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:16,406
Oh, come on. He's dating
a neonatal specialist, pete.

322
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,736
It's obvious what he's doing.

323
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,157
Ooh, ooh. Light just went off
in the kitchen.

324
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:22,054
Addison,
come away from the window.

325
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:23,691
Come away from the window now.

326
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:26,889
Come on.

327
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:36,080
He's happy.

328
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:37,827
She's zen.

329
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:40,358
Come on.
Mm.

330
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,613
We're hoible.

331
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:44,559
We shouldn't be jealous
like this.

332
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,616
We have each other.
We should be happy for them.

333
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:49,453
Yeah, I-I know.

334
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:55,011
Yes.

335
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,606
Okay.

336
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:00,419
Yeah. Thanks.

337
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:02,792
What is it?

338
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:06,299
I gotta admit,

339
00:16:06,323 --> 00:16:09,370
I was surprised you askeme
over for dinner tonight.

340
00:16:09,394 --> 00:16:11,719
Why?
Well, it's...

341
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:14,492
Okay, I was actually surprised
you said yes

342
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,848
When I asked you out.

343
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:18,907
You know, I've been around,
and you never noticed me.

344
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,069
No, I noticed you.

345
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:23,345
It's just that, um...

346
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:25,476
Oh, you were
seeing someone else?

347
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:29,662
Well, I'm not seeing
someone else anymore.

348
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:30,760
Okay.

349
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:33,171
Hey, sam.
Addison, what, uh--

350
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:35,669
Uh, esau's tests came back.
It's m.D.R.

351
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:38,028
His t.B. Is drug resistant?
We should tell him.

352
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:41,602
That was nice of you to come all
the way out here to tell sam.

353
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,090
I live next door.

354
00:16:43,114 --> 00:16:44,541
Oh.
I should go. Um...

355
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:45,713
Okay.
All right, I'll--

356
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:48,711
No, no, you know what?
I'll deal with it. Just go.
Oh, thank you.

357
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:54,483
uh, I'll meet you after.
Your place?

358
00:16:54,507 --> 00:16:56,103
Okay.
I'm so sorry.

359
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,501
From your trip?
Yeah.

360
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:03,334
Hey, look at this.

361
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:05,164
Banana fiber.
Can u believe that?

362
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:09,390
Someone could take a banana
and make that. Costa rica.

363
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:12,373
I was wondering if you had
a number for violet.

364
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:14,662
One of her patients--I need
to get her on a plane.

365
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:18,629
I mean, violet's patient,
not violet.
No, sorry. She's trekking
in the rain forest,

366
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:19,621
Next couple of weeks.

367
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:22,774
Cooper, is she--I mean, is this
good or is she running away?

368
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:24,770
No, no, no. It's good.
It's therapeutic.

369
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:25,930
Well,
I'm all for therapeutic--

370
00:17:25,954 --> 00:17:28,527
And you covering her patients
has been very helpful.

371
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:32,191
She doesn't have to worry
about them. She knows they're--
well, great, great.
No pressure there.

372
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,196
Sorry. It's just, uh,
as I said,

373
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,990
There's one
I'm struggling with.

374
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:41,515
Well, day after day,

375
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:45,151
The sun... You know?

376
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:47,193
It's zen.

377
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:51,027
Oh, I found zen... Once.

378
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:53,572
It was the best couple hours
of my life.

379
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:55,983
How long does he have to be
in quarantine?

380
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:58,757
Up to six months.
We can't risk an outbreak.

381
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:00,061
They're gonna be devastated.

382
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:02,173
Always fun
to break people's hearts.

383
00:18:08,284 --> 00:18:09,683
He's gone.

384
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,399
They're gone.

385
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:18,446
So I'm just gonna
drive up tomorrow.

386
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,326
I don't need to fly.

387
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,777
I can have a good life
without ever leaving the ground.

388
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,044
You wanted this, natasha.

389
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:26,231
What's the point?

390
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:27,963
We've been over the crash
a hundred times.

391
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:29,802
Then let's not talk
about the crash.

392
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:31,839
Let's talk about yesterday.
Okay? Talk me through it.

393
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:34,017
We'll see if we can figure out
what triggered you. Okay?

394
00:18:37,223 --> 00:18:38,545
okay.

395
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:42,551
We sat down.

396
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:46,168
And... Then
the announcement came on,

397
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,570
Talking about
the emergency procedures.

398
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:52,424
And I was still okay.

399
00:18:52,817 --> 00:18:55,351
Then what happened?

400
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,188
I mean, what started you
feeling anxious?

401
00:18:58,816 --> 00:19:00,699
I don't know.

402
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,652
I just freaked out.

403
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:06,046
Think about what you were
thinking before that happened.

404
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,329
You know, u talked about
your sister and the wedding...

405
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,623
Natasha?

406
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,662
What happened?

407
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,580
It was you.

408
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:29,211
You touched my arm
and told me to breathe

409
00:19:30,207 --> 00:19:32,211
Just like she did.

410
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,346
Like violet?

411
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,594
No, the woman who sat
next to me in the crash.

412
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,923
The woman I killed.

413
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:54,914
Any luck in finding them?

414
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:57,272
I've called everyone
in elisha's file.

415
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,450
No one's heard from them--
the grad school, nothing.

416
00:19:59,474 --> 00:20:03,003
And esau
has no family here, so.
They could be anywhere,
incting anyone.

417
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:04,981
We should've talked to elisha
more after we told her

418
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,605
She couldn't take her baby
out of the country.
You're saying I scared her?

419
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:11,623
No, that's not
what I said, sam.
All right.
Well, I'm calling immigration.

420
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,725
No, sam. That is not our job.
We're not the police.
Leaving isolation
at the hospital

421
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:19,267
Was irresponsible.
They're not going to knowingly
put anyone at risk.

422
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,271
Let me try
and find them, okay?
Now you're being irresponsible.

423
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:24,359
<i>Oh, really?
I'm being irresponsible?</i>

424
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,742
What is that
supposed to mean?

425
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,668
Oh, this is about vanessa.

426
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:31,350
She works on babies, sam.

427
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:33,217
You're dating someone
you think will get to me.

428
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,827
All right, you're jealous.
And you know what?

429
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:37,861
You don't get to be jealous
because you made your choice.

430
00:20:40,477 --> 00:20:42,306
Sam, don'tall, okay?

431
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,889
Look, they're scared.
They're in trouble.

432
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:47,307
The last thing they need is
immigration coming down on them.

433
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:54,110
I looked out
and...

434
00:20:54,134 --> 00:20:56,891
I saw the wing hit the ground.

435
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:58,604
And there was...

436
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,302
There was smoke...

437
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:03,541
And then fire...

438
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:06,444
And screaming.

439
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:10,317
I unbuckled my seat belt.

440
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:12,591
But the woman xt to me,
she...

441
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:14,921
She couldn't
get her belt undone.

442
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:18,238
And... She was screaming,

443
00:21:18,262 --> 00:21:20,066
"help me. Please help me."

444
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:25,256
But I just wanted to get out.

445
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,406
I was so scared.

446
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,906
And I looked at her,
and she was scared.

447
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,646
But I ran.

448
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:38,232
I could hear her screaming,
and...

449
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,339
And I just ran away.

450
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:43,087
You didn't kill her.
The crash did.

451
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:45,823
If you had stayed,
you would've died, too.
I could've done more.

452
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:49,437
I waawful.
I killed that woman.

453
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:53,372
I can't
talk my way out of that.

454
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,924
I can't breathe my way
past it.

455
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:56,727
Natasha--

456
00:21:56,751 --> 00:22:00,840
No. Tell violet
I'm done with therapy. I quit.

457
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:06,602
I'm only saying,

458
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,828
We can block the formation
of cicatricial tissue--

459
00:22:08,852 --> 00:22:10,842
The neurons are spared
permanent damage,

460
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:12,515
And people like me
would be able to walk

461
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,326
No matter how bad
the injury they sustained?

462
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,761
I read last month's
"new England journal," too.

463
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,401
I'll leave you to it.

464
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:25,348
Fife.

465
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:26,888
I don't like
being patronized.

466
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,859
Even by our patron?

467
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:30,864
What do you
have against him?

468
00:22:30,888 --> 00:22:32,840
Hey! What?

469
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:35,347
William white doesn't know you.
He just likes the idea of you.

470
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:37,518
You'd be like
a trophy in his case.

471
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,255
That's what you'd do for him.

472
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:41,271
But since I read once,

473
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:42,885
When you're fighting
for a girl you love,

474
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:44,984
You shouldn't put down
the competition

475
00:22:45,008 --> 00:22:47,004
Because it makes you
look insecure,

476
00:22:47,028 --> 00:22:49,163
I'll bring it back to me.

477
00:22:49,187 --> 00:22:52,765
Um... I know I'm abrasive.

478
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,186
I know I'm snide.

479
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,203
But.

480
00:22:58,227 --> 00:23:00,900
You make me a better person.

481
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:06,560
That's what you do...
For me.

482
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,018
You gonna eat it
or make love to it?

483
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:24,682
Bananas are amazing.

484
00:23:24,706 --> 00:23:26,442
I will never look at one
the same way again.

485
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:30,712
Here. You can have this one.
I'll find another.

486
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:34,340
Ooh! What's your problem?
(lowered voice)
cut the zen crap, cooper.

487
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:38,391
You follow me into the bathroom
and then take off for two weeks.
I know. It was a mistake,
which is why I left.

488
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:41,256
But I'm not angry anymore.
Well, I am.

489
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,435
The sex didn't have to mean
we were a happy couple again,

490
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:46,230
But it had to mean something.
It did.
It meant I was still angry.

491
00:23:46,254 --> 00:23:48,409
I've been sitting on a beach
with a therapist

492
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:49,454
Working this out.

493
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:53,275
That moment has passed.
We can move on with our lives.

494
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,308
I forgive you.
You forgive me?

495
00:23:55,332 --> 00:23:56,262
Yes. Ow! Ow!

496
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,784
You need
to talk to somebody

497
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,046
About your eating disorder.

498
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,523
Shut up.

499
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,263
Fife's in love with me.

500
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:09,022
Really?

501
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:11,477
You're sure?

502
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:12,952
Yeah, because he told me so.

503
00:24:12,976 --> 00:24:14,800
He said
I make him a better person.

504
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,788
Damn it.

505
00:24:17,812 --> 00:24:19,475
Yeah.

506
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,570
Jeez. How do you turn down
the guy in the wheelchair?

507
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:23,793
What? Oh, god. I don't--

508
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:25,270
I don't even nice
the wheelchair anymore.

509
00:24:25,294 --> 00:24:28,502
I mean, but--but who...
Who does he think he is?

510
00:24:28,526 --> 00:24:30,946
How does get off loving me?
I mean, he is mean.

511
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,940
He is mean and he is sarcastic
and he's morally adrift.

512
00:24:34,964 --> 00:24:36,580
He'd steal my d.N.A.
And clone me

513
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:37,667
If he could get away with it.

514
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:39,344
He--he is everything
that I hate.

515
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:42,384
No, he's not--he's not allowed
to--he's not allowed to love me.

516
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,519
What?

517
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:48,656
You like him.

518
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:51,458
No. I am dating william.

519
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:53,352
You like him a lot.

520
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:56,515
Oh, my god.

521
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:58,439
I like him a lot.

522
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,018
Yes.

523
00:25:02,222 --> 00:25:03,380
Uh, she can't breathe.

524
00:25:03,404 --> 00:25:05,445
She--she thr up, and, uh,
she started sweating.

525
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:08,940
Slow down.
Tell me what happened.
Uh, we used a condom.
I don't know.

526
00:25:08,964 --> 00:25:10,128
We thought we were being safe.

527
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:12,549
She almost stopped breathing
in the ambulance.
epi's on board,

528
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:13,920
But her pulse ox is dropping.

529
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,650
I'm gonna intubate.
I can't believe...

530
00:25:16,674 --> 00:25:18,878
Don't talk. I need to listen.
Prep the tube,

531
00:25:18,902 --> 00:25:20,786
But give me one minute.
She may not have a minute.

532
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,149
May, I know you're scared...
Dr. Wilder!

533
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:24,287
But it's making
your breathing worse.

534
00:25:24,311 --> 00:25:26,665
I need you to take
slow, deep breaths.

535
00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:30,522
Henry, come take her hand.
Slow, deep breaths.

536
00:25:30,546 --> 00:25:32,877
Feel the air fill your lungs.
Good.

537
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:37,948
good. Just like that.

538
00:25:39,025 --> 00:25:40,423
Good.

539
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:43,916
Her airways are opening up.

540
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,965
what happened?

541
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:48,052
How could this happen
after we took every precaution?

542
00:25:48,076 --> 00:25:49,651
I don't know.

543
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:51,254
I don't know.

544
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:56,485
Hi.

545
00:25:56,815 --> 00:26:00,387
Well, I don't know
if the condom broke or leaked.

546
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:01,863
It could've been too big.

547
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:03,947
People have a tendency
to buy 'em a little big.

548
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:07,234
Anyway, there was
seminal fluid present.
It's not your fault, henry.

549
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:10,018
But it is.
You're allergic to me.

550
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:13,526
We got unlucky. It broke.
How often does that happen?

551
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,581
We'll be fine.

552
00:26:14,605 --> 00:26:17,428
I-I can't have sex
knowing that every time,

553
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:19,562
Something could go wrong
and I could kill you.

554
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:21,818
Henry--
I love you.

555
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:24,842
I never thought I'd find
somebody who gets me.

556
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:27,077
I don't want to be alone,
but the thought of hurting you--

557
00:26:27,101 --> 00:26:29,675
Guys, guys,
let me find something.

558
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:33,683
The last thing I want
is for you to... Forgo sex.

559
00:26:33,707 --> 00:26:36,019
I will find a way. Okay?

560
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:47,626
I haven't been stood up
since...

561
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,012
Oh, that's right. Ever.

562
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:51,038
I'd like to thk you
for letting me experience

563
00:26:51,062 --> 00:26:52,109
That unique humiliation

564
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:55,562
That I had somehow managed
to escape... Until now.

565
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,532
I was supposed to meet you
back at your place.

566
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:04,126
You're just remembering this?

567
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,781
Vanessa, I'm so sorry.

568
00:27:05,805 --> 00:27:08,224
I had a patient, and--and he'd
left the hospital.

569
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,409
I'm so sorry

570
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:12,291
I like you, sam.

571
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:14,520
I could really
see myself with you.

572
00:27:14,544 --> 00:27:16,852
And a few years ago, I'd have
ignored this voice in my head

573
00:27:16,876 --> 00:27:18,812
That says
you're not where I am.

574
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:21,132
I'd try and make you feel
what I'm feeling.

575
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:24,333
I-I feel... I like you.

576
00:27:25,216 --> 00:27:27,032
Addison montgomery.

577
00:27:27,056 --> 00:27:28,822
My entire professional life,

578
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:30,958
I have been riding
in the shadows of the reputation

579
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,635
Of the famous
double board certified redhead.

580
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:37,359
I am not gonna do it
in my personal life, too.
Ad-addison and me--

581
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:39,159
I don't want to know.

582
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,309
I'm a catch, sam--

583
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:44,989
An honest-to-god catch.

584
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:47,573
But you're gonna have
chase me to catch me.

585
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:51,246
Vanessa--

586
00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:01,957
Esau, are you all right?

587
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:04,226
It's elisha. She's in labor.
Okay, let's notify the o.B.

588
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,573
And get her upstairs
on a monitor.

589
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:08,426
You're doing great, elisha.
We were on our way
to her mom's

590
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,764
Because I was scared
about immigration,

591
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,811
But then
the contractions started.

592
00:28:12,296 --> 00:28:14,771
Come on, we should get you
back to isolation.
No, no. I need to be with her.

593
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:16,088
It's not safe
for either of them.

594
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,044
Come. Come with me. Esau.

595
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:27,349
You gonna pull your hair out?

596
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:30,110
No, no.
Yeah, well... Maybe.

597
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:32,827
I'm not sure bald's
the right look for you.

598
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:34,721
I'm just having a bad run.

599
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,459
You, too?

600
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,988
Cooper's back.
He's all zen.

601
00:28:42,161 --> 00:28:43,688
It bothers you?

602
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,462
I beat him with a banana.

603
00:28:45,497 --> 00:28:47,382
You gonna shrink me
and tell me why?

604
00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:49,952
He's past the anger.

605
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:52,247
You're afraid it means
he's really over you.

606
00:28:52,282 --> 00:28:53,596
You're pretty good
at this stuff.

607
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:56,317
no, I'm failing everybody.

608
00:28:56,352 --> 00:28:58,489
I try to help people,
and they run.

609
00:28:58,524 --> 00:29:00,205
Violet ran.
Hepatient ran.

610
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,139
Two means
you're failing everybody?

611
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,525
Don't shrinks tell people

612
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,050
To avoid global statements
like that?

613
00:29:05,085 --> 00:29:07,221
Yeah, well,
it feels like everybody.

614
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:10,593
Do you know how hard
I tried to help violet?

615
00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:13,102
Maybe you didn't push too hard.
You didn't push hard enough.

616
00:29:13,137 --> 00:29:15,352
I can't force a patient
to continue therapy.

617
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,520
You can let her know
quitting's for losers.

618
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,995
Nudge her
in the right direction.

619
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,462
You can show her settling
is a coward's way out.

620
00:29:21,497 --> 00:29:24,282
Or you can sit here and pull
your hair out until you go bald.

621
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,055
Thank you.

622
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,637
Whatever.

623
00:29:29,672 --> 00:29:34,574
Pete...

624
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:37,007
You don't
have to find a cure.

625
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,594
he broke up with me.

626
00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:40,880
I just wanted
to let you know.

627
00:29:40,915 --> 00:29:44,713
I didn't want
to waste your time.
I'm so sorry, may. Here.

628
00:29:50,971 --> 00:29:52,219
I can't stop crying.

629
00:29:52,254 --> 00:29:53,867
Well, I know it's hard,

630
00:29:53,902 --> 00:29:56,229
Losing something
you felt was right,

631
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:58,265
But sex...

632
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,491
Is important.

633
00:30:00,526 --> 00:30:02,031
And maybe it's better
to end it now

634
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,883
Before it got serious.

635
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:05,776
I know I just met him,

636
00:30:05,811 --> 00:30:07,137
And that may not
make sense to you,

637
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:10,017
But... Oh, he was the one.

638
00:30:10,052 --> 00:30:14,300
I've spent my whole life
waiting for someone like henry.

639
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:16,892
and now he's gone.

640
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:22,671
But... Oh,
he still has my heart.

641
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:24,873
And maybe he always will.

642
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:27,612
You'll find someone else.
Just give it time.

643
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:29,645
Do you really believe that?

644
00:30:30,566 --> 00:30:32,481
I do.

645
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,197
I'm sorry.

646
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,723
Tell naomi to forget about
the eggs, too.

647
00:30:40,758 --> 00:30:42,553
I can't do it on my own.

648
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:44,566
After henry...

649
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:46,724
I'm done.

650
00:30:49,165 --> 00:30:51,054
Elisha's labor
is progressing quickly.

651
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:53,172
But the baby--
everything looks good so far.

652
00:30:53,207 --> 00:30:55,297
I'll have a neonatal team
standing by.

653
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:58,256
I'll give you an update as soon
as the baby's born, okay?

654
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:06,310
Is that esau ajawke?
Yes, it is.

655
00:31:06,345 --> 00:31:08,724
I'm agent jones with immigration
and customs enforcement.

656
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:11,842
I have an order here
to detain mr. Ajawke.

657
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:21,320
Addison.

658
00:31:21,758 --> 00:31:24,584
I told you not to call.
Well, I did
what I thought was right.

659
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:26,013
How is
tearing them apart right?

660
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:28,659
She can't go to kenya.
He can't stay here.
What do you want me to say?

661
00:31:28,694 --> 00:31:30,852
Sometimes love
doesn't always work out.

662
00:31:31,294 --> 00:31:32,962
No, sometimes it doesn't.

663
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:35,286
Oh, come on now.
I'm trying to move on here.

664
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:37,140
I'm trying to be happy.

665
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:38,488
Yeah, well, good for you.

666
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:40,822
In the meantime, I have to
deliver elisha's baby--

667
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,835
A baby that esau
isn't even going to see.

668
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,950
How are they
supposed to move on?

669
00:31:50,127 --> 00:31:52,172
"on semen"?
A little light reading?

670
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:54,828
May almost died.

671
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:57,471
Henry's condom broke
or leaked.

672
00:31:57,506 --> 00:31:58,900
He left her.

673
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:00,873
Oh, that's awful.

674
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:02,506
They were perfect.

675
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:04,065
It makes you wonder if there's
some kind of message in it--

676
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,682
Biology telling them
they don't belong together.

677
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,919
Well... I mean,
there are the people

678
00:32:08,954 --> 00:32:10,126
That are right
for you on paper,

679
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:13,948
And then there are the people
that are just right.

680
00:32:13,983 --> 00:32:14,840
Is it settling

681
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,646
If you go with the person
who's right for you on paper?

682
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:19,612
Maybe there's nothing wrong
with settling...

683
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:22,504
With being wooed.
Sometimes the person
who's just right...

684
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:24,735
Doesn't want you.

685
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,868
Or they do,
and they are just... Wrong.

686
00:32:28,903 --> 00:32:30,313
Yeah.

687
00:32:34,058 --> 00:32:35,197
Are we gonna have--

688
00:32:35,232 --> 00:32:36,879
Have this discussion? No, no.
No, okay.

689
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,644
Oh. God, I really wanted may
to get her guy.

690
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,650
Me, too.

691
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:01,774
I'm sorry.
This isn't something I do.

692
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:04,797
I value your privacy and your
desion to not do therapy.

693
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:06,872
Dr. Wallace--
no, I just
have something to say,

694
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:08,006
And then I'll leave,

695
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:10,497
And you can do
whatever feels right for you.

696
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:12,615
I wanted to be a surgeon.
Look, I d--I don't--

697
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,786
Medical school,
stanford, 1986--

698
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:19,159
E.R. Rotation
during my internship.

699
00:33:21,897 --> 00:33:24,661
My first night on call,
there was a bus accident.

700
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:26,561
The place
was flooded with people,

701
00:33:26,596 --> 00:33:29,270
And I was assigned this guy
whose leg was mangled,

702
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:31,364
And--and he was in pain.

703
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:34,443
He was yelling
and screaming at me, and...

704
00:33:35,928 --> 00:33:39,184
I couldn't stop the bleeding.

705
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:42,414
I called for help,
and--and everyone was busy.

706
00:33:42,449 --> 00:33:45,143
And this guy, he--he started
kicking and yelling at me.

707
00:33:45,178 --> 00:33:47,138
And I let go
of the compression,

708
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:49,245
And he bled out.

709
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,760
And he kept yelling at me
until he was dead.

710
00:33:54,514 --> 00:33:56,287
I faked illness
for the rest of the week,

711
00:33:56,322 --> 00:33:58,580
And as soon as I could,
I switched to psychiatry.

712
00:33:58,615 --> 00:34:00,713
See, I ran.

713
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:02,905
My father was a surgeon.

714
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,083
And that's all I ever wanted
was to make him proud.

715
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:09,712
I haven't been through
a plane crash.

716
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,887
But I know what it's like

717
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:14,766
Not to push through
what you want to do.

718
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:16,980
And y-you saved yourself,
natasha.

719
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:20,766
That-that's not wrong.
No, it--it's human. It is.

720
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:22,177
And I don't want
to push you to be scared.

721
00:34:22,212 --> 00:34:23,948
I want to push you
past being scared

722
00:34:23,983 --> 00:34:26,099
So you can have what you want,
so you can have the life

723
00:34:26,134 --> 00:34:27,451
You wanted to have
before the crash.

724
00:34:27,486 --> 00:34:29,711
And I know I'm not violet,
but I can help you.

725
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:34,527
So just please...
Let me help you.

726
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:47,459
We'll be heading out soon.
Mm-hmm.

727
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,760
Copy that.

728
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:56,669
The ambulance arrived.
We're gonna be taking him now.

729
00:34:56,704 --> 00:34:59,348
Uh, I'm sorry. You can't.
The nurses just paged me.

730
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:01,594
His oxygen levels
have dropped.

731
00:35:01,629 --> 00:35:03,190
It's probably
due to the infection

732
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:06,800
Or the fluid that's collecting
in his lungs.
Is that right?

733
00:35:07,724 --> 00:35:08,986
Look, if you take him now,

734
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:11,676
You'll have a body on your hands
by the time you get there.

735
00:35:15,005 --> 00:35:16,404
Thank you.

736
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:19,405
Dr. Montgomery's
delivering your baby.

737
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,971
If you want to see him,
put this mask on

738
00:35:21,006 --> 00:35:23,023
And start acting sicker.

739
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,033
I think you're lying.

740
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:28,214
Are you sure?
Are you a doctor?

741
00:35:28,249 --> 00:35:30,272
You might want to step back.
He's very contagious.

742
00:35:30,307 --> 00:35:32,414
Wouldn't want
to put you at risk.

743
00:35:33,955 --> 00:35:37,189
We'll wait
till he's stable.

744
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:49,973
Henry.

745
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,501
I asked henry to come
because--
he can fix it, may.

746
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:54,593
You--you can fix it?

747
00:35:54,628 --> 00:35:56,562
<i>I can try to fix it.</i>

748
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:58,921
There are breakthroughs
being made

749
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:01,696
In desensiting people
to this type of allergy.

750
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:03,416
Uh, desensitizing, how?

751
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:06,092
I would use injections
of henry's seminal fluid.

752
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:07,796
Mm-hmm.
Expose you to small traces

753
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:10,546
And build up
your immune response over time.

754
00:36:10,581 --> 00:36:12,853
How much time?
It could take six months,
maybe a year.

755
00:36:12,888 --> 00:36:14,935
There's no guarantee
this will work.

756
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,424
Look, told you
that it would be okay,

757
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:21,398
But what you two have,
you ci envy it.On.

758
00:36:21,853 --> 00:36:26,966
So maybe it's enough to survive
for some time with no sex.

759
00:36:39,228 --> 00:36:41,537
He's beautiful.

760
00:36:42,129 --> 00:36:44,177
He's so beautiful.

761
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:46,536
Thank you.

762
00:36:51,757 --> 00:36:54,047
Okay,
I can't stall anymore.

763
00:36:55,765 --> 00:36:57,241
You gotta go now.

764
00:37:04,046 --> 00:37:05,673
I love you.

765
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,596
And I love you.

766
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:49,115
Do I think about you
when I'm with her? Yeah.

767
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:53,029
But I can't wait around
for something I can'have.

768
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:54,627
I won't.

769
00:37:55,118 --> 00:37:57,565
And you shouldn't
expect me to.

770
00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:11,662
Sourdough.

771
00:38:11,697 --> 00:38:13,337
I've been
to san francisco today...

772
00:38:13,372 --> 00:38:15,872
On a plane with the patient
who was afraid to fly.

773
00:38:15,907 --> 00:38:18,032
She did great.
So that's my way of saying,

774
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:21,189
"thanks for kicking my butt
into gear."
congratulations. You did it.

775
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:24,764
No. No, you did it. So take
the thanks, take the sourdough

776
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:27,434
And, uh, well, take this.

777
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:35,115
I know you're not
a huggy-type person.

778
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,570
But I, uh, I really needed
to do that.

779
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,767
Didn't kill me.

780
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:43,568
Well, I should, uh... Go.

781
00:38:45,413 --> 00:38:46,855
Sheldon.

782
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,477
Do you like martinis?

783
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:56,038
I ran track in high school.

784
00:38:56,073 --> 00:38:58,903
Well, I went out
for the team.

785
00:38:58,938 --> 00:39:01,640
I-I didn't make it
'cause I had asthma.

786
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:04,592
But... I can run
pretty fast.

787
00:39:04,627 --> 00:39:07,003
I'm sorry.
What is your point?

788
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:10,164
My point is that...

789
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:12,420
I'm ready to chase you.

790
00:39:12,455 --> 00:39:16,104
But you better be ready
to get caught.

791
00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:19,378
You're very good
with the lines.

792
00:39:19,413 --> 00:39:22,833
Yes. Yes, I am.

793
00:39:24,857 --> 00:39:26,783
Charlotte.

794
00:39:27,557 --> 00:39:30,045
Chlotte, if you're here,
I tried calling.

795
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:32,526
I gotta send violet her mail.

796
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:34,506
Cooper?

797
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,597
What the hell
are you doing here?

798
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:39,527
I'll be gone in a minute.
I just g--

799
00:39:39,562 --> 00:39:41,998
Charlotte made martinis.

800
00:39:51,691 --> 00:39:54,788
I think he's lost his zen.

801
00:40:01,473 --> 00:40:04,304
So you're, uh,
you're off to the ballet?

802
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:06,009
Uh, yes, I am.

803
00:40:07,302 --> 00:40:08,642
That what you're wearing?

804
00:40:08,677 --> 00:40:09,870
Why?

805
00:40:09,905 --> 00:40:12,496
I was just gonna say,
you look stunning.

806
00:40:18,414 --> 00:40:19,863
Shall we?

807
00:40:19,898 --> 00:40:21,078
Uh, yeah.

808
00:40:39,964 --> 00:40:41,478
He's moved on.

809
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,945
So has she.

810
00:40:53,956 --> 00:40:56,345
I don't want to alarm you,

811
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,269
But I am going to cry now.

812
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:11,354
I'm gonna hold you
while you cry.

813
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:19,243
