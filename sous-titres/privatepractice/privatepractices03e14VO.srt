00:00:19,615 --> 00:00:21,753
She's my patient...
Lauren Woods, 33 weeks.

3
00:00:21,777 --> 00:00:23,836
Can you tell me what
happened, Lauren, anything?

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,788
Coast guard fished her
out of Santa Monica Bay.

5
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:28,443
- Did anybody see anything?
- Already in the water when she was spotted.

6
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:31,562
- Michael? Where's Michael?
- Hold on, Lauren. Hang in there.

7
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:37,062
She's in v-tach. Get her
in trauma surgery two.

8
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:39,483
All right, sounds like
classic VSD consistent with

9
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:41,516
a large defect between the
right and left ventricles.

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,942
- This is new?
- Never been there before.

11
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:44,088
The stress from the accident

12
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:46,500
probably blew the underlying defect open.

13
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:49,103
- Pulse ox is dropping. Her lungs collapsed.
- Needs a chest tube.

14
00:00:49,127 --> 00:00:53,016
- I got it. - All right, put her
under. Prep for an emergency c-section.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,506
The baby's in severe distress.

16
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:03,236
Pressure's dropping.

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,386
- She's throwing multiple PVCs. -
She's back in v-tach. Crash cart.

18
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,737
- Lost her pressure. - All
right. V-fib. Charge to 200.

19
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:09,353
- Addison, we gotta get that baby outta there.
- Almost.

20
00:01:09,377 --> 00:01:11,800
She's in cardiac arrest. Addison, now.

21
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:17,942
All right, clear.

22
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:30,578
Hey.

23
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:32,119
Hey.

24
00:01:33,548 --> 00:01:35,784
I guess you're going to the
St. Ambrose thing tonight?

25
00:01:35,808 --> 00:01:37,764
No choice. William White's being honored.

26
00:01:37,788 --> 00:01:40,086
He writes my checks. You?

27
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:42,336
Oh, no.

28
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,856
I used to like parties, but now...

29
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,109
I don't know. The big crowd...

30
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:50,840
Guess that's all part of the crazy, huh?

31
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:52,221
Avoiding dull speeches,

32
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,540
big egos and drunken colleagues?

33
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,032
Maybe not so crazy.

34
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:01,782
Are you being nice to me?

35
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:05,527
Maybe.

36
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,665
A little.

37
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:10,722
Morning.

38
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:12,589
Morning.

39
00:02:14,545 --> 00:02:16,984
Did you get a chance to look
at the data I e-mailed you

40
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:20,422
on my, uh, human cloning project?

41
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:22,676
Human cloning.

42
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,601
I've decided it's time to clone people.

43
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,640
- Yeah, well, I'm trying to work.
- Which is all you've been doing lately.

44
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:32,421
It's easier here than at home.

45
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:37,962
Home is lonely, and, uh... work is good.

46
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:41,945
You know, I could help...

47
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:44,978
with work mostly.

48
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:47,332
The emotional stuff...
I'm a little crippled.

49
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,802
Thank you.

50
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:57,166
Naomi.

51
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,834
I, uh, I...

52
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:01,401
Um... I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

53
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:02,789
Yes.

54
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:04,395
No. No, we were just working.

55
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:08,765
I just wanted to say thank
you in advance, for tonight.

56
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,204
I really do appreciate it.

57
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:12,618
Well, I am honored, really.

58
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:13,892
Sucking up to the boss.

59
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,589
No, I am presenting William with his award

60
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,503
- at the ball tonight.
- You're coming, right?

61
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:21,696
- Got my dancing shoes on.
- Good. Good.

62
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:26,125
Anyway, I just, uh...

63
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:29,017
wanted to express my gratitude.

64
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:32,792
I'm sure your speech will be tremendous,

65
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,340
impressive as always.

66
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:56,463
How's Lauren?

67
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:59,089
Uh, she's sedated, in ICU.

68
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,291
Echo showed a persistent VSD in her heart.

69
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:04,054
She needs surgery, and I can't
do that until she's stable.

70
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:07,918
- How's the baby?
- Her lungs aren't mature enough. She's having a hard time.

71
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:11,061
You were good in there this morning.

72
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,407
Did you get in contact with her husband?

73
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:15,530
I tried.

74
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:19,291
Okay, well, I'm gonna
go check up on Lauren

75
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:21,268
and then go back to the practice.

76
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:23,273
Sam.

77
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:26,787
Can we just... will you talk to me?

78
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:30,478
I'll keep you posted on Lauren.

79
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:35,998
"No" is not an option.

80
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:38,420
Addison's memo said
everybody goes to the ball.

81
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,763
All right, well, I'm
gonna go ahead and pull

82
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:42,956
the "wife died, single parent card," so...

83
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,405
- I'm out.
- Oh, I was attacked.

84
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:46,334
You may have read about
it? Yeah, it kinda gives me

85
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:50,351
- carte blanche to ignore all memos.
- No, no, no, no. People, you know, life happens, we move on.

86
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,472
We use big, gaudy events like this

87
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:53,861
to move on with our lives.

88
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:56,524
Me? Broke up with my girlfriend.

89
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:57,977
Yeah. Small potatoes, maybe,

90
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:00,972
but I'm really looking forward
to getting out there and...

91
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,491
And forgetting about the past.

92
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:09,197
- You ever gonna grow up?
- Oh, I hope not.

93
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,374
I'm feeling so much
younger and freer lately.

94
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:13,645
Yes. Hey, can you tell Dell and Violet

95
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:15,355
that this thing tonight
is a command performance?

96
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:19,098
Oh, it is. We all go.
We're gonna brush our teeth,

97
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:21,202
we're gonna put on expensive clothes,

98
00:05:21,226 --> 00:05:22,618
we're gonna go to this fancy party,

99
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:24,187
and we're gonna have fun.

100
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:26,312
We're gonna have fun, okay?

101
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:29,650
Yeah, so...

102
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:31,485
see you there.

103
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,796
Hey, Sam.

104
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,844
Sam. Are you okay?

105
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:42,979
No, I'm not okay.

106
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:45,334
I have no idea how to plan

107
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:47,551
a pregnant 15 year old's wedding.

108
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:50,386
- There's no guidebook. I checked.
- Well, it's a wedding.

109
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,214
It's not traditional, I know,

110
00:05:52,238 --> 00:05:54,550
but hopefully it's the
only one she'll have.

111
00:05:54,574 --> 00:05:58,945
- She... she just wants it to be special.
- No, what she wants is a fairy tale.

112
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:01,644
And to be honest, I'm not
feeling very happily ever after.

113
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:02,920
Well, find a balance.

114
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:04,676
You know, nice but not too big,

115
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,309
everything tasteful, elegant, but...

116
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:09,285
appropriate.

117
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:12,971
- What?
- You're hired.

118
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:15,721
- No, Sam...
- Look, Maya's gonna come over. She's gonna drop some stuff off.

119
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:18,147
You take a look at it, tell me
if you think it's appropriate.

120
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,207
Could you? Pl... Oh, thank you.

121
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:21,797
Thank you.

122
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,286
Paige...

123
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,560
Says you've had a fever
for a couple of days.

124
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,706
Doesn't seem to be affecting
your texting fingers.

125
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,355
- That's good.
- Sorry.

126
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:38,854
- How's the new school?
- It sucked for a while, eating alone every day.

127
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:41,504
But I have a lot of
friends now, so it's good.

128
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:43,169
Good. Friends are good.

129
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:45,538
You definitely have a fever.

130
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:49,576
And you look... a little yellowish.

131
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,408
Let's look at your glands.

132
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,077
I just need to take a look.

133
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:55,922
Okay.

134
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:56,972
Okay.

135
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:04,901
How'd you get that?

136
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:08,496
Um, I don't know. It
w... it was just there.

137
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,074
It looks like a bite.

138
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:13,006
You got a wild little
brother I don't know about?

139
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,371
It was probably my curling iron.

140
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:16,574
I've burnt myself with it before.

141
00:07:18,557 --> 00:07:21,147
Paige, did somebody bite you?

142
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:23,954
No. I'd know if someone bit me.

143
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,080
The nurse said she's coming to?

144
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:33,737
In and out. Her sats are low.

145
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:35,876
I was just adjusting her oxygen.

146
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:39,309
Lauren. Hey.

147
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,473
Your baby was born. It's a girl.

148
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:44,307
Her lungs are weak, but
she's hanging in there.

149
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,527
I'm still working on her, okay?

150
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:51,027
- The pressure... I can't breathe.
- Okay.

151
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:52,862
Hi, Lauren. I'm Dr. Bennett.

152
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,023
The reason you're feeling pressure

153
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,792
is because your heart isn't
pumping like it should.

154
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:59,517
We discovered a hole in
between your two ventricles.

155
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,841
As soon as you get
stronger, I'll do surgery.

156
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:04,358
- We can fix this.
- Is Michael here?

157
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:07,927
- Has... he seen the baby?
- We haven't found him yet.

158
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:10,080
The coast guard is still
searching the water.

159
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:12,366
Was... was he in a boat with you?

160
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,005
Is that what happened?

161
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:16,400
Lauren?

162
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:18,496
No.

163
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:20,454
He...

164
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:22,966
left.

165
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,690
He told me he didn't love me and he left.

166
00:08:26,403 --> 00:08:28,388
How did you end up in the water?

167
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:32,178
I thought that if I jumped,
the undertow would take me.

168
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:36,805
I wanted to die. You
shouldn't have saved me.

169
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:40,423
I w... I want to die.

170
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:50,137
I don't want to feel better.

171
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:53,687
I don't want surgery. I
don't want to be fixed.

172
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:58,749
What happened, Lauren?

173
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,773
W... what happened with
you and your husband?

174
00:09:05,522 --> 00:09:06,451
That's just it. I don't know.

175
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:09,691
We were gonna have a baby. It was fine.

176
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,556
And then I came home,
and there was this note...

177
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,174
a note...

178
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:17,142
saying that he left.

179
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,585
Most of his things were gone.

180
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:21,744
And I don't know why.

181
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:26,601
I waited for days for
him to come back or call.

182
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:29,437
I just felt empty.

183
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:32,565
I couldn't think. I couldn't breathe.

184
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:38,198
And I just wanted it to be over and done

185
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:41,600
so I wouldn't feel that anymore...

186
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,946
and I wouldn't be alone.

187
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:48,724
Well, you're... you're not alone anymore.

188
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:50,322
You have a baby upstairs.

189
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:52,494
And I almost killed her.

190
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,175
You can't force me to
have this surgery, can you?

191
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:03,772
Uh, well, I... I think we'd
all like you to want it.

192
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:05,414
Well, I don't.

193
00:10:05,844 --> 00:10:08,367
Just tell them that I refuse.

194
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:13,717
A human bite?

195
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:15,564
She's denying it, but
she's got teeth marks

196
00:10:15,588 --> 00:10:18,770
- and her liver's tender, she's got a yellowish pallor.
- Well, it's certainly a unique way

197
00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:21,272
to transmit hep b. And
if the test confirms it,

198
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:22,672
we're gonna have to find out who it is,

199
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:26,326
- 'cause they're sick, too, in more ways than one.
- You think it's, like, a sexual predator

200
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,304
who likes biting young
girls, he's got her scared?

201
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,330
Maybe it's abuse. What about her mother?

202
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:33,026
Mean, biting her? I doubt that.

203
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,082
Maybe it's some sort of s&m thing.

204
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:37,843
She's 13 years old.

205
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:40,126
Who goes around biting 13 year olds?

206
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,737
Try vampires.

207
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:44,487
- Funny.
- I'm serious.

208
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:47,596
Do you not live in America?
Do the words "Twilight"

209
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,510
- and "New Moon" mean nothing to you?
- They're... they're fictional.

210
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:52,041
Not to teenage girls who think

211
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:54,745
the bite of a vampire's
a sign of eternal love.

212
00:10:57,737 --> 00:10:59,625
How could you let some boy bite you?

213
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,592
I knew that you shouldn't be hanging out

214
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:04,347
- with that Amber and Ashley and what's her name.
-They didn't do anything.

215
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:07,365
You have hepatitis.
You're in the hospital.

216
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:08,911
You're 13 years old.

217
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,972
Paige, I think we're gonna need
to know the name of the boy,

218
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:14,574
because he may be sick, too.

219
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:19,382
- You'll tell 'em who it is, now.
- Angie. Angie.

220
00:11:20,368 --> 00:11:22,009
How could I have missed this?

221
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:24,721
Why don't you go and grab a cup of coffee,

222
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:28,166
and let us talk to her? Thanks. It's okay.

223
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:31,090
You don't understand.

224
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:32,554
He's my soul mate.

225
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:34,619
We're bound together for all of eternity.

226
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:37,337
- We love each other.
- Well, that's nice, but it shouldn't involve

227
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:39,232
- biting so hard that it draws blood.
- Yeah.

228
00:11:39,256 --> 00:11:41,893
It's just a sign of what
we are to each other.

229
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:45,467
And he's not sick, so you
don't need to do anything.

230
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:48,344
He might not be sick now,
but he's carrying the disease,

231
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:49,764
and it could be damaging his liver,

232
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:51,864
which is very serious.

233
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:53,965
If my mom knows who he is,

234
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:56,044
she'll never let me see him again.

235
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,661
So if I get him to come in,

236
00:11:57,685 --> 00:12:01,119
- will you promise not to tell my mom?
- W... she should know.

237
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:02,505
She can't.

238
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:06,939
So you promise... or I'm not telling.

239
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,018
- You can't promise not to tell.
- That kid bit her.

240
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:15,645
- He drew blood. He got her sick. Her labs are getting worse.
- I know, but it's her boyfriend,

241
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,173
and they were necking
in some perverse way.

242
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,550
It's sexual. It's not violent.

243
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:22,076
It's like any other consensual
sex act a minor tells us about.

244
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,722
We are bound...
doctor-patient confidentiality.

245
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:26,258
Your dating habits aside...

246
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:29,526
- sucking blood is not sex.
- Your lack of dating habits aside,

247
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,514
you heard what she said.

248
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:32,323
- She thinks she's in love...
- She's 13.

249
00:12:32,347 --> 00:12:34,409
Bottom line is, it's
sex. It's not violence.

250
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:36,716
We can't do anything about
it. I'll make her the promise.

251
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,684
We'll get the kid in here.
I'll see if he's sick.

252
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,236
We'll figure it out from there.

253
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:43,824
You know, we could always seal his coffin,

254
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:45,436
expose him to sunlight.

255
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:49,555
Without the surgery, she will die.

256
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:51,738
Which is why you have to 51-50
her. Not having the surgery

257
00:12:51,762 --> 00:12:54,936
- is just another way for her to attempt suicide.
- Well, legally and ethically speaking,

258
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,920
refusing treatment isn't the same at all.

259
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,944
And she's depressed. She's not crazy.

260
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:02,683
She tried to kill herself and
her baby. That's not crazy?

261
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:05,308
- No.
- So she tries to kill herself, fails,

262
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:08,185
- but gets close enough that she might actually get her wish?
- She agreed to try antidepressants.

263
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:10,800
That might help. Though I think
she probably only agreed to it

264
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:14,350
- 'cause she's hoping he'll change his mind and come back.
- Well, we can't wait for the antidepressants to work.

265
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:17,870
- She'll die. We have to force the surgery.
- No. Her depression makes that a bad idea.

266
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:20,048
It doubles her risk of dying on the table,

267
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:21,752
and it's dicey enough as it is.

268
00:13:24,075 --> 00:13:26,507
All right, then I'll...
I'll go find Michael,

269
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:30,183
- get him to come here.
- What, you think it's that easy to just make him love her?

270
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:32,028
His wife is dying. He has a baby.

271
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:34,098
There could've been a thousand
reasons why he walked away.

272
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:36,104
- I'm gonna go find him.
- Good luck trying to change his mind.

273
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:48,126
We've been calling, leaving messages.

274
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,356
I know. I got them.

275
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:53,751
Your wife and child are in the hospital.

276
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:55,801
Lauren's refusing to have a
surgery that could save her

277
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:56,713
because you're not there.

278
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:59,348
- She said you left out of the blue.
- Ou... out of the blue?

279
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:02,801
Look, this didn't just happen.

280
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:06,114
I tr... I tried to get
her to see for a long time.

281
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,546
She just didn't...

282
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,453
she didn't want to see it.
She didn't want to listen.

283
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:13,333
Then she got pregnant, and
I tried to make it work.

284
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:17,230
- But I just... I... I can't.
- What about the baby?

285
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:20,812
I never wanted a baby. She knew that.

286
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:25,573
And I... I... look, I tried to
be okay with that, but I'm not.

287
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:26,912
I don't love her anymore.

288
00:14:26,936 --> 00:14:28,903
Okay, Michael, look, can
you just be there for her,

289
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:33,164
- just for now, just until she's a little stronger?
- Look, I'll support the baby. I told her that.

290
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:36,608
But if I... if I go back,
she's just gonna do it again

291
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:39,608
the next time I go,
and I'll never get away.

292
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:51,331
Look, what I did to Paige,
it's not a bad thing.

293
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,125
It just signifies that
our souls are connected.

294
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:55,916
Yeah, but your viruses, too.

295
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,493
It's a health hazard.

296
00:14:57,517 --> 00:14:59,299
So I do need to know...

297
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,867
if you've done this biting
thing with any other girls.

298
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:05,341
- Of course not.
- I'm just asking, you know, doctor to patient, just us.

299
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:07,401
I don't mean to embarrass you.

300
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:09,865
Look, you may not understand this,

301
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,265
but...

302
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:13,957
We're destined for each other.

303
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:16,036
I would never betray that.

304
00:15:16,724 --> 00:15:19,490
I've walked this earth for 2,000 years,

305
00:15:19,514 --> 00:15:21,372
searching for her.

306
00:15:21,396 --> 00:15:24,012
Yeah.

307
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:26,147
Um, I've used a lot of lines in my day.

308
00:15:26,171 --> 00:15:29,060
- I'm not buying that one.
- Well, I'm not asking you to.

309
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:31,111
Okay, I'm gonna need to know
the names of all the girls

310
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:32,961
- that you've done this biting thing with.
- Paige told me. You can't tell anyone.

311
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:37,523
- No, but I can tell her what a little schmuck you are.
- And you think she'd believe you?

312
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:39,765
She and her friends love
all this vampire crap.

313
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:43,271
- Tell me who else you have bitten.
- No offense, but bite me.

314
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:52,079
- Hey.
- Hey.

315
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:53,776
- You have a minute?
- You okay?

316
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,635
Ugh. One of my patients

317
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:59,198
has hung her entire
life's happiness on a man.

318
00:15:59,222 --> 00:16:01,995
He's gone, and now she wants to die.

319
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:03,421
Well, she wouldn't be the first person.

320
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:05,800
Why do women let men do that to them,

321
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:07,827
let 'em get inside their
head and make 'em crazy?

322
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:10,652
And they make us feel really
good when it's... good,

323
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:12,831
and then... they make us want to

324
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:18,214
- curl up in a little ball and die when we can't have them.
- We are talking about your patient, right?

325
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:20,033
How's that speech going for tonight?

326
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:21,750
Oh, ugh. William White...

327
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:24,024
I mean, how do you write a
speech about a billionaire?

328
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:27,690
- You write about the man, not the money.
- Yeah, I know, but it is William White.

329
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:29,012
You know, that's a man

330
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:31,017
who could get into your
head and make you crazy.

331
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,099
- You know... you know what I think?
- William White?

332
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:36,589
William White?

333
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:37,984
No.

334
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:41,928
All right, there... there was a look.

335
00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:43,108
Uh-huh.

336
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:45,359
And a... moment.

337
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:48,128
- And he touched my hand.
- Oh! He likes you.

338
00:16:48,152 --> 00:16:49,459
Oh...

339
00:16:50,191 --> 00:16:52,266
All right, there was... there
was definitely something.

340
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,956
But I just...

341
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,809
I can't decide whether
it was exciting or...

342
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,083
Sexual harassment-y or...

343
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:02,482
All the more reason to
go tonight, to find out.

344
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:03,952
I mean, that's what these events are for.

345
00:17:03,976 --> 00:17:06,829
- And there's an open bar. I mean, you get drunk, get lucky.
- Yeah, but the idea of getting dressed up

346
00:17:06,853 --> 00:17:09,144
and... and pretending to enjoy myself

347
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:12,349
- with everything that's going on, it's just...
- Oh, come on. It'll be fun. We could both use it.

348
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:15,062
William White.

349
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:19,080
William White.

350
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:23,105
Hey. Your fever's down.

351
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:25,028
- That's good. How you feeling?
- Great.

352
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:27,059
Good. I told you Seth couldn't get sick.

353
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,792
He's too strong. I must have
gotten this some other way.

354
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:33,526
Okay, um, Paige, there's
no good way to say this,

355
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,852
so...

356
00:17:34,876 --> 00:17:37,233
he's been biting other girls.

357
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:39,930
It doesn't work that way.

358
00:17:39,954 --> 00:17:41,544
These other girls could get sick.

359
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:46,359
- He said they were your friends. We need to know who they are.
- Seth wouldn't do that.

360
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:48,634
- My friends wouldn't do that to me.
- Well, Paige, he...

361
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:49,872
- You don't get it.
- Paige...

362
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:52,065
Stop trying to turn
this into something bad.

363
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:59,472
Oh, I gotta admit, Sam, I'm lost.

364
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,419
This is all very pink.

365
00:18:02,443 --> 00:18:06,005
Yeah, she wants, uh... pink candy almonds

366
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:08,835
with "Maya and Dink
forever" stamped on them.

367
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:11,564
So I'm trying to find...

368
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:13,355
So I guess the, uh,

369
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:16,589
- the horse drawn carriage is out?
- Okay.

370
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:19,327
Wait. A hot air balloon...

371
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,550
those are her ideas.

372
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:26,051
Hey.

373
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:27,632
- Hey.
- Hi.

374
00:18:27,656 --> 00:18:29,209
Wow, wedding stuff, huh?

375
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,745
You need a hand?

376
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:32,486
Uh, no. We're good. We're good. Thanks.

377
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,049
What's up?

378
00:18:36,337 --> 00:18:38,036
I just wanted to talk to you about Lauren.

379
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,191
Did you talk to the husband?

380
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:42,798
Yeah, he doesn't want anything
to do with her or the baby.

381
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:47,118
- Do you want me to go with you to tell her?
- We can't.

382
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:48,746
What, you can't tell her?

383
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,394
You think it's better
to give her false hope

384
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:53,257
- that he's gonna show up?
- If it gets her into surgery, yeah.

385
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:55,461
Oh, good. All right.
So then we lie to her,

386
00:18:55,485 --> 00:19:00,562
- I fix her heart, then we break it again.
- But she'll be alive. Unless you have a better idea.

387
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:01,877
I mean, this way we have time

388
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:03,182
for the antidepressants to kick in.

389
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:05,572
I mean, maybe he'll change
his mind and come around.

390
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:08,081
Oh, do you really think
that's gonna happen, Addison?

391
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,673
You really think that she
should wait around for that?

392
00:19:13,547 --> 00:19:15,019
Violet, can you give us a few minutes?

393
00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:16,391
Yes.

394
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,560
Really, Sam?

395
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,437
You're gonna be this guy?

396
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:28,712
I tell you we can't be together,

397
00:19:28,736 --> 00:19:30,330
so you're gonna be the guy who punishes me

398
00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:34,287
- for doing the right thing?
- Oh, please. "The right thing"? You're afraid of Naomi.

399
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:35,360
I am not afraid of Naomi.

400
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:39,904
- I don't want to be a cheater again.
- We are two grown, single adults.

401
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,921
Please tell me how that is cheating.

402
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:44,569
Because I would be
betraying my best friend.

403
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:46,163
She's my ex-wife.

404
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:48,946
She does not get to decide
what happens between you and me.

405
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,692
She does not get to decide.

406
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:53,449
I decide. You decide. You're scared.

407
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:57,186
- I am not scared, Sam.
- You're scared because you know that this could be real.

408
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,723
Nothing's standing between us.

409
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:00,645
I'm not married. I don't live in Seattle.

410
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:03,359
This could be real, and you
don't know how to do real.

411
00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:04,964
N... no, no, that is not it.

412
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:07,421
This is about Naomi. She's my best friend.

413
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:11,033
- You divorced her, Sam. I'm not willing to do that.
- She... she would understand.

414
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:14,427
- If you were honest with her, she would get over it.
- Oh, what planet are you on?

415
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:16,317
Y... she won't even forgive her own child

416
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,863
for getting pregnant by accident.

417
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:19,948
You're planning a wedding by yourself.

418
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:22,465
You really think she's gonna forgive us?

419
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:25,041
So my ex-wife gets to dictate

420
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:26,924
who I can and can't sleep with?

421
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:29,239
Good. Great.

422
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:30,902
Perfect.

423
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:33,419
Sam, please...

424
00:20:43,348 --> 00:20:45,304
William White has shown us all

425
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,420
what can be achieved when
there is a strong will

426
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:50,372
backed by a kind heart

427
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:52,113
and deep pockets.

428
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:54,848
His generosity is...

429
00:20:54,872 --> 00:20:55,864
I love Naomi,

430
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,948
but is this speech gonna
end while I'm still young?

431
00:20:57,972 --> 00:20:59,685
I can't believe I'm here,

432
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:01,262
stomaching this about William White.

433
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:03,831
It's a fund-raiser for
the hospital, Charlotte,

434
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:07,567
- your hospital. - William remains
a small-town boy at heart...

435
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:10,779
Well, some things never change.

436
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,394
Cooper. 2:00.

437
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:15,123
Such a whore.

438
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,899
You okay?

439
00:21:18,923 --> 00:21:20,641
Not like I care.

440
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:23,136
Ladies and gentlemen,

441
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,851
our man of the year, Mr. William White.

442
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:36,277
Nice speech. Mm.

443
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:39,157
I'm gonna go work the room.

444
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:41,631
Our doctors are just not that much fun.

445
00:21:41,655 --> 00:21:42,990
- Tell me about it.
- Now have a drink

446
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:45,991
- and tell us what you really think about him.
- I meant what I said.

447
00:21:46,015 --> 00:21:48,984
Right, after he forced
me down your throat?

448
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,927
Uh, figuratively speaking.

449
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:52,505
Or maybe you've forgiven him

450
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:54,536
after you've realized I'm not so bad.

451
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,883
Admit it. I'm not so bad.

452
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:57,565
Hell of a speech.

453
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:00,956
I'm not sure I'm worthy. It was, um...

454
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,660
Thank you.

455
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:07,086
I heard what you're going through...

456
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,683
with your daughter.

457
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:12,174
- The assistants talk.
- Yeah. Um... well, I, uh,

458
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:14,830
I, uh, I just want you to know that it...

459
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:16,545
- It's not going to affect my work in any...
- I'm not worried about your work.

460
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,977
Okay. I'm worried about you.

461
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:21,384
Oh, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

462
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:22,383
Are you?

463
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,342
Yeah.

464
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,981
I am. I'm... I'm...

465
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:29,367
I'm...

466
00:22:31,365 --> 00:22:33,132
Well, you know, y...

467
00:22:33,726 --> 00:22:35,668
All right. You know what? I'm furious.

468
00:22:35,692 --> 00:22:37,666
And I'm on edge.

469
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,166
I'm uncomfortable in my skin,

470
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,732
and all I do is work all day.

471
00:22:41,756 --> 00:22:45,118
All I do is mix sperm and
ova into petri dishes all day.

472
00:22:45,142 --> 00:22:47,131
All I do is make babies for people

473
00:22:47,155 --> 00:22:49,282
who would do anything
to have a baby, you know,

474
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:51,186
people who are praying to have a baby.

475
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,016
And my stupid child goes
and makes one in an instant,

476
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,285
and I just kinda want to scream.

477
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,673
I want to scream because it's
just, like, it's crazy karma.

478
00:22:57,697 --> 00:23:01,616
And I, uh... and it's like
life spanking me in the face.

479
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,061
And I'm just trying to push through.

480
00:23:03,085 --> 00:23:05,434
And, you know, I'm just
eating too much cake

481
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,510
and doing as well as I can, you know?

482
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:09,952
And then you show up here
today, and... and you're my boss,

483
00:23:09,976 --> 00:23:11,832
and... and I think
you're flirting with me,

484
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:13,172
which is... because if
you're not flirting with me,

485
00:23:13,196 --> 00:23:16,012
then clearly I can add
delusional to my list of flaws,

486
00:23:16,036 --> 00:23:18,423
and, uh, also fired, because
I just said that out loud.

487
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:20,542
But I'm just spending
so much time these days

488
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,690
keeping my mouth shut and
not talking about things

489
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:24,534
and pretending that
things aren't happening,

490
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:26,328
and... and I just can't
do that anymore, you know?

491
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:27,656
'Cause I learned a long time ago

492
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,140
that in order to make speeches in public,

493
00:23:29,164 --> 00:23:30,226
sened up,

494
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,959
so I had to drink three martinis

495
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:33,692
before I could get up
there and make the speech,

496
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:35,381
and also two glasses
of wine, and so now...

497
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:37,180
I'm just a little loose right now.

498
00:23:37,204 --> 00:23:38,628
I'm just a little loose
and a little furious,

499
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:40,763
and, um, that's... that's kind
of where I started talking.

500
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:46,685
- So I'm... I'm gonna stop.
- Okay.

501
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:53,705
I don't know where to start. Um...

502
00:23:56,344 --> 00:23:58,260
First...

503
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:00,354
I'd be furious, too.

504
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,567
Second, I... I don't think it's karma.

505
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:05,582
I think it's just life.

506
00:24:05,606 --> 00:24:07,925
And third...

507
00:24:08,485 --> 00:24:10,397
I am flirting with you.

508
00:24:11,281 --> 00:24:12,948
You are?

509
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:15,716
Is that okay?

510
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:18,083
Uh...

511
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:19,574
Yeah.

512
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:22,922
Come on, let's dance.

513
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:26,561
Word is I'm pretty good on my feet.

514
00:24:33,816 --> 00:24:35,450
Cooper was just telling
us this great story

515
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,589
about this time when he was

516
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:38,061
- in Fort Lauderdale on spring break...
- Yeah.

517
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:40,331
And he got thrown into
jail for stealing a boat?

518
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,777
Yeah, well, you should get
him to tell you about the time

519
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:43,872
his mother caught him in his closet

520
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:47,630
- with an issue of "ladies' home journal"...
- Okay, okay, yeah. It's good seeing you.

521
00:24:49,243 --> 00:24:50,929
Oh. What?

522
00:24:50,953 --> 00:24:52,633
Did that help?

523
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,502
- A little.
- Okay.

524
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,139
Violet, you came.

525
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:00,790
Well, uh, I'm drinking fruity drinks

526
00:25:00,814 --> 00:25:02,242
with umbrellas in them.

527
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:07,432
- I... I would give you this one, but it's for Dell.
- Oh, that's good that he's here...

528
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:09,197
And you're here.

529
00:25:10,018 --> 00:25:12,275
You're done being mad at me, huh?

530
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:14,468
Yeah.

531
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:18,096
Thank you.

532
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:22,256
Forgiveness is... that...

533
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,547
- That's very big for me right now.
- Me, too.

534
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,614
You...

535
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,382
You know I'm still messed up, Pete.

536
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,027
I mean, I'm better.

537
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:34,264
But I'm... I'm not...

538
00:25:35,943 --> 00:25:37,944
- I mean, I... I can't...
- I know.

539
00:25:41,816 --> 00:25:43,299
Okay.

540
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:46,937
Well, I...

541
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:48,164
Yeah.

542
00:26:05,636 --> 00:26:07,805
Why does this suck so much?

543
00:26:08,548 --> 00:26:10,527
'Cause we're screwed up.

544
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:12,106
'Cause people have screwed with our lives,

545
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,312
and now we're... stuck.

546
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:19,553
You think they're having fun?

547
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:23,408
Maybe. Or maybe they're stuck, too.

548
00:26:23,432 --> 00:26:25,048
They're just better at hiding it.

549
00:26:25,072 --> 00:26:26,748
Yeah. Like Sam.

550
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,155
Sam is planning a wedding

551
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:30,507
for his pregnant
15-year-old daughter.

552
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:32,360
Naomi's pretending that's not happening.

553
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:35,640
Cooper and Charlotte are,
uh... well, they're too crazy

554
00:26:35,664 --> 00:26:37,390
to realize that they're
still in love with each other.

555
00:26:37,414 --> 00:26:39,162
And Addison... I... I don't know.

556
00:26:39,186 --> 00:26:44,168
- I don't know what's going on with Addison.
- Addison's, uh, uptight, twangy all the time.

557
00:26:44,192 --> 00:26:46,018
- She's rubber
band-y... - Yes.

558
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:47,403
- You know, like a rubber...
- Yes.

559
00:26:47,427 --> 00:26:48,835
Yeah. She's uptight and weird.

560
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,468
- Very... very weird. I don't know.
- And Pete...

561
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:57,326
Well... I guess that's all on me, huh?

562
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:03,817
I should probably take
this thing off, you know?

563
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:05,627
I mean, after everything Heather did,

564
00:27:05,651 --> 00:27:06,892
I should just take this thing off.

565
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,523
I should just take it off and pawn it.

566
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:12,861
I just want to move on.

567
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:16,447
Well, moving on's not that simple.

568
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,913
I mean, that ring connects
you to something good,

569
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,277
for you and for her and betsey.

570
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,525
To take it off is hard.

571
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,555
This is all hard.

572
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:32,601
I know.

573
00:27:58,723 --> 00:28:00,020
Having a good time?

574
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:02,228
Ugh. Like gum surgery.

575
00:28:02,252 --> 00:28:03,974
You want to tell me?

576
00:28:03,998 --> 00:28:07,514
No, because I always tell
you, and you always listen.

577
00:28:07,538 --> 00:28:08,701
And I don't want to be

578
00:28:08,725 --> 00:28:11,412
that girl who only
comes to you for whining.

579
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:13,069
Plus, it's complicated.

580
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:14,798
Oh, I'm so tired of complicated.

581
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:18,750
Why can't more things be... easy?

582
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:22,684
You know what the problem
is? We expect too much.

583
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:26,222
We just expect to be happy.
What gives us the right?

584
00:28:26,297 --> 00:28:27,310
You think?

585
00:28:27,334 --> 00:28:29,292
Well, either that or we try too hard.

586
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:31,936
I mean, I never wanted a kid. I got one.

587
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,627
I... I didn't try for it. I just got one.

588
00:28:35,651 --> 00:28:37,260
The best thing that ever happened to me.

589
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:40,337
So you think we find
happiness by accident?

590
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:41,905
Maybe.

591
00:28:42,613 --> 00:28:44,634
What if you find it and you can't have it?

592
00:28:44,658 --> 00:28:46,982
You're getting a little
close to home there.

593
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:48,832
Oh, sorry. Ugh.

594
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:50,961
What are we doing here?

595
00:28:50,985 --> 00:28:52,621
All I want to do is go home,

596
00:28:52,645 --> 00:28:54,959
kick off these incredibly painful shoes,

597
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,797
eat pizza and watch some really bad tv,

598
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,303
where people's lives are
more screwed up than mine.

599
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,237
Yeah.

600
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:06,926
Simply place the rhinestone or stud

601
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,173
in the slot...

602
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:11,447
push down and...

603
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:18,068
Do you think this is just
the depression talking?

604
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:20,419
I don't feel depressed right now. Do you?

605
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:21,891
No.

606
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,988
Wait. Wait.

607
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:28,998
Do you think it's the alcohol talking?

608
00:29:29,022 --> 00:29:30,350
I'm sober.

609
00:29:30,374 --> 00:29:32,126
I know. I kind of am, too.

610
00:29:35,247 --> 00:29:38,537
Okay, but we are definitely not doing it.

611
00:29:38,561 --> 00:29:40,232
Really?

612
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:41,878
Oh, we are so doing it.

613
00:29:41,902 --> 00:29:43,727
Get naked now.

614
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:49,085
Okay.

615
00:29:49,606 --> 00:29:51,604
That was fantastic.

616
00:29:51,628 --> 00:29:53,263
We're good.

617
00:29:53,287 --> 00:29:54,430
We're great. Yeah.

618
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:56,982
We... we have, like a... like a thing...

619
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:00,166
Like a you-and-me
thing with the sex.

620
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,672
I know. Ooh.

621
00:30:01,696 --> 00:30:03,376
We're like...

622
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,403
We're like olympians, gold medalists.

623
00:30:06,427 --> 00:30:08,893
Oh, ooh, wouldn't that be
good if that was a thing?

624
00:30:15,603 --> 00:30:17,741
There's something I have to tell you.

625
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:24,109
I'm still in love with Violet.

626
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,136
I think...

627
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:31,768
I'm in love with Sam.

628
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:53,110
Oh, yeah.

629
00:30:53,134 --> 00:30:55,611
- Had to humiliate me last night, huh?
- With what's her face?

630
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:56,773
Yes, what's her face,

631
00:30:56,797 --> 00:30:58,621
the perfectly nice woman I was talking to.

632
00:30:58,645 --> 00:31:02,120
- Talking?
- Yeah. You know what? I didn't throw her in your face.

633
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,625
We work together. This is gonna happen.

634
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:05,259
And we need a truce. We need a truce.

635
00:31:05,283 --> 00:31:07,331
- Otherwise, we're both gonna go crazy.
- And you think you could truce?

636
00:31:08,024 --> 00:31:11,171
Show of good faith.

637
00:31:11,195 --> 00:31:12,992
- You were right about the vampire.
- Of course I was.

638
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:15,274
I had to tell her her immortal
beloved was biting around.

639
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:19,089
- Nice. Break her poor little heart.
- Actually, no.

640
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:21,407
- She didn't believe me.
-She's 13 years old.

641
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:22,747
She wants to believe in the fairy tale

642
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:23,932
we've all been Fed as little girls

643
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:27,128
- about knights and princes and vampires.
- Last time I checked, vampires aren't from fairy tales.

644
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:30,935
They're from horror stories,
and this is health issue.

645
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:33,180
The bloodsucker must be stopped,

646
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:35,310
except Paige won't tell
me the names of her friends

647
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:38,096
- who have been biting ar...
- You really don't get women and heartbreak, Cooper.

648
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,801
This girl's about to get
smacked upside the head

649
00:31:39,825 --> 00:31:41,764
by the first real one of her life.

650
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:45,340
Why don't I talk to her?

651
00:31:45,364 --> 00:31:47,058
Pretty sure I know
where she's coming from.

652
00:31:53,032 --> 00:31:54,370
Hey.

653
00:31:55,098 --> 00:31:57,413
The baby's doing better.
Lung function's improving.

654
00:31:58,336 --> 00:31:59,927
Lauren is still refusing surgery.

655
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,155
Well, we know those medications
don't work overnight.

656
00:32:05,813 --> 00:32:07,745
So...

657
00:32:08,131 --> 00:32:09,670
you and Sam...

658
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:12,042
is there something the rest
of us should know about?

659
00:32:13,413 --> 00:32:15,336
Is there a problem with the practice?

660
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,664
Oh, no. No.

661
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:19,566
There's... there's not a problem, no.

662
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,331
I've never seen you two so hostile.

663
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:24,308
- Is it the wedding?
- It's nothing to worry about.

664
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:26,854
You know, I think I'm gonna
take the baby down to see Lauren,

665
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,893
show her that she has
something to live for.

666
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:31,657
- I... I wouldn't recommend that.
- Why not?

667
00:32:32,154 --> 00:32:34,553
I... depression isn't not understanding

668
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,242
that you have something to live for.

669
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:39,172
It's knowing that you
should feel differently,

670
00:32:39,196 --> 00:32:41,624
but it's so bad

671
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:43,901
that all you want to
do is curl up and die.

672
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:45,830
That's where she is.

673
00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:47,678
You think she doesn't understand

674
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:50,218
that she has a beautiful baby up here?

675
00:32:50,242 --> 00:32:52,634
So what do we do? We let her die?

676
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:55,490
We wait. We hope.

677
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,782
We keep trying.

678
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:02,819
I know how it is, Paige, honestly.

679
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:05,896
You love somebody. You want 'em
to love you back the same way.

680
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,368
You think love should
be magic and perfect.

681
00:33:08,392 --> 00:33:10,867
But real life isn't like that.

682
00:33:11,496 --> 00:33:12,603
You don't know him.

683
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:14,282
I know guys like him.

684
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:17,285
I know he's biting
other girls besides you.

685
00:33:18,045 --> 00:33:19,940
S... Seth would never lie to me.

686
00:33:21,361 --> 00:33:23,564
Men lie to us all the time.

687
00:33:23,588 --> 00:33:25,511
And we lie to them.

688
00:33:25,535 --> 00:33:28,516
Sometimes you do it to protect
yourself or the other person.

689
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,051
Sometimes it's how you
try to get what you want.

690
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:34,149
And sometimes it's just easier.

691
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:35,985
If you think love means
never lying to each other,

692
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:38,073
you're not ready for it.

693
00:33:38,097 --> 00:33:39,955
It's hard.

694
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:42,028
I know it is.

695
00:33:42,993 --> 00:33:45,829
You get bit. You think it's for life.

696
00:33:47,947 --> 00:33:50,114
When you find out it isn't, it hurts.

697
00:33:50,138 --> 00:33:51,943
It leaves a scar.

698
00:33:52,716 --> 00:33:56,162
But we need to figure out who
the other girls are, Paige.

699
00:33:56,186 --> 00:33:58,453
We can't help 'em if we
don't know who they are.

700
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,082
I don't want to be alone again.

701
00:34:04,774 --> 00:34:06,296
I know.

702
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:10,188
Hey.

703
00:34:10,828 --> 00:34:12,273
I need your advice, um...

704
00:34:13,372 --> 00:34:14,617
What, did somebody die?

705
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:16,559
Uh, nope. Getting married.

706
00:34:18,004 --> 00:34:19,641
I'm... I'm helping Sam.

707
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:23,951
I... I hope that's, uh...

708
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:27,723
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's... it's, um, it's good.

709
00:34:27,747 --> 00:34:30,183
I'm, you know, glad he's
not going through it alone.

710
00:34:33,402 --> 00:34:36,021
Um, that's... that's not
what the advice was about.

711
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:37,321
Um...

712
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:38,770
William?

713
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,759
I saw you two on the
dance floor last night.

714
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:43,347
Oh. Y... uh...

715
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:44,775
Well, um,

716
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:47,002
what... what... what exactly did you see?

717
00:34:47,513 --> 00:34:51,212
I saw my friend, who's been
going through a rough time,

718
00:34:51,236 --> 00:34:52,961
enjoying herself in the company

719
00:34:52,985 --> 00:34:55,065
of a charming, rich bachelor.

720
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:57,131
Do you like him?

721
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:01,419
I don't know.

722
00:35:01,443 --> 00:35:03,403
I mean, I'm flattered.

723
00:35:03,907 --> 00:35:05,987
- And I don't care about the rich.
- Doesn't hurt.

724
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:08,073
No, it doesn't hurt, but, uh...

725
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:10,041
I don't know.

726
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:11,847
I mean, I... I... I
thought he was one thing,

727
00:35:11,871 --> 00:35:15,808
and turns out maybe
he's, uh, more than that.

728
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:20,510
Then maybe that's what you need.

729
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,143
Oh, Naomi.

730
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,247
You can tell me to butt out, and I will.

731
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:33,838
But this wedding, it...

732
00:35:33,862 --> 00:35:35,874
look, it's all wrong.

733
00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:38,428
But it is only gonna happen once.

734
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:43,650
And I would hate to see
you stuck... on the outside.

735
00:35:45,448 --> 00:35:48,334
She's in pulmonary edema.

736
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:50,442
Lauren, Lauren, listen to me.

737
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:53,078
I found Michael, and he's not coming back.

738
00:35:53,102 --> 00:35:55,127
You have to face the truth.

739
00:35:55,151 --> 00:35:58,292
You want him and you can't have
him, and I know that's awful.

740
00:35:58,316 --> 00:36:00,610
Lauren, we all lose things that we love,

741
00:36:00,634 --> 00:36:04,031
- but we have to find a way to move on.
- I don't know if I'm strong enough.

742
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:08,330
Look, your baby fought
like hell to survive.

743
00:36:08,354 --> 00:36:11,753
She's one day old, and she found
the strength, and so can you.

744
00:36:11,777 --> 00:36:14,084
You have to do the surgery, Lauren, now.

745
00:36:15,846 --> 00:36:17,108
Okay.

746
00:36:17,132 --> 00:36:18,738
All right, I'll get a team to scrub in.

747
00:36:27,638 --> 00:36:30,004
There's someone here to see you.

748
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:41,206
Oh, I'm so sorry.

749
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:46,746
I'm sorry I hurt you.

750
00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:56,438
- Hey.
- Hey.

751
00:36:57,196 --> 00:36:58,096
You did good work.

752
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,016
Yeah, the... the repair went well.

753
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,920
I'm, uh, I'm happy for her.

754
00:37:02,694 --> 00:37:04,215
Sam...

755
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:06,676
Are we gonna get past this?

756
00:37:08,204 --> 00:37:09,763
I'm trying, Addison.

757
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:23,516
Hey.

758
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,227
Hey.

759
00:37:27,013 --> 00:37:29,205
I'm just, uh, picking out flowers

760
00:37:29,229 --> 00:37:30,826
and... linens.

761
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,485
Who... who knew that there were, like,

762
00:37:32,509 --> 00:37:34,488
ten different shades of pink?

763
00:37:46,905 --> 00:37:48,683
No more than 50 guests.

764
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,883
St. Mark's for the ceremony,

765
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:54,192
and afterwards, a small,
tasteful reception.

766
00:37:54,711 --> 00:37:56,794
Call Mark's Gardens for the flowers.

767
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:59,469
No taffeta or sequins anywhere.

768
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:01,710
Uh, Tasha at Renée Strauss
can pick out a dress

769
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:04,626
that is appropriate and
not ridiculously expensive.

770
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,127
Palisades catering can do a buffet.

771
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,448
And, uh...

772
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:11,197
sparkling cider instead of champagne,

773
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:12,770
seeing as the bride is pregnant and...

774
00:38:12,794 --> 00:38:15,520
the groom is underage.

775
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:19,261
Naomi...

776
00:38:19,285 --> 00:38:21,318
Uh, that's all I can do.

777
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:24,500
Okay? That's, uh, that's...
that's all I can do.

778
00:38:24,524 --> 00:38:26,348
Okay.

779
00:38:52,976 --> 00:38:54,895
I wish I could do that...

780
00:38:56,158 --> 00:39:01,302
Just some gesture that
would put me past all this.

781
00:39:01,326 --> 00:39:02,764
You could.

782
00:39:02,788 --> 00:39:04,403
I could.

783
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:09,979
But I can't.

784
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:25,931
Heading out?

785
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:27,669
Oh, yeah.

786
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:29,233
Uh, sorry.

787
00:39:29,257 --> 00:39:31,095
It's just been one of those days.

788
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,039
Well, maybe you should get
a glass of wine with me then.

789
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:37,287
Oh, I don't... I don't know. I...

790
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:40,086
Naomi, I really enjoyed last night,

791
00:39:40,496 --> 00:39:41,926
dancing with you.

792
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:45,496
Why are you interested in me?

793
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,196
I mean, what, why?

794
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,318
Well, I could give you
all the standard answers,

795
00:39:50,342 --> 00:39:54,190
like, you're beautiful, smart, funny,

796
00:39:54,214 --> 00:39:56,663
but that's just what people say.

797
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:57,879
Why?

798
00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:04,456
You make my heart beat faster.

799
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:09,616
You just... do.

800
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:14,780
Oh, g... I got problems, William.

801
00:40:14,804 --> 00:40:16,434
Don't we all?

802
00:40:19,104 --> 00:40:21,174
Well, I do like wine.

803
00:40:38,662 --> 00:40:40,824
Do you think we're ever gonna...

804
00:40:40,848 --> 00:40:41,973
What?

805
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,321
Not...

806
00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:49,727
be in love with other people?

807
00:40:50,757 --> 00:40:52,200
Who... Violet?

808
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,945
And Sam.

809
00:40:56,474 --> 00:40:58,113
I don't know.

810
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:01,502
Maybe this is okay.

811
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,597
Maybe this is better.

812
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:05,740
Love hurts.

813
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:08,613
But this... doesn't hurt.

814
00:41:08,637 --> 00:41:09,894
This feels like...

815
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:11,608
happiness.

816
00:41:11,632 --> 00:41:12,874
Yeah, yeah.
