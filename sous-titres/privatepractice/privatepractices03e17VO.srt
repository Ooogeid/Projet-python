1
00:00:12,867 --> 00:00:14,234
Okay, that looks dangerous.

2
00:00:14,268 --> 00:00:17,170
You're not allowed
to do that, ever. No, no.

3
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:19,940
your daddy won't
let you do anything stupid

4
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:22,376
Because you're too cute
to be in a cast.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,910
yes, you are.

6
00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:26,646
Oh, my god.
Isn't he the cutest thing?

7
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,083
What's your name?
(normal voice) lucas.

8
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,587
He looks just like you.
Oh, and you must be dad.

9
00:00:33,621 --> 00:00:36,757
He has your eyes,
but definitely mommy's smile.

10
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,692
Bye. Bye. 

11
00:00:38,726 --> 00:00:40,794
bye.

12
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:43,497
"mommy's smile."

13
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:47,300
Well, people see
what they want to see.

14
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:49,770
Uh, look, I gotta get
to the hospital.

15
00:00:49,804 --> 00:00:51,204
Oh, okay.

16
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,973
bye-bye.

17
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:54,674
Bye-bye.

18
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:05,652
Good morning.

19
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:07,154
Good morning.

20
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:10,090
I had this dream last night
about peaches.

21
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:12,025
I was thinking
it meant something.

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,895
You know, southern peaches
being...

23
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:16,430
I got it.

24
00:01:16,464 --> 00:01:18,331
I had a dream last night
about peaches.

25
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:20,100
Yeah, big,
succulent southern peaches

26
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:23,303
That went rotten and were all
filled with maggots.

27
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:25,305
Have any idea
what that means?

28
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:31,945
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.A.)</i>

29
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,314
Kayla, you're supposed
to be resting.

30
00:01:34,348 --> 00:01:37,184
Drew's report on afghanistan.
I told him I'd proof it.

31
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:40,153
(chuckles) junior high
was a lot easier when I went.

32
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:42,556
Maybe it's just that
I didn't care so much.

33
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,524
I was too interested
in boys.

34
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:47,194
(laughs)
well, really just eddie.
Is eddie here?

35
00:01:47,228 --> 00:01:50,630
No, he went home
to check on the kids.

36
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:52,999
But simon and angie--
they're getting a coffee.

37
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:54,935
Angie is freaking out
about the triplets.

38
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:57,037
But I keep checking
the monitor.

39
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:58,405
Heartbeats steady.

40
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,907
It's just me
that feels cruddy, right?
(knock on door)

41
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:02,576
How are they doing?

42
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,845
Ah, they are okay, but if you,
uh, could just give me

43
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,581
A couple of minutes alone
with kayla?
What is it?

44
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:09,449
Relax, honey.
Let's give 'em their space.

45
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:12,252
It's just, you know, I'm
so worried about our babies.

46
00:02:12,286 --> 00:02:14,788
It's okay.
They can stay.

47
00:02:14,822 --> 00:02:16,289
Okay, uh... Kayla,

48
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:19,192
I had a look at your
repeat scans this morning.

49
00:02:19,227 --> 00:02:22,596
And, uh, the blood clot's not
resolving. It's gotten worse.

50
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,898
So what do we do?
Angie, listen.

51
00:02:24,932 --> 00:02:27,100
I'm sorry.
The problem is that
the multiple pregnancies

52
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:30,403
Are putting too much pressure
on your veins.

53
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:33,240
So even with the heparin, you're
continuing to form new clots.

54
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:35,275
So what happens?
What do you do?

55
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:37,177
The pregnancy,
or the--the three fetuses,

56
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:39,546
Are just too much
for your body to handle.

57
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,648
So I need to
alleviate the pressure

58
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:43,083
As soon as possible.

59
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:44,918
The safest way to do that

60
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:46,920
Would be to reduce
the pregnancy to one.

61
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:48,855
so you're--
you're saying

62
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,358
You want to kill
two of my babies?

63
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:53,560
If she wasn't a surrogate,
if these were her babies,

64
00:02:53,594 --> 00:02:56,296
Would you be giving
the same advice?
Yes.

65
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,666
They're 20 weeks. A few more,
and they'll be viable.
Kayla doesn't have
a few more weeks.

66
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,769
If we wait, she could die.

Transcript by Addic7ed.com

68
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:13,713
Watching youtube again?

69
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:15,715
Actually, fife was just
bringing us up to date

70
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,617
On his
a.L.S. Antibiotic trial.

71
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:19,686
these preliminary
results are astounding.

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,189
I say we get the human trials up
and running, full steam ahead.
Outstanding.

73
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:25,125
I'll start to put together
a larger subject group.
(naomi) wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

74
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,494
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

75
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:29,396
The safety trials
and the dosing studies are good,

76
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,498
But we still need
to get approval

77
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:33,633
Before starting
phase iii trials.
That could take months.

78
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:35,635
There are patients out there
who need this now.

79
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,138
This is too important
to wait.
I seem to recall being asked
to be a moral compass here,

80
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:40,540
A check on the slippery slope
of science.

81
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:43,543
We're going downslope
too fast.
Tell you what,
I'll take you to dinner,

82
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:46,646
Lay out my protocol, the steps
I'd take. I'll win you over.

83
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:48,548
Actually,
I have dinner plans.

84
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,551
I would gladly sacrifice
r date in the name of science.
Now you can't say no.

85
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:53,186
It's settled.

86
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:58,658
Damn it.

87
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:01,728
I'll get it.
I'll get it.

88
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:05,765
Okay, I'm just gonna
clean this off

89
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,801
So I can get
a good look at it.

90
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:09,236
It shouldn't hurt.

91
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,371
Thank you so much
for squeezing us in.

92
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:14,674
Our pediatrician back home never
let anyone just squeeze in.

93
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,010
Well, you're in luck.
You're not gonna need stitches.

94
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:19,479
Just a few of these bandages
and some antibiotic ointment

95
00:04:19,513 --> 00:04:21,448
Will take good care of that.

96
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:23,483
You won't even have a scar.

97
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:26,119
Oh. You okay?

98
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:27,887
I am.

99
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:29,956
But eli doesn't believe you.

100
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:31,825
Eli?

101
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:33,927
Eli is, uh, maggie's friend.

102
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:35,595
She's got a great imagi.

103
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,098
Okay.
Well, not to worry, eli.

104
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:41,134
Uh, maggie will be
just fine. I promise.

105
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:45,572
He believes you.
He's just sad.

106
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:48,008
He thinks it was his fault.
Oh, why is that?

107
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:50,644
Eli kept saying that we should
make some new friends here...
Mm-hmm.

108
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:52,979
That he's tired
of just eating lunch with me.

109
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:54,447
He kept bugging me,

110
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:57,217
So I went over to these
two girls in my gym class,

111
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:58,685
And I introduced him.

112
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:00,987
But they were very rude.

113
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:03,023
You introduced eli?

114
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:07,794
It's always the smart kids
who get picked on, you know?

115
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:10,163
Hey, you got a minute?

116
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:11,731
Uh, sure.

117
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:14,067
Uh, I wouldn't bother you,
but with violet being gone--

118
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:16,403
You need a psych consult.
Yeah, I get it.

119
00:05:16,437 --> 00:05:17,837
Um, 11-year-old girl

120
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:20,340
Came in with an abrasion
on her forehead,

121
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:23,243
And then she had me talk
to her imaginary friend.

122
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:26,012
Seems a little old
for that.
Maybe. Maybe not.

123
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:29,182
You know, studies have shown
that children

124
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:31,618
With imaginary friends
excel academically.
At 11?

125
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:33,553
The girl just moved here.
She's scared, shy.

126
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:36,022
I'm worried that she's using
the imaginary friend

127
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:37,924
To ostracize herself.

128
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,794
Maybe she could use some help
figuring out how to fit in.

129
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:43,863
Sure. Sure. I have
a cancellation at, uh, 2:00.
(clicks keyboard keys)

130
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:45,432
Okay.

131
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:48,068
You know, this thing
with charlotte, I, uh...

132
00:05:48,102 --> 00:05:50,337
I don't want it to be
uncomfortable between us.

133
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:53,473
I mean, if there's a problem,
we should talk about it.

134
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:56,676
Sheldon, I know charlotte,
and she's, um...

135
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,978
Forget it.
No, no, no.
No, no. What? What?

136
00:05:59,013 --> 00:06:01,381
No, I--
no, no, no. What?
No, no. Come on. What?

137
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:03,783
Guy-to-guy, man-to-man?

138
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:07,153
She's using you, man.
She's using you to get to me.

139
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:09,622
And I hate watching he
yank your chain.

140
00:06:09,657 --> 00:06:13,426
We're having no problems
in the chain yanking department.
(laughs)

141
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:16,529
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe she likes me?

142
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:17,964
No.

143
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:23,136
I hate my life.
Join the club.

144
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,972
I'm about to terminate
two of three triplets

145
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:28,541
At 20 weeks.

146
00:06:28,576 --> 00:06:31,478
Oh, addie. I'm sorry.
Is there nothing you can do?

147
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:35,348
Nothing I can do.

148
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:37,217
So... 

149
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:39,519
Tell me why
you hate your life.

150
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:42,822
<i>Well, my current lover
wants me to go to dinner</i>

151
00:06:42,857 --> 00:06:45,658
<i>With the man who wants to be
future lover.</i>

152
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:48,661
I am a whore.
William's making you
go to dinner with fife?

153
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:50,096
Well...

154
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:53,099
It's not exactly
walking the streets, nai.

155
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:54,567
The--the two of them

156
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:56,603
Are ganging up on me
on this drug protocol.

157
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:59,539
Only with fife, it doesn't feel
like a drug protocol dinner.

158
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:02,041
It feels, uh... Dirty.

159
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:05,245
<i>You know, good dirty.
(laughs) but I--</i>

160
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,846
William is amazing.

161
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:09,115
Why can't I just be happy
with what I have?

162
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,985
A woman this morning
mistook me for lucas' mother.

163
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:15,121
Oh.
Nai, I don't want to be
a mother.

164
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:18,057
Yes, you do.
No, I don't want
to be a mother,

165
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:21,394
And I'm certainly not gonna
fall in love with pete's kid.
Yes, you are.

166
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:23,630
He's in love with violet.

167
00:07:23,664 --> 00:07:25,865
Yeah, well, violet--for many
reasons--is not available,

168
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,001
And you are,
and you like him.

169
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:29,869
I do... A lot.

170
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:32,772
So then is there any reason why
you and pete can't be together

171
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:35,408
And be happy and maybe be
a little family?

172
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:40,346
What?

173
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:41,714
Oh.

174
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:43,583
Is that the new girlfriend?

175
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:46,486
Yep. That's her.
He likes her.

176
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,721
Yep.
he likes her.

177
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:51,925
I'm happy he's happy.
here they come.

178
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:58,164
Hey, sam.
Addison. Vanessa, this is
dr. Naomi bennett, my ex-wife.

179
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,567
Hi. Pleasure.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

180
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:03,603
checking up on sam?
actually,
I'm here to see you.

181
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:07,006
About kayla lindy. I was asked
for a second opinion.

182
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,743
Kayla called you?
No. Uh, angie and simon did.

183
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:13,146
They think you're wrong.

184
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:18,557
Kayla, I know
what we're asking.

185
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:20,559
But we're asking.

186
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:23,328
She says it's safe.
And she says it isn't.

187
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:26,198
they've waited
so long for these babies.

188
00:08:26,232 --> 00:08:29,001
And we could use the money,
with the kids' college--

189
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:33,172
Baby, I don't care
about the money.
Kayla, I know what you want,
what you all want,

190
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:36,341
But you cannot
risk your life for this.
But these babies,

191
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:39,044
They're alive,
and we're so close.

192
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:40,646
They're not our babies.

193
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,348
Look, all due respect,
I can't lose my wife.

194
00:08:43,383 --> 00:08:44,817
We agreed to do this,

195
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:46,885
But we have a family of our own
to think about here.

196
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,688
All right. Let me reassure you,
we would get the best surgeon,

197
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:52,891
And I think this is an outcome
that will be good for everyone.

198
00:08:52,926 --> 00:08:55,027
(addison) I understand
what you're all weighing,

199
00:08:55,061 --> 00:08:57,463
But my concern is for kayla,
and my unequivocal opinion

200
00:08:57,497 --> 00:09:00,532
<i>Is that this is not
the right course.</i>

201
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:06,538
I just finished my meeting
with maggie,

202
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:09,108
And I think you're right
to be concerned.

203
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:11,543
She's ostracizing herself?
The problem's
bigger than that,

204
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:13,579
And it's not
a social problem.

205
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:15,147
I'm afraid
she's schizophrenic.

206
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,616
She's 11
with an imaginary friend.

207
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,185
That's ridiculous.
It's not that she has
a friend.

208
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,154
It's that she thinks
he's real.

209
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:24,223
I mean, an 11 year old
knows the difference

210
00:09:24,257 --> 00:09:26,225
Between what's real
and what isn't real.

211
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:29,194
And this girl, I mean, eli is
more real to her than you or me.

212
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:31,997
And she's isolating.
I'm seeing signs of paranoia.

213
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:34,967
She told me that eli
didn't trust you.
Don't you think
if she was schizophrenic,

214
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:38,070
Her parents would've seen
more signs?
Well, it's hard
for anyone to see it.

215
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:40,072
And she may be
just at the beginning,

216
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:42,274
Which is why we need
to address this fast.

217
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:45,344
I'm gonna prescribe
antipsychotics.
Whoa. Her brain
is still developing.

218
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:48,347
We have a window here.
She's going to hit puberty.

219
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:51,283
The odds are that this is
gonna be exponentially worse.

220
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,185
But when we start
these antipsychotics early,

221
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:55,254
About 20% of these kids
are able to function

222
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:57,156
And have a fairly normal life.

223
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,325
Without it,
she doesn't have a chance.
She had a normal life.
She moved to a new town.

224
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,294
Now you're gonna put her
on a medication

225
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:04,763
That's gonna alter her brain
forever. It's too fast.

226
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:08,467
Maggie doesn't have a choice.
Eli is talking to her.

227
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:11,703
You came to me for help.
So let me help her.

228
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:18,844
Dr. Montgomery... I know
what you must think of me.

229
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:20,512
But I can't have children.

230
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:21,947
I wanted to.

231
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:24,683
I went through years
of vitamins and supplements,

232
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:27,853
I.V.F.,
miscarriage after miscarriage.

233
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:30,889
People who can't
have children...

234
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:32,224
There are other options.

235
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:35,194
<i>This is my other option.</i>

236
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:38,297
Those babies she's carrying...

237
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:40,065
I've already named them.

238
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:42,835
I've already bonded with them,
all of them.

239
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:45,871
And I know that you look at me
with judgmental eyes

240
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:49,575
When I push kayla
to keep going.

241
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:52,277
But she's my last chance.

242
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:54,613
I understand how you feel.
I do.

243
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:57,015
But I can't support this
because it's what I want

244
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,450
Or it's what you want.

245
00:10:58,484 --> 00:11:01,086
I have to do
what is right for kayla.

246
00:11:05,892 --> 00:11:07,693
Schizophrenia?

247
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:10,562
No.
Maggie's a good kid.

248
00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:13,699
She makes good grades.
She loves to read.

249
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:16,702
I mean, tell 'em about the types
of things that she paints.

250
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:19,705
Uh, the colors, the swirls--
it's beautiful.

251
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:22,407
This is not a condemnation
of youdaughter.

252
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:24,376
She has
a physiological disorder.

253
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,378
She invented a friend
to talk to.

254
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:29,815
She has trouble getting along
with other kids sometimes.

255
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:32,050
That doesn't make her crazy.

256
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:33,552
It makes her different.

257
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:36,521
It makes her smart.
It's a coping mechanism.

258
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:40,792
Isn't that
what you guys call it?
Yes, if she were doing this,
but she's not.

259
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:42,728
Eli is not her creation.

260
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:44,696
What do you think?

261
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:47,366
I think your daughter
is struggling with something,

262
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,334
And that's why I went
to dr. Wallace.

263
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:52,271
And he's the expert.
I know this isn't
what you want to hear.

264
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:55,073
But this is not about a social
adjustment after a move.

265
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:57,576
Your daughter
needs to be treated,

266
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,711
Because what you think of now
as her quirks

267
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:02,714
Could very rapidly
become destructive.
(man) no. They don't know
what they're talking about.

268
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:05,417
Joe, please--
no. You want
to call my daughter crazy

269
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:07,452
And lock her up somewhere?

270
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:10,389
No. I don't buy it.
Let's go.

271
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:13,759
mr. Roberts, please--
thank yofor your time.

272
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,801
I'm sorry.

273
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:38,650
You looking for something?

274
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:40,552
sorry.

275
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:43,055
It's an impressive collection
you have here.

276
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:44,990
Thanks. Is there something
you wanted?

277
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:46,925
You got me thinking
this morning,

278
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,227
At the discussion
of the a.L.S. Trials.

279
00:12:49,262 --> 00:12:51,129
I've read about
alternative treatments

280
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:53,765
Being used to slow the rate
of muscular deterioration.

281
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,500
Valine, leucine, isoleucine.

282
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:58,036
Good. You are up
on the literature.
The results are inconclusive.

283
00:12:58,071 --> 00:13:00,405
Would you be interested
in studying it furth

284
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,774
As an adjunct to fife's work?

285
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:05,344
One group gets his protocol,
one control group, of course,

286
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:07,446
And a third group
gets amino acids.

287
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,882
This... Came to you
this morning?

288
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,521
Looks like
I loosened it up for you.

289
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,423
Think about it, dr. Wilder.

290
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,293
I will think about it.

291
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:23,862
You want to shake on it?
I want you
to hold out your hand.

292
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:26,031
Why is that?
You couldn't hold the mug
this morning,

293
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:27,599
You couldn't open the jar now,

294
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:30,869
And you're here
asking for my help.

295
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:32,838
How long have you been sick?

296
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,342
I was diagnosed
eight years ago.

297
00:13:37,377 --> 00:13:41,213
It was in remission
till last spring.

298
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:44,750
I'm sorry.

299
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:46,184
Does naomi know?

300
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:49,154
No. I don't intend to let
whatever it is we have

301
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:50,489
Be colored by pity.

302
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:53,892
I'm enjoying it.
I think I'm entitled.
And what about her?

303
00:13:53,926 --> 00:13:56,561
I'd ask that you respect
my wishes. You're a doctor.

304
00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:59,464
You should understand,
it's up to the patient

305
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:03,135
To decide when and how
to disclose things like this.
I'm not your doctor.

306
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:05,103
No, but you work
by certain standards

307
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:07,139
Or naomi wouldn't have
hired you.

308
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:09,041
Think about the study, pete.

309
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:11,743
I can use
all the help I can get.

310
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:19,651
Forget everything
that's happened

311
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:21,520
Or hasn't happened
between us.

312
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:24,790
What I'm about to say to you
is strictly professional

313
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:26,858
As a physician
and your business partner.

314
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:27,893
Okay.

315
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:30,295
Your girlfriend sucks.

316
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:34,132
Is that your professional
and medical opinion?

317
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,534
She's interfering
with my patient,

318
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:37,202
Contradicting
my medical advice

319
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:40,305
And putting kayla's life
at risk.
Vanessa was asked
for a second opinion.

320
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,641
She's a very good doctor.
Not as good as I am.

321
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:46,011
What? You want me to pretend
that I'm not amazing?

322
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:48,647
Because we both know that I .
Look, just ask her to back off.

323
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:51,917
Well, I'm afraid
I can't do that.
Why not?

324
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:54,219
Because I'm doing
kayla's surgery.

325
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:02,068
Pushing through
to the inferior vena cava.

326
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:04,136
Nice. Should block
any clots from going higher.

327
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:06,605
<i>If they form
below the umbrella.
You can't let this go?</i>

328
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,942
It's my patient on the table,
so, no.
 guys.

329
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,278
he's good.
Yes.

330
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,146
I can imagine it's useful,

331
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,515
Having a practice with
all these different specialties.

332
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,485
You can rely on each other,
use each other.
Except for when they ignore
your medical advice

333
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,955
And do what their girlfriends
tell them to do.
(sam) okay,
I am delicately threading

334
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,857
A 10-millimeter
micromesh umbrella

335
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,259
Inside the largest vein
of this woman's body.

336
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,062
So either be quiet...

337
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,465
Or get the hell out.

338
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:41,173
You got it?
I got it.

339
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,042
He got it.

340
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,667
Enough!

341
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:54,914
To all good things.

342
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:02,388
Why are you smiling?

343
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,957
Uh, y-you surprise me.

344
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:08,093
I just figured you'd be
hammering me about a.L.S.

345
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,162
And urgency
and giving me the hard sell.

346
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,897
Fine. Here's the hard sell.

347
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:13,332
A.L.S. Ravages the body,

348
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,734
Patients are left unable
to breathe on their own,

349
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,670
And eventually suffocate
on their own fluids.

350
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,638
And to hold off
on finding a cure

351
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:22,575
To follow government guidelines
that are overly cautious

352
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,477
And stalled
by bureaucratic red tape?

353
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,745
It is beneath the quality
of everything we do.

354
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,714
Now let's get drunk.

355
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,584
So we're--we're--
we're done talking a.L.S.?

356
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,753
I hope so. Thamakes
for a lousy date.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is not a date.

357
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,223
Mm.
No, this is
a business dinner.

358
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,190
Really?

359
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,059
A hot guy on eight wheels

360
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,695
Sitting across
from a beautiful woman?

361
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,530
Feels like a date to me.

362
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,301
The surgery went okay,
you know,

363
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,237
But that vanessa is not nice.

364
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:52,738
I mean, maybe she's nice.

365
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,640
She's just wrong for sam,
you know?

366
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,409
(lucas babbling)
oh, he's... He's up?

367
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,778
I mean, "up" up?

368
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:01,714
Yeah, he's up.

369
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,582
Hey, listen,
if I told you something

370
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:06,719
And told you
you couldn't tell naomi--
I'd tell nai.
I tell her everything.

371
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,488
Well, you didn't tell her
about sam.

372
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,891
Yeah, well, that's different.
What's the thing?
I'm not telling you now.

373
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,226
And it's not a thing.
It's a concern.

374
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,165
Well...

375
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,602
You're not
spending the night?

376
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:27,172
No, no. He's up, and you're
gonna spend some time with him,

377
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,542
Some, you know...
Family time.

378
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,844
Are you freaked out
because that woman

379
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,712
Thought you were his mother?
No.

380
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:36,849
I-I thought it was funny.
Funny?

381
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,284
Yeah.

382
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,019
Addison, where do we stand?

383
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,887
Where do we stand?

384
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:44,290
You're. You're asking me
just like that?

385
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,959
Yeah, I'm asking you
just like that.

386
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:50,529
Well, um, you...
Are in love with violet.
Maybe I could be
in love with you.

387
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:53,999
Pete--
maybe we could be more than
just you talking incessantly

388
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,868
About sam and his girlfriend
and running off

389
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,737
In the middle of the night
because my baby spooks y.
That is not what's--

390
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:00,739
Well, it feels like what's...

391
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:03,008
I...

392
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:06,178
I can't have kids.
You have lucas.

393
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,748
It's just... I mean,
does that make sense?
No.

394
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:11,750
Couldn't this be
a good thing?

395
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:14,720
I have to go. I can't do this.
I can't...

396
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,555
We shouldn't do this.
Fine.

397
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,623
Fine.

398
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:27,433
What do you want, sheldon?
I need to ask you something.

399
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,502
Did you sleep with me...
To spite him?

400
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,038
That is a psychologically
valid question.

401
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:35,608
I slept with you
because you're a nice guy,

402
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,644
And you made me laugh,
and I was in the mood.

403
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,746
Now I realize,
you're as childish as he is.

404
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,448
Oh, ch--ow, ow.
Charlotte.

405
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,351
Charlotte, my--my nose is
bleeding and my eye is swollen.

406
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,320
I mean, I-is that what I get
for sleeping with you--

407
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,456
Two orgasms
and a bloody nose?

408
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,925
I mean, don't you think
I deserve something else,

409
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,562
You know, for the efforts?

410
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,736
Sam!

411
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:07,206
Sam!

412
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,444
It's after midnight.
What's going on?

413
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,580
You shouldn't have done
that surgery.

414
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:16,915
You knew I was against it.
Vanessa has
a different opinion.

415
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,384
Yeah? Well, she was wrong!

416
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,319
Addison, what--
what is this about?
Bad medicine.

417
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,722
Really? Because you're acting
like a crazy person.
Yeah? Well, maybe I am,
and maybe...

418
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:25,958
maybe
I don't like your girlfriend.

419
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,861
(normal voice) maybe I think
that she's wrong for you.

420
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,863
But you know what?
I am right about my patient.

421
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,297
That surgery was a mistake.

422
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,733
And you know what
the sad part is?

423
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:36,835
I'm not even gonna be able
to gloat about it,

424
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,505
Because it means something bad
for a pregnant woman.
Addison--

425
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,473
Pete and I
got in a fight.

426
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:44,476
He says that I talk about you
too much, so...

427
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:46,979
He says he thinks that...

428
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:49,882
He and I
could really be something.

429
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,623
What about you and vanessa?

430
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:00,826
You think you could...
Be something?

431
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,030
I don't know.

432
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,403
Well...

433
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,871
I'm gonna go.

434
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:14,206
Okay.

435
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,246
I can't have kids,
and pete's got lucas.

436
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,583
So that's a little scary.
Does that makes sense?

437
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,520
You bond with the baby.

438
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:31,356
If you break up,
you're devastad.

439
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,858
It makes sense.

440
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,263
I knew you'd get it.

441
00:21:50,703 --> 00:21:52,270
Hey, sheldon.

442
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:53,739
Addison.

443
00:21:53,773 --> 00:21:55,874
Coincidence,
us both here,

444
00:21:55,908 --> 00:21:57,642
Waiting for the elevator,
right?

445
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:09,988
I had a feeling.
Okay, there's pete
and the baby,

446
00:22:10,023 --> 00:22:12,891
And then there's sam,
who has vanessa.
I have an office.

447
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:15,160
Sheldon, focus. Am I stupid
or am I a bad person?

448
00:22:15,194 --> 00:22:18,030
Because there's this great guy
and he's got a great baby,

449
00:22:18,064 --> 00:22:20,532
And I really want the baby
and I want the guy--

450
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:23,168
I want to love the guy--
but what am I doing instead?

451
00:22:23,202 --> 00:22:25,170
I'm going crazy
over sam and vanessa,

452
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:27,105
Who I genuinely think
is not a bad person.

453
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,941
Although I do think that
she might be a bad doctor

454
00:22:29,976 --> 00:22:31,877
Because she disagrees with
a medical course of treatment

455
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:33,879
That I know to be correct.
But... Am I stupid?

456
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:36,348
'cause I have no right
to have feelings for sam.

457
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:38,650
I don't even want
to have feelings for sam.

458
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:40,519
He's naomi's ex-husband.
He's my friend.

459
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:44,022
What--what the hell
is wrong with me?
Do you like being with pete?

460
00:22:44,057 --> 00:22:45,924
Yes.
And do you like
to be with lucas?

461
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,660
Yes.
So you want to be with them,

462
00:22:48,694 --> 00:22:51,530
You just don't want
to be with them?
Beuse of sam.

463
00:22:51,564 --> 00:22:54,266
Say something shrink-y.
Look, if you come
to my office--

464
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,268
short, quick answers.
Please.

465
00:22:56,302 --> 00:22:59,304
okay.
Well, a-a few months ago,

466
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:02,240
U found out that your mother
was living a secret life,

467
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:04,142
Hiding her homosexuality
from you.

468
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:06,778
And because she was guarding
this secret, you feel like

469
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:09,047
You never really knew
or bonded with her.

470
00:23:09,082 --> 00:23:11,550
What does that have to do
with my feelings for pete,

471
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:13,685
The baby and sam?
Well, you might be
harboring feelings

472
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:15,554
About connecting with a child
as that causes you

473
00:23:15,588 --> 00:23:17,422
To place yourself
in a maternal role,

474
00:23:17,457 --> 00:23:20,826
Which could be raising feelis
of rejection for you.

475
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,528
As well, you likely project pete
into the role of your father,

476
00:23:23,563 --> 00:23:25,464
Sam into the role
of a forbidden connection,

477
00:23:25,498 --> 00:23:27,432
Which confuses your feelings
for either man.

478
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,134
It becomes hard to see past

479
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:31,002
The deep-rooted
psychosexual implications

480
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:33,638
Of what you're going through.
What?

481
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:36,842
You have mommy issues.
What do I do?

482
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:39,744
Well, since I know you're not
gonna come to my office

483
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:42,214
And since I also now know
that I don't like

484
00:23:42,248 --> 00:23:44,082
Being trapped between floors
with tall redheads...

485
00:23:44,117 --> 00:23:46,384
(chuckles) I'd say, um...
What?

486
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:48,386
You see the problem.
That's half the battle.

487
00:23:48,421 --> 00:23:50,355
It's up to you to choose...

488
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:53,058
To make the right choices,
to attempt to be happy,

489
00:23:53,092 --> 00:23:54,960
To be loved, to be whole...

490
00:23:54,994 --> 00:23:57,229
Without drama
and without hurting anyone.

491
00:23:57,263 --> 00:24:00,232
Yeah, but how do I do that?
Addison, I'm telling you...

492
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:04,436
It's time
to grow the hell up. Okay?

493
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,604
Okay

494
00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:07,739
Okay.

495
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:15,947
What happened to your eye?

496
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:21,119
Cyndy, hey.
Uh, come in.

497
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:23,054
Have a seat.

498
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:25,090
Please.
I'm glad you came back.

499
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,895
I'm sorry if yesterday,

500
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:33,598
You felt, um... Pushed.

501
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:36,535
No. I just, um...

502
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:39,371
I'm sorry. Your--your lip.
Are you--are you okay?

503
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:41,773
I had a basketball game.
It's a competitive league.

504
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:45,210
Did you bring maggie in?

505
00:24:45,244 --> 00:24:47,712
No. I...
I shouldn't even be here.

506
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:50,882
Joe doesn't know
that I came.

507
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:52,784
I used to think he was right.

508
00:24:52,818 --> 00:24:55,187
You know, she's just different
than the other kids.

509
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:58,823
But over the past year,
it's gotten worse.

510
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:00,992
Not just since the move.

511
00:25:01,027 --> 00:25:03,895
Even before.

512
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,065
I came home from...
Work once,

513
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:09,201
And I found her...

514
00:25:09,235 --> 00:25:10,569
Sitting on my bed,

515
00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:13,038
Just...  Star.

516
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:14,873
So I went and I made dinner

517
00:25:14,907 --> 00:25:19,077
And I did some laundry,
and...

518
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:24,015
When I came back
two hours later...

519
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,018
She hadn't moved an inch.

520
00:25:28,988 --> 00:25:30,889
She's slipping away from me.Um,

521
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:33,658
And joe refuses to see it.

522
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:35,927
But I'm there every day.

523
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,733
And I'm afraid
that dr. Wallace may be right.

524
00:25:44,337 --> 00:25:46,972
And I don't know
what to do.

525
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:52,377
You have a look
on your face.

526
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:54,012
Addison.

527
00:25:54,046 --> 00:25:56,781
We had... No, it wasn't
even really a fight.

528
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:58,650
I don't know what it was.

529
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,585
Pete, you know
what I'm gonna say.

530
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,621
Just give her
the benefit of the doubt.

531
00:26:02,655 --> 00:26:05,390
What? I'm biased.
She's my best friend.

532
00:26:05,424 --> 00:26:08,393
Good morning.
Hey, I thought you were out of
the office with meetings today.

533
00:26:08,427 --> 00:26:10,562
Well, I wanted to see you,
hear about last night.

534
00:26:10,596 --> 00:26:12,430
Make sure you didn't
hold a grudge

535
00:26:12,465 --> 00:26:15,300
For me sticking you
with fife.

536
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:18,803
He behaved himself, I hope.
Let's just say that he was,
um, persistent.

537
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:20,639
Well, good. Good.

538
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:23,108
I'll see you later.
Okay.

539
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:25,577
Dr. Wilder.

540
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:31,049
You like him.

541
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:34,185
William? Yeah.
Yeah, we're dating.

542
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,921
How well do you know him?

543
00:26:36,956 --> 00:26:40,292
Well enough. Why?

544
00:26:40,326 --> 00:26:42,661
Oh, no reason.
I was just wondering.

545
00:26:51,804 --> 00:26:53,271
Look...

546
00:26:53,306 --> 00:26:55,140
About last night...

547
00:26:57,543 --> 00:27:00,478
Did you talk to pete yet?
Not yet, no. I--

548
00:27:00,513 --> 00:27:02,580
Addie. I need to...

549
00:27:02,615 --> 00:27:04,716
Uh... What?

550
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,086
Uh, n--uh, sam and I were
just discussing a case.

551
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,454
Okay.

552
00:27:09,488 --> 00:27:12,390
Addie, I-I want to
talk to you about some, uh,

553
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:14,559
William/fife stuff, so...

554
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,227
Sure.

555
00:27:16,262 --> 00:27:17,662
Addison...

556
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:20,298
It's about kayla.

557
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,201
She--she was talking,

558
00:27:23,235 --> 00:27:25,870
Then she--she just, uh,
started gasping for air.

559
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:28,106
Looks like a small clot
moved into her lung.
I thought you said

560
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,508
You were able to block
the clots from moving.
I was.

561
00:27:30,543 --> 00:27:33,011
This means she's forming
other clots above the umbrella.

562
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:35,547
Is she gonna be okay?
I'm gonna remove the stress
on her system now.

563
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:38,483
Prep an o.R. I have to reduce
the pregnancy load.

564
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:42,620
You didn't answer my question.
Is she gonna be okay?
I'm gonna do
everything I can.

565
00:27:42,655 --> 00:27:45,156
Tell me more about eli.

566
00:27:45,191 --> 00:27:47,659
What kind of things
do you two do together?

567
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:48,993
Lots of stuff.

568
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:51,262
<i>Sometimes eli wants to play
on the computer</i>

569
00:27:51,297 --> 00:27:53,465
<i>And sometimes we go for hikes.
I don't like this.</i>

570
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:56,401
We should be in there
with her.
Just let him talk to her.

571
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:59,304
<i>(sheldon) do you go
with other friends?
He's gonna get her confused,</i>

572
00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:01,706
Make her say
what he wants us to hear.
No, no.
No one has an agenda.

573
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:04,442
<i>We're just trying
to help your daughter.
Well, that sounds like fun.</i>

574
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:06,678
Most of the time.

575
00:28:06,712 --> 00:28:08,847
What about the other times?

576
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:12,417
I don't know.

577
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:15,186
Is it stuff
you don't like to do?

578
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:18,857
Who gets to decide
what you do?

579
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:21,025
Eli.

580
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,528
I try not to listen,
but...

581
00:28:23,562 --> 00:28:25,797
He doesn't like it
when I ignore him.

582
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:28,466
What things does eli say?

583
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:34,672
Is he talking to you now?

584
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:36,374
He's angry.

585
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:39,277
He doesn't want me to tell you
about the bad stuff.

586
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:41,846
Maggie, I know this is hard.

587
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:45,784
But you can tell me.
I won't let him hurt you.

588
00:28:49,088 --> 00:28:52,023
Eli didn't like me
spending time with munchie.

589
00:28:52,057 --> 00:28:53,691
Who's munchie?

590
00:28:53,726 --> 00:28:55,760
My cat.

591
00:28:55,795 --> 00:28:58,596
Eli was jealous.

592
00:28:58,631 --> 00:29:01,499
He wanted munchie
to go away.

593
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,206
He told me that munchie wanted
to go into the lake.

594
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,075
So I took him to the one
behind our house.

595
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,546
And then he told me
to just hold him there,

596
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,548
<i>Underwater.</i>

597
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:21,352
<i>And he fought,
and he scratched...</i>

598
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:25,123
but I did
what eli told me...

599
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,426
Until...

600
00:29:31,397 --> 00:29:33,231
He stopped moving.

601
00:29:33,265 --> 00:29:36,468
Oh, my god.
I thought it ran away.
She's upset.

602
00:29:36,502 --> 00:29:39,671
He is upsetting her.
I want this stopped now!

603
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:42,674
Joe, this isn't gonna stop,
not unless we help her.

604
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:46,010
I am not locking up my daughter.
I want this stopped!

605
00:30:00,991 --> 00:30:03,960
I wanted to help them.
I believed I was right.

606
00:30:03,994 --> 00:30:06,196
So please spare me
the condescending

607
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,865
"we all make bad calls" speech.
I've heard it before.
That's not
what I was gonna say.

608
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:10,533
I was gonna say
that you screwed up.

609
00:30:10,568 --> 00:30:13,303
You screwed up royally, and now
I have to clean up your mess.

610
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:15,705
So you can scrub in with me
if you want,

611
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:18,741
But in my o.R., you will shut up
and do as your told.
Okay, that felt personal.

612
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:22,278
It wasn't.
Are you really mad at me
or sam?

613
00:30:22,313 --> 00:30:24,247
Maybe before I was
really mad at sam.

614
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,216
But now that
my patient might die

615
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,684
Because of your bad call,

616
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:30,320
I'm really mad at you.

617
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:37,560
And how are you
on this fine day, dr. Wilder?

618
00:30:37,595 --> 00:30:39,496
Let me ask you a question.

619
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,598
Before yesterday, before...

620
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:44,033
William gave you
the green light,

621
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:47,036
Were you gonna proceedmore caut?
This is not me
being reckless.

622
00:30:47,071 --> 00:30:49,272
The man who signs our paychecks
is comfortable

623
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:51,374
There are no issues here.

624
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,912
If you knew that william
had his own agenda

625
00:30:55,946 --> 00:30:58,014
That had nothing to do
with yours

626
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,983
And that's why he has you
moving fast,

627
00:31:00,017 --> 00:31:02,785
Would that change anything?
What agenda?

628
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,755
Just do it right, okay?

629
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:08,224
What agenda?

630
00:31:10,194 --> 00:31:13,963
He needs the treatment
for himself.

631
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:20,970
(taps fingers)
does naomi know?

632
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:24,274
No.
Why are you telling me this?

633
00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:26,276
Because this should be
done right.

634
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,677
Whatever your agenda is,

635
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:30,713
I'm counting on you
to do the right thing.

636
00:31:34,552 --> 00:31:36,419
you're angry.

637
00:31:36,453 --> 00:31:38,321
You're angry at me,
and I'm sorry.

638
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,957
But I also see
that you're scared.
I am not scared.

639
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:43,626
Seeing this happen
to a child you love is scary,

640
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:46,596
And knowing what someone
you love is capable of is scary.

641
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,131
What's scary is you.

642
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:50,600
You want to lock up
a little girl,

643
00:31:50,634 --> 00:31:53,803
Take her away from us
a-and make her different.

644
00:31:53,837 --> 00:31:57,407
No one is talking about
taking her away.
Yeah, that's what
you say now.

645
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:01,744
And thenand you don't let usr
and yosee her again.

646
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:04,514
And I won't allow that.
No, I won't!
Joe--

647
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,715
No!

648
00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:07,850
Who did they take away
from you, joe?

649
00:32:09,787 --> 00:32:12,021
Joe?

650
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,826
My sister.

651
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,896
But I... I thought
your sister died.

652
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,966
Joe, what happened
to your sister?

653
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,603
She started, uh,
hearing voices.

654
00:32:26,637 --> 00:32:29,138
God was talking to her.

655
00:32:29,173 --> 00:32:31,507
My parents took her
to the doctors.

656
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:33,810
And... They took her away.

657
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:36,746
They locked her up
and they called her crazy,

658
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,648
And she killed herself.

659
00:32:40,284 --> 00:32:42,418
Oh, honey.

660
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:44,354
Why didn't you tell me?

661
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:46,256
Because it's my fault
that maggie's sick.

662
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,559
It's in my family.
It's in my blood.

663
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,061
And if they'd
just let her be,

664
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,763
It would've been fine.

665
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:57,567
I'm sorry for what happened.

666
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,736
But treatment has evolved.

667
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,171
They don't just lock up
people with this disease

668
00:33:02,206 --> 00:33:03,606
And throw away the key.

669
00:33:03,641 --> 00:33:05,775
We can find medications
and work therapeutically,

670
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:07,710
And you'll be right there
with her

671
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:10,079
Every step of the way.
you can't ignore it.

672
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:12,015
You can't pretend
it's not happening.

673
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:14,450
If you accept it,
it can get better.

674
00:33:14,485 --> 00:33:16,853
She can get better.

675
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,661
Spinal needle and k.C.L.
Adjusting the probe.

676
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:26,996
pulse ox is 86.

677
00:33:27,031 --> 00:33:29,299
She's throwing p.V.C.S.
She's throwing another clot,
a big one.

678
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,567
All right.
Raise the oxygen to 100.

679
00:33:31,602 --> 00:33:33,336
We need to get her
off the table, into I.C.U.

680
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,171
I've lost her pulse.
She's in fib. Crash cart.

681
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:42,045
Uh, I wanted to talk to you
about the drug protocol.

682
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,347
I was just thinking
about that, actually.

683
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:48,651
I was, um, I was just sitting
here thinking about maya.

684
00:33:48,686 --> 00:33:50,586
And I was thinking about
what you said,

685
00:33:50,621 --> 00:33:52,922
About how horrible
this disease is

686
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:56,826
And how could I
let someone suffer.

687
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,163
And if that were somebody
that I loved...

688
00:34:00,197 --> 00:34:03,333
I looked over your protocol
top to bottom,

689
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:05,401
And it looks good.

690
00:34:05,436 --> 00:34:08,905
So if you and william
are okay with it,

691
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:10,473
I'm in.

692
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,478
I thought you'd be
appreciative.

693
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:16,913
I am, uh, but, uh,

694
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:18,915
I also considered
your argument.

695
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:21,150
And while I appreciate
the green light,

696
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:24,053
I-I don't know that whatwi,

697
00:34:24,088 --> 00:34:26,989
U-unless we do this...
The right way.

698
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:31,160
Get the proper approvals,
make sure.

699
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:34,731
What can I say?
You're rubbing off on me.

700
00:34:34,765 --> 00:34:36,332
Gabriel...

701
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:38,134
Wait.

702
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:40,336
What?

703
00:34:45,442 --> 00:34:47,744
Can you raise the chair?

704
00:34:52,516 --> 00:34:54,917
Higher.

705
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:05,194
Will you..

706
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,666
Okay.

707
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:12,602
What?

708
00:35:12,636 --> 00:35:15,171
Uh, I...

709
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:17,240
Just, um...

710
00:35:17,274 --> 00:35:19,709
I, uh...

711
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:43,032
Is she okay?

712
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:46,869
Tell me she's okay.

713
00:35:46,904 --> 00:35:49,439
Eddie, uh...

714
00:35:49,473 --> 00:35:52,475
The clot went into her lung,
and her heart stopped.

715
00:35:52,509 --> 00:35:56,012
It took us five minutes
to get it started beating again.

716
00:35:56,046 --> 00:35:58,414
But her brain
was without oxygen.

717
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:02,852
There's no evidence
of higher level brain activity.

718
00:36:02,886 --> 00:36:04,987
I'm sorry.

719
00:36:05,022 --> 00:36:07,557
sh-she's dead?

720
00:36:07,591 --> 00:36:10,126
She's in a coma
on life support.

721
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,762
I'm so sorry, eddie.

722
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,131
And the baby...

723
00:36:15,165 --> 00:36:17,667
The one that's left?

724
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:19,602
We never
got to the procedure.

725
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,905
All three babies,
they're stable.
What...

726
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,174
What does that mean?

727
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:28,144
It means that so long
as kayla is on the ventilator,

728
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:31,514
The babies
will continue to grow.
she said...

729
00:36:31,548 --> 00:36:33,549
She said
this was too dangerous.

730
00:36:33,584 --> 00:36:37,019
She said that kayla could die,
and--and you talked her into it.

731
00:36:37,054 --> 00:36:39,889
You said she would be okay.
I'm sorry.

732
00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:41,924
No, you--you killed her.

733
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,326
You killed my wife.

734
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,262
<i>You killed my wife!</i>

735
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:32,348
I, uh, owe you an apology.

736
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:35,718
Some things are hard
to accept, right? I get that.

737
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,221
You know, before yesterday,
I never struck another person.

738
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:40,023
Oh, yeah?

739
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,292
Well, not a bad right cross
for a shrink.

740
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,461
Thank you.

741
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:06,916
Pete.

742
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,618
I'll be right in.

743
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,524
I'm tired of making
the wrong choices.

744
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,925
I've done thatoo much.

745
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:17,860
I want to make
the right choice.

746
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:20,096
What are you saying?

747
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,866
Maybe I could be
in love with you, too.

748
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:26,969
Yeah?

749
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,905
Yeah.

750
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:36,879
I wanted to apologize
for last night.

751
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,015
It was juvenile.
I was juvenile.

752
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:42,085
And I could lie and blame it
on endorphins from a fight.

753
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,352
But... 

754
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,789
It was just me being stupid
and insecure.

755
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,792
I mean, you know, a beautiful
woman like you, I wasn't sure--

756
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,360
Sheldon.
Yeah.

757
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,496
Shut up.

758
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,442
I heard about kayla.

759
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,511
You okay?

760
00:39:08,545 --> 00:39:10,146
This is me, gloating.

761
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:22,859
I'm sorry.

762
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,094
Me, too.

763
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:28,131
I really am, sam.

764
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,600
Being right
is all well and good,

765
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:34,971
But it's not... Much fun.

766
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,206
How's vanessa?

767
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,275
She's all right.

768
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:41,177
Good.

769
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,682
She made a bad call.
Yeah. We all make bad calls.

770
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:52,221
You and I
were a bad call.

771
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:55,057
yeah.

772
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:01,097
Talked to pete.

773
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,868
Did you tell him that you
wanted to be with him?

774
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,870
Yeah, I'm just...
We're just gonna try,

775
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,540
You know, we're gonna
see if it works...

776
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,475
Attempt to be happy.

777
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:14,443
That's good.

778
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:18,881
I'm trying
to grow the hell up, sam.

779
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:23,219
I want you to be happy.

780
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:25,188
I want you
to be happy, too.

781
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:35,264
Addison.

782
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,670
I was coming up here to...

783
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,638
Tell you what happened
to me today,

784
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:45,875
But it seems like all
the real action is up here.

785
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:48,744
No, no. Nai, not at all.
Nothing ever happened.

786
00:40:51,548 --> 00:40:54,851
We...

787
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,720
We kissed, nai,
but you have to believe me

788
00:40:57,754 --> 00:41:00,456
When I tell...

789
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,326
Shame on you.
