1
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,100
Job Interview?

2
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,600
I Forgot How Much Fun
Irresponsibility Is.

3
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,800
Right?

4
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,900
I Love Irresponsibility.
Mm-Hmm.

5
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,800
Mom.

6
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,900
Dad?

7
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,000
Are You
Getting Back Together?

8
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,900
Yeah.

9
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,200
Absolutely.

10
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,000
Uh-Huh.
Yes.

11
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,300
We're--Yeah.

12
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,400
You Should've Seen
Maya's Face, Man.

13
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,900
It Was Like Christmas,
New Puppy, First Car

14
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,000
All Rolled Into One.
What Was I Supposed To Say?

15
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,300
Are You And Naomi Ready
To Get Back Together?

16
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,900
I Mean, I Just Got Single.
I Haven't Sown Any Oats.

17
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,900
I Can't Get Over The Feeling
That I'm--I'm Missing Something.
Like?

18
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,800
Like An Ex-Lover Jetting In

19
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,000
And Making Me
Look Like This One.
No, Love, Companionship,

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
That Is Not A Step Backwards,
That's A Step Forwards.

21
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
It's Like
Taking Off The Condom,

22
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,500
And Taking Off The Condom
Is Good.

23
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,800
Metaphorically.

24
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,500
So You Can Do That,
Let Go Of The Betrayal,

25
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,400
Everything
He Put You Through?

26
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,700
Yeah, Well, You Know,
We Both Played Our Part.

27
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,600
But I Don't Know. Now It
Just--It Just Feels Right.

28
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,200
We're Sam And Naomi.

29
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,800
Sam And Naomi,
Together Again.
Yeah.

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,500
You And Sam,
You're Getting Back Together?

31
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,200
Nai, That's... That's Great.
That's Amazing.

32
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,800
Thank You.

33
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,700
So I-I Hear, Uh,

34
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,100
The Mean, New Boss Lady
Is Calling A Morning Meeting.

35
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,900
Oh, Now. She's Not That Bad
Once You Get To Know Her.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
$487,000.

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,800
What Does That Mean?

38
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,700
That's How Much We Need
To Keep The Doors Open.
And You Have A Plan?

39
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,000
A Plan That Doesn't Change

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,200
What The Practice
Is Supposed To Be?
I Do, Actually.

41
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,000
Starting Monday, Our Doors
Will Open One Hour Earlier,

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,800
And We Will Close
One Hour Later.

43
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,500
We Will Also
Be Working Weekends...

44
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Saturdays From 9:00 To 1:00--
Um, I Have A...

45
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,500
S-S-Sure.

46
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,000
And In Addition,
I Will Be Asking Each Of You

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
To Take On
Extra Responsibilities

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,300
To Help Generate Income.
What About Me?

49
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,200
You Will Be Working With Me
To Find The Extra Money.

50
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,500
Pete, We Have To Go.
It's Jenna's Day.

51
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,300
Jenna's Day.
That's Today?

52
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,100
Oh, My God.
It's Jenna's Day.
Wow. Jenna.

53
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,900
Jenna?

54
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,900
Tell Her I Said Hi.

55
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,700
Who--Who's Jenna?

56
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,800
Saved The Practice.

57
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,700
You're Welcome.

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,500
Hey, Can You Set Up
Two Blood Draw Kits For Me

59
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,200
For This Afternoon?
Sure.

60
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,000
That's A Whole Lot
Of Condoms.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,100
Planned Parenthood.

62
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,200
Addison's Helping
With Their Community Outreach,

63
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,700
And They're Free.
Go Ahead, Cooper.
Line Your Pockets.

64
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,000
No, I'm Good.
Oh, You're Good With Condoms?

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,800
Yeah.

66
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,100
So It's Over...
Between You And Charlotte?

67
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm Sorry.
What? No.

68
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,200
What?

69
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,800
Oh. <I>Oh.</I> You're Being...

70
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,300
Monogamous?

71
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,300
You're Being Serious
With Charlotte? Really?

72
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,800
Charlotte?
Yeah.

73
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,400
Here's The Part
Where You Say,

74
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,100
"Congratulations, Cooper.
I'm Happy For You."

75
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,500
Uh, I Have To Go.

76
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
An Old Friend Is
In From Out Of Town--

77
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,000
A Really, Uh,
Really Good Friend.

78
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,200
Okay, Jenna, I Am Aspirating
The Follicular Fluid.

79
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,100
So Tell Us About
The Wedding.

80
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,800
You Have A White Dress
And A Big Cake?
Yeah, Strawberry.

81
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,600
Oh.
Look At My Wedding Ring.
It's A Karat...

82
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,100
Wow.
A Whole Karat.

83
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,500
It Was Her Grandmother's.

84
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,400
Oh, Please Tell Me
You Brought Pictures.

85
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,000
Now We Need To See
The Pictures.
I Have The Album In The Car.

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,400
I Will Bring It Up.
It Was The Most Amazing Day
Of My Life...

87
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,300
Until Now.

88
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,000
And I Am Done.
You're Done?
You Got My Eggs?

89
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Uh-Huh.
(Pete) Hey, Nick.

90
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
(Nick) Hey, Guys.
Hey, Nick.

91
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,400
Hi, Sweetie.

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,700
I'm Sorry.
Practice Ran Late.

93
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,200
Hi. She Got My Eggs, Nick.

94
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,900
Wow.
It's Really Happening.

95
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,600
How'd She Do?
She's A Trooper.

96
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, Great.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,600
What's Going On?
Egg Retrieval.

98
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,000
Is There An Office Pool
On How Many Eggs We'll Get?

99
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,600
No, It's Jenna.

100
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,300
That's Jenna?
(Cooper) Yeah, We've Known Her
And Her Family A Long Time.

101
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,900
How Old Is She?
All Right. 17.

102
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,100
Wh--Uh, Why Are We
Doing Egg Retrieval

103
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,100
On A 17 Year Old?

104
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
Because She's Dying.

105
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,700
And We're Giving Her
Her Last Wish--A Baby.

106
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,800
(Laughs) Oh, Look At You.
Oh.

107
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,300
Look At You. Assistant D.A.
Wasn't Impressive Enough?

108
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,700
You Had To Run For Congress.
You Big Show-Off.

109
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,900
(Laughs) Oh.
It's So Good To See You.

110
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,300
Is Everything Okay?
Yeah, The Campaign's
Going Well.

111
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,700
I'm Up In The Polls.

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,900
So The Other Side Wants To
Bring Me Down, You Know?

113
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,700
They're, Uh, Calling
My Law Professors

114
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,800
And Ex-Boyfriends.

115
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,300
No One's Called You,
Have They?

116
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,300
No. And Even If They Did,
You're Safe With Me.

117
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,000
We've Always Had
Each Other's Backs, Right?

118
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,900
Through Good And Bad.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,400
I Need Help, Vi.

120
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,300
Okay. Well, If Things
Are Tough Again,

121
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,600
Then I Recommend Someone,
A Therapist, Discreet.

122
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,900
Not That.
Well, Tell Me. Anything.

123
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,600
I Need You To Destroy
My Medical Records.

You Kidding?

128
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,300
You Know, My Mother
Had Just Died, And You--
Yeah.

129
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,100
Well, Yeah, I Never Told You,
But... (Sighs)

130
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,700
Christmas Break...

131
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
I Admitted Myself
To St. Ambrose.

132
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,200
I Had Shock Therapy.

133
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,600
Why Didn't You Tell Me?

134
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,400
We Poured Our Souls Out
To Each Other.
Well, I Was Too Embarrassed,

135
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,600
And I Just Couldn't.

136
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,000
But Now...
You See My Problem.

137
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,700
Shock Therapy
Is Not A Big Deal.

138
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,500
Oh, Well,
Maybe Not To You,

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But Voters Won't See It
That Way.

140
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,200
Everyone's Seen
"Cuckoo's Nest."

141
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,400
Shock Therapy Equals Lobotomy.
No, It's Different Now.

142
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
E-Even The American
Psychiatric Association

143
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,300
Says That--
(Laughs) The Voters Won't Be
Reading The Annals Of The A.P.A.

144
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,300
Well, They're Not
Gonna Be Reading

145
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,500
Your Medical Records Either.
All It Takes Is One Reporter

146
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,200
Flirting With A Nurse
At St. Ambrose.

147
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,900
That's How Politicians
Are Ruined.

148
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,900
But, Oh, If Those Files
Could Disappear...
That's How Doctors Are Ruined.

149
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,600
I Could Lose My License.
Violet, You Know
I Wouldn't Ask If...

150
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,800
Please. I Would Do Anything
For You. I Just...

151
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,600
I Need You To Do
This One Thing For Me.

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,100
You're Implanting A Baby
In A Baby?

153
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,600
Jenna Is A Married Woman.
She's A Teenager
And She's Dying.

154
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,100
How Long Does She Have?
A Year Or Two.

155
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,900
And What Then?
Addison, You Don't Know
This Girl Or This Family. We Do.

156
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,000
Jenna Was One Of
My First Patients.

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,200
Cutest Kid--Every Appointment,
She'd Bring A Doll With Her,

158
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,200
And Whatever Boo-Boo She'd Have,
She'd Put It On This Doll,

159
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,300
And She Wanted To Mother It.
She Doesn't Need
A Living Doll.

160
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,900
She Needs To Be Living
What Life She Has Left,

161
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,600
Making The Most Of It.
Well, For Her And Her Family,

162
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,300
"The Most Of It"
Is Having A Child.

163
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,300
Violet Has Seen Jenna's Parents
Through This Entire Process.

164
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,200
And They Went From Watching
Their Only Child Die To Hope.

165
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,300
Aren't We, In Effect,
Creating An Orphan?

166
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,800
Jenna Has Parents
And A Husband Who Loves Her.

167
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Maybe It's Young Love,
But It's Real.

168
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,000
Is She Even Strong Enough
To Carry A Baby?

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,800
Do You Really Think That We'd
Be Doing This If She Wasn't?
I Think That You All???

170
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,200
I'm Just Not Sure That You're
Doing The Right Thing.

171
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,300
Is--Is This What It's Gonna
Be Like With You In Charge,

172
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,000
Questioning Decisions
We've Already Made?

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,800
Because We <I>All</I> Talked About
This Case Last Year,

174
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,500
And We Decided That If She
Could Get Through Chemo

175
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,500
And If She Were Strong Enough...
Wait, There's A Healthy Egg.

176
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm Gonna Grab Some More.

177
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,800
I'm Gonna Get Nick
Into The Donation Room.

178
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,400
All Right, In 24 Hours,
She Could Be Pregnant.

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,800
Addison.

180
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,100
Hey, Addison.

181
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,600
Naomi Was Making A Dig At Me.

182
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,900
I Mean, What,
Just Because, What,

183
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,800
Because I Haven't Been Here
As Long As The Rest Of You--

184
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,000
Naomi Is Just Being Protective
Of Jenna. We All Are.

185
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,800
Look, Maybe From The Outside,
It Seems Crazy,

186
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,600
But What We Have Been Through
With This Girl--

187
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,000
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,900
Sam And Cooper Got Her
The Best Oncologist.

189
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,800
She Did Radiation, Chemo,
Bone Marrow.

190
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,500
I Threw The Kitchen Sink Of
Alternative Treatments At Her.

191
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,000
She's Dying.

192
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,900
But She Is Holding On
For This.

193
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,400
Naomi Was Not Making A Dig.

194
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,200
It Felt Like A Dig.

195
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
She's Trying.

196
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,000
Just...
Leave The Jenna Thing Alone.

197
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,200
(Dell) Do You Have Any Idea

198
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,800
How Much Money We're Owed
In Overdue Accounts?
How Much?

199
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,300
$142,000.

200
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,800
That Is Great.

201
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,400
 <I>That...</I> That Is Real Money.

202
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,300
Do You Want Me To Get
A Collection Agency On It?

203
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,700
What, And Give Them
A Huge Cut? No.

204
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,600
You Have The Ledger.
You Call 'Em.

205
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,400
I Need An Enforcer, Dell,

206
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,900
Someone To Call The Patients,
Motivate Them To Pay Up.

207
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
An Enforcer?

208
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,700
Enforcer.

209
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,800
Are You Busy?
Actually, I'm Waiting
For Somebody, But--

210
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,600
So My Friend Asked Me To Do
Something Terrible,

211
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,300
And I Don't Know
If I Should Do It.

212
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,700
Well, In Fact, I Know
I Shouldn't Do It,

213
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,300
But It's A Friend.
Wait. By "Friend,"
Do You Mean Guy?

214
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,400
And By "Something Terrible,"
Do You Mean Something Anal?
Cooper, It--It's Kara Wei.

215
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,200
She Asked Me To Destroy
Her Medical Records.
Kara Wei--The Kara Wei?

216
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,600
That's Your Friend
You Went To See This Morning?

217
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,100
Yeah. It's From College.
She's My Best Friend.
I'm Your Best Friend.

218
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,100
Look, She's Not Your Best Friend
If She Wants You To Destroy

219
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,300
Her Medical Records.
Well, There Was A Time

220
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,700
We Would've Done Anything
For Each Other.

221
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,200
You Know, I Went Through
Some Very Bad Times,

222
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,800
And She Was There For Me.
So You Should Put
Your Career At Risk?

223
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,800
I Owe Her.
She's Not Your Best Friend.
I Am.

224
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,800
You Were.
My Having Charlotte Doesn't Mean
That You Don't Have Me.

225
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,600
(Laughs)
And You Cannot Do This.

226
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,000
You Have To Tell Her What
You've Told Me A Million Times.
Stop Sleeping With Skanks?

227
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,700
(Charlotte)
I'll Let That Pass.
Oh, I Didn't Mean--

228
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,300
I've Got Half An Hour.
Let's Do This.
We'll Talk Later.

229
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah. Right.

230
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
Look At Your Calendar.

231
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,000
(Laughs) Okay.

232
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,500
Hi.
Hi.

233
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,100
You Know, About This Morning,

234
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,200
We Should, Uh,
We Should Probably Talk.

235
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,000
We Should, Absolutely.

236
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,000
Later.

237
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,500
Right? Okay.

238
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,000
Hey.

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,100
Hey.
I Could Have A July Baby.

240
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
That's A Good Month.
You Have A Daughter, Right?

241
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,700
Maya. She's A Few Years
Younger Than You.

242
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,700
It's The Best Thing, Huh,
Being A Parent?
Yeah, It Is.

243
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,900
It Feels Like The Only Thing
I've Ever Wanted--To Be A Mom.

244
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,000
You Are So Ahead Of The Game

245
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,100
To Know What You Want
So Clearly And To Go For It.

246
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Most People, They Put It Off
Or Make Excuses.

247
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Maybe You Don't Get
The Perspective Of How Good,

248
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
How Precious Life Is
Until It's Too Late?

249
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,200
But This Is The Only Life
You Have, Right?

250
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,600
Yeah.

251
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,500
Oh, My Gosh. I'm So Sorry.

252
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,800
Oh, It's--No, It's Fine.

253
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,500
The Basket's Over There
On The Cart, For Your Cup.
Oh. Uh, Thanks.

254
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,700
Uh, Are You Jenna's Husband?
Yeah, Nick.

255
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,600
I'm Dr. Montgomery. Addison.
Nice To Meet You.

256
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,900
Oh, The, Uh--I Couldn't
Figure Out How To Turn It Off.

257
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
Don't Worry. I've Got It.
(Chuckles)

258
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,100
Are You Okay?

259
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,600
Yeah, I'm Sorry. It's All
Just A Little... Weird.

260
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,100
I Mean, Most Of The Team Went
Out For Pizza After Practice.

261
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,200
I Came To Get Jenna Pregnant.

262
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,000
Yeah, You Should Be, Uh,

263
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,500
Dealing
With College Applications

264
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,100
And Making Your Parents
Freak Out Over Wild Parties.

265
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,600
Well, I Mean, Parents Aren't
Really In The Picture.

266
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,000
Uh, Lynn And Garry--
Jenna's Parents--

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,900
They Took Me In.

268
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,200
We've Been Dating So Long, I Was
Already Part Of The Family,

269
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,400
So It Works.

270
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,500
Can I Ask You...

271
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,700
What Happens After?

272
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,200
After?
When I Was 17, I Couldn't
Have Done What You're Doing.

273
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,000
Have You Thought This Through?
Are You Going To College?

274
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,500
Well, Uh,
I Want To Go To U-Penn,

275
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,300
And My Guidance Counselor Thinks
I Can Get A Scholarship.

276
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,800
That's Great. So Then Will You
Bring The Baby With You,

277
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,400
Or Will Jenna's Parents
Raise The Baby?

278
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,500
I Mean,
How Will You Be Involved?

279
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,300
Will You Fly Home Weekends
Or Holidays?

280
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
What Happens
When She's 10 Or 15

281
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,300
And She Asks Why Her Father
Didn't Raise Her?

282
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,600
Well, Garry And Lynn
Want To Be Parents Again,

283
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,500
And Jenna Wants A Baby, So...

284
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,300
You Are Gonna Be
The Father, Nick.

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,300
What Do You Want?

286
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,200
No, I Won't Call Back Again.

287
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,000
We've Sent You This Bill
Three Times,

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,300
And We Need You To Pay It.

289
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,400
It Wouldn't Have Hurt
So Much If You Didn't Tense Up.

290
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,600
I Didn't Know You Were
So Afraid Of Needles.

291
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,100
Shut Your Mouth.

292
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,300
If You Tell Anyone,
No Cornfield For You.
Oh, There Will Be Cornfield.

293
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,200
How'd The Job Interview Go?
Okay.

294
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,500
It's Not Out Of State
Or Anything, Right?

295
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,400
You're Not Going Anywhere?

296
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,700
I Just Took An H.I.V. Test For
You. Why Would I Go Anywhere?

297
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,600
So...

298
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,200
It's Business, Coop.

299
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,600
Let's Focus On Pleasure.

300
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,400
(Whispers) Cornfield.

301
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,900
(Naomi) I Am Injecting
A Single Sperm Into Your Egg.

302
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,700
She's Making Your Baby,
Sweetie.

303
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,200
(Gasps) Look At That.
Our Grandchild.

304
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,300
Now Over The Next 48 Hours,

305
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,700
The Cells Will Divide
And Multiply To Form An Embryo.

306
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,200
That's My Baby.
Um, Take A Picture.

307
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,800
Take A Picture Of Us
For The Album.

308
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,200
Sure. Okay, Nick, Get In There.
You're Gonna Be A Dad.

309
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,700
Nick?

310
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,300
I'm Sorry.

311
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,200
You've Been So Good To Me.
You All Have, But...
Nicky.

312
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,800
I Don't--
I Don't Want To Do This.

313
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,100
I Don't Want A Baby.

314
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,200
All Right, What Would Be
On Your Listof Things To Do
Before You Die, Coop?

315
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,600
Am I Dying? Did You Get
My Test Results From Dell?
No. What--

316
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,800
Nick, Please Come Out.
I Really Want This Baby.

317
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,700
(Nick)
We've Barely Had Sex.

318
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,100
Babies Are Supposed To Come
From Sex.

319
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,600
(Jenna)
My Parents Can Hear You.
(Garry) It's Okay, Sweetie.

320
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,900
Nick, I Mean It.
You Promised.

321
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,000
This Is Perfectly Normal.
It's Fertility Stress.

322
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,800
I Didn't Say Anything.
(Pete) I Got The Key.

323
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,600
Nick? I'm Coming In.

324
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,300
Okay.

325
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,900
What Are You Doing?
You Wanted This.

326
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,200
 <I>You</I> Wanted This.
They Wanted This.

327
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,000
But Like She Said...

328
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,900
What About What I Want?

329
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,500
Fine. Go.

330
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,100
It's Okay, Honey.

331
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,700
No, I'll Do It Without Him.

332
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,200
I'm Sorry,

333
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,400
But We Can't Use His Sperm
Without His Consent.

334
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,600
That Fertilized Egg
Can't Be Implanted.

335
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,000
That's Not Fair.

336
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,200
No, I Need This Baby.

337
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,800
It's Okay, Honey.

338
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,100
Come On. Let's Go Sit Down.

339
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,000
He Was Scared. We Were Talking.
He Had Reservations.

340
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,600
No, You Didn't Approve
Of What We Were Doing,

341
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,200
And So You Sabotaged It.
He Needed Someone To Talk To.
I Was Being A Good Doctor.

342
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,300
Do You Want To Pick Up
The Pieces Of That Girl Now?

343
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,200
I Told You To Back Off.

344
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,100
I Could Use You
On My Campaign.
(Laughs)

345
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,800
Consultant
For My Health Care Policy--

346
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,400
Affordable Coverage
For Everyone,

347
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,100
Including Mental Health.
I Have Heard
Your Stump Speech.

348
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,600
That Is Not
Why I Asked To See You.

349
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,800
Well, It May Be A Stump Speech,
But I Believe In It.

350
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,800
I Can Make Things Better, Vi.
Which Is Why I Don't Think
You Should Hide From Your Past.

351
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,700
I'm Not Hiding.
You Have An Opportunity Here
To Do Good,

352
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,300
To Embrace What Happened
To You, To Go Public.

353
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,300
Is That What You Did?

354
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,100
Well, That's Different.

355
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Is It? This Is Something From
My Past I Want Kept Personal.

356
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,200
Mental Illness Is Nothing
To Be Ashamed Of.

357
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,700
Neither Is Rape,

358
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,800
But You Chose To Bury It.

359
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,900
And I Held Your Hand
Every Step Of The Way.

360
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,200
I Know.

361
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,400
I Know You Were There
For Me.

362
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,800
But Burying This...
Is Not Good For You.

363
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,000
Hiding A Secret,
Walking Around Worried About

364
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,300
When The Other Shoe Is Gonna
Drop, It's Gonna Eat You Up.

365
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,400
And I Am Not Talking
About Kara Wei,

366
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,200
The Congressional Candidate.

367
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,700
I'm Talking About Kara,My Friend.
You Can Stop It Now, Violet.

368
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,600
When--When I First Met You,
And Your Mother Had Just Died

369
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,200
And You Didn't Talk About It
And You Buried It,

370
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,700
It Almost Did You In

371
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,500
Until You Opened Up To Me,

372
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,600
And Then You Got Help.

373
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,000
And Then I Opened Up To You
And I Learned The Same Lesson.

374
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
This Is Different.
No, No, It's Not.

375
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,000
You Are About To Be
In A Position Of Power.

376
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,500
Think How Many People
You Could Help

377
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
If They Knew That It Was Okay
To Talk About--

378
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,800
I Have Plenty Of People I Help.

379
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,600
Hell, I'm <I>Surrounded</I> By People
Who Want My Help.
I--

380
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,000
I Came To <I>You</I> Because I Thought
You Would Help <I>Me.</I>

381
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,000
I Thought We Did That
For Each Other.

382
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,000
Hey, Did You Get My Patients'
Blood Work Back From The Lab?

383
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Uh, Not Till Tomorrow.
These Are Rapid Blood Tests!

384
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,600
You Know What I Would Like
Before I Die, Sam?

385
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,300
I Would Like A Lab That
Delivers Test Results On Time.

386
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,000
Wait. That Wasn't The Point
Of My Question.

387
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,300
It's About Life.
It's About Living.

388
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,100
I Sat There Today
With A Girl Who's Dying,

389
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,000
Who's Not Afraid To Live.
And Me--
This Is About Naomi.

390
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,700
Yes.
I Shook Up My Whole World

391
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,700
Because I Felt I Hadn't
Been Living, All Right?

392
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,400
And What Do I Do? Nothing.

393
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,600
Now I'm Talking About
Getting Back Together With Naomi

394
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,300
Without Ever... You Know,
Stepping Off A Cliff.

395
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,800
You Want To Step Off
A Cliff?

396
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,300
I Want To Do Something Big.
What Did You Have In Mind?

397
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,600
Get Ready To Step Off
The Cliff, My Friend.

398
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,500
Okay.

399
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,400
Okay.

400
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,400
Yeah, That's Badass,
Isn't It?

401
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Yeah, Congratulations.

402
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,500
You've Crossed
The Same Threshold

403
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,800
As Every 10-Year-Old Girl
In America.

404
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
What's Happening?

405
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,800
That's Awful.

406
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,800
When Did He Leave You?

407
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,000
That's Fine.
You Just Take Your Time.

408
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,800
Okay.

409
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,900
I'm Done. You Know The Economy
Is Really Bad, Right?

410
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,000
People Are Hurting.
Dell--

411
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,300
I Came Back To Be A Midwife,
To Do Less Administration.

412
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,600
 <I>And</I> When We Dig Out
Of The Hole, You Will.

413
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,700
Right Now Everyone Is
Taking On Extra Duty.
They're Doing More Medicine.

414
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,000
??

415
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,300
We Need A Bill Collector
Or The Rest Of The Money.

416
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,000
What?

417
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,300
You Know Something.
Dell?

418
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
No, I-I Don't.
Dell.

419
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,200
I Don't Know Anything.

420
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,900
William Dell Parker.

421
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,200
What Do You Know?

422
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,400
We Have Been Killing Ourselves
Trying To Save This Practice,

423
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
And You Have 10,000 Square Feet

424
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,200
Of Prime Office Space
On The Fourth Floor?

425
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,300
It Is Not As Simple
As It Sounds.

426
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Then Make Me Understand, Nai.

427
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,700
The Practice
Is At Stake Here.

428
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,200
This <I>Is</I> The Practice.
This Was Our First Space--

429
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,100
Mine And Sam's.

430
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,900
Maya... (Laughs) Maya Learned
How To Walk Here.

431
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,400
And We Had An Opportunity
To Create A Medical Sanctuary.

432
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Addison, Look--Cardiologists,
Surgical Suites, M.R.I. Suites,

433
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,400
A Dedicated Lab.
(Elevator Bell Dings)

434
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,600
This Was The Practice
We Always Dreamed Of.
(Sam) The Practice

435
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,500
Look, Now The Only Way
To Lease This Place

436
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,700
Is With A 5-
Or 10-Year Commitment,

437
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,300
And That Would Mean Giving Up
On Our Future.

438
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,200
If We Lease It,
We Can Pay Off Our Debt,

439
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,100
Our Cash Flow Will Be Way Up.

440
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,300
It'll Allow Us To Stay Afloat.
No--This Is An Issue

441
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,400
On Which We See Eye To Eye.
We're Not Leasing It Out,
Addison.

442
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,100
You Are Holding On To Something
That We Cannot Afford.

443
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,900
And Once Again, You Are
Trying To Control Everything.

444
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,700
What, It's Not Enough
That You've Already Ruined

445
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,100
The Last Wish Of A Dying Girl--
You Know What, Nai?
Keep It Up.

446
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,600
'Cause Eventually
I'm Gonna Stop Caring

447
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Whether Or Not You Forgive Me.

448
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,500
And, Sam, You Knew About This
Place, And You Kept It From Me.

449
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,800
Nice. Great.

450
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,700
Thank You.
Thanks For Backing Me Up.

451
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,600
Well, This Is Our Future.
So...

452
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,100
What The Hell
Is In Your Ear?

453
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,200
Oh. (Chuckles) It's A, Uh,
It's A Stud.

454
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,100
You Know, Like Harrison Ford,
Michael Jordan. You Like It?

455
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,200
Well... (Chuckles) Maybe
Maya Will Think It's Hip.

456
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,800
Yeah. Hip.

457
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,900
Speaking Of, You Know,
Maybe We Could Come Over

458
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,300
To Dinner Tonight, You Know?

459
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,100
And Then Afterwards,
You And I Could Talk About Us.

460
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Okay, Yeah.

461
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,400
Yeah?

462
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,500
Sure.
Okay.

463
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,700
The Kid's 17, And They Want
To Use Him As A Baby Factory.

464
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,800
If It Was Me,
I'd Run Away, Too.

465
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
Why Should That Boy
Want To Be Tied Down?

466
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,700
Great. I'm Already Dealing
With One Girl Who's Dying.

467
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,700
That's Subtle.
I Just Want You
To Be Healthy.

468
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,100
I'm A Smoker, Pete.
Take It Or Leave It.

469
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,400
The Lab Is Fast... Usually.

470
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,700
No Preacher, No Cornfield.

471
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,300
Oh, I Needed Sex Today.

472
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,200
Me, Too.

473
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,300
Violet's Being
All Passive-Aggressive.

474
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,800
Addison's At War
With Sam And Naomi

475
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,000
Over Leasing A Floor
Of The Building.

476
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,300
We're Doctors
Fighting Over Leases,

477
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,500
That's How Broke We Are.

478
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,700
Yeah?

479
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,300
Tell Me Why You're Looking
For Jobs?

480
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,200
I'm Not A Doctor Anymore.

481
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,100
I'm An Administrator.

482
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,200
I Need More. I Need... Oh.

483
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
The Interview Today
Was Really Interesting.

484
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,900
It Was...

485
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
What?

486
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Never Mind.

487
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,900
Hey, We Can Still Be
In The Cornfield.

488
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,100
Come On.
Finish What You Were Saying.

489
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,300
I'm Your Friend,
Possibly Your Best Friend,

490
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,600
And We Still Don't Have
Any Condoms.
No Need.

491
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,200
(Sighs)
I'm Pure As The Driven Snow.

492
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,700
I'm
The "Everything But" Girl...

493
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,400
Who's Waiting For Marriage.

494
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,000
And You...
Are The Horny Field Hand.

495
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,800
And We Can Only Use
Our Tongues.

496
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,200
So If I Lease The Fourth Floor,
Then Sam And Naomi Hate Me.

497
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,100
But If Don't,
The Practice May Go Under.

498
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,600
So You Lease It, Right?
You Make It Sound Easy.

499
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,300
I Lead Guys Every Day.
A Leader Makes Tough Decisions.

500
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Sometimes That Means

501
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,900
Pissing Off A Friend
For The Good Of The Group.

502
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,600
Oh. I Want People
To Stop Being Pissed Off.

503
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,200
Well, You Need To Decide
Who You Want To Be--

504
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,900
A Good Friend
Or A Good Leader.

505
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,700
You're Smart.
I Don't Like That.

506
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,900
Yes, You Do.

507
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,700
Do You Want Me To Eat Noodles
Off Your Back?

508
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,900
Yes.

509
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,000
Please. (Laughs)

510
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,300
(Maya) So Are You Gonna Move
Back In,

511
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,800
Or Will We Move Here
To The Beach House?

512
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,800
I <I>Love</I> The Beach.
Uh, I-I Don't Know.
I Don't Know, Honey.

513
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,700
Are You Gonna Have
Another Wedding?
(Laughs)

514
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,600
That'd Be So Cool.

515
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,100
(Clears Throat)
Well... Um...

516
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,500
You Know, It's--It's--It's--

517
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Your Dad And I Have
A Lot To Discuss.

518
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,100
Oh, I Know.
I'm Just Really Excited.

519
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah, Uh...

520
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Come On, Eat.

521
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,900
Where You Going?

522
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,200
You Don't Want To Know.

523
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,800
No. Violet. Don't Do This.

524
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,300
If She Was Your Friend,
She Wouldn't Be A--

525
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,100
Last Night, I Stayed Up Alone
And Watched

526
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,800
Starving Teenage Girls
Vying To Be Supermodels.

527
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,700
What Did You Do, Coop?
(Plastic Crinkles)

528
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,600
(Elevator Bell Dings)
Best Friend, My Ass.

529
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,100
Hey.
Hey, Sam.

530
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,900
Hello.
Hey.

531
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,400
You Want To Know How I Spent
The Rest Of My Night

532
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,100
After You Rushed Us
Out Your Door?

533
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,100
Answering Questions
That You Ducked All Night.
We Talked.

534
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,800
Yeah, About Algebra Tests
And Piano Lessons.

535
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,800
We Were Supposed To Talk
About Us.
I Know. I'm Sorry, Nai.

536
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,600
I, Uh, I Been Trying
To Figure Some Things Out,

537
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,700
And I... Wrote A List.
What Is This?

538
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,200
The Things I Want To--
Things I'm Going To Do.
"Climb Mount Kilimanjaro"?

539
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Yeah.
With Or Without Your Inhaler?

540
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,700
H--Don't Mock My List.

541
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,600
"Learn To Sail"?
"Drive Through The Badlands"?
Yeah, Yeah.

542
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,100
What--What--Is This--
Is This A Midlife Crisis?

543
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
Or--Or Is The Prospect Of Us
Getting Back Together

544
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,500
Making You Want
To Hop In A Car

545
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,200
And Drive As Far Away
As Possible?
This Isn't About You.??

546
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,500
And--And What About
The Timing, Is That Coincidence?

547
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,700
(Elevator Bell Dings)
'Cause We've Been Apart
A Year, Sam.

548
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,600
Dr. Bennett.
Yes.

549
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,800
(Naomi) Yeah.
We Have A Few Hours
Left On The Eggs.

550
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,700
I Still Want This Baby.
What About Nick?

551
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,200
He Never Came Home Last Night.
(Lynn) We're Really Worried
About Him.

552
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,000
He's Probably
At The Stupid Arcade.

553
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,800
I Want This Baby.

554
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,900
If I Can't Use Nick's Sperm,

555
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,900
I'll Use A Sperm Donor.

556
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,000
A Sperm Donor Is Not
What We Talked About.
Yeah, But We Agreed??

557
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,100
We Agreed
To Get <I>Them</I> Pregnant.
Well--

558
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,700
A Sperm Donor?
You Know, Addison,
She Is Still Dying.

559
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
This Doesn't Change Anything.
Well, I'd Say It Does
For Nick.

560
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,900
Or Do We Usually Allow Wives
To Pick Out Sperm Donors

561
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,600
When Their Husbands
Don't Even Want Kids?

562
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,300
Look, All Naomi Is Trying To Say
Is The Family Wants This.
Her Husband Is Her Family, Too.

563
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,600
Doesn't He At Least Deserve

564
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,700
To Be Here
To Be Part Of This Decision?

565
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,000
Addison, Can You Just
Mind Your Own Business?

566
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,700
No, No,
This Is My Business.

567
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,800
God, I Hate This.

568
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
What, She--She's In Charge,

569
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
And--And So She Thinks She Gets
To Be Right About Everything?

570
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,300
I Think
The Real Problem Is...

571
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,600
She Is Right About This.

572
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,800
I Need A File
For A Patient Of Mine--

573
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,700
Kara Wei, W-E-I.

574
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,800
You're Really Doing This?
You're Stealing Files?
You Followed Me.

575
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,600
Friends Don't Let Friends
Steal.

576
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,400
Oh, Don't Even Go There.

577
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,700
Okay, Don't Take It Off
Hospital Grounds,

578
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,100
Don't Leave It Laying Around,
Put It In My Hands

579
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,200
When You're Done.
Hospital I.D.?
Look At Me And Tell Me

580
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,100
Um, I Don't Have One,
But I Do Have Privileges Here.

581
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,600
Well, You Can't Have The File
Without I.D.
And You Can't Do This.

582
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,700
Do You Have I.D.?
I Can Vouch For Her.

583
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,900
Dr. King, This Good Clerk
Has Rules--

584
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,200
Dr. Freedman,
I Assume You Have The Results

585
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,000
Of Our Patient's Blood Work.
No, I Don't.

586
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Well, Why Don't We Go To
My Office So We Can Call

587
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,100
And Find Out What's Taking
So Long? My Patient Is Anxious.

588
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,400
I'm Consulting With Dr. Turner
On A Matter--
No, No, No, No.

589
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,300
Violet--
Go.

590
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,300
??

591
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,400
I'm Not Talking
About This Anymore.

592
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,900
Jenna Still Wants
To Have A Baby.

593
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,800
She's Looking At Sperm Donors
Right Now.
If That's What She Wants...

594
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,300
It Isn't What You Want?

595
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,500
None Of This Is What I Want.

596
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,100
I Said I'd Do This.

597
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,100
I Want Her
To Be Happy, But...

598
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,700
She's Dying.

599
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,300
My Girlfrie--
My Wife Is Dying.

600
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,000
I Mean, I'm Just A Kid.
I Don't Know...

601
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,800
She's All I Have.

602
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,900
I Just Want Us To Be Happy,

603
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,700
Not With A Baby, Just...

604
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,600
Just With Each Other
With The Time She Has Left.

605
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,100
Then You Gotta Tell Her That.

606
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
Let Go Of What You Think
She Wants To Hear

607
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,500
And Just...
Just Tell Her The Truth.

608
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I Told You Everything.

609
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,200
I Poured My Heart Out To You

610
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,100
About Everything That He...
Did To Me.

611
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,800
But You...

612
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,000
You Told Me Nothing.

613
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,900
She's Dying, Nai.
I Know That.

614
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,100
You Can't Control It.
You Can't Stop It.

615
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,000
And Even If The Idea
Of This Baby

616
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Makes You Forget About It,
It's Not Going Away.
This Is Not About Control,

617
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,300
Because If We Were
Gonna Talk About Control,

618
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,600
We Might Talk About You.
You Know What, Nai?
It's A Two-Way Street.

619
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,800
And I Want To Get Past It.
I've Tried To Get Past This.

620
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,200
You Need To Decide, Are We
Gonna Get Past This Or Not?

621
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,600
Because You're Holding On
To Your Anger

622
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,900
Almost As Much As You're
Holding On To That Dying Girl.
I Am Not Holding On To Her.

623
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,900
This Is Her Dream.
And Her Husband Doesn't Want
To Take Her Dream Away From Her,

624
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,100
And Her Parents Don't Want
To Take Away That Dream,

625
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,600
But <I>You</I> Are Her Doctor.

626
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,500
You Have To Stop Holding On,
All Of You Do,

627
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,000
To Her, To The Idea Of The Baby,
To The Fourth Floor.

628
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,800
This Is Not Wrapped Up
Together With That.

629
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,300
That Is Different.
 <I>That</I> Is Our Future.

630
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,700
That's One Future,

631
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,000
Just Like Nick And Jenna
And The Baby Is One Future,

632
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And Now They Need To Find
A New Path.

633
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,400
Some Dreams...

634
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,500
You Have To Let Go.

635
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,200
She Always Used A Belt.

636
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,700
The Buckle Hit My Teeth Once,

637
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,300
Knocked Four Out.

638
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,100
I Was 16.
I Could Defend Myself.

639
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,000
But My Brother Robbie Was 9.

640
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,600
She... Put His Hand
On The Stove

641
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,100
Because She Said
He Mouthed Off.

642
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
I Couldn't Watch Her
Do That To Him.

643
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,200
The Judge Said
It Was Self-Defense,

644
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,600
And He Sealed The Record.

645
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,500
I'm Sorry This Happened
To You.

646
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,000
That's Why I Was Depressed

647
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,400
And That's Why I Needed
Shock Therapy.

648
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,000
And That's Why

649
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,100
I Need You To Destroy
Those Medical Records.

650
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,000
Destroying This File
Won't Change That It Happened.

651
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,700
It Doesn't Matter
How I Defend It, Violet.

652
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,000
The Headline Will Read,

653
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,700
"Congressional Candidate
Murdered Mom," And I'll Be Done.

654
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,300
You Can't Make This Disappear.

655
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,800
Even If The Medical Records
Go Awaway,

656
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,800
There Are Still Legal Records.
I'm A District Attorney.
Those Were Easy.

657
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,300
Kara--
Why Should I Expect
The Voters To Understand

658
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,500
When My Oldest Friend
Is Judging Me?

659
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,100
Oh. Okay.

660
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,200
You--You--You Want
To Be A Politician?

661
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Why Not Be The Right Kind,

662
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,800
The Kind Who Makes
The Right Choices?

663
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Because That's The Person
That I Knew.

664
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
I'm Giving You A-A Choice

665
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,900
Between The Person
That You Want To Be

666
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,000
And The Person That You Are,

667
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,700
Between Our Friendship And...

668
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,400
Dr. Bennett.

669
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,200
Yes.

670
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,100
I Think We Found
A Sperm Donor We Like.

671
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,800
Do You Know
Where Naomi Is?
We're Ready.

672
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,800
I-I Found Someone.

673
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,300
Can We Do It Now?

674
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
Jenna...

675
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,400
I Can't.
What?

676
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,600
I Know This Is What You Want--
You Can't Say No.

677
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,100
That's The Problem.
I Couldn't.

678
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,300
No One Could,

679
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,700
Because Everyone In This Room
Loves You

680
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,300
And Wants To Give You
Everything.

681
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,300
I Don't Want Everything.
I Just Want This Baby.

682
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,400
And You Know What I Want?

683
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,000
You Know What Everyone
In This Room Wants?

684
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,500
We Want You Not To Be Dying.

685
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,100
But You Are.

686
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,200
And When We Talk About
The Baby, We Get To Forget

687
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,600
And We Get To
Take Back Control

688
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,600
Of This Big, Ugly Thing.

689
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,600
Having A Baby Isn't
Gonna Change What's Happening.

690
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,600
And The More
You Hold On To That,

691
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,500
The Less
You're Gonna Be Able

692
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,600
To Really Live
The Life You Have Left

693
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,800
With The People Who Love You.

694
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,600
I Don't Want A Baby.

695
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,700
But I Do Want You.

696
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,600
(Voice Breaks)
I Don't Want To Die.

697
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,200
What? You Should Have
Swabbed It With Alcohol.

698
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,500
Ugh. I Don't Know
What I Was Thinking.

699
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah.

700
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,200
I Guess You Just Get
To A Point

701
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Where You Start To Wonder...

702
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,500
Wonder About All The Things
You Haven't Done.

703
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,500
But The Truth Is...

704
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,000
I Like What I've Done--

705
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,100
You Know, The Practice,
Maya, You.

706
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,000
I Want To Spend My Life

707
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,500
With The People
I Love The Most.

708
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,800
Let's Do This, Nai.

709
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,900
Let's Move Back In.

710
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,800
What?

711
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,700
If You Had
Asked Me That Yesterday

712
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,000
Or The Day Before

713
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,000
Or The Day Before...

714
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,600
That Would've Been
Exactly What I Wanted.

715
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,700
We Don't Know
Anything Else, Sam.

716
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,100
I'm Afraid That We Keep
Falling Back Together

717
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Not Because It's Right, But...

718
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,600
Because...

719
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,300
(Voice Breaking) We Want To
Hold On To What We Know.

720
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,100
And If We Move Back In,

721
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,500
It Won't Change The Fact
That It Wasn't Working.

722
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,600
We Never Really
Let Go, Sam.

723
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,100
We Have To Let Go.

724
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
Good-Bye, Sam.

725
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,400
Good-Bye, Naomi.

726
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,700
How's The Future Congresswoman
From California?

727
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,800
She's Gonna Be Good
At Her Job.

728
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,600
You Let Her Have
Those Files.
I Messed Up.

729
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,300
I Messed Up So Bad.

730
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,700
I Don't Even Think I Did It
For The Right Reasons.

731
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
I Just...

732
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,600
I Just Wanted
A... A Friend.

733
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,300
Everyone's Living,
And I'm Just Here... Alone.

734
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,300
And It D--It--

735
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,000
It Doesn't Bother Me
That You Have Charlotte.

736
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,900
I'm Happy For You. I Am.
It's Just...

737
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,700
Well, You Have Charlotte.

738
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,300
Uh, This Came For You.

739
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,000
Blood Test Results
From The Lab.

740
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,600
Thanks.

741
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,700
Well, Open It Up. Make Sure
You Have The All Clear.

742
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,400
Eh, Later.

743
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,800
Right Now I Think
My Best Friend Needs Me.

744
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,300
(Clears Throat) Look,
About The Fourth Floor--

745
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,600
You Know What?
Uh, You Were Right.

746
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,100
I Need To Let It Go.

747
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,300
So, Uh, Go Ahead
And Lease It.

748
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,200
I Already Did.
Broker Found A Tenant.

749
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,600
You're Gonna Be
A Good Leader.

750
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
Thank You.

751
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,200
You're Welcome.

752
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,300
You're Leaving.

753
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,400
Yeah. They Need Me
In Ghana.

754
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,200
Only One Direct Flight
A Week.

755
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Maybe I Was Too Hard
On You About The Smoking.

756
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,900
No. It's Not About
The Smoking.

757
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,100
This Is Who I Am.

758
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,900
I Drop In, Have A Great Time,
Then I Go.

759
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,900
Along The Way, I Smoke.
Stop Trying To Domesticate Me.

760
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,800
I'm Not Trying
To Domesticate You.
You Are. I'm Not Your Wife.

761
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,900
Who Died Before She Could
Quit Smoking.

762
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,200
Maybe I Should've
Told You That.

763
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,800
Go. Go To Ghana.

764
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,300
But...

765
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,200
Come Back.

766
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,300
I'm Happier
When You're Here.

767
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,800
I'll Think About
The Smoking.

768
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,700
And Thank You For Being Happier
When I'm Here.

769
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,400
(Cooper) The Bathtub Is Running.

770
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,100
The Candles Are Lit.

771
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,500
I've Done My Best To Recreate
The World

772
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,200
Of Two Condomless Teenagers

773
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,900
In A "Footloose,"
Conservative Town.

774
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,500
All I'm Missing Is You.

775
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,900
I'll Be Right There.
(Telephone Beeps)

776
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,300
I've Got To Admit,
In Our First Interview,

777
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,800
I Wasn't Sure About You.

778
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,100
But When You Called Me
About This Office Space,

779
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,800
I Knew You Were
The Right Person For The Job.

780
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,400
Thank You.

781
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,200
We Got Your Hopes Up.
I Know.

782
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,500
I'm Sorry.

783
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,100
I'm So, So Sorry.

784
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,300
But It's Gonna Be Okay.

785
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,900
All Right?

786
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,300
We're Gonna Be Okay.

787
