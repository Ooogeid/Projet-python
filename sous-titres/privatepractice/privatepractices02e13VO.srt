1
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,010
What?

2
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:18,917
It was really just work?

3
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:21,822
- You've gotta be kidding.
- I'm...

4
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:25,440
I'm just saying, you were out late,
you didn't answer your phone...

5
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:26,694
you didn't call.

6
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:29,886
We've had this conversation
every day for a week.

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,101
I had to go back to the office for work.

8
00:00:38,887 --> 00:00:41,214
I'm sorry.
I should've called.

9
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:45,844
- What?
- I do this for a living, Addison.

10
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:49,510
I read people.
What aren't you telling me?

11
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,212
I am telling you...

12
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,031
everything.

13
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:58,644
Take your clothes off.

14
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:09,072
You look great.
You got a date tonight?

15
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:11,171
No, not a... last night?

16
00:01:11,348 --> 00:01:14,191
Not a date.
Just... met a colleague.

17
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:17,011
A male colleague,
handsome male colleague?

18
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:19,432
- Tell me yours, I'll tell you mine.
- There's a yours? You have a guy?

19
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:21,482
- I was joking.
- Did you or did you not...

20
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:23,461
sleep with Wyatt Lockhart?

21
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:25,691
We...

22
00:01:26,277 --> 00:01:28,201
have a mom in labor waiting.

23
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:30,531
I have to go scrub in.

24
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:35,102
Okay, you're doing great, Judy.
Just keep breathing. Okay?

25
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,140
She's fully dilated.
Contractions every 2 minutes.

26
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:41,261
Where... are Matt and Carrie?
'Cause this is their baby.

27
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,931
- They need to be here.
- Just keep breathing, okay?

28
00:01:44,107 --> 00:01:46,923
promise me that they'll take the baby
away as soon as it's out, because

29
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:49,882
- I don't think I can look at him
and then and let go.
- I know....

30
00:01:49,987 --> 00:01:51,931
I really want the Sinclairs to he him.

31
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:55,290
- Get down there.
- Go... Go deliver. Go... come on...

32
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:57,911
Get ready to start pushing, okay?

33
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:02,182
Thank god. We ran out of the house
without the video camera.

34
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:03,861
I can't believe
this is finally happening.

35
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:05,921
Here we go.
Ready? Big push.

36
00:02:08,537 --> 00:02:09,920
I can see the head.

37
00:02:15,347 --> 00:02:16,720
I think it's...

38
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:18,813
What... what's wrong?

39
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,533
- Dell, press on her stomach.
- What's wrong?

40
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:25,542
Judy, your baby's shoulder is stuck
on your pubic bone. He's in distress.

41
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:27,743
I'm gonna have to insert my hand
and push the baby back in.

42
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:29,992
You want to put it back inside of me?

43
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:32,742
The baby's oxygen supply
is compromised, okay?

44
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:35,960
So we're gonna get you to the hospital
and I'm gonna do a c-section.

45
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:38,701
Everything is gonna be fine.
We're gonna take care of everything.

46
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:41,480
- Okay, you ready?
- You're gonna be fine, okay?

47
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:42,990
Here we go.

48
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:50,742
<i>Private Practice S02E13
Nothing to Fear<i>

49
00:02:56,387 --> 00:02:57,633
Things feel...

50
00:02:57,988 --> 00:02:59,573
as if they're....

51
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:02,250
different this time.
I feel like we're...

52
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:05,453
different. I feel so...

53
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:07,021
good.

54
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:10,863
- You feel it?
- Feeling it.

55
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:15,293
Let's get married.

56
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:22,862
I'm the groom. You are the...
the naughty, naughty...

57
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,360
maid of honor...

58
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:29,303
You're serious?

59
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:37,712
you know what I was thinking?
We need to heed our own advice.

60
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:42,382
Take a mental health day, forget about
our clients for a while and live for us.

61
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:49,143
Not that this isn't living for us.
I mean, this is... great.

62
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:53,412
I mean, I'm not just talking about
the sex. Although that is excellent.

63
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:55,870
Did I mention I tend to ramble
when I'm nervous?

64
00:03:55,977 --> 00:03:59,791
Which I am right now, a little,
because you're making odd noises.

65
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:04,421
Everything okay?

66
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,593
I'm fine.
I've never been better.

67
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:13,891
Here we go.

68
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,130
There we are.

69
00:04:19,756 --> 00:04:21,392
Vicryl, close her up.

70
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:27,413
- What's wrong?
- The baby's having trouble breathing.

71
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:29,733
Judy, it's most likely
a diaphragmatic hernia.

72
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:33,922
It's a birth defect in the muscle that
separate the chest from the abdomen.

73
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:36,222
There are some choices
that you have to make for surgery.

74
00:04:36,398 --> 00:04:38,422
- You have options.
- No, I'm not the mother anymore.

75
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:40,440
You... need...
to talk to the Sinclairs.

76
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:44,251
Listen, until the adoption is finalized,
you're still the legal guardian.

77
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,983
It has to be the Sinclairs.

78
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:01,201
Don't you want to know
what's wrong with me?

79
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:02,853
Don't you want to know
what's wrong with me?

80
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:05,772
Have you seen... I'm sorry.
I didn't... I didn't know...

81
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:08,293
It's okay.
I actually wanted to talk to you.

82
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:10,290
Right. That's my cue.

83
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:14,671
We have much to discuss,
you and I. All right.

84
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,230
It's been weird between us.
It's been two weeks of weird.

85
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:21,940
You're dating Sheldon.
You made a choice.

86
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,320
- I'm an adult.
- Good.

87
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:26,573
I just... I just don't want it
to be weird... between us.

88
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:28,582
I mean, not now.

89
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:29,902
I mean...

90
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:31,011
good.

91
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:32,670
Good.

92
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:37,772
Giving you any relief?

93
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:43,152
Could you turn whatever you're doing up?
My...

94
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:47,020
- gut's on fire.
- You got it.

95
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:50,622
- I wish I could do more.
- You've done wonders.

96
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:52,960
Do you know how boring radiology is?

97
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:55,411
- Looking at films all day?
- Don't start.

98
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:56,632
I know you.
You were great.

99
00:05:56,737 --> 00:06:00,300
I did it because it was easy...
a good doctorial profession

100
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:03,570
for a man who liked to sleep in
and party.

101
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:07,340
Well, maybe you got it right...
living in the moment.

102
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:11,283
My even more handsome doctor.

103
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:13,861
And who ever thought that was possible?

104
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:16,492
You've got the serious face, Sam.

105
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:21,571
How much time do I have, doctor?

106
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:24,752
The chemo hasn't helped.
There's been no change.

107
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,333
I know the drill.

108
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:30,610
The cancer attacks my liver,
my liver fails, painful death...

109
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:32,971
three or

110
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:35,283
four weeks, give or take.

111
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:37,760
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:40,123
I'll do whatever I can to help
the pain. I'll come to your house.

113
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:42,652
We'll do whatever we need to do to help.

114
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:44,700
That's good.

115
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:47,861
That's very good,
because I'm gonna need your help.

116
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:49,820
I want you to help me die.

117
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:54,492
But the baby's supposed to be healthy.

118
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,482
He was born with a diaphragmatic hernia.

119
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:59,783
The organs below the diaphragm
are pushing into his thoracic cavity,

120
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:01,260
and he's having a hard time breathing.

121
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:02,482
I know this is a lot,

122
00:07:02,618 --> 00:07:05,580
but Addison needs to do the surgery
quickly to help the baby to breathe.

123
00:07:05,695 --> 00:07:07,080
Now there are two surgical options.

124
00:07:07,146 --> 00:07:10,321
The first is relatively simple
and will correct the problem for now,

125
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:13,183
but as the baby grows,
he'll require more surgery.

126
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:17,353
And the second is hier risk, but
it will be a more permanent solution.

127
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:19,982
- I can't believe this is happening.
- What... does Judy want to do?

128
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,422
- Well, she wants you to decide.
- The adoption isn't even final.

129
00:07:23,446 --> 00:07:24,522
Which is why I'm here.

130
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:26,842
Since the birth mother
is abdicating her right to decide,

131
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:30,471
the hospital will honor your wishes about
what to do, but we need a decision now.

132
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:31,433
I don't know.

133
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:34,561
Well, what I would recommend
is the more aggressive approach.

134
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:35,910
But he could die?

135
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:39,371
- I can't... do this.
- No, you can.

136
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:42,161
- Just trust Dr. Montgomery.
- I'm sorry.

137
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:43,783
I can't.

138
00:07:48,138 --> 00:07:49,270
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:05,523
- I made it.
- You made it.

140
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:08,170
- You're doing great, mom.
- Let's go back.

141
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:11,402
She's losing it.

142
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:13,023
It took both of us
to get her out the front door.

143
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,300
Well, agoraphobia's tough.

144
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:16,222
She's... been entrenched
for a long time.

145
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,461
I've heard that for years.

146
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,314
I heard that when she missed
my violin recitals,

147
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:20,882
my school plays, my graduation.

148
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:22,921
I'm getting married tomorrow.

149
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,821
I want my mother there.

150
00:08:24,997 --> 00:08:27,993
Please. You have to make sure
she doesn't back out.

151
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:34,451
I'm... I'm so sorry.

152
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,800
There's an emergency.

153
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,631
I have to go to the hospital.

154
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:41,632
But I can be back in...
in less than an hour.

155
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:43,133
It's okay. I'll go.

156
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:49,211
This could be good.
It's an exercise,

157
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:52,293
'cause you're out in the world,
but you're in here, safe, secure.

158
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:55,871
You can practice your breathing,
your visualizations.

159
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:58,601
- I can't.
- Mom, please.

160
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:00,403
You need to do this.

161
00:09:04,118 --> 00:09:06,163
There are laws against
assisted suicide.

162
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:07,932
There's no one coming after us, Sam.

163
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:12,000
There's no family to consider. There's
just Alexander, and he wants to die.

164
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:14,603
- Who wants to die?
- Patient with pancreatic cancer.

165
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,902
Stage IV-b pancreatic cancer,
and he's a doctor.

166
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:19,771
Well, if he's a doctor,
he's gonna find a way.

167
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:21,903
- He wants morphine.
- Which we should give him.

168
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:24,360
That's kinda going out
on the limb there, Dr. Kevorkian.

169
00:09:24,456 --> 00:09:29,080
Alexander has nothing left but the chance
to control when and how the end comes.

170
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:31,731
This is... it's mercy, not murder.

171
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:35,402
Letting nature run its course
is different than helping nature along.

172
00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:38,383
So it doesn't matter how we try
to rationalize it, there is no

173
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:41,050
moral difference between
writing him a prescription

174
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:44,910
and buying him a gun. I won't do it.
The practice won't allow it.

175
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:50,113
The Sinclairs... they're probably not
gonna go through with the adoption.

176
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:51,190
What?

177
00:09:51,978 --> 00:09:53,292
Because he's sick?

178
00:09:53,368 --> 00:09:55,980
Let's not worry about them right now.
He needs surgery.

179
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:57,561
And without your consent,

180
00:09:57,645 --> 00:10:00,941
the hospital won't allow Dr. Montgomery
to do what she thinks is best for him.

181
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:03,111
She told me before I had to choose.

182
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:05,063
I don't think I can choose
and then let go.

183
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:08,290
I think you've been choosing
what's best for the baby all along.

184
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:10,751
He needs you, one last time.

185
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:19,461
Paper's signed.
You're good to go.

186
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:21,473
- Judy came through.
- Yeah, for now.

187
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:24,202
I'm still hoping that the Sinclairs
will come through.

188
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:27,792
They walked in a crisis.
Would you want that for your kid?

189
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:29,680
Maybe we should talk
about something else.

190
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:32,712
Like who you're dating? The
colleague you refuse to tell me about?

191
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:34,730
Well, you're one to talk.
What about Wyatt?

192
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:39,220
Why is everyone so stuck on what did
or didn't happen with Wyatt?

193
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:41,521
Well, who else is stuck on it?
You didn't tell Kevin?

194
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:43,341
There's nothing to tell.
It didn't happen.

195
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:45,882
I didn't cheat.
I didn't go out on the date.

196
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:48,101
I just went into his office
and kissed him.

197
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:49,590
- Pardon me?
- And then I walked out.

198
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:50,872
So technically, it wasn't cheating.

199
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:54,022
Technically, you walked into his office
and you kissed him and...

200
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:57,633
and stopped and I left,
and I have not seen him since.

201
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:59,363
Kevin keeps asking where I was,

202
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:02,741
and I keep telling him I was working
and I divert him with sex.

203
00:11:02,878 --> 00:11:04,113
But it was nothing.

204
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:07,243
If it was nothing,
then did you wait a week to tell me?

205
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,121
Baby's sats are falling.

206
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:14,983
Okay, take him off the vent and bag him.
I gotta go in now.

207
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:18,250
Nora, I'm so sorry.
I was just...

208
00:11:25,758 --> 00:11:28,863
- Have you seen your mother?
- She's not in your office?

209
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:31,012
Maybe she's in the bathroom.

210
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,640
Are you in there?

211
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,971
Do you want to come out?

212
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,121
Sorry.

213
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:31,712
It's open.

214
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:36,953
Lovely to see you.

215
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:40,143
I'm treating myself
to chocolate pudding...

216
00:12:40,797 --> 00:12:41,841
my favorite.

217
00:12:45,085 --> 00:12:46,471
I wanted to tell you in person.

218
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:49,063
We can't prescribe drugs
to help you kill yourself.

219
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,413
I understand.

220
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:52,522
I wasn't counting on it.

221
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:55,162
You're still handling the pain,
and you have time. Not...

222
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:57,100
much, but...
time.

223
00:12:57,518 --> 00:13:00,781
Get closure, say your good-byes,
enjoy your last days.

224
00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:03,182
I'm the last of my friends left alive.

225
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:06,002
I have no lover, no children, no one.

226
00:13:07,517 --> 00:13:09,960
In the coming days,
I'll either be in extraordinary pain

227
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:13,951
or I'll be so high on drugs
that I might as well be dead.

228
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:18,013
I don't believe those are last days
I'd like to enjoy.

229
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:21,552
Well...

230
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,182
- You're enjoying sugar.
- Oh, this isn't sugar.

231
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:32,131
It's a mixture. 16 alprazolam tablets
from my bathroom, 

232
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:35,722
12 dusty codeine tablets
from the hall bathroom,

233
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:38,840
a couple of muscle relaxants,
some sleeping pills

234
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:44,650
and a tiny bit of L.S.D. leftover
from a fabulous party in 1972.

235
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,921
Don't bother.
It's okay.

236
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,791
I'm already on my second bowl.

237
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:53,963
I told you...

238
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:56,251
I'm gonna die.

239
00:14:00,046 --> 00:14:02,480
The baby's out of surgery.
Okay? It went well.

240
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:06,013
Addison was amazing. So...
I thought you'd like to know

241
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:09,900
I can't stop thinking about him.

242
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:13,063
All I want to do is not think
about the baby, and I can't stop.

243
00:14:13,155 --> 00:14:15,631
Is it scary in there, in the nicu?

244
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:17,881
There's someone talking to him, right?

245
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:19,712
It's not a scary place?

246
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:26,340
I just... I have these terrible images
of him all alone, and I can't stand it.

247
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:27,880
I can't.

248
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,973
Do you want to see him?

249
00:14:36,146 --> 00:14:37,172
Oh, god.

250
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:43,641
- You having pain?
- It's okay.

251
00:14:50,787 --> 00:14:52,590
Except for drinking alone.

252
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:58,190
I know you're uncomfortable.
You don't have to stay.

253
00:14:58,287 --> 00:14:59,003
I do.

254
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:02,343
If I walk out the door,
all I'll do is think about you, here,

255
00:15:03,148 --> 00:15:05,291
- dying alone.
- I lived alone.

256
00:15:06,858 --> 00:15:08,412
You reap what you sow.

257
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:10,561
Sow carefully, my friend.

258
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:13,431
you don't want to end up tragic,

259
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:15,203
like me.

260
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:21,180
It's small...

261
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:24,442
contained...
secure.

262
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:26,250
But...

263
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:29,160
you're alone in there, Nora.

264
00:15:29,657 --> 00:15:33,292
I'm here with you.
But I feel more here if you come out.

265
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,450
I can't.

266
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:41,530
What are you afraid of?

267
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:45,453
Everything.

268
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:51,151
I feel it in the... the pit
of my stomach. It consumes me.

269
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:55,602
People look at me...
all those people...

270
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:57,811
- and I feel scared...
- You're... letting it get big.

271
00:15:57,886 --> 00:15:59,411
Let's break it down.

272
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,453
I can't.
Don't you see that?

273
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:06,762
I'm letting my daughter down,
I'm letting everyone down, and I...

274
00:16:06,936 --> 00:16:08,543
I feel so scared.

275
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:11,410
I mean, you've never felt this.
How can you know?

276
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:19,393
I'm gonna break all the rules and
I'm gonna tell you something about me.

277
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:29,772
I am more afraid
than I've ever been in my life.

278
00:16:31,545 --> 00:16:32,443
I'm...

279
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:34,880
pregnant.

280
00:16:36,355 --> 00:16:37,572
And that is...

281
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:43,240
paralyzingly,
terrifyingly scary for me.

282
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:46,831
But I...

283
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:52,252
got up this morning and I came
to the office because people needed me.

284
00:16:52,347 --> 00:16:54,331
And that's good, to be needed,

285
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:55,860
to help you.

286
00:16:56,818 --> 00:17:00,631
And I'm using that
to fight back my fear.

287
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:14,750
Motherhood is great.

288
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,412
That's nothing to be afraid of.

289
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:23,160
My daughter is the best part of my life.

290
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:30,773
Then shouldn't you be at her wedding?

291
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:51,642
Well done.

292
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:55,652
I freaked out.

293
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:58,233
I couldn't think.
I didn't know what to do.

294
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:00,782
We made a mistake,
but we're here now.

295
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:04,693
We want to adopt him.
We've always wanted to adopt him.

296
00:18:07,757 --> 00:18:10,981
Judy, we screwed up.
We know what you must think.

297
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:12,671
That you want him now,

298
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:14,672
- when he's fixed?
- It's not like that, Judy.

299
00:18:14,746 --> 00:18:16,753
You made me
want to give him to you.

300
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:19,822
I thought you were the answer,
and then when I needed you, when...

301
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,610
when he needed you...

302
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:40,302
I'm keeping my baby.

303
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:44,852
I'm keeping my son.

304
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:59,240
Can you tell me if Dr. Wyatt Lockhart
is working tonight?

305
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:00,943
You are still here.

306
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,972
Where else would I be
when I say that I'm working?

307
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:07,512
You know what people with a guilty conscience do when

308
00:19:07,686 --> 00:19:08,921
faced with having to lie?

309
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:11,110
They ask a question back at you.

310
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:12,762
Look...

311
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:13,540
I'm not.

312
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:15,752
- I'm kid... I'm kidding, Addison.
- No, you're not.

313
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,120
What do you want to hear, Kevin?

314
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:20,070
What do you want me to say
that's gonna make you feel better?

315
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:23,103
I have to go check on the baby.

316
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,981
you never came back,
and you... didn't answer your phone.

317
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:42,522
No, I didn't.

318
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,953
Pete's just keeping me company.

319
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:47,901
He's Charon, guiding me down
the river Styx.

320
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:50,161
And he didn't give me the prescription.

321
00:19:50,268 --> 00:19:52,202
I used alternative methods.

322
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,883
- Wait, so... are you saying...
- He made a choice.

323
00:19:58,266 --> 00:19:59,650
I'm calling 9-1-1.

324
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,423
- He doesn't want the hospital, Sam.
- This is a crime.

325
00:20:02,527 --> 00:20:04,622
- This is a man's life.
- This is death.

326
00:20:04,728 --> 00:20:05,923
He's doing this his way.

327
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,781
Sam, do you really want
to put him through hell,

328
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:10,752
pump his stomach, only to put him
through hell in a few days or a week?

329
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,081
I'm not gonna sit here and let you...

330
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,913
- here, here.
- This doesn'T...

331
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:20,341
- it doesn't have to be this way.
- You can go, Sam.

332
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:22,552
Just don't call anyone.

333
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:26,940
Don't take it upon yourself to try
to fix something that can't be fixed.

334
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:57,790
Let's do it, Charlotte.

335
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:03,442
It's gonna....
it's gonna be great...

336
00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:05,991
the cuyahoga county Freedmans meet
the kings from Monroeville.

337
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:07,983
And we can do it, like,
halfway in between.

338
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:11,493
- How do you feel about Nashville?
- I want to marry you.

339
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,261
Tomorrow in Vegas.

340
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:16,992
Tomorrow?

341
00:21:18,136 --> 00:21:21,141
- My mother, she's...
- Families complicate things.

342
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:23,790
Family is messy.
Let's do this.

343
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:26,373
Marry me, Cooper Freedman.

344
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:43,043
What... what's wrong? What do you need?
What can I get you? What can I get you?

345
00:21:43,688 --> 00:21:45,182
It's just the pain.

346
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,500
It comes and goes in waves.

347
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:55,292
Oh, now... now it's going.

348
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,032
I hate seeing you like this.

349
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:03,163
It's not my favorite thing, either.

350
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:06,161
It's not like I want to die.
If I could live...

351
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:09,580
like I lived when I lived...

352
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,912
and I lived, let me tell you.

353
00:22:19,618 --> 00:22:21,953
I thought once I might fall in love.

354
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:24,350
I had lots of sex.

355
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:33,042
I guess I was just far too good-looking
for my own good.

356
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:34,751
You and Naomi split.

357
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,661
- You got a girlfriend now?
- kinda.

358
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:40,982
You like her?

359
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:42,473
A lot.

360
00:22:42,955 --> 00:22:44,182
How's the sex?

361
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,951
I'm a dying man.
Indulge me.

362
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:51,750
We actually...
we haven't reached that level yet.

363
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:54,402
Taking it slow.

364
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:58,170
I suppose that's the way you find love.

365
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:01,330
Just don't end up
like me, Sam.

366
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:04,373
It's not that good to die alone.

367
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:19,192
I'm gonna go for walk.

368
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:30,713
- We brought some things for the baby.
- She's not changing her mind.

369
00:23:31,348 --> 00:23:34,591
It's... it's all right.
He has every right to be angry.

370
00:23:37,027 --> 00:23:38,391
They weren't to change Judy's mind.

371
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:40,612
They were things we bought
that we wanted him to have.

372
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:43,453
- He should still have them.
- Well, we'll pass 'em on.

373
00:23:50,937 --> 00:23:53,713
For what it's worth,
we know how badly we screwed up.

374
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:57,563
After the miscarriages
and the adoptions that fell apart,

375
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:02,050
- we felt like we lost those babies.
- The thought of this baby...

376
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:04,231
We were afraid of not having him.

377
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:07,620
And now we don't have him.
We've lost another child...

378
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:11,231
and it's our own fault.

379
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:40,892
She won't get out of the car.

380
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:43,982
I can't get married without her there.

381
00:24:44,606 --> 00:24:45,520
I won't.

382
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:47,760
- Please.
- Don't worry.

383
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:50,221
She's gonna be there.
Just go.

384
00:25:02,277 --> 00:25:03,792
So you got here.

385
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:07,683
That's a huge step.

386
00:25:08,438 --> 00:25:09,770
It's not enough.

387
00:25:10,037 --> 00:25:13,420
I'm a failure.
I used to think I was a good mother.

388
00:25:16,885 --> 00:25:19,193
Now she'd be better off without me.

389
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:27,080
Did...

390
00:25:27,646 --> 00:25:30,701
did Dell tell you that the Sinclairs
came by with some things for the baby?

391
00:25:30,797 --> 00:25:31,773
Yeah, but they bailed,

392
00:25:31,825 --> 00:25:34,153
- so there's no more...
- Dell, can I talk to you for a minute,
please?

393
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:35,183
Excuse me.

394
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:42,033
You're pushing Judy to do
what you think is right.

395
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:43,823
- It is right.
- You need to listen.

396
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:46,802
If you'd listened, you would've heard
how scared the Sinclairs were.

397
00:25:46,887 --> 00:25:48,952
- I heard.
- No, dell, you walked out.

398
00:25:49,028 --> 00:25:51,010
Can't you see she's terrified?

399
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:53,050
Listen to her, Dell.

400
00:25:53,358 --> 00:25:55,743
Isn't that what she's been telling you
all along?

401
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:58,132
You don't think I should keep him?

402
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:00,123
That's not mine to say.

403
00:26:00,965 --> 00:26:04,182
If you know that this is right,
keeping the baby, then it is.

404
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:05,601
It's right, period.

405
00:26:05,777 --> 00:26:08,383
You just need to make sure that you're
doing it for the right reasons, Judy.

406
00:26:08,488 --> 00:26:10,641
Not because you think you have to

407
00:26:10,728 --> 00:26:14,843
or because you think that others think
you should, because you want to.

408
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:24,050
When my husband walked out...

409
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:27,251
I couldn't believe it.

410
00:26:28,277 --> 00:26:31,691
I kept thinking that he was
going to come home.

411
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:39,060
I wouldn't leave the house
in case he came back.

412
00:26:39,595 --> 00:26:41,553
- I had to be there.
- So you got stuck,

413
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:44,700
because in some ways,
you couldn't let go of that idea,

414
00:26:44,835 --> 00:26:46,243
that he'd walk through that door.

415
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:48,071
I'd kill him if he did.

416
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:51,232
- He did this to me.
- No, he didn't.

417
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:56,851
You're doing this to yourself...
punishing yourself or depriving yourself.

418
00:26:57,026 --> 00:26:58,902
He went out and got a life.

419
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:02,950
And your daughter's doing
the same thing today.

420
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:06,131
And I know how hard it must be for you

421
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:08,280
that she's walking out, too.

422
00:27:08,385 --> 00:27:11,413
But sitting in this car doesn't change
the fact that she is getting married.

423
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:13,902
So you want to become a part of it

424
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:16,831
or stay alone?

425
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:21,942
So...maybe your life didn't turn out
the way you thought it would.

426
00:27:22,505 --> 00:27:24,070
You can embrace this.

427
00:27:25,235 --> 00:27:28,182
Create the next step, starting today.

428
00:27:30,697 --> 00:27:33,432
Why are you afraid of being pregnant?

429
00:27:37,678 --> 00:27:38,622
I am...

430
00:27:39,837 --> 00:27:41,471
afraid that I'll fail.

431
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:43,152
I'm afraid...

432
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:47,223
that I'm not good enough.

433
00:27:48,436 --> 00:27:49,763
I'm just afraid.

434
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:57,761
But I'm not gonna let that paralyze me.

435
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:01,591
Help me.

436
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:04,771
Help me do this.

437
00:28:05,835 --> 00:28:07,280
How do I do this?

438
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:15,871
You were gone for a while.

439
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:24,050
It'll take away the pain.

440
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:28,593
You stole morphine
so you could euthanize a patient?

441
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,961
I'm a doctor, Sam.

442
00:28:30,787 --> 00:28:33,292
I'm supposed to help people manage pain,

443
00:28:33,975 --> 00:28:38,023
to beaillness, to stay healthy.
And I'm not doing any of that.

444
00:28:38,198 --> 00:28:40,400
I need...
to help him.

445
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:43,243
We need to help him.

446
00:29:05,608 --> 00:29:07,941
Pete and I are going to sit,

447
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,861
and, we're gonna talk.

448
00:29:11,758 --> 00:29:15,153
And it's possible
that we won't pay attention

449
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:17,310
to what you're doing.

450
00:29:23,187 --> 00:29:24,500
Is it enough?

451
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:27,240
It's enough.

452
00:29:42,057 --> 00:29:44,990
Better than a petite sirah, my dears.

453
00:29:45,585 --> 00:29:46,571
Well I'am.

454
00:29:57,388 --> 00:29:58,922
One step at a time.

455
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:01,771
Deep breaths.

456
00:30:05,017 --> 00:30:07,950
people are staring.
They're staring at me.

457
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:11,802
They're wondering who's walking
the mother of the bride down the aisle.

458
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:15,140
Here we go.

459
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:50,111
I did it.

460
00:30:51,745 --> 00:30:52,990
Yes, you did.

461
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:55,820
I mean her.

462
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:59,090
if I had missed this...

463
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,393
you're going to be a very good mother.

464
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,760
- I love you, honey.
- I love you.

465
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,523
You're in the closet.

466
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:47,293
I'm seeing if it's any less scary in here.

467
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:10,923
- I like it.
- Me, too.

468
00:32:16,607 --> 00:32:18,131
I'm getting married.

469
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:21,342
Tonight.

470
00:32:23,956 --> 00:32:26,330
I know, you think it's impulsive.
I think it's impulsive, too,

471
00:32:26,408 --> 00:32:29,573
but you know how...
you know how I feel about her.

472
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,061
Just ignore me.

473
00:32:32,195 --> 00:32:33,411
It'll pass.

474
00:32:35,327 --> 00:32:37,070
Me getting married is funny?

475
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,541
I mean, no.
I mean, yeah, it is.

476
00:32:39,637 --> 00:32:42,300
But no, that's...
it's just that I'm...

477
00:32:44,016 --> 00:32:46,820
- I'm pregnant.
- You're pregnant?

478
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:50,871
And I don't know who the father is.

479
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:57,900
We are two of the most emotionally
stunted people I've ever known.

480
00:32:57,987 --> 00:33:00,740
We've never made
any progress in our personal lives.

481
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:02,211
We don't do personal growth.

482
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:04,701
And now here you are getting married,
and I'm pregnant,

483
00:33:04,787 --> 00:33:07,390
and we're just growing all over the place.

484
00:33:08,498 --> 00:33:12,572
Okay, breathe. Just breathe.
Breathe, breathe.

485
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,502
let it out.

486
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,081
I love her, Violet.

487
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,513
She's hurting

488
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:32,182
 and she doesn't want to hurt,
and this will make it all go away.

489
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:34,893
A baby.

490
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:39,072
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know.

491
00:33:41,198 --> 00:33:43,762
Could we stay in the closet a little bit longer?

492
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:05,461
How's he doing?

493
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:08,653
His respiration is slowing.

494
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:10,500
It shouldn't be long.

495
00:34:13,508 --> 00:34:15,521
We're doing the right thing, Sam.

496
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:18,182
No, not that.
It's...

497
00:34:18,895 --> 00:34:21,293
What if things no were go with Sonya?

498
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:25,051
- You gettin' serious about Sonya?
- Well, any woman.

499
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:28,600
I mean, look at him.
He's all alone.

500
00:34:29,186 --> 00:34:30,110
He's me.

501
00:34:31,365 --> 00:34:33,930
He's me in, like, 40 or 50 years.

502
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:35,912
He's more me than you.

503
00:34:36,188 --> 00:34:39,140
At least you have an ex-wife, a child.
I have...

504
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:40,843
nothing.

505
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,760
Something's wrong.

506
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:54,280
My... my body feels...

507
00:34:55,776 --> 00:34:57,291
heavy... heavy.

508
00:34:57,467 --> 00:35:00,711
I don't think... something's wrong.
It's not... I know it's not right.

509
00:35:00,785 --> 00:35:02,792
Nothing's wrong.
You're dying.

510
00:35:06,156 --> 00:35:09,870
This is what it feels like
to be dying...

511
00:35:11,718 --> 00:35:13,712
I don't like it.
It's...

512
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,553
oh, I don't like it.
Make it stop.

513
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:19,401
Please make it stop.

514
00:35:19,528 --> 00:35:21,991
- I have some narcan in my bag.


515
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:24,621
- It reverses the effects of morphine.
- Make it stop.

516
00:35:24,726 --> 00:35:26,800
- It's not too late.
- Make it stop...

517
00:35:26,866 --> 00:35:28,901
Alexander, look at me.
Look at me.

518
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,072
Do you want to do this?

519
00:35:38,895 --> 00:35:39,931
But I'm...

520
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:42,750
- You're scared.
- So scared.

521
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:45,502
I know...
there's no one...

522
00:35:46,387 --> 00:35:48,480
all the people...
all...

523
00:35:49,038 --> 00:35:51,453
are on the other side.
They're all dead.

524
00:35:52,438 --> 00:35:56,483
Even when I was taking care
of my patients and watching them die,

525
00:35:56,657 --> 00:36:02,292
I never... I never knew how it was
to die... to die alone.

526
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:04,602
It's okay...

527
00:36:04,775 --> 00:36:07,092
The world is gonna spin without me.

528
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:10,230
No one will...
will remember I was here.

529
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:15,303
It's like...

530
00:36:16,415 --> 00:36:17,853
I was never here.

531
00:36:27,857 --> 00:36:29,081
You were here.

532
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,233
It's okay.

533
00:36:57,538 --> 00:36:58,612
He's gone.

534
00:37:36,065 --> 00:37:37,162
He was here.

535
00:37:39,878 --> 00:37:40,772
He was.

536
00:38:10,845 --> 00:38:13,601
Just... just make sure he studies.

537
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:17,272
Schoolwork probably won't be
his first priority.

538
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:20,043
He's got my nose, and...

539
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:22,933
my dad and my brother
have the same nose, and

540
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:25,502
none of us were very good studiers,

541
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:28,091
you're gonna have to watch him.

542
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:44,832
She's brave.

543
00:38:46,305 --> 00:38:48,372
It's hard to do the right thing.

544
00:39:00,577 --> 00:39:03,853
I let it go.
I'm not going to ask anymore.

545
00:39:05,536 --> 00:39:07,122
I'm sorry I kept asking.

546
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:11,533
I kissed another man.
Last friday.

547
00:39:11,887 --> 00:39:14,501
- I walked into his office and...
- I knew it.

548
00:39:14,675 --> 00:39:16,691
I wanted this to work, but...

549
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:19,780
- it's not working.
- Because you kissed this other man.

550
00:39:19,887 --> 00:39:21,492
No, because the kiss,

551
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:25,253
the one hour you keep asking me about,
is the one hour

552
00:39:25,427 --> 00:39:28,812
 this past month that I haven't had
a knot in my stomach.

553
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,550
It's a nice place, Addison.

554
00:39:44,945 --> 00:39:47,061
I hope you find someone who fits in.

555
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:01,053
Thong or floss?

556
00:40:05,055 --> 00:40:07,521
- You don't want to marry me.
- I want to marry you...

557
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:11,162
under a huppah with you in a big white
dress in front of everyone I know.

558
00:40:11,337 --> 00:40:13,371
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

559
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:15,422
Why not?

560
00:40:16,126 --> 00:40:17,182
Why don't you want

561
00:40:17,355 --> 00:40:20,581
any family at our wedding?
Why Vegas? Why right now?

562
00:40:20,956 --> 00:40:24,763
'Cause I can't go down an aisle
without my father. Satisfied?

563
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:31,150
because big daddy is dead, and
I won't go down an aisle without him.

564
00:40:36,628 --> 00:40:38,591
So you want to marry me or not?

565
00:40:41,165 --> 00:40:43,511
- You're grieving. You need time.
- I don't need time.

566
00:40:43,635 --> 00:40:47,222
Your wedding day should be the
happiest day of your life... our life.

567
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:51,851
And I want you beaming
when you come down that aisle.

568
00:40:51,938 --> 00:40:53,830
That's how our marriage should begin.

569
00:41:28,675 --> 00:41:29,772
Oh, my god.

570
00:41:32,307 --> 00:41:33,240
Hi, sis.

571
00:41:34,377 --> 00:41:36,392
How do you like my new office?
