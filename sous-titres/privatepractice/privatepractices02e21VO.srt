1
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:24,765
No. In and out.

2
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,318
You gotta breathe in, too,
not just out. In.

3
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:31,023
In... Okay, not...

4
00:00:31,477 --> 00:00:34,427
not like a vacuum cleaner.
Like a normal person.

5
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:35,702
Relax.

6
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:39,556
That's easy for you to say. You're not
gonna have 8 pounds of flesh and bones

7
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:41,651
- coming out of your...
- kay, I don't...

8
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:44,264
- no visual.
- This is visual enough for me.

9
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:46,796
The point of me staying over
wasn't to wake up next to a pillow.

10
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:49,640
- You can always leave.
- I know, but I agree to adult

11
00:00:49,764 --> 00:00:51,175
sleepovers in this carnival

12
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:54,139
because I get my itches scratched
when the sun comes up,

13
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:56,419
- usually.
- Charlotte, I will be...

14
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,392
- right there.
- I'm going back to the room.

15
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:00,810
If you're not there
by the time I'm naked...

16
00:01:02,617 --> 00:01:04,311
Come on. She's bluffing.

17
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:09,890
Keep breathing.

18
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:14,923
Thank you.

19
00:01:16,757 --> 00:01:19,373
- No Phillip today?
- He couldn't get off work.

20
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:23,000
On the upside, he promises me
a bigger budget for the baby's room.

21
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:26,451
But I don't mind. It's not his thing.
Malcolm's better at it.

22
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:28,571
One of the perks of being a nurse...

23
00:01:28,698 --> 00:01:30,792
I get to fill in for my brother.

24
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:33,993
- Sorry I'm late.
- Again.

25
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:36,842
- We'll talk about this later.
- Hey, Malcolm.

26
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:38,321
Fellow nurse man.

27
00:01:38,636 --> 00:01:40,692
She fires you, we'll take
our business elsewhere.

28
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:42,710
How long have you been like this,
short of breath?

29
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:43,610
A week maybe.

30
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:46,192
I walk up a flight of stairs,
and I feel like I need to take a nap.

31
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:48,602
Since Phillip has diabetes,
do you think this is related?

32
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:51,381
- Gestational diabetes or something?
- No, there's no association.

33
00:01:51,517 --> 00:01:54,610
Your blood sugar's fine.
Let me just have you sit up.

34
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:56,930
Well, maybe it's the baby weight.

35
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:59,750
I mean, look at me.
I'm as wide as a highway.

36
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:01,222
You're beautiful.

37
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,492
I'm gonna listen to your lungs.
Deep breath.

38
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:06,420
Good. Again.

39
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:09,610
What?

40
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:12,360
- What is it?
- Dell, get an ambulance for me.

41
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:13,850
I don't want you to panic,

42
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:15,852
but I hear a little bit of fluid
in your lungs,

43
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:18,630
which could indicate
a problem with your heart.

44
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,360
- Phillip... is he here yet?
- I called him. He's on his way.

45
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:28,382
Oh, perfect.

46
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:31,760
There are 40 heart surgeons
in this hospital.

47
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:34,570
I didn't know this was your case.
I just responded to the page.

48
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:37,611
So did you get a chance
to look at my patient's echo?

49
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:39,781
Diffuse myocardial dysfunction.

50
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:41,872
- See, that wall's barely moving.
- Oh, my God.

51
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,871
- Both mom and baby could die.
- I'll do everything I can to save them.

52
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:51,451
Doctors thinks H.M.O.'s
are about denying health care,

53
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,681
about how little help
you can give people who are sick.

54
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:55,663
While H.M.O.'s make a mint.

55
00:02:56,215 --> 00:02:58,233
You're right,
most doctors do think that.

56
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:00,303
- I think that.
- Thank you.

57
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:02,650
You know how few people
would say that to my face?

58
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:05,823
You... know, you're... very charming,
but I'm... I'm just...

59
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,610
Thank you.
I'm having a hard time figuring out

60
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:10,583
what you think I can do for you.
I mean, my...

61
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:12,882
practice is never gonna be
part of an H.M.O., not ever.

62
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:14,612
Good. Neither would I.

63
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:17,162
I got out.

64
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:19,441
- Took the money and ran.
- Ah, you proud of that?

65
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:21,991
Most of my life I've been a rich ass.

66
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:25,051
Then over the past year,
I watched my best friend die...

67
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:25,981
A.L.S.

68
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:27,953
He suffered...
a lot.

69
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:30,433
Medicine failed him.

70
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:32,153
I failed him,

71
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,043
and it changed me.

72
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:40,832
I want to start
a state-of-the-art medical practice,

73
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:43,733
change the way medicine works,
change the way doctors work.

74
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:46,222
I'm not at liberty
to discuss details, but...

75
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:48,311
I want you to run it.

76
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:52,152
Mr. White, I'm...
well, I'm very flattered, but I...

77
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:54,860
It's William, and...
and just hear me out.

78
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:56,512
I've done my homework, Naomi.

79
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,541
You are the preeminent
fertility specialist in the area,

80
00:03:59,678 --> 00:04:02,812
you helped fund one of the first
whole wellness practices,

81
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:05,712
and in the past year,
you've had to deal with finances and

82
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:08,790
internal power struggles. It's not
even really your practice anymore.

83
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,791
- It's... still my practice.
- Maybe,

84
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,613
but is it what you want?

85
00:04:12,748 --> 00:04:15,132
What if you had access
to cutting-edge technology,

86
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,122
to the best scientists
and researchers

87
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:19,741
at your fingertips?

88
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:22,130
Top doctors in
every specialty under one roof?

89
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:24,321
- I have the best doctors now.
- Think bigger, Naomi.

90
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:26,002
I'm talking about,

91
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:29,600
say, the guy who created
the first embryonic stem cell.

92
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:32,443
I'm talking about giving full wellness
care to people who can't afford it.

93
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:35,553
You set the agenda, then hire whoever
you want to make it work

94
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:37,641
so you can focus on what you do...

95
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,953
being a doctor,

96
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:40,170
making life.

97
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:45,672
You know, my ex-husband and I
built our practice from the ground up.

98
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:46,681
And...

99
00:04:46,815 --> 00:04:47,992
leaving it, is...

100
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:50,162
it's something
I would never entertain.

101
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:52,831
Entertain it now.

102
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,141
I'm offering you the chance to do
what you've always wanted to do

103
00:04:56,277 --> 00:04:57,500
with no money worries.

104
00:04:58,248 --> 00:04:59,743
What's the downside?

105
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:04,100
<i>Private Practice S02E21
What you do for love</i>

106
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,101
Hey, Nai. You...
you free for lunch today?

107
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:13,500
Maya hit me up this morning about
taking her someplace cool for summer.

108
00:05:13,628 --> 00:05:15,780
I'm thinking we could...
figure out our summer schedules.

109
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,971
No, I can't.
How about tomorrow?

110
00:05:18,106 --> 00:05:20,061
You having lunch
with Duncan again?

111
00:05:20,198 --> 00:05:21,402
No. I just... I'm busy.

112
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:25,251
Is everything okay?

113
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:26,701
Yeah. Everything's great.

114
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:30,950
Thank you.

115
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:42,672
I know testing urine is a crappy job,
but jeez, Sam, lighten up.

116
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,163
What is it, another U.T.I.?

117
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:48,080
Well, yeah, you do have
a urinary tract infection,

118
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:51,193
but you also tested positive
for chlamydia.

119
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:53,882
Now the good news is
that it's treatable,

120
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:56,232
so I'm gonna give you a prescription

121
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:58,451
for sulfa for the U.T.I.

122
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:01,270
And doxycycline for the chlamydia.

123
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:07,132
Now do you have any idea
how you might have contracted this?

124
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:10,420
Bill.

125
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:14,200
- He's been cheating for a while.
- I'm sorry.

126
00:06:16,098 --> 00:06:17,771
How did I let my marriage
come to this?

127
00:06:18,015 --> 00:06:19,190
This is not your fault.

128
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:22,600
Now if you need help
in dealing with this...

129
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:24,173
I'll figure it out.

130
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:26,233
That's what I do. I

131
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,661
figure things out.
I always tell my students,

132
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:30,343
stay focused on the problem,

133
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:32,552
the answer will be clear.

134
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:36,522
I need to get away...

135
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,732
from Bill.

136
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,373
It sounds so easy to say, doesn't it?

137
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:46,322
Well, it's tough to know
when you're ready for it to be over.

138
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:51,343
Well, I better pull myself together
and get back to school.

139
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:52,823
Donna, if...

140
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,210
No, just... give me the prescription.
I'm gonna be okay.

141
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:56,132
Okay.

142
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:05,580
Big Ben has a big appetite.

143
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,210
- I'm an eating machine.
- Six slices. Up here.

144
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:11,305
Thank you so much.
That was yummy.

145
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:13,119
Sorry, ma'am.

146
00:07:13,837 --> 00:07:15,759
Excuse him.
Somebody calls me "ma'am,"

147
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,121
- I just want to choke them.
- Oh, that's okay. I've been...

148
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:19,892
I've been called worse.

149
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:22,591
Lisa, this is Violet.
Violet, Lisa.

150
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:24,271
Hi. Nice to meet you.

151
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:26,600
How many weeks are you?

152
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,712
- 35-ish?
- Well, you've got the glow.

153
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:31,361
Being a parent, nothing compares.

154
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:33,153
So I've heard.

155
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,120
I'm really looking forward to it.

156
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:38,702
See you later?

157
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:43,532
Nice. She's...

158
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:46,323
I like her.

159
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:51,383
You need help with that box?

160
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:56,553
- Her heart's just not working anymore?
- It's called cardiomyopathy.

161
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:58,312
The heart muscle becomes inflamed.

162
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:01,153
In this case, the added pressure
on Janine's heart from the baby

163
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:03,342
caused it to progress rapidly.

164
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:06,021
From all the tests, it looks like
it's been going on for a while.

165
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:08,332
I'm afraid that the damage
is irreversible.

166
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:11,260
You didn't see this?
You've been there.

167
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:12,801
- Honey...
- You're my brother.

168
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,370
- You're blaming me for this?
- Come on, stop. It's nobody's fault.

169
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:18,182
Janine's right. I think
we need to focus on the solution.

170
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:21,413
- So what do we do?
- She is going to need a new heart.

171
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:22,942
Oh, my God.

172
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:24,992
I'm gonna die.

173
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:28,090
No, that's what you're telling me.
I'm pregnant and I'm going to die.

174
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:29,520
How fast can we get a heart?

175
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:33,503
We need to notify U.N.O.S.,
get her on a list. It could take time.

176
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:36,581
- How long can her heart hold out?
- It's impossible to tell,

177
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:40,683
but not for long. The pregnancy
is making your heart work harder,

178
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:42,001
which is why,

179
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:45,540
Janine, I think that you need
to consider termination.

180
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:50,041
Janine, at 20 weeks,
the baby can't survive,

181
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:52,230
and we need to relieve
some of the pressure on your heart

182
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:54,582
- until we find a new one.
- She kicks.

183
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:57,373
She kicks me.
She's alive in there.

184
00:08:57,508 --> 00:08:58,351
Please.

185
00:08:58,878 --> 00:09:00,500
We can't take that kind of risk.

186
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:03,170
Janine, I want this baby
as much as you,

187
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:05,102
but we need to buy you more time.

188
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:06,643
You're not listening, Phil.

189
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:09,753
- She doesn't want to lose the baby.
- No, I can't lose the baby.

190
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:11,712
You have to save us both.

191
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:13,551
I'm begging you.

192
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:18,753
Hey, Bobby.

193
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:20,932
- Bobby, it's Dr. Cooper.
- My body's on fire.

194
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:22,931
Okay, you're having
a severe allergic reaction.

195
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,631
We need to figure out
what you've been exposed to,

196
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:25,860
so where have you been,
what have you been eating?

197
00:09:25,885 --> 00:09:27,823
- I don't know.
- Bobby, you're gonna have to try

198
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,821
to do better than that.
Look, if you took something

199
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:31,343
you weren't supposed to,
you're not gonna get in any trouble

200
00:09:31,386 --> 00:09:33,070
but you need to tell me.

201
00:09:34,298 --> 00:09:36,553
Look, you need to check him for pills,
check his pockets,

202
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,443
check everything he came
in here with.

203
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,422
Draw up 125 solu-medrol
and 50 of diphenhydramine.

204
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:45,370
Is he gonna be okay?
I'm Bobby's teacher. I found him.

205
00:09:45,508 --> 00:09:47,183
Did you see anything
when you found him?

206
00:09:47,306 --> 00:09:49,921
- Has he been taking anything?
- Mrs. Keating, thank you.

207
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:51,452
Is bobby okay?

208
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:53,503
He's having a severe allergic
reaction to something.

209
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,971
We're trying to figure out what.
He's in here. You should go in.

210
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:03,873
- What's... going on?
- My student, he's in there.

211
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,281
The sulfa you gave me,
and the doxycycline,

212
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,722
I gave him both, and he's reacting. You
have to tell the doctor what he took.

213
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:12,581
- No. Donna...
- You can't tell them.

214
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:14,690
You can't tell them
Bobby and I are...

215
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:17,770
I'm sleeping with one
of my students.

216
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:22,642
She's not a vulture.
She's not a predator.

217
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:24,671
- She was confused.
- I have no sympathy,

218
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:26,372
- except for the boy.
- How's Bobby?

219
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:28,603
He's, you know, he's stabilized.

220
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:30,881
He's alert.
The rash is not progressing.

221
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:33,422
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome?
- Yeah, he reacted to the sulfa.

222
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:35,150
He's lucky. People can't just

223
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:36,440
give other people
their prescriptions.

224
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:39,010
She was trying to help him.
What did he end up telling his parents?

225
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:41,730
He said that a friend gave him some
pills so he could stay awake, study.

226
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,601
Now they're just happy
that he's doing better.

227
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:45,560
Bobby is a minor.
This is statutory rape.

228
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:48,680
She should not have slept with her
student, all right? Absolutely not.

229
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:51,562
But he's gonna be 18 in what,
like, a month?

230
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:53,252
You spoke to him.
It was consensual.

231
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,241
I mean, he said he made
the first move, but...

232
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:56,901
That does not absolve her,

233
00:10:57,035 --> 00:11:00,510
and it doesn't absolve you of your legal
duty to report this, to protect him.

234
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:03,142
But in a few weeks,
it won't be a crime.

235
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:06,032
What good is it gonna do
either of them if I report this?

236
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,890
She's gonna lose her job,
her credentials.

237
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:10,872
- He's gonna end up humiliated...
- He'll be a rock star.

238
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,882
- Mary Kay Letourneau... hot.
- That boy was 13 years old.

239
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:17,810
So by comparison,
Sam's patient's done nothing wrong.

240
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:20,690
What... 17 year old hasn't wanted
to sleep with one of his teachers?

241
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:22,830
Donna was in a position of power,

242
00:11:22,968 --> 00:11:24,892
- and she abused that.
- Why assume a 17 year old

243
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:25,963
isn't mature enough
to know what he wants?

244
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:28,173
Because he's being forced
to grow up too quickly, to...

245
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:31,173
to make decisions about his life
that he's just not ready to make.

246
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:33,573
- Think about yourself at 17.
- I was mature, all right?

247
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:37,200
Heather wasn't. But thank you, Naomi,
for the free therapy.

248
00:11:39,788 --> 00:11:41,110
All right, if this were Maya,

249
00:11:41,248 --> 00:11:44,212
- and a 35-year-old male gym teacher...
- Well, I would kill him,

250
00:11:44,347 --> 00:11:47,181
but that's not the... look, I know that
there's a double standard here,

251
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:49,292
but it's different when it's a girl.
It... It is.

252
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:51,350
- It shouldn't be.
- Look, I hate abuse,

253
00:11:52,148 --> 00:11:54,231
but I don't think that's what
we're dealing with here.

254
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:55,701
Donna is not a criminal.

255
00:11:55,826 --> 00:11:57,803
Now as long as she doesn't
see him again,

256
00:11:57,938 --> 00:11:59,383
that's all we want,

257
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:00,453
isn't it?

258
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:04,091
Even if she gets the new heart,

259
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:05,473
he won't look after her.

260
00:12:05,777 --> 00:12:07,202
He's not gonna take care of her.

261
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:10,383
- You're talking about Phillip?
- He sends me in his place.

262
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:13,741
Who does that? Even now,
he's in the lobby on his Blackberry.

263
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:15,742
This is his baby, his wife.

264
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:18,892
He should be here for her,
you know?

265
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:20,523
There still isn't a heart, but

266
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:22,122
Janine is at the top of the list.

267
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:24,553
I've also got a call in
to the head of U.N.O.S.

268
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,510
Janine's blood type "O," so am I.
It's the most common.

269
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:29,613
- It shouldn't be so hard.
- That works in her favor,

270
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:32,003
but organ donation
is a difficult process.

271
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:34,552
- Supply can't meet the demand.
- I want to do something.

272
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,062
If I could... give her my heart...

273
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:38,733
We're gonna find you one.

274
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:41,422
How long do Janine and the baby have
to find a heart

275
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,392
before they die?

276
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:46,452
48 hours.

277
00:12:57,495 --> 00:13:00,611
- Isn't that someone else's job?
- I can't stop. Nesting.

278
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:03,870
I see mess or clutter
or things out of place...

279
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:08,513
She seems nice.

280
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:12,040
- Lisa. And her kid is cute.
- Yeah, I like them.

281
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:15,613
What? What's wrong?

282
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:18,242
I just...
I hate it that you're maybe

283
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:20,091
carrying my baby,
and I didn't tell her.

284
00:13:20,226 --> 00:13:22,901
- Do you think you should?
- You think I shouldn't?

285
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:26,321
you're happy. And I'm all
for full disclosure, but

286
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:28,070
do you think you should
tell her something

287
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:29,641
before there's anything to tell?

288
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:36,291
Sorry, Pete. Were...
you two in the middle of a...

289
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:37,693
Just finishing.

290
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:45,311
- Are those for me?
- No, for me, from a patient.

291
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:47,903
She's in love with me.

292
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:50,260
Her name is Anita.

293
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:53,662
I started treating her a few months ago.
She was painfully shy.

294
00:13:54,227 --> 00:13:56,790
She wanted me to help her
be more assertive with a coworker

295
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:59,813
she had fallen in love with...
you know, she...

296
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:01,441
she didn't know how to talk to him.

297
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,491
And as she realized
how easy it was to talk to you,

298
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,151
- she channeled her love to you.
- Classic transference.

299
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:07,132
Clearly.

300
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:09,802
- You... don't have to say it like that.
- Like what?

301
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:12,352
Like a woman couldn't fall
in love with me unless it was a

302
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,402
- therapeutic mistake.
- I didn't say that.

303
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:16,671
I can be very charming, you know.

304
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:18,623
I know.

305
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:21,711
Well... I was just saying that...
that it happens,

306
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:23,832
that it's part of the process.

307
00:14:25,186 --> 00:14:26,822
Are you having your own feelings?

308
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:29,950
This is not about
countertransference.

309
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:32,363
I mean, granted, my love life is...

310
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:33,632
At best,

311
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:36,031
complicated right now, but

312
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,840
I just wanted to talk
to a colleague, I guess,

313
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:42,662
go on record if nothing else.
But also to see if you had any...

314
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:44,512
secrets.

315
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:48,901
I hate to fail.

316
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:51,881
I think, you won't

317
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:53,281
fail.

318
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:56,602
She's... lucky to have you, Sheldon.

319
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:05,021
And can you really blame her?

320
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:16,871
Dell, I'm going out for lunch, so if

321
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:19,533
my 2:00 gets here before I do, will you
just put her in a room for me?

322
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:21,010
What else would I do?

323
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:26,131
Later, we're...
gonna have a talk.

324
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:30,050
- And I mean a come-to-Jesus talk.
- You're not my mother, Naomi.

325
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:32,282
You're not even my boss.

326
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:38,960
Everybody's patience
is wearing thin, Dell.

327
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:43,522
- What?
- Hey.

328
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:46,621
Naomi won't push this.
I will. Leave.

329
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:49,710
Take the day.
Get it together, Dell.

330
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:55,912
I'd just found out
about Bill's affair...

331
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:57,633
from his e-mail.

332
00:15:58,918 --> 00:16:01,000
There were lots of e-mails
from different women

333
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,271
and pictures.

334
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,770
They were all so young.

335
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:09,340
And I was feeling old...
and insecure.

336
00:16:09,675 --> 00:16:10,463
And Bobby?

337
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,891
He just got ansferred into my class.

338
00:16:13,736 --> 00:16:15,983
The way he looked at me, it just...

339
00:16:17,098 --> 00:16:18,870
it just made me feel better.

340
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:22,430
He'd find reasons to stay after,
and I'd help him with his homework.

341
00:16:22,558 --> 00:16:25,600
When we wanted a break,
we'd just start talking...

342
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,510
for hours.

343
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:30,780
I tried to get him to focus
on girls his own age.

344
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:33,763
- He kept coming back to me.
- I know, but you're the adult.

345
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:36,153
- You should've stopped him.
- I love him.

346
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:39,001
Look, I know it's wrong,

347
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:41,700
but when I thought something was
gonna happen to him in the hospital...

348
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:43,120
This is a crime,

349
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:44,861
and we should be reporting it.

350
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:47,752
Yeah, bottom line... you...
can't see him anymore. If you do...

351
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:48,923
Yeah, don't.

352
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:53,022
Okay.

353
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:11,470
I hate heart transplants.

354
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:13,410
You're basically waiting
for someone to die

355
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:16,832
to save the person who you want
to live. It's horrible.

356
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:18,833
To have to sit and wait and...

357
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:21,162
- sit...
- And not be in control.

358
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:24,242
You can only do so much.

359
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:27,413
And if... you've got a baby,

360
00:17:27,857 --> 00:17:30,941
a baby who could die, you're content
to just chalk it all up to fate?

361
00:17:33,326 --> 00:17:35,320
- Then it's on me.
- Exactly.

362
00:17:35,897 --> 00:17:37,992
We are the ultimate narcissists.

363
00:17:38,536 --> 00:17:40,172
Life and death is all up to us.

364
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:42,153
No wonder so many doctors are

365
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,561
insufferable.

366
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:45,253
Am i?

367
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,770
I think you're one of the good ones.

368
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:01,550
When they brought him in,
I recognized him and I paged you.

369
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:03,972
It's Phillip, Janine's husband.

370
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,302
He's comatose, no corneal reflexes.

371
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:13,151
Type 2 diabetic.
Tox screen was negative.

372
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:15,913
- What happened?
- Glucose was initially less than 10.

373
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:20,083
Looks like an insulin overdose. E.E.G.
shows no evidence of any brain activity.

374
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:22,260
He's brain dead. Oh, my God.
Do you think...

375
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:24,673
What?

376
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,642
He's an organ donor.

377
00:18:41,238 --> 00:18:43,782
- Can I help you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

378
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:47,340
I like the atmosphere...
open, friendly, comfortable.

379
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:50,022
What are you doing here?
I told you I was not interested.

380
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:52,461
I figured I'd check out exactly
what you're holding on to.

381
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,141
Well, that's not
a very good idea, so...

382
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:57,540
Because of the other Dr. Bennett?

383
00:18:57,906 --> 00:19:01,142
I read his book. Don't worry.
As far as he knows, I'm a patient.

384
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:05,252
I doubt he thinks that I'm trying to
get you pregnant, and... you should go.

385
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:06,921
Lunch tomorrow?

386
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:11,321
- You are pushing.
- I'm a man who knows what he wants.

387
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:19,233
- Aren't you popular these days?
- What?

388
00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:24,683
- The guy you were just talking to.
- No. He's just... he's a patient, so...

389
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:26,563
Good night, Sam.

390
00:19:27,215 --> 00:19:28,261
Good night.

391
00:19:30,438 --> 00:19:31,433
I can't...

392
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:33,433
I can't breathe.

393
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:34,543
I can't think.

394
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:36,813
What am I gonna do without Phillip?

395
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:39,742
Janine, I know this is
unthinkably hard,

396
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,812
and none of us could possibly

397
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:43,861
imagine.
It... it's awful.

398
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:45,510
But I need you to focus right now.

399
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:47,691
I need you to focus on the baby
that you're carrying,

400
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:49,842
the baby that you
and Phillip created,

401
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:52,962
because if you don't do this,
you both could die.

402
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:54,751
My husband is dead.

403
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:58,783
And you want me to take his heart
to save myself?

404
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,100
- To save both of you.
- I can't.

405
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:02,612
How could I?

406
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:05,753
Janine, listen to me,
it's hard for anyone to fathom,

407
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,841
but the heart is a machine.

408
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,331
A heart is tissue that provides
a hugely important function.

409
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:13,111
It is not your husband.

410
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:16,382
You're not taking from him.
He is providing for you.

411
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:17,832
It's what he'd want.

412
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:19,203
You know it is.

413
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:23,313
Phillip's death is tragic,
but it's giving you a chance.

414
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,441
Now you need to get over your fear

415
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:27,730
and do this,
if not for you, for the baby.

416
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,222
And for you.

417
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:32,200
He's my brother.

418
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:35,280
And I haven't even digested that,

419
00:20:35,696 --> 00:20:36,693
because...

420
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:40,943
I know that there's something
more important right now.

421
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:42,921
We can't save him.

422
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:45,532
We can save you.

423
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:52,273
Once the heart's out, we've got
four to six hours to get it in.

424
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:54,302
Montgomery, Barnes, hold it.

425
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:57,773
Don't you dare touch him.
You're not removing his heart.

426
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:03,603
How is she?

427
00:21:03,815 --> 00:21:04,612
Donna?

428
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:06,623
I don't know.

429
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:09,122
You know, we need to focus on you.
We're gonna get you better.

430
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:11,161
I keep texting her.
She won't answer.

431
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:14,472
You know, I get it, Bobby.
People fall for their teachers.

432
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,100
It wasn't like that. I didn't have,
like, a crush on her or anything.

433
00:21:17,237 --> 00:21:19,883
We started talking,
and it was real.

434
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:23,283
I mean, have you ever talked
to a teenage girl, Dr. Freedman?

435
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:26,270
It's like deciphering code.
This was a real conversation.

436
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:30,862
- Even so, given the age difference...
- Why are people so hung up on age?

437
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:31,863
Donna.

438
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:35,463
- You're not supposed to be here.
- I know. I just...

439
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,413
Hey, could you give us a minute?

440
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:40,262
- No, I really can't.
- Please.

441
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:42,380
- We had a deal.
- I want you to go.

442
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:46,930
- Mrs. Keating?
- I just wanted to...

443
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,300
make sure Bobby was feeling better.

444
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:52,571
- Dr. Freedman, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

445
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:54,141
She's here to see me.

446
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:56,731
I think you need to go, Donna, now.

447
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:00,502
I never meant to hurt him.

448
00:22:00,628 --> 00:22:02,681
- I don't understand.
- I love her.

449
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:05,602
- You're sleeping with our son?
- Leave, now.

450
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,453
- I'm sorry.
- Now.

451
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:20,760
What?

452
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:26,061
You know the woman you met
this morning... Violet...

453
00:22:26,518 --> 00:22:27,962
the pregnant woman?

454
00:22:28,088 --> 00:22:28,883
Yeah.

455
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:31,283
We're... we're not together,

456
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:33,940
but...

457
00:22:35,568 --> 00:22:37,660
there's a... chance that it's...

458
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:39,702
My baby.

459
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:41,960
Look, I...

460
00:22:42,097 --> 00:22:42,941
I like you,

461
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:45,380
and I want
to start things off being open.

462
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:48,412
She doesn't know who the father is?

463
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,670
You know...

464
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:53,362
It's a long story.

465
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:57,402
What are you thinking?

466
00:22:57,527 --> 00:22:59,311
Do you know how hard it is
for a single mom

467
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:02,082
to find a man who's smart
and funny and...

468
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:04,480
likes kids,

469
00:23:05,196 --> 00:23:07,290
someone who likes me and my son,

470
00:23:07,498 --> 00:23:09,993
who doesn't just
think he's in the way?

471
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:18,622
I like you, Pete.

472
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:20,602
This feels good

473
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:21,973
and right.

474
00:23:22,106 --> 00:23:24,251
So it's not the end of the world.

475
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:27,661
But I have Ben,

476
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:29,883
and I have to protect him.

477
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:32,762
So I guess what I really
need to know is,

478
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,123
what are you thinking?

479
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:43,901
Where's your head at, Montgomery?
Woman needs a heart, can't find one.

480
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:45,993
Suddenly her husband drops dead.
Bam, you got one.

481
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:47,242
Awfully convenient.

482
00:23:47,366 --> 00:23:49,850
Yes, it's very coincidental, Charlotte,
and perhaps we could ponder

483
00:23:49,985 --> 00:23:52,180
just how coincidental it is
if we had time,

484
00:23:52,315 --> 00:23:54,490
- but we don't.
- His wife is deteriorating.

485
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:57,490
She needs that heart now.
If we wait, she'll die.

486
00:23:57,618 --> 00:24:00,143
Insulin overdose is a well-known
cause of death in diabetics.

487
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:02,471
Accidental overdose or on purpose?

488
00:24:02,726 --> 00:24:05,761
Because this hospital will not condone
suicide to provide organs

489
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:08,900
or be party to destroying evidence
if it wasn't an accident.

490
00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:11,111
I want someone here
from the M.E.'s office

491
00:24:11,235 --> 00:24:13,710
to collect trace evidence from the body
and find me a cause of death

492
00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:14,940
before you touch him.

493
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:17,230
If that man was murdered,
and you destroy evidence

494
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,371
- We don't have time, Charlotte.
- Well, make time.

495
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:21,783
I'm not letting a murderer get away
just so you can have his heart.

496
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,741
- You've got to go home.
- I know,

497
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:37,462
but I can't. He needs me.
I need him.

498
00:24:37,598 --> 00:24:39,291
No, this has got to end.

499
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:41,060
Now his parents are...

500
00:24:41,946 --> 00:24:44,063
- What were you thinking?
- I screwed up, Sam.

501
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:46,582
You ever do that? You see the train
wreck and you just keep going

502
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,700
because it makes you forget...

503
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,190
- everything?
- We all do,

504
00:24:50,316 --> 00:24:51,703
but you've gotta turn back.

505
00:24:51,836 --> 00:24:53,930
- You gotta turn back now.
- Donna Keating?

506
00:24:54,065 --> 00:24:55,391
- Yes.
- You're under arrest

507
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:56,972
for statutory rape.

508
00:24:57,347 --> 00:24:58,891
You have the right to remain silent.

509
00:24:59,025 --> 00:25:01,650
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

510
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:11,252
He's been in there
for over an hour, Charlotte.

511
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:12,713
You gotta get him outta here.

512
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:14,631
You need to wait.
He's doing his job.

513
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:18,301
- Her pressure's dropping.
- Baby's showing signs of distress.

514
00:25:18,438 --> 00:25:19,553
We gotta do this now.

515
00:25:24,587 --> 00:25:26,773
- Do you have everything you need?
- I'll be done shortly.

516
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:29,600
You've taken his blood, you've taken
photos, you've scoured his entire body.

517
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,110
Can't you get the rest of what you need
after we take the heart?

518
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:36,980
- I'll take that as a yes.
- Charlotte?

519
00:25:37,585 --> 00:25:38,581
Charlotte.

520
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:41,202
- Do it.
- Let's go.

521
00:25:41,337 --> 00:25:45,133
I'm gonna scrub in. Have him ready
for incision in three minutes.

522
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:01,681
- Love is a bitch.
- For you or for lolita's brother?

523
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,872
I know this is crazy, but...

524
00:26:04,215 --> 00:26:07,432
- I think Donna really loves him.
- Turning into a romantic?

525
00:26:07,557 --> 00:26:09,452
I've always been a romantic.

526
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,192
Oh, now that... really hurts.
That really hurts me.

527
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:18,951
- You can take it.
- No. I'm talking to you.

528
00:26:19,088 --> 00:26:20,931
What? It's... polite. What?

529
00:26:28,555 --> 00:26:30,790
Who was that guy
by the elevator last night?

530
00:26:31,228 --> 00:26:32,770
What are you talking about?

531
00:26:32,908 --> 00:26:34,001
Woman, look,

532
00:26:34,397 --> 00:26:36,210
I was married to you for 12 years,
all right?

533
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:38,550
I know when you're hiding
something from me.

534
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:41,392
I mean, if you want
to blow off Duncan, I'm all for it.

535
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:42,513
Just don't

536
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:45,183
- hide it from me.
- Duncan and I are fine.

537
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:51,002
I thought we were good...

538
00:26:51,686 --> 00:26:53,841
- Telling each other everything.
- We're good,

539
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,041
- All right... Okay.
- We are. We're good.

540
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,360
His airways are clear
and there's no indication

541
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:03,362
of any residual damage
from the asthma attacks.

542
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:04,271
Awesome.

543
00:27:04,407 --> 00:27:06,912
- I can go to soccer today?
- Rest the engines, bud.

544
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:08,333
Next week, okay?

545
00:27:11,927 --> 00:27:13,931
I didn't mean to put pressure on you
last night.

546
00:27:14,057 --> 00:27:14,810
I just...

547
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:17,033
I think you're a good guy. And...

548
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:20,111
you told me the truth.
I really appreciate that.

549
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:21,981
I just want this to work.

550
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,272
I... just came to...
check up on you...

551
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,602
But... wow.
She really loves you.

552
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:45,300
- She has dreams about me.
- Sex dreams?

553
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,941
I thought I was making progress.
We went over it yesterday.

554
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,020
But then Anita says that we've been
so close for so long,

555
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:56,163
she can't stand not expressing
what she feels anymore.

556
00:27:56,298 --> 00:27:59,691
And that it may seem crazy to me,
but she wants me bad...

557
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:01,543
so damn bad.

558
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,402
- I'm quoting her.
- That's excellent, Sheldon.

559
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:07,032
Now you're mocking me.

560
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,673
No, she's saying to you
what she can't say to her coworker.

561
00:28:09,796 --> 00:28:11,610
You know, you have to get her
to talk to him.

562
00:28:11,748 --> 00:28:14,452
If she has feelings, and she
doesn't tell the other person,

563
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:16,370
it's a missed opportunity.

564
00:28:17,387 --> 00:28:18,982
You know what, Violet?

565
00:28:19,857 --> 00:28:22,203
- You're good.
- Clearly so are you.

566
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:27,322
I'm scared.

567
00:28:27,448 --> 00:28:29,952
Dr. Barnes says the heart's taking.
You can do this, Janine.

568
00:28:30,086 --> 00:28:31,603
You and the baby are gonna be fine.

569
00:28:31,725 --> 00:28:32,920
It's not that.

570
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:34,363
It's Malcolm.

571
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:36,062
He's been there for me.

572
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:39,911
Everything I've ever needed,
every time I've needed anything.

573
00:28:40,858 --> 00:28:42,511
He would do anything for me.

574
00:28:42,635 --> 00:28:45,433
- Well, why does that scare you?
- I think...

575
00:28:46,988 --> 00:28:48,431
I know he loves me.

576
00:28:50,678 --> 00:28:52,421
But he's in love with me.

577
00:28:53,397 --> 00:28:56,442
He's never done anything
or said anything, just...

578
00:28:58,507 --> 00:28:59,803
Phillip is gone.

579
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:04,061
And I needed a heart,

580
00:29:04,588 --> 00:29:06,181
and then phillip died.

581
00:29:06,668 --> 00:29:10,761
Look, I don't want to think it.
I don't even want to believe it, but...

582
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:13,452
do you think malcolm killed him

583
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:15,392
for me?

584
00:29:24,427 --> 00:29:26,121
What are you doing here?

585
00:29:26,258 --> 00:29:29,001
I didn't feel like being
at the office, and,

586
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:32,283
you know, I heard about Phillip. I wanted
to see how Malcolm was, ans Janine.

587
00:29:33,116 --> 00:29:34,462
Something happen?

588
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:36,730
Janine...

589
00:29:37,886 --> 00:29:39,852
thinks that phillip's death...
that...

590
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:41,620
she thinks that Malcolm

591
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,343
may have killed him.

592
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:46,292
She says that Malcolm's
in love with her.

593
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:48,462
Well, yeah, I mean,
I could've told you that part.

594
00:29:48,498 --> 00:29:50,460
- What, you didn't see it?
- I don't know. I gu...

595
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,942
- I mean, he's good to her, but...
- Well, he's also a nurse, so...

596
00:29:53,078 --> 00:29:54,711
he'd know how much insulin to use.

597
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,162
I mean, he'd know what they'd look for,
what would look normal.

598
00:29:57,185 --> 00:29:58,773
We're talking about Phillip's brother.

599
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:01,452
No, we're talking about watching someone
slip away, someone that you love.

600
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:05,400
William, I...

601
00:30:05,885 --> 00:30:07,120
I am flattered.

602
00:30:07,698 --> 00:30:10,842
I really am. But you're asking me
to orphan my baby,

603
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:12,020
and I can't.

604
00:30:12,156 --> 00:30:15,801
Oceanside is not just a job.
These people are my family, so...

605
00:30:15,926 --> 00:30:17,471
I saw that yesterday,

606
00:30:17,706 --> 00:30:19,402
and while I admire it...

607
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:21,683
I have to think of my own family.

608
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:23,153
I love them,

609
00:30:23,276 --> 00:30:25,813
which is why I live 3,000 miles away
from them...

610
00:30:25,937 --> 00:30:27,553
So they don't interfere with my life.

611
00:30:27,688 --> 00:30:30,033
Well, Sam's not like that.
We are...

612
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:32,750
I can tell him anything.

613
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:34,583
Does he know you're here?

614
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,040
There's no one else on my list,
Dr. Bennett.

615
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:41,360
I'll be back in two weeks
to make an official offer.

616
00:30:51,246 --> 00:30:53,691
- Is everything all right?
- My husband posted bail.

617
00:30:53,828 --> 00:30:55,170
His parting gift.

618
00:30:55,298 --> 00:30:56,692
He's done with me.

619
00:30:56,895 --> 00:30:58,732
I'm sorry.
Come to my office.

620
00:31:00,978 --> 00:31:01,773
What?

621
00:31:02,386 --> 00:31:03,433
It's Bobby.

622
00:31:04,215 --> 00:31:06,522
He says he wants us
to go off together,

623
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:09,231
that he doesn't care about his parents,
school, anything.

624
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:11,793
All he cares about is us,
me.

625
00:31:12,626 --> 00:31:14,621
The thought of it right now...

626
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:16,563
To escape everything?

627
00:31:16,745 --> 00:31:18,722
- I wish I could.
- Well, you know that you can't.

628
00:31:18,845 --> 00:31:21,043
I love him, Sam.
He's all I have.

629
00:31:21,535 --> 00:31:24,283
- What's wrong with me?
- Nothing's wrong...

630
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:26,781
You can't help love. I get that.

631
00:31:26,906 --> 00:31:28,500
But if you love Bobby,

632
00:31:29,377 --> 00:31:30,972
you gotta let this go.

633
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:33,660
How do I do that?

634
00:31:40,856 --> 00:31:42,100
How's the baby?

635
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:46,083
I just... checked their chart, and...

636
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:48,410
they're both doing fine.

637
00:31:48,535 --> 00:31:50,960
It's hard watching her go
through all this pain,

638
00:31:51,097 --> 00:31:52,321
losing Phillip,

639
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:53,661
maybe the baby.

640
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:56,293
That baby means everything to her.

641
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:58,472
Well, at least she has you.

642
00:32:00,468 --> 00:32:02,710
- Is there something bothering you?
- Yes,

643
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,282
the timing of this,

644
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:07,510
Phillip dying in a way
that kept his heart pumping.

645
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:10,520
You think he killed himself for her?

646
00:32:13,456 --> 00:32:14,830
You think I killed him?

647
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:17,431
I think there's a fine line
between miracle and convenience,

648
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:21,110
and I think about this pregnancy
and how I got to know Janine

649
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:22,082
and you

650
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:23,322
and not phillip.

651
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:25,582
- He pushed me to be there.
- And you let him.

652
00:32:25,706 --> 00:32:28,481
Here was this wonderful,
sweet woman

653
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:30,783
feeling alone in her marriage.

654
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:32,810
And there's Phillip,

655
00:32:33,228 --> 00:32:35,920
not deserving what he had,
not appreciating what he had.

656
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:37,511
But he had it. He

657
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:38,933
had her.

658
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:41,503
So I wanted
something I couldn't have.

659
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:44,162
Don't tell me
you've never felt that way.

660
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:46,082
I loved my brother.

661
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:50,973
But he wasn't
good enough for her.

662
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:52,953
But if he's dead...

663
00:32:53,948 --> 00:32:55,490
At least she's alive.

664
00:33:06,556 --> 00:33:07,811
Hey, you all right?

665
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:11,442
You know, Malcolm...
might have killed his brother

666
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:13,360
for someone that he loves.

667
00:33:14,168 --> 00:33:15,013
And me?

668
00:33:15,617 --> 00:33:17,512
I can't even find her, Pete.

669
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,093
Betsey.

670
00:33:20,328 --> 00:33:21,863
All I know is St. Louis.

671
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:24,872
You know, Heather is working
for a company in St. Louis.

672
00:33:25,008 --> 00:33:28,502
But I don't know who Betsey's with
or where she's living or

673
00:33:29,385 --> 00:33:31,531
what she thinks about me.
And...

674
00:33:33,508 --> 00:33:36,180
I mean, as far as she knows,
her father's gone.

675
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:38,263
That's horrible, Dell.

676
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:42,401
But Heather was in a good place
when she left,

677
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:44,042
and she loves Betsey.

678
00:33:45,045 --> 00:33:46,390
But she's my child.

679
00:33:47,297 --> 00:33:51,193
You'll know. When... Violet's baby
is born, you'll know, and you...

680
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:55,023
I'd bet you'd do anything.

681
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:56,952
I mean, what kind of a man am I

682
00:33:57,478 --> 00:33:59,523
that I just sit here and watch?

683
00:34:03,197 --> 00:34:06,842
Just because you haven't found her yet
doesn't mean you won't.

684
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,510
What's going on?

685
00:34:22,216 --> 00:34:24,322
I want to believe it
won't be a problem,

686
00:34:24,448 --> 00:34:26,693
that I can be there for you and Ben

687
00:34:26,828 --> 00:34:27,692
and the baby.

688
00:34:27,826 --> 00:34:30,283
Yeah, the baby has to come first.
I get that.

689
00:34:30,406 --> 00:34:31,953
I can make that work.

690
00:34:32,407 --> 00:34:34,503
I need to be there
for both of them...

691
00:34:34,626 --> 00:34:35,722
For the baby

692
00:34:36,126 --> 00:34:37,371
and for Violet.

693
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:45,911
I guess it's better you know now

694
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:47,790
before anyone gets hurts.

695
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:51,643
I'd like to keep treating Ben.

696
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:53,211
I don't want this to affect him.

697
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:58,012
I don't know, Pete.

698
00:35:05,346 --> 00:35:07,441
You are testing phillip's blood?

699
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:09,720
Why? I mean, the M.E.'s doing that.

700
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:11,742
I think he did it.
Malcolm.

701
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:15,633
I think he murdered his brother,
and I need evidence. I need proof.

702
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:19,643
We just pulled off the unthinkable.

703
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:23,162
I mean, two lives were almost gone,
and then a heart dropped in our laps,

704
00:35:23,286 --> 00:35:25,283
and now they're gonna live.
It's a miracle.

705
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:27,000
You and I did it.
Can't we just

706
00:35:27,138 --> 00:35:28,330
focus on that?

707
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:29,552
I can't.

708
00:35:29,687 --> 00:35:33,033
Phillip's dead. And Malcolm
might get to be with Janine.

709
00:35:33,155 --> 00:35:34,492
Why's he got to be a bad guy?

710
00:35:34,546 --> 00:35:37,023
I mean, maybe he's just a guy who
didn't get along with his brother.

711
00:35:37,055 --> 00:35:38,420
You told me he was a good guy.

712
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:41,512
Good people don't murder their brothers
and then get to sleep with their wives.

713
00:35:41,638 --> 00:35:43,361
Can't they just be
two people in love?

714
00:35:43,485 --> 00:35:45,760
- I mean, why try and tear 'em apart?
- Okay, Noah,

715
00:35:45,897 --> 00:35:49,153
there are lines and rules
and things that you can't do.

716
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:51,652
They shouldn't be together.
It's wrong.

717
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:53,532
Autopsy results came back.

718
00:35:53,655 --> 00:35:56,451
M.E. ruled it an accidental
insulin overdose.

719
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,283
Guess it all worked out.

720
00:36:07,057 --> 00:36:10,153
- I still think he did it.
- There isn't any proof.

721
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:12,632
You kissed me back.

722
00:36:16,137 --> 00:36:17,371
You're angry at me.

723
00:36:17,495 --> 00:36:19,290
You say that I'm at fault.

724
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:23,273
But it isn't just that I kissed you.
It's that you kissed me back.

725
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,513
That's why you're angry.

726
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:40,992
Thank you for letting me talk to him.

727
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:49,763
What's going on?

728
00:36:50,486 --> 00:36:51,971
Bobby, honey, listen to me...

729
00:36:52,098 --> 00:36:53,233
as soon as they leave.

730
00:36:53,356 --> 00:36:55,460
- They can't, Bobby.
- Don't let them tell you that.

731
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,053
Don't let them make you feel
this is wrong.

732
00:36:58,465 --> 00:36:59,913
I'm twice your age.

733
00:37:00,295 --> 00:37:02,740
Age doesn't matter, Donna.
I love you.

734
00:37:02,966 --> 00:37:03,960
You're 17.

735
00:37:04,675 --> 00:37:06,863
And I was in a really bad place,

736
00:37:07,546 --> 00:37:08,781
and I needed you, but...

737
00:37:09,976 --> 00:37:11,322
I don't love you.

738
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:14,952
You're lying.

739
00:37:15,078 --> 00:37:16,381
They're making you say this.

740
00:37:16,507 --> 00:37:19,021
Bobby, you have your whole life
ahead of you.

741
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:21,531
And no one is saying that
this isn't real, what you feel...

742
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:22,813
we both feel.

743
00:37:23,595 --> 00:37:24,692
You know it.

744
00:37:26,015 --> 00:37:26,862
I'm sorry.

745
00:37:35,456 --> 00:37:37,230
Bobby, I know that you love her.

746
00:37:37,366 --> 00:37:40,713
But sometimes the best thing to do
when you love someone

747
00:37:40,957 --> 00:37:42,352
and it's not right

748
00:37:43,198 --> 00:37:44,542
is to just let go

749
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:46,052
and move on.

750
00:38:00,956 --> 00:38:02,882
I had no idea you were in town.

751
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:04,560
Just a bit of business.
I wanted to

752
00:38:04,686 --> 00:38:07,383
check in and see
how my practice was doing.

753
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,082
There were some bumps, but

754
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:12,791
I'm feeling good about
where things are heading.

755
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,810
Patient bookings are strong.

756
00:38:15,346 --> 00:38:17,491
Good, good.
I'm glad to hear it.

757
00:38:20,437 --> 00:38:21,381
That's...

758
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:23,152
all you wanted?

759
00:38:23,288 --> 00:38:25,043
I'll be back in a couple of weeks.
You can

760
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:27,710
bring me up to speed
on everything then.

761
00:38:38,456 --> 00:38:39,701
You were right.

762
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:41,532
I wasn't being honest,

763
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:42,450
and...

764
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:45,631
I think maybe I should be.

765
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,323
You know what I think?

766
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:52,702
I think that... what we're doing...

767
00:38:53,296 --> 00:38:54,393
is too hard.

768
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,121
We're divorced,

769
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:59,512
but I still care about you.

770
00:38:59,635 --> 00:39:00,792
And hearing out

771
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:04,411
everybody you're dating
and what you're doing, it's just...

772
00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:06,151
It's not good,

773
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,421
for either of us.

774
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:09,900
You said you could handle it.
I mean, I thought we were friends.

775
00:39:10,035 --> 00:39:12,242
I know, I did, and we are, but I...

776
00:39:13,956 --> 00:39:16,951
When your dating pool
is everybody that I know...

777
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:18,672
Archer, Bryce,

778
00:39:18,988 --> 00:39:19,772
Duncan...

779
00:39:20,118 --> 00:39:21,660
there's a limit, Nai.

780
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:24,093
And maybe I said I could handle it,
but I can't

781
00:39:24,217 --> 00:39:25,793
and... I shouldn't have to.

782
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:31,822
- So what are you saying?
- We can't be friends anymore.

783
00:39:33,045 --> 00:39:34,593
I need some distance,

784
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:36,663
to let go, to...
to move on.

785
00:39:39,815 --> 00:39:41,101
You want distance.

786
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:42,222
I need it.

787
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:46,352
Don't you?

788
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:36,040
Sheldon. What happened?

789
00:40:36,177 --> 00:40:38,150
Anita thought I was gonna confess
my love.

790
00:40:38,286 --> 00:40:40,833
When I insisted her feelings
were misplaced, she...

791
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:42,593
she beat me with the roses.
It was great.

792
00:40:42,718 --> 00:40:45,043
- It was great?
- I forced her, I pushed her,

793
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:46,692
to a breakthrough, Violet.

794
00:40:46,817 --> 00:40:49,293
And... when she saw what she
did to me, she broke down.

795
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:52,491
She realized she spent so much money
on gifts for the wrong person.

796
00:40:52,945 --> 00:40:55,353
She called her coworker
from the office, and th...

797
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:56,782
they're having dinner.

798
00:40:57,516 --> 00:40:59,711
You should feel so proud, Sheldon.

799
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:02,162
You know, you...
gotta put something on that.

800
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:04,191
But that's not the best part.
The best part is I

801
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:05,820
had a breakthrough of my own.

802
00:41:05,868 --> 00:41:07,682
And I realized that
when someone has feelings

803
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:09,673
and doesn't let the other person know,
that's a...

804
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,000
that's a missed opportunity.

805
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:12,710
But isn't that what I said before?

806
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,691
Yes, and I convinced Anita,
but then

807
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:16,052
I realized that it...

808
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:17,533
it applied to me.

809
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:20,193
I'm in love with you, Violet,

810
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:23,253
from the first time we rode
on that elevator.

811
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:25,891
I don't care
whose child you're carrying.

812
00:41:26,815 --> 00:41:28,260
I can talk to you about anything.

813
00:41:28,397 --> 00:41:30,041
I want to talk to you
about everything.

814
00:41:30,178 --> 00:41:32,223
And... when I'm not with you...

815
00:41:33,025 --> 00:41:34,022
I'm empty.

816
00:41:37,188 --> 00:41:38,582
Will you marry me?

817
00:41:40,995 --> 00:41:42,993
