1
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:08,644
He is not talking to me.

2
00:00:09,315 --> 00:00:10,752
I am not not talking.

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,537
He is barely talking.

4
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:14,764
I was married,

5
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:15,781
a long time ago.

6
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:18,823
I told him but he seems to think I
didn't tell him soon enough.

7
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:23,196
Well, that's... none of my business.

8
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,009
Hello.

9
00:00:32,077 --> 00:00:33,444
Hello.

10
00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:34,912
Hello.

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:36,989
Oh, I thought we were saying hello.

12
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:37,776
We're not.

13
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:40,098
Kitten.

14
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:43,093
My name is Addison.

15
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:45,439
I thought we could have a drink.
It's 9:00 a.m.

16
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,844
Well, I thought we could talk.
Are you dying?

17
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:51,019
What?
Do you have cancer,
renal failure, a brain tumor?

18
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:52,880
Are you you dying?
I came to see you.

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,017
Well, here I am. You saw me.

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,296
So now you're leaving?

21
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:01,970
You are.

22
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:08,875
I'm at the Carlyle.

23
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:15,481
Come on, Dr. Wilder.

24
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:18,116
It's not as bad as it looks.
The cancer has spread

25
00:01:18,116 --> 00:01:19,778
From your abdomen
to your liver to your lungs,

26
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:21,108
and you've kept your optimism.

27
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:22,024
My colon's good...

28
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:24,497
like a teenage vegetarian.

29
00:01:24,664 --> 00:01:25,570
Neil?

30
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:29,853
All my tests are perfect.

31
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:31,577
The baby looks good.

32
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:34,133
And Dr. Montgomery assures me it's a girl.

33
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:36,864
So you better revise your list of names.

34
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,914
There's nothing wrong
with a girl named Doug.

35
00:01:39,677 --> 00:01:41,327
Besides, doctors are wrong all the time.

36
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:48,474
All right, Pete, you know what
the blood has to tell you.

37
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:49,607
I need six weeks.

38
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:53,404
I need to be there.
I need to hold our little girl.

39
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,410
Well, it's like I said, mind over matter.

40
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,965
Your attitude is great. There's
nothing more I could ask for.

41
00:01:57,965 --> 00:01:59,011
Well, I'm asking.

42
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:02,128
I'm asking for more.
I know you can't save him,

43
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:04,435
but... I need you to tell me.

44
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:06,390
He's gonna be alive when she's born.

45
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,658
I need my little girl to have a father.

46
00:02:16,582 --> 00:02:17,688
She has taken a lover.

47
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:18,771
A lovah.

48
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,305
And he's old? Good-lookin' old.

49
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:22,545
But from the way she looked at him,

50
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:23,887
I'd say he's not her lover anymore.

51
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:26,723
She never said anything about a guy.

52
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:34,320
I am not talking about it.

53
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:36,712
So, uh, everybody have a good weekend?

54
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,565
Well, I did... good weekend.
It was very eventful.

55
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:41,718
Got married.

56
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:45,353
Uh, I know what you're gonna say.

57
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:46,773
Uh, it's... it's fast and... and crazy... 

58
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:47,470
Whoa. Where'd you meet her?

59
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,860
I... I didn't. Uh... I married Heather.

60
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,108
I know what you want to say,
but I know what I'm doing,

61
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,034
and... and she's cleaned up,

62
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:56,749
and... and Betsey's really happy, really happy.

63
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:59,865
So it's great. I had a...
I had a great weekend.

64
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:06,972
Where is my son?

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,581
Evan Dawson. I'm his mother, Lynn Jarvey.

66
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,084
I'm sorry. I don't... 

67
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:12,715
My son was kidnapped. You saw him.

68
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:14,586
You treated him here, and I
think you know where he is.

69
00:03:20,712 --> 00:03:22,131
Uh, yes, I did treat him...

70
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:23,094
A while ago,

71
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:24,365
and I don't... 

72
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:26,625
It wasn't Evan, though.
Is it maybe Porter?

73
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,553
He may have told you that,
but that is my son.

74
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:30,748
His father kidnapped him,
and I want him back.

75
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:33,060
Wow. Um, I'm sorry.

76
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,655
I hired a private investigator

77
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:36,372
who says you traced his insulin pump.

78
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:38,192
You called his pediatrician.

79
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:42,254
You knew he was kidnapped
before he was hospitalized.

80
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:42,929
Mrs. Jarvey, let me assure you,

81
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:45,193
I treated your son, and then he left.

82
00:03:45,193 --> 00:03:46,725
I don't know anything about a call.

83
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:48,302
I don't believe you.

84
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:51,876
You didn't believe your son either.

85
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:54,912
From what I remember, this boy told me

86
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,999
he was being abused by his stepfather.

87
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:58,292
I'm assuming that's your husband.

88
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,072
You may think that you're helping my son,

89
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,576
but you don't know me or my husband,

90
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,085
and I'm telling you, this did not happen.

91
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:06,875
I am his mother. I would know.

92
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:10,909
Evan is a 13-year-old boy
with severe diabetes

93
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:12,174
who got an infection

94
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:14,073
because he was living in his father's car.

95
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:16,448
Who knows how they're living now?

96
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,108
Please, Dr. Freedman,
if you know something...

97
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:22,384
I don't want my son to die.

98
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:24,597
I wish I could help. I'm sorry.

99
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:36,843
Damn it.

100
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:39,757
Problem?

101
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:41,292
My patient is dying.

102
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:44,228
His wife is due in six weeks,
and he's running out of time.

103
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:47,097
Intra-abdominal sarcoma
with liver and lung mets.

104
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:48,450
Well...

105
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:50,540
He has a few weeks at best.

106
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,191
What I thought.

107
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,954
Unless you want to try something new.

108
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:55,769
What, prayer?
No.

109
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,246
Better. Me.

110
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,578
Okay, sacrilegious, maybe.

111
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:01,347
But I've been working on
some new procedures

112
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:02,371
to inhibit tumor growth.

113
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:04,819
Maybe give your patient
enough time to meet his baby.

114
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:05,722
Neil Delhom?

115
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,145
It's that bad? I just saw him
and Margaret in the lobby.

116
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:09,129
It's that bad.

117
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:10,498
But I want to make it better.

118
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:13,478
I have read your protocols
on tumornhibitors.

119
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:15,216
They're not without side effects.

120
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:17,368
What kind of side effects
are we talking about?

121
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:18,321
They run the gamut,

122
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:20,668
but bottom line is, your patient's dying.

123
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:23,068
I can give him a better
quality of life than death.

124
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:27,479
Going somewhere?

125
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:29,535
Out.

126
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:31,873
You may not want to talk to me,

127
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,854
but I remember Evan Dawson from a year ago

128
00:05:34,423 --> 00:05:35,752
when I covered for you.
And?

129
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,898
And if you know where they are, turn them in.

130
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:41,214
I don't and I handled it. I gotta go.

131
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,917
Basically, I put a radio transmitter

132
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:46,900
into your liver

133
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,955
and use a probe to heat up the tumor

134
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:51,496
and blast the cancer cells.
Margaret.

135
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,191
I know this is a lot to digest.

136
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,785
We spent two years
trying to have this baby... 

137
00:06:01,104 --> 00:06:04,579
Hormones and needles
and doctors telling us,

138
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:05,504
"that's all I can do."

139
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:08,187
now we're having the baby...

140
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,861
It's just not fair...

141
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:17,055
What's happening to Neil.

142
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:22,227
This... this c... this can help?

143
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:24,048
All our preliminary studies are excellent.

144
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:27,610
And you're recommending this?

145
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:30,255
I'm...

146
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,522
I'm concerned.

147
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:35,117
I... I want to throw everything
that we can at this,

148
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:39,792
but I also want whatever time
that you have to be... livable

149
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:40,938
for both of you.

150
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:48,243
Well, you asked for more time,

151
00:06:48,243 --> 00:06:50,137
for your daughter to have a father.

152
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,569
Dr. Fife...

153
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:57,661
He's your only shot. I say take it.

154
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:04,314
It's cool. We're studying robotics.

155
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:06,043
Wow. That's big-time.

156
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:08,619
Uh, the pump looks good. It's clean.

157
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,274
You do have a slight fever,
though, so I'm just gonna... 

158
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:12,054
I'm gonna take a little blood.
It might be an infection.

159
00:07:12,054 --> 00:07:13,450
How you feeling otherwise?

160
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,052
A little tired, but mostly good.

161
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:19,052
You can have a taco on me.
You want me to get lost?

162
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:19,866
Kinda, yeah.

163
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,429
You just... just give us a minute, bud.

164
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:30,002
So, um, this isn't just a house call.

165
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,081
No.

166
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:34,225
Uh, Lynn came to see me.

167
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,108
Does she know we're here?
Does she know we're in L.A.?

168
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:37,860
I don't think so,

169
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,422
but she hired a private investigator.

170
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:40,474
She thinks I know something.

171
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:42,030
We have to leave. We have to Leave L.A.

172
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,874
I didn't say anything to her, and I won't.

173
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:45,185
You don't have to run
on my account.

174
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,399
We're settled, you know?
We're making a life.

175
00:07:52,654 --> 00:07:54,532
Is she still with Ted?
Yes.

176
00:07:54,532 --> 00:08:00,573
How can a womaoose
a man over her own son?

177
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:05,028
I don't... I...

178
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:06,171
So just be careful, Frank.

179
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:09,292
I'll let you know if anything
comes back on these labs.

180
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:14,212
A marriage intervention?

181
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:16,638
That's why we're here?
Is there even such a thing?

182
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:18,264
It's codependence, Pete.

183
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,317
Dell is facilitating her addiction

184
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,550
by taking her back
every time she gets clean.

185
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,095
And there's a child at stake.

186
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:27,295
I still can't believe it.
I mean, Dell is married.

187
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:30,683
Is he happy?
I... I think he's in denial.

188
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,377
He married the mother of his child.

189
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:33,667
Couldn't that be a good thing?

190
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:37,466
Okay, I have a patient
who actually needs some help.

191
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:40,464
Pete, will you...

192
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:41,723
Keep an eye on Dr. Fife?

193
00:08:41,723 --> 00:08:43,982
He worries me.
He worries me, too,

194
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,525
but I don't see any other options.

195
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:49,966
So are you in?

196
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:56,356
Oh, there he is. Hey, hey.
Where were you?
Hi.

197
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:58,290
What? Uh, nowhere. I was just,
you know, doing a thing.

198
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:58,919
You ready to talk to Dell?

199
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,466
Oh, yeah, sure.
No time like the present.

200
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,139
Don't tell me you're getting involved.

201
00:09:02,768 --> 00:09:03,382
It's Dell.

202
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:09,937
So I hear congratulations are in order.

203
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:13,500
Thanks.

204
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:16,085
Something you wanted?

205
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,082
Can we talk to you for a minute?

206
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:19,872
Cooper Freedman?

207
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,769
Uh, yeah, hi. I'm Dr. Freedman.

208
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:24,979
We have a warrant for your arrest.

209
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:26,792
Please put your hands
behind your back, sir.

210
00:09:27,122 --> 00:09:28,993
No, no, no. There... there
must be a mistake, officer.

211
00:09:28,993 --> 00:09:29,779
What's going on?

212
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,054
You have the right to remain silent.

213
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:33,099
Anything you say can and will
be used against you...

214
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:34,372
I'm okay. I'm okay.

215
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,064
I'll call the lawyer. I'll be right there.

216
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:37,775
If you cannot afford a lawyer,

217
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:40,476
one will be appointed to
represent you before any...

218
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,693
This is a printout of all the calls

219
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:47,299
to Lynn Jarvey's cell phone
in the past two hours.

220
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:51,311
The last one came from
a pay phone here in L.A.

221
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:53,270
from her son Evan.

222
00:09:53,305 --> 00:09:55,740
He asked his mom
to stop looking for him

223
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,905
so you and his dad
wouldn't get into trouble.

224
00:09:57,905 --> 00:10:00,559
You've given material assistance

225
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,895
to aid and abet a kidnapper.

226
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:05,372
Carries a sentence in California
of 5 to 11 years.

227
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:08,511
I'm not entirely sure what
it does to your medical license,

228
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,918
but I'm thinking it can't be good.

229
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:13,240
I don't want you.

230
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,058
Tell me where her son is, I let you go.

231
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:22,748
I think I'm gonna wait for my lawyer.

232
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:35,753
There's really evidence
in a box of tongue depressors?

233
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,392
All right, so give me a call.

234
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:43,509
What do they want?

235
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,957
They think that Cooper
knows where this kid is,

236
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:47,784
that he's been in contact with him.

237
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:49,777
This is ridiculous. It's been a year.

238
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:51,940
Yes, but it's Cooper.

239
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:54,632
Do you really think they're wrong?

240
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:56,474
I don't know.

241
00:10:56,474 --> 00:10:59,935
Uh, Cooper did know that
the boy was kidnapped

242
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:01,612
when he was here last year.

243
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:05,111
He traced the boy's insulin pump.
And you knew about this?

244
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:06,883
Well, it was his patient, so it's his call.

245
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:08,162
Doesn't mean he knows
where they are now.

246
00:11:08,162 --> 00:11:10,167
Well, look, Charlotte is
with the lawyers right now.

247
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,137
They're gonna work something out.

248
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:14,624
Cooper gave medical service
to a patient who needed it.

249
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:16,004
That's what he's supposed to do.

250
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:18,288
What jury is gonna convict him for that?

251
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:27,796
It's almost in place.

252
00:11:27,864 --> 00:11:30,032
Grab that. Steady it.

253
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,907
You and Dr. Bennett are from

254
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:36,389
the warm-and-fuzzy school of medicine.

255
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:37,863
I'm from the get-things-done school.

256
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,415
No reason you can't do both.

257
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,541
Is that why you took my side over Naomi's?

258
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,070
Move to the left.

259
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:45,428
My left.

260
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:48,015
Actually, I was...

261
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:51,372
concerned about what was best for my patient.
And Naomi isn't.

262
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:53,335
I'm not putting words in your mouth.

263
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:54,474
Just following the logic.

264
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:56,320
Dr. Bennett cares about her patients,

265
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,396
but she sometimes cares more
about getting her way,

266
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:01,498
at least when it comes to me.
I hadn't noticed.

267
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:02,352
Yes, you did.

268
00:12:02,352 --> 00:12:07,848
Now sit back and watch science in action.

269
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:10,631
it's gonna be fine.

270
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,010
Just bail me out, and my lawyer

271
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,754
is gonna figure out a way
to get me outta this.
They won't set bail

272
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:16,475
until after the grand jury
hearing tomorrow.

273
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,119
I'm sorry.

274
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:24,906
I'm not worried about me being in jail.

275
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,749
It's Evan. He might have
a kidney infection.

276
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,167
You saw him and you lied?
Lower your voice.

277
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,402
Oh, it's okay when you lie?
You lying about your marriage

278
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:35,917
and me helping a patient,
it's completely different.

279
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:39,124
You're in jail, Cooper. Give this kid up.

280
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:41,837
I can't send Evan back to
his stepfather to get abused.

281
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:44,630
If he's sick, he's gonna need antibiotics

282
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,165
before he winds up
needing to be hospitalized.

283
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:47,734
No

284
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:49,505
I need you to pick up his labs... 

285
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:51,838
I am not committing a felony
to protect your patient.

286
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,034
I need you to pick up his labs,

287
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:54,569
and I will get him whatever he needs

288
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:55,762
as soon as I get bailed out.

289
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:58,320
You owe me this.

290
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:04,174
Hi. You want to
close the door and sit down?

291
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,746
An intervention? We're really doing this?

292
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:10,208
Well, we were both there
when Heather took Betsey.

293
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:15,169
And we were there when
she came back on drugs.

294
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,659
We saw what that did to you.

295
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:19,301
So... so this, um, this "marriage,"

296
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:21,124
this is part of your pattern with Heather.

297
00:13:21,124 --> 00:13:24,783
She... she gets you to trust her,
and then her addiction kicks in,

298
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:25,600
and then you get hurt.

299
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:28,543
And I... I know how difficult it's been

300
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:31,714
for you to balance working
and being a single father... 
Oh, oh, yeah.

301
00:13:31,714 --> 00:13:33,180
Sometimes, when we get overwhelmed,

302
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,426
we look for the easy answer.
Yeah.

303
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:39,225
Trust me. It hasn't been easy,
okay? We've been wking on it.
Yeah, well, you kept it secret.

304
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:41,686
Yeah, 'cause I knew you wouldn't approve.
Okay.

305
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:44,256
Look, s... sometimes it's hard to
hear advice from other people.

306
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,280
Yeah, yeah.
It... it's scary. But... but you
at least need to listen.

307
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,662
Y... you think I should take relationship advice

308
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,943
from you, Violet, really,
about what's best for my child,

309
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:55,732
about whether or not I should
be with someone that I love?

310
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:58,746
Dell-... 
I'm... I'm not sleeping
with my colleague's brother.

311
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:01,574
I'm not getting divorced
and... and leaving my job.

312
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,775
I married my daughter's mother.

313
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,268
Now... I appreciate that you care,

314
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:08,765
but I need to get home to my wife.

315
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:17,024
That went well.
Yeah. Yeah, that was... that was good.

316
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,156
Thank you.

317
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,308
You're late.

318
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,726
You look good.

319
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:48,380
The California air has done you well.

320
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,958
Martini, dry, no olive, for the lady.

321
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,835
And for the gentleman,
vodka tonic, lime, no ice.

322
00:14:56,835 --> 00:14:57,901
Thank you.

323
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:00,692
You remembered.

324
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,832
I've been mixing your drinks
since I was 8 years old.

325
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:03,819
It's not something
you forget.

326
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:10,582
That's coarse.

327
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:14,193
A lady never downs a drink
in the company of a gentleman.

328
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:16,406
Well... you're not a gentleman.

329
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:19,774
You're my father.
So... what's her name?

330
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:22,290
Who?
Your mistress. I mean,

331
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,400
I'm assuming you have a mistress in L.A.

332
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,324
Why else would you be here?
Addie.

333
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:26,850
I mean, you didn't come
when Archer was dying.

334
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,531
That wasn't important enough
for you. So I'm thinking,

335
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:31,434
there must be a prime piece
of ass here on the west coast

336
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:34,156
to get the captain to fire up
the old jet and come on out.

337
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:40,519
Well, uh... I see you have changed.

338
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,659
The Addison I know didn't use that language.

339
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,399
Well, the California air has done me well.

340
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,766
I'm a whole new girl.
Does bizzy know you're here?

341
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:53,477
There was a point when you
liked spending time with me.

342
00:15:53,477 --> 00:15:55,068
I told you the last time,
I'm done. I was finished.

343
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:56,380
And then you have the nerve to come back... 

344
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,651
That was just an argument.

345
00:15:57,651 --> 00:15:59,055
No, that was me getting away from you.

346
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:01,033
I can't imagine why
you're behaving like this.

347
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:02,368
Oh, you can't imagine, huh?
So let's see.

348
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:03,850
Was it the tennis instructor with the legs,

349
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,972
the blonde from your office, four of my nannies,

350
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:09,252
three maids, oh, Jolie, my french tutor,

351
00:16:09,252 --> 00:16:10,802
Louise, the chef?

352
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:13,309
There were so many,
I can't remember. Can you?

353
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,524
You don't talk to me that way.
I'm your father.

354
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:17,069
Oh, I do talk to you that way. I do.

355
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:20,025
After 39 years and a very
intense year of therapy

356
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:22,863
after my husband left me
for doing exactly what you do,

357
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:24,287
I do talk to you that way.

358
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:26,280
Now does bizzy know that you're here?

359
00:16:27,762 --> 00:16:29,150
Your mother thinks I'm in France.

360
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:36,164
And once again, I'm supposed
to lie to her for you.

361
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:39,487
Addison, I came here to see you, to...

362
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:44,446
We're family.

363
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:46,882
We're done.

364
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:58,890
She got a lot of nerve, bringing him in here.

365
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,426
It's ironic... he doesn't have to hide.

366
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:04,028
I wonder how much he's gonna set bail for.

367
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:06,965
Whatever it is, we'll pay it.

368
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:13,894
Cooper...

369
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:15,251
I'm okay.

370
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,250
All rise.

371
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:20,945
All present in the state of
California vs. Cooper Freedman.

372
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:23,893
Be seated.
Dr. Freedman, you were present

373
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:25,765
at a grand jury hearing this morning

374
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:27,680
where yore asked questions
as to the whereabouts

375
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,192
of Evan Dawson, but
you refused to answer.

376
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:32,989
Is that correct?
Yes, Your Honor.

377
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:35,089
At the urging of the district attorney,

378
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:37,305
I am prepared to grant
immunity from prosecution

379
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:39,620
if you provide the grand jury with the location

380
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,134
of Evan Dawson and his father.

381
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:44,188
With that said, if I send you
back to the grand jury,

382
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,676
will you answer all questions put before you?

383
00:17:50,432 --> 00:17:52,579
I'm sorry, your honor, but I can't do that.

384
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:54,374
Where is he?!
I need my son!

385
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:57,827
Dr. Freedman, the court holds you in contempt.

386
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,863
I am remanding you to the custody of

387
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:02,599
The los angeles county
sheriff's office until such time

388
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:05,587
as you agree to come forth
and answer to the grand jury.

389
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:07,955
Motion for bail, Your Honor.
Denied. No bail.

390
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:09,112
He sits until he talks.

391
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:21,258
Charlotte.

392
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,941
Get out.

393
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:24,424
Are you okay?

394
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:31,233
they beat him up.

395
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:34,012
Who does that?

396
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,066
Who hits someone and...

397
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:39,621
He takes care of children, for god sake.

398
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:40,862
You're upset.

399
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:41,787
I'm angry.

400
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,709
I mean, I know he'd do
anything for his patients.

401
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:48,867
He'll cover up whatever it takes
to keep them safe, but...

402
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:52,003
This is wrong, and...

403
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:56,341
And what?

404
00:18:57,877 --> 00:18:58,285
Nothing.

405
00:18:58,812 --> 00:19:00,498
Oh, come on, Charlotte.

406
00:19:00,498 --> 00:19:03,327
I'd think you'd be a better liar than that.

407
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:05,650
I usually am.

408
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,617
I'm upset, okay?

409
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:10,092
I mean, I'm a damn fine liar, but...

410
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,076
He wants me to do something.

411
00:19:16,462 --> 00:19:18,009
And I shouldn't.

412
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,312
But he wants me to.

413
00:19:20,312 --> 00:19:22,615
He knows where they are, doesn't he?

414
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:25,837
It's against the law, Charlotte.

415
00:19:25,905 --> 00:19:27,600
He can't do that. You can't do that.

416
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,195
Evan has a kidney infection.
He needs antibiotics.

417
00:19:30,195 --> 00:19:33,778
Charlotte, you can't do anything.

418
00:19:33,846 --> 00:19:36,180
I know.

419
00:19:36,248 --> 00:19:38,049
I mean, why should I?

420
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:41,085
He lied to me. He lied to all of us.

421
00:19:41,153 --> 00:19:44,355
So why should I help?

422
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:46,001
Look at the blisters.

423
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,272
He woke up screaming.

424
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,187
They gave him morphine for the pain.

425
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,381
It's not so bad.

426
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:55,487
It is. It's horrible. What's wrong with him?

427
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,275
It's called hand-foot syndrome.

428
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:58,945
It's one of the side effects we talked about.

429
00:20:00,092 --> 00:20:01,059
I want it stopped.

430
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:03,207
I... I can't put him through this.

431
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:05,680
No. I... I... I want to be there.

432
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,498
I want the chance to be there.

433
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:09,772
I don't care what the side effects are.

434
00:20:09,782 --> 00:20:10,281
Neil.

435
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:11,453
You heard me, Pete.

436
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:13,497
We keep going.

437
00:20:13,497 --> 00:20:22,126
Neil's going into liver failure.

438
00:20:24,063 --> 00:20:25,826
He's dying, but he was always dying.

439
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:28,922
The man is in excruciating pain
because of your treatment.

440
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:29,787
That's all you can say?

441
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:31,611
We should probably take him
off the protocol.

442
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:33,603
What is wrong with you?

443
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:35,172
The results we get from his treatment

444
00:20:35,172 --> 00:20:36,677
will help refine the protocol for the future.

445
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:38,938
I... I... I can't believe you can just sit there

446
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,348
and... and pretend that this is a good thing.

447
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,368
I have a patient

448
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:43,846
who is holding out hope,
hope that we gave him,

449
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:45,986
and now I have to go
back out there and tell him

450
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:46,616
he'll never see his child.

451
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:50,898
Well, if that's the problem, I'll tell him.

452
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:54,032
What? Isn't that what you want?

453
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:56,598
No. That's not what I want at all.

454
00:21:02,397 --> 00:21:05,660
Hey. You want to tell me what you're doing?

455
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,472
Uh, um...

456
00:21:08,992 --> 00:21:09,872
What are you doing, Addison?

457
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:12,482
I'm getting Cooper out of jail.
He knows where Evan is.

458
00:21:12,482 --> 00:21:14,284
He asked Charlotte to go
to them, and now she left.

459
00:21:14,284 --> 00:21:16,274
So you're going through Charlotte's stuff

460
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:17,536
to see where she went?

461
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:19,597
What are you... you're not some...

462
00:21:19,597 --> 00:21:23,028
This isn't your job to begin with.
Yeah, well, Cooper's a doctor.

463
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:25,290
It's not his job to harbor fugitives and lie

464
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,175
and put someone else in the middle of all this.

465
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:29,749
You know, cover-ups don't work. They fall apart.

466
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:31,896
They cau collateral damage.???????????????????????
People get hurt.

467
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:34,533
You been all worked up
since this guy showed up,

468
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:36,371
and whoever he is... it's the captain.

469
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:40,607
Oh. I always liked your father.

470
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:42,848
Yeah, well... you don't really know him.

471
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:44,237
Got it.

472
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:46,331
Wait. Addison, just...

473
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:49,280
talk to Cooper, talk to Charlotte.

474
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:51,682
Don't go around them.
The police don't want them, Sam.

475
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,818
They want Evan and his father.

476
00:21:53,886 --> 00:21:55,720
Look, I get why Cooper can't talk now.

477
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:56,439
He'll hate himself forever.

478
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:58,866
Charlotte's the loyal
girlfriend, so she can't do it.

479
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:02,098
I'll do it. Cooper can be
the hero. I'll be the bad guy.

480
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:07,298
All right.

481
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:11,369
It isn't anything you did.

482
00:22:11,437 --> 00:22:13,671
Infections are more common in diabetics.

483
00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:15,673
Look, we sure appreciate it.

484
00:22:15,741 --> 00:22:19,143
I know it's... it's way beyond the call of duty.

485
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:20,645
Is Dr. Cooper okay?

486
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:23,648
He's okay.

487
00:22:23,715 --> 00:22:26,484
You need to take the
antibiotics three times a day.

488
00:22:26,552 --> 00:22:29,854
It's very important to take all of it, all right?

489
00:22:41,633 --> 00:22:44,135
Dad?

490
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:51,269
How'd you get me out?

491
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:54,705
They found Frank and Evan. I was with 'em.

492
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:57,433
Cooper, I'm sorry.
What, did... did they follow you?

493
00:22:57,433 --> 00:22:58,544
No. I was careful.

494
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,290
Cooper.

495
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:02,420
If you touch him, I swear to god... 

496
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,403
Stay away from us.

497
00:23:08,673 --> 00:23:09,269
Charlotte...

498
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:12,071
Did you tell anyone? Did...

499
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:13,545
Addison.

500
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,647
The necrosis is so severe,
it caused a blockage

501
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:19,053
of your bile duct in your liver... 

502
00:23:19,053 --> 00:23:21,112
what he's trying to say is...

503
00:23:22,024 --> 00:23:24,468
Unfortunately, the treatment isn't working.

504
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:26,966
we have to stop.
No.

505
00:23:26,966 --> 00:23:29,369
There's just nothing more we can do.

506
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:30,487
I'm sorry.

507
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:37,694
We made a choice.

508
00:23:39,415 --> 00:23:41,006
We can't be angry at you.

509
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:44,037
I am. I am pissed.

510
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:46,944
I want to break things I'm so pissed.

511
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:53,106
I accepted the cancer.

512
00:23:53,874 --> 00:23:55,122
I even accepted the death.

513
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:57,528
But...

514
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:03,126
at least we should've had time...

515
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:05,662
time to be a family,

516
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,766
even if for just a little bit.

517
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:13,403
there is one more option.

518
00:24:13,471 --> 00:24:15,171
Not for you.

519
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,806
For you.

520
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:20,377
We could deliver the baby... now.

521
00:24:29,587 --> 00:24:30,993
Oh, hey, Heather.

522
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:32,106
Hi.

523
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:35,477
Uh, Dell is picking up Betsey from school,

524
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:36,762
and I have a meeting.

525
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:41,598
Oh, good. Good. A meeting, that's good.

526
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:45,769
Is this part two of the intervention,

527
00:24:45,836 --> 00:24:47,404
coming to see me?

528
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:49,306
So Dell told you about that.

529
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:50,774
Yeah, he told me.

530
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:53,209
He didn't want to, but, um, no secrets.

531
00:24:53,277 --> 00:24:56,580
It's part of the program.
I can't live that way.

532
00:24:56,647 --> 00:24:58,448
That's good.

533
00:24:58,516 --> 00:25:01,217
Look... I understand.

534
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:04,988
I'm the first one to tell you, this is scary.

535
00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:07,857
I mean, we were both
worried that it was too soon.

536
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,093
I know I have to earn his trust.

537
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:12,429
But I love him,

538
00:25:12,496 --> 00:25:13,930
and he loves me,

539
00:25:13,998 --> 00:25:16,199
and Betsey is happy.

540
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:19,736
And that's the most important thing, isn't it?

541
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:23,306
Well, um, I'm... I'm not sure it is.

542
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:26,109
I mean, she's a child whose
family was broken apart.

543
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:28,678
So of course she's happy
to see you together again.

544
00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:31,147
But you don't think I'm safe.

545
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:34,084
I... I'm... I'm worried about all of you.

546
00:25:34,151 --> 00:25:35,585
I'm afraid, too.

547
00:25:35,653 --> 00:25:38,888
Not a day goes by that I
don't think about using.

548
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:42,425
But when I was in rehab,
I thought a lot about...

549
00:25:42,493 --> 00:25:44,961
when Betsey was born.

550
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:49,366
And I was clean, I was happy,
and we were a family.

551
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:51,434
When I'm with her
and when I'm with Dell,

552
00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:53,169
I'm at my best.

553
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,138
I think I can do this.

554
00:25:55,206 --> 00:25:57,907
I... I want to do this...

555
00:25:57,975 --> 00:26:00,176
because they're the best part of me.

556
00:26:04,248 --> 00:26:06,116
Look, I have to get to the meeting, so...

557
00:26:06,183 --> 00:26:08,418
Oh, of course, of course. I'm, uh...

558
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:10,887
I'm sorry to have bothered you, Heather.

559
00:26:10,955 --> 00:26:13,123
All right, bye.

560
00:26:17,128 --> 00:26:19,195
Did you not understand
what was happening?

561
00:26:19,263 --> 00:26:22,132
Did you not understand
that I had made a choice?

562
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,900
I understood

563
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:25,524
that you chose to break several laws,

564
00:26:25,524 --> 00:26:27,091
putting yourself, your girlfriend

565
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:29,213
and this entire practice at risk.

566
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,483
I confided in you, Addison.

567
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:33,588
I didn't ask for your help.
No. You were having
moral qualms,

568
00:26:33,588 --> 00:26:35,715
and I saw you coming down
on the wrong side of them.

569
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:38,393
You gave Evan to his abusive stepfather.

570
00:26:38,393 --> 00:26:40,907
He was terrified. You put him
into the hands of his attacker.

571
00:26:40,907 --> 00:26:43,128
I have to trust that the courts will sort it out.

572
00:26:43,128 --> 00:26:45,313
It's not mine to do or yours, either of yours.

573
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:46,918
Oh, you are not that naive.

574
00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:48,826
They're not gonna get it,
the father goes to jail,

575
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:51,301
and this kid gets beaten,
and our practice is okay.

576
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:53,404
Yay, us. Cooper, enough.

577
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:56,332
Hey, are you in on this, Sam?
I'm not taking sides.

578
00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:59,236
Well, I did. I took a side.
So did I, and I'd do it again.

579
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:19,411
Addison, this... we need you to deliver
Margaret Delhom's baby

580
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:20,444
Before her husband dies.

581
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:22,684
Uh, Gabriel Fife. Heard great things about you.

582
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,270
Yeah, uh, Addison Montgomery.
What happened?

583
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,973
Dr. Fife tried an experimental treatment.

584
00:27:27,973 --> 00:27:29,836
It didn't work. Neil doesn't have much time.

585
00:27:29,836 --> 00:27:32,284
Margaret still has six weeks
left. I can't deliver yet.

586
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:33,911
Babies come in at 34 weeks all the time.

587
00:27:33,911 --> 00:27:35,028
Do an amnio, check the lungs.

588
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,133
If they're mature, what's the problem?

589
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:39,770
The problem, Dr. Fife, is that human fetuses

590
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,424
are supposed to grow to 40
weeks before we yank them out.

591
00:27:42,424 --> 00:27:43,531
You yank them out?

592
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:45,560
You know, I thought the great
thing about being a doctor

593
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,683
was we could make things
happen that should happen.

594
00:27:47,683 --> 00:27:52,550
Well... he's fun.

595
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,127
Are you really on board with this?
I don't know.

596
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:56,545
Neil wants to meet his daughter.

597
00:27:56,545 --> 00:27:58,871
Margaret wants to be able to tell that baby

598
00:27:58,871 --> 00:28:01,592
that her father held her and loved her.

599
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,694
And that baby, she's gonna want to know it.

600
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:06,110
And I know all the reasons we
shouldn't deliver the baby now.

601
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:11,135
But I keep thinking about...
when Violet was attacked

602
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:13,971
and how I didn't know
if I'd ever meet Lucas.

603
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,774
I didn't know if I'd ever meet my son.

604
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:19,343
And I know...

605
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:22,680
that I would've done anything to meet him.

606
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,717
Easy.

607
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:31,355
Jail sucked, Sam.

608
00:28:31,423 --> 00:28:34,592
It sucked, and it was for nothing.

609
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:37,995
Well, coulda been worse.

610
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:42,366
It wasn't worse.

611
00:28:42,434 --> 00:28:44,135
Well, that's good.

612
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:45,603
Yeah.

613
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,037
That's good.

614
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:48,506
Ow.

615
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:50,975
Hello.

616
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:52,576
Evan?

617
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:55,513
I know Evan says I stabbed him, but I didn't.

618
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,581
I told you, I didn't hurt him.

619
00:28:57,649 --> 00:28:59,353
You left your son alone with his abuser?
No.

620
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:01,507
Get out of my way.
No, you're not touching
my son.

621
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:03,139
Me? You're worried about me?
I told you.

622
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:04,528
You didn't believe me.
You didn't believe Evan.

623
00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:06,367
I screwed up. I screwed up, okay?

624
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:09,591
But you're not touching him. Just...

625
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:13,153
I got this. Okay. I'm sorry.
Uh, I'm Dr. Sam Bennett.

626
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:14,395
I understand how you must be feeling.

627
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:16,708
Let me just go in there and give your son

628
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,371
the best medical treatment he could get.

629
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:22,386
Okay? Please.
Just let me help your son.

630
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:32,716
Are they gonna let my dad outta jail?

631
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:35,819
Uh, I don't know. But right now,
I'm concerned about you.

632
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:37,821
Am I... Gonna be okay?

633
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:39,156
Absolutely.

634
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:43,727
Dr. Bennett?

635
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:50,501
Get me 4-0 nylon, 1% lido with epi

636
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,903
and a suture kit.

637
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:57,675
It's one thing coming after me.
I can tell you to back off.

638
00:29:57,742 --> 00:29:59,082
But going to my wife is inexcusable.

639
00:29:59,082 --> 00:29:59,923
I... I came to see you.

640
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,013
Well, then you shoulda walked away.
I am so sorry if I upset her. I...

641
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,754
No, you upset me, all right?
I mean, maybe... maybe I hid it.

642
00:30:04,754 --> 00:30:06,307
Maybe I should've let all of you know

643
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:07,927
when we started seeing
each other, but I didn't,

644
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:10,498
because I was trying to figure
out how I was feeling by myself.
I get that.

645
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:11,568
Everyone gave you space

646
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:12,808
When you were trying
to figure out what you wanted.

647
00:30:12,808 --> 00:30:14,939
Besides Pete, no one got in your business

648
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:16,600
about the choices you've
been making about Lucas,

649
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,530
choices, by the way, which we don't all support...

650
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,684
You giving up your child.
But we, you know, we love you

651
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:23,625
and we respect you, and we
know this has been tough,

652
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,202
and we're just trying to be supportive.

653
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:27,131
So if... if you don't like
what I did, it's fine. Okay?

654
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:29,895
But respect it. If you can
respect Cooper for... for

655
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:32,193
committing a crime and putting
his career on the line,

656
00:30:32,193 --> 00:30:33,801
I would think you could respect me.

657
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:41,261
You want me to tell Cooper?

658
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:42,218
I will.

659
00:30:42,864 --> 00:30:44,520
Give me a minute to talk to Evan.
All right.

660
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,561
Now you said your stepfather did this to you.

661
00:30:48,561 --> 00:30:51,093
But your wounds are all even, Evan,

662
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:52,183
and they're superficial.

663
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,535
They're called intention marks.

664
00:30:54,535 --> 00:30:56,601
There's no way he did this to you.

665
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:59,007
You did this to yourself.

666
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:01,454
Why would you hurt yourself?

667
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:07,573
If I had proof...

668
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,181
that Ted hurt me...

669
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:15,486
they'd have to let my dad outta jail.

670
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:18,155
You can't tell anyone.

671
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:19,923
Please.

672
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:24,094
You want Ted to go to jail?
Let's find real evidence.

673
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:27,531
Tell me what he did to you.
Tell me everything.

674
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,833
We'll take x-rays, find proof.

675
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:33,771
We will put that son of a bitch in jail.

676
00:31:33,838 --> 00:31:37,441
You can tell me. Anything.

677
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:38,976
I can't.

678
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:40,878
Why not?

679
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:44,181
I didn't mean for all this to happen.

680
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:46,550
I just wanted Ted to go away.

681
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:49,186
So I told my mom Ted hit me.

682
00:31:49,254 --> 00:31:52,589
It was one lie to keep my parents together.

683
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:56,460
Only my dad believed me, and she didn't.

684
00:31:56,528 --> 00:31:58,862
So he took me away.

685
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,900
And once I started,
I... I didn't know how to stop.

686
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:06,203
So I kept lying and lying.

687
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:08,639
I didn't know what else to do.

688
00:32:11,242 --> 00:32:14,411
I... I didn't know what else to do.

689
00:32:17,492 --> 00:32:19,160
Aah! That's good, Margaret.

690
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:22,017
Okay, one more push. Ready?
On the count of three.

691
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:27,395
One, two... and three. Push. Push.

692
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:29,557
Okay. Great.The.

693
00:32:38,444 --> 00:32:40,679
Is she okay?

694
00:32:43,816 --> 00:32:46,051
She's perfect.

695
00:32:53,126 --> 00:32:56,228
Evan's okay.

696
00:32:56,295 --> 00:32:59,331
Turns out, uh, his wounds were superficial.

697
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:02,734
Intention wounds.

698
00:33:02,802 --> 00:33:04,403
He faked 'em, Cooper,

699
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,438
to get his father out of jail.

700
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:09,341
It turns out there was never any abuse.

701
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:11,276
He lied about all of it.

702
00:33:11,344 --> 00:33:12,744
No. Unh-unh.

703
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:15,180
No, I know this kid. That's not...

704
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:18,683
this chart doesn't prove that.

705
00:33:18,751 --> 00:33:22,187
You think I'm making this up?
Why would I do that?

706
00:33:22,255 --> 00:33:24,723
You told Addison. You, who can
keep a marriage a secret,

707
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,992
Couldn't keep this to yourself
when someone's life

708
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:29,394
Depended on it.
People lie, Cooper.

709
00:33:29,462 --> 00:33:30,861
I lied. You lied. He lied.

710
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:34,269
No. This is a good kid. You...
you, what, you bullied him?

711
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:36,169
You're a miserable bitch, so you bullied him?

712
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:37,935
You're trying to take
what you did and... and...

713
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:40,603
just because you are a liar, it
doesn't mean everyone else is.

714
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:43,183
I know he lied because he told me he lied.

715
00:33:43,183 --> 00:33:45,225
And you can call me
all the names you want to,

716
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:46,219
but it doesn't change that.

717
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,293
I met a guy, I fell in love and I married him.

718
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:59,635
And it ended badly, and I don't
like to go back there.

719
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:04,429
I was a different person.
And I am with you now.

720
00:34:04,497 --> 00:34:06,398
And there are things I coulda told you,

721
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:08,800
could tell you, that would make it easier,

722
00:34:08,868 --> 00:34:12,637
but... I don't want to go back there.

723
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:15,540
That is why I don't talk about it.

724
00:34:17,677 --> 00:34:19,377
We were gonna get married.

725
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:21,346
And you gave me a big speech

726
00:34:21,414 --> 00:34:24,249
about the big white wedding
and who you were

727
00:34:24,317 --> 00:34:26,985
and what you wanted and... and
how it was gonna be hard for you

728
00:34:27,053 --> 00:34:28,954
to walk down the aisle without big daddy.

729
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:30,822
So either you've already
walked down the aisle

730
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,290
without your father

731
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:35,227
or you'd already had your
big white wedding with him.

732
00:34:35,294 --> 00:34:38,396
You lied, Charlotte.

733
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,398
You lie.

734
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:48,633
Hey.

735
00:35:48,701 --> 00:35:51,102
I heard Evan's dad is getting out of jail,

736
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,105
that Lynn is dropping the charges.

737
00:35:54,173 --> 00:35:57,008
He's a child, Addison.
My job is to believe him.

738
00:35:57,076 --> 00:35:59,244
That's what I do. I believe people.

739
00:35:59,312 --> 00:36:03,048
At least... I did.

740
00:36:05,651 --> 00:36:08,119
I wish I could... trust,

741
00:36:08,187 --> 00:36:13,692
but... I've been burned too many times.

742
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:16,761
And that's why you didn't believe me?

743
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:18,863
I don't know. Maybe.

744
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:20,899
Well, I'd do it again.

745
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:24,436
I know. Because you
protect the people you love.

746
00:36:24,503 --> 00:36:28,340
Yeah. And you may think
we were doing the same thing,

747
00:36:28,407 --> 00:36:30,342
but you were wrong.

748
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:32,811
Even if I lied to you,

749
00:36:32,878 --> 00:36:36,448
even if Evan lied to me, you were wrong.

750
00:36:36,515 --> 00:36:39,351
You don't always know better.

751
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:58,136
I thought you'd want to know,

752
00:36:58,204 --> 00:37:02,040
Neil Delhom got to meet his baby. I know.

753
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:04,342
You feel good about that? Don't you?

754
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,277
I am happy for them.

755
00:37:06,345 --> 00:37:07,879
I think you are happy

756
00:37:07,947 --> 00:37:11,016
because you pushed the envelope and you won.

757
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:11,881
Chalk one up for science.

758
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:13,541
What does it matter?
I got it done. Did you?

759
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:15,868
You take risks. You push people.

760
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:18,585
Only you don't have to pay
the price if you fail.

761
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:21,446
Of course I do. Failure costs me everything.

762
00:37:21,446 --> 00:37:23,466
It costs my patients everything.

763
00:37:23,466 --> 00:37:26,016
And what about what it cost Neil
to put him through that?

764
00:37:26,016 --> 00:37:28,118
Yes, a man will die who was gonna die anyway.

765
00:37:28,118 --> 00:37:31,553
But if it had worked, a lot
of people would've lived...

766
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:34,272
still might from what I've learned...

767
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,399
and all of them, they matter to me.

768
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:39,755
What?

769
00:37:40,455 --> 00:37:41,229
Nothing.

770
00:37:42,717 --> 00:37:44,752
It's just, you wouldn't
know it to look at you,

771
00:37:44,752 --> 00:37:47,814
that you care.

772
00:37:50,523 --> 00:37:52,657
Sorry I'm not more user-friendly.

773
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:56,194
Me, too.

774
00:38:06,572 --> 00:38:08,540
This is a congratulatory plant...

775
00:38:08,607 --> 00:38:12,143
an... apologetic,

776
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:14,446
congratury plant.

777
00:38:14,513 --> 00:38:16,347
I'm so sorry, Dell.

778
00:38:16,415 --> 00:38:19,617
I... I should not have talked to Heather.

779
00:38:19,685 --> 00:38:21,953
But... but I'm glad I did.

780
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:23,555
She seemed good.

781
00:38:23,622 --> 00:38:25,790
She's doing everything she can for Betsey.

782
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,628
You have done an amazing thing for your daughter.

783
00:38:30,696 --> 00:38:33,598
You know, I, you know,
I love my daughter, Violet.

784
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:36,701
But getting back together with
Heather, that wasn't for her.

785
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:38,603
I love Heather.

786
00:38:38,671 --> 00:38:41,039
We fell in love again.

787
00:38:41,107 --> 00:38:42,117
And you're really happy?

788
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:45,543
Yeah, I am.

789
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:47,746
Well...

790
00:38:49,448 --> 00:38:51,483
You deserve it.

791
00:38:53,385 --> 00:38:55,887
Violet.

792
00:38:55,955 --> 00:38:57,989
So do you.

793
00:39:08,033 --> 00:39:09,400
Can I come in?

794
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:21,513
You always get the best room.

795
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,382
I'm a Montgomery.

796
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:27,285
Do... do you want to...

797
00:39:27,353 --> 00:39:29,254
Oh, no.

798
00:39:29,321 --> 00:39:30,989
Yes.

799
00:39:50,543 --> 00:39:52,977
I was thinking about
how I used to take you

800
00:39:53,045 --> 00:39:54,913
out on the boat when you were little,

801
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,514
just you and me,

802
00:39:56,582 --> 00:39:58,683
and I'd teach you how to sail.

803
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:01,352
We'd sail together.

804
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,556
Those were our bestimes.

805
00:40:07,493 --> 00:40:09,460
Yes.

806
00:40:09,528 --> 00:40:11,196
They were.

807
00:40:11,263 --> 00:40:13,798
I want more best times,

808
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:16,234
just you and me.

809
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:22,807
You're not my family.

810
00:40:24,844 --> 00:40:26,744
I have a family.

811
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:29,814
They come to work with me every day,

812
00:40:29,882 --> 00:40:31,950
and we care about each other.

813
00:40:32,017 --> 00:40:34,719
We take care of each other.

814
00:40:34,787 --> 00:40:37,655
And when we lie for each other,

815
00:40:37,723 --> 00:40:40,124
it's for a reason, it's for good,

816
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:43,628
it's for lives saved.

817
00:40:43,696 --> 00:40:46,297
They're my fily,

818
00:40:46,365 --> 00:40:47,799
not you.

819
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:50,802
I'm sorry, but...

820
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,770
not you.

821
00:40:55,307 --> 00:40:57,208
But you came here.

822
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:00,745
I don't forgive you.

823
00:41:02,314 --> 00:41:03,715
But you're here.

824
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:09,587
I am.

825
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:10,884
I'm here.
