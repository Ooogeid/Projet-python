1
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:28,376
Are you gonna be home late tonight?

2
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:32,010
Uh, well, I have a baby to deliver

3
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,492
If she doesn't want? I want you.

4
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:39,111
Tell you what. You get in the bed and when
I get home, I'll tuck you in. I promise.

5
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:40,738
I love you.

6
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:26,296
- You came.
- I've been summoned.

7
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:33,860
- Future under 14D.
- No.

8
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,488
- Addison.
- If you wanna tell me something, tell me why she is coming.

9
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:42,382
You can ask her yourself.

10
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:46,745
- Where are you going?
- Just wanted to make sure you'd showe up. Now that you're here...

11
00:01:46,745 --> 00:01:50,444
What? Captain. You can't
just... Bizzy is you...

12
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,999
- What is going on?
- Ask your mother.

13
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:05,639
- You cut your hair.
- Yes, I... wanted, uh, something different.

14
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:14,063
So, uh, captain was here but
he left us to chat, is he?

15
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:15,541
It was a dreadful flight.

16
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:19,377
- Dreadful staff. Dreadful food. I'm gonna make a complaint to Wills.
- Right.

17
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:24,735
I cannot believe you moved
to this place. But here I am.

18
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:28,032
Yes, about that. I was surprised
that you actually came to visit.

19
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:35,805
Addison... don't push. You know short hair isn't
for everyone. Some people look older with them.

20
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:46,798
Absolutely gorgeous.

21
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:49,086
I think we'll win first
place this year at New Haven.

22
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:51,199
The Silvermans' tulips were...

23
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,741
you could cut the tension with a knife,

24
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,677
but they're smiling, they're drinking,

25
00:02:55,544 --> 00:02:58,580
they're chatting about flowers.

26
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:01,449
Hmm. Trust me, they are
not chatting about flowers.

27
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:04,052
They are speaking wasp.

28
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:06,187
We learn it at an early age.

29
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:08,723
- What are they saying?
- See? Now that's the thing.

30
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,025
Usually I know,

31
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:13,862
but this time, I have no idea.

32
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:16,373
Maybe I'm crazy. I mean,
maybe everything is fine,

33
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:19,237
which would be creepy
because nothing is ever fine.

34
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:22,003
- Oh, here she comes.
- Ah, Mrs. Montgomery.

35
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:25,765
Now, Samuel, how many
times have I told you

36
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:26,679
to call me Bizzy?

37
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:29,976
Yes, Mrs. Montgom... Bizzy. Ma'am.

38
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:33,460
What is that?

39
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,694
Milo. I've deced to give
up men and get a cat.

40
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:39,747
Don't say that. That's so sad.

41
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:41,467
People will believe you.

42
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,666
And you'll have to
lock it up or something.

43
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:46,131
Well, if your father and I
are gonna be staying here...

44
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:50,295
- Stay here?
- Let me just get that for you.

45
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:53,144
So, Bizzy, uh, what
brings you here to L.A.?

46
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:57,472
Excuse me.

47
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:02,010
Yes.

48
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,286
- Sam?
- It's Dell.

49
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:07,049
Dell, what happened?

50
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:08,663
I... I don't know. The
house, it just exploded.

51
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:10,541
- It had to have been a gas leak. I don't know.
- It's okay.

52
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,486
24-year-old female,
extensive second-

53
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,210
and third-degree burns,
possible inhalion injury.

54
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,338
BP's 100 over 60. Pulse 130.

55
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:22,334
Let's go.

56
00:04:22,206 --> 00:04:24,870
On my count. Ready? One, two, three.

57
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,908
I need high-flow 0-2.
I'm gonna need a blood gas

58
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:28,682
- and a carboxyhemoglobin.
- We're on it, Cooper.

59
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:30,605
I... I tried to get 'em both
out, but... but the flames...

60
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,479
I could hear heather screaming,
but I couldn't see anything,

61
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,923
So I got Betsey. By the
time I got to Heather, she...

62
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:37,292
I... I could... I... I couldn't get them both.
- Dell, you did all the right things.

63
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,201
- Let's get a liter of lactated ringers.
- Hey, do you mind?

64
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,730
You're interfering with our protocol.

65
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,268
Okay, guys. You have
to let my team work.

66
00:04:42,268 --> 00:04:43,906
- They do this every day.
- It's not Dell every day.

67
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:49,128
- I know that. Now step back, both of you.
- I... I need to be with both of them.

68
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,276
- What do I...
- Pete, go with Heather.

69
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:53,210
You go with your
daughter. Okay, let's move.

70
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,996
I'll get you an update as
soon as I can, Dell. Let's go.

71
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,196
Please don't let her die.

72
00:04:58,095 --> 00:04:58,999
Get out of the way now.

73
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:01,450
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

74
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:09,635
Okay, Heather.

75
00:05:09,878 --> 00:05:12,109
- No! Betsey! Where's Betsey?!
- Heather, you're...

76
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:13,740
You need to keep the mask on.

77
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,120
- No!
- Heather, you need to keep the mask on.

78
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,211
- Where's Betsey?!
- Betsey is alive. She's unconscious.

79
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:20,672
She's in the E.R.
Cooper is working on her.

80
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:23,294
Dell is with her. Now you
need to keep the mask on.

81
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:25,260
She's got second-and
third-degree burns

82
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,586
over 60% of her body.

83
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:31,059
- Her lungs have sustained severe inhalation injuries.
- We should have an ecmo unit standing by.

84
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:32,808
- I've already ordered it.
- Let's give her morphine.

85
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:35,072
- Do you know her well?
- I used to work with her husband.

86
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:37,851
- What's the prognosis?
- In my experience,

87
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:39,513
30% chance of survival.

88
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,436
Dell, I'm so sorry.

89
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,861
- Is there anything... anything we can do?
- I... I'm supposed to deliver the Higgins baby.

90
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:54,704
- They're gonna be waiting for me.
- I... I already took care of it.

91
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:57,081
- The on-call doctor is gonna
deliver. It's fine. - Okay.

92
00:05:57,905 --> 00:05:59,399
Did I give my insurance card?

93
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:00,890
They're gonna... they're gonna need...

94
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,758
Dell, I'll... I'll make sure they
have all the information, okay?

95
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:07,453
Hey.

96
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:10,760
Hey, Dell, I took a look
at Betsey's C.T. scan.

97
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,633
She has a moderate brain contusion

98
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,934
and she also has carbon
monoxide poisoning.

99
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:16,533
Now most people wake up in a few hours,

100
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:19,607
but because she's so small,
it's gonna take a little longer.

101
00:06:24,907 --> 00:06:27,397
- Heather... how is she?
- I don't have an update on Heather from Pete yet.

102
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,389
But they know what caused the explosion.

103
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:34,029
- Okay.
- Maybe we should go outside.

104
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,522
- Just say it.
- Um...

105
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,595
Heather was cooking meth.

106
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:40,429
They think it was ether.

107
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,759
Dell, we've got Heather stabilized.

108
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,877
She's asking for you. I know
you don't want to leave Betsey,

109
00:06:46,877 --> 00:06:47,600
but it...

110
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,349
Heather.

111
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:02,980
Don't try to speak.

112
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,960
Can you hear me?

113
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,489
Can you understand me?

114
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:08,938
Good.

115
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:16,151
I hope you die, bitch.

116
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:19,950
You almost killed my daughter.

117
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,153
I hope you die a miserable...

118
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:32,648
painful, agonizing death.

119
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,993
You're almost there,
Heather. Almost there.

120
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:43,329
After this, we're gonna
test your lung function.

121
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,756
Help us decide our next move, okay?

122
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:48,526
He hates me. He wants me
to die. Just let me die.

123
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:50,339
Heather, listen to
me. You can't give up.

124
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,607
Dell doesn't want you to die.

125
00:07:51,907 --> 00:07:53,825
He's upset and he's
worried about Betsey.

126
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:55,631
But you gotta fight,
okay? You gotta fight.

127
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:57,846
Give me more drugs.
Please. Just make it stop!

128
00:07:58,946 --> 00:07:59,145
Okay, Heather.

129
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,434
- He said that?
- He's upset.

130
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:06,648
It's his way of dealing
with a tragic situation.

131
00:08:06,648 --> 00:08:07,514
To tell somebody

132
00:08:07,414 --> 00:08:09,644
who's fighting for their
life you want them to die?

133
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:11,661
I don't care what she did.
That's crossing a line.

134
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:13,457
He couldn't have meant it.

135
00:08:13,357 --> 00:08:16,031
Do you guys think he knew that
heather was doing drugs again?

136
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:22,082
I got you all coffee.

137
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:24,572
I'm gonna go check on Heather.

138
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,785
I didn't know about the drugs.

139
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:33,673
I wouldn't have put Betsey in
danger like that if I knew...

140
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:35,674
since you were all wondering.

141
00:08:35,374 --> 00:08:36,744
Dell, no o... no one thought...

142
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:39,307
It's cold in here. She hates the cold.

143
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,268
You know, she's always asking
for more blankets at night.

144
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:50,602
- She needs another blanket.
- Okay, you know what, Dell?

145
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:53,105
Why don't... we're gonna
go and talk to a nurse

146
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:54,726
and see if we can get some more, okay?

147
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:00,036
God, can you believe all this?

148
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:00,712
I know.

149
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:02,587
I feel terrible.

150
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:05,308
I... I feel like I really
should've pushed him harder.

151
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:06,746
I should've made him really think

152
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,582
about letting heather
back into their lives.

153
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,444
Nai, there's nothing you
could've done differently,

154
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:13,463
- Nothing anyone could've done differently.
- Well, maybe you're right. I don't know.

155
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:17,083
Hey, wait. Let... let... let's
just have a 1-minute mental break.

156
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,466
Sure. Maya?

157
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:22,856
Same... hating me and
loving Pink or Rink or Dink.

158
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:24,775
- Whatever his name is.
- Bizzy?

159
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:27,087
The same... cocktails, cold smiles...

160
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:28,351
You know, maternal.

161
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:30,914
Something's going on, but...

162
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:33,593
Bizzy.

163
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:35,159
Yes.

164
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,469
I will pick up some
more on the way home.

165
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:40,198
- Bye.
- Crisis?

166
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:42,780
- More gin.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

167
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,736
Me, too.

168
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,397
Addie.

169
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,609
Susan? What...

170
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,200
- Oh, what are you doing here?
- Hi.

171
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,292
Oh, my God. You look great. You look...

172
00:09:57,492 --> 00:10:01,545
- How long has it been? You look exactly the same.
- Oh, about eight years, and I look a mess.

173
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:03,016
You have your mother's skin.

174
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,887
Oh. So how is it?

175
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:06,452
She's driving me crazy.

176
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:09,277
He is driving me crazy. I don't
know how you work for them.

177
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:11,608
Remember to breathe and many cocktails.

178
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:13,795
What are you doing here?

179
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:17,162
- You know Bizzy's rule... wherever she goes, I go.
- Susan, why is she here?

180
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:23,420
- I have no idea.
- She didn't tell you? You really don't know?

181
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,889
Let's go face the dragon?

182
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:28,826
Breathe. Many cocktails.

183
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:29,819
Hey.

184
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:31,119
Look who I found.

185
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,365
Susan.

186
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,848
I brought the documents for
the Houston charity ball.

187
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:37,632
Hello, captain.

188
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,785
Who wants... a drink?

189
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:50,792
Excuse me.

190
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:54,316
You're turning down drinks?

191
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:55,895
Good night, Addison.

192
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,466
- Did something happen with Dell?
- No, no.

193
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:11,351
Susan... she runs the family
office. Do you remember her?

194
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:14,121
I like her. I mean, she's
close in age to me, you know,

195
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:14,994
and she would do things for me.

196
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,414
She would deal with my mother for me.

197
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,903
A... a... anyway, she's been
working for us for 20 years.

198
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,974
She's like one of the family.
She shows up here and...

199
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:25,634
And what is it?

200
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,482
I think the captain's sleeping with her.

201
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,146
I think that's why he sent for Bizzy,

202
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:32,395
because anywhere Bizzy
goes, Susan goes, too.

203
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:34,561
He invited his wife out

204
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,638
so that she would bring his mistress?

205
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:39,071
That's my father. And
my mother trusts her.

206
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:40,678
I mean, she lives on the estate.

207
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,920
You know, and now he does this? Ugh.

208
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,664
I mean, right under Bizzy's nose.

209
00:11:44,664 --> 00:11:48,078
And now they're here in my
house. Uh, I need a drink.

210
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:50,119
- No, no, no, you don't.
- Oh, I do.

211
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:52,201
What you need to... you need
to tell those people to leave

212
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:53,577
instead of putting up with their lies.

213
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:56,686
Just kick 'em out before
your liver drowns in gin.

214
00:11:56,686 --> 00:12:01,103
Sam, I can't tell the
captain and Bizzy to leave.

215
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:03,736
They're the captain...and Bizzy.

216
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:06,972
You are Addison Adrianne
Forbes Montgomery.

217
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:09,476
You have more names
than anybody else I know.

218
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:11,252
Tell them to leave.

219
00:12:12,508 --> 00:12:13,274
I can do it.

220
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:17,701
- I could... tell them to leave.
- Tell them to leave.

221
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,105
Tell 'em to leave.

222
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:22,973
Good girl.

223
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:27,166
Everything's gonna be okay.

224
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,199
Don't worry.

225
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,186
I love you.

226
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:33,384
Susan?

227
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:35,883
Oh, captain. Bizzy's
right down the hall.

228
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:39,928
Captain...

229
00:12:53,343 --> 00:12:55,377
Addison?

230
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:56,188
How'd it go?

231
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,131
What was Bizzy's face like...

232
00:12:58,131 --> 00:13:01,708
What happened?

233
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,074
I can't... I... I can't.
I just... I... I...

234
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,509
Do you mind if I spend the night here?

235
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:10,594
I... I promise I'll, um, I'll
stay on my side of the bed.

236
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:11,407
Yeah, sure.

237
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:02,334
Morning.

238
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:08,551
You're short.

239
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:11,779
I mean, usually you're in heels,

240
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:13,681
very high heels.

241
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,596
I hope you don't take
that as a criticism.

242
00:14:20,297 --> 00:14:22,897
It's a, nice change.

243
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:26,454
You okay?

244
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:30,015
14 down. I'm stumped on 14 down.

245
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,911
- I'm sorry.
- I was working a crossword puzzle yesterday,

246
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:35,100
and I couldn't figure out
14 down... "future hunters."

247
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,235
- Future hunters is a clue?
- Yes. Do you know the answer?

248
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:41,122
- I don't...
- "Future hunters." I know I know the answer to that.

249
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:42,282
It's just not coming to me right now.

250
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,359
If I could just figure out the answer...

251
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:46,344
and I... I know how I sound. I know.

252
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,223
I know that if I look
at you, you'll like...

253
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:50,550
think I'm some sort of
crazy woman or something.

254
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,727
I... but trust me, you want me
to be thinking about 14 down.

255
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:54,948
If I don't think about 14
down, then I'm just gonna have

256
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:56,072
a nervous breakdown in this elevator,

257
00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:57,662
and I can't do that right now. I can't.

258
00:15:04,907 --> 00:15:06,600
Why don't I ride up with
you the rest of the way?

259
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:28,922
You want to come to my office?

260
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,732
Do you believe that people are owed?

261
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:47,716
I sometimes believe that
you're owed, you know?

262
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:50,686
And I think Betsey's owed one.

263
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:53,322
She's just had such a tough life...

264
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,326
you know, teenage parents
and a mom on drugs.

265
00:15:57,394 --> 00:16:00,663
And I'll never know what
this has done to her.

266
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,365
But I figured she's owed, right?

267
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:06,202
She's had it so bad, that
this can't be her end,

268
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:09,572
'cause then what was her life for...

269
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,740
Just suffering?

270
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:13,442
That would be cruel.

271
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,644
That would be just beyond cruel.

272
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,148
Dell.

273
00:16:19,216 --> 00:16:21,350
Betsey, hey. Betsey.

274
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:22,695
- Uh, get it out, Naomi. Just get it out.
- Just relax.

275
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,833
I'm gonna count to three, and
then I want you to blow out.

276
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,107
One, two, three.

277
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:32,394
It's okay.

278
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:35,097
there you go. Good girl.

279
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:38,033
- Okay, good job, kiddo. You're okay.
- I'm gonna go get Cooper.

280
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:40,469
Okay, okay. Hey, hey, it's okay.

281
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:42,671
It's gonna be okay.

282
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:45,941
Where's mommy?

283
00:16:49,145 --> 00:16:50,513
Where's Betsey?

284
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,582
Heather, your potassium is
too high from tissue damage.

285
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,118
It's affecting your heart
rhythm. You need oxigen.

286
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:58,787
- Okay. What do we got? -
She's having runs of v-tach.

287
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:01,690
Lido 75 I.V. Push. I need that calcium.

288
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:04,727
V-fib. Charge  200. Everybody off.

289
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:06,996
Clear.

290
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:10,132
Is she dead?

291
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,500
No.

292
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:14,036
Heather crashed. We
got her heart started,

293
00:17:14,104 --> 00:17:16,372
but she's dying, and she knows it.

294
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,040
Dell, I know you're angry,

295
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:20,609
but Heather is going to die.
You can choose not to see her,

296
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:23,212
- but she wants to see her daughter.
- No.

297
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,614
- Dell, it's her mother.
- No, a mother is someone who... who loves her,

298
00:17:25,682 --> 00:17:27,483
who wouldn't have done this to her,

299
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,518
someone she's supposed to
have good memories about.

300
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:30,387
She should not have memories
of her mother burnt to a crisp

301
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:32,187
because she didn't give enough
of a damn about her daughter

302
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:34,097
or me or anyone else to stay off drugs.

303
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,823
No, Pete. I'm not gonna
let my daughter's last view

304
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,381
of her mother be this. Just no.

305
00:17:39,863 --> 00:17:41,698
I hate him so much.

306
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:43,264
You hate your father for...

307
00:17:44,254 --> 00:17:45,751
For breaking her heart...

308
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:48,593
For forcing her to do this.

309
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:51,497
He cheated on her for
40 years. She had no one.

310
00:17:51,497 --> 00:17:53,227
She had no one to talk
to, no one to comfort her.

311
00:17:53,227 --> 00:17:56,345
- Of course she turned to Susan.
- Is it possible that this relationship with Susan

312
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:58,775
is your mother's choice?

313
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:03,714
I know what it's like, okay...

314
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:06,054
to be rejected,

315
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:08,545
to have your heart broken,

316
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,136
to... be lonely.

317
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:13,040
Is that how you feel now?

318
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:15,198
Okay, we're not talking about
me. We're talking about her.

319
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:17,166
Actually, we're not talking about her.

320
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:19,836
We're talking about your
father, which is interesting.

321
00:18:19,903 --> 00:18:21,471
You had this traumatic experience

322
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:23,940
- involving your mother...
- It wasn't traumatic.

323
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,850
- Okay.
- You suck as a therapist.

324
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:28,411
Okay.

325
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,213
Why am I here?

326
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,615
I don't know why I'm
here. Why am I here?

327
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:34,584
Uh, maybe because I'm a stranger.

328
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:37,520
You can talk to me,
tell me... your feelings.

329
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:40,223
I'm neutral. I'm Switzerland.

330
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,593
I'm just here to listen.

331
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:49,065
It wasn't traumatic.

332
00:18:53,137 --> 00:18:56,606
Addison, I'm here to help you...

333
00:18:56,673 --> 00:18:58,541
and to talk and to let you talk,

334
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:01,744
but I'm not sure you're focusing
on the right things here.

335
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:03,613
And I'm sure that I am.

336
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,715
Then why didn't you get off the elevator

337
00:19:05,783 --> 00:19:09,018
when you saw your mother?

338
00:19:09,086 --> 00:19:11,988
You might be right about
your mother and your father.

339
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:13,956
And far be it from me

340
00:19:14,024 --> 00:19:15,892
to question what should make you angry.

341
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:19,495
But... you haven't talked
to either one of them.

342
00:19:19,563 --> 00:19:21,531
And your point is?

343
00:19:21,598 --> 00:19:25,001
Well, maybe you need
to get off the elevator.

344
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:30,306
Are you sure it's okay
for her to have ice cream?

345
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:32,775
Yeah. Wouldn't hurt for
you to get some food, too.

346
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:34,744
I just want to start over.

347
00:19:34,812 --> 00:19:37,647
I just want to get as far away from this day as
possible. Get her home, not that we have a home.

348
00:19:37,714 --> 00:19:39,664
Come stay with me. My home is yours.

349
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:42,076
- You know that. As long as you need.
- You guys, good news.

350
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:44,080
Betsey's neurological
exam is completely normal.

351
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,794
She shows no evidence of
any kind of ongoing problems.

352
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:49,177
7 year olds are resilient as hell.

353
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:52,113
So I would like to keep her
another day to monitor her,

354
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:54,730
just as a precaution, but she's
officially out of the woods.

355
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,333
That is great, which means you can eat.

356
00:19:57,401 --> 00:19:59,769
So I'm gonna go to the cafeteria,
I'm gonna get you some food,

357
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:02,591
- and no arguments.
- Okay. Thank you.

358
00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:03,647
You're welcome.

359
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:10,481
Uh, w... where's my daughter?

360
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:11,636
She's with Dr. Wilder.

361
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:18,629
Betsey, I want you to be prepared.

362
00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:21,691
Your mom is all bandaged
up to keep her wounds clean.

363
00:20:21,758 --> 00:20:24,627
So don't be scared, okay?

364
00:20:24,695 --> 00:20:26,162
You ready?

365
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,497
Betsey.

366
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:28,831
Dell.

367
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:31,033
Betsey?

368
00:20:31,101 --> 00:20:32,168
Daddy!

369
00:20:32,236 --> 00:20:33,703
- Betsey.
- Daddy!

370
00:20:35,597 --> 00:20:35,838
Bring her back.

371
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:41,454
Oh, Mrs. Montgomery.

372
00:20:42,302 --> 00:20:43,666
What are you doing here?

373
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:47,336
- I'm waiting for Addison.
- Addison is not here this morning.

374
00:20:47,336 --> 00:20:49,397
She actually, uh, went to... she's here.

375
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:50,883
She knows I'm here.

376
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:54,468
Have you talked with her?

377
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:55,201
Not yet.

378
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:57,689
Have you?

379
00:20:58,516 --> 00:21:00,890
I have not talked with her.

380
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,531
Hey, Sam. I'm... I'm sorry to interrupt.

381
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:05,577
- I'm gonna go back to the hospital now.
- Violet,this is Addison mother

382
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:06,812
Mrs. Montgomery.

383
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:09,837
Hello.

384
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:14,319
I'm sorry. I have to go now.

385
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:16,855
And what do you do here at my
daughter's practice, Violet?

386
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:19,625
I... I... I'm a psychiatrist.

387
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:21,493
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

388
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:24,496
Have you met my husband... the captain?

389
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:26,965
Um... I...

390
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:29,101
Yeah, uh, once or twice.

391
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:32,104
Did you meet him once or
did you meet him twice?

392
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:36,475
Twice.

393
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:39,845
Yes, I believe twice.

394
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:54,159
I was hoping we could
do some shopping today

395
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:57,029
And then have lunch.

396
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:04,503
What are you doing? What's going on?

397
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:06,872
Okay, that was a mistake.

398
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,774
Mother, I'm just...

399
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:10,809
I'm so sorry

400
00:22:10,877 --> 00:22:13,812
About what happened,
about what he did to you.

401
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,682
- Who did what to me?
- Look, I know, I know. We don't talk.

402
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:18,684
We chat about, uh, flowers

403
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:21,854
and pretend that he's
not... cheating on you.

404
00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:24,990
But let's not do that
anymore. Let's face it.

405
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:28,060
I'll face it with you.

406
00:22:28,128 --> 00:22:29,962
You've gotta be lonely
and... and alone and...

407
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:32,731
Addison, this is not your concern.

408
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,400
It's not my... you're my mother.

409
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:36,869
Exactly.

410
00:22:36,936 --> 00:22:39,171
Let's not discuss these things.

411
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,739
No, we have to.

412
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:45,944
You're wrong... about your father.

413
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:49,114
I'm wrong. Bizzy, don't...

414
00:22:49,182 --> 00:22:53,218
He drove you to kiss another woman.

415
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:59,424
Susan... has been with me for 20 years.

416
00:22:59,492 --> 00:23:00,859
Yes, I know.

417
00:23:00,927 --> 00:23:03,795
She's worked with us for
ages, which is why it's...

418
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:08,433
Susan has been with me for 20 years.

419
00:23:11,237 --> 00:23:13,872
So, uh...

420
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,642
shopping and then lunch?

421
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,810
Mother...

422
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:21,180
Sit down.

423
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:37,129
There was one girl in boarding school

424
00:23:37,197 --> 00:23:38,931
when I was 14.

425
00:23:38,998 --> 00:23:41,833
And then there was the one
in Switzerland on holiday

426
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:44,303
when I was 17, but those don't count.

427
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,773
It was cold, and we were girls.

428
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,641
But...

429
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:53,312
then I met Susan.

430
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:54,780
And the captain?

431
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,748
- What about him?
- Does he know?

432
00:23:56,816 --> 00:23:58,951
We don't discuss it,

433
00:23:59,018 --> 00:24:00,819
but, yes, he knows.

434
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:03,689
I think he's always known.

435
00:24:07,694 --> 00:24:10,295
Did you ever love him?

436
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:15,601
Oh, my... Bizzy, why did you marry him?

437
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:18,103
We're from Connecticut.

438
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:20,539
My father is a Bradford Forbes.

439
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:23,575
Okay, so... let me get this straight.

440
00:24:23,643 --> 00:24:26,245
You were the cheating whore, not dad?

441
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:27,746
I'm gonna go.

442
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:29,781
If you're gonna talk like that, I'll go.

443
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:32,618
You have no idea how difficult it was.

444
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:35,487
Oh, come on, Bizzy. How
hard could it have been?

445
00:24:35,555 --> 00:24:37,422
I mean, nothing was expected of you.

446
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,358
All you had to was order
the housekeeper around,

447
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:40,859
run your charities

448
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:43,428
and screw your husband
every Wednesday night.

449
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:46,431
How complicated is that?

450
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:48,000
You have no idea.

451
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:50,068
You don't know me.

452
00:24:50,136 --> 00:24:52,337
You don't know me. You
don't know anything.

453
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:54,940
You don't know one
single thing about me.

454
00:24:55,008 --> 00:24:56,842
I could have done things.

455
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:59,244
I could have... been things.

456
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:01,913
But I'm a Forbes.

457
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:05,017
So I got married because that
was what I was supposed to do.

458
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:07,753
And I chose your father because he asked

459
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,688
and he was nice

460
00:25:09,756 --> 00:25:13,058
and he seemed like he
wouldn't suffocate me.

461
00:25:13,126 --> 00:25:17,429
And by the time I realized
my mistake, I had children.

462
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:20,032
So I made a life.

463
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:22,968
I did what I could wi what I had.

464
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:25,837
And I may not have been
in love with your father,

465
00:25:25,905 --> 00:25:27,272
but I loved him.

466
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,374
I do love him.

467
00:25:29,442 --> 00:25:31,310
And I loved you and your brother.

468
00:25:31,377 --> 00:25:34,012
And so instead of
doing what I wanted to,

469
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,816
which was run or slit my wrists,

470
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:41,019
I threw birthday parties and I smiled

471
00:25:41,087 --> 00:25:43,221
and I kept my mouth shut.

472
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:45,157
And I raised you and your brother,

473
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:47,559
and you both turned out brilliantly.

474
00:25:47,627 --> 00:25:48,994
Susan was for me.

475
00:25:49,062 --> 00:25:51,997
Susan was the one thing that was for me.

476
00:25:52,065 --> 00:25:54,399
My children took everything else.

477
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:58,036
And I'm sorry, but
until you have a child,

478
00:25:58,104 --> 00:26:01,239
you have no idea what
it's like to be a mother.

479
00:26:01,307 --> 00:26:03,175
You have no idea

480
00:26:03,242 --> 00:26:06,712
the sacrifices a woman
makes when she has children.

481
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:11,516
So don't you dare judge me.

482
00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:20,592
What the hell were you thinking?

483
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,229
- Naomi had to call me to calm Dell down.
- He can decide whatever he wants for himself,

484
00:26:24,297 --> 00:26:28,207
- but that little girl wants her mother.
- That is not yours to say. You made it worse and...

485
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:30,616
Don't you dare lecture me
about making things worse.

486
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:33,739
- You don't get to lecture me.
- Dell... stop!

487
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:35,974
Dell!

488
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:38,043
- You want to hit me? Fine.
- Get off!

489
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:40,011
But there's a woman
in there who you loved,

490
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,913
the mother of your child, her child,

491
00:26:41,981 --> 00:26:43,882
who desperately wants to see her.

492
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,284
Yeah, you're pissed. You
have a right to be pissed.

493
00:26:46,352 --> 00:26:48,220
But if you don't make
peace with this, Dell,

494
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:50,188
if you don't make peace with it now,
you're never gonna get another chance,

495
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:50,911
- and it will eat at you.
- Get off!

496
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:55,328
- Dell, let Betsey see her mother before she dies.
- Stay away from me!

497
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:58,331
Just stay the hell away from my family!

498
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:03,302
- You want to tell me this isn't personal?
- You know,

499
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,204
maybe you can condone keeping
a child away from their mother,

500
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:07,206
maybe that makes sense
to you. Not to me.

501
00:27:07,274 --> 00:27:08,708
Heather made a mistake,

502
00:27:08,776 --> 00:27:11,077
but if that child doesn't
get to say goodbye,

503
00:27:11,145 --> 00:27:13,713
you tell me what it does to that kid.

504
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,144
Drink before you speak.

505
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:52,385
She's very upset.

506
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:55,221
Is she? I'm sorry. That's so sad.

507
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:57,323
Drink some more.

508
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:01,194
Just give me one good reason

509
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:04,363
why my entire childhood was
a lie... one good reason.

510
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:06,799
We were trying to
protect you and Archer.

511
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:09,202
Really? Because I'm a
cheater, Archer's a cheater.

512
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:11,204
We're all these awesome cheaters.

513
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:14,006
So, you know, that's a bunch
of crap... protecting us.

514
00:28:14,074 --> 00:28:16,375
I want a good reason.

515
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:19,612
She's the love of my life.

516
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,114
We've been married for 40 years...

517
00:28:22,182 --> 00:28:24,484
40 years.

518
00:28:24,551 --> 00:28:28,254
My entire adult life,
she has been at my side.

519
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:30,623
I love her. She's my best friend.

520
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:35,094
She's my... everything.

521
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:38,231
It's not her fault, you
know? She didn't know.

522
00:28:38,298 --> 00:28:40,800
We didn't know.

523
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:43,669
And when we did...

524
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:46,272
She's the love of my
life. It's complicated.

525
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:50,610
Love is complicated.

526
00:28:50,677 --> 00:28:53,312
Being a lesbian is not a choice.

527
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,548
She's not going to change her mind.

528
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:58,551
Hell, she's practically screwing
Susan right under your nose.

529
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:00,052
The mouth on you...

530
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,889
you know... she sleeps with one woman.

531
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:04,857
I sleep with all the rest. So what?!

532
00:29:04,925 --> 00:29:06,826
And that's good enough for you?

533
00:29:06,894 --> 00:29:08,327
My entire life,

534
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:11,197
I thought she was this
poor, pathetic woman.

535
00:29:11,265 --> 00:29:14,033
I thought it was my
job to cover for you.

536
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:15,968
And it made me hate you.

537
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:17,403
I mean, don't you understand?

538
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:20,100
I hated the wrong parent.

539
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,008
I... my cheating? I
thought I got it from you.

540
00:29:22,075 --> 00:29:24,877
But now I know that you're
the poor, pathetic one,

541
00:29:24,945 --> 00:29:27,747
because you love her, and
she loves someone else.

542
00:29:27,814 --> 00:29:29,282
But you stay.

543
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:32,485
This is like some pathetic,
sad, afterschool special,

544
00:29:32,653 --> 00:29:34,420
which is just awful, because now,

545
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:36,889
now I hate you both.

546
00:29:40,627 --> 00:29:43,029
Eaglets.

547
00:29:44,464 --> 00:29:45,965
What?

548
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:49,769
14 down. "future hunters."

549
00:29:49,836 --> 00:29:51,804
It's eaglets.

550
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:06,052
Thought I heard you come in.

551
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,553
Betsey woke up.

552
00:30:07,621 --> 00:30:09,488
Got the call.

553
00:30:09,556 --> 00:30:12,425
- That's great news.
- Yeah, and then Pete took Betsey to see her mom,

554
00:30:12,492 --> 00:30:13,893
and Dell punched Pete.

555
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:15,361
We're one big happy family.

556
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:17,363
- Everything's bad now, I know...
- Stop talking.

557
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:20,132
- But you have to give me another chance.
- I said stop talking!

558
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:22,405
Just... I'm tired of talking

559
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:23,954
and I'm tired of thinking.

560
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:24,821
Could you just stop talking?

561
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:36,215
You gonna tell me what happened?

562
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:39,952
Addison.

563
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:47,893
Hey.

564
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:53,332
Talk to me.

565
00:30:55,969 --> 00:30:57,603
Tell me... tell me...

566
00:31:05,545 --> 00:31:07,847
- Wait, wait. Wait.
- Not like this.

567
00:31:07,914 --> 00:31:09,315
Not like this.

568
00:31:09,383 --> 00:31:10,483
Please.

569
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,917
Addison, no, no.

570
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:12,952
Sam...

571
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,754
No, no. No.

572
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,583
I'm sorry.

573
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:46,752
Shh.

574
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,254
Don't be sorry.

575
00:31:48,321 --> 00:31:50,823
I'm sorry.

576
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:53,859
It's okay.

577
00:31:58,603 --> 00:31:59,684
You people need to leave.

578
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,586
Leave this house. Leave
this city. Go home.

579
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:05,702
- Samuel, you have no right to interfere in this.
- It... it... it's okay.

580
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,270
No, it is not okay.

581
00:32:07,338 --> 00:32:09,406
Addison is over at my house right now,

582
00:32:09,473 --> 00:32:13,510
and I don't know what
happened, but you people did it.

583
00:32:13,577 --> 00:32:16,479
Sam. I don't think I've
seen you since you...

584
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:18,548
You were an awkward med student.

585
00:32:18,616 --> 00:32:21,284
All due respect, this isn't about you.

586
00:32:21,352 --> 00:32:22,952
No, it's about them.

587
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,954
It's their family.

588
00:32:25,022 --> 00:32:28,191
I'm sure you care about
Addison, but so do I, so do they.

589
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:31,528
They're not just gonna run out
because Addison is... is upset.

590
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:35,131
And I will not let... this destroy them.

591
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:36,733
Well, she's my family, too.

592
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:39,269
And I think I know her better right now.

593
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:41,938
So I'm not asking. I'm
telling you, you need to leave.

594
00:32:42,006 --> 00:32:44,207
Now if Addison wants
to make things right,

595
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:46,476
then that's up to her.

596
00:32:46,544 --> 00:32:48,645
- But you are not going to push her.
- Sam...

597
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:50,180
Look...

598
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:54,818
If you care about Addison,

599
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:57,620
and I believe that you do,

600
00:32:57,688 --> 00:33:00,023
leave.

601
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:02,926
Come back to bed, Coop.

602
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:04,894
I gotta get back to the hospital.

603
00:33:04,962 --> 00:33:07,097
You shouldn't be embarrassed.

604
00:33:07,164 --> 00:33:09,299
Things have been
really stressful lately.

605
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:10,767
Dell's family...

606
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:13,903
Oh, is it time for the sexology advice?

607
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:16,806
"Impotence happens to all
men. It's usually just stress.

608
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:19,776
- Maybe we can cuddle instead."
- Cooper...

609
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:22,178
You neglected to tell me
that you were married before.

610
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:24,581
- That's the problem.
- Cooper...

611
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:26,516
Oh, shut up, okay?

612
00:33:26,584 --> 00:33:28,651
Shut up.

613
00:33:35,326 --> 00:33:36,481
I hate you!

614
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:46,720
She's just upset right now.

615
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,885
Well, I'm upset, too,
okay? She hates me.

616
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:50,493
I'm... I'm not the one who
almost killed her, you know.

617
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:53,493
I'm tired, Violet. I'm exhausted.

618
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:56,927
- I'm just trying to protect her.
- And you are protecting her. I know that.

619
00:33:56,927 --> 00:33:59,349
You're protecting her from
seeing something horrible.

620
00:34:00,017 --> 00:34:03,185
But maybe you're protecting
her from the wrong things, Dell.

621
00:34:03,253 --> 00:34:06,022
I mean, my life is a
mess. You know that.

622
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:08,024
And... and you're...
 you're probably right.

623
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:10,126
I don't always make the best choices.

624
00:34:10,193 --> 00:34:14,296
But, um, you know, I've
always made them with, uh...

625
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,701
with Lucas...

626
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:21,637
with Lucas in mind, to protect him.

627
00:34:21,705 --> 00:34:24,540
And, you know, maybe
I'm right, but maybe...

628
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:27,676
I... I just know that if Heather
could, she would take away

629
00:34:27,744 --> 00:34:29,355
all the hurt that she
has caused you and Betsey,

630
00:34:29,355 --> 00:34:30,454
Every last bit of it, Dell.

631
00:34:33,383 --> 00:34:35,251
I found a pipe last night...

632
00:34:35,318 --> 00:34:38,521
Last night... and I
confronted her about it.

633
00:34:38,588 --> 00:34:41,490
And she said it wasn't hers,
that she had a friend over.

634
00:34:41,558 --> 00:34:42,691
You know, and I knew she was lying.

635
00:34:42,691 --> 00:34:43,608
I mean, I knew she was lying.

636
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:45,450
But I wanted and I needed

637
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,614
to believe that she wasn't using again,

638
00:34:47,614 --> 00:34:50,775
that she wouldn't do
that to me or to Betsey,

639
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:53,936
that she loved us enough to stay clean.

640
00:34:53,704 --> 00:34:57,740
So I walked out of the
house, and I left my daughter.

641
00:34:57,808 --> 00:35:01,043
I left Betsey.

642
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:04,013
And she must have been so
scared when it happened.

643
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:07,483
I did that to her... me. So
I can't let it happen again.

644
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:09,886
Hey...

645
00:35:09,953 --> 00:35:11,687
Dell

646
00:35:11,755 --> 00:35:14,123
Heather is going to die.

647
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:18,761
So you might want to allow
her a little bit of mercy.

648
00:35:20,164 --> 00:35:21,964
Just for one moment.

649
00:35:26,203 --> 00:35:28,337
Dell.

650
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:32,175
Dell.

651
00:35:35,846 --> 00:35:37,680
Dell, you came.

652
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:39,682
Heather, Dell is not here.

653
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,684
That's the morphine talking.

654
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:45,588
I'm sorry for lying to you.

655
00:35:45,656 --> 00:35:48,858
I'm sorry.

656
00:35:57,334 --> 00:35:59,635
I forgive you.

657
00:36:01,939 --> 00:36:04,473
I'm sorry for hurting you.

658
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:11,013
And I'm... sorry for
hurting our little girl.

659
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,984
Tell her...

660
00:36:15,052 --> 00:36:17,954
tell her that I love her so much.

661
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,926
Tell her that mommy made a mistake.

662
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:28,364
I love her so much.

663
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:31,534
Will you tell her, Dell?

664
00:36:31,602 --> 00:36:34,237
I'll tell her.

665
00:36:34,304 --> 00:36:37,206
I wanted to be a good mom.

666
00:36:37,274 --> 00:36:40,409
I wanted to.

667
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:45,848
I forgive you.

668
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,650
It's okay.

669
00:36:47,718 --> 00:36:50,820
I love you and I forgive you.

670
00:36:50,888 --> 00:36:53,389
And our baby's gonna
be okay. So don't worry.

671
00:36:58,395 --> 00:37:01,697
You just go ahead and go.

672
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:06,002
You can go ahead and go.

673
00:37:08,105 --> 00:37:10,106
Just go.

674
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:12,275
just go.

675
00:37:31,495 --> 00:37:33,496
Heather.

676
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,035
I'm sorry.

677
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:49,754
Addison.

678
00:37:55,561 --> 00:37:58,229
We're leaving, all of us.

679
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:00,598
Bizzy never meant to hurt you.

680
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:03,801
I tried to get her to
leave. I was the selfish one.

681
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:06,037
I wanted more.

682
00:38:06,104 --> 00:38:08,873
But she wouldn't leave her children.

683
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:11,008
That should count for something.

684
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:29,026
Heather died.

685
00:38:29,094 --> 00:38:31,796
So I'm going to the hospital.

686
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:34,791
Wait, Addison.

687
00:38:35,494 --> 00:38:36,230
I'm coming with you.

688
00:38:49,582 --> 00:38:51,983
Dell, I'm... I'm sorry.

689
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:55,920
I have to...

690
00:38:55,988 --> 00:38:58,756
Go in there and tell
her that Heather's...

691
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,361
Betsey's gonna want to know everything.

692
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:05,964
She's gonna ask me questions
about everything that happened.

693
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:09,067
What do I say?

694
00:39:15,774 --> 00:39:18,476
You tell her the truth.

695
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:23,414
As painful and horrible as
it is, you tell her the truth.

696
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:39,731
Hey.

697
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:43,935
Mommy didn't make it.

698
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:45,370
Is she...

699
00:39:45,437 --> 00:39:46,504
Yeah.

700
00:39:46,572 --> 00:39:47,672
No!

701
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,608
Come here. Come here. It's okay.

702
00:40:01,787 --> 00:40:06,124
I kept something from
you that I shouldn't have.

703
00:40:06,192 --> 00:40:07,759
I lied.

704
00:40:07,826 --> 00:40:10,528
And I lied because I didn't
want you looking at me

705
00:40:10,596 --> 00:40:12,530
the way you're looking at me now...

706
00:40:12,598 --> 00:40:15,166
the way you're not looking at me.

707
00:40:15,234 --> 00:40:17,969
I'm sorry.

708
00:40:18,037 --> 00:40:20,405
I'll keep saying it until it's enough,

709
00:40:20,472 --> 00:40:23,508
until you forgive me.

710
00:40:23,576 --> 00:40:25,009
Okay?

711
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:30,748
Heather's dead.

712
00:41:36,448 --> 00:41:39,517
Did you call wilson to complain

713
00:41:39,585 --> 00:41:42,387
about the service on your flight out?

714
00:41:42,454 --> 00:41:45,189
No.

715
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:49,917
I'll call. I can call, make some noise.

716
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:52,998
They won't wanna lose your business.

717
00:41:52,998 --> 00:41:55,406
That would be nice.

718
00:41:58,362 --> 00:41:59,413
Thank you.
