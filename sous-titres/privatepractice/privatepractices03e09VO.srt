1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,027
Eleonor Burgen. 23 weeks in the oby.
Noticed an abnormality with the baby.

2
00:00:07,027 --> 00:00:09,748
She's here today for a 3D
ultrasound, a follow-up.

3
00:00:10,655 --> 00:00:12,184
- Wow...
- I know.

4
00:00:12,184 --> 00:00:14,746
Others have built up a
cerebral spinal fluid...

5
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:19,523
Doctors split on what to do here. Some say wait as long
as possible to take the baby then clear once it's out

6
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:24,560
and possibly rupture
the mother's uterus.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,933
And that's the other camp,
they say deliver the baby now.

8
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:29,715
- Twenty three weeks is way too soon.
- Or terminate.

9
00:00:31,544 --> 00:00:33,285
Eleanor and her husband
didn't know what to do,

10
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:35,959
so they called me, and I
called you to break the tie.

11
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:39,703
- That's the husband.
- Hi, Ronald.

12
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:41,216
This is the doctor I
was telling you about.

13
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,343
Hi, Addison Montgomery.

14
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,272
Thank you so much for coming.

15
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:46,021
My wife and I a little freaked
a lot freaked, actually.

16
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:47,900
We look at the scan,
at the baby's head...

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,442
And she's in there praying that
you're not gonna tell us to give up.

18
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:52,766
Let's, uh, take a look
and we'll talk after, okay

19
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,727
this is my wife... Eleanor.

22
00:01:12,645 --> 00:01:15,228
- Well, maybe this is my penance for pushing.
- El.

23
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:18,305
I never thought I'd have
a child until I met Ron,

24
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:20,328
and then we just both thought, why not?

25
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:22,936
- Why not try for everything?
- So it was a year

26
00:01:22,936 --> 00:01:25,629
of looking for an egg
donor, three cycles of IVF.

27
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:31,096
Now look. Just look.
What were we thinking?

28
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:32,331
Congenital hydrocephalus

29
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:34,965
isn't necessarily correlated
with a mother's age.

30
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:38,519
- "Necessarily" being the operative word.
- It's a waste of time to feel guilty.

31
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,124
This is our baby. This is our chance.

32
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:42,260
If Eleanor were to stay
here and be monitored,

33
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,970
would it be safe for her to
continue with the pregnancy?

34
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,112
I wouldn't, but there
could be another option.

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,680
I might be able to do what's called

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,083
an in-utero intracranial septostomy.

37
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:52,785
Meaning I'd go in through the uterus

38
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:54,353
and into the baby's brain,

39
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:56,073
create a hole between the ventricles.

40
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:57,504
That would drain some of the fluid

41
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:01,223
- and relieve the pressure.
- Brain surgery while the baby's inside me?

42
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,121
Is that... safe?

43
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:06,828
He means, is it safe for a woman my age?

44
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:10,302
Maya.

45
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:13,078
I'm leaving now if you
want a ride to school.

46
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:14,452
I'll catch the bus.

47
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:16,981
All right. Sit near the emergency exit.

48
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:18,489
Love you. Bye.

49
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,145
Oh...

50
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:32,676
What the hell is that?

51
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:36,420
Um... clothes and makeup.

52
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,635
And you were just
gonna wait until I left

53
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:40,041
so you could go to
school dressed like that?

54
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,419
This is how all Girls dress.

55
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:43,365
Not this girl. You have five seconds

56
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:46,125
to get upstairs, wash your face
and put on something decent.

57
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,338
We'll discuss how long
you're grounded later.

58
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:50,170
You're ruining my life.

59
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:52,774
What did you say? Excuse
me. What did you say?

60
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:53,415
Nothing!

61
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:00,444
She's 60 years old, Addison.

62
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:02,637
The risks of major
surgery... stroke, arrhythmia,

63
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:04,490
getting her off the ventilator...
they're all much higher.

64
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,835
It's still the best option.

65
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:08,357
For the baby, maybe.
But not for Eleanor.

66
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:09,741
If we try to string this out

67
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:11,021
and bring it closer to viability,

68
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:13,979
it is not just the baby that
could be in trouble, Pete.

69
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:14,867
I mean, you saw the scan.

70
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,575
She's got, like, a little
time bomb in her uterus.

71
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:19,823
Then we should advise them
to terminate and try again.

72
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:20,899
And what are the odds of that happening?

73
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:22,573
They could use a surrogate or adopt.

74
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:25,104
You think somebody's gonna
give a 60-year-old woman a baby?

75
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,477
You think Eleanor's too old to a parent?

76
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:28,805
I think it's a little weird

77
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:31,639
to introduce your prom date
to your 80-year-old mother.

78
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,020
That's one of the downsides

79
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,696
of getting good at fertility treatment.

80
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:37,786
Everyone thinks they should
be able to have their own baby,

81
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:39,558
- even at 60.
- I don't know.

82
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:41,329
Maybe this child just
wasn't meant to be.

83
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:45,371
Not my b... not our... not Lucas.

84
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,464
A patient. She's 60 and pregnant.

85
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,864
Oh. Well, if she's happy
sending her husband out

86
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,042
for dentures and diapers,
then more power to her.

87
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:54,230
Yeah, well, the husband's 30.

88
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:56,301
Even more power to her.

89
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:59,229
Now wait a minute. When Pete
was dating younger woman,

90
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:01,532
- you said it was disgusting.
- Don't bring me into this.

91
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,547
No, I'm just pointing out that
Violet has a double standard.

92
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:06,650
There is a stigma attached
to dating older women,

93
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,353
so I figure if a guy does, he's
in it for the right reasons.

94
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,236
Oh, right. Lunch.

95
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:18,139
Uh... Pete, this is
my father, the captain.

96
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:19,297
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

97
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:21,984
And, uh, this is, uh...

98
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:27,952
Oh, hi. Sorry.

99
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:28,877
Not at all.

100
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,612
See? It is disgusting.

101
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,347
Come on, let's go.

102
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:42,007
- I almost killed your child today.
- Oh, so today she's my child.

103
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:44,136
No, you would've had to
bury her body in secret

104
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:46,436
- to keep me from going to jail.
- Okay, what'd she do?

105
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:47,852
She tried to sneak out of the house

106
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:51,770
dressed up like some
25-year-old I don't know what.

107
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,214
You remember when she used
to put on your lipstick...

108
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:58,337
- Sam, she's not 4, and this is not sweet.
- Oh, come on now, Nai.

109
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:00,665
Don't "nai" me. She was
trying to pull one over on me.

110
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:03,210
And then when I called
her on it, she stomped away

111
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,888
- and slammed the door, in my house.
- You said you almost killed her, right?

112
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:08,776
I am not gonna let
our daughter turn into

113
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,292
one of those snot-nosed
private school kids

114
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:12,290
who just thinks that they
can do whatever they want.

115
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,430
That is not Maya.

116
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,537
- Well, apparently, we don't know Maya.
- Well, try not to get yourself all worked up.

117
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:18,485
Sam, she is hiding things from me,

118
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:20,390
which means she doesn't trust me

119
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,803
or she is doing something
that she knows is wrong.

120
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:25,107
And you think this is more than her

121
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:27,312
- just putting on some skimpy clothes?
- I don't know.

122
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:30,010
I don't know, but I'm gonna
turn her room upside down

123
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,598
until I figure out
exactly what's going on.

124
00:05:34,998 --> 00:05:36,824
Well, uh, Ruthie looks
fine. How are you doing?

125
00:05:36,824 --> 00:05:39,842
- Great.
- Yeah, you got these two little ones

126
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:42,223
and 4 others at home under, what, 8,

127
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:44,761
- and you're... you're great, huh?
- I'm very blessed.

128
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,823
Doesn't mean you can't complain.

129
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:48,853
- Tell me you're exhausted.
- Oh, I gave up on sleep a long time ago.

130
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,071
I mean, you got no
time to yourself or...

131
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,243
It's, uh, Shimmon.

132
00:05:57,243 --> 00:05:59,981
- Yeah, it's your husband?
- He's not...

133
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:02,451
interested.

134
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:07,041
Oh, uh, okay. Well,
that, uh, that happens.

135
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,041
Some men feel awkward with their wives

136
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:11,476
during or sometimes even
after pregnancy, but it passes.

137
00:06:11,544 --> 00:06:14,446
Dr. Freedman, I shouldn't
be talking to you about this.

138
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:16,782
- It's not proper.
- If there's a problem...

139
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:19,785
It's not proper, and, uh,
I don't think you can help.

140
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:24,073
I need your help.

141
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:26,292
If you knew somebody was admiring you,

142
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,992
specifically your ass,

143
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:30,334
would that just be flattering,

144
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:32,239
or would that get you aroused?

145
00:06:33,057 --> 00:06:35,822
'Cause I think that
would be arousing, right?

146
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:38,161
- Yeah.
- To know that somebody right near you

147
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:39,506
is thinking about you sexually?

148
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:40,875
Wait, who are we
talking about, me or you?

149
00:06:42,121 --> 00:06:43,675
W... we're talking
about y... you, right?

150
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:45,561
You asked me to help you with something?

151
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:47,293
Oh, yeah. Um, a patient.

152
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:50,715
Two months postpartum,
and she's concerned

153
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:52,984
'cause her husband is
not interested in sex.

154
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:55,019
Oh, well, could be depression, stress,

155
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:55,884
performance anxiety.

156
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:58,289
Unless it's vascular
disease, hyperthyroidism,

157
00:06:58,357 --> 00:06:59,824
iatrogenic impotence.

158
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:01,155
Forget where my office is, Coop,

159
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,537
the one with all the marital aids

160
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:05,427
- and books you sneak in to look at during lunch?
- No, I was just...

161
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:07,729
Referring a patient to Violet
you should be referring to me

162
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:13,413
because you're still mad and petty. Pettiness
aside, there's no reason to jump to physiology.

163
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:15,349
I mean, sex issues, more often than not,

164
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:16,837
are rooted in emotional dysfunctions.

165
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,755
Yes. Actually, we're
finding more and more

166
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:21,052
that problems in the bedroom
stem from hormonal imbalances,

167
00:07:21,052 --> 00:07:23,719
nerve problems, all kinds
of equipment failure.

168
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:26,594
Ok, you know what? I would
like to see her alone first.

169
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:28,983
I thought we were one
big team here at OWG.

170
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:31,175
Or is that only when you want
in on other people's patients?

171
00:07:41,205 --> 00:07:42,977
So how exactly do you see this working?

172
00:07:42,977 --> 00:07:46,172
Having an awkward lunch
together every few days

173
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:49,021
that it takes you three
vodka tonics to get through

174
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:51,194
and me a half a bottle of
wine at night to forget?

175
00:07:51,194 --> 00:07:51,873
Addison, please.

176
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,919
I enjoyed seeing your office.

177
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,262
Violet's ass or the whole thing?

178
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:02,471
I'd like to see your house.

179
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:05,235
So we could sit there
and stare at each other,

180
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,158
see who blinks first
without even a waiter

181
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:08,250
to break the tension?

182
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:10,396
No.

183
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:14,565
You working on anything interesting?

184
00:08:15,604 --> 00:08:16,275
I'm just...

185
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:18,278
I'm trying, Addison.

186
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,243
I might be doing an in-utero
intracranial septostomy.

187
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,681
Really?

188
00:08:30,983 --> 00:08:32,850
Trick there is getting a good angle

189
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:35,053
on the foramen of monro.

190
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,421
Right.

191
00:08:36,488 --> 00:08:39,223
And then finding the
avascular plane of the septum.

192
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,659
Yes. Yeah.

193
00:08:44,697 --> 00:08:46,014
So would you go

194
00:08:46,014 --> 00:08:48,237
to the contralateral ventricle first?

195
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:57,601
Mom. What are you doing home?

196
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:05,679
I don't know who you are...

197
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:09,408
But you should leave.

198
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:12,657
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:19,119
Mom?

200
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:20,632
Don't...

201
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:23,501
Talk.

202
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:24,969
One...

203
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:26,070
Two...

204
00:09:26,138 --> 00:09:28,072
Mom, what are you gonna do?

205
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,074
Three... four...

206
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:32,110
Mom, why are you counting?

207
00:09:32,177 --> 00:09:33,378
Five...

208
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:35,780
I am trying to calm myself down.

209
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:37,515
Six...

210
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,683
Seven...

211
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:40,685
- It's not working.
- Mom...

212
00:09:40,753 --> 00:09:42,220
Call your father.

213
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:45,046
Tell him to come here
now and save your life.

214
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:49,228
It's not the first time
Shimmon hasn't been interested

215
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:52,443
after we've had a baby, but
it's lasting longer this time.

216
00:09:52,443 --> 00:09:53,866
And I started thinking...

217
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:56,502
- Does your husband f...
- How often do you and your husband...

218
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:02,206
Okay, well, other than
the lack of interest,

219
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:05,009
have you noticed anything else
different about your husband?

220
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:06,534
Well, like what? Is
he emotionally distant?

221
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:08,686
Not at all. Shimmon's wonderful.

222
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:11,943
- Oh. Oh, good.
- Well, have you noticed...

223
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:14,815
- Any physical changes?
- Well, he hasn't been sleeping well,

224
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:18,077
so he's always up poking around
the fridge with weird cravings.

225
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:20,437
And, well, maybe I'm imagining it,

226
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:22,613
- but up here...
- Getting a little flabby?

227
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,631
- It's the couvade.
- What's that?

228
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:27,399
Well, sometimes a woman's pregnancy

229
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,401
causes changes in her
partner's hormones.

230
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:31,403
His testosterone gets
converted to oestrogen.

231
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:34,072
It's a sympathetic reaction,
so his symptoms mimic yours.

232
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,478
- But it's easily treatable...
- Cognitive behavioral therapy...

233
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:38,845
Androgen supplementation.

234
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:42,138
Either way, we can help you get
Shimmon charged right back up.

235
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:44,185
I'm sorry. Maybe I'm not being clear.

236
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,370
That's not what I want
at all. I love my husband.

237
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,233
I love being intimate with him.

238
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,811
But I can't have him charged back up.

239
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:55,785
I thought you wanted
help with your sex life.

240
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:58,767
We have six kids who I adore.

241
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,259
But if I have to raise

242
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,334
or Shimmon has to
provide for any more...

243
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:06,115
We can't use birth control,

244
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:08,559
but we can't have more kids.

245
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,506
So this couvade,

246
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:14,140
is there any way to keep
it going permanently?

247
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:18,448
She wants you to keep him tam

248
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:20,819
- and you're okay with that?
- Well, people have

249
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:22,757
meaningful relationships
without hang sex.

250
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:24,769
And yet, when they're not having it,

251
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:26,915
it's usually a sign that
there's a problem, isn't it?

252
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:29,880
- You asked me to help, Cooper.
- No, actually, I asked Violet to help.

253
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,074
And I don't think that
what Rachel needs right now

254
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:32,880
is for you to bring her back in

255
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,854
and start tossing around
words like "oral" and "anal."

256
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:37,209
Well, personally, I don't think
Rachel needs to give up sex at all.

257
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:39,070
I mean, why should a woman

258
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,671
who's feeling something not act on it?

259
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,672
No matter how deeply she
tries to bury her feelings,

260
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:46,204
eventually, they're
gonna come back, right?

261
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:50,319
I think we need to
convince her that it's okay

262
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:53,075
- to use birth control.
- Well, I agree, but I don't think she's going there.

263
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:55,913
I think we're missing a
major part of this equation.

264
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:58,890
Sex... guy involved.

265
00:11:59,091 --> 00:12:01,155
- Or at least there's supposed to be.
- You know, he's right.

266
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,508
- We should get Shimmon to help.
- But if Rachel won't talk to a man,

267
00:12:03,508 --> 00:12:04,706
would Shimmon talk to a woman?

268
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:12,114
Well, then even if the
buildup of CSF is significant,

269
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:15,462
- you can still get complete resolution.
- Ideally, yes.

270
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:17,509
Uh...

271
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:19,530
-So...
-I have a patient,

272
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,142
and, um, then I have to go
to the hospital after that.

273
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,659
So thank you for lunch.

274
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,051
Okay.

275
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:32,804
Oh, hello.

276
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,887
Dr. Montgomery.

277
00:12:35,976 --> 00:12:37,186
W... captain.

278
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:42,663
Captain.

279
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:47,025
She was here

280
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:50,960
- ditching school on her back with some boy.
- His name is Dink.

281
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:53,861
- You told me that you two were just friends.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

282
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:56,356
What, what, you... you
knew about this Dink?

283
00:12:56,356 --> 00:12:59,379
Uh, not... not much. I-I
know that she likes him

284
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,893
and that he's in the band.

285
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:05,366
He's in a you told
me he was in the band.

286
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:08,734
- You two aren't...
- Having sex?

287
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:11,991
- No!
- So you say. How are we supposed to trust you, Maya,

288
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,022
when you go and you
do something like this

289
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:15,501
and you show such poor judgment?

290
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:19,487
- So having a boyfriend counts as poor judgment?
- Yes. Did I say you could have a boyfriend?

291
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:20,967
Did I say you could talk to boys?

292
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,851
- Did I say you could even be around a boy?
- Okay, l... calm down.

293
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:27,134
- All right, let's just try to discuss this rationally.
- That's fine with me.

294
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:29,746
Mom is the one that's
getting all worked up.

295
00:13:29,746 --> 00:13:30,223
Maya.

296
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:33,002
Maybe if you had a boyfriend...

297
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:37,507
- What? I will... I... I will kill this child, Sam.
- Don't... no, she...

298
00:13:37,507 --> 00:13:39,090
You... you better go
upstairs and pack a bag.

299
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,177
- What?
- Go upstairs and pack a bag... now.

300
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:51,369
Okay, don't worry.

301
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:53,087
All right? I... I got this.

302
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,051
Um, I'll bring her over to
my house for a couple of days.

303
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:58,352
You've been doing all the
parenting. It's my turn.

304
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:00,571
Thank you. I... I... I got this.

305
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:01,911
Yeah, you better have it, Sam.

306
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:04,008
This is our child.

307
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:09,087
- What's bradycardia?
- It means that the baby's heart rate has slowed down.

308
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:11,155
Nobody said anything about the heart.

309
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:14,125
It's a side effect of
increased cranial pressure.

310
00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:16,294
How dangerous is it?

311
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:28,273
Your baby isn't going
to make it to viability.

312
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,376
We either need to perform the septostomy

313
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:34,012
or terminate the pregnancy.

314
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,214
I'm sorry.

315
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:38,883
I'm worried about you.

316
00:14:40,386 --> 00:14:42,754
Let's just worry about the baby.

317
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:46,324
How soon can you operate?

318
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:51,062
I should do this more often.

319
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:57,936
Anytime.

320
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:07,412
Mm. I'm sorry.

321
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:10,397
- I can't. I can't.
- You don't need to say anything.

322
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:12,660
It's just been a long time,
you know, since I felt this way.

323
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,378
You know, I've been stuck
in my head for so long,

324
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:18,322
the idea that I have a body,
that I could be touched...

325
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,365
Do you mind my scar?

326
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:24,960
Not at all.

327
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:28,592
I can't look at it.

328
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:33,171
Then don't.

329
00:15:33,238 --> 00:15:35,406
It'll fade.

330
00:15:35,474 --> 00:15:36,975
And in the meantime,

331
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:40,545
let e a reminder that...

332
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:44,649
You went through something
no one else quite understands

333
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:47,352
and survived...

334
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,654
And that you... you earned the right

335
00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:52,590
to do exactly what you want for a while,

336
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:56,894
whether it's this or... anything else.

337
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:07,438
I'm afraid Addison's gonna hate me.

338
00:16:07,506 --> 00:16:10,041
You'll be in good company.

339
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:13,077
Do you think there's any way

340
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:15,213
to explain it to her
that she'd understand?

341
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,148
Emotional discussions are not our forte,

342
00:16:17,216 --> 00:16:18,983
so I don't know.

343
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:21,119
That'sad.

344
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:23,688
It is.

345
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:26,591
I was always... working, traveling

346
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:31,429
when Addison had this or that going on.

347
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:34,732
No one event I missed looms large,

348
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,003
but in the aggregate, I suppose I...

349
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:40,838
lost track of her,

350
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:42,807
of who she is anyway.

351
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,109
But you're here now trying.

352
00:16:45,177 --> 00:16:48,413
I guess I should just try harder.

353
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,516
Well, ybe if you saw her more here...

354
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,385
In her element...

355
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:57,488
That might make it easier.

356
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:59,991
It might be good for both of you.

357
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:14,475
Maya's being stupid.

358
00:17:14,475 --> 00:17:16,753
- Well, she's a teenager.
- If you take her side in this,

359
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,151
- I swear, I will take my chocolate and I will leave.
- I am not.

360
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:22,063
I am on your side, Nai...
for what it's worth.

361
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:24,709
I mean, honestly, you'd be
hard-pressed to find someone

362
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,612
who knows less about functional
parent-child relationships.

363
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,215
What, is the captain that bad? He
says heants to spend time with me,

364
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,317
but he doesn't know how
to spend time with me.

365
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,919
We talked about surgery.
He lectures, and I pretend

366
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,056
to not already know
what he's telling me.

367
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,992
I should just send him home,
let him and Bizzy clank around

368
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,495
in that empty house in wasp-y silence.

369
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,463
Yeah, well, sitting
around in your empty house,

370
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,533
you start to have doubts.

371
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,369
Will you please tell me that
I am doing the right thing?

372
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,772
You are doing the right thing, Nai.

373
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,176
I don't mean to disturb you.

374
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,345
- Naomi.
- Captain, how are you?

375
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,247
I came to ask a favor.

376
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:05,183
I was hoping I could observe you

377
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,218
perform the septostomy.

378
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,388
You want to watch...

379
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,358
Me? I've never seen you work.

380
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,694
I know your reputation,
of course, but, uh...

381
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,863
I'd like to see it, to see... you.

382
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,199
Okay.

383
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,368
If it's not an imposition...

384
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,737
Just take yes as an answer.

385
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,042
Look, I work two jobs six days a week,

386
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,111
and Rachel is consumed.

387
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,113
She makes our home,

388
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,982
she juggles schools and doctors
and meals and birthdays...

389
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,652
So many things, I lose track.

390
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,789
Exactly, so at a certain point,
whether it's 7 or 9 or 12 kids,

391
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,058
do you think you'll want to stop?

392
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,727
The torah tells us "to
be fruitful and multiply,"

393
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,197
fill the earth and subdue it.

394
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,899
We interpret that to mean
that we can't do anything

395
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,702
to try to prevent a pregnancy.

396
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,672
I love my wife.

397
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,976
And neither one of us wants
to give up... you know...

398
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,911
What if we could find something

399
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,848
that wasn't technically birth control?

400
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,482
Uh...

401
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,085
We have chosen to be
faithful, Dr. Freedman.

402
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,854
Who would we be fooling?

403
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,395
People are unpredictable.

404
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,332
- Look, Addison...
- Just when you think you know someone,

405
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,268
- they go ahead and do something nice.
- Wait, what?

406
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,071
My father. He wants
to watch me do surgery.

407
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,807
I mean, the man never made
a single piano recital,

408
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,576
tennis match... nothing my whole life.

409
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,678
- And suddenly...
- That's... that's great.

410
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,115
Violet, look, I know that
you think people can change,

411
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,218
but do you really think the captain...

412
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,456
Hey, Pete.

413
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,157
Yeah, of course.

414
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,127
- I'll be right
down. - Uh-huh. Okay.

415
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,801
What's wrong with you?

416
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,204
Nothing. Nothing is wrong with me.

417
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,840
I'm normal. I just... I
just did something normal.

418
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,675
Congratulations.

419
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,111
No, really. I, um...

420
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,647
I slept with someone.

421
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,516
I didn't think I would, but then I did.

422
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:22,720
And it was... normal. I didn't
even think I cared anymore,

423
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,456
but then I slept with
the captain, and it was

424
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,425
the most normal thing
I've done since the attack.

425
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:30,528
Did I just say his name out
loud? Because I was thinking it,

426
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,731
- and then I just... yeah, I said it out loud.
- So all that about getting your needs met...

427
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,667
No, no, no. This was not about sex.

428
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,403
It was... it was good.

429
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,038
Except for the part

430
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,473
where you committed adultery
with your friend's father.

431
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,377
We need a rabbi.

432
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,748
She's 15 years old, all right?
She's becoming her own person.

433
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,617
We gotta give her room.

434
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,552
Room to what, roll around on the couch

435
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,154
with some boy named Dink?

436
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,156
Well, maybe we should
meet him, you know,

437
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,625
- see what kind of a guy he is.
- He's the kind of guy

438
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,294
- who had his hands all over your daughter's...
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.

439
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,130
Hey, do you remember what you
were like when you were his age?

440
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,133
Oh, yeah, well, you're...
you're not a good example,

441
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,702
but this Dink person,

442
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,804
he looks like a scruffy little hormone.

443
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,540
Okay, I will talk to her about him.

444
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,375
Talking's good, but yelling's fine, too.

445
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,477
She's gotta feel like she can trust us.

446
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:22,046
She needs to know that
she cannot cross us.

447
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,982
We've gotta hold the line, Sam.

448
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,351
Tough but fair.

449
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,253
All right, well, when in doubt, you...

450
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,889
Channel me.

451
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,759
That's worked out well.

452
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,863
You need to talk her out
of it, Dr. Montgomery.

453
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:42,333
I know what we said,
but... when I look at you

454
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,736
and I think about what
they're about to do...

455
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,471
We don't have to do this.

456
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:50,141
If you want to save the baby,
Eleanor has to have surgery.

457
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:53,578
I'm scared, too, Ronnie.

458
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,013
But this our baby.

459
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,349
Okay, maybe it's not my
egg, but it's got your DNA.

460
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,551
Honey, it's your child.

461
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,587
It's not that I don't love it. I do.

462
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,589
But ght now...

463
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,026
I love you more.

464
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,994
I can't even think about losing you.

465
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,797
But you will.

466
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,932
We're never gonna have the kind of time

467
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,301
that other couples have together.

468
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,205
And after I'm gone,
you're gonna have this...

469
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,608
to remember what we had

470
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,511
and what we were together.

471
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,980
Look, I get that you want
what's best for Eleanor,

472
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,749
but if you do what's best for the baby,

473
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,585
I think I can give you both.

474
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:38,056
Ronnie, please.

475
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,827
Okay.

476
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,262
Okay.

477
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,574
Violet slept with Addison's father.

478
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:59,210
She...

479
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:01,479
I thought you'd want to know.

480
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,414
Why would she do that?

481
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,949
Why would she tell you?

482
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,884
Some people can talk to me.

483
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,320
Oh.

484
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,391
I'm trying to tell you
things, like you wanted.

485
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,726
Gossiping about who's sleeping with whom

486
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,596
is not want I wanted.

487
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:21,699
Where are we, Cooper,

488
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,868
you and me?

489
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,406
I don't know.

490
00:23:35,143 --> 00:23:36,410
Okay, hold on, baby.

491
00:23:37,578 --> 00:23:39,312
Sit still.

492
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:41,155
I wish she could give
the baby a paralytic

493
00:23:41,155 --> 00:23:42,376
to slow everything down.

494
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:44,257
Can't because of Eleanor's age.

495
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,434
Well, you could. I would.

496
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:49,795
I've learned... don't second guess her.

497
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,371
Well, I... I didn't mean
to, but that's not you.

498
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:54,097
You're... you're being protective.

499
00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:56,405
I can only imagine what
she's said about me.

500
00:23:56,405 --> 00:23:57,838
She hasn't,

501
00:23:57,838 --> 00:23:59,386
not much anyway.

502
00:24:01,246 --> 00:24:03,109
Are you two... close?

503
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,215
We are.

504
00:24:04,215 --> 00:24:07,131
Um, not like that. I'm with Violet.

505
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:09,681
Well, I was with Vi... well...

506
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:12,739
We recently had a baby
together, so we're...

507
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,825
Well, I don't know what we are.

508
00:24:14,825 --> 00:24:17,661
- Well...
- Okay, I'm in at...

509
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,716
2 millimeters.

510
00:24:19,716 --> 00:24:22,482
Get ready to inflate.

511
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:26,287
Okay, go.

512
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:28,558
You ever seen Addison

513
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:29,493
do surgery before?

514
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:31,287
Not since she was a kid.

515
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:35,025
Uh, when she was 8 or 9,

516
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:36,912
she used to love to come
to the university with me.

517
00:24:36,912 --> 00:24:39,238
She'd sit in the back of my
class cutting on a hot dog

518
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:42,286
while my other students
worked on their cadavers.

519
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:47,762
- She always wanted to impress me.
- With a hot dog?

520
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:50,583
You ever try to take the
casing off in one piece?

521
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,229
It's like separating

522
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,861
the dura from the cerebral cortex.

523
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:56,368
She's gotten good at it,

524
00:24:56,368 --> 00:24:57,703
clearly.

525
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:00,632
Damn it.

526
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,041
The opening's closing up.

527
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:07,411
Stay and visualize... then reinflate.

528
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:08,081
Come on, Addie.

529
00:25:09,196 --> 00:25:10,076
She will.

530
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:12,901
Okay, repositioning.

531
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:15,966
Come on.

532
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:21,840
Okay. We're back in at
the original incision.

533
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,082
Inflate the balloon to 3 millimeters...

534
00:25:25,468 --> 00:25:26,030
Now.

535
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:28,054
Come on.

536
00:25:29,189 --> 00:25:30,256
Hold.

537
00:25:30,324 --> 00:25:33,426
Hold.

538
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:35,461
Good.

539
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:37,663
Got it. Camera.

540
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:40,333
She's got it.

541
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,134
She's good.

542
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:44,971
Okay, let's prepare to close.

543
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:50,109
It's a mitzvah, guys.

544
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:52,049
Married people are
supposed to be having sex.

545
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:53,602
Whether or not they're
trying to have kids?

546
00:25:53,602 --> 00:25:56,922
Absolutely. Judaism is unique
among the major world religions

547
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,433
in that it promotes sex
not just for procreation

548
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:00,799
but for pleasure.

549
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,220
You see? You should
come to shul more often.

550
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,961
You'd learn all sorts of good things.

551
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:07,288
That's good. Sex is good.

552
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:10,611
But even if people are just
having sex for pleasure,

553
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,439
- babies happen.
- And you want to know about birth control.

554
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,325
You should read the story of onan.

555
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,819
We're pretty down on
anything that has to do with

556
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:21,080
- destruction of the seed.
- Well, the pill doesn't technically destroy any seed.

557
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,266
You're right. It... it's
all about interpretation.

558
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,970
Depending upon how observant
they are, some Jews feel

559
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,667
that if you've had at
least one boy and one girl,

560
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:30,976
you've been fruitful enough.

561
00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:32,705
Others take a harder line.

562
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:35,469
So with the hard-liners, is
there any kind of loophole?

563
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,208
Isn't there a mercy clause in Judaism

564
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:39,046
for parents who have
already filled up the minivan

565
00:26:39,046 --> 00:26:41,793
but still want to keep doing
those... those mitzvahs?

566
00:26:41,793 --> 00:26:44,450
Look, rabbis have been
debating these rules

567
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,456
- for hundred of years.
- So can't we find one who would let 'em use birth control?

568
00:26:47,456 --> 00:26:50,279
Sure, but it doesn't
sound like your patients

569
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,408
are looking to end-run the lord.

570
00:26:52,408 --> 00:26:53,692
They sound like they want to live

571
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:54,697
by the letter of the law.

572
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,325
Congratulations.

573
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:05,413
Thank you.

574
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:08,582
Your work is... elegant.

575
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:11,794
I was glad to be here.

576
00:27:12,254 --> 00:27:13,726
I was glad you were.

577
00:27:16,252 --> 00:27:17,152
Look, if, um...

578
00:27:18,198 --> 00:27:20,933
If you still want to see my house,

579
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:23,236
I mean, you could come
over tonight for a drink...

580
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,107
Uh, sure.

581
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,448
I love hanging out with you.

582
00:27:35,515 --> 00:27:37,416
And I love rainbow sprinkles.

583
00:27:37,484 --> 00:27:39,752
But are you gonna pick me
up from school every day?

584
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,122
- You can trust me, you know.
- I want to. I really do, but...

585
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,491
I know, the Dink thing wasn't good.

586
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,760
I should've just told mom about him.

587
00:27:47,828 --> 00:27:49,528
But she's so judgmental.

588
00:27:49,596 --> 00:27:51,831
Hey. She's supposed to be.

589
00:27:51,898 --> 00:27:53,499
We both are.

590
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:55,768
I think you'd really like him.

591
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:58,771
Dink is... amazing.

592
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,239
Amazing, huh?

593
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:04,477
All right, I think I
should meet him then.

594
00:28:04,544 --> 00:28:06,445
You totally should.
He'll think you're cool.

595
00:28:06,513 --> 00:28:08,948
- All my friends do.
- Really?

596
00:28:09,016 --> 00:28:10,283
Yeah.

597
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,852
Yeah.

598
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:15,955
Okay, so let's make a deal.

599
00:28:16,023 --> 00:28:20,893
Uh, you tell me everything
you do, with whom and where,

600
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:24,764
and I will treat you like
you know right from wrong.

601
00:28:24,831 --> 00:28:26,232
Okay.

602
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,234
Okay? All right.

603
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:31,752
I'm excited about this, living with you.

604
00:28:32,201 --> 00:28:33,565
- Aren't you?
- I am. Mm-hmm.

605
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:38,044
Go ahead. You can get that.

606
00:28:41,783 --> 00:28:44,310
What, is that your, uh, your B.F.F.

607
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,826
making you L.O.L.? Right?

608
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:48,586
Daddy, please don't do that.

609
00:28:54,686 --> 00:28:57,905
So... he came and watched my surgery.

610
00:28:57,905 --> 00:29:00,490
You know, I was afraid he
was gonna do something awful,

611
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,029
like make some big speech

612
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:03,795
about upholding the Montgomery name

613
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:05,986
or some snarky postmortem,

614
00:29:05,986 --> 00:29:07,739
but... he didn't.

615
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:10,317
He called it elegant.

616
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:12,991
It was nice.

617
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:16,691
- What?
- Oh, boy.

618
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:19,196
- What?
- Don't hate me, Addie.

619
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:22,331
I am your friend.

620
00:29:22,331 --> 00:29:24,146
I am your friend who
slept with your brother

621
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:26,687
and didn't tell you, and I
know what that did to you,

622
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:30,224
and I want to be your
friend and I don't want

623
00:29:30,224 --> 00:29:32,830
- to keep secrets from you...
- Oh, my God, Nai. You slept with the captain.

624
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,370
- No, no, Addie. No, I wouldn't.
- Oh, okay. Thank God.

625
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:39,557
Okay, for a minute, you scared me there.

626
00:29:39,557 --> 00:29:41,161
- I thought...
- Violet slept with him.

627
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,222
And... and Violet told Charlotte,

628
00:29:45,137 --> 00:29:46,406
and Charlotte told Cooper,

629
00:29:46,406 --> 00:29:48,381
and then Sam read it
all over Cooper's face,

630
00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:50,109
and then he didn't know
if you wanted to know,

631
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:54,802
so he asked me, and
I... I'm sorry, Addie.

632
00:29:56,257 --> 00:29:57,681
I couldn't not tell you.

633
00:30:05,476 --> 00:30:08,315
You need to just let it go,
Addie. Okay? It's not about you.

634
00:30:08,315 --> 00:30:09,729
Hey. You look wiped.

635
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:11,624
You should go home and pour
yourself a glass of wine.

636
00:30:11,624 --> 00:30:15,686
- Yeah, well, a glass of wine's not going to help.
- Yeah, Pete's right, Addie.

637
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:17,443
You should... you should go.

638
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:20,327
Yeah.

639
00:30:22,971 --> 00:30:24,109
Is it Eleanor?

640
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:30,226
She's having these stomach pains.

641
00:30:30,226 --> 00:30:31,906
- Her sats are dropping.
- What's wrong?

642
00:30:31,906 --> 00:30:33,623
Let's take a look here.

643
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:35,531
What's happening to her?

644
00:30:37,426 --> 00:30:40,293
- Free fluid in her abdomen.
- The uterus is almost empty.

645
00:30:40,293 --> 00:30:42,450
There's leaking around
the site of the incision.

646
00:30:43,101 --> 00:30:45,155
The baby's in distress. Okay, Eleanor.

647
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:46,791
We need to go back in
and repair the defect

648
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:50,076
and then we will infuse
fluid back into your uterus.

649
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:52,725
- Please... save the baby.
- Let's go.

650
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:54,188
Save them both.

651
00:30:58,128 --> 00:31:00,484
Focus on the uterine incision.
We need to localize the leak.

652
00:31:00,854 --> 00:31:02,987
Tissue's not as resilient as
it was when she was younger.

653
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,589
- Couldn't hold the seal.
- Okay, grab the suction irrigator.

654
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:12,169
Her respiratory rate is up and
her sats are dropping again.

655
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:14,066
- She's going into failure.
- She's fluid overloaded.

656
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:16,058
We need to get the amniotic
fluid out of her belly.

657
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,691
500 cc's.

658
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:20,531
Okay, we need to stabilize
her cardiac function.

659
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:22,986
Give her 40 of lasixs. I
need to get a patch in now.

660
00:31:27,103 --> 00:31:27,565
Foam?

661
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:28,969
Blocks sperm.

662
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:30,992
I.U.D.? If they ever do
want to have kids again,

663
00:31:30,992 --> 00:31:34,039
- it wouldn't be my first choice.
- How does the female condom work exactly?

664
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:38,176
- Cooper.
- No, really. It's like a big, flappy, messy mystery.

665
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:40,755
We have to be able to
find something here.

666
00:31:40,755 --> 00:31:42,881
We can't just preach abstinence.

667
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:45,588
What?

668
00:31:45,976 --> 00:31:48,174
It's just like... you're
just, like, all about the sex,

669
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:50,780
- just, like, with whomever, whenever...
- Cooper.

670
00:31:50,848 --> 00:31:52,515
Whatever the age difference.

671
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:55,218
I mean, how long do I have to pretend

672
00:31:55,285 --> 00:31:57,204
that I don't know that you
slept with Addison's father?

673
00:31:57,204 --> 00:31:58,412
Look, I'm happy about this.

674
00:31:58,412 --> 00:32:01,189
- I think it was... I think it was really good for me.
- That's good.

675
00:32:01,189 --> 00:32:04,235
Good for you. But, you
know, telling people things,

676
00:32:04,243 --> 00:32:05,913
telling the truth, it's important.

677
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:07,162
And that's a lesson

678
00:32:07,162 --> 00:32:08,438
that the women in this room could learn.

679
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:10,177
Are you done with your lecture?

680
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:13,249
- 'Cause it's not getting us anywhere with the Golds.
- Yeah, it really should not be this hard.

681
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:16,516
Well, it's not. It's the one
time we have a magic pill.

682
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,453
Doesn't take a genius to pop
one of these every morning.

683
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:22,504
Salt, water,
little bit of oestrogen...

684
00:32:22,504 --> 00:32:24,059
If it didn't say "birth
control" on the side,

685
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:25,932
the Gold would be fine with it.

686
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:31,811
I think we should ask
them to come back in.

687
00:32:36,711 --> 00:32:37,172
Ronnie.

688
00:32:38,684 --> 00:32:39,628
You're okay, El.

689
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:40,559
Oh.

690
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,496
You're okay.

691
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:45,566
Would you like to see your baby?

692
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:50,423
The head...

693
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:52,833
it's perfect.

694
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,611
I can't believe I almost...

695
00:32:58,418 --> 00:33:00,041
- I almost took this away from us.
- But you didn't.

696
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:03,254
When things got hard,
you acted like a father.

697
00:33:07,377 --> 00:33:08,782
- Addison?
- I gotta go.

698
00:33:10,273 --> 00:33:10,940
Excuse me.

699
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:13,159
Addison, hey.

700
00:33:15,483 --> 00:33:16,261
You want to talk about it?

701
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,203
No.

702
00:33:18,557 --> 00:33:20,369
Yes and no.

703
00:33:24,413 --> 00:33:26,089
My father slept with Violet.

704
00:33:28,504 --> 00:33:34,278
I know.

705
00:33:52,902 --> 00:33:53,541
Maya.

706
00:33:55,913 --> 00:33:58,998
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, I got this from your fridge, doc.

707
00:33:58,998 --> 00:34:00,028
Hope you don't mind.

708
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:02,942
Hi, Dr. Bennett. I'm Dink...

709
00:34:02,942 --> 00:34:05,660
- I know who you are.
- You said you wanted to meet him.

710
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,523
Get out of my house.

711
00:34:07,995 --> 00:34:10,336
- Go upstairs and put on some clothes.
- Daddy...

712
00:34:10,336 --> 00:34:11,566
Get your behind upstairs.

713
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:15,918
Okay, everybody, this party's
over. Don't bother cleaning up.

714
00:34:16,134 --> 00:34:18,335
- Daddy, can I just exp...
- This party is over!

715
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:48,104
Do you want me to explain?

716
00:34:49,695 --> 00:34:50,115
No.

717
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:59,534
I think things happen
for a reason, Pete.

718
00:34:59,602 --> 00:35:02,003
And sometimes you don't see them coming.

719
00:35:02,071 --> 00:35:05,340
Sometimes you don't
think they could come.

720
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:06,841
But they do.

721
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:10,211
And I hope you're not upset, because...

722
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:12,080
I'm not ashamed.

723
00:35:12,147 --> 00:35:14,182
I'm hopeful, actually, and...

724
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,417
Stop talking, Violet.

725
00:35:16,485 --> 00:35:19,287
You're talking as if I
care, as if it concerns me.

726
00:35:19,355 --> 00:35:21,456
But what you do... I don't care anymore.

727
00:35:21,524 --> 00:35:23,658
I'm done.

728
00:35:30,132 --> 00:35:34,869
We have all sorts of ways to
help you... devices, counseling...

729
00:35:34,937 --> 00:35:37,572
if and when you decide
to avail yourselves of it.

730
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,441
But ultimately, this
isn't a medical decision.

731
00:35:40,509 --> 00:35:43,511
It's a personal one.

732
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:46,548
So that's it?

733
00:35:47,983 --> 00:35:50,184
Shayna.

734
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:57,425
Uh, Rachel.

735
00:35:57,493 --> 00:36:01,129
Um, so Dr. Freedman told
me how exhausted you are.

736
00:36:01,196 --> 00:36:03,264
I'll be okay.

737
00:36:03,332 --> 00:36:05,033
Well, you're probably just anemic.

738
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,001
It's very common in young mothers.

739
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:09,404
- Uh, this should help.
- Is that...

740
00:36:09,471 --> 00:36:12,040
Among other things, it
treats iron deficient anemia.

741
00:36:12,107 --> 00:36:14,909
So if you feel like you need it,

742
00:36:14,977 --> 00:36:17,779
that would be up to you.

743
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:42,036
Okay, guys. Let's go. Are we ready?

744
00:36:42,104 --> 00:36:45,573
Come on. Come on, come on.

745
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:47,775
- Bye.
- Bye.

746
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:54,616
Sometimes you don't tell
the person you le something

747
00:36:54,683 --> 00:36:56,684
to protect 'em.

748
00:37:00,189 --> 00:37:02,523
I have a question for you.

749
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:04,492
When you slept with my father,

750
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,461
when you helped him cheat on my mother,

751
00:37:06,528 --> 00:37:08,930
uh, what did you say to him to make him

752
00:37:08,998 --> 00:37:12,133
- behave actually like a human being?
- Addison, he is a human being.

753
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:16,137
- Are you that gullible, lonely? Is that it? What is it?
- It wasn't like that.

754
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:18,239
So then what was it
like? Tell me, because of

755
00:37:18,307 --> 00:37:21,442
all the faceless, nameless
women he's rolled around with,

756
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,178
you're the first one I can actually ask.

757
00:37:24,246 --> 00:37:27,115
Okay, um, if you... if
you really want to know,

758
00:37:27,182 --> 00:37:30,618
it was, um... it was wonderful.

759
00:37:30,686 --> 00:37:32,553
No, I'm... I'm sorry
if... if that hurts you

760
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:34,722
or if it doesn't jibe
with how you see him,

761
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,457
but he was kind and caring.

762
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:39,060
He was a real gentleman. He helped me.

763
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:41,462
He's the first person in a long time

764
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,431
that made me feel normal.

765
00:37:43,499 --> 00:37:46,801
And maybe I was wrong for
doing it, maybe we both were,

766
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:48,836
but he's not a bad person.

767
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:51,004
- And I didn't mean to hurt you, Addison...
- Well, but you did it anyway.

768
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:53,046
Well, you told Pete.
Did you mean to hurt him?

769
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:53,830
That's different.

770
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,511
But you did it anyway.

771
00:38:01,717 --> 00:38:03,985
- Get out.
- But, daddy, I don't think...

772
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:06,521
Get out of this car, go in the house

773
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:10,191
apologize to your mother and mean it,

774
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:13,061
because if you screw up again...

775
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:15,564
She will kill you.

776
00:38:17,612 --> 00:38:20,003
And I will help her
hide the body this time.

777
00:38:20,003 --> 00:38:21,578
So... go.

778
00:38:44,293 --> 00:38:46,414
I love her, but, man, sh...

779
00:38:46,414 --> 00:38:47,312
I know.

780
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:50,543
What are we gonna do, Sam?

781
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:54,179
- What if she keeps this up? What's the next step?
- We gotta stay tough...

782
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,579
stay together on this.

783
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:09,120
Addison?

784
00:39:11,587 --> 00:39:14,622
I have tolerated them.

785
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,491
I may not have forgiven you,

786
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:18,654
but I have tolerated them all.

787
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:19,767
This is different.

788
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:22,383
- She's a consenting adult.
- No, she is not.

789
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:24,784
In addition to being my
friend and my colleague,

790
00:39:24,784 --> 00:39:27,499
- Violet is damaged.
- I understand that's how you see her...

791
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:31,019
- You took advantage.
- I don't think Violet feels taken advantage of.

792
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:33,308
She doesn't. She called you a gentleman.

793
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:35,343
She said that you were wonderful to her.

794
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:37,845
You know, and as bad as
I've felt about myself

795
00:39:37,913 --> 00:39:39,747
for covering for you
for all of these years,

796
00:39:39,815 --> 00:39:41,783
and as depressg as it is

797
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,751
to watch Archer follow
in your footsteps...

798
00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:45,090
Nothing compared to hearing that,

799
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,938
because it made me wonder, daddy.

800
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:50,124
Why is it that you can be so good

801
00:39:50,192 --> 00:39:52,060
to every woman in the world

802
00:39:52,127 --> 00:39:55,496
except Bizzy and me?

803
00:39:55,564 --> 00:39:58,967
Especially when we're the
ones that love you the most.

804
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:15,249
Bizzy, hi.

805
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:18,098
Listen, if you don't come out
here and tell her the truth,

806
00:40:18,098 --> 00:40:18,824
I will.
