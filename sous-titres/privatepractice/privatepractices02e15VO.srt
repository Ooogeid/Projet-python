1
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:13,040
Come on, come on, come on.

2
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:17,566
I need you.

3
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:26,419
Oh, god, you...

4
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:29,018
Oh, you just...

5
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:32,572
You bring something out in me.

6
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:38,703
Well, I'd like to think
it's the best in you.

7
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:41,508
Or the worst.

8
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:58,273
Archer.
Why are you being such a tease?

9
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:00,066
What are you doing?

10
00:01:11,747 --> 00:01:13,240
Archer? You're okay.

11
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:15,942
You're okay.

12
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:20,781
<i>Private Practice S02E15 Acceptance</i>

13
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:27,124
- That's good. She's at plus-2 station.
- That's good.

14
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:29,101
Where's Naomi?
She promised she'd come.

15
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:31,781
We paged her. Hopefully she'll come.
But we promise you, Maggie,

16
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:34,713
you're in very good hands.
I have everything under control.

17
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:37,553
But she's my good luck charm.
Where is she?

18
00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:44,193
- Don't give me that look. I'm fine.
- You're not fine. You had a seizure.

19
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:46,790
Blood pressure's 120 over 80. Pulse...
regular and 70.

20
00:01:46,915 --> 00:01:48,852
Eyes... equal and responsive.

21
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,683
- You know you need...
- No tests.

22
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:53,821
I don't even need to be here. I told
you that. I told the paramedics that.

23
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,793
A healthy person your age
does not just have a

24
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:57,613
a tonic-clonic seizure
out of the blue.

25
00:01:57,707 --> 00:01:59,401
Actually, that's not true.

26
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:02,413
I'm the badass brain guy.
Yes, I had a seizure.

27
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:05,311
And while I could lecture you on the
fact that the brain is a complex organ

28
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:08,440
firing off neurons and electrical
impulses which occasionally

29
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:11,081
short-circuit for totally
benign reasons,

30
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:13,482
instead, I'm signing myself out.

31
00:02:13,788 --> 00:02:16,972
- What, against all medical advice?
- Against your medical advice,

32
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:21,063
which makes you my doctor, so you
have doctor-patient confidentiality.

33
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:23,961
What? Wait, wait...
You want me to lie to Addison?

34
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:40,670
- You need to see someone.
- I'm fine.

35
00:02:40,936 --> 00:02:42,782
No, you're doctor.
You know better.

36
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:45,543
You need to see Addison or Naomi
about the pregnancy today.

37
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:47,460
And you sound like crap.

38
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:49,762
I didn't know you were moving in
to be the pregnancy police.

39
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:52,291
I am your friend, and I'm
helping you out, and I have

40
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,880
the added benefit of being
a highly trained physician.

41
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:56,913
So as long as you are preg...

42
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,883
Together again.

43
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,263
- Look, we're not...
- Of course not.

44
00:03:13,388 --> 00:03:14,792
That was humor.

45
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:19,613
It just seems...

46
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:23,222
well, the office, the elevator,
your house, together...

47
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:24,303
it's...

48
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:26,092
- It's nice.
- Yes.

49
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:27,532
It is nice.

50
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:30,181
- We're friends.
- Of course.

51
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:34,632
You called me the other day.
I'm sorry. I should've...

52
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:37,890
We're all busy people. You'll call me,
when you have time.

53
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,182
Oh, look...
The happy couple.

54
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:47,650
This has gotta stop.
We have to talk.

55
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:50,530
When you can explain moving in
with Violet, we will.

56
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:53,962
If you knew why,
you would see that it's actually right.

57
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:56,071
If I knew why, which I don't.

58
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:59,841
So right now, you are nothing but a guy
who moved in with another woman.

59
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:05,223
Why is it taking so long?

60
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:07,000
- She's still at plus-2.
- What does that mean?

61
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,063
It means that the labor's
not progressing and

62
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:12,442
the baby has variable decels we're gonna
need to perform an assisted delivery

63
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:14,570
to help guide the baby out.
It's very safe.

64
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:16,630
Dell would you prep
the vacuum extractor, please?

65
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:18,951
- Vacuum what?!
- It's gonna be fine, honey.

66
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:22,682
- I've never done one of these.
- It's okay. I'll guide you through it.

67
00:04:23,506 --> 00:04:26,542
Okay, place the cup
directly on the vertex.

68
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,312
Now, Maggie, when I tell you,
I need you to push as hard as you can,

69
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:33,420
and while you push,
we will take the baby out, okay?

70
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:35,803
Ready?
And push.

71
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,650
That's great, Maggie.

72
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:44,282
- The baby's crowning.
- Take it out!

73
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:51,552
- It's a girl. It's a baby girl.
- Congratulations.

74
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:54,661
The discoloration on her head?

75
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:57,363
It's just a hematoma. It happens
sometimes with a vacuum delivery.

76
00:04:57,467 --> 00:05:00,613
- Her apgar is low.
- Dell, don't worry.

77
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:03,762
She's fine.

78
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:05,622
You did great.

79
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,330
Wait... I thought you and Charlotte
were back together.

80
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:11,433
- We were.
- So what happened?

81
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:12,693
Well, I...

82
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,352
She's...

83
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:16,830
- It's complicated.
- Well

84
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:19,812
- You know what I like about Sonya?
- She's not complicated?

85
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:23,152
- She says exactly what she thinks.
- Well, be careful what you wish for.

86
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:28,463
What are you doing here? I thought
I was meeting you at the hospital later.

87
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:30,640
Mom said we should come here
before surgery.

88
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:31,631
Were is she?

89
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,250
She went to go get money
and she's not back yet.

90
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,301
I have to go to the bathroom, bad.

91
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,950
It's... right down the hall
to your left.

92
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:40,872
Thanks.
Oh, I forgot.

93
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:43,253
Mom said I should give you this.

94
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:55,850
- What? What's wrong?
- Her parents...

95
00:05:57,008 --> 00:05:58,300
They dumped her.

96
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,081
They're not coming back.

97
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:08,990
You're here.

98
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,472
I paged you. Jake and Maggie Klein
were asking for you.

99
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:14,422
They had their baby.
Beth.

100
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:17,111
- That's wonderful. Wonderful.
- You're okay?

101
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:18,670
Yeah, I just...

102
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:20,682
I... had a rough morning.

103
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:23,923
Look, if my brother's causing you
trouble, just dump him.

104
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:27,552
Come on.
That was supposed to be funny.

105
00:06:28,785 --> 00:06:30,593
Yeah, I...
You know what?

106
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,860
Can you excuse me a minute?

107
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:44,561
I hate lies.
Something is wrong.

108
00:06:44,685 --> 00:06:45,683
I'm fine.

109
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:47,940
Close the door.
I'll show you how fine I am.

110
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:49,110
It's not funny.

111
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,982
If you were fine, you would've let
the doctor examine you today.

112
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:54,281
You would've let them run tests.
So what is it?

113
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:56,733
Is it an aneurysm
or a stroke or... A.V.M.?

114
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:59,412
- Who's the neurologist here?
- You won't tell me what's going on,

115
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:01,361
and I'm thinking the worst here.

116
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:04,312
You don't know how scary it was for me
this morning.

117
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:12,093
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry isn't gonna make me feel better.

118
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:15,963
Sorry is not gonna make me not worry.
You need to tell me what's wrong.

119
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:19,410
I can help you. Come on.
We can... we can figure it out.

120
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:27,313
It's a tumor...

121
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:30,160
a glioma in the third ventricle
of my brain.

122
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:35,983
- Can...
- It's inoperable.

123
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:37,970
There's nothing they can do.

124
00:07:53,508 --> 00:07:55,111
There's something I...

125
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:56,852
want to tell Addison,

126
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,881
- but I can't.
- You can't?

127
00:07:59,116 --> 00:08:02,663
I was asked specifically
by someone not to tell.

128
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:07,600
You were asked specifically by someone
not to tell Addison something specific?

129
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:10,481
Okay... to a week ago,
I would've said Pete, maybe Coop.

130
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:13,352
But this definitely reeks of Archer.

131
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:18,272
It... involves doctor-patient
confidentiality.

132
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:21,303
Which would apply if you were
Archer's doctor, which you're not,

133
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:23,690
unless he's trying to get pregnant.

134
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:26,593
I'm sorry. You're not giving me much
to go on here.

135
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:28,682
It's something medical.

136
00:08:32,248 --> 00:08:36,601
So... do you keep a secret
for a man that you care about,

137
00:08:37,646 --> 00:08:39,671
or do you lie to your best friend?

138
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:49,803
- How's she doing?
- She isn't responding to the pacifier,

139
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:53,051
and... she's barely cried, and...
the bruise, it looks worse.

140
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:55,530
Well, her color's good.
She's active.

141
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:57,393
Let's see those feet.

142
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:00,163
She responds to stimulation.

143
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:02,590
Maybe you should order a C.T.
or an M.R.I. just to be sure.

144
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:05,832
This is all within the range
of normal after an assisted delivery.

145
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:07,781
But if there's a chance
something's wrong, I...

146
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:09,444
something you could...

147
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,502
- I just, I want her to be okay.
- I know you do, and so do I.

148
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:15,422
But this baby isn't sick.

149
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:24,932
Patty's parents aren't answering
their phone,

150
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:27,881
and there's no contact information
for their work or for their cells.

151
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:31,690
- How did she hurt her knee?
- Car accident. She was 5. Hit-and-run

152
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:35,263
internal injuries, which, you know,
she got over. Walking has been hard.

153
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,193
We had to wait for the bone to grow more
before we could reconstruct the knee.

154
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:41,220
And her parents just walked out
the day of the surgery?

155
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,920
Patty is out there reading
to her Teddy bear.

156
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:47,652
I haven't told her yet. I told
her her parents were still at the bank

157
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:49,731
and that things were taking longer
than they should.

158
00:09:49,777 --> 00:09:51,543
She knows something's wrong.
You know that.

159
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:53,362
Kids know when something's wrong.

160
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:55,760
- You have to report this.
- Her parents

161
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:58,132
- are good people.
- They bandoned a sick child.

162
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,043
Child and family services
needs to be involved.

163
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:03,500
And the police. The safe haven program
is for babies. This is abandonment.

164
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:05,952
Her parents are having
financial problems.

165
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:07,832
Maybe they're just freaked out
by the surgery.

166
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:10,123
Just give me a few hours.
I'll find them.

167
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:12,893
The surgery's elective.

168
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:14,730
If we turn her over
to family services,

169
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:17,192
they won't pay for it,
and she needs the surgery.

170
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:18,361
She needs her parents.

171
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,542
Well, not all parents
should be parents.

172
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:23,950
So if you want to, go look for them,
but... let me talk to her first.

173
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:27,232
Let's make sure this family
is worth being put back together.

174
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:31,923
So Dr. Cooper...
is he, like, your best friend?

175
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:34,910
What about you?

176
00:10:35,155 --> 00:10:37,183
- You have a best friend?
- Felix.

177
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:40,900
And does felix live at home with you
and your family?

178
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:44,022
What does a family look like?

179
00:10:44,337 --> 00:10:46,223
Can you show me with the dolls?

180
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:48,791
There's a momm

181
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,490
and a daddy

182
00:10:50,787 --> 00:10:52,602
and me...
and Felix.

183
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:56,600
So I'm gonna start a sentence,
and I want you to finish it, okay?

184
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:58,081
So i'll say...

185
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:01,023
I like it when my mommy...

186
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:03,250
- and then you say...
- Hugs me.

187
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,152
And I don't like it when my mommy...

188
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:07,560
Gets sad.

189
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:12,750
And what about the daddy?
What does the daddy do?

190
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:15,033
A daddy comes home at night.

191
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:17,821
And what does he do
when he comes home at night?

192
00:11:18,097 --> 00:11:19,931
He crawls into bed with me.

193
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,021
And what does he do
when he crawls into bed with you?

194
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:27,080
Sometimes he reads me a story,

195
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:29,513
but most of the time,
he just snores.

196
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:42,712
- I need to tell you something.
- Something good or something bad?

197
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:45,871
Something bad.

198
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:48,433
Archer asked me not
to tell you, but...

199
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,062
what did he do to you?

200
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:52,283
Last night, Archer had a seizure.

201
00:11:52,516 --> 00:11:55,510
And it's not the first seizure he's had,
Addison.

202
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:57,352
It's cancer...

203
00:11:58,406 --> 00:11:59,400
a glioma.

204
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:00,693
It's...

205
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:02,321
Inoperable.

206
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:05,862
He says he saw
everyone in New York...

207
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:07,520
C.T. scans,

208
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:10,071
second opinions, third opinions...

209
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:12,441
and he says that there is

210
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:14,653
nothing to do.

211
00:12:17,785 --> 00:12:20,180
- Where is he now?
- He's downstairs.

212
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:23,132
He says he doesn't want
to talk about it.

213
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:25,460
Right. Well, we'll get...
his scans from New York.

214
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,532
We'll figure out exactly what it is
and how we fight it.

215
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:30,610
You can't

216
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:32,683
Don't tell me what I can
and can't do, Nai.

217
00:12:32,808 --> 00:12:35,620
I'm his sister, I'm a doctor,
and there's always something

218
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:37,290
hat we can do.

219
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:47,602
- So?
- Everything she demonstrated...

220
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:50,311
concept of family structure,
parent-child roles...

221
00:12:50,386 --> 00:12:52,140
suggests that the family
life is healthy.

222
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:55,032
- So if I can find 'em...
- Go find 'em.

223
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:03,683
Could I borrow you for a few minutes?
It's...

224
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:05,203
kind of important.

225
00:13:09,218 --> 00:13:10,863
Addison, I am so sorry.

226
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:12,953
I saw him yesterday on the elevator.
He was fine.

227
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:14,521
Don't talk about him like he's dead.

228
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:15,800
Have you talked to him?

229
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:18,682
I'm trying to get his scans
from New York. I need ammunition.

230
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:22,212
If you give me some "stages
of grief" crap, I will throw something.

231
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:24,563
Okay, look, I don't need
the super friends here, okay?

232
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:26,430
I don't need moral support.
I'm fine

233
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:28,422
he's not, and I'm gonna fix it.

234
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:32,641
Well...
Nai says he's taking it well.

235
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:36,660
He's every creating drama
like he always does. Secrets...

236
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:40,401
I know he doesn't want help, but
he's gotta be scared.

237
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:43,322
I know I would be.
I mean, look at all of us.

238
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,411
None of us wants to think that...

239
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:47,413
Got it.

240
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:50,023
What, his scans?
They released them to you?

241
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:52,282
After 15 phone calls to every
hospital in New York,

242
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:55,971
ten calls to every neurologist and one
very effective e-mail to the doctor

243
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,502
who wrote the preface
to Archer's last book.

244
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:30,693
You wanted a consult on...

245
00:14:34,037 --> 00:14:36,511
- You convened a panel?
- The doctor says it's operable.

246
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:38,953
One thought so.
Three doctors said no.

247
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:41,060
They'd have to tear through half
of my brain to get this.

248
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:42,330
- What about chemo?
- Radiation?

249
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,400
Chemo is not proven effective
with this kind of lesion,

250
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:47,271
and radiation would fry all
brain tissue before it made a dent.

251
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:49,460
- I'd lose my sense of humor.
- You can't just give up.

252
00:14:49,585 --> 00:14:52,620
I'm not giving up. At the rate this
is growing, I could have 5 years...

253
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:55,622
five great years,
and I get to keep all my hair.

254
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:58,431
- I'll adjust my seizure medication.
- What if it's not slow growing?

255
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,110
What if, instead of a couple of years,
it's a couple of months or worse?

256
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:02,993
When was your last C.T. scan?

257
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:06,271
You know her. She's not
gonna give up on this.

258
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:11,711
These were my last.

259
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:13,710
They were taken...

260
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:15,913
Three weeks ago.

261
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:18,630
They followed a set from two months ago
and another set before that.

262
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:21,913
Wait, read that date again.
This time, don't tilt your head.

263
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,041
What?

264
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:29,031
He has an upward gaze palsy.

265
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:31,142
Sam's right.
You can't look up.

266
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:34,472
But that's not consistent with
third-ventricle glioma, is it?

267
00:15:34,537 --> 00:15:36,273
Well, what else could it be?

268
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:40,382
We need to do another C.T. scan.
We need to do it now.

269
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:45,380
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Very.

270
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,422
- How are you feeling?
- Beat up...

271
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:50,542
But happy.

272
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:53,382
Jake went home to take a shower.

273
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:57,101
Thanks for taking care of her
so I could get some sleep.

274
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:00,681
Has she... has she nursed yet?

275
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:06,673
Is there something wrong, Dell?

276
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:10,022
Everything's fine.
Okay, here.

277
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:26,280
You should've told me.

278
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,953
What, you moved to L.A.
Because you want to be closer to me?

279
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,422
And it's a lie. You lied.
You knew you were sick.

280
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:33,470
You knew and you didn't tell me.

281
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:36,490
- What were you thinking?
- I wanted to make up for lost time.

282
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:40,121
By lying to me when I can help you?
And then you tell Naomi?

283
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:42,561
She saw the seizure.
I didn't have a choice.

284
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:47,182
Whatever's going on, there is something
in my brain that can't come out.

285
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:49,403
And now that you know,
everything's about me dying.

286
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,661
You got that look in your eye,
that underlying pity.

287
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:52,812
- It's not pity.
- It is

288
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:54,521
and I didn't want to come here
and look at you every day

289
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,101
- And see that
- You are my brother, 

290
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:57,642
You're the only family I have

291
00:17:57,697 --> 00:18:00,241
- the only sane family...
- We're ready.

292
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:09,411
This is really gonna make
your knee feel better, okay?

293
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:13,113
It's okay.
You don't have to be scared.

294
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:16,421
- It doesn't hurt that much.
- He is really brave.

295
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:18,533
- What's his name again?
- Felix.

296
00:18:18,826 --> 00:18:20,372
You know what, Felix?

297
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:21,643
We...

298
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:22,970
are...

299
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,141
done.

300
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:31,980
So if your parents
had trouble at the bank,

301
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:34,450
- Who do you think they'd call?
- I don't know.

302
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:36,162
Do your mom and dad have a

303
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,252
good friend they talk to a lot or...

304
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,173
My mom talks to aunt Katie.

305
00:18:40,296 --> 00:18:42,980
Is that your mom's sister?
Do you know where she lives?

306
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:44,400
Near Disneyland.

307
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:48,440
Did something happen to them?

308
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,941
Did they get into an accident?

309
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:53,340
- Are they dead?
- No... God, no.

310
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:56,902
Your parents...

311
00:18:58,686 --> 00:19:01,353
I think they're going through
a tough time, and,

312
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,711
They need to figure some things out.

313
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:06,571
You're lying.

314
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:22,963
It's almost twice the size.

315
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:25,092
And there are two more lesions
on the cortex.

316
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:27,130
A tumor wouldn't
expand that quickly.

317
00:19:27,347 --> 00:19:29,153
No, it wouldn't.
Is it metastatic?

318
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:30,522
Not in this position.

319
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,380
- Multifocal abscess?
- No fever, no source.

320
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:34,283
Then...

321
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:35,240
What?

322
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:36,510
Well, maybe...

323
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:38,752
- Zihuatanejo.
- What?

324
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:42,250
Zihuatanejo. I was there six months ago
for a book junket.

325
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:45,183
- What are you talking about?
- It's not tumors.

326
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:48,281
- Neurocysticercosis.
- Parasites?

327
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:52,491
Parasites.
I have parasites in my brain.

328
00:19:57,557 --> 00:19:59,020
Forgot what it was like

329
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:02,782
in the side of thinks just being...
I'm here in a waiting room.

330
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,441
Bud*** gaz tests confirms it

331
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:09,422
A mass of a parasistic cysts.

332
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,070
- I'm calling Derek he can take him out.
- I mean, I haven't a tumor,

333
00:20:12,196 --> 00:20:14,510
but it still in my third ventricle
this does'nt change that.

334
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:16,182
But you thought you had five years.

335
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:18,361
These lesions are warm sacs
in your brain

336
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:20,151
They can burst at any moment
and you could die

337
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:22,791
Or, I can take any parasitics
instead it to kill them

338
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:25,983
They'd might kill him, they could also
send your immune system into overdrive.

339
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:28,150
You end up with brain swelling,
more seizures.

340
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:30,191
Which would rupture
the remaining cysts.

341
00:20:30,318 --> 00:20:32,873
Do you realize how lucky you were
last night that that didn't happen?

342
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:34,801
On the other hand,
the drugs could cure me.

343
00:20:34,886 --> 00:20:37,113
All due respect to your ex-husband,
even in Derek's hands,

344
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:39,181
there's a 1-in-4 chance
I'm a vegetable.

345
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:42,082
Or I could die on the table
or I could die from complications.

346
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:45,422
You're a surgeon.
It's your instinct to cut, not mine.

347
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:49,251
Addison, he... has a right
to make his own decision.

348
00:20:49,306 --> 00:20:51,581
Come on, Nai. What, you've been
sleeping with him for a few weeks

349
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,241
and now you're on his side?

350
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:55,473
It's his field and it's his life.

351
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:59,422
- It's risky, but...
- Drugs can work.

352
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,380
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,751
Derek may be your answer,
but he's not mine.

354
00:21:03,877 --> 00:21:05,370
This isn't your choice.

355
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,181
I delivered a baby today, and...
I think I did something wrong.

356
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,313
- And... you want to tell me about it?
- I just...

357
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:24,600
I placed the vacuum too low,
I think.

358
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:28,563
I used too much force, and...
she's got this...

359
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:29,981
Like, red mark.

360
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:32,561
And I'm afraid there might be
bleeding in the brain.

361
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:34,892
- What does Addison say?
- That she's fine.

362
00:21:35,098 --> 00:21:36,442
But she won't do a C.T. scan

363
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:38,590
and she won't check, and...
and now she's not even here.

364
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:40,503
You asked for a diagnosis,
and she gave it

365
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:42,121
Now she's gotta
focus on her brother.

366
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:43,470
Who is getting every test
under the sun,

367
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,651
which is great, it's great,
but, you know, why can't

368
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:47,982
the baby
that I delivered get just one?

369
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:49,330
You know what I think?

370
00:21:49,456 --> 00:21:53,670
I think that you want her to run a test
to treat your anxiety and not the baby.

371
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:58,733
If Addison says the baby is healthy,
then accept it.

372
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:01,713
Whatever you did worked.

373
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:05,500
You okay?

374
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:12,901
Can I trust you with something?

375
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:15,393
I can't believe it.

376
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:17,653
- You, pregnant.
- I don't want anyone to know.

377
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:19,771
What about the father?
I mean, does he know?

378
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:21,213
It's complicated.

379
00:22:21,268 --> 00:22:22,932
Well, you don't owe me
any explanations.

380
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:25,553
It could be Pete
or it could be Sheldon.

381
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:28,770
Keeping it local.
That's... Cool.

382
00:22:33,157 --> 00:22:34,302
Look at that.

383
00:22:35,225 --> 00:22:37,922
- I don't see anything.
- That's the heart.

384
00:22:39,856 --> 00:22:41,730
- Is it beating?
- Strong.

385
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:45,771
Good cardiac activity.
Rate of 150.

386
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:47,781
Everything looks good.

387
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:51,451
The cramping's probably just from
your uterus expanding.

388
00:22:51,577 --> 00:22:53,473
It's nothing to worry about.

389
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:55,430
Oh, my god.

390
00:22:56,665 --> 00:22:58,121
I'm actually pregnant.

391
00:22:58,246 --> 00:22:59,933
That's a...
that's a baby.

392
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:01,660
That's...
my baby.

393
00:23:02,387 --> 00:23:04,453
That is a tiny human being.

394
00:23:04,578 --> 00:23:07,143
Your pulse is racing.
I need you to breathe.

395
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,831
I'm... I'm pregnant.

396
00:23:08,925 --> 00:23:10,861
I'm... I mean, there's...

397
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:12,871
You've having a panic attack.

398
00:23:13,606 --> 00:23:16,782
Concentrate on my breathing, okay?
Slow and easy.

399
00:23:17,205 --> 00:23:18,881
Deep breaths.
In...

400
00:23:20,336 --> 00:23:21,330
And out.

401
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,112
How did you find us?

402
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:44,891
Told me about your sister.
It wasn't that hard to find the address.

403
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:47,102
You shouldn't have come here.

404
00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:03,340
That's it?
You see me standing here, you...

405
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:05,783
- Got nothing to say?
- I'm... sorry.

406
00:24:05,905 --> 00:24:07,353
You're her parents.

407
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:10,173
Maybe you lost your house,
and maybe things are bad,

408
00:24:10,297 --> 00:24:12,442
and... there are probably things

409
00:24:12,695 --> 00:24:15,490
I don't know, things that make your life
excruciatingly hard,

410
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:17,380
but Patty loves you.

411
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:20,703
And this surgery, she needs it.

412
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:23,731
- She needs you.
- We can't.

413
00:24:26,997 --> 00:24:28,442
- You're good people.
- We're not.

414
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:30,621
I've known you since your
daughter was 6 hours old,

415
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:33,582
- through the accident, through rehab...
- And all of that ruined us.

416
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:36,053
The bills, they never end,
day after day.

417
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:37,540
We don't have the money.

418
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:39,751
- Our insurance is gone.
- I can talk to the hospital.

419
00:24:39,837 --> 00:24:41,433
It's too much, Cooper.

420
00:24:41,905 --> 00:24:44,560
She's too much for us.
We can't do it anymore.

421
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:47,130
I know what you must think of us...

422
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:48,342
But

423
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:51,102
- we're done.
- That's it? You're done?

424
00:24:51,307 --> 00:24:54,913
That lite girl is smart and strong,
and she survived a car accident

425
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,751
and all the surgeries and all the pain,
and for a kid like that,

426
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:01,151
I would walk over broken glass
to help her...

427
00:25:06,308 --> 00:25:07,453
You are done.

428
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,290
You don't deserve her.

429
00:25:18,187 --> 00:25:19,690
Looks like you're good at your job.

430
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:23,281
I'm not a doctor, but yes, I know
a thing or two about pregnant women.

431
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:25,023
- So my cramps?
- Aren't about the baby.

432
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:26,503
What are you talking about?

433
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:28,312
I have an alien being
growing inside of me.

434
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:30,653
It's not the only thing
growing inside you.

435
00:25:30,777 --> 00:25:33,502
I mean, keeping this a secret,
not telling Pete or Sheldon...

436
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:36,830
the guilt, the anxiety, it grows,
and it'll swallow you up.

437
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:38,860
It's not good for you

438
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:40,802
or the baby, okay?

439
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:42,920
You need to tell them.

440
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:47,573
I can't.

441
00:25:49,195 --> 00:25:50,193
Not now.

442
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:52,403
Don't forget these.

443
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:23,730
When I was 7, I fell off my bike.

444
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:26,391
Do you remember?

445
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:28,942
We were on the vineyard...

446
00:26:29,538 --> 00:26:33,922
Not just fell off, we were going
downhill and my tire came loose,

447
00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:36,542
and I went over
the handlebars and I...

448
00:26:36,758 --> 00:26:38,451
I scraped my whole face.

449
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,840
Remember?

450
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:45,821
We were about a half-mile
from home, and you...

451
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,613
you picked me up...

452
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:53,093
You told me it was gonna be okay,
and you carried me

453
00:26:53,496 --> 00:26:54,491
home.

454
00:26:56,787 --> 00:26:58,583
You weren't even that big.

455
00:27:00,277 --> 00:27:04,361
But you were my big brother,
and you knew I was scared...

456
00:27:05,116 --> 00:27:06,812
And you carried me home.

457
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:12,881
Who's gonna carry me home
if you die?

458
00:27:19,915 --> 00:27:22,891
I fix things, Archie.
It's what I do.

459
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:26,703
I want to fix this for you.

460
00:27:31,296 --> 00:27:33,092
Some things you can't fix.

461
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,910
They're not coming, are they?

462
00:27:58,496 --> 00:27:59,502
I'm sorry.

463
00:28:01,258 --> 00:28:03,030
I know it's not what
you want to hear.

464
00:28:03,156 --> 00:28:05,313
It's not what I want
to be telling you.

465
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:08,460
But it doesn't mean
that they don't love you.

466
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,643
It just means that right now...

467
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,702
They can't be here.

468
00:28:18,355 --> 00:28:19,370
It's okay.

469
00:28:23,657 --> 00:28:25,450
I need a favor, Charlotte.

470
00:28:25,877 --> 00:28:29,241
I need three more nurses, six more hours
in a day, mandatory martinis at lunch

471
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:31,551
to know why the man
I was sleeping with is

472
00:28:31,605 --> 00:28:33,170
- living with another woman.
- I have a little girl

473
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:35,493
who's scheduled to have surgery
at St. Ambrose today.

474
00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:37,970
- I need it to happen.
- The problem is?

475
00:28:38,025 --> 00:28:42,681
Her parents signed all the pre-op forms
and all's good to go. They abandoned her

476
00:28:43,007 --> 00:28:45,510
This is what D.C.F. sis for.
You call, they take the kid.

477
00:28:45,638 --> 00:28:48,392
And then she never gets the surgery.
She was in an accident at 5.

478
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:50,331
She limps. She has back problems.
She crushed her knee.

479
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:52,153
It needs to be reconstructed.

480
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:54,720
It's considered elective surgery.
D.C.F.S. won't pay for it.

481
00:28:54,848 --> 00:28:57,412
The parents are required
to sign their children in, period.

482
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,743
- Risk management requires it.
- And if we just

483
00:28:59,817 --> 00:29:01,282
assume that they did?

484
00:29:01,755 --> 00:29:03,103
You waltz in here

485
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:07,022
and expect me to violate hospital
ethics, to essentially commit fraud,

486
00:29:07,108 --> 00:29:08,073
for you,

487
00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:10,212
who won't even break
Violet's confidence for me?

488
00:29:10,276 --> 00:29:11,442
You're mad at me.

489
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:12,911
I probably deserve it. But

490
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:16,862
there is a girl who's been sitting
alone in my office for eight hours

491
00:29:16,946 --> 00:29:18,690
waiting for a surgery
to change her life,

492
00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:23,523
a surgery that she doesn't get unless we
skip a step in the process

493
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:27,040
and just let things progress
the way they're supposed to.

494
00:29:33,656 --> 00:29:35,803
Don't help me.
Help her.

495
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:45,773
It's all right, Violet.
Just...

496
00:29:46,016 --> 00:29:47,682
- say it.
- Whatever it is, just...

497
00:29:47,776 --> 00:29:49,013
Right. Good.

498
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:50,920
Just say it.

499
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,520
I'm pregnant.

500
00:29:57,287 --> 00:29:58,950
I know. It's crazy.

501
00:29:59,587 --> 00:30:01,031
It's wrong. It's...

502
00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:03,471
awful.

503
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:07,331
But I want to be clear that
I have no expectations here.

504
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:10,313
I know neither of you want kids,
so you don't have to worry.

505
00:30:10,436 --> 00:30:12,710
I actually don't know whose it is,

506
00:30:12,835 --> 00:30:14,492
which is... crazy,

507
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:16,340
I know, but...

508
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,671
but whichever it turns out to be,
it is not your responsibility,

509
00:30:20,797 --> 00:30:21,691
it's mine.

510
00:30:21,818 --> 00:30:23,533
And there's nothing
that you need to do.

511
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,092
Cooper has moved in with me.
He's looking after me.

512
00:30:26,216 --> 00:30:27,913
It'll all be taken care of.

513
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:30,570
So now you know.

514
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,031
Okay?

515
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:36,932
This is how you want to handle this?

516
00:30:37,058 --> 00:30:40,960
You think that this is how either
of us wants to handle this?

517
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,750
Divide and conquer,
isn't that right, Violet?

518
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:45,563
You don't want a conversation
about this.

519
00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:48,181
You've decided what we want
and how we feel

520
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:49,671
and how we'll react
and what we'll say,

521
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:51,970
so you... just drop this bomb
in front of both of us.

522
00:30:52,028 --> 00:30:54,852
- I didn't want to say anything until...
- you decided on your own

523
00:30:54,975 --> 00:30:57,121
without consulting anyone,
anyone who...

524
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,452
might...

525
00:31:00,396 --> 00:31:03,360
So I take it that you're
going to keep it.

526
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:09,822
I'm gonna keep it.

527
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,390
And now i'm gonna be sick.

528
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:24,561
You are gonna love me.
A 1945 bord...

529
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:37,612
Call 9-1-1!

530
00:31:40,328 --> 00:31:43,080
That's it, Archer.
You're okay...

531
00:31:58,695 --> 00:32:01,603
The paralyzing agent has caed his body,
but the seizures aren't stopping.

532
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:02,831
They'll stop.

533
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:05,713
Neurologist says they may not.

534
00:32:06,437 --> 00:32:08,550
He's not your brother,
but he's good.

535
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:10,062
He knows what he's doing.

536
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:13,061
How long before the seizures
cause permanent neurological damage?

537
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:15,530
There's no way to know, but
given the intensity and the duration,

538
00:32:15,578 --> 00:32:18,570
- I don't think we have a lot of time.
- Time for what?

539
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:22,550
He wants to use a general,
induce coma.

540
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:25,861
Put Archer's brain to sleep.
It'll stop the seizure cycle.

541
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:27,702
He may not come out of that.

542
00:32:27,777 --> 00:32:29,621
He's not coming out
of statuts either.

543
00:32:29,688 --> 00:32:32,220
But the longer we let these seizures
go on, then the bigger the chance

544
00:32:32,277 --> 00:32:34,923
that everything that makes Archer.
Archer...

545
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:36,603
gets burned away.

546
00:32:46,228 --> 00:32:47,303
I'll do it.

547
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:02,021
This is gonna help you, Archie.

548
00:33:07,576 --> 00:33:09,061
It'll help you rest.

549
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:18,892
There we go.

550
00:33:30,735 --> 00:33:33,292
He needs the surgery
to remove the parasite.

551
00:33:33,675 --> 00:33:35,731
Archer doesn't want it.
He was very clear about that.

552
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:39,133
That was before this. He went into status
because the parasitic sack shifted.

553
00:33:39,155 --> 00:33:41,173
- Maybe. We don't know that.
- We don't have time

554
00:33:41,235 --> 00:33:43,312
to try the drugs.
The drugs are too risky.

555
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:46,381
- If we started the drugs immediately...
- It's not fast enough.

556
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:50,280
It'd take a week, maybe ten days even.
That... that's what they said.

557
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:54,071
I am as scared as you are of losing him,
but we have to respect his wishes.

558
00:33:54,128 --> 00:33:57,081
I'm tired of respecting him.
I want to save him.

559
00:33:58,395 --> 00:33:59,943
I want to call Derek.

560
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:03,032
Archer said no,
and if you go down that road...

561
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:07,400
I will not accept that we are supposed
to just stand by and watch him die.

562
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:09,900
It's my choice.
I'm making it.

563
00:34:11,147 --> 00:34:12,342
Make the call.

564
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:23,463
Come on...

565
00:34:27,507 --> 00:34:28,550
I need you.

566
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:43,920
I know all about the five stages
of grief. I'm

567
00:34:44,046 --> 00:34:46,352
trying to figure out
the five stages of shock.

568
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:47,541
I'm pissed.

569
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:50,403
Kind of.
I don't know.

570
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,570
You don't know?
You don't know how you feel?

571
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:54,953
- Do you?
- Like I said, I'm pissed.

572
00:34:55,648 --> 00:34:56,983
She kept it from...

573
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,370
us.

574
00:34:59,087 --> 00:35:00,800
But how do you feel about...

575
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:04,091
She's gonna have a kid,
yours or mine.

576
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:07,253
Is it true that you don't want kids?

577
00:35:09,038 --> 00:35:12,343
I'm sorry. I had no right to ask.
I just...

578
00:35:13,395 --> 00:35:14,661
I'm reeling. I...

579
00:35:15,515 --> 00:35:17,751
Kids just don't seem to like me.

580
00:35:18,045 --> 00:35:20,960
I wish they did. I've always like them.
They just...

581
00:35:21,498 --> 00:35:23,543
Don't like me, and maybe...

582
00:35:24,738 --> 00:35:26,133
If it were mine...

583
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:32,622
I wanted kids a lot a long time ago.

584
00:35:33,488 --> 00:35:35,680
But I told myself it was better...

585
00:35:36,655 --> 00:35:38,321
That I didn't have them.

586
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:39,901
But it's not...

587
00:35:40,378 --> 00:35:41,373
better.

588
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:54,663
- She just woke up screaming.
- We can't calm her down.

589
00:35:54,788 --> 00:35:57,020
What's wrong?
Did we do something?

590
00:35:58,167 --> 00:35:59,161
I think...

591
00:36:00,185 --> 00:36:01,490
she's hungry.

592
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:14,821
Look at her.

593
00:36:15,277 --> 00:36:16,473
She's perfect.

594
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:18,690
She is.

595
00:36:30,577 --> 00:36:33,072
- Am I better?
- The surgery went well.

596
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:36,441
- It went really, really well.
- My knee won't hurt?

597
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:38,262
I predict that you

598
00:36:39,025 --> 00:36:40,463
will be dancing

599
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:42,630
and anything else you want.

600
00:36:47,035 --> 00:36:49,702
Patty, I wanted to introduce
someone to you.

601
00:36:49,826 --> 00:36:52,493
She's gonna make sure
that you're taken care of.

602
00:36:58,235 --> 00:37:00,643
This is...
this is Michelle.

603
00:37:01,656 --> 00:37:02,653
And...

604
00:37:03,116 --> 00:37:05,331
She's a friend of ours.
She's really nice.

605
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:08,760
And she's from a place called...
child and family services.

606
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:13,583
They take care of kids
when their moms and dads can't.

607
00:37:14,955 --> 00:37:16,720
But what about you...

608
00:37:17,357 --> 00:37:18,940
and Violet?
Can't you...

609
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:21,313
I'm sorry, Patty.
I wish we could.

610
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:26,361
I've heard a lot about you.
I hear you're doing really well.

611
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:29,370
- I just want to go home.
- I know.

612
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:35,641
Michelle's gonna keep you safe.

613
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:37,652
And she's gonna help
you get through this.

614
00:37:37,737 --> 00:37:40,780
You and Felix are gonna watch out
for one another.

615
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:43,291
And I'll still be your doctor.

616
00:38:03,986 --> 00:38:04,981
I heard.

617
00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:08,911
Called social services soon
as she went under, and the police.

618
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,083
And Violet.

619
00:38:19,395 --> 00:38:21,690
It's been a terrible day, Charlotte.

620
00:38:22,528 --> 00:38:25,421
I looked that girl's parents
in the eye, and...

621
00:38:26,378 --> 00:38:27,630
They do not care.

622
00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:29,943
And the surgery is good.
The surgery is gonna help.

623
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:32,210
But at the end of the day,
that girl...

624
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:35,693
Doesn't have parents anymore.

625
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:40,083
The only thing I can think of that
might make me feel any better...

626
00:38:41,618 --> 00:38:43,000
Is being with you.

627
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:47,641
I know being with you
would make me feel better.

628
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:54,230
Violet's pregnant.
That's the secret.

629
00:38:54,287 --> 00:38:56,363
That's why i'm moving in with her...

630
00:38:56,928 --> 00:38:58,601
Because she's freaking out.

631
00:38:58,695 --> 00:38:59,700
Are you...

632
00:39:00,677 --> 00:39:01,932
Is it your...

633
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:05,263
I'm not the father.
I'm the best friend.

634
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:06,530
Violet has...

635
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:10,192
always been there for me.
She shouldn't have to do it alone.

636
00:39:10,246 --> 00:39:11,443
What about me?

637
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:15,642
- I love you.
- What about me when I have our baby?

638
00:39:16,598 --> 00:39:19,300
Your first child was supposed to be
with me.

639
00:39:20,746 --> 00:39:23,590
Those moments
were supposed to be ours.

640
00:39:25,158 --> 00:39:27,200
Enjoy your first child, Cooper.

641
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:30,230
They say there's nothing like it.

642
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:47,012
So you gonna keep the baby?

643
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:56,883
You know what?

644
00:39:58,545 --> 00:40:01,143
I think I might be
a pretty good midwife.

645
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:06,853
I think you are.

646
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,880
The medevac's gonna meet us
at Santa Monica airport.

647
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:19,033
We'll be in Seattle in less
than three hours,

648
00:40:19,106 --> 00:40:21,580
and in the O.R.
45 minutes later.

649
00:40:25,677 --> 00:40:27,770
You're gonna be okay.
You are.

650
00:40:28,786 --> 00:40:30,350
You better get better.

651
00:40:38,705 --> 00:40:40,942
Come with me.
He'd want you there.

652
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:42,873
I need you there.

653
00:40:43,368 --> 00:40:44,813
Go. I got Maya. Go.
