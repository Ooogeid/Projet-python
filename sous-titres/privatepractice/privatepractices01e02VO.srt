1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,500
what are you people doing in my house?

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,780
I told you. It's a surprise.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,170
it's a surprise for Sam.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,260
You know about this?

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,760
Sadly,I do.

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,700
If it's a surprise for sam,then
why aren't you at Sam's house?

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,430
Put that down.

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,740
'Cause that would totally
ruin the surprise,wouldn't it?

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,650
Wait,what are you doing?

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,850
Cooper thinks sam's in a rut.

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,350
what-- well,I am not in a
rut,okay? And,in fact,I have plans.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,350
You have plans? With who?

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,850
With Naomi.

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,760
- You invited Naomi here?
- Hey...

15
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,710
no,see,actually,no,that's no good.

16
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,770
Well,it's good for me.

17
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,140
It's good for Naomi. Naomi's my friend.

18
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,280
You, people,I barely know.

19
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,590
The thing is, Naomi kind
of steps on the surprise.

20
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,800
What kind of surprise is this?

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,970
one named Ginger.

22
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,120
- What?
- What?

23
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,010
I'm outta here.

24
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,760
Oh,she's about to ring the doorbell.

25
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,850
Five minutes.

26
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,320
Ah,okay.

27
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,460
Now we're getting somewhere.

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,130
They can't stop us,buddy. Right?

29
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,710
Sam?

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,810
Cooper,how do you even
know how to find a stripper?

31
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,280
Ginger is not a stripper.

32
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,980
She's an entertainer.

33
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,660
What does that even mean?

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,520
I'm still trying to figure it out.

35
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,050
Sam is not like you, Cooper.

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,690
- He's not interested in- 
- I think Sam is.

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,670
Sam and a stripper,who knew?

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,860
Hey,it's just getting good. Could you...

39
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,970
a stripper?

40
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,650
Oh,you like that?

41
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,260
You have something.

42
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,130
Thanks. You're sweet,too.

43
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,740
- No,you got something right here.
- Huh?

44
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,290
Let me just get a closer look.

45
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,050
Uh,yeah.

46
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,060
hey,man.

47
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,440
What were yothinking?

48
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,340
It's a long,sad story.

49
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,450
Hey,did she do the thing where
she,um-- could be pneumonia,

50
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,330
and I'm gonna set
them up with an x-ray.

51
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,820
You're not fooling anybody, Cooper.

52
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,990
Who's up first?

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,570
Uh,Dave Walker called this morning,uh,
complaining of headache and nausea.

54
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,530
I heard his wife left him.

55
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,030
Yeah,and he's drinking again.

56
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,990
Got his son and his
mother living with him.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,050
So I'm gonna go check him out.

58
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,010
- You do house calls,too?
- We.

59
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,130
We all do house calls.

60
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,970
- What?
- Nothing.

61
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,340
I got the O'Briens bringing
their baby in again.

62
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,270
9-month-old girl,she's
been sick since birth.

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,390
O'Brien--is that
the dad who's--

64
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,210
yeah,he's totally
disconnected from this baby.

65
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,320
It drives me crazy.

66
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,850
I tried to get him in to see you. No go.

67
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,740
Well,let me know if I can
be of any help on the case.

68
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,420
You want to help me?

69
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,850
What?

70
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,490
Anything else?

71
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,350
- Uh,yeah,I have two cases
next week- - nobody?Super.

72
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,480
Pete,do you think that,uh,acupuncture
could help with a patient that's,

73
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,740
uh,presenting with-- just--could you tell
me,did she do the triple-jointed thing?

74
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,130
All right,and I'll be leaving.

75
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,270
Does it even occur to you
to think of Naomi's feelings?

76
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,050
so wait,do they know?

77
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:30,890
Does Naomi know?

78
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,990
Back to the triple-jointed thing.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,070
It--it--it looks like it hurts,but
in the most awesomest way.

80
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,940
This--this--
look,did she do this?

81
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,480
Amber Johnson.

82
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,670
Hey. Are you mad at me?

83
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,360
Amber Johnson.

84
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,430
Because it kind of seemed like
you were mad at me in the meeting.

85
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,950
I'm just looking out for Naomi.

86
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,510
Hi, Amber. see you next week,Thomas.

87
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,640
Addison is mad at me because
Cooper hired a stripper.

88
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm ignoring the stripper.

89
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,810
Today is a day for ignoring things.

90
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,830
I am all business today.

91
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,250
Who's my next patient?

92
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,160
This guy wants to talk to you.

93
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,900
Sign,please.

94
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,420
Oh,no.

95
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,260
That's a nice bike.

96
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,820
No? Okay.

97
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,210
Looks like Emily's gained
some weight. That's good.

98
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,550
She been sleeping?

99
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,000
Better,don't you think?

100
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,700
No,I don't,actually.

101
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,780
You know,we said it was gonna be a long haul
when she was born with these symptoms. So...

102
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,170
I just feel like,when is she
gonna catch a break,you know?

103
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,900
Well... here you go.

104
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,400
Come here,Emily. Look at that guy.

105
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,220
Who's that guy?

106
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,120
You know,just to be safe,I am
gonna run a couple more blood tests.

107
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,530
Oh,she hates needles.

108
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,800
If it was optional,I wouldn't
do it,but it's not,so...

109
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,260
okay?

110
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,630
Did you know you have an office here?

111
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,940
Here,it's--it's
right next door.

112
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,120
I am asking because I am
curious,not because I care.

113
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,440
What's her name?

114
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,200
Who's name?

115
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,480
The girl. The girl, Sam.

116
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,100
Ginger.

117
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,180
Her name is Ginger?

118
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,390
Hey,I did not name her.

119
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,850
I didn't hold her up to the moon
and do the whole kunta kinte thing.

120
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,790
This isn't "roots".

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,890
Oh,you funny-- you funny man.

122
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,200
Her name is Ginger.

123
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,950
Did you sleep with Ginger?

124
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,310
And you're asking
because you're curious?

125
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,520
- Yeah.
- YeS.

126
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,810
- Samuel!
- No,I didn'T.

127
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,280
I just wanted to see what
"curiosity" looked like.

128
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,200
It's an awful lot like jealousy.

129
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,720
I am not jealous.

130
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,330
Oh,yes,you are.

131
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,280
If I want to see a stripper,I'm
gonna see a stripper.

132
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,840
Shoot.

133
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,850
I'm grown.

134
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,340
Tryin' to tell me... come on, Dave.

135
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,870
I know you didn't go to work.

136
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,000
Dave probably gets to see strippers.
Probably got one in there right now.

137
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,020
I know you didn't make me
come out here for nothin',dave.

138
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,240
Come on.

139
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,520
Dave!

140
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,160
Dave!

141
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,910
Dave,open the door.

142
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,520
Ms.Walk,open up the door.

143
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,100
all right.

144
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,320
- how long has he been
like this? - I-I don't know.

145
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,940
I just came downstairs
and he was--I-I don't know.

146
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,630
All righT. Ms.Walker,how
long's he been like this?

147
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,890
Grandma?

148
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,310
Yes,this is dr.Sam Bennett.

149
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,920
I need an ambulance immediately.

150

152
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,600
Dave,what happened in there?

153
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,030
Oh,I don't know. I...

154
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,080
had breakfast,getting ready for work,next
thing I know,I'm hugging the toilet.

155
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:16,910
What's wrong with him?

156
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,760
Well,once we get to the
hospital,we'll figure that out.

157
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,190
But he's coming back?

158
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,830
Of course I am, Stevie.

159
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,270
Stevie,I don't want you
to be here by yourself.

160
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,670
I'm okay. My--my
grandmother's here.

161
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,480
Yeah.

162
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,490
Fellas,would you mind,uh,taking the
boy and his grandmother with you?

163
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,160
I'm worried about leaving
her in charge. All right.

164
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,480
Do you want to talk about Sam.

165
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,710
- well,not Sam-
- I mean,clearly not-

166
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,110
- Will you say it? say it. 
- It's not--

167
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,060
Sam's stripper.

168
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,840
Sam's stripper. Say it.

169
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,420
So what?

170
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,870
So? And Sam's single.

171
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm single...

172
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,590
so single,and--and
single people move on.

173
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,250
Yeah.

174
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,210
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,110
I've been looking at
this in my office all day.

176
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,930
You bought a bike?

177
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,290
Yeah,it's custom built,it's from italy,and
Allan is never getting his hands on it,ever.

178
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,590
I don't care if it costs $6,000.

179
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,240
You bought allan a $6,000 bike?

180
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,280
I-I ordered it last year.
It just arrived today...

181
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,710
on his birthday.

182
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,800
Brutal.

183
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,190
Why don't you sell it?

184
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,240
yeah. Yeah,maybe I will.

185
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,470
Or give it
away.Just--

186
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,400
great. Exactly.

187
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,030
I'm gonna give it away.

188
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,210
Hey. Hey.

189
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,600
You will not give Allan that bike.

190
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,900
I won't?

191
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,660
Will you be strong?

192
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,960
Yeah.

193
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,760
Strong.

194
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,160
I-I told my teacher there's
probably no way you could do it,but--

195
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,910
do what?

196
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,960
Speak at my midwifery class.

197
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,300
I told my teacher about Naomi,and--and
she called you "a primal life giver.

198
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,050
-I think I have something that night,so-
- come on.

199
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,140
Do it.

200
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,980
Might give you a boost.

201
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,230
I don'T... I don't need boosting.

202
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,090
I'm fine.

203
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,340
I'll do it.

204
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,610
I love talking to midwiffs.

205
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,240
yeah,actually I think-- I thk
we're-- we're good on O.B.S but--

206
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,740
oh,I'm actually a double board
certified uh,neonatal surgeon.

207
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,920
One of the best... in the world...

208
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,810
with a specialty
in genetics-- D.N.A.

209
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,140
Uh,well,yeah,maybe,you
know,if,um,if someone drops out.

210
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,060
You can't get more primal
and life giving than D.N.A

211
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,510
Dell?

212
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,690
Excuse me.

213
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,820
Uh,do you still have
time for that consult?

214
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,200
- The little girl?
- Yeah.

215
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,000
Um,please tell I'm reading that wrong.

216
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,670
Cooper asked for a second opinion,but
the genetic tests we ran confirm that

217
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,030
Emily has a serious presentation of
something called pelizaeus-merzbacher disease.

218
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,680
How do we cure it?

219
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:00,310
Well,there's medication to treat
the symptoms,but there is no cure.

220
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,740
So she'S...

221
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,220
not going to get better?

222
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,460
Ever?

223
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,980
The drugs can give her
five years,maybe more.

224
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,580
What? Five year--five?

225
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,560
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,260
I know this is difficult to hear.

227
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,960
And we will do everything that we can.

228
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,690
Wait,you said that this was genetic.

229
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,720
So one of us made her sick?

230
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,070
No,you can't think of it like that.

231
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,830
Because my sister,she's
trying to get pregnant.

232
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,710
I mean,could she have this,too?

233
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,320
We'll have to run some blood tests.

234
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,520
We'll see which
mutation you're carrying.

235
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,430
It's important not only for
your sister,but also for you,

236
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,680
if and when you should decide
you want other children.

237
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,980
No. Emily-- Emily is all we need.

238
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,040
Excuse me. I'm looking
for a dave walker.

239
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,840
He came in with vomiting
and severe dehydration.

240
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,380
He was released 15 minutes ago.

241
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,660
On whose orders?

242
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,860
You don't release my
patient without calling me.

243
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't lecture me on medical etiquette.

244
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,850
The vitals were normal,we needed
the bays,and he wanted to leave.

245
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,460
Probably just had some 24-hour bug.

246
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,440
Well,it didn't look like a bug.

247
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,140
He was unconscious when I found him.

248
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,030
He saiit was something he ate,but he
tested negative for E.Coli,salmonella--

249
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,990
that still leaves about a hundred other
possibilities,none of which require hospital stays.

250
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,850
He was fine, Sam.

251
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,790
Besides,grandma said
she could handle it.

252
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,010
The same grandma who
couldn't call 9-1-1?

253
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,680
That's why you don't release
my patients without calling me.

254
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,840
Any word back about the little girl?

255
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,660
Yeah,but the test results
don't make any sense.

256
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,140
Sometimes they can be
hard to read. Let me see.

257
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,770
- This does not...
- no,no.

258
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,220
You see the...

259
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,220
this doesn't make any sense.

260
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,140
Which mutation did the
parents pass on to Emily?

261
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,280
None.

262
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,340
Well,how is that possible?

263
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,630
Because they're not her parents.

264
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,000
Emily is ours. She's my baby.

265
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,690
Uh, there's the chance
that this was human error--

266
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,990
the hospital nursery wristbands
fell off, got mixed up.

267
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
There is also the possibility that
someone may have done this on purpose.

268
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,830
Are--are you accusing us?

269
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,980
I mean, you think that we wanted this?

270
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,140
Right now, all you have to
do is take care of Emily,

271
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,640
and we'll find out what happened.

272
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,970
I'm telling you, there is
something wrong with this guy.

273
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,640
We tell him his daughter's
dying, he's cold as ice.

274
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,620
We tell him he's not the father,

275
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,320
he gets defensive right off the bat.

276
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,090
People react to terrible
news in different ways.

277
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,870
It's his child. Show some emotion.

278
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,060
Where did Beth give birth?

279
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,890
St. Ambrose.

280
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,190
Oh, perfect.

281
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,690
- Charlotte King's hospital.
- I'm going over there.

282
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,080
No, you--you need to stay here
and just calm down. We'll go.

283
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,570
Fine.

284
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,640
where are those nursery records?

285
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,420
There was no stolen baby reported-- not
in this hospital,not while I was chief.

286
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,330
Well,then two sets of parents
went home with the wrong babies.

287
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,460
I swear,do you all take some kind of
perverse pleasure in ruining my life?

288
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,200
Yeah,there are switched babies
out there,but this is about us.

289
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,970
This hospital has the
best nurses in the city.

290
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,300
Neonate spent a fortune on security.

291
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,890
Did st.Ambrose institute nap
time,or do I still have a staff?

292
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,100
Then why don't you show us the
records for the other babies

293
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,450
that were in the nursery the
time that Emily was there?

294
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,620
Will someone just br-- thank you.

295
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,200
There was only one other african-american
girl in the nursery at that time.

296
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,840
Who is it?

297
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,830
This hospital spent 124
years building its reputation.

298
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,760
I am not gonna ruin that
by chatting with you.

299
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,360
Can you just give us the name?

300
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,120
Not until I talk to our attorneys.

301
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,270
Blood pressure 125 over 84.

302
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,960
- That's normal.
- Yeah.

303
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,100
- I feel a lot better.
- Okay.

304
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,750
Maybe a little shaky.
What--what do you think it was?

305
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,690
Still not sure.

306
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,390
Just to be safe,why don't you
clean the kitchen top to bottom?

307
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,110
It's not the food that got him sick.

308
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,860
Ma,please.

309
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,370
Oh, Stevie. Close the door,honey.

310
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,330
I'll leave it open. Then the next time dad passes
out,no one's got to break a window to get in.

311
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,370
Hey, Stevie.

312
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,140
Is he okay?

313
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,890
Oh,he's just bullheaded,like his dad.

314
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,860
what are you gonna do?

315
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,160
And your mom?

316
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,190
We're doing real good,doc.

317
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,110
Things are good.

318
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,980
so what am I missing?

319
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,590
Well,in 90% of these cases,it comes
down to history and environment.

320
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,570
Oh,well,the environment's all messed up.

321
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,020
The dad's drinking,grandma's got way more
than she can handle,the kid's acting out.

322
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,340
That sounds a lot more
serious than a 24-hour flu.

323
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,700
see,that's why I'm worried.

324
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,580
They've got enough to deal with as is.

325
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:02,360
And if david's got something really
serious,I'm not sure how they hold it together.

326
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,690
- Hey,coop.
- Hey...

327
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,980
Ginger.

328
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,180
I didn't recognize you in...

329
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,890
I didn't recognize you.

330
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,140
Tell me that is not the
girl from last night.

331
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,650
Cooper's bringing 'em to work now?

332
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,590
Oh,my god. That's it.

333
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,700
He has just crossed the line.

334
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,010
Sam just hugged a stripper.

335
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,790
God,at least with Cooper,you
know what you have.

336
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,130
Okay,now let's all calm down.

337
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,860
Sam is not a dog. He never was.

338
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,470
Now there could be a totally
innocent explanation for this.

339
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,950
What--what--what,for
stripper hugging?

340
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,210
Give me one. Give me one.

341
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,630
Well...

342
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,120
like she's here to see the real dog.

343
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,130
Oh,would--would
you look at him?

344
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,010
He's all... "I'm a
doctor.My touch heals.

345
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,060
can I talk to you?

346
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,060
- I spoke to our attorneys.
- And?

347
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,690
Some days I really hate
the hippocratic oath.

348
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,730
Here.

349
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,060
Here's the file on the second
african-american baby in the hospital nursery.

350
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,670
You're just giving it
to us,just like that?

351
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,780
If you think I'm being
nice,read the name.

352
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,320
Oh,god.

353
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,090
What?

354
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,480
And my problem becomes your problem.

355
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,350
Melinda and Duncan Stinson.

356
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,960
You know them?

357
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,590
I got them pregnant.

358
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,370
what do you think of
your handiwork, Naomi?

359
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,340
oh,she is so cute.

360
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,910
And if you tell me I've got more
hormone's to take,I'm gonna scream.

361
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,160
Oh,no. No,no,no.

362
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,710
It's just,uh,we need to run
some blood tests on all of you.

363
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,370
What's going on?

364
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,300
so how are you holding up?

365
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,170
I'll be better when we
find out who did this?

366
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,600
All your nurses check out?

367
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,130
One moved a few days later,but
her record was impeccable.

368
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,320
Well,something happened in that nursery.

369
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,990
You don't know that.

370
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,480
That doesn't stop you from
tossing the blame my way.

371
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,660
I know that if one of my patients was in this much
pain,I would be busting my ass looking for answers.

372
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,280
Thank you.

373
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,960
I hadn't gotten my earful
of Oceanside arrogance today.

374
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,670
look at him.

375
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,750
How is that guy and the guy who
hired me a stripper the same person?

376
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,180
he's Cooper.

377
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,300
So this other couple...

378
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,370
their baby was born the same night?

379
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,970
That's right.

380
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,160
We're--we're running
blood tests on them now.

381
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,320
What if the other blood
tests come back positive?

382
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,280
This is the hard part.

383
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,160
according to California law...

384
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
you would...

385
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,930
say good-bye to Emily...

386
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,610
and you would welcome a
new child into your lives.

387
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,200
That's--that's ridiculous. Okay?

388
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,540
The blood tests are not
gonna come back positive

389
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,680
and I don't care what
our blood tests said-

390
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,320
- honey,honey-
- no.No.

391
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,760
I know Emily is my daughter,okay?

392
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,410
A mother can feel these things.

393
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,760
I don't love that other child.

394
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,300
I couldn't love another baby.

395
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,700
I love Emily.

396
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,920
Well,why don't we just wait for the
results of the blood test and go from there?

397
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,320
Emily's had a hard time,now she
has to adjust to a whole new family?

398
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,430
Well,the babies are young.

399
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,550
You know,adoptions take place
at this age all the time.

400
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,800
The kids are usually fine.

401
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,890
It's the parents I'm worried about.

402
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,340
They're the ones who grieve.

403
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,890
Greg O'Brien doesn't
seem to be grieving.

404
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,330
What is up with you and this case?

405
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,320
Your emotional attachment is huge.

406
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,600
You're one to lecture me about
unhealthy emotional attachments.

407
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,070
Okay,that was a nice deflection.

408
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,540
But unlike you,I am detaching.

409
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,190
You want to try it?

410
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,170
It's yours.

411
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,740
Light.

412
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,540
Why didn't Allan buy his own bike?

413
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,010
On our third anniversary,you
know,we took that trip to italy,

414
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,170
and he took me to the town where they made those
because even as a child he had--he'd wanted one.

415
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,980
So he saved up his money...

416
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,410
But then his dad split on his mom,

417
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:20,130
so he had to use his savings to
pay rent and to keep his mom afloat.

418
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,530
And he never got the bike.

419
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,370
What? What?

420
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,590
Take the bike. You love it.

421
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,290
Yeah,I loved it when I thought it
was a cool,sexy,"get me laid" bike,

422
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,660
not some sad, Allan-y
"cat's in the cradle" bike.

423
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,260
hey.

424
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,200
Is that stripper still in your office?

425
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,530
Entertainer not stripper,and yes.

426
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,810
And she's been in there all day? Why?

427
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,790
We're trying a few different techniques.

428
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,640
oh,yeah,I'm sure you are.

429
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,660
You know what?

430
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,720
Naomi does not need
ginger thrown in her face.

431
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,670
Naomi is a big girl. She can handle it.

432
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,130
She doesn't have to.
That's why I'm here.

433
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,850
Pete,is it supposed to feel tingly?

434
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,900
"Pete,is it supposed to
feel..." you know what?

435
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,780
Go.Go
do--

436
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,970
take care of your poor little
stripper girl and her "tingly".

437
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,110
Entertainer,and why
are you so angry at me?

438
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,950
- You--I- 
- Cooper's the one that set this--

439
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,440
you know,I am trying to
take care of my friend.

440
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,460
And Cooper is bad,but you're worse.

441
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,140
And you know why? Because
you're slippery.Yeah.

442
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,410
You walk around pretending to be all
soulful,but you don't take the heat.

443
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,190
You just do whatever you
want to do and you evade.

444
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,870
Evade,evade,evade.

445
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,250
Do you need me to kiss you again?

446
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,150
No!

447
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,410
Okay.

448
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,740
You're back.

449
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,550
Nurses' schedules...

450
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,430
perinatal testing,personnel files.

451
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,170
What'd you find?

452
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,720
Not a damn thing.

453
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,770
I have been through every one
of these backwards and forwards.

454
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,560
You're so sure my hospital ruined these
people's lives,then help me prove it.

455
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,960
please! Someone hurry!

456
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,550
Help me!

457
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,710
Please!

458
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,760
Sam! Sam,front.

459
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,540
Hey! Hey! Help!

460
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,700
- Please,help me!
- Yeah,ma'am,it's all right.

461
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,180
- Sam!
- Stevie,what's going on?

462
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,980
Whatever my dad had...

463
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,670
I got it worse.

464
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,790
I got home., Grandma made dad and
me some sandwiches,then...pukeville.

465
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,970
Mrs.Walker,what did i tell
you about that kitchen?

466
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,580
Well,it was just a sandwich.

467
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,520
That could've killed him.

468
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,030
where is your father?

469
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,930
At--at
work.

470
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,560
I didn't want to bother him with this.

471
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,440
Mrs.Walker,I understand you
mean well for your family,

472
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,100
but something you are
doing is making them sick.

473
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,600
This is a family matter,doctor.

474
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,830
It doesn't concern you.

475
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,840
Hey, Dell,can you hand carry Stevie
Walker's blood to the lab for me?

476
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,580
Put a rush on it.

477
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,780
Have them screen for ingestible poisons.

478
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,420
Hey. I just got the test
back from the Stinsons.

479
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,880
The O'Brien baby is their babY.

480
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,760
And the Stinson baby
belongs to the O'Briens.

481
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,870
Yep.

482
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,000
How do you tell someone that their
baby was switched with another baby?

483
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,780
Damn it.

484
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,160
well,that was the hardest
thing I've ever done.

485
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,600
You did everything right.

486
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,900
And dad doesn't shed a tear.

487
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,270
How's it going with Naomi?

488
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,720
Well,you know,so far,so--

489
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,360
do you know what you
put my wife through,

490
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,900
what you put us through?

491
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,630
And now you tell us that this--this
other baby who we've never met is sick!

492
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,520
We did everything you asked us to do.

493
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,260
I know how hard you two
worked to get pregnant.

494
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,540
Let down after let down,the--the
miscarriages,the hormones...

495
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,750
you how many shots I
had to stick in her?

496
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,640
She could hardly move
she was so bruised.

497
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,610
I-I wish there was
something I could do.

498
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,650
Yeah,there is something you can do.

499
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,050
You can start by explaining how you--
how you can live with yourself--

500
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,330
taking our money and
promising us a healthy baby.

501
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,560
Duncan,I never promised you perfection.

502
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,140
I promised you a child.

503
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,990
My retirement,vacation pay--
our future!

504
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,050
we spent it all so we
could have our little girl!

505
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,120
Duncan,please.

506
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,210
I want my money back.

507
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,160
I want my damn money back!

508
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,210
your husband...

509
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,290
he has a right to be angry.

510
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,940
So do you.

511
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,160
I could just take Sarah and go.

512
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,490
We could just go away.

513
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,070
No one would find us.

514
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,430
Except you won't.

515
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:11,110
Because Emily is your daughter.

516
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,160
And she is sick.

517
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,790
And a mother never
leaves her child behind.

518
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,450
Not a strong mother.

519
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,910
No. No.

520
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,610
This isn't happening.

521
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,530
I'm not gonna do it.

522
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,730
come on,baby.

523
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,710
Hey.

524
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,670
Stevie Walker's lab results.

525
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,890
Coprine?

526
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,540
From the mushroom?

527
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,490
Ink cap mushrooms contain coprine.

528
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,840
It's like a natural form of antabuse.

529
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,690
When you ingest the mushroom,then
if you drink alcohol you get really--

530
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,280
really,really sick.

531
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,190
So someone's poisoning Stevie?

532
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,650
any luck?

533
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,660
Well,I think we know
when the switch happened.

534
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,570
We have baby Emily's hospital record
and baby Sarah's hospital records,

535
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,720
and then on day two,they switched.

536
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,530
Emily becomes Sarah
and Sarah becomes Emily?

537
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,960
What about this nurse,left town?

538
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,950
No,she was in the E.R. Of my hospital,

539
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,560
laid out with the flu hooked
up to an I.V.All night.

540
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,410
So we're back to square one?

541
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:32,080
My patient is being poisoned
by his own dear,sweet mother.

542
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,930
She's dosing him with ink cap mushrooms.

543
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,720
Which means he's drinking--
boom,on the floor.

544
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,350
- Baby switch.
- Poisoning?

545
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,330
For real?
Baby--

546
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,570
hi. You are not a
member of this practice.

547
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,850
So you have to go ahead and unhear that.

548
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,410
I thought I had a problem.

549
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,500
Yeah,well,maybe we can help you with
yours since we're not getting anywhere.

550
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,590
I-I don't know.

551
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,910
I-I gotta stop the mother
from hurting her son.

552
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,810
Now she's also poisoning her grandson.

553
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,190
But I can't send her to jail,can I?

554
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,930
How could a parent do that to a child?

555
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,040
Let me see the visitor's log again.

556
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,330
Yeah.

557
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:28,000
The first two days,one
person was there constantly.

558
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,320
A parent...

559
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,610
did that to a child.

560
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,130
What you're doing is a crime.

561
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,280
You can't go around poisoning people.

562
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,040
No,I only meant it for David.

563
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,580
I didn't know Stevie was drinking.

564
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,030
So it's okay to poison your own son?

565
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,410
Well,every time he takes
a drink,he pays for it.

566
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,070
That's how you teach my David a lesson.

567
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,170
You have to stop doing this,now.

568
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,020
No.

569
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,870
My family,we're weak
when it comes to this.

570
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,520
David's not weak.

571
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,250
He's an alcoholic.

572
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:08,010
And some old world remedy will not
guarantee that he'll stop drinking.

573
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,440
Now I'm a doctor,and
I'm telling you--

574
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,020
what? You...

575
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,700
you're like all the other doctors.

576
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,720
Oh,you make him go to a 12-step group,

577
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,260
but do you make him stop drinking?

578
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,050
No. So I did.

579
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,860
Please.

580
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,900
You can't tell David.

581
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,010
This will work.

582
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,170
As David's doctor,I can't let it happen.

583
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,170
I'm sorry.

584
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,380
Then you might as well have me arrested.

585
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,490
Because I don't know how long I've got,

586
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,600
and my family means everything.

587
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,040
If I don't protect them,who will?

588
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,530
from birth your baby-- your biological baby--
well,it was difficult.

589
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,930
She had a neurological problem.

590
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,470
She did?

591
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,320
Your c-section caused
severe post-labor pain,

592
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,920
so you were sedated for
most of the first two days.

593
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,220
You wouldn't have been
aware of how serious it was.

594
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,480
But you were,Mr. Stinson.

595
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,960
You were in the nursery 24/7.

596
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,880
And then when your daughter was 2 days
old,she seized while you were holding her.

597
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,430
What are you saying?

598
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,370
What-- what are you saying? I--

599
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,990
She's saying that the next time you were in the
nursery alone is when those babies were switched.

600
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,570
you were the only one there.

601
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,200
It would've been easy enough to switch
off your baby's security bracelet

602
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,510
because she was so small.

603
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,310
No,I'm not gonna stand for this.

604
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,710
If I were that
baby's father--

605
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,690
Mr. Stinson,people's lives have been
altered-- your child's life.

606
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,990
You were supposed to take care of
her,and instead you switched her

607
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,480
because she was sick.

608
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,840
Mr. Stinson,I-I think this is your
opportunity to explain to us--

609
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,390
no,no,no,you explain.

610
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,310
You explain!

611
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,870
3 years and--and $250,000 and
all my wife's hopes and dreams...

612
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:56,750
oh,my god.

613
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:02,830
Melinda,th-this other family,they
can have more kids,healthy kids.

614
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,630
You see?

615
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,250
Duncan...

616
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,940
wait,this isn't--
I'm not a--

617
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,180
Melinda,honey...

618
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:19,430
How could you give my
baby to somebody else?

619
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,990
How could you?

620
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,630
What switch is in your brain and makes
it okay for you to steal a child?

621
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,900
Adults are there to protect children.

622
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,340
We're supposed to keep them from harm.

623
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,960
You're angry at yourself.

624
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:34,830
What?

625
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,490
I'm talking about Duncan
Stinson,what he did.

626
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,300
I'm angry about that.

627
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,990
Right. Before that,it was greg O'Brien.

628
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,660
But it's really about you.

629
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,940
Don't...

630
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,380
do the shrink thing, Violet.

631
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:52,510
You can't blame yourself for not
being able to make her better, Cooper.

632
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,010
She's just a baby.

633
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,280
Dave,we're here because you
have a problem with alcohol.

634
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,640
A problem?

635
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,850
no.

636
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,250
- Maybe I have a glass of wine or a beer--
- Dave.

637
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,820
Once,twice a week,maybe I
drink more than I should.

638
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,770
We need to get you into
a treatment program.

639
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,740
why?

640
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,890
Because I like beer?

641
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,740
Come on.

642
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,010
I don't need treatment.

643
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,710
Dave.

644
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,330
Sorry.

645
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,550
All right,well,you should know that I
figured out why you've been getting sick.

646
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:46,390
Uh,you've developed an
allergy...to alcohol.

647
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,910
what? That's not possible.

648
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,610
Well,it's rare.

649
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,270
Yeah,it's--it's
really rare.

650
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,700
And it probably runs in the family.

651
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,350
So,I mean,you've seen what
happens when you drink.

652
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,470
That's gonna happen every single time.

653
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,110
So I...

654
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,100
I have to stop drinking?

655
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,890
Yeah,you do.

656
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,500
That's my diagnosis.

657
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,690
Now if you continue to get sick,

658
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:14,710
then I'm going to have to consider
that it's something much more serious.

659
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,480
Gloria,you're gonna help Dave make
sure that never happens,not even once?

660
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,870
Oh,yes,yes.

661
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,560
He--well,he--
he's learned his lesson.

662
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,870
come in.

663
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,260
Would you like to sit down?

664
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,360
I think it might be helpful for
us to talk about what happened.

665
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,210
Your husband...

666
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,100
is not my husband anymore.

667
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,270
that other little girl...

668
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,200
your daughter.

669
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,870
She's so sick that she could die?

670
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,790
Yes.

671
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,320
Before she's 5 years old?

672
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,310
Yes.

673
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,000
Melinda...

674
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,140
this is Emily.

675
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,530
This is mama.

676
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,760
This is Emily.

677
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,070
I don't,um...this is a mistake.

678
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,700
I can't-- I-I thought it would feel like--

679
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,540
listen,listen,listen,

680
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,210
it is natural that you would
feel like a stranger at first.

681
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,100
It'll get better.

682
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,570
She's,uh,she's so small.

683
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,060
The condition she has,it's
caused a failure to thrive.

684
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,550
She's so beautiful.

685
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,820
I know.

686
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,590
I sing her to sleep.

687
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,070
Sarah likes...

688
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,900
it's gonna sound stupid,but,uh,I
sing madonna songs to her

689
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,900
'cause they're the only
ones I know all the words to.

690
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,380
But they work.

691
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,360
She goes to sleep so easy.

692
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,830
Emily screams...

693
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,820
every two hours.

694
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,130
But if I...

695
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,390
put her on my chest,the
sound of my heartbeat...

696
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,770
your heartbeat...

697
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,730
it calms her.

698
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,200
Sarah is beautiful,too.

699
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,120
- look at her
- no,I can'T.

700
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,270
I...I can'T.

701
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,520
you have to.

702
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,410
She's yours.

703
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,800
A mother never leaves her child behind.

704
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,940
Hi.

705
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,720
Hi,Sarah.

706
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,160
I thought...

707
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,660
I couldn't watch her die.

708
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,500
And now I can'T...

709
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,430
let her go.

710
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,370
I'll get you a tissue.

711
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,940
I'm fine.

712
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,390
It's okay. It'S...

713
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,230
it's been a big day.

714
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,990
Montgomery...

715
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:18,070
I'm chief to over 200 physicians.

716
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,550
you call this a big day?

717
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:24,480
This place is making you soft.

718
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,100
god...

719
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:59,380
I am a wreck.

720
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,070
Long day.

721
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,510
We just sent a man to jail for trying
to get rid of his own kid,but...

722
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,670
your day sounds really hard.

723
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,640
I didn't know.

724
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,980
No,of course not.

725
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:22,680
You spent the entire day dealing with the
perils of aromatherapy and,uh,your stripper.

726
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,940
I know you don't believe
me,but I like my women real...

727
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,460
real skin...

728
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,820
real breasts...

729
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,200
real lines arountheir eyes that mean
they've really lived and had pain.

730
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,760
You show me that woman...

731
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,420
and I'm interested.

732
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:56,040
And...not in a slippery way.

733
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,870
And, Addison...

734
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,840
I think it's great that
you try to care of Naomi.

735
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,180
But...

736
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,280
who takes care of you?

737
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,460
No Ginger.

738
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,350
She can't be her. Ginger cannot be her.

739
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:27,760
Okay...you're gonna have to translate from
freaked-out language to normal-people language.

740
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,760
The first woman you date
after me has to be...

741
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:34,570
she has to--look,she cannot be some
stripper with clear platform shoes and--

742
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,340
and a suspicious skin condition.

743
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,340
Naomi,eventually I'm
going to start dating.

744
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,060
I know that.

745
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,920
And when that happens,you do not
get to have a say in who I date.

746
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,390
I know that.

747
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,460
So...

748
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,050
so fine,date.

749
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,220
But it can't be Ginger.

750
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,520
And we're back to crazy.

751
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,040
Hey,you know what? I'm a catch.

752
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:56,300
I-I do "the new york times'" crossword
puzzle in pen,I eat vegetables,

753
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,730
I have a very good sense of humor,and I
don't do pilates 'cause I think it's fun.

754
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,120
I mean,have you seen me?

755
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,120
If you date Ginger after you're with
me,if she is what you are choosing,

756
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:11,990
if--if your big dream is
rashy-skinned strippers,then what...

757
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,910
- what were you--
- what was I doing with you?

758
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,350
Yeah,you know what?

759
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,700
Forget it.

760
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,170
The next girl I date will be amazing.

761
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:28,760
She will be beautiful,she will be
intelligent,and she will be rash free.

762
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,660
She'll be better than me?

763
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:34,210
She will be way better than you.

764
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,380
Okay?

765
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,100
Okay.

766
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,370
That's sweet. Thank you.

767
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,760
Vye,open up.

768
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,300
I think I might need
to borrow some tools.

769
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,030
The--the frame's
still in one piece.

770
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,220
The wheels came off and the chain,

771
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,430
but I-I think I might need
a-a blowtorch or a hacksaw.

772
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,380
Do you have a hacksaw?

773
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,610
Is this helping?

774
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,300
Yeah. Yeah,actually.

775
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,900
It's very therapeutic.

776
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,650
Oh,damn it. I am so full of crap.

777
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,770
I went over to Allan's with the bike.

778
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,670
But he'd already gotten one...from Cami.

779
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,390
Yes,he told her the bike story.

780
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,670
It took him two years to
tell me the bike story.

781
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,000
They've been together,what,a day?

782
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:41,890
And he told her the bike story.

783
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,870
- I'm an idiot.
- No,you're not.

784
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,370
No,I am. I am. I am.

785
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,870
He's married. It's over.

786
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,170
I am an idiot.

787
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,420
Violet,you are not.

788
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:57,960
You're just--you're,uh,you're
just honest.

789
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,960
That's your fatal flaw.

790
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,280
It's my favorite thing about you.

791
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,040
All right.

792
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,260
Come here.

793
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,840
You want to help me run
the bike over with my car?

794
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,070
Absolutely.

795
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,590
look at him,st sitting up
there with that dumb little dog.

796
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,130
Well,if you want,we could...

797
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,260
I mean,you want to go and say hi or...

798
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:46,740
or you could just look a little longer.

799
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,140
Yeah,the last one.

800
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,130
Okay.
