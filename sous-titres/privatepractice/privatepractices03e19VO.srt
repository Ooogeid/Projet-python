1
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:05,548
I'm here, I'm here. You paged me?

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,035
Why do you have this baby in my hospital?

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,054
It's Lucas. Pete's son. He had
a child remember? You were there.

4
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:14,170
- Why do you have that baby here?
- He is taking over for
Naomi, she's out of town.

5
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:16,719
- You paged 911, I was
looking after Lucas.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,568
The nanny is meeting
me here and he meant it.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,724
Now, come on, what is up?

8
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:22,632
Kayla Lindy, the coma mama.

9
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:24,651
Her husband's bringing in the big guns.

10
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:27,617
- Who is big guns?
- Dr. Ginsberg.

11
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:29,532
*** Dr. Ginsberg?

12
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:31,439
He wants her to wake if
wife up from the coma.

13
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:34,448
You gonna keep playing mommy,
or you gonna get in there?

14
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,939
Okay. Here. Take the baby. (Babbles)

15
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:39,305
Take the baby, Charlotte.

16
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,311
Take the baby. Okay?

17
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:43,917
Yeah. The nanny will be here
in about ten minutes, okay?

18
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:46,194
Here you go. Take it.

19
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:49,741
Ooh. Be good. (Babbles)

20
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:52,260
(Exhales deeply) Hello.

21
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:53,983
I'm Charlotte.

22
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:56,546
Please don't drool on me.

23
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,560
(Eddie) And then drew got
a triple, slid into third

24
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:00,334
and scraped the hell out of
his ankle, but you know drew.

25
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:03,829
He didn't care. You'd have
been really proud of him. Hey.

26
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:08,750
So... Dr. Montgomery's here.

27
00:01:08,774 --> 00:01:11,731
And Dr. Ginsberg will
be here any minute now.

28
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:18,410
I know you think she can't hear me,

29
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:20,361
but, uh... maybe she can.

30
00:01:20,385 --> 00:01:23,119
A-and when Dr. Ginsberg
gets here and wakes her up,

31
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:25,816
I just want her to know that...

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,266
I didn't give up on her.

33
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,817
Eddie, I need to talk to you.

34
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:31,728
Dr. Ginsberg is an extremely
accomplished neurosurgeon,

35
00:01:31,752 --> 00:01:34,028
but Kayla has been...

36
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,629
She's been in a coma for six weeks.

37
00:01:35,653 --> 00:01:37,728
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

38
00:01:37,752 --> 00:01:39,161
Did you know Ginsberg revived a patient

39
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:43,828
who was comatose for 17
years? I'll get my miracle.

40
00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:46,536
We'll get our miracle. I
mean, she's gonna wake up.

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,732
- I don't know why you have to be so negative.
- Eddie...

42
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:51,104
Why can't you just believe?

43
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:55,109
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:57,605
It's just, uh...

45
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:03,708
I unplugged the love of my
life, and she didn't die.

46
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:06,081
She didn't die.

47
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:09,168
That's gotta mean
something, you know? And...

48
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:11,300
I'm Dr. Ginsberg. This is my team.

49
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:12,847
- Which one are you?
- Oh. Hello.

50
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:15,661
- Dr. Montgomery or Dr. King?
- Dr. Montgomery. Pleasure to meet you.

51
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:17,378
And this is Eddie Lindy, Kayla's husband.

52
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:20,675
- Thank you so much for coming all this way.
- I prefer that family members wait outside

53
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:22,628
during the diagnostic process.

54
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:24,968
- Dr. Ginsberg...
- No, no, it's, uh, that's fine.

55
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:26,623
Whatever it takes.

56
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:30,839
Okay, uh, patient is Kayla
Lindy, 32 years of age,

57
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:32,649
surrogate mother pregnant with triplets.

58
00:02:32,673 --> 00:02:35,797
During the pregnancy,
complications led to a pulmonary...

59
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,957
I'm familiar with the file.

60
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:38,805
All right.

61
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:41,542
I'm gonna need a complete exam
along with a repeat E.E.G.,

62
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:44,264
an M.R.I. and a cerebral blood flow study.

63
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,118
Come on. Go, people. Go.
(Doctors speak indistinctly)

64
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:49,092
Oh, so nice of you to
join us, Dr. Shepherd.

65
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:52,130
I assume you didn't
plan on making a decision

66
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:54,413
without reviewing the
radionuclide cisternogram.

67
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:56,185
Amy?

68
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,868
Hey... Addie.

69
00:02:59,728 --> 00:03:01,356
So long time no see.

70
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,531
You two know each other?

71
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:06,641
Yes. Uh, yes. I... I was
married to her brother.

72
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:08,397
(Ginsberg) Ah.

73
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:14,750
corrected by chamallow35
www.addic7ed.com

74
00:03:17,116 --> 00:03:17,838
Don't worry.

75
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:20,274
Ginsberg is a beast,
but she's also a genius.

76
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:22,646
Amy, why didn't you
tell me you were coming?

77
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,119
What, and spoil the surprise?

78
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:27,545
- You knew I was here?
- Your name is all over Kayla's records.

79
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:28,609
Amy...

80
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,213
Uh, Amelia.

81
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:32,944
Derek is the only one who
calls me Amy these days.

82
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:35,686
Amelia... but Derek didn't tell me

83
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,365
that you were one of Ginsberg's fellows.

84
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,093
Shocker.

85
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:42,156
Did he, uh, did he even tell you
that I went into neurosurgery?

86
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,903
Is that the Geraldine Ginsberg?

87
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:46,851
My God.

88
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,386
Sam Bennett. You stayed hot.

89
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,285
Amelia Shepherd? (Laughs)

90
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:54,019
Well, the last time I saw you,
you were, like, 14 years old.

91
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:56,130
- What happened?
- Now she is a fancy neurosurgeon.

92
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:59,760
Oh! There you are. Take your kid. Oh.

93
00:03:59,784 --> 00:04:01,840
- Nanny was a no-show.
- Oh, what is it?

94
00:04:01,864 --> 00:04:03,827
I have to get to the
office. He spit up on me.

95
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:05,960
Oh. I'm sending you a dry cleaning bill.

96
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:08,187
Okay, apparently there are a lot of things

97
00:04:08,211 --> 00:04:11,045
- that Derek does not say.
- Oh, no, no, no. He's... he's not mine.

98
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:13,694
He's, uh, he's my boyfriend's son.

99
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,843
Dr. Shepherd.

100
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:18,461
Uh, duty calls. We will talk later.

101
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:19,723
I missed you guys.

102
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:21,296
(Sam) See you later.

103
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:24,300
Hurricane Amelia made good.

104
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:28,685
What kind of family is it where the
black sheep ends up being a neurosurgeon?

105
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:29,574
(Babbles) Wow.

106
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:31,119
- Huh? Oh, what? Huh?
- How you doing, buddy?

107
00:04:31,143 --> 00:04:32,443
Are you gonna be a doctor, too?

108
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,476
Is that what you're
talking about? Huh? (Laughs)

109
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,294
- Yeah, that's Sam. That's Sam. I think you are.
- You're so good with him.

110
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,800
Thank you. Listen, I gotta
get him back to the nanny.

111
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:43,479
- Can you, um, tell Ginsberg I'll be right back?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah. All right.

112
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:45,256
(Babbles) Say bye-bye. Say bye-bye.

113
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,554
See you later, buddy?

114
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,972
Bye. Say bye-bye. Bye. Okay.

115
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:59,198
(Sighs) If she can help her...

116
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:01,408
I know it's asking a lot.

117
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:04,959
But... anything's possible, right?

118
00:05:05,887 --> 00:05:07,798
Wait. You know this isn't your fault?

119
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:10,375
Look. Hey, look at me.

120
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:11,718
Look at me.

121
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:15,582
This is not your fault.

122
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:20,683
It is.

123
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:22,704
But thank you for saying it isn't.

124
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,004
Oh, Charlotte. Good. I'm glad you're here.

125
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:35,953
I... I can't do the sex ed seminar

126
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:38,546
- at the retirement home tonight.
- You are not bailing on me?

127
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,154
Uh, well, not by choice.

128
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:42,091
I have a patient. We're
doing an intervention.

129
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:45,543
- It's a thing. You know, I'm sorry.
- Great. What am I supposed to do about the male point of view?

130
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,319
Well, actually, I have a pitch for that.

131
00:05:47,343 --> 00:05:49,692
You know, uh, what about Cooper?

132
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:54,525
No.

133
00:05:54,549 --> 00:05:55,826
He's great with people.

134
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:59,302
- He's great with 5 year olds.
- Come on, Charlotte.

135
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,203
You've been sitting on
your hands for a month now.

136
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,568
How do you expect to win him back

137
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:05,372
- if you don't just reach out there?
- Who said I wanted to win him back?

138
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:07,319
You are never gonna
have what you really want

139
00:06:07,343 --> 00:06:09,895
if you don't put yourself
out there and go for it.

140
00:06:11,124 --> 00:06:13,308
You really do give crappy advice.

141
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:17,399
No, actually, I'm kinda... brilliant.

142
00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:25,914
Application for the FDA approval

143
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:28,012
for the next stage of my A.L.S. study.

144
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:30,411
Naomi usually reviews the
data before we submit it,

145
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:33,914
but with her gone and leaving
you in charge, it's your job now.

146
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:35,755
Oh, thanks. Looks like a fun read.

147
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,492
Being in charge is not my idea of fun.

148
00:06:37,516 --> 00:06:40,714
I mean, I'm glad that William
finally told her about his A.L.S.,

149
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:43,517
but I didn't know she was gonna run
off to Switzerland to be with him.

150
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:47,197
Any word from them?

151
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:49,227
I heard from Naomi a few days ago.

152
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:51,559
I guess he hasn't seen any improvement.

153
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,122
- Did Naomi say when, uh, they're planning on coming back?
- No.

154
00:06:55,955 --> 00:07:00,103
Then move that to the top of the
pile so they have a reason to.

155
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,917
It's a little out of my
wheelhouse, don't you think?

156
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:12,468
Actually, they're not all that
different from horny teenagers.

157
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:13,908
They got too much time on their hands,

158
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:16,352
minimal supervision, almost zero regard

159
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:18,869
for the consequences of
reckless sexual behavior.

160
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:21,982
- Grannies gone wild.
- It's a real problem, Cooper.

161
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,366
S.T.Ds are spreading through the
elder care community like a brush fire.

162
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,859
The women can't get pregnant.

163
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:30,396
The men are all hopped
up on P.D.E.5 inhibitors.

164
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,703
Everybody's screwing everybody else.

165
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,444
Nobody's taking any precautions.

166
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:37,936
As much fun as that sounds,
it's old people, Charlotte.

167
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,374
I'm a pediatrician.

168
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:43,701
I need a man.

169
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:48,500
A male.

170
00:07:48,524 --> 00:07:49,316
Oh.

171
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,213
The male residents are often uncomfortable

172
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,378
- broaching sexual matters with female medical staff.
- Why me?

173
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:56,095
I'm coming to you as a physician,

174
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:58,639
a fellow partner of this medical practice.

175
00:07:58,663 --> 00:08:01,811
Put away your fear of
age spots. Help me out.

176
00:08:06,205 --> 00:08:09,555
Kayla's repeat E.E.G.
shows diffuse slowing

177
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:12,103
consistent with a
permanent vegetative state.

178
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:13,497
Surgery won't help.

179
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:16,089
Kayla is not a viable candidate.

180
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:17,437
I'm sorry, Eddie.

181
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:20,124
There must... must be something
else you can at least try.

182
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:22,171
She can't just... stay like this.

183
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:23,840
I'm afraid I can't help.

184
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:29,765
What about cannulating
the aqueduct of Sylvius?

185
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,946
- Passing a stent to drain the fluid buildup?
- Dr. Shepherd.

186
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,677
Her C.S.F. studies show a slowing of flow,

187
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:37,783
not a complete obstruction. It could work.

188
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:39,525
- You know how to wake her?
- No, she doesn't.

189
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:43,031
She's referring to an experimental
procedure that has shown very little success,

190
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,848
- and in your wife's case, it will not work.
- I assisted in two of the procedures...

191
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:48,181
- Now is not the time to bring it up.
- So do it or don't, but don't say that it can't work.

192
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:50,473
(Addison)- Amelia...
- This procedure is a bad idea.

193
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,583
- (Eddie) If she thinks that it can work, then we sh...
- She is a teaching fellow who is not qualified to make this call.

194
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:55,491
I graduated top of my class at Harvard.

195
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:57,035
I did my residency at Johns Hopkins.

196
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:59,541
I have done dozens of procedures
in the third ventricle.

197
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:05,354
- I am more than qualified. That's why you hired me.
- Well, clearly I made a mistake. You're fired, Dr. Shepherd.

198
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:14,961
And it goes without saying that just
because the risk of pregnancy is gone,

199
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:18,850
the risk of contracting sexually
transmitted diseases isn't.

200
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:20,913
In fact, in a place of this size,

201
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:23,041
where many of you are so...

202
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,334
So lucky to be enjoying
considerable leisure time...

203
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:34,105
Uh, e... exactly.

204
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:34,733
Yeah.

205
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:38,834
In a situation like this, transmission
rates can be very high, which is why,

206
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,364
if you're going to have intercourse,

207
00:09:40,388 --> 00:09:44,042
we'd like to urge you to
flash back to high school

208
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:47,285
and start using condoms again.

209
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:54,686
Alternatively, um...

210
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,952
There... there are many
ways to be intimate and safe

211
00:09:57,976 --> 00:10:00,036
short of... of actual penetration.

212
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,381
Can anyone name a way to get
pleasure without penetration?

213
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,586
I just feel so awful for the husband.

214
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,670
You know, he's... he's gonna have to

215
00:10:15,694 --> 00:10:18,631
watch her wither away
hooked up to a feeding tube

216
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:20,375
when it doesn't have to be that way.

217
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,918
It's a crime. I mean, it's
a crime of medical omission.

218
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:26,293
In fairness, even Derek
said that this isn't doable.

219
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:29,638
- I e-mailed the scans, and he said it's
a no go.- Derek is just like Ginsberg.

220
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:34,492
I mean, if he hasn't seen it,
it ain't so. This is just new.

221
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:37,071
This is a cutting-edge
surgical procedure.

222
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:41,265
The university of Wisconsin did a
study on a series of 11 patients.

223
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:44,390
I've seen it. I mean, I could do it.

224
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:50,134
I'm just saying... I trained for it.

225
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:50,970
You do realize

226
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:52,620
we're talking about a woman
with three babies inside her?

227
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:55,544
And you realize that Kayla
has a husband and two children?

228
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,972
Addie, what do you think?

229
00:10:57,996 --> 00:10:59,696
I th... (Lucas crying)

230
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,041
Oh. Could we pause for a moment, please.

231
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:04,921
- Here. I'll get it. I'll get him.
- Yeah?

232
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:05,757
Yeah.

233
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:14,666
I should get outta here
and go pick up Vanessa.

234
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,028
(Amelia) Vanessa?

235
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:17,465
His girlfriend.

236
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:20,872
Yeah. (Chuckles) Thank you.

237
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:23,374
Uh, all right. I'll see you guys later.

238
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:25,378
- See you. Have fun.
- Have fun.

239
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:30,418
Okay, so you and Sam...

240
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:32,708
What is with the tension?

241
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:34,787
- There's no tension.
- I was sitting right here.

242
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:36,827
I mean, you barely looked at him.

243
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,434
There was a thing.

244
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,817
- With you and Sam?
- With me and Sam.

245
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,235
And Naomi did not take it well.

246
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:51,114
And now I'm with Pete, and Sam
is with Vanessa, and it's fine.

247
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:54,363
- It's very adult.
- Sounds very messy.

248
00:11:54,387 --> 00:11:56,459
No, it's not, actually. It's great.

249
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,901
My life is working.

250
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:00,993
Addison.

251
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,098
I mean, this is me you're talking to.

252
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:07,964
I caught you with my brother's
best friend and I kept your secret.

253
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:10,026
I mean, you can talk to me.

254
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:12,960
You used to trust me.

255
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,645
I chose Pete.

256
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,780
I choose Pete. He's great. We're great.

257
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:23,401
And... I can't have
kids, and Pete has Lucas.

258
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:25,410
So that's sort of this...

259
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:27,576
amazing icing on the cake.

260
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,371
Except for the fact that...

261
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:32,542
Pete's still in love with
Lucas' mother, which is...

262
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,043
Oh, Addie.

263
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,790
So anyway... cheers.

264
00:12:45,956 --> 00:12:47,578
I missed you.

265
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,294
You know, you were always a
better sister than the ones I had.

266
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,727
And you were way better than my brother.

267
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:58,367
Are things okay between you two?

268
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:01,596
He's the golden child. (Clears throat)

269
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,930
Everything's always okay with him.

270
00:13:06,846 --> 00:13:08,171
That was painful.

271
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:09,714
At least they took some condoms.

272
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:13,798
Ah, do you have any questions
or... or want some more condoms?

273
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,081
Actually, I do have a question for
the gentleman, if that's all right.

274
00:13:19,105 --> 00:13:20,733
The gentleman.

275
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:22,434
Of course.

276
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,140
I'll be waiting.

277
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,908
Hello.

278
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,108
How c... how can I... help?

279
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:39,749
I don't really know how to say this.

280
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:41,562
Uh, it's somewhat embarrassing.

281
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:44,365
No, I'm... I'm... I'm a
doctor. I've heard it all.

282
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:46,407
(Whispers) Come...

283
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:47,485
Okay.

284
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:50,083
Well... Nora and I...

285
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:53,319
we've been dating for several months.

286
00:13:53,343 --> 00:13:56,196
She's a really lovely
woman, really lovely.

287
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,130
And our, uh, our intimate
time has been very good

288
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:02,998
except lately, it's been
difficult for me to...

289
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:04,666
Oh, you know, as men get older,

290
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,205
it's, uh, it's very common
for them to have difficulty,

291
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:10,384
as you say, getting, um... trying to...

292
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:12,101
- No, it's not that.
- Oh.

293
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,320
- I'm still able to perform.
- Oh, good. Good, good, good.

294
00:14:14,344 --> 00:14:18,147
It's just become uncomfortable.
My pelvis is sore.

295
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:19,937
It doesn't want to
move the way it used to.

296
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:23,899
So I don't find myself
getting, uh, in the mood.

297
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:24,714
Oh.

298
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:28,624
So... I was hoping you would have
some pills to help with libido.

299
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:31,606
Given your discomfort, I think
you should have a complete exam

300
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,219
before we prescribe anything.

301
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:35,654
And you can do that? I could
make an appointment with you,

302
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:39,592
- and you could check me out?
- It's... it's my associate's specialty not mine.

303
00:14:39,616 --> 00:14:42,195
But I can bring her up to speed
on everything we talked about.

304
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:43,095
But you really...

305
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:45,594
you really should make an
ap... appointment to see her.

306
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,638
With a lady?

307
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,594
She's no lady.

308
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,657
Y'all kept me up till 3: 00 this morning.

309
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,911
- Oh, oh, God. I'm sorry.
- No, I'm just kidding.

310
00:15:03,244 --> 00:15:03,441
- Sorry, Sam.
- I'm glad she's here.

311
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:05,308
I... me, too. It's nice.

312
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:09,279
I forgot... how much I like
having someone to talk to.

313
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:15,141
You can talk to me.

314
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:17,399
No, I can't.

315
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:18,019
It...

316
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:18,972
Sam, I can't.

317
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:26,579
Amelia?

318
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:30,158
Uh, Eddie wanted to hear
more about the surgery.

319
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:35,605
So we started talking, and one
thing led to another, and, uh...

320
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:36,963
And what?

321
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:39,055
And he asked me to do the surgery.

322
00:15:39,757 --> 00:15:41,667
And I said yes.

323
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:47,835
I can do the surgery and save the babies.

324
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:50,135
I just need you in there
to keep an eye on them

325
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,045
and Sam to maintain the
cardiovascular function.

326
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:54,617
- This can work.
- It's reckless.

327
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:56,177
How... well, how... how would this work?

328
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:58,957
Just for Eddie's sake, I want
to know how this would work.

329
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:01,243
Mm-hmm. I would relieve the obstruction

330
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:03,121
by placing a stent in the aqueduct,

331
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:04,657
and then as the pressure drops,

332
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:06,639
the activity in the
brain stem will return,

333
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:10,116
- and Kayla wakes up.
- And if it works, what state will she be in?

334
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,752
Will she be able to function?

335
00:16:11,776 --> 00:16:15,011
I don't know. But if we don't
do it, we will never know.

336
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:16,354
- I'm against this.
- I am, too.

337
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:18,622
Two neurosurgeons said no to
this, one being your mentor,

338
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:21,257
- the other being your brother.
- Derek looked at an e-mail of a scan.

339
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,413
I mean, he... he didn't
even see the patient,

340
00:16:23,437 --> 00:16:25,641
which ultimately doesn't matter,

341
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:28,480
because Eddie Lindy made a
decision to save his wife.

342
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,479
He asked me to do it, and I can do it.

343
00:16:31,786 --> 00:16:34,314
Now will you give me privileges here?

344
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:37,462
Yes.

345
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:38,930
(Addison) Great.

346
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:41,109
I'll get you an O.R. for tomorrow.

347
00:16:43,174 --> 00:16:45,721
Addison, what are you
going to do to stop her?

348
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:48,754
- Nothing.
- Look, I was wrong. I made a bad call.

349
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:51,002
- Yeah, well... (Chuckles) I admit that.
- But we're both on the same side with this.

350
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:53,344
- We both want to give those babies a chance.
- What, do you really think I can talk her out of it?

351
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:57,676
- I couldn't talk you out of it.
- I think you could try. I think you could try talking to her.

352
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,669
Eddie wants this, Amelia is set, and she
just got sanctioned by the chief of staff.

353
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:04,515
You know her. You know
this is wrong. So stop her.

354
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,016
Have you reviewed the application?

355
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,795
- Not yet.
- Overnight it to Naomi.

356
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,982
Really? You don't think
she has enough on her plate?

357
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:14,493
Why are you rolling around here

358
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:16,496
with this gigantic chip on your shoulder?

359
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:20,156
You should've never told
me about William's A.L.S.

360
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,555
You know, I... I get it.

361
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,365
You're upset that your study
isn't going fast enough.

362
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:24,571
I'll read the application, I'll get...

363
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:26,794
this isn't about the damn application.

364
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:30,659
I slept with Naomi.

365
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:35,135
And... then I told her about William.

366
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,467
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,446
You told Naomi...

368
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,293
(Lowered voice) That William has A.L.S.?

369
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:44,670
Why?

370
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:48,540
I don't know.

371
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:50,563
(Chuckles) I wanted more from her,

372
00:17:50,587 --> 00:17:52,505
and I thought it was the right thing to do

373
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,411
or that she'd be pissed
at him for withholding.

374
00:17:55,435 --> 00:17:57,278
I don't know.

375
00:17:58,554 --> 00:18:00,000
Doesn't matter.

376
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:01,620
She's gone.

377
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:09,448
Prostate cancer?

378
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:14,901
I came in for loss of
libido, pain from arthritis.

379
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,610
(Charlotte) Discovery of prostate
cancer is often an incidental finding.

380
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:21,995
You don't find it if you don't
look, and then it's too late.

381
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,219
What is the treatment?

382
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:28,522
In your case, I recommend
radiation therapy... either external

383
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:31,073
or with an implantable radioactive seed.

384
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:34,102
What about...

385
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:37,477
what about my Johnson?

386
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:39,538
Will it still work after?

387
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:42,993
About half of all patients do
experience erectile difficulty

388
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:45,647
- following radiation.
- And there are no alternative treatments?

389
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:48,252
Well, given your circumstances,
not that I recommend.

390
00:18:48,276 --> 00:18:50,947
But there are things we
can do if impotence occurs

391
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:55,095
as a side effect of the
radiation... injections, pumps...

392
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,865
if I don't have the treatment...

393
00:18:57,889 --> 00:18:59,916
How long do I have?

394
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:04,636
Four, maybe five years.

395
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:12,082
It's been lovely talking to you.

396
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:13,636
Thank you for your time.

397
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,131
Mr. Schmitt.

398
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:19,442
- (Cooper) He's a man, and you're talking about him losing his manhood.
- I get that.

399
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:21,657
No, you can't. You're a woman.
You couldn't possibly know

400
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:23,782
how something like that
would make him feel.

401
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:25,963
And you're a man, so of course you do.

402
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:27,481
Yes, that's right.

403
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:31,501
I mean, is the guy even
making the wrong decision?

404
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:34,549
Prostate cancer's pretty
slow growing. He's 80.

405
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,481
If he wants to live the life
he has left on his own terms

406
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:38,056
and not have to talk to you about sex,

407
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,514
- who are we to tell him no?
- So I should just let him die?

408
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:42,298
- Oh, come on. That's not what I'm saying.
- He's in extraordinarily good health.

409
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:46,451
And this cancer's aggressive.
His gleason level's a 7.

410
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,221
And if he's made it to 80,

411
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:50,665
statistically, he's got a
good shot of making it to 100.

412
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,976
Now he's got a woman that he loves...

413
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,276
that he wants to be able to love.

414
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:56,837
He doesn't want to be
emasculated, Charlotte.

415
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,956
Is it so hard for you to see that?

416
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,481
Are we talking about Oscar
or we talking about you?

417
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:03,616
Excuse me?

418
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,874
Emasculation seems to be
your catch phrase for me.

419
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:07,692
I wasn't talking about you, but truth?

420
00:20:07,716 --> 00:20:10,351
Yeah, you like to be
tougher than everyone else,

421
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,521
- and that makes some people pull away.
- I thought we were past this.

422
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,389
You brought it up.

423
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:17,601
I came to you for help.

424
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,235
- Well, maybe that wasn't such a good idea.
- Clearly.

425
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:28,308
Dr. Shepherd.

426
00:20:28,332 --> 00:20:31,643
Uh, this is Angie and Simon McConnell.

427
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,892
They're the parents that
Kayla's surrogate for.

428
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,510
They wanted to meet you.

429
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,778
Well, I'd... I'd shake your hands, but...

430
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:40,431
Dr. Montgomery told us what's happening.

431
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:42,450
Eddie doesn't want to hear this,

432
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,209
but our babies are barely viable.

433
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,931
- He's well aware.
- We know this is horrible to ask

434
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,485
after all that Kayla's
been through, but...

435
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,620
Please don't do this.

436
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:55,687
We are so close to having our family.

437
00:20:58,553 --> 00:21:00,714
Would you talk with me
outside for a minute?

438
00:21:07,394 --> 00:21:09,059
You thought if I saw the
parents with their sad faces,

439
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,955
what, I was just gonna back down?

440
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,187
Look, I'm doing the right thing.

441
00:21:12,211 --> 00:21:14,451
Not for the babies. The risk is too high.

442
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:17,399
The Addison Montgomery I know would
Wade through fire for a patient.

443
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:18,970
She wouldn't whine about the risks.

444
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:20,442
I mean, she'd go all super woman on me

445
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,054
trying to convince me to do the surgery.

446
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:24,981
What is it? What, you're
settling in your personal life,

447
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:27,745
- so now you're willing to settle with your patients, too?
- I am not settling, Amelia.

448
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:29,138
You have feelings for someone else.

449
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,905
Pete has feelings for his kid's mom.

450
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:34,503
- You say it's great. You don't seem great.
- You have no idea what you're talking about.

451
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:40,067
You seem sad, Addison. And you should be.

452
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,273
Okay, what... you are
way out of line here.

453
00:21:42,297 --> 00:21:44,157
You should want more...

454
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:48,222
More for yourself and more for Kayla.

455
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,544
I can't decide if it's worse

456
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:58,848
if she chooses William and he dies

457
00:21:58,872 --> 00:22:00,405
or if she chooses me and he lives.

458
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:02,824
- You don't want him to die.
- Right, right.

459
00:22:02,848 --> 00:22:05,152
- 'Cause then I gotta compete with his ghost.
- Yeah, but he lives, you gotta compete with all that money.

460
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:08,891
- It's lose-lose either way, right?
- Yes, which is why we're here. Move on.

461
00:22:08,915 --> 00:22:10,334
Move on.

462
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:11,319
Move on.

463
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:20,943
Brings us back to Cooper's dilemma.

464
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:25,825
Would you rather have 10 to 15
years of life or four years of sex?

465
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:27,553
- Sex. Sex.
- That's not the dilemma.

466
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:29,636
The dilemma is how do I continue
working with Charlotte King?

467
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,911
Maybe that's why we're here.

468
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:33,918
- Maybe it's you who needs to move on.
- No, I already moved on from Charlotte.

469
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:37,827
I just can't move away from
her and her emasculating ways.

470
00:22:37,851 --> 00:22:42,880
Right, right, 'cause offering standard medical
treatment to a patient is clearly emasculating.

471
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,738
Hey, you know what? You're
not allowed to defend her.

472
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:46,676
- That's against the rules.
- You guys have rules?

473
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,265
- All guys have rules, dude.
- And he thinks Charlotte has the problem.

474
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:50,376
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

475
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,009
- Hey.
- Don't "hey" me.

476
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:57,706
This is what you guys do for fun, huh?

477
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:01,517
(Wheelchair beeps) What,
so what, now you're leaving?

478
00:23:02,388 --> 00:23:04,680
I'm moving on.

479
00:23:08,165 --> 00:23:10,221
Wow. That guy's a piece of work.

480
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:13,461
What?

481
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,740
I'm just drinking here.

482
00:23:15,764 --> 00:23:17,514
You think it's my fault, too?

483
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:19,992
I was not wrong!

484
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,631
So what you're trying to
say is that I overreacted

485
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:24,878
- and I wanted to pick a fight?
- I'm just drinking here.

486
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:27,432
Oh, man. All right. Another round?

487
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:28,813
No, I'll pass.

488
00:23:28,837 --> 00:23:30,677
Re... why?

489
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,552
I don't need to move on.

490
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:43,373
You're here late.

491
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,024
Am I an emasculating bitch?

492
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,527
I assume this isn't a trick question.

493
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:51,850
(Chuckles) Is this a Cooper thing or...

494
00:23:51,874 --> 00:23:55,290
my sex ed seminar turned up a
patient with prostate cancer.

495
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:58,347
He's old, thinks his life
will be over without sex.

496
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:00,286
He won't even listen to treatment options.

497
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,241
And I think I could help him,
but he won't take my calls.

498
00:24:04,471 --> 00:24:06,398
Cooper thinks I don't understand men.

499
00:24:06,422 --> 00:24:08,449
I think you know he's wrong.

500
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:14,241
We therapists are good at helping
people talk through their problems.

501
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:17,715
I don't like talking.

502
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:20,412
Yeah, well, maybe that's your problem.

503
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,819
Things I tell you are privileged?

504
00:24:25,902 --> 00:24:27,502
Of course.

505
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:35,441
Addison's patient, the one in the coma...

506
00:24:35,465 --> 00:24:38,567
I left her husband alone in the room.

507
00:24:38,591 --> 00:24:39,969
I knew he might...

508
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:41,571
End things.

509
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,062
Why'd you do it?

510
00:24:46,692 --> 00:24:49,010
Well, he was there...

511
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:52,512
Staring at a woman who wouldn't wake up.

512
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:55,074
It seemed so cruel.

513
00:24:55,098 --> 00:24:57,111
I'm backing a surgery to save her.

514
00:24:57,135 --> 00:25:00,053
Three babies are at risk.

515
00:25:01,403 --> 00:25:06,220
I'm putting my faith in some
20-year-old kid because I...

516
00:25:06,244 --> 00:25:08,817
Because you wanted forgiveness.

517
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,778
I want to believe I didn't do the
wrong thing for the wrong reasons.

518
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,871
Well, maybe you did the wrong
thing for the right reason.

519
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,037
This thing with me and Cooper...

520
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:24,415
Why did you push me back to him?

521
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:27,315
Because it's what you want.

522
00:25:38,356 --> 00:25:40,184
Hey. Hey.

523
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:41,914
When did I become the man

524
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:43,445
other men tell their problems to?

525
00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:45,444
Could you tell me that?
Maybe the question is,

526
00:25:45,468 --> 00:25:47,602
when did all the men I know become women?

527
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:51,091
- Because really, it's...
- You know what? Amelia is gonna operate on Kayla.

528
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:54,123
- Okay.
- And she thinks I'm settling. I'm not settling.

529
00:25:54,956 --> 00:25:57,808
- Are you mad?
- Yes, I'm mad. I'm mad.

530
00:25:57,832 --> 00:25:59,769
You want to tell me what it's about?

531
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,259
You said, "I love you, Violet."

532
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:08,849
To me. You said it to me.

533
00:26:08,873 --> 00:26:10,469
I... what? I said...

534
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:11,907
when you were sick and you had a fever,

535
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:15,693
but, you know, I'm...
I'm here babysitting...

536
00:26:15,717 --> 00:26:17,692
Playing peekaboo with your kid, you know?

537
00:26:17,716 --> 00:26:20,563
- And I... you said, "I love you, Violet."
- Yeah, that was six weeks ago.

538
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:23,535
- You been carrying this around for six weeks?
- I'm busy. I have a job.

539
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:26,133
I run a practice. I have
things to do... (Inhales deeply)

540
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:28,452
I'm trying, okay?

541
00:26:28,476 --> 00:26:32,312
I'm trying here, Pete, and
I just need to know if...

542
00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:33,925
if you... don't want to do this.

543
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:35,165
Then... then I won't get too attached.

544
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:37,618
Babe, I will always love Violet.

545
00:26:37,642 --> 00:26:39,764
- She's the mother of my child.
- Okay.

546
00:26:41,194 --> 00:26:42,764
- Good. I'm glad that we cleared that up so...
- No...

547
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:45,849
- so I can get my...
- Okay, Addison, Addison.

548
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:48,378
That doesn't mean I don't love you.

549
00:26:48,402 --> 00:26:50,753
(Chuckles) Mm. I love you.

550
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,545
I love you.

551
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,294
I'm not sitting around waiting for Violet.

552
00:26:54,318 --> 00:26:57,159
I have moved on, and
I'm happy I've moved on.

553
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,098
Yeah?

554
00:26:59,122 --> 00:27:00,241
Yeah.

555
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:05,843
(Laughs) Okay.

556
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:06,717
Okay?

557
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:07,669
Yeah.

558
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:26,372
Are you here to talk me out
of this again? Because...

559
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,255
I'm here for my patients.

560
00:27:32,828 --> 00:27:35,047
Ventriculoscope is in place...

561
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:37,880
And I'm moving down to the aqueduct.

562
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:43,051
So far, so good.

563
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:46,433
You're doing great. Keep going.

564
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,734
All right. I am in the aqueduct.

565
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,554
Guide is in place.

566
00:27:52,578 --> 00:27:54,499
Preparing the stent.

567
00:27:55,815 --> 00:27:57,589
Almost there.

568
00:27:57,613 --> 00:28:00,459
(Monitor beeping erratically) All
right, heart rate's up to 130. 140.

569
00:28:00,483 --> 00:28:03,839
- She's desaturating.
- She's thrown another clot.

570
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,755
I'm gonna keep going.

571
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:08,315
The babies are in distress. Sam.

572
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:10,196
All right. I'll need
time to remove the clot.

573
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,035
Fetal heart rates are in the 80s.

574
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:17,944
Let's prep the belly.
I'm cutting her open.

575
00:28:17,968 --> 00:28:20,785
- Amelia, step back.
- I can do this, Addison.

576
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:24,103
- Just give Sam a chance.
- So long as the babies are in there,

577
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:25,217
she's gonna keep throwing clots,

578
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:26,518
and they will not survive the procedure.

579
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:27,939
I need to deliver the babies now.

580
00:28:27,963 --> 00:28:32,469
Amelia, step back. Scalpel.

581
00:28:38,556 --> 00:28:40,023
Baby number one.

582
00:28:40,047 --> 00:28:42,158
Call NICU. Get three vents
and a central line set up.

583
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:47,832
Baby number two. Come on.

584
00:28:49,952 --> 00:28:51,910
- Why wasn't I paged?
- I have a full team here.

585
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:54,399
I'm an attending on this
case. You could've used me.

586
00:28:56,685 --> 00:28:58,754
Number three. Sam, you're clear to go.

587
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,221
She's floppy. No spontaneous respiration.

588
00:29:01,245 --> 00:29:02,099
I can't feel a heartbeat.

589
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:04,802
- Let me assist you.
- I've got it. Set up an intubation tray.

590
00:29:05,818 --> 00:29:08,007
- Let me help you.
- We are here because of you.

591
00:29:08,031 --> 00:29:10,877
This baby is like this because of you.

592
00:29:10,901 --> 00:29:13,766
The best thing you can
do right now is back off.

593
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,339
Give me an E.T. tube.

594
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:17,765
All right. Suction. She's aspirated.

595
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,388
Is she all right?

596
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:22,278
Okay, I'm almost there.
Almost there. Got it.

597
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,447
Okay. Hold C.P.R. (Monitor
beeping erratically)

598
00:29:26,021 --> 00:29:27,536
There's no pulse. Resume C.P.R.

599
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,960
Okay.

600
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,619
Come on.

601
00:29:36,517 --> 00:29:37,449
Come on.

602
00:29:38,796 --> 00:29:42,628
Come on, baby. Hold on.

603
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:45,702
Good. We got a rhythm... and a pulse.

604
00:29:45,726 --> 00:29:46,754
All right. Let's get her into NICU.

605
00:29:46,778 --> 00:29:48,446
Call an Ecmo unit. This
baby needs to be on bypass.

606
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,456
- Have the techs meet us at the unit. Let's go.
- Is she gonna be okay?

607
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,210
- Sam, you got this?
- Yeah.

608
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,505
(Oscar) Apparently,
you've spoken to Dr. King.

609
00:29:58,529 --> 00:29:59,705
Yes.

610
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,894
I told her that you had the
right to refuse medical treatment,

611
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:05,711
- which is true.
- Thank you.

612
00:30:05,735 --> 00:30:07,447
But I also think it's wrong.

613
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:10,789
Impotence is not an inevitable
side effect of radiation.

614
00:30:11,565 --> 00:30:15,837
She said I have a 50/50
chance of losing function.

615
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:17,941
And if you come down on
the wrong side of that,

616
00:30:17,965 --> 00:30:20,842
- you still have a woman that loves you.
- But I won't be able to love her back.

617
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:23,367
Well, maybe not in the
way that you can now.

618
00:30:24,295 --> 00:30:26,146
But with the help of Dr. King...

619
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,713
It's not the same.

620
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,372
Well, you're right. It would be different.

621
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,434
But these options that Dr. King mentioned,

622
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,287
they don't have to...

623
00:30:38,135 --> 00:30:40,440
They don't make you less of a man.

624
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,887
You know what it's like to get old?

625
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:46,053
People start doing things for you.

626
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,814
They stop letting you
do things for yourself...

627
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,512
Like work a job, uh, or live in a house

628
00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:55,940
or drive your own car down the street.

629
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:58,697
I lost my wife.

630
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:01,007
My kids have lives of their own.

631
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,165
I'm stuck here.

632
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:07,577
But there's one thing that
I can still do for myself,

633
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,846
one thing that makes me feel whole.

634
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:13,027
And I'm not about to
let that be taken away

635
00:31:13,051 --> 00:31:16,296
or... or have it made
uncomfortable or unnatural.

636
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:22,846
Well, I admit I don't know
what it's like to get old.

637
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,056
And when it comes to sex, I get that.

638
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:27,714
And when...

639
00:31:27,738 --> 00:31:29,669
You can't do it...

640
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:33,021
I mean, that is...

641
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:36,423
Look, it happens. It happens to every guy.

642
00:31:36,998 --> 00:31:38,051
I...

643
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:41,428
I was with a woman I loved,

644
00:31:41,452 --> 00:31:43,935
and we were fighting a lot,

645
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:46,897
and, uh... I was stressed out,

646
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:50,974
and that made it difficult... to perform.

647
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:54,696
And it was humiliating.

648
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,364
Oh... it was.

649
00:31:57,388 --> 00:32:01,494
And so I pushed her away
and I treated her badly

650
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:04,029
because I was feeling
like I was less of a man.

651
00:32:04,053 --> 00:32:06,051
I was... I was wrong.

652
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:07,810
I was just wrong.

653
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,664
Mr. Schmitt, I can't promise you

654
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:15,354
that there'll be no side
effects if you do this treatment.

655
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:18,015
But I do know that you'll be alive

656
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:21,874
and you will get to continue to love Nora

657
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,173
for a long time to come.

658
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:26,150
You will be the man in her life.

659
00:32:27,927 --> 00:32:30,134
And that's the most important thing.

660
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,404
Sam.

661
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:43,109
Almost there. 30cc syringe.

662
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:50,862
And clots are dissolving.

663
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,614
Vitals are stabilizing.

664
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:55,680
The rest is up to you, Dr. Shepherd.

665
00:32:58,354 --> 00:33:00,160
I almost killed her, Sam.

666
00:33:01,205 --> 00:33:02,040
And those babies...

667
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,828
they're in Addison's hands.

668
00:33:05,862 --> 00:33:07,682
(Whispers) What am I doing?

669
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:10,697
You're a doing surgery
on a woman's brain...

670
00:33:10,721 --> 00:33:13,532
A-a surgery you said only you could do...

671
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:15,394
A surgery you fought for.

672
00:33:15,418 --> 00:33:18,289
Stop standing there and
start acting like a surgeon.

673
00:33:18,313 --> 00:33:19,458
(Normal voice) You sound like Addison.

674
00:33:19,482 --> 00:33:20,719
No, I sound like you

675
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:23,369
before you started losing
confidence in yourself.

676
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:24,992
Amelia, can you do this?

677
00:33:25,016 --> 00:33:26,084
Can you wake this woman up

678
00:33:26,108 --> 00:33:28,275
and bring her back to her family?

679
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,534
Or were just spouting a bunch of mess

680
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:32,416
because you like to cut?

681
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:38,201
I can do this.

682
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,344
Okay, then. Go. We don't have all day.

683
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:43,737
Adjust the scope. Set up
the catheter for the stent.

684
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:45,564
Let's show your brother
he's not the only Shepherd

685
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:47,186
who can make magic.

686
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:51,009
Attagirl.

687
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:54,625
(Amelia) It didn't work.

688
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:56,152
(Sam) You don't know that.

689
00:33:57,292 --> 00:33:58,028
The other patients

690
00:33:58,052 --> 00:34:00,386
were at least marginally
responsive by now.

691
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,907
I freaked out, Sam.

692
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:03,450
Maybe I took too long.

693
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,162
Maybe I should've stopped.
Maybe Addison was...

694
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:07,761
She's in pain. Is that good or bad?

695
00:34:16,747 --> 00:34:18,378
That's not a pain response.

696
00:34:18,402 --> 00:34:20,031
(Moans) Whoa. Neither is that.

697
00:34:20,055 --> 00:34:21,448
Sweetheart?

698
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:23,079
Pupils are equal and reactive.

699
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,676
- Positive doll's eye response.
- (Eddie) Is she waking up?

700
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,762
Her brain stem reflexes are improving.

701
00:34:29,786 --> 00:34:32,009
- She's waking up?
- (Amelia) She's waking up.

702
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,561
- Baby?
- She's waking up.

703
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:38,035
She's waking up.

704
00:34:39,406 --> 00:34:41,575
Application looks good. I'm sending it in.

705
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,596
Of course it looks good. I wrote it.

706
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:48,862
That was some pretty good game

707
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,366
you were throwing last night.

708
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:53,007
You get her number?

709
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:54,611
Yeah, I got her number.

710
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:56,012
Gonna call her?

711
00:34:57,164 --> 00:34:58,667
(Laughs) I don't think so.

712
00:34:58,691 --> 00:34:59,869
Why?

713
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:01,308
Not interested.

714
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:03,646
Not ready to move on?

715
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:07,255
Naomi will come back. I'm going to wait.

716
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,668
Addison.

717
00:35:15,692 --> 00:35:17,146
It worked. I was right.

718
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,276
No. No, you were not right.

719
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,640
You overreached and you overstepped

720
00:35:20,664 --> 00:35:23,549
and you forced me to take out
those babies way too early.

721
00:35:23,573 --> 00:35:26,428
- They all could've died.
- But they're okay.

722
00:35:26,452 --> 00:35:29,186
They survived. They're
stable, at least for now.

723
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,591
But don't kid yourself.
You got lucky in there.

724
00:35:31,615 --> 00:35:34,051
- No, that wasn't...
- You could be a great surgeon.

725
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:36,228
But right now, you're not half
as good as you think you are,

726
00:35:36,252 --> 00:35:40,331
and I say that as a doctor with
far more experience than you.

727
00:35:46,022 --> 00:35:47,296
But as...

728
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:49,805
your sister-in-law...

729
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:52,694
your former... sister-in-law...

730
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:53,916
look at that.

731
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,775
She's up, she's awake.

732
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:58,096
That's a family, and you did that.

733
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,873
Those kids have a mother.
He's got the woman he loves.

734
00:35:59,897 --> 00:36:05,728
So... celebrate that,
'cause it's a miracle.

735
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:09,661
I'm glad to see you both back here.

736
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:14,237
I decided to go with the treatment.

737
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,194
Nora and I, uh...

738
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:18,576
We just came in to get
some advice for after.

739
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,032
I'm glad. Why don't you
two get settled inside?

740
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,498
I'll be in in a minute.

741
00:36:25,836 --> 00:36:27,099
(Whispers) Thank you...

742
00:36:27,123 --> 00:36:28,853
(Normal voice) For talking to him,

743
00:36:28,877 --> 00:36:30,195
for getting him to come back.

744
00:36:30,795 --> 00:36:34,213
Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry.
I was an ass to you.

745
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:35,726
Yeah.

746
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,694
You were.

747
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,224
But maybe we can work together after all

748
00:36:40,248 --> 00:36:41,652
and not kill each other.

749
00:36:41,676 --> 00:36:45,132
Maybe we can. I'm gonna go do work.

750
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:50,407
Hey, what do you say
to a drink after work?

751
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:53,204
I don't think so.

752
00:36:54,888 --> 00:36:56,858
You afraid to be friends, Cooper?

753
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,829
I'm not afraid.

754
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:01,446
Then what?

755
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:05,506
I don't know.

756
00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:19,102
Hey. Big win.

757
00:37:19,126 --> 00:37:21,695
Kayla's awake. The babies survived.

758
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,316
Good stuff, huh?

759
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:28,251
Look at how much he loves her.

760
00:37:28,851 --> 00:37:30,919
God, they've been through hell.

761
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:34,365
And no matter how it turns
out, they have each other.

762
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:36,258
That's how they got through this.

763
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:42,307
Why didn't you stand up for me?

764
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:43,737
In the O.R. with Addison...

765
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,626
she shut me out, and
you didn't say a word.

766
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,270
What are you talking about?

767
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:53,382
(Whispers, voice breaking) If
you're sleeping with Addison, say it.

768
00:37:56,764 --> 00:37:58,027
(Sighs) If I'm just a pit stop, say it.

769
00:37:58,051 --> 00:37:59,405
- Vanessa, please...
- (Normal voice) Stop wasting my time.

770
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:01,255
Addison is not a factor here.

771
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,066
What does that even mean?

772
00:38:06,927 --> 00:38:08,653
(Whispers) Do you love her?

773
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:15,845
(Voice breaks) That's what I thought.

774
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:27,505
How is it that a woman can
be woken up from the dead

775
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:31,277
- and I can't even be friends with Cooper?
- Addison's patient woke up?

776
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:34,379
- Yeah. Crazy, right?
- Well, maybe you did the right thing after all.

777
00:38:34,403 --> 00:38:38,146
- See, I... I told you.
- No, I did the wrong thing with her, and it turned out okay.

778
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,321
I did the wrong thing with Cooper,

779
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:42,328
- and it turned out badly. (Sighs)
- Still no word from your patient?

780
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:44,450
The opposite. Cooper got him to come in.

781
00:38:44,474 --> 00:38:45,856
He agreed to do treatment.

782
00:38:46,972 --> 00:38:49,202
Then he wouldn't even
have a drink with me.

783
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:51,612
But you worked together
with good results. Right?

784
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:53,450
I mean, it's a start.

785
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:56,318
Stop getting my hopes up.

786
00:38:58,827 --> 00:39:01,565
How long did that man wait
for his wife to wake up?

787
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,778
(Sighs) Ah, he'll come around.

788
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:05,831
In the meantime, you
come have a drink with me.

789
00:39:05,855 --> 00:39:07,520
I mean, you and Cooper
might not be there yet,

790
00:39:07,544 --> 00:39:10,727
but you and I can still be friends, right?

791
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:13,639
(Laughs) Right?

792
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,661
(Laughs) Yes.

793
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:22,955
Hey.

794
00:39:22,979 --> 00:39:24,376
Oh, there you are.

795
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,959
Thank you...

796
00:39:27,983 --> 00:39:30,603
For letting me stay here tonight.

797
00:39:30,627 --> 00:39:32,994
Amelia is at my house, and I just...

798
00:39:33,629 --> 00:39:37,073
Just wanted it to be... us tonight...

799
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:40,706
just you, me... and Lucas.

800
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,230
That sounds good to me.

801
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,223
Hey.

802
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,023
You okay?

803
00:39:45,094 --> 00:39:46,630
Yeah. Yeah.

804
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:47,655
Hi, baby.

805
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:53,335
Kayla woke up.

806
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,807
Wow. That's incredible.

807
00:39:57,782 --> 00:39:59,386
Yeah, yeah, it is.

808
00:40:08,056 --> 00:40:10,154
I love you, too.

809
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:19,042
Hi, buddy.

810
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,072
(Whispers) Hi.

811
00:40:21,096 --> 00:40:23,024
(Normal voice) Okay. Ready? Ohh.

812
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,499
Violet.

813
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:44,565
I, uh, I came straight from the airport.

814
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:45,965
And...

815
00:41:07,523 --> 00:41:09,777
I want to see Lucas.
