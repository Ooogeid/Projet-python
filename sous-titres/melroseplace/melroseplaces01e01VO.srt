1
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:06,967
* I see your dirty face high behind your collar *

2
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:10,934
* What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow *

3
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:16,434
* So you pray to God, justify the way you live *

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,667
* And you take your time *

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,301
* I'm in mine *

6
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:28,067
* Because when I arrive, I, I bring the fire *

7
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:30,468
* Make you come alive *

8
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,633
* I can take you higher *

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,867
* What this is, forgot? *

10
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:37,101
* I must now remind you *

11
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:40,334
* Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock *

12
00:00:41,468 --> 00:00:43,334
* Now the son's disgraced *

13
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:46,500
* He, who knew his father... *

14
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:53,034
Don't even think about it.

15
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:54,667
Of course not, baby.

16
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:57,767
* To the world, to the world, to the world *

17
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:01,101
* And you take your time *

18
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,001
* I got mine... *

19
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,334
So here's the thing.

20
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,600
Your client has gone from

21
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:10,867
inside the Actors Studio

22
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:12,900
to outside of Coco de Ville

23
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:14,867
doing blow with somebody else's boyfriend.

24
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:16,401
We're agents, not baby-sitters.

25
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:18,067
She needs a new publicist.

26
00:01:18,134 --> 00:01:19,533
She needs me.
Ella, Sydney's in trouble.

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,633
She keeps text-bombing me.

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,234
I got to go. Got to lose that leash, dude.

29
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:24,633
It's not like that. I'll call you later.
Hello!

30
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,267
Excuse me. You're my ride.
Here, cab it.

31
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:29,267
* I'll bring the fire, make you come alive *

32
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:31,368
Who wants another shot?

33
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:33,267
* What this is, forgot? *

34
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:34,967
Come on, guys, where's my lobster?

35
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:37,600
People are hungry. I need a lobster.
Right here, Chef. Right here.

36
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,201
Auggie? Auggie?!
Stanley, pick up!

37
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:40,967
Not a good time, bro.
Come back to the penthouse with me.

38
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,034
She seemed totally trashed.

39
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,900
I can't. Marcello's here tonight.

40
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,301
You're the only one

41
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:47,600
who knows how to deal with
her when she's like this.

42
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:50,134
Look, you get there and she's really in trouble,

43
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:52,267
I'll find a way to get out of here.

44
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,967
Carol, I promise you, you're gonna be back

45
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,600
on the dance floor in no time.

46
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:58,767
Thank you, Doctor.

47
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:00,034
What do we got?

48
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:01,934
Got a female, resuscitated with fluid and oxygen.

49
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:03,368
Clearly ischemic changes on the 12 lead.

50
00:02:03,434 --> 00:02:05,234
I'm sending her down to the cath lab now.

51
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:06,401
Well done, Yung. I got it from here.

52
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,134
Hello?

53
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:11,800
Lauren, hey, where are you?
Where else?

54
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:13,067
Is everything okay?

55
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,900
Can you stop by the penthouse when you get off?

56
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,434
I think she's in pretty bad shape.

57
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,267
Oh, I... I can't.

58
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:21,001
I'm working the graveyard shift
at the pharmacy after this, but

59
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:22,533
listen to me, David.

60
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,500
If you can't wake her up,
or if her eyes don't dilate,

61
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:26,967
don't waste time calling me, okay?

62
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:29,700
You got to call 911.

63
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,533
Syd?

64
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,201
Syd?

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,201
You came.

66
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:59,034
I thought I was going to have

67
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:01,234
to be peeling you off the floor.
You're fine.

68
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,533
Not really.

69
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,867
Look, I know this is the last place you want to be

70
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:07,600
right now, but I didn't know who else to call.

71
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:08,800
Something's happened.

72
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:11,201
I've done something really, really bad.

73
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:12,401
What else is new? I'm out of here.

74
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:13,567
David, please don't go.

75
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:14,800
After all your lies?

76
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,134
What do you expect?
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:21,334
I wish you'd known me when I first moved here.

78
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,967
We were like a family.

79
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:24,867
And I know it sounds stupid,
but I thought if I came back,

80
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:26,500
I could start over with a new family,

81
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:27,734
and now everyone's abandoned me.

82
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
If you think you're going to make me

83
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,334
feel sorry for you, it's not going to happen.

84
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:32,567
I know you're angry.

85
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:35,800
And you have every right to be.

86
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:39,134
But, David, what we had together...

87
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:40,667
that was real.

88
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,368
Syd, I have a life right now
that doesn't include you, so...

89
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:45,034
So why are you here?

90
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,867
Your feelings were just as real as mine.

91
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,900
You told me things you've never
told anyone else before.

92
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:51,401
Things that could probably
get you into a bit of trouble.

93
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,434
Are you threatening me?

94
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:02,301
What do you want?

95
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:06,201
Please, David.

96
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:08,468
Just stay.

97
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,134
No, that's okay.

98
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,301
It's okay.

99
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,368
Leave it on. I'm getting up.

100
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:33,401
What's the occasion?

101
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:34,567
You going to come downtown

102
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:36,201
and help teach the Pledge of Allegiance

103
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:37,500
to my first-graders?

104
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,667
Or more likely, is the latest Halo going on sale?

105
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:40,900
Oh, I wish.

106
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:43,533
No. I have to finish editing
the Huey wedding today,

107
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,201
or Bridezilla's going to invade Tokyo,

108
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:48,267
after she squashes me first.

109
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:50,934
And then I have to do this
birthday shoot in Malibuski.

110
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:53,600
Any plans this evening?
Uh, yeah.

111
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,500
Absolutely. You know what tonight is.

112
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,267
What's on the agenda?

113
00:04:57,334 --> 00:05:00,001
Um, what else?

114
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,001
It's the director's cut of Reservoir Dogs

115
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:03,167
at the New Beverly.

116
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:04,334
It's a brand-new print.

117
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:05,600
You know how much I hate Tarantino.

118
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,001
No one said you had to go.

119
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:10,500
No green clovers?

120
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,134
Oh, my God, there's not one green clover in here.

121
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:13,468
That happened yesterday, too.

122
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,468
You've been my boyfriend for how many years now?

123
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,533
What?

124
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,034
Is this a trick question?

125
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:21,167
The answer is five, as of today.

126
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:23,201
Look, I don't expect you to remember arbitrary dates

127
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:26,234
like anniversaries, but last year, didn't you swear

128
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:28,667
on the Lord of the Rings you'd never forget?

129
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:30,101
Right.

130
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,401
That's a fair question.

131
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:33,867
And I'm going to answer it for you right now.

132
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,401
After much quiet contemplation,

133
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:38,667
you know what I've realized?

134
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:41,900
Every day is our anniversary.

135
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:47,567
Jonah, are you

136
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,134
seriously cruising the movie channels

137
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,334
in the middle of this conversation?

138
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:51,567
This TV is totally fragged.

139
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:10,001
* This is the first day of my life *

140
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:13,967
* Swear, I was born right in the doorway *

141
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,334
* I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed *

142
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:25,201
* They're spreading blankets on the beach *

143
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:29,667
* Yours is the first face that I saw *

144
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:35,034
* I think I was blind before I met you *

145
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:38,800
* Now, I don't know where I am,
I don't know where I've been *

146
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:43,533
* But I know where I want to go *

147
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,734
* And so I thought I'd let you know... *

148
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,667
Happy five years, Riley Richmond.

149
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:50,734
Oh, yeah, one more thing.

150
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:54,934
Riley?

151
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,834
Will you marry me?

152
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:17,667
Oh, my God.

153
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:26,034
Sydney.

154
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,101
I should have come back with David.

155
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:43,734
Maybe I could have saved her.

156
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:45,367
You can't blame yourself, Auggie.

157
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:47,233
Hey, what did the police say?

158
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,467
She was stabbed in the doorway,

159
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,901
there was a struggle down the stairs,

160
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:51,101
and she collapsed in the pool.

161
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:52,434
Oh, my God.

162
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,534
I can't believe that girl had
to be the one to find her.

163
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,233
Poor thing. She's lived here,

164
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,434
what, 30 seconds?

165
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,101
I mean, I know Sydney could sometimes

166
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:01,034
rub people the wrong way, but to think

167
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,967
someone could actually stick a knife in her.

168
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:04,267
Yeah, well, Karma sucks.

169
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,934
You stab enough people in the back,

170
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:08,300
and eventually, you get a knife in your own.

171
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,467
Ella, she was just zipped into a body bag.

172
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:11,634
How about showing

173
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:12,967
a shred of respect?

174
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,567
Auggie shouldn't be alone.

175
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:18,134
I'm going to spend today with him, all right?

176
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,134
Yeah.
Um, hello? The Gary

177
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,567
Sarling party? The job that I got you?

178
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,734
Ella, our landlord was murdered.

179
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:25,867
I'm sure the powers that be will understand.

180
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:28,467
Okay, look, Riley, we're not dealing with a room full

181
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:29,634
of first graders here.

182
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:30,967
This is Hollywood.

183
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:33,467
And today your boyfriend has the opportunity

184
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:34,834
to hand over his film

185
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:37,567
to a three-time Oscar-winning producer.

186
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:40,134
Wait. At his daughter's 18th birthday party?

187
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,400
Isn't that a little tacky?

188
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:42,467
It's how things get done.

189
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,667
And don't worry about Auggie, okay?

190
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,701
He's been through a lot worse.

191
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,101
Trust me.

192
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:51,967
Violet, right?

193
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:54,534
Hey, I'm Auggie. I live over here in one.

194
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,001
Um, listen, I'm sorry

195
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:58,101
you had to go through all this.

196
00:08:58,168 --> 00:08:59,801
I've never seen a dead body before.

197
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:02,600
Did you know her pretty well?

198
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,001
Yeah. Yeah. I, uh...

199
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:07,300
I met her four years ago
at a church, St. Patrick's Day.

200
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,500
You must be pretty religious.

201
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:12,300
It was a meeting in the basement.

202
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:13,967
AA.

203
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:15,567
Oh, right.

204
00:09:15,634 --> 00:09:19,034
Yeah. She, um... she busted
me for not wearing green.

205
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:21,333
She was also the one

206
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,567
who convinced me I could be a real chef.

207
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:24,867
I'm sorry.

208
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,534
Auggie, where's David?

209
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:34,467
We know you entered her apartment

210
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:36,367
six hours before she was found dead.

211
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:38,333
I gather you were intimate with the victim?

212
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,534
Look, I'm not saying a word until I get a lawyer.

213
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,534
Smart. Seasoned vet.

214
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,168
Possession of cocaine, couple of assaults.

215
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:48,834
You drove a golf club into your roommate's jaw?

216
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,068
Guess boarding school can get to you, huh?

217
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:51,200
Douche bags get to me.

218
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:52,801
Me, too.

219
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:55,200
Must be nice having hotshot lawyers

220
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:56,367
get you off every time.

221
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:57,867
Daddy's got money, huh?

222
00:09:57,934 --> 00:09:58,934
Wish I had a pops like that.

223
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:00,168
I'm not sure you do.

224
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,233
Look, I didn't kill her, okay?

225
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,767
I didn't even touch her.

226
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:12,434
Looks like you're free to go.

227
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,367
But don't go far.

228
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Hey, O.J.

229
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,400
Look, Ella, I knew you could pull strings, but LAPD?

230
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:29,567
That's huge.

231
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:31,134
What did you tell them?

232
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,534
You couldn't have killed Sydney
because you were at my place.

233
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,701
At 5:30 in the morning?

234
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,400
Everybody's going to think that we hooked up.

235
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,300
Oh, so, it gives them something to Tweet about.

236
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:41,500
What are you doing?
Hey!

237
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,333
You're getting out of here, aren't you?

238
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Let's go.

239
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:50,734
You have the most beautiful eyes.

240
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:53,934
I bet you had the boys running circles around you.

241
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,267
I only had eyes for his father.

242
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,534
Am I not the luckiest mom in the world?

243
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,934
My son flew

244
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:02,367
all the way from Manhattan the
minute he heard about me.

245
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:03,367
Well, I was craving

246
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:05,967
a burrito from El Cholo anyway.

247
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:07,333
Um, in the two seconds

248
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,600
that the cardiologist flew past,

249
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,801
he mentioned it was just a minor heart attack?

250
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:13,267
That's exactly right.

251
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,967
We'll run another stress test today,

252
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:17,300
and you'll meet with a nutritionist, but...

253
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:18,701
your echocardiogram looks

254
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:19,701
pretty close to perfect.

255
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:21,068
See,

256
00:11:21,134 --> 00:11:23,834
you can go back to New York
and finish your big deal.

257
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:25,101
I'm fine.

258
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:27,767
Mom, until you're out of the hospital,

259
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,300
I'm not going anywhere.

260
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:35,001
we may in fact have to kick you out tomorrow.

261
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:37,333
Oh, that's great.

262
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:40,767
Excuse me.

263
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:41,801
Hey, Dad.

264
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,233
You were?

265
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,467
When?

266
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,767
Dad, why didn't you tell me?

267
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:53,534
Hey, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

268
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,534
The whole country is being laid off.

269
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:58,567
Oh.

270
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:01,134
Okay, well, I'll...

271
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,701
I'll just have to cover tuition myself, then.

272
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,534
I... I know it's a lot of money,

273
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,200
but I'll figure something out, Dad.

274
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:14,168
Dad, it's not your fault.

275
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,068
Dad... Dad, stop.

276
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:17,934
Come on, it...

277
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:19,434
Okay.

278
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,634
Okay, I love you, too.

279
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,134
Seeing her in the pool like that...

280
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,701
How could that have happened?

281
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:32,367
I know.

282
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:34,667
It's weird just, like, going about our day right now.

283
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,901
I don't have a choice.

284
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:39,068
Mr. Hammock's covering my class until after recess,

285
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,901
and that's less than 30 minutes.

286
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:44,901
You got me gas, right?

287
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:46,333
Oh, my God, I was about to!

288
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
I totally bricked. I'm sorry.

289
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,400
No, it's my fault.

290
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:50,901
I should know not to ask you

291
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:53,068
a favor on your weekly comics run.
Do you want this?

292
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:54,834
No, I got one. I'm so sorry.

293
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:56,667
Next time, I swear I'll make it up to you.

294
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,101
I'm talking windows washed, tire pressure checked.

295
00:12:58,168 --> 00:12:59,400
I'm even going to throw in one

296
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:00,901
of those little pine tree air freshener things

297
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,233
that goes in your rearview mirror.

298
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,333
Vanilla... that's your favorite, right?

299
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,801
Riley?

300
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,901
What's the deal?

301
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,333
Are you trying to build suspense here,

302
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,267
or are you going for mystery?

303
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,168
What?

304
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:15,767
I asked you a pretty monumental
question this morning.

305
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:17,168
You're just kind of leaving me hanging here

306
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,567
in sort of a big way.

307
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:20,767
I know, I'm sorry.

308
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,101
With everything that's happened this morning...

309
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,600
What's going on, Riley?

310
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,233
Nothing. It's just...

311
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,701
you've been able to mull this
over for who knows how long...

312
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:28,701
Pretty much since,

313
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,967
like, the day that I met you.

314
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,734
Then, how about giving me one day?

315
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:38,901
It's not supposed to be
a homework assignment.

316
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,068
You know... it's a yes or no question.

317
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:43,400
Yeah, a big yes or no question.

318
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:45,400
Um...

319
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:46,834
Look, can we talk about this

320
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:48,567
when I'm not halfway out the door?

321
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:49,634
Oh, sure, yeah.

322
00:13:49,701 --> 00:13:51,701
By all means, yeah, we can talk

323
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:52,934
about this whenever you have time.

324
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:54,934
Whenever is convenient for you. Okay.

325
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,101
* I'm holding on to you. *

326
00:14:03,901 --> 00:14:06,534
So, would you like to tell me

327
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,333
what really happened last night?

328
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,467
I...

329
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:11,901
I went to Syd's to make sure she was okay.

330
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,901
We hit a bottle, I passed out,

331
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:15,934
and when I came to, she was gone.

332
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,001
I'm going to miss her, El.

333
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,367
Well, that makes one of us.

334
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:24,867
Oh, and FYI, in order to back up

335
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:28,068
your airtight alibi, I had to
tell everybody in the building

336
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,101
the same thing I told the police.

337
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:32,634
El, you could get seriously busted.

338
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,001
Why are you doing this?

339
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,701
David, you may be highly volatile

340
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:36,701
and utterly irresponsible,

341
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:38,134
but you,

342
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,168
my friend, you're not a killer.

343
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:42,934
You never could've done this in a million years.

344
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,600
So you lied to the cops

345
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,101
out of the goodness of your heart.
Mm-hmm.

346
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:47,400
Hey, you know what I think?

347
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:48,767
I think that maybe I'm your alibi.

348
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:50,034
Yeah, right.

349
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:51,367
I'm a neat freak, remember?

350
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:54,367
If I would've done it,

351
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:56,600
I wouldn't have been so sloppy.

352
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,634
Geez, Sydney,

353
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:01,867
break and enter much?

354
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,367
How could you, Ella?

355
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:04,801
Isn't that what I should be saying,

356
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:08,168
considering you're sitting
on my couch, drinking my vodka?

357
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,168
Why did you tell David?

358
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:11,567
He never needed to know.

359
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:15,134
David is my friend.

360
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,500
You were sleeping with his father.

361
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:17,901
What was I supposed to do?

362
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:19,101
I thought I was your friend.

363
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,734
You were like a sister to me, Ella.

364
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:23,834
Who got you this apartment, your first job?

365
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:25,400
If it wasn't for me, you would still be wearing

366
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,967
Juicy sweat suits

367
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:30,434
with French tips and a bad dye job.

368
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,068
So, what, that makes me your indentured servant

369
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:33,434
for the rest of my life?

370
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,634
No.

371
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,734
I just never expected you to do that to me.

372
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,701
You have until the end of the month.

373
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:45,068
I want you out.

374
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,400
You're evicting me?

375
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:50,667
You can't do that.

376
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:54,267
Actually, I can do a lot worse.

377
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,400
Just ask the people who used to live here.

378
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:57,934
Oh, what?

379
00:15:58,001 --> 00:15:59,834
Am I supposed to be scared of you?

380
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:02,567
Probably.

381
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:04,500
Because when I'm through with you,

382
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:06,534
you are going to leave L.A. the same way

383
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,901
that you arrived...

384
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,901
a pathetic wannabe.

385
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:13,267
El? El?
Yes?

386
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,500
You having second thoughts?

387
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,634
No, not at all.

388
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,034
You called your dad?
Hell, no.

389
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:25,134
Get in the car.

390
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:36,334
Whatever you told the cops,

391
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:38,001
that woman's a pathological liar.

392
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,001
Who's the liar, Dad?

393
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,167
Were you ever planning

394
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:42,001
on telling me you used to live in my building?

395
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,001
It's a part of my life I choose to forget.

396
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,001
Yeah, I don't blame you.

397
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:47,134
Helping Syd fake her death 11 years ago.

398
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:48,301
I wouldn't want to remember that, either.

399
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:49,533
I'm not the person I was back then.

400
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,533
You haven't changed.

401
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,667
You just cheated on your wife.

402
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:54,667
Hey, you know, I admit, I kind of freaked out

403
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:57,301
when I found out that Syd came
after me to get back at you,

404
00:16:57,368 --> 00:16:59,734
but when she told me how much better I was,

405
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,067
it kind of made it all worth it.

406
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:04,667
I know it hasn't been easy for you.

407
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:06,134
When your mother died,
your entire life changed...

408
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:07,500
Don't talk about my mother.

409
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:09,301
I took you in.
'Cause I'm your son.

410
00:17:09,368 --> 00:17:10,633
Oh, yeah, you spent 13 years

411
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,334
denying I ever existed.
Don't even start with that.

412
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:13,334
Look at you.

413
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:14,834
Patek watch, the Prada.

414
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,633
You're getting your money somewhere.

415
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,900
You selling drugs again?

416
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:20,167
Did your phone ring with me
asking you for anything?

417
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:22,067
No, so leave me the hell alone.

418
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:23,700
And why don't you go call your lawyer?

419
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:24,800
'Cause they're coming after you next.

420
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:27,667
All right, that's enough.

421
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:28,667
Get out.

422
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:31,533
Fine, I'm done.

423
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:43,767
* My lips like sugar, my lips like sugar... *

424
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:47,034
Please tell me that reporter did not beat me here.

425
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:49,067
You think the dead landlord's a good enough excuse?

426
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,900
Uh, maybe if you phrased it a little more delicately.

427
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,767
Anyway, since when is some debutante beach party

428
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:57,067
a newsworthy event?

429
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:59,834
Gary promised his daughter some ink in Us Weekly,

430
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,533
and I am here to make that happen.

431
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
You bring your movie?

432
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,900
Yeah, uh, look, El, I was thinking

433
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:07,201
it might be a better strategy
to have you hand him my film.

434
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:08,533
I mean, Sarling's your client.

435
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,201
Uh, yeah, exactly.

436
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:12,500
I'm his publicist.

437
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,533
He doesn't give a crap about what I think.

438
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,900
You're the artist, Jonah.

439
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:18,134
Own it.

440
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:20,700
Come on, people say no to me on, like, an hourly basis.

441
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:21,934
No one ever says no to you.

442
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:22,967
It's against the laws of physics.

443
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,101
Okay, Jonah, stop.

444
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:26,734
Listen to me.

445
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,067
You are a hugely talented filmmaker,

446
00:18:29,134 --> 00:18:30,734
and I'm not just saying that

447
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,468
because I'm your publicist, manager and agent.

448
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,500
You actually have

449
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:37,900
a point of view, a take, something to actually say.

450
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:38,934
I don't know.

451
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:39,934
You're also

452
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:43,533
the most charming human being I know.

453
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,700
Seriously.

454
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:52,234
All you have to do is just be yourself,

455
00:18:52,301 --> 00:18:55,633
and I promise you

456
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,967
he won't be able to resist.

457
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:02,834
I asked Riley to marry me this morning.

458
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:13,001
* I want to be rich and I want lots of money *

459
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,468
* I don't care about clever *

460
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:17,600
* I don't care about funny *

461
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,434
* I want lots of clothes and I want lots of diamonds... *

462
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,834
Paging Dr. Yung.

463
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,201
I'm sorry, bad time?

464
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:25,234
No, not at all.

465
00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:26,301
How's your mom?

466
00:19:26,368 --> 00:19:28,368
Ready to be released, thanks to you.

467
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,434
I mean, you could teach a class on bedside manner

468
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,267
to most of the doctors around here.

469
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:34,434
I'm sure that'd go over real well.

470
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,700
Hey, can I, uh, take you to dinner tonight?

471
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:39,034
You know, to thank you for everything.

472
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:41,334
Um, that... that's completely unnecessary.

473
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:43,368
I'm just doing my job.

474
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:44,834
But you need to eat.

475
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,301
And something tells me a night
away from cafeteria cuisine

476
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:49,533
might do you some good.

477
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:52,533
Um... if I told you

478
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,867
it was my mom's idea, would that mean anything?

479
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:59,533
So, Ruby, you're finally legal now

480
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,533
and you know what that means.

481
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,301
It's time to party!

482
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:14,567
Cute, huh?

483
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:16,267
Well, get used to looking

484
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:18,767
'cause that's all you're going
to be doing from here on out.

485
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,500
I thought you'd be happy for us.

486
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,500
Jonah,

487
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,101
you're 25 years old,

488
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,167
a split-second away from being discovered.

489
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:27,001
Why even contemplate tying yourself down

490
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:28,867
when you could have any girl that you want?

491
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:29,867
I don't want any other girl.

492
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:31,267
I want Riley.

493
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:33,267
Ooh, I want her.

494
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:34,434
Travis, here.

495
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,700
Now, see, I don't get you, El.

496
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:38,167
That guy at Coal

497
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,334
and then that couple at the farmer's market.

498
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:41,800
Don't you just want to meet someone

499
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:44,167
and settle down and fall in love?

500
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:45,700
You can love someone without declaring yourself

501
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:47,633
exclusive for the rest of your life.

502
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,800
Hey.

503
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:49,800
I love love.

504
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:51,567
I just hate monogamy.

505
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:54,134
So...

506
00:20:54,201 --> 00:20:57,368
was Riley bawling like a newborn when she said yes?

507
00:20:57,434 --> 00:21:01,034
Well... I... I mean,

508
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:03,067
she didn't actually say yes yet.

509
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:04,734
What?

510
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,368
She just needs some-some time to kind of ruminate.

511
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,800
Like 24 hours. No big.

512
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:12,067
I don't know, Jonah.

513
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:14,001
If after five years,

514
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:16,134
Riley even has a millisecond of doubt about you...

515
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:20,500
Says a lot, don't you think?

516
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:25,134
Hey.

517
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,767
You-you're busy.

518
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:27,767
No, no, it's fine.

519
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:28,767
What's going on?

520
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:29,800
The police are still outside.

521
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:31,800
Have you heard anything more?

522
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:34,434
Nothing.

523
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,700
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

524
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:37,834
I just, um...

525
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,600
It's... I talked to my father today,

526
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,633
and, um, he lost his job

527
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,301
a while ago and he didn't want to tell me.

528
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:47,201
H... he missed a couple tuition payments,

529
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:49,567
so now the university is telling me

530
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:52,633
that I have to pay in full by the end of the semester

531
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,667
or they're going to kick me out.

532
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:57,001
Oh, honey.

533
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,533
If you need a loan,

534
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
I'm sure we can all scrape something together.

535
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:01,934
Thank you.

536
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,500
That-that's sweet.

537
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:06,167
I mean, even Ella's being an awesome roommate

538
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:07,434
and covering rent this month,

539
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,900
but tuition... there's... there's no way.

540
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,401
No way.

541
00:22:11,468 --> 00:22:14,500
I worked so hard to get here, you know, Riley.

542
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,500
All my life, all I wanted was to be a doctor.

543
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:20,834
You are going to be a doctor, Lauren.

544
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,900
Apparently not in this lifetime.

545
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:26,934
And how's this for timing?

546
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:28,967
A guy at the hospital asked me out to dinner tonight.

547
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:31,167
Really?
Yeah.

548
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:32,301
You know what though?

549
00:22:32,368 --> 00:22:33,468
After everything that's happened today,

550
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:34,867
I don't even feel like I want to go.

551
00:22:34,934 --> 00:22:36,500
You have to go.

552
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:37,700
You haven't been out in forever,

553
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:40,267
and making out with Auggie doesn't count.

554
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:43,368
Besides, I can see it in your eyes, you like this guy.

555
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:45,500
Yeah, he's cute.

556
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:46,767
But it doesn't matter.

557
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:48,201
I have one outfit

558
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,201
and I have no heels to wear with it.

559
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:52,201
That's why God created neighbors
with the same shoe size.

560
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:55,334
Come on, let's go raid my closet.

561
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:56,767
Riley!

562
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,567
Is this what I think it is?

563
00:23:01,234 --> 00:23:03,667
Oh, my God!

564
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:04,967
Why didn't you say anything?!

565
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:08,500
Well... nothing's really official.

566
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,101
* All night showing, just you and the crowd *

567
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,567
* Doing tricks you never seen *

568
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:17,134
Excuse me. Sorry.

569
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:19,001
* And I bet that I can make you believe in love... *

570
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,633
I have to get back to the office.

571
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,201
Oh, Reservoir Dogs is at the New Beverly tonight.

572
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,700
Huh?

573
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:27,700
There's Sarling.

574
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:29,700
Come here.
What?

575
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,700
This is your shot.
No.

576
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:33,900
I'll do it later.
Go get him now.

577
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:36,301
* And you feel so fly assisting me *

578
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:38,167
* But now it's my turn to watch you *

579
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:40,034
* I ain't gonna stop you
if you wanna crowd my neck *

580
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:41,533
* Talk sexy to me like that... *

581
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,533
Excuse me. Mr. Sarling?

582
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,401
Ah, you want to shoot me, huh?

583
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:46,667
Let me get a toothpick.

584
00:23:46,734 --> 00:23:49,167
Oh, no. I, uh, I just wanted to introduce myself.

585
00:23:49,234 --> 00:23:50,500
Uh, hi.

586
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:51,533
I'm Jonah Miller.

587
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,201
I'm a filmmaker.

588
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,533
Not just a videographer, though.

589
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,567
I... I make real films.

590
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:58,500
Oh, well, good for you.

591
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,567
What have you got there, EX-3?

592
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:02,001
Yeah!

593
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,034
Yeah, this thing is sick. I know.

594
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:05,434
You can shoot 60 frames per second.

595
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,401
Swap this out for the film lenses... it's...

596
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:08,767
Right.
It's just my dream camera.

597
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:09,834
Yeah, I love it.

598
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:14,234
Anyway, uh, it just so happens

599
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:16,967
I have a copy of my short film,
Living In Reverse, on me,

600
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:19,900
and, uh, I was wondering if
I could leave it with you,

601
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:21,734
if it's not too much trouble.

602
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,633
Um...

603
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:26,434
You're kidding me, right?

604
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,434
No.

605
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,434
Not really.

606
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:35,101
I hire you to document my little girl's birthday party,

607
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,167
and you're pimping your student film?

608
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:41,134
Wow.

609
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:42,967
It... it actually...

610
00:24:43,034 --> 00:24:46,600
it won the San Juan Puerto Rico
Short Film Festival.

611
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,834
Oh, hi. Uh...

612
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,468
Stupid.

613
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:52,468
I know it's crazy.

614
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,800
I mean, you'd think after going out for five years

615
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:57,500
I'd say yes before he even finished proposing, but...

616
00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:58,934
I don't know.

617
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:01,167
Suddenly, I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff.

618
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:03,468
Riley, you guys are the most perfect couple I know.

619
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,967
I love him more than anything.

620
00:25:06,034 --> 00:25:08,767
He makes every second of life so fun,

621
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,468
so romantic.

622
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,600
The guy has a box of Legos in the closet

623
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,667
that he still plays with. He's an artist.

624
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:16,434
He needs inspiration.

625
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,101
He watches Saturday morning cartoons

626
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:20,134
before going off to play laser tag with David.

627
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:21,134
I just thought

628
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:23,134
if I waited long enough,

629
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:26,368
eventually he'd, you know, become a grown-up.

630
00:25:26,434 --> 00:25:28,034
I mean, how's he supposed to take care

631
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:29,867
of a family if sometimes it feels like

632
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:31,934
he can't even take care of himself?

633
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:42,500
Hey.

634
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:44,267
Bro, what the hell happened, man?

635
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,934
Your dad come down and bail you out?

636
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:47,001
Ella told the police

637
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:48,533
I was with her all night.

638
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,567
Yeah, well, you weren't. I know.

639
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,700
Guess she's a better friend than I thought.

640
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:55,034
David, what went down after you got there?

641
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:56,334
I don't know.

642
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:58,201
What do you mean you don't know?

643
00:25:58,267 --> 00:25:59,234
I blacked out.

644
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:02,234
I... You know how I get.

645
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:03,800
Aug, what if I did it?

646
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:05,834
What?

647
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:08,500
I was so pissed at her.

648
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,667
Yeah, but you would never hurt her.

649
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,667
Why not? I've hurt plenty of other people.

650
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:13,468
Look, man, I want answers, too.

651
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:15,067
I want someone to pay
for what they did to her.

652
00:26:16,134 --> 00:26:18,067
You didn't do this.

653
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:20,067
Okay?

654
00:26:20,134 --> 00:26:21,368
You're not a murderer.

655
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,234
Well, at least I have my health.

656
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:29,700
That guy's movies blow anyway.

657
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:31,767
I say let's eat his food and drink his liquor.

658
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:33,434
Excuse me, videographer.

659
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,334
I need you to get a shot of all the presents

660
00:26:35,401 --> 00:26:36,934
in the pool house.
Carmen arranged them

661
00:26:37,001 --> 00:26:38,001
in the number 18.

662
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:39,301
She is so creative.

663
00:26:39,368 --> 00:26:40,633
Okay, Mrs. Sarling.

664
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,301
Now this is filmmaking.

665
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,834
Yeah.

666
00:26:54,234 --> 00:26:56,201
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

667
00:26:57,767 --> 00:26:59,468
Shh, shh.

668
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:14,684
Hey, honey.

669
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,383
Our son is so excited you're
putting him to bed tonight.

670
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,650
Yeah, I'm st a mile away.

671
00:27:19,717 --> 00:27:22,584
Tell Noah I'm going to read him
Goodnight Moon when I get home.

672
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,917
I love you.

673
00:27:23,984 --> 00:27:26,584
I love you, too.

674
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:38,584
What are you doing here?

675
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,084
I wanted to let you know
that David and I are through.

676
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:42,650
It's over.

677
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:45,851
It was a stupid thing to do.

678
00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:47,851
I... I was lashing out,

679
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,350
trying to make you jealous. I'm sorry.

680
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:52,417
I'm not thinking clearly.

681
00:27:52,483 --> 00:27:55,417
ChalK it up to mixing pain medications.

682
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:56,851
Hmm.

683
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:58,584
It's been 11 years since your accident, Syd.

684
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,951
You need help.

685
00:28:00,017 --> 00:28:02,017
I need you.

686
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:05,951
No.

687
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,984
I'm a happily married man. You knew that.

688
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:11,084
If you were happy, you wouldn't have called me.

689
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:15,318
You definitely wouldn't have
been sleeping with me.

690
00:28:15,383 --> 00:28:18,318
It was a mistake.

691
00:28:18,383 --> 00:28:20,318
I was wrong.

692
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:21,517
And I'm sorry.

693
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,318
It was a terrible thing to do to you.

694
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:25,584
Michael.

695
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:29,917
I care about you too much in a bad marriage.

696
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:32,784
If you're not going to talk to your wife,

697
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:34,017
someone else has to.

698
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:46,383
I was always trying to make

699
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,550
my father happy.

700
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:49,184
He'd take me to the football games,

701
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:52,218
and I was bored out of my mind,
t I pretended I loved it.

702
00:28:52,284 --> 00:28:54,684
To this day, when he's around,
I wear a Bengals sweatshirt.

703
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,684
I'm sorry, alcohol makes me ramble.

704
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,517
No, I love to hear you ramble.

705
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:00,851
Most of what I hear

706
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:03,817
all day are people trying
to get something from me.

707
00:29:03,884 --> 00:29:09,017
The Lauren Yung story, it's fascinating.

708
00:29:09,084 --> 00:29:11,817
How about... how about dessert back at my hotel?

709
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:14,017
It's no pressure, it's just that they heard

710
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:15,383
I was in the market for properties,

711
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,251
so they... they upgraded me into this suite at is...

712
00:29:18,318 --> 00:29:20,851
sweet.

713
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:22,350
Look, Toby,

714
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:24,017
I really like you.

715
00:29:24,084 --> 00:29:25,483
But...

716
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,051
I feel like we barely know each her.

717
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:29,684
And I'm... I'm not a first date kind of girl.

718
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,584
I'm not normally a first date kind of guy,

719
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,417
but a second date isn't in the cds.

720
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:38,184
I fly home tomorrow afternoon.

721
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:40,350
You'll be back to see your mom, right?

722
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:42,584
No, I'm... I'm moving mom back to New York.

723
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,318
Oh.

724
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:47,750
Okay.

725
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,784
Um,

726
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:50,617
I have

727
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:51,851
kind of a radical

728
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,584
idea he.

729
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,051
How radical?

730
00:29:55,117 --> 00:29:58,117
Well, I couldn't help but get a peek at that fax today.

731
00:29:58,184 --> 00:29:59,417
Look,

732
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:01,717
I... I know that school isn't cheap.

733
00:30:01,784 --> 00:30:03,817
I also know that as far as first dates go,

734
00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:05,450
this one is pretty great.

735
00:30:05,517 --> 00:30:08,051
So, um,

736
00:30:10,117 --> 00:30:13,750
to the tuition fund of a future superstar doctor.

737
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:15,617
Say, uh,

738
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:17,784
$5,000?
What?

739
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:18,884
What are you talking about?

740
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,684
Ok, I... I know it sounds crazy,

741
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,251
but if you think about it, we both win.

742
00:30:23,318 --> 00:30:25,450
I can't believe this is happening to me.

743
00:30:25,517 --> 00:30:28,284
I'm at the Doheny, room 747, like the plane.

744
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,984
Just think about it.

745
00:30:30,051 --> 00:30:31,650
What's the rush?

746
00:30:31,717 --> 00:30:33,218
The lady said we could have some Pinkberry.

747
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:34,817
I'll buy y a Popsicle on the way home, all right?

748
00:30:34,884 --> 00:30:36,017
Just hurry up.

749
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:36,917
Hey, buddy.

750
00:30:36,984 --> 00:30:38,617
I thought before you left,

751
00:30:38,684 --> 00:30:40,417
I'd give you a few career tips.

752
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:41,650
Hey, do you mind?

753
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:42,884
There's dessert inside.
Whatever you want.

754
00:30:42,951 --> 00:30:44,917
re, thanks.

755
00:30:44,984 --> 00:30:46,784
I love your movies.

756
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:49,450
Thanks.

757
00:30:49,517 --> 00:30:52,417
So...

758
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,117
where's the video?

759
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:57,450
Uh, look, Mr. Sarling, I promise, you have nothing

760
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:59,417
to worry about. Great, then give it to me.

761
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,417
It's just not that simple.

762
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,117
See, 'cause it's on the same video card

763
00:31:02,184 --> 00:31:04,951
as your wife's birthday toast
and then Ruby blowing

764
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:07,184
out the candles, so if I give this to you,

765
00:31:07,251 --> 00:31:08,817
then that's not going to be on the DVD,

766
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:10,218
and then your wife's gonna frak out.
Damn it.

767
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:12,151
No, Mr. Sarling, I swear,

768
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:15,218
as soon as I'm done editing,
this is going to be deleted

769
00:31:15,284 --> 00:31:16,684
into the digital ether.

770
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,151
Your short film.

771
00:31:18,218 --> 00:31:19,184
I'll buy it right now.

772
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:21,517
Ten grand.

773
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:22,584
Wha...
Okay.

774
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,617
Twenty.

775
00:31:23,684 --> 00:31:24,450
You... you haven't seen my film.

776
00:31:24,517 --> 00:31:26,184
Fine. Fine. Twenty-five.

777
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,884
Come on, right now,

778
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:29,483
we close it, that is the end of it.

779
00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:32,483
What are you doing out here?y!

780
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,383
I'm coming, hon.

781
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,051
And I'll hire you to write the feature, okay?

782
00:31:36,117 --> 00:31:37,417
$100,000 against three.

783
00:31:37,483 --> 00:31:38,550
Gary!

784
00:31:38,617 --> 00:31:40,318
Gary, Ruby's about to leave with her friends.

785
00:31:40,383 --> 00:31:43,151
We have to give her her present. Now.

786
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:44,650
Call me.

787
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:47,584
Come on.

788
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,251
Remember to use that Lady Gaga song.

789
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,750
Wow, look at you.

790
00:32:05,817 --> 00:32:07,650
I've never seen you out of those doctor clothes.

791
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,417
I... I love those heels.

792
00:32:09,483 --> 00:32:11,584
Yeah, they're... they're not mine.

793
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,917
Is everything all right?

794
00:32:13,984 --> 00:32:15,917
I said something stupid, didn't I?

795
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:17,284
No. No. No, you didn't.

796
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,350
I... I'm just...

797
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,117
Are you okay?

798
00:32:22,184 --> 00:32:24,117
No. No, I'm not.

799
00:32:24,184 --> 00:32:26,717
Came home and I found my landlord brutally murdered,

800
00:32:26,784 --> 00:32:28,984
and then I find out that I can't afford medical school.

801
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:30,218
And to cap off the evening,

802
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:31,517
I think I just had the most disturbing

803
00:32:31,584 --> 00:32:32,784
dating experience of my life.

804
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:34,218
Oh, God.

805
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:36,717
My mom told me to always carry
pepper spray in Los Angeles.

806
00:32:36,784 --> 00:32:39,051
It's nothing like that.

807
00:32:39,117 --> 00:32:40,917
Well, then what is it?

808
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:49,383
I went out to this fancy dinner with this guy, Toby.

809
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,450
He's funny, successful...

810
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:53,450
incredibly handsome.

811
00:32:53,517 --> 00:32:54,550
That doesn't sound disturbing.

812
00:32:54,617 --> 00:32:56,117
That sounds like my wish come true.

813
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:58,117
Mine, too.

814
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:01,617
Until the part where he offered to pay me $5,000

815
00:33:01,684 --> 00:33:02,917
to have sex with him.

816
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:04,650
No way.

817
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:06,151
Is that not completely creepy?

818
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,984
And the joke is: if he'd been a little patient,

819
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:10,417
he probably could have talked me
into it without paying a dime.

820
00:33:10,483 --> 00:33:12,984
$5,000.

821
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:17,318
I mean, that's a lot of money.

822
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:21,784
Yeah, but I'm... I'm not a prostitute.

823
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:23,483
Yeah, I know, totally.

824
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,851
It's just you ended up not getting the guy

825
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,517
or the money.

826
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,251
Okay, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.

827
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:35,851
Here I am trying to give you some stupid advice.

828
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:37,350
It's fine.

829
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:41,184
It's just... it's just something I'd never do.

830
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:42,318
Me neither.

831
00:33:42,383 --> 00:33:45,383
You and me, we're good girls.

832
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,650
It's just not as fun.

833
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:51,650
It's better.

834
00:33:51,717 --> 00:33:52,817
Good night, Violet.

835
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:55,084
Night.

836
00:34:02,383 --> 00:34:04,318
Hey.

837
00:34:04,383 --> 00:34:07,817
There are six messages on our
voice mail from some agent...

838
00:34:07,884 --> 00:34:10,017
Marc Korman at Endeavor.

839
00:34:10,084 --> 00:34:12,450
Gary Sarling wants to buy Living In Reverse,

840
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,817
the agent thinks you're about
to blow up, and he wants

841
00:34:14,884 --> 00:34:15,884
to sign you immediately.

842
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:18,717
Yeah, I'm sure he does.

843
00:34:18,784 --> 00:34:20,684
Wait, Jonah, I don't get it.

844
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,984
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

845
00:34:22,051 --> 00:34:23,717
You know, I don't know, Riley.

846
00:34:23,784 --> 00:34:25,218
As of this morning, I wanted a lot of things.

847
00:34:25,284 --> 00:34:27,051
Nothing's really working out
the way I pictured it, though.

848
00:34:27,117 --> 00:34:30,318
See, Gary Sarling...

849
00:34:30,383 --> 00:34:32,483
he hasn't even seen my film.

850
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,417
He just wants to buy it so he can shut me up.

851
00:34:34,483 --> 00:34:36,151
Shut you up?
Yeah.

852
00:34:36,218 --> 00:34:39,251
I was fortunate enough
to walk in on the movie mogul

853
00:34:39,318 --> 00:34:41,350
making out with his daughter's best friend.

854
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,784
Oh, Jonah.

855
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:44,951
Yeah,

856
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:47,417
so he offered me $100,000

857
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:50,350
to write a screenplay based on my film.

858
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:51,584
What are you going to do?

859
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,218
Well, I called him on the way home

860
00:34:53,284 --> 00:34:57,350
to tell him that I would do it.

861
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:01,284
Seriously?

862
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,584
You really did that?

863
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,951
Yeah, I did.

864
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:06,784
I did do that, Riley, for you.

865
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:09,350
So you could see that I'm more than

866
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:10,817
just some guy who's more worried about getting

867
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:12,383
his graphic novels than putting gas in the car.

868
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:15,917
So you'd see that I am really serious

869
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:18,450
about making films and about...

870
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:20,851
about my career, and most importantly, about you.

871
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:23,151
It's gonna sound ridiculous,

872
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:25,784
but I thought that if I said yes

873
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:29,017
to Gary Sarling, then you would say yes to me.

874
00:35:33,184 --> 00:35:36,151
I just couldn't do it.

875
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:38,251
That's not the way I want to start my career,

876
00:35:38,318 --> 00:35:40,218
and it's really, really not the way

877
00:35:40,284 --> 00:35:42,617
that I want to end up with you.

878
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,617
So, if I got to do...

879
00:35:47,684 --> 00:35:49,318
a thousand more

880
00:35:49,383 --> 00:35:52,684
Bar Mitzvahs before I'm discovered,

881
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,717
then... so be it.

882
00:35:54,784 --> 00:35:57,450
That's great.

883
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:04,084
So, I screwed up... again?

884
00:36:04,151 --> 00:36:05,951
No.

885
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,318
I did.

886
00:36:10,383 --> 00:36:15,350
For hesitating even one second before I said yes.

887
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,284
You are a grown-up...

888
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,750
an adorable grown-up,

889
00:36:22,817 --> 00:36:26,184
who I want to grow very old with.

890
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:29,550
I do, Jonah Miller.

891
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:33,017
I do, I do.

892
00:36:50,284 --> 00:36:54,917
Sydney was complicated, to say the least.

893
00:36:54,984 --> 00:36:57,984
I'm sure we all witnessed her difficult side,

894
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:00,784
but I was lucky enough to witness the good.

895
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:04,550
Because when no one else was
there for me, Sydney was.

896
00:37:04,617 --> 00:37:06,917
That's why I'd like to make a toast to Sydney.

897
00:37:06,984 --> 00:37:09,784
A woman who was never boring,

898
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:13,084
a person who...

899
00:37:13,151 --> 00:37:14,717
I will never forget.

900
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:17,517
I'll miss you, Sydney.

901
00:37:17,584 --> 00:37:19,550
To Sydney.

902
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,984
I too would like to make a toast.

903
00:37:24,051 --> 00:37:26,450
Um, every time I passed Sydney,

904
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:27,784
she'd always say the same thing to me.

905
00:37:27,851 --> 00:37:29,550
She'd say "When are you gonna get off your butt

906
00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:31,017
and slap a diamond on that girl's finger?"

907
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,550
So, it's with much irony

908
00:37:33,617 --> 00:37:34,717
that on the day she died,

909
00:37:34,784 --> 00:37:37,784
my life actually begins.

910
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:40,784
We're getting married, guys.

911
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:42,383
What?
Yeah.

912
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,884
* Go get your wounded heart *

913
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:47,817
* Seeing spiders, I'm told *

914
00:37:47,884 --> 00:37:49,817
* They never lie *

915
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:51,417
* Go get your brother love *

916
00:37:51,483 --> 00:37:54,251
* Go get your losing hand *

917
00:37:54,318 --> 00:37:56,051
* Seeing fire *

918
00:37:56,117 --> 00:37:59,884
* I'm told it never burns *

919
00:37:59,951 --> 00:38:01,851
* I want it all *

920
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:04,184
* I pull you back *

921
00:38:04,251 --> 00:38:07,851
* I want it all *

922
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:10,684
* Cry baby *

923
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,750
* Cry baby, cry *

924
00:38:12,817 --> 00:38:15,417
El.

925
00:38:15,483 --> 00:38:17,084
Hmm.

926
00:38:17,151 --> 00:38:19,084
Hey, since everybody thinks
we already did it anyway,

927
00:38:19,151 --> 00:38:21,251
what do you say we make it a reality?

928
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:23,251
Ooh, tempting.
Mmm.

929
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:25,218
But let's not confuse fact with fiction.

930
00:38:25,284 --> 00:38:26,750
* How I could just kill a man *

931
00:38:26,817 --> 00:38:28,284
Hey, Auggie.

932
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,417
You okay?

933
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:31,318
I've seen better days.

934
00:38:31,383 --> 00:38:33,151
Me, too.

935
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:35,218
You maybe want to get to go grab some coffee?

936
00:38:35,284 --> 00:38:36,483
I think that

937
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,450
cafe around the corner's open late.

938
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:41,251
* Cry baby... *

939
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:44,318
You know, I... I think I'm just gonna crash.

940
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:47,318
Rain check?

941
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:57,717
* This is the world that we live in *

942
00:38:57,784 --> 00:39:02,251
* I feel myself get tired *

943
00:39:02,318 --> 00:39:08,151
* This is the world that we live in *

944
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:20,284
* Well, maybe I was mistaken *

945
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,350
* I heard a rumor *

946
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:27,318
* That you quit this day and age *

947
00:39:27,383 --> 00:39:32,851
* Well, maybe I was mistaken *

948
00:39:34,884 --> 00:39:37,284
* Bless your body, bless your soul *

949
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:41,483
* Pray for peace and self control *

950
00:39:43,851 --> 00:39:47,017
* I gotta believe it's worth it *

951
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,851
* Without a victory *

952
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:54,884
* I'm so sanctified and free *

953
00:39:54,951 --> 00:39:59,517
* Well, maybe I'm just mistaken *

954
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:08,218
* Lesson learned *

955
00:40:08,284 --> 00:40:11,450
* And the wheels keep turning *

956
00:40:16,218 --> 00:40:19,084
* Bless your body, bless your soul *

957
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:23,350
* Reel me in and cut my throat *

958
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:28,284
* Underneath the waterfall *

959
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,784
* Baby, were still in this *

960
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:33,951
* Oh, yeah *

961
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:38,917
* This is the world that we live in *

962
00:40:38,984 --> 00:40:42,784
* I feel myself get tired *

963
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:49,084
* This is the world that we live in *

964
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:54,151
* I had a dream that I was falling *

965
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,483
* Falling, falling *

966
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,550
* Down *

967
00:41:03,884 --> 00:41:08,517
* There's no next time around *

968
00:41:08,584 --> 00:41:14,151
* A storm wasted its water on me *

969
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:18,517
* But my life *

970
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:22,483
* Was free *

971
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:37,517
* This is the world that we live in. *

972
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,584
