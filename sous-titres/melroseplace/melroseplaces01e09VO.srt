<i>Previoulsy...</i>

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,128
Hi, I'm Ella Sims,

3
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,463
junior publicist.

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,841
You are a hugely talented filmmaker.

5
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,926
We're getting married, guys.

6
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:11,677
You called your dad?

7
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,929
Get in the car!

8
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,766
Look at you. Paddock watch, the Prada.
You're getting your money somewhere.

9
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,893
If you need to go out
and take what's not yours,

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,860
there's something
missing in your life.

11
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:22,939
- I'm concerned about finances.
- I work it out.

12
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,776
You're gonna be going to a party
tonight. The client's gonna love you.

13
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,945
There's a hostess
that just quit at Coal.

14
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,821
I could put in a good word for you.

15
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,285
Oh, my God, Sydney!

16
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,579
- Did you know her pretty well?
- I met her 4 years ago.

17
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,582
She was the one who convinced
me I could be a real chef.

18
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,292
Who needs Coal?

19
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,085
You are way too good for that place.

20
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,047
I kissed someone last night.

21
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,759
I had the same exact reaction when
I found out you kissed Auggie.

22
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,844
So, where do we go from here?

23
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,024
You're...

24
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,109
incredible.

25
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,612
Thank you, so are you.

26
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,370
What's the rush?

27
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,207
You booked two hours.
Now I gotta go.

28
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,501
But I want you to stay.

29
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,629
Thousand dollars if
you stay till sunrise.

30
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,926
I'm all yours.

31
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,480
You're sure they're not
gonna be home all day, right?

32
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,817
We've done this before,
and we've had no problems, right?

33
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,070
You have nothing to worry about.
I'll see you soon, bye.

34
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,447
Dad stick you with
the graveyard shift again?

35
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,324
Part of the joy of med school.

36
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,410
What about you? Where
are you off to so early?

37
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,703
Oh, Hugo's.

38
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,204
Waffles and eggs.

39
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,461
Long night of
making people feel better?

40
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,963
Endless night, actually.

41
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,216
Let me see, we had two
car accidents, gunshot wound,

42
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,844
and a kidney failure
all in one shift.

43
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,597
You look exhausted.

44
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,600
- Are you okay?
- I'm still standing.

45
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,893
Yeah, for now.

46
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,354
Dr. Mancini's got us coming in
for rounds in two hours.

47
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,775
So I have like 90 minutes
uninterrupted sleep ahead of me.

48
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,448
Take care of yourself.

49
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,551
Did we forget to set this clock back

50
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,762
or are you, like,
an hour late to class?

51
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,723
I have teachers' conferences today.
I don't have to go in early.

52
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,975
Oh, right, forgot.

53
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,772
You gonna work on your
treatment for Kendra?

54
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,151
Yeah, probably.

55
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,829
Where are we, Jonah?

56
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,043
I have no idea.

57
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:16,536
We're supposed to be engaged
and we're kissing other people?

58
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,499
God, I wish none
of this had ever happened.

59
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,973
Too bad in real life
there's no "undo" command.

60
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,058
I was thinking,

61
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,643
I should maybe take a road trip.

62
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,730
Like hike Joshua Tree or something.

63
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,485
I was gonna say the opposite,
that we go together somewhere.

64
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,699
What was that?

65
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,367
Police! Get inside!
Now, now!

66
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,995
Go! Go! Go! Go!
LAPD! Go! Go! Go!

67
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,371
Get in there!

68
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,622
Watch them!

69
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,167
Do either of you happen to know
where Auggie Kirkpatrick might be?

70
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,377
- Why?
- We found the murder weapon.

71
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,339
- What does that have to do with Auggie?
- It was a knife with his blood on it.

72
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,407
Mr. Kirkpatrick's wanted for murder.

73
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,114
Balibal,Dark_Chii

74
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,516
Just-In, Luoleilina

75
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,726
Ps!Ko^^, SirHill

76
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:11,690
WoLF971

77
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,647
What would a boy do
without his balls?

78
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,359
Whatever you have planned
for the rest of the day, cancel it.

79
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,681
Do I get a why?

80
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:21,667
I got a heads-up
from corporate in New York

81
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,698
and they wanna a
video conference at noon.

82
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,201
They want a full rundown on how I'm
making the L.A. office more profitable.

83
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,329
And you want me to be your wingman?

84
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,790
- Talk you up to the New York brass?
- Done and done.

85
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,917
I've never needed a wingman.

86
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,670
What I need for you to do is
take over the lunch meeting

87
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,881
I was supposed to have
with Franz Keppler.

88
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,425
You do know who he is, right?

89
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,179
The German wunderkind who makes
indecipherable indie movies

90
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,806
that I would rather pluck
my eyes out than sit through.

91
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,183
I wouldn't open with that.
Franz is white-hot right

92
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,936
now that he's about to start rolling
on the Bruckheimer blockbuster.

93
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,190
I need you to convince him
that he needs WPK.

94
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,151
A couple of problems.

95
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,030
I know nothing about his movies,
I speak zero German

96
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,033
and lederhosen is not my style.

97
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,452
New York's gonna ask me what
gets I have lined up.

98
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,579
I'm gonna tell them I'm about to
bring Franz Keppler into the WPK fold.

99
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,625
Don't make your boss a liar.

100
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,628
All right, no need to get
your jock strap in a knot.

101
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,338
I'm on it.

102
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,429
Are you sure you know where it is?

103
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,891
I got it written down.

104
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,142
1:00, right?

105
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,935
But where is the place again?

106
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,562
Pasadena Tile

107
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,980
on Colorado.

108
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,691
I wanna kiss you good-bye, Mommy.

109
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,902
Sorry, Miss Vanessa, he's so fast.

110
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,738
You want a kiss, you got it, pal!

111
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,323
I want Mommy.

112
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,202
Oh, come here.

113
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,829
Be a good boy today, okay?

114
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,788
We'll be back later.

115
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,167
Thanks.

116
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,186
Come right back.

117
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,021
Hola, Leticia.

118
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,232
- ¿Como estas?
- I do not feel good about this.

119
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,485
It's fine. I'll have him
back in a of couple hours.

120
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,196
There's my little munchkin!

121
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,532
Ready for an adventure
with your big brother?

122
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,826
- I can get in so much trouble for this.
- But you won't.

123
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,122
Because no one has to find out.
All right, you ready? Let's hit it, pal.

124
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,041
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

125
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,668
Come on.

126
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,592
I may not be CSI,

127
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,260
but when your blood ends up
on the murder weapon

128
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,805
along with the victim's blood...
you're usually guilty.

129
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,474
It doesn't prove anything.

130
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,351
What other proof do you need?

131
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,853
It's Auggie.
He'd never murder someone.

132
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,272
Are you forgetting about
the night he told

133
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,149
you about stabbing
a guy in a bar fight?

134
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,235
That was self-defense.

135
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,864
And look, obviously you're
not exactly Mr. Objective when

136
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,240
it comes to judging him.

137
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,575
I wouldn't put you anywhere
near that jury box.

138
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,120
I'm just stating facts here, Riley.

139
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,081
One being that right after
they found that knife,

140
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,250
our good friend Auggie seemed to

141
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,294
very conveniently disappear.

142
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,713
He goes on surfing trips
all the time, you know that.

143
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,632
How do you know he's surfing?

144
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,052
I saw him loading his board
and his bag into his van.

145
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,347
He could just
have been going to the beach.

146
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,143
How do you know he's on a trip?

147
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,982
Did he tell you
he was going somewhere?

148
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,821
If you know where he is,
you have to tell the police.

149
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,367
Why? So they can arrest him and
convict him of a crime he didn't commit?

150
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,993
It happens all the time.

151
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,538
They also convict people
for aiding and abetting

152
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,747
a fugitive.

153
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,460
We all know you have this

154
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,920
uncanny ability
to see the very best in people,

155
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,007
but is that really worth
going to prison for?!

156
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,636
You have no idea he's even innocent.

157
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,888
Yes, I do.
I know Auggie.

158
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,723
Oh, really? You know Auggie?

159
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,560
I get that you're
friends and you talk.

160
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,687
But think about it. Honestly.

161
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,065
How well do you really
know that guy?

162
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,994
- I gotta go.
- Where?

163
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,162
Ella's having some kind
of emergency.

164
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,706
Of course she is.

165
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,001
You better hurry.

166
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,045
This might actually turn out to be
a blessing in disguise.

167
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,631
I was talking about
spending some time apart.

168
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,174
Why not start today?

169
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,224
There's one rule that
we cannot break, no matter what.

170
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,103
It's that we cannot leave this place

171
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,814
until we have gone on
every single ride.

172
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,441
- You got it?
- Got it!

173
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,358
Good.

174
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,570
Why can't we do this every day?

175
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,739
That's a little complicated, bud.

176
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,118
Auf Wiedersehen, Mr. Miller.

177
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,621
That kind of means "good-bye."

178
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,206
What's this whole emergency?

179
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,752
So there's this German
guy that I'm trying to woo...

180
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,505
and I know you know all
about German cinema.

181
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,883
This doesn't sound remotely
like an emergency.

182
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,260
The real emergency's happening
at our building right now.

183
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,386
What happened?

184
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,266
The cops raided Auggie's
apartment this morning.

185
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,561
They found the murder weapon
with Auggie's blood on it.

186
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:49,899
What?

187
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,442
Oh, my God.

188
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,945
It's terrible.

189
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,281
Is Auggie in jail?

190
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,868
He's doing what every
innocent person does.

191
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,703
Disappear into the ether.

192
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,207
Course the only person who thinks
Auggie's actually innocent is Riley.

193
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,795
Little disagreement
between the two lovebirds?

194
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,507
I'm getting a little tired of her
obsession with him, that's all.

195
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,133
I don't blame you.

196
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,760
But there is nothing you can do

197
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:21,263
except help your neighbor who's
not a murderer... me.

198
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,766
So, wait.
Who's this Aryan mystery man?

199
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,143
Franz Keppler.

200
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,854
We're having lunch
with him at Coal in 45 minutes.

201
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,400
He just won the Palme d'Or.

202
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,360
He totally revitalized
European cinema.

203
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,155
If this is a joke,
it's cruel by even your standards.

204
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,615
There's no joke.

205
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,616
There's just one teeny-weeny catch.

206
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,369
You're not the filmmaker,

207
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,163
you are Jonah Miller
the new publicist at WPK.

208
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,415
I don't know a thing
about publicity.

209
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,501
You don't have to. You talk his movies,
I'll talk publicity.

210
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,129
We'll be fine.

211
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,630
It'll be fabulous.

212
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,637
Mr. Walters here presented
with mitral valve prolapse

213
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,764
of the anterior leaflet.

214
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,599
What were the possible
complications?

215
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,021
Endocarditis

216
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,566
makes the surgery more difficult.

217
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,608
And...?

218
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,986
And, um...

219
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,196
Anyone.

220
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,324
The patient might have
extensive calcium deposits

221
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,286
on the valve leaflets,
which ups the surgery risk factors.

222
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,664
That's it. Very good.

223
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,833
All right, that's all.
I'll see you all tomorrow.

224
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,002
<i>Dr. Levy to Oncology.</i>

225
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,422
Just a minute, Miss Yung.

226
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,218
- Have you been studying?
- Of course.

227
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,679
When I chose you,
you said you could handle the grind.

228
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,848
- I can handle the grind.
- Really?

229
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,767
Because there's a long list
of students

230
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,852
who'd give their right arm
for your spot.

231
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,395
Don't blow it.

232
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:07,994
Oh, my God.

233
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,582
Good times, huh?

234
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,628
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I need one more little favor.

235
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,678
Our agreement is very clear.

236
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,639
I send you your weekly payments,

237
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,766
and you stay the hell away
from me and my family.

238
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,018
But I had to come see you in person.

239
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,811
You won't return my phone calls.

240
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:37,066
You know what? This sick little
game of yours is starting to piss me off.

241
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,567
I'm supporting another child.

242
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,778
Don't think I'm not appreciative.

243
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,614
Your money has been so helpful.

244
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,075
I just bought some awesome
new furniture.

245
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,911
So let me guess,
you need more money.

246
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:49,870
Right?

247
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,373
I need a lawyer.

248
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,917
I have a court case coming up.

249
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,209
What for?

250
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,713
The cops came after me for some
little thing I did up in Oregon.

251
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,216
And now, they're saying
I, like, resisted arrest.

252
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,717
It doesn't even matter.

253
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,554
But I figure,
you're this big-time doctor,

254
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,390
you probably have tons
of important patients,

255
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,933
including lawyers.

256
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,977
You expect me to find
a lawyer for you?

257
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,062
The person who's blackmailing me?

258
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,689
Go to hell.

259
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,692
Actually, it's your marriage
that goes to hell

260
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,735
once I send your wife our little

261
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:22,986
video.

262
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,488
People like you,

263
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,241
they don't get away with this
kind of behavior.

264
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,076
It comes back to haunt you.

265
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,662
You would know.

266
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,996
My court date's

267
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,415
December 11'th.

268
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,833
Your choice, Doctor.

269
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,918
Either get me a lawyer,

270
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,461
or I get you divorced.

271
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,594
Enjoy your lunch!

272
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,559
There's our Bavarian buddy.

273
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,979
My gosh, I can't believe I'm about
to have lunch with Franz Keppler.

274
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,691
Control the drool, and remember,
you're a publicist, not a fan boy.

275
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,775
I know.

276
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,027
Franz?

277
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,486
Oh, hello.

278
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,866
Caleb didn't tell me how
beautiful the publicist would be.

279
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,827
He is a man of few words.

280
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,039
Anyway, this is my associate,
Jonah Miller,

281
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,333
who also happens to be one

282
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,501
of your biggest fans.

283
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,589
It's true. Das Lied is one of my
favorite thrillers, like, of all time.

284
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,007
Thank you. Come, let...
you know, let's sit.

285
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,928
Yeah, with Das Lied I was,
trying to make a movie

286
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,306
that was visually striking,

287
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,516
mesmerizing.

288
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,190
Kind of like your eyes.

289
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,065
Danke schön.

290
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,775
So, congratulations

291
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,486
on the Bruckheimer movie.

292
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,238
No doubt that it is going to be a hit,
but we need to make sure that

293
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,783
you are getting the accolades
that you deserve.

294
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,993
It's not just a Matt Damon movie.

295
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,662
This is a film by Franz Keppler.

296
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,831
You're confident.

297
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,291
It's what I do.

298
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,668
I like that.

299
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,220
Ella is an amazing publicist.

300
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,888
- Thank you.
- She's the best.

301
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,765
And one of the most inventive

302
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,809
filmmakers of his generation
deserves the best.

303
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,562
Uh, but, Franz,

304
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,315
your use of shadows...

305
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,568
it makes Fritz Lang
look like an amateur.

306
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,737
You're too kind, Jonah.

307
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,572
Which must make you

308
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,117
the naughty one.

309
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,665
You nailed it, Franz.

310
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:41,250
Ella is naughty.

311
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,002
Why do you think I proposed to her?

312
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,838
Couldn't let her get away.

313
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,508
Like I would ever stray from you.

314
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,177
I'm so sorry.

315
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,513
I had no idea.
You were a couple.

316
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:58,100
- I thought you were colleagues.
- We just try to keep a low profile.

317
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,893
You know, keep it professional.

318
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,395
But in reality,

319
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,814
he cannot keep his hands off of me.

320
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,234
I don't blame him.

321
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,863
Okay, boys, let's relax our trousers

322
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,614
and get down to business.

323
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,368
Like the juggernaut, otherwise
known as Franz Keppler's career.

324
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,119
Cheers.
Cheers.

325
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,245
<i>Vive la Franz!</i>

326
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,338
Unbelievable, huh?

327
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,339
Murder?

328
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,924
Auggie?

329
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,384
I know.

330
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,720
He would never do
something like this.

331
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,682
I guess the police are coming up
empty in their investigation, so...

332
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,060
They're trying to pin it on Auggie?

333
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,519
They're desperate.

334
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,853
And stupid.

335
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,525
Listen, Violet, I wanted to talk
to you about Auggie.

336
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:49,651
What about him?

337
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,863
You guys work together.
Has he been...

338
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,157
I don't know, acting strange lately?

339
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,658
He's been Auggie.

340
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,702
I mean, yeah, he got in that fight

341
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,329
with Marcello, but
Auggie had no choice.

342
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,123
What fight with Marcello?

343
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,459
Last night.
Auggie finally got fed up

344
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,878
with Marcello taking credit
for his recipes,

345
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,713
and he taught him a lesson.

346
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,548
Is Marcello okay?

347
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,299
Broken nose, couple of broken ribs.

348
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,427
Auggie may have lost his job,

349
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,055
but Marcello got what he deserved.

350
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,307
I took care of Auggie
last night, though.

351
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,230
Auggie and I have become...

352
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,068
intimate.

353
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,741
Look over there!

354
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,372
How about getting one of those?

355
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,960
Yeah one of those.
The blue one.

356
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,630
That was so fun!

357
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,132
We were way up there, huh?

358
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,675
I think I saw my house.

359
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,194
I think I saw the North Pole.

360
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:58,178
And Santa Claus was shoveling
his driveway.

361
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,805
He only comes in winter.

362
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,764
What?

363
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,268
Can you win me a prize?

364
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,314
I'll win you a prize.
You got it. Come on, pal.

365
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,734
Wait, one second, Noah.

366
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,990
Leticia, what's up?
They're not home, are they?

367
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,534
Okay, good.
No, we're fine.

368
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,203
Get down from there, pal.

369
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,915
We'll be home in, like, an hour.

370
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,292
And the good news is you won't
have to feed him for a week.

371
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,795
He's eaten his weight in corndogs.

372
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,597
You okay, buddy?

373
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,056
You're gonna be okay.

374
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,481
We're here, buddy.
We're gonna get some help, all right?

375
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,191
I'm looking for Lauren Yung.

376
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,860
She's a med student,
part of Dr. Mancini's team.

377
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,112
- ER's this way.
- All right, buddy.

378
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,949
When you called you left out the
part about how this happened.

379
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,702
It doesn't matter.
He said that his arm hurts real bad.

380
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,954
Okay, just relax.

381
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,257
Pulled some strings, we can
get him in straight away.

382
00:20:08,382 --> 00:20:10,291
- We can take it from here.
- Wait over there.

383
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,836
Unless you're a guardian,
it's not really policy.

384
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,754
- I'm not leaving him...
- It's okay.

385
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,925
Check his vitals, get me a chem 20,
do an A.P. and a lateral, left arm.

386
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,929
He also threw up in the car ride over.
It's probably all the junk he ate.

387
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,055
- Could also be a concussion.
- What?

388
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,933
- I didn't see him hit his head.
- I'm going to take care of him.

389
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,477
Add a CT scan.

390
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,899
My dad doesn't know
that I took Noah.

391
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,736
He's about to.
They're calling him as we speak.

392
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,912
Maybe you shouldn't have
anything to do with this.

393
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:42,227
If you want to step out
and have another doctor come in...

394
00:20:42,352 --> 00:20:44,493
The child needs medical care.
I'm giving it to him.

395
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:53,627
Auggie, it's me.

396
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,922
I just want you to know
I'm totally here for you,

397
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,050
and I know it's only been 24 hours

398
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,177
since we last saw each other, but...

399
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,599
I miss you.
Call me.

400
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,566
Nice furniture.

401
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,027
Love what I've done with the place.

402
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,407
- Did you find me a lawyer?
- Oh, didn't need to.

403
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,450
I checked out the
details of your hearing,

404
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,797
and it turns out I know the judge
that's scheduled to preside over it.

405
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:31,164
- What does that get me?
- I actually met Judge Davis

406
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,605
the day I did a quadruple
bypass on Mrs. Davis.

407
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,005
Needless to say, the good
judge was extremely grateful.

408
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,632
That's perfect.

409
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,426
Eh, that depends.

410
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:46,138
See, Judge Davis has
the utmost trust in me,

411
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,390
and I'm your character witness,

412
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,101
- either way.
- What do you mean?

413
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,147
That I can tell him
that the Violet Foster I know is

414
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,691
a poor, disinherited orphan
and should have

415
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,776
the justice system smile upon her.

416
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,278
- Thank you.
- Or...

417
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,280
I can tell him that Violet is

418
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:07,116
a sick and twisted menace to
society that should be locked up.

419
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,828
Your move.

420
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,583
Fine.

421
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,176
And now we're done.

422
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,721
Your days of milking
me for money are over.

423
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,766
Now, if even

424
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,767
one single frame of that video

425
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,144
shows up anywhere, I call

426
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,313
Judge Davis

427
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,733
and he throws your devious
little ass in jail.

428
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,823
Who says doctors don't make
house calls anymore?

429
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,539
So tell me,

430
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,333
how did you guys meet?

431
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,086
At my apartment building, actually.

432
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,090
Well, he had a
girlfriend at the time,

433
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,344
but as soon as I saw
that adorable smile,

434
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,721
I just knew.

435
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,603
You know what? I'm thinking of
doing a romantic comedy,

436
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,440
and looking at you two,
I have found my inspiration.

437
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,318
Did you hear that?

438
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,862
- I did.
- It's nice to meet you.

439
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,198
And Ella, my dear...

440
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,784
- Franz, oh, very sweet.
- Very nice to meet you.

441
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,996
I'm going to put some serious
thought into working with WPK.

442
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,874
Jonah, hang on to her tight, yeah?

443
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,876
She is worth keeping.

444
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,878
Auf Wiedersehen, Franz.

445
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,089
Call me at the office tomorrow.

446
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,256
Ja, ja.

447
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,138
Always knew you were destined
to win an Oscar someday,

448
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,849
but I never thought
it would be for acting.

449
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,887
Bravo.

450
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:56,726
I had to come up
with a way to stop Franz

451
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,188
from slipping you the wiener
schnitzel before salad was served.

452
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,150
I was talking about pretending
to be a publicist.

453
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,696
Jonah, hi, it's me, Ella.

454
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,577
You actually think some horny
director would ever faze me?

455
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,413
I deal with guys like that
all the time in my sleep.

456
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,416
I think that you put
your arm around me

457
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:23,253
and pretended to be my beau because
secretly it's what you wanted

458
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,380
- since the day that we met.
- You are drunk.

459
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,715
Aren't you?

460
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:33,013
Funny thing is,
is that you and I as a couple...

461
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,348
completely natural.

462
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,058
Franz totally bought it.

463
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,312
After drinking an entire vat of wine,
I think he'd buy anything we sold him.

464
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,190
Jonah, come on.

465
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,650
Give us a little bit of credit.

466
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:49,154
You and I at that lunch
were completely compatible.

467
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,156
More than I can say about
some real couples I know.

468
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,702
And by that, you mean me and Riley?

469
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,371
It's pretty obvious that the two
of you have been having problems

470
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,916
since the day
you asked her to marry you.

471
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,753
It's not exactly my definition
of compatibility.

472
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,630
Maybe it's time

473
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:10,466
that you explore
some other options,

474
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,970
the operative word
being "explore."

475
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,936
Okay, uh, what's that
supposed to mean?

476
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,898
Well, Hotel Andaz is
right down the street.

477
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,274
I can...

478
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,112
cancel the rest
of my meetings, you can clear

479
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,406
the rest of your day,

480
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,994
and you can finally experience
what you've been missing...

481
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,371
all this time.

482
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,837
Oh, Jonah, come on.

483
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,466
You can't tell me that you haven't
at least fantasized about the idea.

484
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,051
I'm engaged.

485
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,053
Remember that minor little detail?

486
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,654
What does "engaged" even mean...

487
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,491
giving your college
sweetheart a ring

488
00:25:59,616 --> 00:26:01,476
because you're insecure
about your career

489
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,604
and you're hoping that she'll
bring you some sense of security?

490
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,647
Is that why you think
I proposed to Riley?

491
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,024
Absolutely.

492
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,903
Jonah, you guys are nothing alike.

493
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,448
Okay, look, we might be going
through some growing pains right now,

494
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,493
but it's nothing that's not normal
for any couple planning a wedding.

495
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,144
Nothing about you is normal,

496
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:23,164
and everything about her
is painfully normal.

497
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,001
- El, you are so out of line right now.
- Am I?

498
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,168
You...

499
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,838
are this brilliant,

500
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,173
passionate, creative type who seeks

501
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,884
adventure and, and,
an-and excitement,

502
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,513
and Riley is this mellow,
laid-back schoolteacher

503
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,182
whose idea of a fun night
i-is grading spelling tests.

504
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,436
Okay, look... say whatever you
want about me, I don't care.

505
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,147
Don't you ever bad-mouth Riley.
If you have a problem

506
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,525
with the fact that I'm in love with her,
then it's just that... it's your problem.

507
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,360
The only reason

508
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,529
I am even out here all day
alone with you is because

509
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,949
Riley trusts me, and I trust Riley.

510
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:01,598
That's the reason she's the
person I'm meant to be with,

511
00:27:01,723 --> 00:27:03,496
the only person I'm
meant to be with.

512
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,389
<i>To: AugKirk Hey, U there?</i>

513
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,111
<i>AugKirk Yeah. What's up.</i>

514
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,078
<i>To: AugKirk What u doing in Mexico?</i>

515
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,790
<i>AugKirk Struggling.</i>

516
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,129
<i>Riles17 Struggling with...?</i>

517
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,798
<i>AugKirk I've ruined my life.</i>

518
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,470
<i>To: AugKirk What did you do?</i>

519
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,308
<i>AugKirk I'd rather not say.</i>

520
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,928
Don't worry, he'll be
good as new in no time.

521
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,682
I can keep an eye on him if you
want to go to the commissary.

522
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,851
The coffee's semi-toxic,
but it's caffeinated.

523
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,561
No, I'm good.

524
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,439
Oh, my God, Noah.

525
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,357
It's okay.
Mommy and Daddy are here now.

526
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,442
Sweetie...

527
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,527
- How you doing, buddy?
- Mommy?

528
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,907
Can I... is it all right
to hold him?

529
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,451
He really shouldn't be moved.
He's got a,

530
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,830
a hairline fracture to the ulna
and a mild concussion.

531
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,379
You are never to come near
Noah again, is that clear?

532
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,930
If you ever pull something
this reckless again,

533
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,183
so help me God,
I will press charges.

534
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,434
The last thing I ever wanted
was for him to get hurt.

535
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,831
What were you thinking?

536
00:29:31,956 --> 00:29:33,938
I wasn't. I just wanted
to spend time with him.

537
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,274
I wanted to be a brother.

538
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,859
Okay? I screwed up.

539
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,111
I love him.

540
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:47,743
You have an odd way of showing it.

541
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,335
Good work, Yung.

542
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,559
I'm in here.

543
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:20,985
You okay?

544
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,074
No, not really.

545
00:30:32,037 --> 00:30:33,497
Who are you calling?

546
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,124
No one.

547
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:37,585
Yet.

548
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,508
It's Auggie, huh?
You're calling to warn him?

549
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,219
I IM'd him.

550
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,684
I meant it when I said that I wasn't going
to have anything to do with Auggie, but...

551
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,185
He's your friend.

552
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,479
I get it.

553
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,358
You believe in him,
so I believe in you.

554
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,321
If you don't think he did it,
I don't think he did, either.

555
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:08,491
I trust you, Riley,

556
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:12,161
because, in the same exact situation,
I'd want you to trust me.

557
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,876
The Ims Auggie sent me back...

558
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,503
they were kind of scary.

559
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,718
Maybe I don't know him
as well as I thought.

560
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,763
Maybe he did hurt Sydney.

561
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,850
But, if he did do it,

562
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,436
and he ends up hurting someone
else because I kept my mouth shut,

563
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,104
I couldn't live with myself.

564
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,941
At the end of the day,

565
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,151
you were right.

566
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,862
It's not up to me to decide
whether or not he's innocent.

567
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,663
Whatever you decide to do...

568
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm here for you.

569
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,769
Detective Rodriguez, please.

570
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,869
Ah, Simms, there you are.

571
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,496
Oh, God.

572
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,539
You brought me in here
to talk football?

573
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:39,957
Franz Keppler just called.

574
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,585
He's coming to WPK.

575
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,589
Not only did he love your pitch, but
he especially loved your... boyfriend?

576
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,217
Invite me to one
of your slumber parties...

577
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,552
we'll have a pint
and share boyfriend stories.

578
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,429
He said his name was Jonah.

579
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,682
That wouldn't happen
to be Jonah Miller,

580
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,684
the director of the Anton V EPK

581
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,770
- and the Boomkat video savior, would it?
- The one and only.

582
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,023
I'm impressed, Simms.
He's absolutely adorable.

583
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,859
Yeah, he is, but, um...

584
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,277
But nothing.

585
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,613
He's brilliant, he's charming.

586
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,740
He's a very talented director.

587
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,534
You know something?

588
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,494
You've actually got good taste
in men.

589
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,205
I have very good taste
in everything, Caleb,

590
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,582
but the truth is,
is that Jonah is engaged.

591
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,961
You're a bad girl, aren't you?

592
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,547
I'm not a home wrecker,

593
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,674
and Jonah is not my boyfriend.

594
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,843
Okay? He's just a friend

595
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,971
who was protecting me
from Franz's groping.

596
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,599
He's a hot-blooded,
heterosexual male.

597
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:42,478
Engaged or not, if he's pretending to
be your boyfriend, then he wants to be.

598
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,355
Oh, well, then, that's his problem.

599
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,317
Because Jonah Miller
is so not my type.

600
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,569
Please.

601
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,960
Sorry. Did I get your book wet?

602
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,879
That's okay.
I've dropped my fair share

603
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,757
of books in the deep end.
That's what hair dryers are for.

604
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,341
You know, I was thinking.

605
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,469
Making rent every
month is turning out

606
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,220
to be harder than I thought.

607
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:20,101
And you're a med student, so money's
got to be tight for you, too, right?

608
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:21,683
That's putting it mildly.

609
00:34:21,808 --> 00:34:24,520
I was wondering if you and Ella

610
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,398
would be interested
in having a new roommate.

611
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,734
I don't take up too much space,

612
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,944
and I promise I don't
talk in my sleep.

613
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,696
We would have so much fun together.

614
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:37,325
You know, Violet,
I'd love to, but, um,

615
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,285
I-I don't think Ella's going to be

616
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,455
too psyched about sharing the
bathroom with one more person.

617
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,040
Yeah, I get it.

618
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,751
I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask.

619
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,760
One shot of tequila.

620
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:56,761
Or 12.

621
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,139
I take it you've had about
as good a day as me.

622
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,058
Oh, no, I've had worse.

623
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,768
Especially since the police finally
figured out who murdered Sydney.

624
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,688
What?
Who did it?

625
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,857
Have you two been trapped
in a vault all day?

626
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,943
The police were here this morning

627
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,444
raiding Auggie's apartment.

628
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,282
The murder weapon
had Auggie's blood all over it.

629
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,785
They're searching for him
as we speak.

630
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,787
Oh, my God.
That is so messed up.

631
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,498
I'm as broken up
about it as you are.

632
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,546
Did you guys hear about Auggie?

633
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,798
We're, like, in shock.

634
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,466
Oh, I bet.

635
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,511
I mean, Riley, you know Auggie
better than all of us.

636
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,514
All those morning jogs together.

637
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,391
Who knew that you
were running with the devil?

638
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,434
He's not the devil.

639
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:49,689
Right...

640
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,026
Look, I'm, um...

641
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,113
I'm sorry about earlier today.

642
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,032
I have no idea what got into me,

643
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,161
except for three bottles
of Pinot Grigio.

644
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,454
That much wine, and I go
straight for shock value.

645
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,541
Well, don't worry about it.

646
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:09,917
I won't.

647
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,295
I'm going to go chase my buzz.

648
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,216
Can I have a word with you, David?

649
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,763
Sure.

650
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,329
If you're here for David Beatdown
Part Two, can we get on with it?

651
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,750
Actually, uh... no.

652
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,252
No, I'm not here for that.

653
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,968
I stand by what I said
at the hospital.

654
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,970
What you did was reckless.

655
00:37:03,803 --> 00:37:06,515
- You cost Leticia her job.
- It's not Leticia's fault.

656
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,977
Most importantly,
you put Noah's life in danger.

657
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,857
You don't think that I feel
terrible about that?

658
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,735
Do you think that I wanted
to hurt him?

659
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,695
He's my little brother.

660
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,960
I just want to say that,

661
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,715
well, I appreciate...

662
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,051
that you wanted
to spend time with Noah.

663
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,186
Anyway...

664
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:23,175
I just wanted to say thank you
for, you know, today.

665
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,721
It's pretty obvious you're
going to be an amazing doctor.

666
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,098
Just doing my job.

667
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,518
I've known a lot
of docs in my day, and...

668
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,730
most of them didn't care
nearly half as much as you do.

669
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,277
I think you're the one who cares.

670
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,028
You know?

671
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,573
Seeing you with Noah

672
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,992
like that today...

673
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:53,039
I didn't think you could be
that devoted to someone.

674
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,083
Pretty easy to be devoted
to a kid like Noah.

675
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,004
It's the other
million things in my life...

676
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,422
that's a different story.

677
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,636
You know, David, um...

678
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,431
you're obviously smart.

679
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,682
Obviously.

680
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,809
Seriously.

681
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,062
All you have to do, David,

682
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,023
is decide what you want to do
with your life and apply yourself.

683
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,984
Just make sure that, whatever it is,

684
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,736
it's legal.

685
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,115
You should know that that little
hobby of mine, it's over.

686
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,869
Good.
I'm glad.

687
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,415
'Cause it was going to be really
awkward calling the cops on my neighbor.

688
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,960
Do you want to know why it's over?

689
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,671
Why?

690
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,760
'Cause I don't want you to ever
look at me the way you did

691
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,761
when you caught me
coming out of that house.

692
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,555
Ever.

693
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,270
I want you to look at me the way
you're looking at me now.

694
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,339
Are you okay?

695
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,883
Did I cross a line?

696
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,136
No, it's... it... it's not you.

699
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,524

00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:47,945
