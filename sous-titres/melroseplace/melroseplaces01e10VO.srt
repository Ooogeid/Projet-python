1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:01,875
<i>Previously on Melrose Place</i>

2
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:03,753
I'm Ella, junior publicist.

3
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:05,308
<i>Jonah, you are</i>

4
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:06,547
a hugely talented filmmaker.

5
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:07,609
Anton V

6
00:00:07,734 --> 00:00:08,909
wants you

7
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:10,425
<i>to model for his new line.</i>

8
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:12,208
I teach first grade.

9
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,275
<i>All my life, all I wanted was
to be a doctor.</i>

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,143
I'm still a little concerned
about your finances.

11
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:17,676
<i>I can work it out.</i>

12
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:20,242
<i>The late nights, the mystery men.</i>

13
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:22,009
I resent you interrogating
me like I'm some kind of...

14
00:00:22,134 --> 00:00:23,609
Prostitute?

15
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:25,942
<i> If you think you need to go
out and take what's not yours,</i>

16
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,976
<i>there's obviously something
missing in your life.</i>

17
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:30,029
Oh, my God. Sydney.

18
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:31,976
Did you know her pretty well?
I met her four years ago.

19
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,275
<i>She was the one who convinced
me I could be a real chef.</i>

20
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,143
Do either of you happen
to know where Auggie Kirkpatrick

21
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:37,475
might be?
Why?

22
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,134
Mr. Kirkpatrick's wanted for murder.

23
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:49,143
Wait up.

24
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:51,101
Look who's not so fast after all.

25
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:53,976
Excuse me.

26
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:55,834
Miller wins again.

27
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:58,076
Towards the back.

28
00:00:58,201 --> 00:00:59,709
All right, I'm flipping...
Toward the back.

29
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:01,400
I'm flipping as fast as I can.

30
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:03,776
My God.
Oh, my God.

31
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:04,976
Ladies and gentlemen.

32
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:07,409
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is my fiancÃ©e. Jonah!

33
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,342
That's... She's right here.

34
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:11,275
Hello, embarrassing.

35
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,600
Uh, you might want
to get used to it.

36
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:18,451
My gosh!

37
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:23,308
You just, like, drove by on a bus.

38
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,375
This is officially weird.

39
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,642
This is officially, like,
the greatest thing ever.

40
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:28,809
I'm getting all of these.

41
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:31,709
Jonah, we don't need all of them.
Yes, we do.

42
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:33,709
We do. I'm sending them to
people. Finally, my parents

43
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:35,475
will know that one of us
made it in Hollywood.

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,009
Hey, can I have
a bag for these? All of them.

45
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:38,467
I want all the ones you have.

46
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,442
Anton was right.

47
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:45,143
The schoolteacher's
absolutely gorgeous.

48
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:47,609
All right, look,
whatever issues you have,

49
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:49,509
just leave them at the door tonight.

50
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:51,109
This launch party better go
smoothly.

51
00:01:51,234 --> 00:01:54,642
There is no place
that I would rather be.

52
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:56,575
Except for maybe Fallujah,

53
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,034
getting my fingernails ripped out.

54
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,080
I'm serious.
Being Riley's handler means

55
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,842
she's within ten feet
of you at all times.

56
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:06,242
With Anton in Milan,

57
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:08,753
it's our job to make sure
Riley's story gets out there.

58
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:15,043
Riley is an adult.

59
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,009
Expertly potty-trained.

60
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:18,542
Trust me, all I need to do is go

61
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,067
and drink the free champagne.

62
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:27,534
You're doing this.
Direct orders from New York.

63
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:30,575
You can tell New York

64
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,909
that when we're looking
for their opinion, we'll ask.

65
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:36,101
Why don't you tell
New York yourself?

66
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:43,809
I thought you weren't,

67
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,409
visiting for another two weeks.

68
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:48,134
You know how I love surprises.

69
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,257
This L.A. branch is drowning in red

70
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,009
like a steer in a slaughterhouse.

71
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:59,809
Now, when I hired you to
give this place a makeover,

72
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:01,375
I didn't mean smear it with lipstick

73
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,109
and turn it into a
five-dollar hooker.

74
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:04,976
This office

75
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,734
is pathetic.

76
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:10,242
You hired me to revamp this company

77
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:11,575
from the ground up.

78
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,475
I'm still establishing
new client relationships.

79
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,742
Anton V, for example.

80
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,442
This could be a hugely
successful campaign.

81
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:19,709
Anton V? More like Anton Y.

82
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,942
As in, why are we spending
so many man hours

83
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,575
on a denim line?

84
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,634
And I think we both know
what I mean by man hours.

85
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,076
You could have been a leader,

86
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:33,009
but your focus shifted

87
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:36,034
from your client's assets
to your client's ass.

88
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,801
You're fired.

89
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,709
Get out.

90
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:43,168
Take your bat and balls with you.

91
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,185
Balibal, Dark_Chii, Just-In, Luoleilina,
SirHill et WoLF971 présentent...

92
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,876
It's too early to be awake,

93
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:58,876
let alone engaged
in physical activity.

94
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:01,175
That's the worst part of L.A.

95
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,575
No seasons means

96
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,976
no excuses not to exercise.

97
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:06,175
Leave it to the Cincinnati girl

98
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,709
to complain
about 350 days of sunshine.

99
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,275
Whatever.

100
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,208
You L.A. natives-- you don't
even know what you're missing.

101
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,442
Changing leaves,

102
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,143
hot cocoa at the football games.

103
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:19,208
Skyline Chili... so good.

104
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:23,076
I know exactly
what season it is in L.A.

105
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:25,175
Concert season.

106
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,809
L.A. Phil, Friday night.

107
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,475
Orchestra section.

108
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,009
A little wine,
a little Rachmaninoff.

109
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:33,076
What do you say?

110
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:34,308
Since when have you been interested

111
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:35,509
in classical music?

112
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:36,642
Since Ella told me

113
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,642
you had a thing
for Russian composers.

114
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:41,009
That's very sweet, but, um,

115
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:44,375
kind of sounds like a date, David.

116
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,175
Good. That's how
it's supposed to sound.

117
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,842
Come on, Disney Concert Hall
has insanely comfortable seats.

118
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:51,867
I should know.
I spent hours sleeping in them.

119
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:55,676
I'm sure you have.

120
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:59,268
I just have a lot
going on right now.

121
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:09,542
Oh, my God.

122
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:13,201
I got to get down there.

123
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:32,143
Do you want to tell me why the hell

124
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:33,742
the cops found
your blood on that knife?

125
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,809
David, I didn't kill her.

126
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,109
Look, after you passed
out that night,

127
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:39,676
I showed up at Syd's.

128
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:41,342
She was coked-up, drunk.

129
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,143
I tried to stop her
from doing another line,

130
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:44,776
she came at me with that knife.

131
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:46,208
You know my record.

132
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,809
I look guilty as hell, so...
I lied to the cops.

133
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,776
Ended up here.

134
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:56,934
I never thought
you could have done it.

135
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,143
I woke up
with that knife in my hand.

136
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:06,475
I saw you in that bed.

137
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,876
You were out cold.

138
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,809
There is no way
you got up and killed her.

139
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:12,909
What are you talking about?

140
00:06:13,034 --> 00:06:14,442
Someone framed you.

141
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:15,976
Or at least they tried to.

142
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:18,467
Now, I'm the one going down for it.

143
00:06:23,268 --> 00:06:25,109
My father.

144
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:27,742
Your dad?
If anyone's capable of murder, he is.

145
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:30,143
But that doesn't explain
why he would frame his own kid.

146
00:06:30,268 --> 00:06:32,509
He knew that Syd and I
were sleeping together.

147
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:33,909
He hates me.

148
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:35,609
I'm not letting you
take the fall for this.

149
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:36,909
First,

150
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:39,308
let me take care of your bail,
and then I'm going to go

151
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,409
to his house, and I'm gonna find
whatever piece of evidence

152
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,109
I can to link him to Syd's death.

153
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:45,300
All right?

154
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,000
*

155
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,876
You wanted to see me?

156
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:02,201
Come in.

157
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:05,466
It is an honor to finally meet you.

158
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,942
<i>Your article in Vanity
Fair is pretty much</i>

159
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,709
what inspired me
to become a publicist.

160
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,876
Shockingly, I didn't call you
here for your life story.

161
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:15,575
Although, your absentee father
and pill-popping mother make

162
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,876
for a very juicy tale.

163
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:19,909
How did you know that...?

164
00:07:20,034 --> 00:07:22,201
You'd be surprised what I know.

165
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:25,143
We need to talk about tonight.

166
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,375
You have nothing
to worry about tonight.

167
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,642
I have been running point on
Anton V since the beginning.

168
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:32,208
You mean, you had a chance

169
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,009
to stop a designer from risking
his line on some schoolteacher

170
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:37,342
who's never stepped
in front of the camera before?

171
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:40,076
Actually, I warned Caleb

172
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:42,876
that Anton was making
a mistake with Riley.

173
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:45,175
You must have been
terribly unconvincing.

174
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,976
Take it from a
former advertising exec.

175
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,742
Riley Richmond as the face of his

176
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:52,242
Real People campaign
is about as real

177
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,509
and interesting
as a plastic mannequin.

178
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:57,509
Anton can't sell
a rags-to-riches fairytale

179
00:07:57,634 --> 00:07:59,876
using someone who's had
every opportunity given to her

180
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,500
on a silver platter.

181
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:04,501
Here.

182
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,934
I'm supposed
to get Riley to say this?

183
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:16,375
With all due respect, Ms. Woodward,

184
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,676
none of this is true.

185
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,609
If you have a problem,
there's a long list

186
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:22,101
of eager assistants willing
to take your place.

187
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:26,676
No problem.

188
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:29,234
No problem at all.

189
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:43,709
So after leaving you my fifth
unreturned voicemail,

190
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:45,942
I figured that you must
be buried deep beneath

191
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,309
the great American screenplay.

192
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:50,475
When do I get to read it?
Actually, probably never.

193
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,376
You know how Andrew Misher got
that Senior VP gig at Universal?

194
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,767
In the process,

195
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,535
<i>Living in Reverse got rerouted
to development hell.</i>

196
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,343
What do you think you're doing?

197
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,942
Bringing you your wardrobe.

198
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:05,443
And hi.

199
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,343
I just read the bio you sent me.

200
00:09:07,468 --> 00:09:08,675
Every word is a lie.

201
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,590
What are you talking
about? What's going on?

202
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:15,608
"Raised by a single mother
in a low-income household,

203
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,222
"Riley Richmond fought gang violence

204
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,675
"on the rough streets of Boston's

205
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:19,933
"Roxbury neighborhood.

206
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,934
"Her dreams to teach
brought her to L.A.,

207
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,909
"where Anton V discovered her
on a playground

208
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:25,855
and changed her life forever."

209
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,042
Riley's from Beacon Hill.

210
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,343
Her dad's an attorney

211
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:33,071
who argues in front
of the Supreme Court,

212
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,376
<i>and her mom's an editor
for the Boston Globe.</i>

213
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,942
Exactly.

214
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,109
The masses don't relate

215
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:39,703
to private schools and brownstones.

216
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,675
Ella, none of this is
even close to the truth.

217
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,443
I'm not some WPK stereotype.

218
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:46,542
And I'm not going to the launch

219
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:47,836
if it means lying about who I am.

220
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,176
Okay, look, Riley, it's no secret

221
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:52,076
that we're not
the closest of friends,

222
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:56,242
but the "W" in WPK just took
a battle axe to Caleb,

223
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,142
and...

224
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:01,475
if I let her down tonight, I'm next.

225
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:05,234
Why do you even want to
work for someone like that?

226
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,276
Because work's all I have, Riley.

227
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,343
Okay? I don't come home

228
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,875
to a hug from Jonah
and a voicemail from my parents

229
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:14,028
telling me how proud they are.

230
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,709
My life is my BlackBerry.

231
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:20,809
So you want me to lie

232
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,495
so you can protect your job?

233
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,482
That...

234
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:28,376
and for you.

235
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:30,276
I mean, didn't you read
your contract?

236
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,909
If you don't fulfill all
publicity obligations,

237
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,924
then you don't get your ten grand.

238
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,343
Now... why don't you

239
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,276
try these on

240
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,475
and I will check
back in later? Okay?

241
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,231
I can't believe this is happening.

242
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,508
Screw it.

243
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,376
I say we finally take our parents
up on that early wedding present.

244
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:55,976
And let my mom relish in the fact

245
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:57,242
that I can't live on my own?

246
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:58,742
You know she's been dying to say

247
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,276
"I told you so" since we moved here.

248
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:01,660
I'm not taking her money.

249
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,009
You can't go to this party

250
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:04,875
forced to lie through your teeth.

251
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:06,909
All right, we'll figure
something out.

252
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:09,242
How many drunken wedding guests

253
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,168
have you filmed dancing to "YMCA"?

254
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,608
It's my turn.
I want to do this for us.

255
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:19,343
And if getting paid means
lying about who I am,

256
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:21,709
then... I guess it won't kill me

257
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,639
to stretch the truth this one time.

258
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,701
What are you doing here?

259
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,401
Surprised to see me
when I should be at yoga?

260
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,242
I'm here to talk to my father, so...

261
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:52,502
Really? Because he's at a medical

262
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:53,919
conference in Rome.

263
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,675
You get within 500 feet
of my son again

264
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,176
and I will have you arrested.

265
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,976
After you put Noah in the hospital,

266
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,305
I filed for a restraining order.

267
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:04,675
You're really

268
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,308
pulling all the stops, aren't you?

269
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,343
You know what, take the blinders
off for a second, Vanessa.

270
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:10,742
My father's a killer.

271
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,942
He had every reason

272
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,608
in the world to want Sydney dead.

273
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,776
He was sleeping with her
right up until she died.

274
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,487
She was going to tell you.

275
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:23,176
Michael would never do something
like that to his family.

276
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:24,542
Says who? My dad?

277
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,709
He's an egomaniac.

278
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,288
The second that Syd
threatened to destroy

279
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,789
his career, he killed her.

280
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:33,367
If you want to be a good mother

281
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,542
to Noah, I'd put him in the car

282
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,709
and drive him out of L.A.
as fast as you can.

283
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,575
Get off my property.

284
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,000
My pleasure.

285
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:55,942
My God.

286
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,700
Are you okay?
You stormed out of that office

287
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,875
so fast, you put the whole
bullpen in a tizzy.

288
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,675
I'm not okay.
Amanda Woodward does not

289
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,409
come all the way
across the country just

290
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,642
to slap us on the wrist.

291
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:07,076
Our numbers are fine.
There's no reason

292
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:09,775
for her to be here.
So the woman wants some face time

293
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,176
and a natural tan.
Look, I didn't say anything before,

294
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:14,809
because of my blind loyalty
to Amanda,

295
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:16,809
but she's been asking all kinds
of questions about you:

296
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:20,172
your call logs, your lunches,
your, your client list...

297
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:24,434
What?

298
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,942
She's the president of WPK.

299
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,942
Less than a year ago, I was rolling

300
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,909
phone calls and filling
Yogurtland orders.

301
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,542
There is something going on, Ella.

302
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:33,875
You can't stay there.

303
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,842
Really?
And since when are you

304
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:38,109
out to offer a helping hand?
Don't you get it?

305
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,709
That woman will get inside your head

306
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:41,236
and make you do things
that you never

307
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,446
dreamed that you would do.

308
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:44,376
That woman is the reason

309
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:46,042
why I don't take vacation days.

310
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:49,167
She's the reason why I can
count all my closest friends

311
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,621
on one hand and the reason why I
spend all my money on shoes.

312
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,083
This is where it all pays offb.

313
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:00,168
***

314
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:11,349
You're just in time for Jonah's

315
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:13,309
world famous Miller Mojito.

316
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,020
Perfect, the stronger,
the better, Jonah.

317
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,909
There is no way I am going
to this party sober.

318
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:19,567
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

319
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:24,042
So, how are we coming on that bio?

320
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,242
All up here.

321
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:26,573
Okay, people.

322
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:27,943
Time to wet your whistles

323
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,233
with a Killer Miller Mojito.

324
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,835
You're... free.

325
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:40,642
Sort of.

326
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:43,100
David posted my bail.

327
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,068
What'd I miss around here?

328
00:14:50,634 --> 00:14:52,209
Gosh, nothing.
Just really,

329
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:54,141
typical sunbathing, barbecue...

330
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,400
Police raid.

331
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,980
I heard about that.

332
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,068
You had no idea the police
were looking for you?

333
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,901
Wait a minute, you guys don't
really think I'm guilty?

334
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:15,634
I'm not a murderer.
I didn't kill Sydney.

335
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,968
I'm going to go
get ready for tonight.

336
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:32,742
Actually, can I take
a look at that dress?

337
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:33,975
I don't have anything to wear.

338
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,142
Yeah, sure, no problem. Come with.

339
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,442
We should probably get going, Riley.

340
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,102
Start getting ready,
like, yesterday.

341
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,001
Come on.

342
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:57,509
The cops really
messed this place up?

343
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:59,415
Enter at your own risk.

344
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:00,776
Heard you were back.

345
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,075
I guess it didn't take long

346
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,242
for the Neighborhood Watch to form.

347
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:06,242
They take turns patrolling
the courtyard yet?

348
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:07,809
I know what people are saying,

349
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,275
and it's totally stupid.

350
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,093
You're obviously not a killer.

351
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:14,142
I appreciate you being in my corner,

352
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:16,473
but everyone out there
turned on me in a heartbeat.

353
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,342
If they see you
hanging around with me,

354
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:19,853
you'll be next.

355
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,142
Do you hear what you're saying?

356
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:22,843
If they really think

357
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:24,232
you're capable of killing Sydney,

358
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,193
then the people in that
courtyard aren't our friends.

359
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,642
But if you don't

360
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,781
want me hanging around...
I get it.

361
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:37,742
You were pretty much out of here
the second we slept together.

362
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,831
When the guy runs off to Mexico,

363
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:41,999
it's kind of obvious

364
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,567
he's just not that into you.

365
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,142
I didn't leave because of us.

366
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:51,108
I left because I was
pissed at myself

367
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:53,542
for blowing it with Marcello.

368
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:54,845
Don't take it personally.

369
00:16:55,034 --> 00:16:57,242
It's hard not to.

370
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:00,375
I'm not like the girls in L.A.

371
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,478
I don't just sleep around.

372
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:03,979
I guess I just

373
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,649
expected a phone call or something.

374
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:09,042
You're right.

375
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,300
I messed up. I...

376
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,076
things just got pretty
intense with us pretty fast.

377
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,952
Maybe it's just

378
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:21,081
better that we stick
with a friend vibe for awhile.

379
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,200
That's fine.

380
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:26,734
Totally cool.

381
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:36,776
Oh, my gosh, you thought

382
00:17:36,901 --> 00:17:38,639
that limo was awesome,
check this out.

383
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:43,477
Oh, my God.

384
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:55,108
Hot for teacher!

385
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:57,408
You look fantastic.

386
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:59,509
Come on.
Let's go show off those pearly whites.

387
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:01,912
And remember,
Anton changed your life.

388
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,542
Let's go.

389
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,958
Ladies and gentlemen,

390
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,567
the face of Anton V's
"Real Denim" line,

391
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,175
Who's your boyfriend?

392
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,718
Can I have a picture of

393
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:18,178
just Riley please?

394
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,867
Riley, over here!

395
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,520
They are loving her.

396
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,909
You know it's only a matter of time

397
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:33,361
before you're out
there on the carpet.

398
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:34,903
It just takes some people

399
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,823
longer to recognize talent
when it's sitting there

400
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,701
right in front of their face.

401
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,476
How did gang violence
affect you growing up?

402
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,342
Do you feel like a princess
in a fairy tale?

403
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:46,081
After raising you and your
brother all on her own...

404
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:47,375
Riley, do you see yourself

405
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,044
as a role model for
young women everywhere?

406
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:50,627
Does this seem real to you at all?

407
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,255
Riley, sweetheart,

408
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,142
come here, come here.
I have someone

409
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,309
I want you to meet. Thank you.
Bye. Thanks so much.

410
00:18:58,434 --> 00:19:01,108
Remember, you escaped the
streets to chase a dream.

411
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:03,042
You are a survivor.

412
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:05,834
One wrong sound bite and you can
kiss that ten grand good-bye.

413
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:10,008
I combed through his desk,
his files... nothing.

414
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:12,191
Your dad was having an affair.

415
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,042
If he's hiding something,
it'll be in a place

416
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:15,801
where his own wife won't even touch.

417
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:23,100
Let me call you back.

418
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,243
How long

419
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:39,863
do I need to stay here?
Until the last

420
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:41,142
blinding flashbulb.

421
00:20:41,267 --> 00:20:42,907
You are doing such a good job,
by the way.

422
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,408
I don't feel good about any of this.

423
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,870
What happens if my students find out

424
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,343
that the person who
teaches them to tell

425
00:20:48,468 --> 00:20:49,642
the truth is a total liar?

426
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,842
Riley, relax. Okay?

427
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:53,809
I highly doubt the bouncer will be

428
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:56,211
lifting up the velvet rope
for a first grader.

429
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,475
Why don't you just

430
00:20:58,675 --> 00:20:59,809
go find Jonah and dream about

431
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:01,550
how you're going to spend
your ten grand?

432
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:03,434
Great.

433
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,892
It's quite a party.

434
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:11,508
You somehow convinced every member

435
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,209
of the fashion press
to care about real people.

436
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:17,609
Anton V is an important client.

437
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,375
Trust me, Riley
has been rattling off

438
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,176
that bio so well, it's almost as if

439
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,323
she actually had to struggle
a day in her life.

440
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:27,009
Good work, Ella.

441
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,845
Maybe you're not
as useless as I thought.

442
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:47,575
What does a girl have to do

443
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,934
to get an autograph around here? 

444
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,475
Look at you!
I totally thought you were a model.

445
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,508
That would be you on the life-sized

446
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,009
print ad.
I'm so proud of you.

447
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,508
Trust me, this whole night is just

448
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:00,583
one big, superficial fantasy.

449
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:03,209
David said he was coming.

450
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:04,642
Have you seen him?

451
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:05,907
He just texted.
Something came up.

452
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,742
Which in David speak probably means

453
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,035
he met a girl on Sunset
and had to buy her a drink.

454
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:12,705
Of course.

455
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,958
Wait a second... why are you
asking about David?

456
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,775
There's...

457
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,508
there's no reason.
I'm just

458
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:20,775
wondering.

459
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,976
What?
Oh, my God.

460
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:24,243
You are totally blushing right now.

461
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:25,509
What? It's hot in here!

462
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:28,679
Come on.

463
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,138
Can you name anyone

464
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,508
who's more my polar opposite?

465
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,609
Okay, the five-inch heels,

466
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:34,775
the three-hour hair,

467
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,854
<i>the this.</i>

468
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,142
Okay, all right.

469
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:42,375
Maybe I have

470
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:44,542
a teeny crush on him.
Okay, I knew it!

471
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,343
I've always seen you guys
shoot looks across the pool.

472
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:48,209
<i>Well looking's probably about</i>

473
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:49,575
as far as it's going to go.

474
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:52,375
Plus, with my workload,
it's just impossible.

475
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,176
How do you know unless you try?

476
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,290
The worst thing would
be letting your life

477
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,918
pass you by and having it take
your soul mate with it.

478
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:07,009
Bottle of water for the model

479
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:08,642
and a vodka soda for her keeper.

480
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,675
Right away!
Make that two vodkas.

481
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,942
Got it!

482
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,209
Ooh, the new Judith Leiber...

483
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:15,709
Parting gift from the ex.

484
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,854
She threw it at me
on her way out the door.

485
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,876
Melissa Sax.

486
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,575
Talent agent, I know.

487
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,709
<i>Your photos are all over Variety,</i>

488
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:26,709
along with your reputation.

489
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,209
Let me guess: I'm a shark

490
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:29,907
who wants to eat this town
for breakfast?

491
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,241
Something like that.

492
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,309
I guess we have a lot in common.

493
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,076
Wait a minute... you know me?

494
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:37,309
Of course.

495
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,209
I've been trying to catch
your eye all night.

496
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:43,042
You've got it now.

497
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:46,408
You're a very talented girl.

498
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:49,009
Far too talented to be wasting
your time at any job

499
00:23:49,134 --> 00:23:51,408
with the word "junior" in front of it.
What are you saying?

500
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,876
I should start over
in some agency mail room?

501
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,809
Actually, I think you'd look
pretty hot in a corner office.

502
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,076
I'm not an agent.
Really?

503
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:04,909
You have an eye
for talent, you're driven...

504
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:08,862
and I have a feeling
you're dangerously persuasive.

505
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,609
And from my

506
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:13,367
research, I would say you're

507
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:14,775
quite the people person.

508
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:17,442
Why don't we find somewhere quiet

509
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:19,034
and discuss your career?

510
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:55,343
Our agency's been looking
for someone with your claws.

511
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:58,742
Why are you wasting your time
at some dead-end PR firm?

512
00:24:58,867 --> 00:25:00,709
I'd hardly call it "dead-end."

513
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,842
I mean, WPK is the best firm in LA.

514
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:05,243
maybe so.

515
00:25:05,368 --> 00:25:07,942
But what is Ella Simms doing
mopping up celebrity

516
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:09,309
spilled milk?

517
00:25:09,434 --> 00:25:10,609
You should be somewhere where your

518
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:12,301
talents are respected.

519
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,468
I've got to get back to Riley.

520
00:25:21,468 --> 00:25:22,842
I'm on the clock.

521
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:23,942
So quit.

522
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:25,475
Come with me.

523
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,343
I'll double your client load.

524
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:29,001
That's double your commission.

525
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:32,976
I don't want
to burn any bridges here,

526
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:34,642
and this has

527
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:38,942
definitely been fun, but my heart,

528
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:43,309
as cold as it may be,
belongs to WPK.

529
00:25:43,434 --> 00:25:46,508
That's too bad.

530
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:48,567
Amanda Woodward's lucky to have you.

531
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,533
She is.

532
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:09,234
Hungry?

533
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:17,500
This is autumn.

534
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:22,101
In L.A.

535
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,542
I figure you can't
bring the girl to Cincinnati,

536
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,508
bring Cincinnati to the girl.

537
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:31,209
Where did you get Skyline Chili?

538
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:32,809
Where do you think?

539
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:35,076
You did not seriously have this

540
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:37,176
flown out from my hometown.
I figure if I can

541
00:26:37,301 --> 00:26:38,842
find my way into a heavily
guarded mansion

542
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,234
without breaking a sweat,
I can call for delivery.

543
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:49,368
You and I have vastly different
definitions of "delivery."

544
00:28:35,934 --> 00:28:36,142
I'm sorry.
I can't right now.

545
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:37,468
I'm sorry.
That's okay.

546
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:41,742
I know you jumped through hoops
to make tonight perfect, David.

547
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:43,309
I'm sorry.

548
00:28:43,434 --> 00:28:45,375
There's no rush here, at all.

549
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,176
So why do I feel like this isn't how

550
00:28:48,301 --> 00:28:49,343
your other dates end?

551
00:28:49,468 --> 00:28:54,309
I've never dated anyone like you.

552
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:56,368
I hope you know that.

553
00:29:00,334 --> 00:29:01,508
I'm starving.

554
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:03,700
Can we get to that food
before it gets cold?

555
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:06,633
Yeah, I'd love that.

556
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:15,809
Come here often?

557
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:17,867
How's the belle of the ball?

558
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,642
Better, now.

559
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:25,243
I'm officially
schmoozed out, though.

560
00:29:25,368 --> 00:29:27,139
I have schmooze
coming out of my ears.

561
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,976
<i>Hi. I'm writing a column for Vogue</i>

562
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:32,520
about Anton's "Real People."

563
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:36,842
What's it like going
from hand-me-down jeans

564
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:39,442
to becoming the face
of Anton's denim line?

565
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:42,267
You know...

566
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:44,642
When you want something bad enough,

567
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,609
you can't let a little
adversity get in your way.

568
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:49,475
A little?
You're an amazing

569
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,109
story of survival.

570
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:53,475
I read that you and your mom
used to sleep in your car?

571
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,967
Your students must
really look up to you.

572
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,334
My students, right.

573
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,109
You know what, I hope
my students can look up to me,

574
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,142
because...

575
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:06,401
I teach them to be truthful.

576
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,042
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

577
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:13,142
I'm not the role model
that you think I am.

578
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:14,276
Let's get out of here.

579
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:16,176
Wait, what do you mean you're not

580
00:30:16,301 --> 00:30:18,134
a role model?
Look how far you've come.

581
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:25,656
Just do what you've got to do.

582
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:31,800
Anton gave me a fake biography,
and I went along with it.

583
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,009
I'm not from the streets.

584
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:36,142
I've never heard a gunshot

585
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,375
in my life.
I've never even had

586
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,575
my car broken into.

587
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,508
And my parents are still
very much in my life.

588
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,375
In fact, my dad offered
to pay for Harvard Law School,

589
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,142
just so I would
follow in his footsteps.

590
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:47,876
<i>The only real thing here</i>

591
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,934
is that I'm a teacher
who loves her job.

592
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:53,141
Great.

593
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:55,767
Come on.

594
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,001
Excuse me.

595
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,309
Oh, great.

596
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:14,243
Amanda's going to skin me alive.

597
00:31:14,368 --> 00:31:16,667
Not satisfying enough.

598
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,042
<i>The reporter from Vogue just said</i>

599
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:21,076
she's running a story
called "Anton V:

600
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:23,575
Real Jeans for Fake People."

601
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,675
Well, done, Ella.

602
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,642
Riley promised me

603
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:28,076
that she wasn't going
to say anything.

604
00:31:28,201 --> 00:31:29,575
And you trusted her.

605
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,775
I guess your friend's

606
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,609
not such a great friend, after all.

607
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:34,542
See me tomorrow at 1:00.

608
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,533
I'll be at East.

609
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:41,401
Excuse me. They said
they'd keep this up front.

610
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:49,475
How are you, darling?

611
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,842
Oh! I'm great. Well?

612
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:53,276
Thank you so much
for the lovely evening.

613
00:31:53,401 --> 00:31:55,309
And thank you for being
so irresistible.

614
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:57,976
Almost irresistible.

615
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,442
I gave her the apple,

616
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,109
but she didn't bite.

617
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:03,408
She might be young
and idealistic, but she's loyal,

618
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:04,775
Amanda.

619
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,575
She's cute, too.

620
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,775
So are puppies.

621
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,343
She passed your little
test with flying colors.

622
00:32:10,468 --> 00:32:12,243
So I guess now

623
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:13,800
we're even.

624
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:20,408
The next time I decide

625
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:23,076
to get all "in the
moment," please stop me.

626
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:25,742
My big mouth just cost us $10,000.

627
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:28,276
A zillion
magazine ads couldn't make me

628
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:30,375
prouder than I am right now.

629
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,368
Can I talk to you for a sec?

630
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:36,642
Alone.

631
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:38,209
Preferably.

632
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:42,201
I don't think so.

633
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:46,267
Whatever you have to say
you can say in front of Jonah.

634
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,809
The police said they got
an anonymous tip

635
00:32:52,934 --> 00:32:55,575
that I was in Mexico, but you were

636
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,567
the only one who knew
where I was staying.

637
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,842
You mean where you were hiding?

638
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:01,900
It's okay.

639
00:33:03,468 --> 00:33:04,942
The police were looking for you.

640
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,375
They had that knife.

641
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,475
What did you want me to do, lie?

642
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,475
I wanted you to trust me.

643
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,809
Not have the Federales

644
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:14,109
drag me out of my room and throw
me into a six-foot cell.

645
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:17,276
Riley's not the one
with a criminal history here.

646
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:18,775
You know what,
no one's talking to you. Okay.

647
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,009
This is pointless.
Look me

648
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:25,201
in the eye and tell me you
actually think I did this.

649
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:29,942
- You of all people...?
- Dude!

650
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:31,909
- Back off!
- Come on.

651
00:33:32,034 --> 00:33:33,334
Let's just go home.

652
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:03,542
Everything's cool.

653
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:04,709
Oh, my God.

654
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,543
It's fine, just...

655
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,642
Just get out of here.

656
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:09,842
You don't need that.

657
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,208
You don't know what I need.

658
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,924
Seriously,

659
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:15,575
it's best if you just... leave.

660
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,942
You want to throw away

661
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,542
all your progress for a stupid drink?
What progress?

662
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:22,076
In a few weeks,
I'm going to be in jail,

663
00:34:22,201 --> 00:34:23,575
so none of this even matters.

664
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,542
Don't talk like that.
Why not?

665
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,676
I'm a drunk with a record
who can't even convince

666
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:30,842
his own friends he's innocent.
Who cares what they think?

667
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:33,696
I do! I care!

668
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:38,509
You don't need that.

669
00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:41,286
You need someone
who believes in you.

670
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:25,164
Have a seat.

671
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:27,624
Thank you.

672
00:35:28,901 --> 00:35:30,375
I've never been here before.

673
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,809
The food looks amazing.

674
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,214
Don't get comfortable.
I'm meeting

675
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:35,423
someone in ten minutes.

676
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:39,636
What's your end game?

677
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,442
Honestly...

678
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:44,909
I want to be you.

679
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,709
That's a pretty lofty
goal for someone

680
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:48,776
who can't even perform
a simple babysitting task.

681
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:52,109
Okay, I'll admit, last night
wasn't my finest hour,

682
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:53,842
but I am a great publicist.

683
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,009
You're a decent publicist

684
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,275
who hasn't learned
to disengage her emotions.

685
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,442
And prove to me you want this.

686
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,203
I guarantee you,
this job is my life.

687
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:09,742
You know, I can't help
but wonder what sort of trouble

688
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,417
your model friend would
find herself in

689
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:12,942
should, I don't know...

690
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:15,942
her school find out that
she used sick days

691
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:17,257
to work the photo shoot.

692
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,542
They'd probably fire her.

693
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:23,009
Did she know

694
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,776
that your job was
on the line last night?

695
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:26,043
That's not the point.

696
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,676
Riley's punishment was
not getting her ten grand.

697
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:31,475
Why torture her?
What does she matter to WPK?

698
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,575
She doesn't matter to WPK, at all.

699
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,001
But she matters to you.

700
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,976
So if you plan on staying
around for more than a week,

701
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,642
you need to show me
that you are capable

702
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:41,475
of putting your work
above everything else,

703
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,500
including your friendships.

704
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:46,609
Call the school.

705
00:36:46,734 --> 00:36:48,288
Tell them what she did.

706
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:02,143
If that's what it takes
to be you, then...

707
00:37:02,268 --> 00:37:04,609
I'm sorry.

708
00:37:04,734 --> 00:37:06,681
I guess I'm not interested.

709
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,043
Enough.

710
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:20,942
I am burning all of these.

711
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:22,976
Recycle, it's better
for the environment.

712
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:26,375
You know what?
I say good riddance.

713
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,709
Your heart belongs in the classroom,

714
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:30,467
not on the runway.

715
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,834
That's probably Ella,
calling to ream me out.

716
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,009
Principal Fleming, hi.

717
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:48,043
I know, you're right.

718
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:49,683
I completely messed up.

719
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:52,351
Look, I'm sorry.
Couldn't I...?

720
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:55,606
I know, you're right. I...

721
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:05,532
what happened?

722
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:10,709
I just got fired.

723
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:12,342
What?

724
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,475
Why, because of the pictures?

725
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:18,076
Principal Fleming somehow found out

726
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:20,143
I used sick days to be
at the photo shoot.

727
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,308
Give me a break.
I mean, everybody fakes

728
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,442
a cough into the phone
every once in awhile.

729
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:26,909
You should fight this.
She's right.

730
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:28,471
I used a week of sick days

731
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:30,014
to work a higher- paying job.

732
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:31,375
This is grounds for being fired.

733
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,001
What was I thinking?
Come on.

734
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,542
Riles, it's okay.

735
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:41,734
It's not.
We have no source of income.

736
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:45,842
Genius idea. You ready?

737
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:48,809
I'll finally take my Uncle
Louis up on that gig at his

738
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,327
office supply store.
Bookkeeping job?

739
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:52,676
It's a paycheck.

740
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:55,039
It's 12-hour days,
including weekends.

741
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,776
You'll have no time to write.

742
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,842
You can't take meetings.
You said it yourself,

743
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:00,375
years will go by, and you'll still

744
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,880
be on page ten of your screenplay.

745
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:04,043
It was really easy for me

746
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:06,175
to give highfalutin' speeches
when I had the choice.

747
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:09,742
If anything, I should be
looking for the new job.

748
00:39:09,867 --> 00:39:11,242
I am the one who got fired.

749
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:13,742
Look at everything you did

750
00:39:13,867 --> 00:39:15,475
so we could pay off our bills.

751
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,109
That wasn't easy.

752
00:39:17,234 --> 00:39:19,333
Now, it's my turn, okay?

753
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,742
We'll be fine.

754
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:24,001
I promise.

755
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:27,168
You didn't.

756
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:34,453
Is everything okay?

757
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:36,123
Fine.

758
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,809
Just suffering
from a little lunch coma.

759
00:39:38,934 --> 00:39:40,442
But you,

760
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:43,709
my friend, you have
some explaining to do.

761
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:46,208
What's up with the harvest
fest in my living room?

762
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,134
Did Lauren say anything?

763
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:50,636
Just how super sweet

764
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,043
and romantic you were.

765
00:39:52,168 --> 00:39:53,809
And some other stuff
that I couldn't hear

766
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,725
over the sound of my own gagging.

767
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:58,442
When did you get cute?

768
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:01,339
Just a little dinner.
It's not a big deal.

769
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,043
Play it cool, but I know

770
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:05,809
that you're a cheese ball at heart.

771
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:07,375
At least there's some

772
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:10,809
good news coming out
of this courtyard.

773
00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:12,609
Actually...

774
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:15,275
you might want to prepare
yourself for a little pro bono

775
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,580
spin work on Auggie's reputation.

776
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:18,809
Auggie has you wrapped

777
00:40:18,934 --> 00:40:20,042
around his murderous little finger.

778
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:21,642
He didn't do it.

779
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:22,753
My dad killed Sydney.

780
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,422
What?

781
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:27,109
I found a necklace in his car...

782
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:28,275
Sydney's necklace.

783
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,208
I know 'cause I gave it to her.

784
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:32,575
She was wearing it
the night she died.

785
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:36,043
Your dad's a genius heart surgeon.

786
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:38,309
Why would he hold on
to hard-core evidence?

787
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:39,642
I don't know.

788
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:41,188
But he's got a plan for everything.

789
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:42,308
You know, he did everything

790
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:44,143
in his power
to make my life a living hell.

791
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,475
And if I play this
right, I can return

792
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:48,736
the favor and put that bastard
away for good.
