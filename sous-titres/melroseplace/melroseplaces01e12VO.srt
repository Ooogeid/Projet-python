00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:01,917
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,587
I'm Ella.
Junior publicist.

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:07,173
{\pos(192,220)}You are a hugely talented filmmaker.

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,966
{\pos(192,220)}We'll get married, guys.

5
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,553
{\pos(192,220)}All my life, all I want to be
is a doctor.

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,758
{\pos(192,220)}I'm still a little concerned
about your finances.

7
00:00:14,883 --> 00:00:17,925
- I can work it out.
- The late nights, the mysterious men...

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,617
I resend you to interrogate me

9
00:00:19,742 --> 00:00:21,521
- like I'm a kind of...
- Prostitute?

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,230
My dad killed Sydney.

11
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,317
I found Sydney's necklace in his car.
She was wearing it the night she died.

12
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:29,459
- Detective.
- You're under arrest.

13
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:32,657
Amanda Woodward does not come
all the way across the country

14
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:34,377
just to slap us on the wrist.

15
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,745
My friend Jane
said I can stay in the penthouse,

16
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:41,775
and I can't wait to become a part
of each and every one of your lives.

17
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:00,189
Wait.

18
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:02,683
See you tonight.

19
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,824
Where did my mom get it in her head

20
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:23,093
that a nice simple
ceremony means a reception

21
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:26,229
at copley Plaza in front of
400 of our closest friends?

22
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,433
It's a sample invitation, all right?
Operative word being "sample."

23
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,635
It's not set in Stone.

24
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:33,604
According to my mom, it is.

25
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:35,973
Because she ended up divorced,
when it comes to my wedding,

26
00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:37,680
she wants to do
everything the opposite.

27
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,223
That way, she can make sure I have

28
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,911
the perfect marriage she never had.

29
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:42,893
As if there is such a thing.

30
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:47,273
You're a big girl.
You can do whatever you want.

31
00:01:47,997 --> 00:01:49,886
And have her accuse me
of shattering her dream?

32
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:52,410
It'll be three
weeks of negotiations, and

33
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:54,822
by the time we have everything settled,
she'll get her way.

34
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,960
That's always the way it works out.

35
00:01:57,815 --> 00:01:58,860
Not this time.

36
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:01,312
All right, let's face it,

37
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:04,467
we don't do this whole
engagement thing very well.

38
00:02:05,244 --> 00:02:07,103
I say we put an end to it tonight.

39
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:08,753
What do you mean?

40
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,922
I mean, we drive to Vegas
and get ourselves hitched.

41
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:13,726
Tonight.

42
00:02:14,457 --> 00:02:15,301
Elope?

43
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,713
- My mom will seriously kill me.
- Just think about it, okay?

44
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:24,435
We load up that rocket sled,
we hit the road by 6:00,

45
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,854
and I am kissing
my bride by midnight.

46
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,278
Let's go get married.

47
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,475
Talk to me, Ella.

48
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:48,709
Yawning, the pacing around the apartment
in the middle of the night.

49
00:02:49,123 --> 00:02:50,151
Let me guess.

50
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,243
Still nothing but
radio static from Jonah?

51
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:55,957
Deafening radio static.

52
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,346
I did sell him down the River
on that director credit, but...

53
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,630
How am I supposed to apologize to him
when he won't answer my phone calls?

54
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:08,896
He's not even reading my bbms.

55
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,689
What's going on with you, el?

56
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,609
The amount of people
you've had mad at you,

57
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,195
I have yet to see you get
this bent out of shape over it.

58
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:19,109
I don't know.

59
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,100
I mean, maybe it's because
Jonah is one of the only guys

60
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:24,438
I've ever known who I
can truly be myself with.

61
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:28,009
He gets me.

62
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,752
And he's engaged, Ella.

63
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:37,455
Me... and Jonah an item?

64
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,427
Lor.

65
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,600
You and your scandalous imagination
are spiraling out of control.

66
00:03:44,577 --> 00:03:45,875
It's kind of cute though.

67
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,048
Hey, it's Rick.
We went out a while ago.

68
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:57,736
Oh, right. Hey, Rick.

69
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,951
I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

70
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:03,903
I thought I made it pretty clear I'm not
looking to date anyone right now.

71
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:05,221
<i>No, not a date.</i>

72
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:08,058
I was looking for, you know,
company.

73
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,040
A little daytime fun.

74
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,364
- Today?
- Yeah, if you can.

75
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:16,481
Same financial
arrangement as before?

76
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:23,054
Then why don't you meet me
at the Doheny Hhotel, 3:00.

77
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,555
All right.

78
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,771
If I miss my flight back to LA,
you are gonna be driving me yourself.

79
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,939
Yes, miss.

80
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:58,197
Atoning for
your laundry list of sins?

81
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,276
You're gonna be here a long time.

82
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,069
Look what the Santa Anas blew in.

83
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,039
Did you follow me here?

84
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:10,086
You're a thief, Sydney.
I want it back.

85
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:11,143
Now.

86
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,323
Why would I ever steal

87
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:15,191
from the big bad Amanda Woodward?

88
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:16,659
Where is it?

89
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:18,193
I told you.

90
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,864
I never received the painting.

91
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,900
I didn't have it stolen
from an Upper East Side co-op

92
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:26,031
so it could be sent
third class mail.

93
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:29,787
That painting was worth $19 million.

94
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:33,009
Which my client in Hong Kong would
gladly pay if I actually had it.

95
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,729
You betrayed me.

96
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:37,113
Who betrayed whom?

97
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:39,171
Aren't you the one who
slept with my boyfriend?

98
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,297
Boyfriend?

99
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,384
Michael is happily married, Sydney.

100
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,220
You and I were just
strolls down memory lane for him.

101
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,725
Don't use him
as an excuse to steal from me.

102
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,161
I thought we were friends, Amanda.

103
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:53,820
Friends. We were business partners.

104
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:56,814
I found the paintings,
you turned them into cash.

105
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:58,816
It was all working so
well until you got greedy,

106
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:00,236
stabbed me in the back.

107
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:03,239
Don't you ever get tired
of falsely accusing people?

108
00:06:04,253 --> 00:06:06,476
Even the lord
rested on the seventh day.

109
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,578
You'll never get away with this.

110
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:10,346
I want that painting.

111
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:12,773
And I'll do whatever
it takes to get it back.

112
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,424
CREDITS

113
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,442
{\PUB}{\pos(192,240)}Ungaro is the closest thing
I have to a white flag.

114
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:47,163
{\pos(192,240)}So how long do you
plan on hating me?

115
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,817
{\pos(192,240)}Because these heels make
walking on eggshells very tough.

116
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,287
Oh, I'm sorry.

117
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:55,865
Did, um, selling me
out inconvenience you?

118
00:06:57,781 --> 00:06:59,819
{\pos(192,220)}Okay, look, Jonah,
I get it, all right?

119
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:03,701
{\pos(192,220)}I mean, you have a million reasons
why you should hate my guts, but...

120
00:07:05,323 --> 00:07:07,716
Not having you in my life,
it really sucks, Jonah.

121
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:10,637
I'm so sorry.

122
00:07:10,845 --> 00:07:12,956
{\pos(192,220)}I walk around all day acting like

123
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:15,641
some unflappable tough-as-nails
bitch who doest give a damn

124
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:17,143
what anybody thinks about me,

125
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:18,796
but when I'm with you, I just...

126
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,312
I don't know.

127
00:07:21,422 --> 00:07:23,274
{\pos(192,220)}You make me feel like
I'm better than that.

128
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:25,869
{\pos(192,220)}I'm so happy I could
help boost your self-esteem.

129
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:30,473
{\pos(192,220)}I may be persona non grata
in Jonah Miller universe,

130
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:33,143
{\pos(192,220)}but that doesn't mean I'm
gonna stop working your movie.

131
00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:34,811
No, well, stop, really.

132
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:37,039
{\pos(192,220)}Living in reverse will
survive without you.

133
00:07:37,972 --> 00:07:38,998
Of course it will.

134
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:42,161
{\pos(192,220)}But today I happen to
be working the press tour

135
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:43,653
for Curtis Heller's new movie,

136
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:46,047
{\pos(192,220)}and I think I could
get you a quick pitch.

137
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:47,840
With Curtis Heller?

138
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:53,129
There's no way Curtis Heller
would accept a pitch from me.

139
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:55,056
He has five best
picture nominations.

140
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:56,809
Please.

141
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:59,524
I am in the business
of making things happen.

142
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:02,343
{\pos(192,220)}Least I can do is spread
some of that onto you.

143
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,775
{\pos(192,220)}What are you doing with my phone?

144
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,944
You are accepting my
invitation on loopt.

145
00:08:08,537 --> 00:08:10,321
You are okay with that, right?

146
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,699
We're gonna be running around all day
and night, so this way we will both

147
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:15,751
{\pos(192,220)}know where the other
one is at all times.

148
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:18,163
{\pos(192,220)}And when I have
my moment with Heller...

149
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:23,751
You'll know exactly
where to find us.

150
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:28,652
Okay, as far as peace offerings go,

151
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,675
a Curtis Heller pitch is,

152
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:32,669
that's up there with
the best of them.

153
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:34,303
But listen to me.

154
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:37,473
If I do this, it has to
happen before 4:00, okay?

155
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:40,610
What exactly could
be more important than

156
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:43,855
pitching to the most important
producer of the decade?

157
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,402
Well, Riley and I are
taking a road trip.

158
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:52,446
To Vegas.
We're getting married.

159
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,202
Oh, my God.

160
00:08:58,253 --> 00:09:00,204
Oh, that's perfect.

161
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,623
It's perfect, right?

162
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,833
Yeah, you're just
getting it like that, huh?

163
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,712
Just like ripping off a band-aid.

164
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:09,755
I was joking.

165
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:11,507
I'm kidding. That's...

166
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,156
Wow, that's great, Jonah.

167
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,387
Congratulations.

168
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:18,306
Thank you.

169
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,984
Really happy for you.

170
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:22,252
Thank you, Ella.

171
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:24,711
Just, um,
promise me one thing though.

172
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:25,561
What?

173
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:30,656
You have to get married by Elvis.

174
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:45,092
<i>Shut down Gate 3.</i>

175
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:52,030
My God, Michael.

176
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:54,250
What has happened to you?

177
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,785
It's all a misunderstanding.

178
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,084
You should know
that better than anyone.

179
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:00,535
You were having an affair
with Sydney Andrews?

180
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:03,560
Was it easier for you to kill
the poor woman than to tell your wife?

181
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,261
Bravo, Vanessa.

182
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,163
I never knew you were
such a fine actress.

183
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,900
I came here to tell
you I want a divorce.

184
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,109
I know you killed syd.

185
00:10:14,228 --> 00:10:15,051
My God.

186
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,340
Are you that pathetic?

187
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:19,304
You're trying to
point fingers at me?

188
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:20,777
I came to see you that night.

189
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:23,131
Found her floating in the
pool and you running away.

190
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:23,947
Me?

191
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,582
There was a necklace on the ground.

192
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,951
- I took it.
- To cover up your crime.

193
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,352
No, to protect my family.

194
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:32,222
If they were to lock you up,
Noah would be traumatized.

195
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:34,173
And I could not let that happen.

196
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,528
You're willing to say anything
to save yourself, aren't you?

197
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,830
I don't have to say anything.

198
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,304
When your prints turn up,

199
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,471
everybody's gonna know the truth.

200
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:51,933
You don't just need a lawyer,
you need a psychiatrist.

201
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:55,734
Good-bye, Michael.

202
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:06,080
Come in.

203
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:12,731
Thought this apartment
was a Riley-free zone.

204
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,797
It smelled so good
outside, I had to check it out.

205
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:17,736
Penne arrabbiata.

206
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:21,137
Used to make it for my brothers and sisters
when my mom was working the night shift.

207
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:24,340
You hungry?

208
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,675
No, I'm good.

209
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:30,293
I actually came by to apologize.

210
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:33,583
I should have never
called the police, Auggie.

211
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,068
I should have followed
my gut and trusted you.

212
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:40,683
I let you down, and I'm sorry.

213
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:44,660
Apology accepted.

214
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,246
What do you say we catch up tonight?

215
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,065
A run? Beachwood?

216
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,375
I promise I won't make
you run up the Hill.

217
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,128
Why, are you afraid
I'll beat you to the top?

218
00:11:58,032 --> 00:11:59,676
Actually, I can't today.

219
00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:02,219
Thanks, anyway.

220
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:05,181
Come on.
You'll be gone an hour, tops.

221
00:12:07,088 --> 00:12:08,643
Jonah and I are eloping.

222
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:12,722
What happened? I thought you
were having second thoughts.

223
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:14,441
Not anymore.

224
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,110
Riley, you always told me to be
honest with you no matter what,

225
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,154
- right?
- Of course.

226
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,490
Look, we both know you're
not the same person you were

227
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,167
when you got engaged to Jonah.

228
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,069
How can you commit for the rest

229
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,663
of your life when you don't even
know what kind of life you want?

230
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:36,616
What I want is to be with Jonah,
so if you can't be happy for me,

231
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:38,340
then that's pretty
much your problem.

232
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,544
I'm just being honest with you.

233
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:51,102
<i>David, it's me.</i>

234
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,104
I need your help.

235
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:55,691
- What you need is a good lawyer.
- I didn't kill Sydney.

236
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,236
The night syd died, she threatened to call
Vanessa and tell her about our affair.

237
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,938
- Spare me the bogus alibis.
<i>- I went over there to talk</i>

238
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:04,807
syd out of it, but I was too late.
Syd had already called,

239
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:06,661
and Vanessa got there first.

240
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:09,735
- Why would I ever believe you?
- <i>I don't expect you to.</i>

241
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:13,015
But for the sake of your little brother,
you need to help me.

242
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,884
What does Noah have to do with this?

243
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:17,286
I'm worried
Vanessa's gonna disappear with him,

244
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:19,622
take him out of the
country and never come back.

245
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,458
<i>The police won't arrest her
until the forensics come back</i>

246
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,843
on syd's necklace.

247
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:27,864
So, please, Davey, go
get Noah from school

248
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:30,516
and keep him safe.

249
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:42,446
{\PUB}Look at you.

250
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,290
A-list hotel,

251
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:45,592
smoking-hot dress.

252
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:48,952
Stepped it up since our last date.
I like it.

253
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,999
Geez, you've really gone pro.

254
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:56,503
Professional is always
best for the job, right?

255
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,588
Yeah, well,
how about a little treat?

256
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,094
What's that?

257
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:07,723
It's called nexus.

258
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,517
I got this from a DJ buddy of mine.

259
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:14,311
This stuff makes sex, like, amazing.

260
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:17,223
Here, try it.

261
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:20,326
No, um, I actually
don't do the whole drug thing.

262
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:23,754
I get an upset stomach
from, like, aspirin.

263
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,898
You're adorable.

264
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,206
You should be careful with that.
You never know how you're gonna react.

265
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:34,008
I thought you were gonna leave
your md hat back at the hospital.

266
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:37,918
You're right.

267
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:40,156
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:46,846
Will you at least have a glass
of the good stuff with me?

269
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:47,928
Sure.

270
00:14:49,737 --> 00:14:51,456
But then we should probably...

271
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:54,321
get down to business.

272
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:04,192
Bow tie... check.
Wedding vows... check.

273
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:07,777
I even brought my lucky Penny in case
we decide to hit the Blackjack table.

274
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:09,825
You're usually still
stuffing t-shirts

275
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,821
 into your bag
as we're walking out the door.

276
00:15:11,946 --> 00:15:14,768
This isn't just
a road trip; we are eloping.

277
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:16,456
Beside, I cannot forget one thing.

278
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,041
I need to be ready here

279
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,723
'cause Ella's gonna text
me soon letting me know

280
00:15:20,848 --> 00:15:22,796
that all systems are
go for this pitch.

281
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,422
Oh, my God, I'm pitching,
I'm eloping,

282
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,174
I'm trying on new cologne.

283
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,052
I just have a feeling I'm
gonna seriously beef this.

284
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,580
Not possible.

285
00:15:30,705 --> 00:15:32,865
You are, like,
the world's greatest storyteller.

286
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,543
You have nothing to worry about.

287
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,774
No open suitcase, no

288
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,741
clothes scattered all
over the living room.

289
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:46,179
I kinda thought you'd be
further ahead than me right now.

290
00:15:46,741 --> 00:15:48,280
Oh, I'm just about to start.

291
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,849
Is your slow-pack
mode any indication

292
00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:56,422
that you're waffling here?

293
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:58,039
I'm not waffling.

294
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,541
Okay. Look, I know how hard this is

295
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,670
to do to your mom and your dad.

296
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,965
I mean, they want to see
you walk down the aisle.

297
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,550
My parents do, too. What do you say

298
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,404
we call 'em and see if they
want to meet us in sin city?

299
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:13,306
My mom would never let me
get off the phone until I swear

300
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,682
on my grandmother's grave
that I'm not eloping.

301
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:19,558
We're getting married tonight,
Jonah.

302
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,238
I'm packing right now.

303
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,420
Oh, this is it.

304
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,282
They're on San Vicente.

305
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:34,594
The London Hotel.

306
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:38,121
Uh, all right, I need my jacket.

307
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:41,082
Briefcase, keys. Where are my keys?

308
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,581
Keys are in your hand.

309
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:44,210
I love you.

310
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,170
I love you.

311
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,513
Good luck!

312
00:16:47,187 --> 00:16:48,187
Thank you.

313
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,280
Okay, that was
the best interview yet.

314
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:06,659
The stuff about malaria?
Priceless.

315
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:08,328
If only it were true, right?

316
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:11,363
So, how many more of these
things do I have to do?

317
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,566
Oh, you're almost done.

318
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:15,959
You have satellite tour in 30,
so you have a little bit of a break.

319
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:17,869
I'm gonna need a
scotch and soda, please.

320
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,204
Oh, absolutely.

321
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,914
And I have a little
live entertainment

322
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,976
to go along with that,
no extra charge.

323
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:24,946
Excuse me?

324
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:26,729
There is this
amazing writer-director

325
00:17:26,854 --> 00:17:28,463
going out with a pitch tomorrow,

326
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,015
and I thought maybe that you
would want to have a shot at it

327
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,053
- before the rest of the town does.
- Just have his agent call Craig.

328
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,623
We can do that.
I just thought, you know,

329
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:38,473
since Scott rudin was
meeting with him tomorrow,

330
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,354
and then he was meeting
with Harvey Weinstein...

331
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:41,694
Wait, wait, wait.

332
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:43,981
Since when is rudin taking
pitch meetings from nobodies?

333
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,564
People are chomping
at the bit on this one.

334
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:48,483
Look, it'll take you
ten minutes, tops.

335
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:51,927
All right, where is this kid?

336
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:53,539
Fantastic.

337
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:57,821
Jonah Miller... aka
the new Spike Jonze...

338
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,690
I would like you to
meet Curtis Heller.

339
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,849
This better be good.

340
00:18:02,974 --> 00:18:05,084
Oh, it is good, Curtis.
It is genius.

341
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,449
Jonah is genius.

342
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:10,414
Well, no pressure there.

343
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:12,625
No pressure at all.

344
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,006
Okay, make this quick

345
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,423
you got ten minutes
before you get the hook.

346
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:20,839
Toasty out here, huh?

347
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:26,039
"Opening shot on a stark
highway drenched in sun.

348
00:18:27,195 --> 00:18:30,162
Through the ripples of heat,
we see the hint of movement

349
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:32,757
on the horizon. Cut."

350
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:36,740
What are you doing?

351
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,700
Just tell him the story
the way you told it to me.

352
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,044
Sometime this decade?

353
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,378
Jacob Kane is 25
and he's lost everything.

354
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,234
He drives his beat-up old jeep
up to this intersection

355
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,884
and he can either go
right or he can go left.

356
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:58,271
And at this moment he realizes,

357
00:18:58,396 --> 00:18:59,372
"wait a second.

358
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:01,507
What if I do neither?

359
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:05,185
What if I throw this thing
into reverse right now and I go back

360
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,312
and undo all the blunders and

361
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,565
missteps and mistakes that
led me right to this moment?"

362
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,484
Imagine those possibilities.

363
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,173
It's good, right?

364
00:19:20,753 --> 00:19:23,072
I didn't think it could get
any better than last time,

365
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:25,163
but you definitely proved me wrong.

366
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:31,586
Is it... is it really hot in here?

367
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:34,047
Hadn't noticed. Been kinda busy.

368
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,883
I need to splash my
face with some water.

369
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:39,336
Whoo! You okay?

370
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:44,474
My head...

371
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,832
'Cause I am feeling great.

372
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:11,801
{\PUB}Someone have a little
too much to drink?

373
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:16,797
You slipped me something,
didn't you?

374
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:20,942
Okay, I... I tossed a
pill in your champagne.

375
00:20:22,112 --> 00:20:23,005
Oh, God...

376
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,389
It wasn't a lot. I took double that,

377
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,558
and I'm fine. I think
you just drank too much.

378
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,605
I told you, Rick, I don't do drugs.

379
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,649
I know, I just thought
that once you tried it
you'd be into it.

380
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:40,322
Should I call a doctor?

381
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,871
You should go.

382
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,327
I want to make
sure that you're okay.

383
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:49,202
You should go.

384
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:04,761
Can we go swimming in the pool?

385
00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:07,430
Not right now, bud.
Come on. We don't have time.

386
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:09,265
But when we get to San Diego,

387
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,568
you can do all the
swimming you want, okay?

388
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:13,203
Hey, do you like outer space?

389
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:17,040
All right, check out this cool game.

390
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:18,608
Here, switch me.

391
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:20,777
I'm gonna go pack.

392
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:22,576
Come on.

393
00:21:42,423 --> 00:21:43,778
Lauren, it's David.

394
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,587
I can't make dinner tonight.
I gotta head out of town.

395
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:51,906
- David, help me!
- Lauren, what's wrong?

396
00:21:55,474 --> 00:21:57,272
Lauren, tell me where you are.

397
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:00,443
Doheny Hotel.

398
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:05,198
452.

399
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,610
Okay. Lauren?

400
00:22:11,986 --> 00:22:13,696
He was just sleeping
with his eyes open.

401
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:15,098
Like a lizard.

402
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:16,541
Give me these. I know.

403
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,168
I was about to check his
pulse and then I saw him blink.

404
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:22,138
I was seriously
thinking of throwing,
like, one of those
little pretzels at him.

405
00:22:22,263 --> 00:22:24,407
Just hit him and see if he was still alive, even.

406
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:26,532
Right at his forehead. Just...

407
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,678
You know what, though? It's his loss

408
00:22:28,803 --> 00:22:31,948
because you were amazing.
You were brilliant once again.

409
00:22:32,073 --> 00:22:33,601
Thank you. I'm
glad I could entertain

410
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,228
- at least one person.
- Hey, it's okay.

411
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,454
I'm fine with being an
underemployed videographer

412
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:40,399
for the rest of my life.

413
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:41,824
You know what we need?

414
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:44,861
Kill Bill 1 and 2
at the New Beverly.

415
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:48,097
I'm smelling popcorn, red vines,

416
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:49,658
and lots and lots of uma.

417
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:52,536
That sounds perfect.

418
00:22:53,312 --> 00:22:54,121
But, uh...

419
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,081
Remember? I have to go get married.

420
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,774
Ah, that's right.

421
00:22:57,899 --> 00:22:59,959
Hey, Jonah. Do yourself a favor.

422
00:23:00,084 --> 00:23:02,969
Make sure she gets to see
fireworks on her wedding night.

423
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:21,164
Hey, Violet. I need
you to look after Noah.

424
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:22,482
Are you cool with that?

425
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,834
You're the only one that's here.

426
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:25,951
Sure.

427
00:23:26,076 --> 00:23:27,529
- Thank you.
- Of course.

428
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:28,531
What's going on?

429
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,257
Um, something happened to Lauren.

430
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:31,950
Hopefully, I'll be back
soon, okay? 

431
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,243
I know you.

432
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:37,581
I'm not sure you do.

433
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,376
Hey, you like crayons?

434
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,879
You want to draw?
It's right over there.

435
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:45,188
Okay. Okay, be good.

436
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:48,051
Have fun. Um, hey, listen.
Don't let his mom find him, okay?

437
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,904
- She wants to run off with him.
- Why would she do that?

438
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:55,842
My dad's wife, Vanessa...

439
00:23:56,924 --> 00:23:58,560
I think that she killed your mom.

440
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:01,437
I'm really sorry.

441
00:24:02,193 --> 00:24:04,207
I got to go. I'll be right back.

442
00:24:04,332 --> 00:24:05,503
Noah, be good.

443
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,197
You bitch.

444
00:24:28,322 --> 00:24:29,966
Ah, sweetheart.

445
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,834
I did you a favor.

446
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,383
Don't you want to know

447
00:24:33,508 --> 00:24:35,838
your husband is a lying,
cheating pig?

448
00:24:35,963 --> 00:24:38,141
He lied and cheated because of you.

449
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,977
Maybe if you had kept him satisfied,

450
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:44,022
he wouldn't have turned to
old flames to fill the void.

451
00:24:47,223 --> 00:24:48,150
Oh, my God.

452
00:24:53,748 --> 00:24:55,158
You really are a whore.

453
00:24:56,717 --> 00:24:58,036
Takes one to know one.

454
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,455
MancinI men are
irresistible, aren't they?

455
00:25:03,124 --> 00:25:04,300
Secret's out, Vanessa.

456
00:25:04,425 --> 00:25:06,875
Boy get pretty chatty
when he's drunk.

457
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:09,505
That was a long time ago.

458
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,133
Michael and I weren't even married.

459
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:15,494
It was five years ago,
according to David.

460
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:20,277
By the way, isn't Noah five?

461
00:26:28,657 --> 00:26:31,301
{\PUB}Heller is a businessman. Maybe
he's just playing it cool.

462
00:26:31,426 --> 00:26:33,403
Not let anyone know
what he's thinking.

463
00:26:33,528 --> 00:26:36,385
Isn't that, like,
a negotiating tactic?

464
00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:39,430
You know what? I don't care
what any producer thinks.

465
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,978
I'm getting married tonight.

466
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:44,852
That's, like, way more exciting
than any Hollywood
deal could ever be.

467
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:46,807
All right?

468
00:26:49,077 --> 00:26:50,788
Perfect!

469
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:53,690
You haven't left yet.

470
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,260
How'd you find us?

471
00:26:56,385 --> 00:26:59,196
Power of loopt. The news I have

472
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:01,431
has to be hand-delivered.

473
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:03,000
Jonah Miller, it is official.

474
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,701
You are no longer
a struggling wannabe.

475
00:27:05,994 --> 00:27:07,704
Curtis Heller wants
to buy your movie!

476
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:08,939
What?

477
00:27:09,064 --> 00:27:10,140
Yeah!

478
00:27:10,265 --> 00:27:12,276
He wa...

479
00:27:12,401 --> 00:27:13,477
Wha...

480
00:27:13,602 --> 00:27:15,379
How could that guy
want to buy my pitch?

481
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:16,547
He was brain-dead.

482
00:27:16,672 --> 00:27:19,516
Well, obviously,
he had a resurrection.

483
00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:22,452
And he wants to make
a deal immediately.

484
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:24,588
Oh, my God.

485
00:27:24,713 --> 00:27:25,856
Jonah!

486
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:26,990
This is unbelievable.

487
00:27:27,115 --> 00:27:28,225
Oh, my God.

488
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,295
Now we have something
else to celebrate in Vegas.

489
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,596
Ooh, yeah. About that.

490
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:33,964
He wants you to pitch it
to the studio on Thursday.

491
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:34,986
Perfect.

492
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:36,600
We'll be back by then.

493
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:38,602
Uh, yeah, but don't you want to
have time to work on the pitch?

494
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:40,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll do it in Vegas.

495
00:27:40,295 --> 00:27:41,872
No. You'll be too distracted.

496
00:27:41,997 --> 00:27:43,740
- No, I won't.
- Jonah, Vegas can wait.

497
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:45,371
What? No.

498
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:47,331
The movie can wait. Riley.

499
00:27:47,602 --> 00:27:49,542
We're getting married tonight.

500
00:27:49,805 --> 00:27:51,548
Civilian unrest at WPK.

501
00:27:51,673 --> 00:27:54,318
Amanda's flying back to
town on her broomstick

502
00:27:54,443 --> 00:27:56,048
for a soiree tomorrow night.

503
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:58,455
I got to go. But I
will see you two later.

504
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,290
And, Jonah, congrats.

505
00:28:00,415 --> 00:28:02,138
- Thanks, Ella. Okay.
- Call me.

506
00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:11,224
Riley...

507
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:12,523
What's going on?

508
00:28:12,794 --> 00:28:14,605
What do you mean?

509
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,777
This is a once in a
lifetime chance for you.

510
00:28:17,065 --> 00:28:20,077
Right. I kind of thought...

511
00:28:20,202 --> 00:28:22,713
us getting married was
once in a lifetime, too.

512
00:28:22,838 --> 00:28:26,250
I mean, it's not like our
engagement expires at midnight.

513
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,952
If it doesn't happen today,
it will happen another time.

514
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:31,355
Or not ever?

515
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,180
Would that be better for you?

516
00:28:40,322 --> 00:28:42,432
What's go... is this
about your mom again?

517
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:45,402
I mean, we can have the
big wedding in Boston.

518
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:47,337
We can have the little
wedding in Boston.

519
00:28:47,462 --> 00:28:50,374
Like, wherever it is,
whenever it is, I don't care.

520
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:53,977
Just figure it out.

521
00:28:54,102 --> 00:28:56,246
It's not about the wedding.

522
00:28:56,371 --> 00:28:57,781
It's not about my mom.

523
00:28:57,906 --> 00:28:58,982
It's about...

524
00:28:59,107 --> 00:29:00,408
It's about me!

525
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,920
Jonah, I love you.

526
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:05,756
I do. But...

527
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:08,516
Too much had happened
since we got engaged. I...

528
00:29:09,818 --> 00:29:11,361
I mean, look at me.

529
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:14,298
I'm unemployed, uninspired.

530
00:29:14,423 --> 00:29:16,300
I feel completely lost.

531
00:29:16,425 --> 00:29:18,035
I just...

532
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,237
I don't know how
I'm supposed to commit

533
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:22,005
to sharing the rest
of my life with someone

534
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,598
when I don't even know
what kind of life I want.

535
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:28,001
Wow.

536
00:29:29,504 --> 00:29:32,604
I'm so sorry.

537
00:29:33,008 --> 00:29:34,885
I don't want to hurt you, Jonah.

538
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,145
I'm just scared.

539
00:29:39,915 --> 00:29:41,815
Well...

540
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:44,051
Okay.

541
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:46,954
If you're so...

542
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,400
afraid, then

543
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:52,626
I'll give you something
to calm your nerves.

544
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:56,573
No more wedding, no more us.

545
00:29:56,698 --> 00:29:58,398
Jonah.

546
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:03,146
Jonah, where are you going?

547
00:30:03,271 --> 00:30:04,414
How are you going to get home?

548
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:06,540
I'll find a way.

549
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:14,758
Lauren.

550
00:30:14,883 --> 00:30:16,783
Lauren!

551
00:30:16,952 --> 00:30:18,662
Okay. Hey. Hey.

552
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:19,817
Lauren, wake up.

553
00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:22,056
Wake up.

554
00:30:26,294 --> 00:30:27,795
Okay. Hey.

555
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:41,308
I just love that.

556
00:30:49,117 --> 00:30:50,818
Can I help you?

557
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:53,163
Wait.

558
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:54,598
I know you.

559
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:55,799
You've been to my house.

560
00:30:55,924 --> 00:30:58,235
You work at larchmont staffing.

561
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,403
Small world.

562
00:30:59,528 --> 00:31:01,838
You know my stepson,
David, from upstairs?

563
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:05,242
You wouldn't happen to have
seen him with my son, Noah?

564
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:08,245
No. Haven't seen him at all.

565
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,313
That's odd because I could
have sworn that I heard

566
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:12,649
my son's voice coming
from inside your apartment.

567
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:14,742
Just me.

568
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:18,388
My son is in there, isn't he?

569
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:20,123
I don't know what
you're talking about.

570
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:21,458
Get the hell out of my way.

571
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,126
You gonna kill me?

572
00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:25,896
Just like you killed my mom?

573
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:29,690
Sydney Andrews was my mother.

574
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:32,893
Hmm.

575
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:34,504
You poor thing.

576
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:37,007
She was the only person
who ever loved me.

577
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:38,866
And you took her away.

578
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:45,482
Let me guess.
You're here to evict me.

579
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:46,707
No.

580
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:51,545
Uh...

581
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:54,491
Turning my back on you was

582
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:56,693
the biggest mistake of my life,

583
00:31:56,818 --> 00:31:57,861
and I'm so sorry.

584
00:31:57,986 --> 00:32:00,130
The minute you told
me, I knew it was true.

585
00:32:00,255 --> 00:32:02,332
You are my daughter, Violet.

586
00:32:02,457 --> 00:32:03,857
And I want...

587
00:32:06,428 --> 00:32:09,463
I would like to get to know you.

588
00:32:18,073 --> 00:32:19,783
How could you kill her?

589
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:21,358
Give me my son now!

590
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:24,287
I am warning you.

591
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:26,046
Get out of my way.

592
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:19,747
She killed my mom.

593
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,603
It's gonna be okay.

594
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:32,479
So, did she attack you?

595
00:33:32,604 --> 00:33:35,115
Miss Foster, did she attack you?

596
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,346
She had a gun.

597
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:37,640
And she threatened you with the gun?

598
00:33:37,876 --> 00:33:39,599
She started to pull
it from her purse.

599
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:41,977
I saw everything, detective.

600
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:43,603
It was clearly self-defense.

601
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,730
That woman would have
killed her. Detective.

602
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:47,566
If Violet didn't fight
back, she'd have been dead.

603
00:33:47,786 --> 00:33:48,695
Excuse me one second.

604
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,486
I don't know how to thank you.

605
00:33:51,723 --> 00:33:53,433
Don't worry, sweetheart.

606
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:54,990
Someday you'll find a way.

607
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:01,371
Lauren, hang on!
You're gonna make it!

608
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,540
Oh, God, Lauren.

609
00:34:03,802 --> 00:34:05,792
Get her into seven.
What happened to her?

610
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:08,003
I don't know. I found her in a
hotel room. She was passed out.

611
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,484
We need a urine tox screen, CBC
and chem panel. Lfts and coags.

612
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:11,340
What's wrong with her?!

613
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:12,466
Start a gastric lavage.

614
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:13,675
Is she gonna be okay?

615
00:34:13,912 --> 00:34:14,510
What is wrong with her?

616
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:16,680
It looks like an overdose.

617
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:31,104
You scared me.

618
00:34:31,229 --> 00:34:32,929
Sorry.

619
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,975
It's pretty surreal, isn't it?

620
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,408
Another body being carried out?

621
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,575
Aren't you supposed

622
00:34:39,804 --> 00:34:42,282
to be in Vegas right now?

623
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:45,652
Kind of had a change of plans.

624
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:48,001
We're not getting married.

625
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:58,131
I'm sorry, Riley.

626
00:34:58,256 --> 00:35:00,333
I really am.

627
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:03,236
I guess, better now

628
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:04,435
than after you go through a wedding,

629
00:35:04,663 --> 00:35:08,074
been married...

630
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:11,502
I strung him along
for how many months?

631
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:15,248
How could I do that to him?

632
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:18,952
You wereonfused, that's all.

633
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:22,322
And I can't help but admit that...

634
00:35:22,447 --> 00:35:24,162
This is all for the best.

635
00:35:27,385 --> 00:35:29,396
What you said this morning,

636
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:31,565
maybe you were right,

637
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,546
but that doesn't
mean that any of this

638
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:36,436
is for the best.

639
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:38,968
I know you weren't
meant to be with him.

640
00:35:40,131 --> 00:35:41,596
What?

641
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,976
Tell me I'm wrong, Riley.

642
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:45,141
Tell me you don't feel the same way.

643
00:35:55,747 --> 00:35:57,236
Auggie, stop.

644
00:35:57,415 --> 00:35:59,315
Look...

645
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:02,825
You need to leave... now.

646
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:22,720
Oh, hey, superstar.

647
00:36:22,907 --> 00:36:24,514
Wait a minute.

648
00:36:24,709 --> 00:36:26,975
How did you track me down?

649
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,348
Works both ways.

650
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:33,314
Aha.

651
00:36:33,518 --> 00:36:36,763
You look like you got run
over by a freight train.

652
00:36:36,888 --> 00:36:38,653
What happened?

653
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:42,826
Riley and I broke up.

654
00:36:44,062 --> 00:36:46,230
Like, really broke up.

655
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:51,624
Oh, my God, Jonah, I'm so sorry.

656
00:36:51,803 --> 00:36:54,103
Don't be.

657
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:58,618
It's probably all for the best.

658
00:36:58,743 --> 00:37:00,286
She never wanted to get married.

659
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:03,970
I was just a sucker
being strung along.

660
00:37:04,149 --> 00:37:08,015
Jonah, you're not a sucker.

661
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:10,601
You guys had some
amazing times together.

662
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,290
Yeah.

663
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:18,104
But I mean, at the end of the day,

664
00:37:18,229 --> 00:37:20,907
after all those years,
she couldn't imagine

665
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:22,405
a future with me?

666
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:25,575
I don't think
she ever really got me.

667
00:37:26,738 --> 00:37:28,148
And you were right.

668
00:37:28,273 --> 00:37:31,956
We are just two completely
different people.

669
00:37:32,143 --> 00:37:34,959
A total miss as a couple.

670
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:39,117
Hey, do not let Riley's
flip-flop take away

671
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:42,925
from the fact that you
accomplished your dream today.

672
00:37:45,824 --> 00:37:48,435
You're right.

673
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,336
Yes, I did.

674
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:51,771
Yes, you did.

675
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:54,228
This should be the
greatest night of my life.

676
00:37:54,432 --> 00:37:56,332
Mm-hmm.

677
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:02,282
And I should be with someone

678
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:05,239
who believes in me.

679
00:38:05,443 --> 00:38:09,447
Someone who just
trusts my every move.

680
00:38:10,448 --> 00:38:14,294
Someone who can just look
me directly in the eye

681
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:16,834
without a shred of
doubt or hesitation.

682
00:38:23,294 --> 00:38:25,134
Jonah, wait.

683
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:28,932
Just this once,
just don't talk, okay?

684
00:39:03,701 --> 00:39:05,912
All right, tomorrow then.

685
00:39:06,037 --> 00:39:09,439
I'll finally get to see if
it's in one of these apartments.

686
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:12,846
Wait.

687
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:13,951
Wait!

688
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:16,912
I don't want to be
just a one-night stand.

689
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:18,976
You're not.

690
00:40:20,078 --> 00:40:22,293
No, Jonah, Jonah, I'm serious.

691
00:40:23,748 --> 00:40:25,421
Are you sure you want to do this?

692
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:29,592
Yes, I'm sure.
