1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,292
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,919
Schools for Educational
Evolution and Development.

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:07,825
SEED schools. One way or another,
I will make this school happen,

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,967
even if I have to raise
every penny by myself.

5
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:12,345
<i>Amanda does not come all
the way across the country</i>

6
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,139
- just to slap us on the wrist.
- She's the president of WPK.

7
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,975
Jonah Miller, I would like
you to meet Curtis Heller.

8
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:21,354
- This better be good.
- Curtis Heller wants to buy your movie!

9
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:23,996
Stealing art?

10
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,666
<i>Isn't that kind of a twisted
way to make a living?</i>

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,737
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I know you're the embezzler.

12
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,615
And it appears that you've stolen
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

13
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:35,785
I overheard you talking to Jo.
You set me up.

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,287
You don't get to do whatever
you want with Riley anymore.

15
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:40,081
She's not your girlfriend.

16
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,755
Six months ago, I fell behind
in my tuition payments.

17
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:51,717
I had sex for money.
I was a prostitute.

18
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:05,731
- You see that star right there?
- What star right there?

19
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,709
The big, bright one.
Next to that cluster of little ones.

20
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:15,157
- They all look exactly the same.
- My God, you're blind. Right there.

21
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:23,789
Did you seriously just fall for
the oldest trick in the book?

22
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,029
You are hilarious.
And so dead.

23
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:32,164
Okay, stop.

24
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:36,011
The last thing my fundraiser needs
is a host with severe chlorine hair.

25
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,346
Truce.

26
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:38,804
Fine.

27
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:42,476
I don't care what your hair looks like.
You're gonna kick so much ass tomorrow.

28
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,300
You'll be breaking ground
on that dream school

29
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:47,638
before those zillionaires
can say "tax deduction".

30
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:48,733
We'll see.

31
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,283
Ben Brinkley's friends go
to dozens of these things.

32
00:01:51,408 --> 00:01:52,985
I hope they don't show up and think

33
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,573
that the "Child Inside Us"
theme is completely ridiculous.

34
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,824
Are yodding me? How often do these
people get to loosen their ties

35
00:01:58,949 --> 00:02:00,505
and go nuts on a bouncy castle?

36
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,199
They'll be shoveling money
at the Seed Foundation.

37
00:02:03,554 --> 00:02:05,446
Trust your instincts.

38
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:23,401
Hospital?

39
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,228
I don't hear anything.

40
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:31,343
- Good-bye.
- See you tomorrow.

41
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:36,238
It's Drew...

42
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:38,532
Give me 20.

43
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:43,016
Ella Bella, you are not
gonna believe this.

44
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:45,580
Curtis Heller invited me
into a casting session

45
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:48,542
for Living in Reverse.
How awesome is that?

46
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,129
Hey, Jonah. Will you...

47
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:55,714
show me how to do something?

48
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,698
Kind of looks like you know
exactly what you're doing here.

49
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:05,416
There are a few things that you
know how to do better than me...

50
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:07,624
Really?

51
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:12,389
- Name one.
- For... example...

52
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,967
Computers.

53
00:03:17,257 --> 00:03:19,943
And since you've accessed
the WPK server before,

54
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:22,070
I thought that you...

55
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:24,745
could teach me how to get in

56
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,039
so I could delete the illegal billings
that Amanda's using to frame me with.

57
00:03:28,764 --> 00:03:31,116
Whoa. Ella, wait. Stop.

58
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,430
If there's one thing I learned from
my single day of employment at WPK,

59
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:37,389
it's to keep my nose out of
other people's megabytes.

60
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:40,344
Jonah, do you see what I'm wearing?

61
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,709
Yes, and I love it.

62
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:45,155
Now picture this covered
in a prison jumpsuit.

63
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,132
That's Amanda's plan.

64
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:49,770
Which is exactly why I've been
urging you to get a lawyer.

65
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:52,500
You can't undo one illegal
action with another.

66
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,900
Not going to win you any
favors with the judge.

67
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,376
You're talking as if
I'm gonna get caught.

68
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,379
But if you teach me how,

69
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:02,950
no one will ever have to know.

70
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,725
Even if I showed you how,
it would still be impossible.

71
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,600
All the files are on
Gabe Taylor's computer.

72
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:12,585
- The nerdy accountant?
- He wears glasses, if that's what you mean.

73
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,277
And yeah, without the digital
password on his little key chain,

74
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:17,464
you won't be able to
log onto his desktop.

75
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,099
And let me guess... this key
chain never leaves his side.

76
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,836
It might as well be
nuclear launch codes.

77
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:26,972
He was so jumpy.

78
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:30,060
And then I realized he was
just nervous I'd uncover

79
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,812
his online dating addiction.

80
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,846
Point taken.

81
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:41,030
This salmon's a graveyard.

82
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,557
Another guest finds a bone in his
entree, I will break every one of yours.

83
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:46,201
Do we understand?

84
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,788
- Guests can hear you at the bar.
- What? What the hell is this?

85
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,832
Which one of you morons
destroyed this filet?

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,536
I cut my finger,
and I was getting a Band-Aid.

87
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,921
I don't care if your finger
is dangling by a tendon.

88
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,129
You don't abandon your
station during a rush.

89
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:01,907
I don't know where you worked before,
but this is my ship.

90
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:04,136
- I said that's enough!
- I'm trying to do my job.

91
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,597
You don't have a job.
You're fired.

92
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:09,548
Are you insane?

93
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:12,394
The only reason people come to
this place is to eat my food.

94
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,253
Get out of my restaurant.

95
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:17,480
Good luck staying in business.

96
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:22,793
All right. Yeah. Let's go.

97
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:25,497
- He's flat-lining.
- Come on, Kevin. Stay with me!

98
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:27,921
Charge! Clear!

99
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,996
360. Going again.

100
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,540
- Charge. Clear!
- We've been on him for 45 minutes.

101
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,941
- 360. One more time. Charge.
- It's over, Pragin.

102
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,337
Come on.

103
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,680
Come on, Kevin. Come on!

104
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:46,240
I'm calling it.
Time of death: 10:55.

105
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:49,253
He's gone, Drew.

106
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:52,597
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:12,204
I thought I saw you walk in here.
What are you doing?

108
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:17,082
- Did you just take his blood?
- Yeah, I did.

109
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:19,795
- Why?
- Research.

110
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,423
It's part of the hematology program.

111
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,376
Did you get
the consent of his family?

112
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:32,723
- What are you, the hall monitor?
- What if the chief resident found out

113
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:35,992
one of his students was sneaking
around blood in his lab coat?

114
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,707
Look, if there's
anyone who understands

115
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:43,318
how to keep a secret, it's you.

116
00:06:45,216 --> 00:06:48,282
Now, I didn't ask you any questions
because I'm sure you had your reasons.

117
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:53,043
Well, I've got mine.

118
00:06:55,332 --> 00:07:01,253
***********************CREDITS**********************

119
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,116
I'm here in the flesh this time,
not just some disembodied voice

120
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:17,800
leaving unreturned phone messages.

121
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:19,021
Look, it's not

122
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,201
that I didn't want to talk to you.
I just didn't know what to say.

123
00:07:23,072 --> 00:07:25,304
- To anybody.
- What about "Help"?

124
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:27,709
You're my best friend, Lauren.

125
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:29,809
If you needed money or
advice or a shoulder,

126
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,366
that's where I come in.

127
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,780
As my best friend, Riley,
you know how difficult it is

128
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:35,314
for me to admit to failure.

129
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:39,118
Struggling to pay for med
school isn't failure, Lauren.

130
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,126
And all of those
unreturned voice mails

131
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,474
were to let you know that what happened
doesn't change a single thing between us.

132
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,350
You're my best friend,
no matter what.

133
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:53,365
Oh, thank you.

134
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:01,206
How's David doing with everything?

135
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,477
How am I going to get him
to trust me again, Riley?

136
00:08:04,602 --> 00:08:07,747
- He won't even look at me.
- You find a way to talk to him.

137
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:09,824
Let him know how you feel.

138
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:13,367
Where are you off to so fast?

139
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,702
You know, Hugo's serves
breakfast all day.

140
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,496
I fired Marcello last night,

141
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,041
and I found out that he took three chefs,
my hostess, and my bartender with him.

142
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,210
- Oh, my God.
- The kitchen must be insane.

143
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,087
If it's not on fire yet.
Wish me luck.

144
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,212
Good luck.

145
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,183
Let me give you a hand.

146
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,519
- I got it, actually.
- Right. Of course.

147
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:42,043
Totally capable.

148
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:44,745
Never thanked you for donating

149
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,224
that "Day on the set with Owen
Anderson" for the auction.

150
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:49,069
- That was sweet.
- It was nothing.

151
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,764
You're the one doing everything.

152
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:55,461
Man, those kids at the school are lucky
you're going to be looking out for them.

153
00:08:55,586 --> 00:08:56,660
Thanks, Jonah.

154
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:01,915
That's either

155
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,042
the most awkward yoga
outfit I've ever seen

156
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,919
or today's definitely not Saturday.

157
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,907
I'm totally cheating
on my Bikram class

158
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:09,715
for this work lunch.

159
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:16,803
But I am going to see the both of you at
that fundraiser doohickey thingy, yeah?

160
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,974
- Can't wait.
- Good.

161
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:27,551
Don't you dare get any ideas
on that casting couch today,

162
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:28,984
got it?

163
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:30,361
Got it.

164
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:38,327
<i> I know it's a little
unconventional,</i>

165
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,840
but since our casting
director has swine flu,

166
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,999
I thought maybe you could read,
Jacob's part with the girls.

167
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:46,153
Are you serious? I would love that.

168
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,081
There he is.
Simon, how are you?

169
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:51,350
I am ready to finally
cast this thing.

170
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:55,427
- Hey! Jonah's here. Hello.
- What's happening, wunderkind?

171
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:58,167
Oh, you know,
just trying to wrap my head

172
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:00,349
around the fact that you
are directing my life.

173
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:06,015
You know, like,
major "out of body" going on here...

174
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:08,482
I gotta run down to Eastwood's set.

175
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:11,420
Listen, why don't you guys start
without me? I'll watch the tapes.

176
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,718
You got a lot going on there.

177
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,580
Can you even read the script
through all that?

178
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,248
It's just me riffing.
I had an idea.

179
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,600
I want to change the Halloween
scene to a Valentine's Day party.

180
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:31,553
The-The scene where
Jacob and Rachel meet?

181
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,341
That changes a lot, doesn't it?

182
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,129
But nobody really wants to see
Rachel in a sumo costume, do they?

183
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:39,200
Let's get the girls in here.

184
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,860
Julio, where's my snapper?

185
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,118
- Never got an order.
- We're so short- staffed, David.

186
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:48,667
Are you on table 3?

187
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,089
Hey, David. We have a problem.

188
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:54,611
- There's some jerk smoking.
- I'll take care of it.

189
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,882
And guests with reservations
have been waiting forever.

190
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,116
- What do I tell them?
- Make something up.

191
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,387
Okay, everybody,
cocktails on the house.

192
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:04,538
Help me out.
Thank you all for waiting.

193
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,059
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm lending you a hand.

194
00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:10,419
Wilson, party of eight? If you guys
don't mind being on two separate tables,

195
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,796
- I can seat you right now.
- Cool with that?

196
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,152
Come on. Thanks, guys.

197
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:34,943
Gabe Taylor.

198
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:37,029
Are you up for a matinee?

199
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,251
Ella, hey, no, I'm actually...
I'm-I'm waiting for someone.

200
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:44,530
- StatsGirl183, by chance?
- How did you know that?

201
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,789
Because I am your date to
Starkiller's Truce.

202
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:51,168
You're StatsGirl? You...

203
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,337
You don't look anything
like her profile pic.

204
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,003
I pretty much cropped that
off my friend's Facebook page.

205
00:11:56,406 --> 00:11:57,094
What?

206
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:00,024
You know how WPK feels
about interoffice dating.

207
00:12:00,771 --> 00:12:03,388
This was the only way I
could get you to meet me.

208
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:05,284
I-I don't get it.

209
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:07,953
You're like this trendy
Hollywood socialite.

210
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,823
And I'm just some numbers geek.
I mean, we have nothing in common.

211
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:12,230
You see, I hate that.

212
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,193
Everybody thinks I'm
this Barney's rack,

213
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,328
but really, if they would
stop and get to know me,

214
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:18,631
they would see that I am a
Battlestar watching nerd

215
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:21,948
- with a wicked Halo game.
- You watch Battlestar Galactica?

216
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,368
Oh, yeah,
Starbucks and I are like this.

217
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:27,829
Do not let the Gucci
and the guest lists fool you.

218
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:30,893
PR's competitive.
I have to act the part.

219
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:36,922
Holy cow, your forearms are bionic.

220
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:44,721
No, no, just...
just standard human issue.

221
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:46,973
What's the name of your gym?

222
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,296
My gym? I... I-I
haven't been in a gym

223
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:52,231
since I nearly died
from a bloody nose

224
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,523
- during dodgeball.
- All right, get out your car keys.

225
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,358
I will bet you a family-sized

226
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,903
popcorn that there is a gym
card right next to your car key.

227
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,285
Grocery clubs and
library memberships.

228
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,614
I, um... I like a lot
of butter on my popcorn.

229
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,502
I guess we have a few
things in common, then.

230
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:32,385
- What's wrong?
- Look around.

231
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,854
The bouncy's empty.

232
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,730
No one's tried the
finger-painting wall.

233
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,157
Clearly the "Child Inside
Us" theme isn't working.

234
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,488
Now, look, the, uh,
silent auction's in full effect.

235
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,913
This one guy seems
interested in everything.

236
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:48,534
"Oliver Clothesoff."

237
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,104
What a cool guy to get the
bidding starting like that.

238
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:53,239
You know, it's weird.

239
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:55,212
He was generous enough
to bid on everything

240
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:56,734
except for Jonah's donation.

241
00:13:58,221 --> 00:13:59,558
My guess is Oliver

242
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:01,914
didn't want to encourage
anything about that.

243
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:04,951
About what? Charity?

244
00:14:05,772 --> 00:14:08,847
Riley, it's painfully obvious
Jonah's not over you.

245
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:12,158
And his donation is just
one of the dozen ways

246
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:15,437
- he's gonna try to win you back.
- Win me back?

247
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,877
You can concoct your crazy
theories all you want.

248
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:20,003
I need to deal with the fact
that this fundraiser

249
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:22,694
- is inducing comas on its guests.
- Just you wait.

250
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,489
Excuse me, ma'am.
Have you ever been in a bouncy?

251
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:27,032
In a what?

252
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,034
- My God, Drew, no.
- That castle over there.

253
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:33,288
What do you say we let our
hair down and get our jump on?

254
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:47,660
Hot pot, behind. Does anyone
know where we keep the pepper?

255
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:50,029
Julio, Julio, okay,
I need two specials,

256
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:52,307
- and where'risotto for 12?
- I don't know.

257
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,685
Is this really how
you want to spend your days off?

258
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,602
You know me-
always up for a good triage.

259
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:58,200
Trust me, all right?

260
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:00,858
Four summers waitressing at the
Quarter Bistro in Cincinnati,

261
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,642
you pick up a few things.

262
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:05,195
I know you're trying to help.
I've got it under control.

263
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:10,016
Please don't tell me those
were the crabs for 15.

264
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,853
Okay, guys, I already lied and
told them they were on the way.

265
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:16,498
Well, I'm sure that you had
them in the palm of your hand.

266
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:26,153
I never thought I'd see
Starkiller's Truce with Ella Simms.

267
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:30,415
And I never thought they could stretch
out the search for a missing galaxy

268
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,254
into two and a half hours.

269
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:40,063
Brr, wow, I wish I
would've brought a jacket.

270
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:43,028
Really? I'm kind of sweaty.

271
00:15:46,703 --> 00:15:49,622
So, um, would you like to go
for an afternoon cocktail?

272
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:54,034
Ella, you're really hot.
Oh, thank you.

273
00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:57,063
And if this were high school,
I'd be panting right now.

274
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:02,377
But I'm pushing 30,
and looking to settle down.

275
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:05,972
And, uh, you're not exactly the girl

276
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:08,174
I picture bringing
home to Mom and Dad.

277
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:10,669
So, I'm sorry.

278
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,581
- Are you, uh, are you okay?
- Oh, God, yeah.

279
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,730
Yes, I'm fine. I get it.

280
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,947
You're dumping me... in the Valley.

281
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:27,152
I guess, uh, I'll see you in
the halls.

282
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:33,207
Actually...

283
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:49,007
I'm sorry, I guess I just...

284
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:51,307
couldn't help myself.

285
00:16:58,482 --> 00:16:59,523
Toodles!

286
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:14,574
- I think I know how to change a flat...
- tire, and guess what? That's not it.

287
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,951
Since when are you God's
gift to roadside emergencies?

288
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,704
Since the alternative seems
to be standing here...

289
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,648
... waiting for the tire to
magically reinflate itself.

290
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,687
Now, give me the jack.

291
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,262
Oh, my God! Y...

292
00:17:28,387 --> 00:17:31,216
You just totally changed that tire.

293
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:32,717
You're amazing.

294
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,970
I love you. Now we'll actually
make it to Tenacious D on time.

295
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:40,993
- Wait a second.
- Did you just say that you love me?

296
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,837
Just sort of slipped out.

297
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,777
- How was that?
- That was great.

298
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,280
Thank you very much.

299
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,277
- Really well done.
- Thank you.

300
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:01,329
I mean, that actually
made my stomach hurt.

301
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,622
You know, I want to
rewrite that scene

302
00:18:03,747 --> 00:18:06,539
so the love thing isn't just
like a slip of the tongue.

303
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,665
Oh, but that's kind
of the whole point.

304
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,895
Yeah, but it's not landing.
None of the girls felt it. 

305
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:14,867
I'm just gonna go out on a limb here

306
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:17,169
and say they weren't feeling
it because they can't act.

307
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,764
What are you talking about?

308
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,558
Wendy Bledsoe,
the second to last girl, she's perfect.

309
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:29,983
I totally respect that you're
the director here.

310
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,359
It's just,

311
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,713
the character of Rachel has to just 

312
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:36,704
radiate warmth.

313
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:41,953
And be funny and loving,
and she cares about other people.

314
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:46,433
I don't know-We have to find
an actress with her soul.

315
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,934
Look, man, I'm sorry, you know.

316
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:52,380
I tried to give you a shot, but,
you're off the project.

317
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,221
Somebody will be by to
take your order shortly.

318
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,471
Thank you.

319
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:08,563
What is this?
You're playing hostess?

320
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,621
David's short-staffed.
I'm helping him out.

321
00:19:10,746 --> 00:19:12,859
Lor, no one volunteers to
deal with a hungry public

322
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,319
without an ulterior motive.

323
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,113
If you're trying to win him back,

324
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,032
just make sure your next
paying job requires an I-9.

325
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:22,034
Not funny, El.

326
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,662
I know we never
really talked about that thing

327
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,956
that we haven't been talking
about this whole time,

328
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,774
but... I know you had your reasons.

329
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:32,682
And I love you, no matter what.

330
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:37,425
Let's not let this change
anything between us.

331
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,689
I would love that.

332
00:19:47,122 --> 00:19:48,032
There you go.

333
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:49,834
That isn't actually sweat...

334
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,941
- on your forehead, is it?
- If you're here to help,

335
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,501
there's some aprons in the back,
you can bus some tables.

336
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:57,122
I don't know what that means.

337
00:19:57,247 --> 00:20:00,073
Anyway, I'm here to engage
you in a teeny-weeny,

338
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,999
- almost nonexistent favor.
- I'm a little busy here, El.

339
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,502
Well, not now, obviously.
After work.

340
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,206
Okay, look, I need to break

341
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,283
into WPK to take my name off the
fabricated accounting reports,

342
00:20:11,408 --> 00:20:14,277
and I don't exactly know how to
work my way around a lock-pick.

343
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,921
- And I do?
- You didn't

344
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:18,842
have a problem MacGyvering your way
around your dads highly-secured mansion.

345
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,526
That was a one-time thing.

346
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,361
Amanda is three mouse-clicks away

347
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:24,947
from sending me to prison,
okay? I have to fight this.

348
00:20:25,072 --> 00:20:28,893
We're gonna deal with this later.
Can you please make yourself useful?

349
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,974
Go to table 8 and take
their drink order.

350
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:35,817
Hello, can I offer...

351
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,991
Can I offer you a beverage?

352
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:43,533
I feel like I need a shot of
whiskey just to get through

353
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,751
this martini menu, but, um...

354
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,247
I think I've decided either
on the Classic Ginger

355
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,250
- or the Thin Mint.
- Ooh, both are delicious.

356
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,211
I personally am a Cucumber girl.

357
00:20:56,073 --> 00:20:57,563
But you know what?

358
00:20:57,688 --> 00:21:01,158
Why don't I bring out all three
and you can decide for yourself?

359
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,937
If I didn't know better, I would think
that you were trying to get me drunk.

360
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,723
I'll be right back.

361
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,517
Do you have any idea who's sittin table
8?

362
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,477
That's Bernadette Reese.

363
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,437
Who?

364
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:16,232
Only the most important food
critic in town. Look, David,

365
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,234
 if she writes Coal a bad review, 

366
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,348
all of your hard work will be for
nothing.

367
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:22,697
 This place will close overnight.

368
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,369
Table 8, Alaskan halibut. 

369
00:21:31,985 --> 00:21:33,261
Quick tutorial.

370
00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:35,576
Bernadette likes her plates
clean and her food simple.

371
00:21:35,701 --> 00:21:37,766
Whatever this shot glass
thingy of foam is, bye-bye.

372
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:39,464
Hold on. You're sure about this?

373
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:42,425
 Yes,
WPK did publicity for her book.

374
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:46,541
Now, Julio what is
happening with this garnish?

375
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,276
- It's a radish basket.
- Lose it.

376
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:51,768
What are we in? No! 1940s Russia?

377
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,328
Give the woman some veggies,

378
00:21:53,453 --> 00:21:55,225
- for crying out loud.
- She looks hungry.

379
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,319
- Let's move it, people.
- All right, let's go.

380
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:03,237
Your Alaskan halibut.
Enjoy your meal.

381
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,972
I can't watch.

382
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:22,173
Come on.

383
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,552
Is that a smile?

384
00:22:28,491 --> 00:22:31,166
Oh, that looked like a wince.
You know what, guys?

385
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,309
Whatever she writes...
good or bad...

386
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,716
- I appreciate the help.
- Come on, look at all the happy faces.

387
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,731
This place is Yelp-proof.

388
00:22:39,365 --> 00:22:41,275
Not like you could have
done it without me.

389
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:45,154
But be ready tonight.
And bring a flashlight.

390
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:12,765
Thank you. You guys rock.
We're gonna take a breather.

391
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,602
If you want to keep this blood flowing,
the potato sack races start in ten.

392
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:21,607
Where were you when I had a
classroom full of first graders?

393
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,610
Did you see Mrs. Erickson stage-dive
to "Mary Had a Little Lamb"?

394
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:27,363
Look at this place.
There's a lineup to the bouncy.

395
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,629
I think I saw a millionaire
eating a Dippin' Stick,

396
00:23:29,754 --> 00:23:31,993
and the auction brought in{\ so
much }more money than I thought.

397
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,412
Did you see the bidding war
over Jonah's "Day on the Set"?

398
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:42,211
You know what?
This auction's not over yet.

399
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,243
What are you doing?

400
00:23:47,353 --> 00:23:50,386
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
Can I get your attention?

401
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:53,848
Now I know the silent
auction is closed,

402
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,851
but we have one more item
for your bidding pleasure.

403
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:58,269
We do?

404
00:23:58,498 --> 00:24:01,439
This band that's been
rocking your face off

405
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,486
all day...

406
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:05,234
will do a private show
for the highest bidder.

407
00:24:06,295 --> 00:24:09,527
So let's get this
bidding started at $100.

408
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:15,204
$50.

409
00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:23,939
Now how about something you
guys may actually want? 

410
00:24:24,366 --> 00:24:28,257
A date with our beautiful
host with the cutest dimple...

411
00:24:28,528 --> 00:24:31,719
- Miss Riley Richmond.
- What?! No, please, Drew, don't.

412
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,943
I'll start the bidding off at $200.
Who can beat me?

413
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:37,912
- I'm so going to kill you.
- I know.

414
00:24:38,037 --> 00:24:40,236
$250, anyone? $250.

415
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:41,906
Do I hear $300?

416
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:44,191
$350.

417
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,747
Hey, why didn't you tell
me Bernadette was leaving?

418
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,903
She just paid her bill
in cash and bolted.

419
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:07,630
Great. Try and make an honest living,
and I can't even last a week.

420
00:25:11,457 --> 00:25:12,664
You're doing fine.

421
00:25:13,469 --> 00:25:15,750
The food here is excellent,
and your guests

422
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,031
don't even know you're
understaffed today.

423
00:25:18,156 --> 00:25:20,518
Lauren, I appreciate what you're doing,
okay? I do.

424
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,256
But how am I supposed to believe

425
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:24,981
a single word you say,
when all you ever did was lie to me?

426
00:25:26,382 --> 00:25:28,484
- You think that's what I wanted?
- It doesn't matter.

427
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,127
Turns out that I never
knew you at all, so...

428
00:25:33,396 --> 00:25:34,306
You're right.

429
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:38,411
You don't know me.

430
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,437
Nobody knows me.

431
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:49,868
I was never good
enough for my father.

432
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:54,057
If I'd bring home a 98%,
he'd ask me why it wasn't 100.

433
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:56,838
I got into ULA... why not Harvard?

434
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:01,259
I wanted him to accept me.

435
00:26:03,457 --> 00:26:07,135
So if you're wondering why
I put myself through hell

436
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,745
night after night, 

437
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:11,944
hating myself
through every horrible moment,

438
00:26:12,607 --> 00:26:13,988
it was so I could bring home

439
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,241
that M.D. and prove to him
that I'm worthy of his love.

440
00:26:20,642 --> 00:26:23,224
And that's not an
excuse for hurting you.

441
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:29,186
But now you know who I am.

442
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:42,516
$750. $800.

443
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,518
Did I just hear $800?

444
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,407
Now, people,
hold on to your pensions.

445
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:49,607
- I'm going to make a bid.
- I can't believe this is happening.

446
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,276
- $850... do I hear $850?
- Drew, no, that's way too much.

447
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:54,904
$900. $1,000.

448
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,118
$1,000 from Mr. Hollywood himself.

449
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,744
Riley, I can't compete with that.

450
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:05,331
- Good. This is crazy.
- All right, $1,000 going once...

451
00:27:05,747 --> 00:27:07,344
- Come on.
- Going twice...

452
00:27:07,469 --> 00:27:08,533
$2,000.

453
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,846
Now that is a date I would
pay two grand to watch.

454
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,934
$2,000, going once...
going twice...

455
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,556
Sold to the beautiful blonde
with the mortified boyfriend.

456
00:27:33,998 --> 00:27:36,591
2,000 big ones.
That's awfully generous of you.

457
00:27:36,716 --> 00:27:39,907
Oh, well, you know how passionate
I am about the environment.

458
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,748
This is a fundraiser
for a school program.

459
00:27:42,873 --> 00:27:43,816
Whatever.

460
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:44,996
And besides,

461
00:27:45,683 --> 00:27:49,064
somebody had to save you
from winning a date with Saint Riley.

462
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,729
Oh, that was all in good fun. I was
just trying to up the bid for Drew.

463
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:55,733
Hey, you're not... you're not mad,
are you?

464
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:57,331
 What? Mad? No.

465
00:27:58,725 --> 00:28:00,266
Of course I'm not mad.

466
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:03,723
I mean, that's what I like about you.
A charitable bid on Riley,

467
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,205
a day on the set with Owen Anderson.

468
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,042
You're like Santa Claus,
minus the cholesterol problem.

469
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:10,938
Right.

470
00:28:11,595 --> 00:28:14,307
I'm just trying to help out, you know.
While I still can.

471
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:15,818
Meaning?

472
00:28:16,577 --> 00:28:18,788
Turns out whoever
wins the on-set visit

473
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:22,283
won't be seeing me there.
I was let go.

474
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,271
Oh, my God, what... what happened?

475
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,960
I had this big fight with Simon.

476
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:31,292
And I want to hire someone
who actually has talent, and he wants

477
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,165
 to lobotomize the character.

478
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:36,380
Jonah, I am so sorry.
Clearly, Simon's a hack

479
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,871
who couldn't direct
traffic in the Sahara.

480
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,762
Let me call Curtis Heller
and I will figure this whole thing out.

481
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,444
No, El, don't, please.

482
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:47,475
I need to... I need to work
this out all on my own.

483
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:50,311
What do you say
we just have a night in,

484
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,146
order some pizzas,

485
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,648
and then we make a serious
dent in your TiVo?

486
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,490
Oh... I would love to, but... 

487
00:28:58,084 --> 00:29:00,112
tonight's no good for me.

488
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:02,073
- Why?
- I'm working.

489
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,116
Work? Still? It's Saturday.

490
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,315
I know.

491
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,368
But seven of my clients are
in summer blockbusters,

492
00:29:09,493 --> 00:29:12,416
and well, they all have to be
on the cover of everything,

493
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,336
so unless you're an
Excel spreadsheet

494
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,476
or a caffeinated beverage, I'm...

495
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:19,478
I'm not going to be such
good company tonight.

496
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:22,051
- I'm sorry.
- $2,000?

497
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:23,687
Are you kidding?

498
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:26,472
Courtesy of WPK's charity fund.
I'm on the committee.

499
00:29:26,744 --> 00:29:29,100
And as much as I would
hate to miss out

500
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,772
on a candlelit dinner
and a long walk on the beach,

501
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:35,356
I say we give our date
a permanent rain check.

502
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:37,390
You're not my type. No offense.

503
00:29:37,515 --> 00:29:39,110
- None taken.
- Good.

504
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:42,935
Well, all of this giving
is making me crave vodka.

505
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,615
Excuse me.

506
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:50,329
About that whole bidding thing,
I wasn't trying to stir anything up.

507
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:52,623
- Just having a little fun.
- It was.

508
00:29:53,476 --> 00:29:54,925
Thank you, Jonah, seriously. 

509
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:57,503
The SEED Foundation made
so much money today.

510
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:58,914
Good. You deserve it.

511
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,132
How'd casting go?

512
00:30:01,412 --> 00:30:03,717
It sucked. And then

513
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,713
I got fired from my own movie,
which sucked even more.

514
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:08,313
You're kidding.

515
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:10,474
Why?

516
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:13,150
Actually... casting you. And...

517
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,848
I didn't think...

518
00:30:18,204 --> 00:30:19,950
anyone was good enough.

519
00:30:26,003 --> 00:30:28,914
Look, I don't know anything
about the movie business,

520
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,584
but six months ago the SEED
school was a pipe dream

521
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:33,876
and on Monday I'm
interviewing contractors.

522
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,253
Don't let anyone
take your dream away.

523
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,438
You got a sec?

524
00:30:58,936 --> 00:31:00,816
Do now. Simon called.

525
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:05,196
What's this I hear about
creative differences?

526
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,535
I think Andre the Giant

527
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,287
and Mini-Me would have an easier
time seeing eye to eye on this movie.

528
00:31:09,412 --> 00:31:11,076
I'm really sorry to hear that,
Jonah.

529
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,725
You know, from where I'm sitting

530
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,830
I gave you the opportunity
of a lifetime,

531
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,477
and you blew it because you
don't know how to compromise.

532
00:31:17,998 --> 00:31:20,669
Well, maybe that's my problem.
I don't want to compromise.

533
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:25,817
No disrespect, Curtis.

534
00:31:26,838 --> 00:31:28,385
I want my movie back.

535
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,930
And I want a star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame.

536
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,891
I know it sounds crazy.
I'll pay back my fee.

537
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,185
I'll tear up that contract,
and just act

538
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,687
- like none of this ever happened.
- You know, Simon was right about you.

539
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:42,441
- You are a nut.
- Maybe.

540
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:44,623
Or maybe I'd rather direct
Living in Reverse

541
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:47,321
with no budget, and all heart
than watch my life story

542
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,657
be destroyed by some
guy who doesn't even get it.

543
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,992
Look, I'm sorry to let you down.

544
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,744
But this is my movie, Jonah.

545
00:31:55,963 --> 00:31:57,337
I paid for it.

546
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,876
Thanks for everything.
The food was awesome.

547
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:05,211
Here you go.

548
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:09,218
A thousand bucks to sit on
the set of Living in Reverse.

549
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,691
The ladies love Owen Anderson.

550
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:13,973
Clearly,
I chose the wrong profession.

551
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:16,475
I gotta tell you.

552
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,194
You know I totally called it
on Jonah not being over you.

553
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,363
First the guy steamrolls
me into the swimming pool,

554
00:32:23,488 --> 00:32:25,537
and then he tries to
win a date with you.

555
00:32:25,662 --> 00:32:28,582
I think we're just gonna have to
agree to disagree on this one.

556
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,072
But don't think that I am
letting you off the hook

557
00:32:33,197 --> 00:32:35,348
for auctioning me on that date.

558
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:37,540
You are in so much trouble.

559
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,478
The way you say "trouble,"

560
00:32:39,603 --> 00:32:41,401
you make it sound like a good thing.

561
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:44,016
I'm taking you to the dungeon.

562
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:36,722
Here's Gabe's office.

563
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,475
Are you for real?

564
00:33:42,332 --> 00:33:45,411
When Caleb warned me that
Amanda would make me do things

565
00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:47,713
I couldn't imagine,
I didn't actually think he meant

566
00:33:47,838 --> 00:33:49,735
I'd stoop down to wearing digital.

567
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,817
Light.
Keep your eye on it.

568
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:53,614
We got ten minutes
to delete your name

569
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:55,778
off the overbilled files
before security comes by.

570
00:33:58,482 --> 00:34:00,893
All right, got it.

571
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:02,289
Let's go.

572
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,500
You're better at
this than I thought.

573
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,961
The only thing
we need now is the code.

574
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:12,414
I'm not even gonna
ask how you got this.

575
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:14,802
Let's just say my stock
soared in the geek community

576
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,888
today, no thanks to Jonah,
who wanted nothing to do with this.

577
00:34:18,335 --> 00:34:20,599
Like you didn't know what
you were getting into

578
00:34:20,804 --> 00:34:23,488
when you set your sights on a
guy with Jonah's moral center.

579
00:34:23,613 --> 00:34:25,278
It might have occurred to me.

580
00:34:25,403 --> 00:34:27,224
Only to be complicated by the fact

581
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:30,485
that I find his moral center one
of his most adorable attributes.

582
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:36,198
You realize that you just
said "adorable," right?

583
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,175
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Today at the fundraiser,

584
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,734
I actually felt this
twinge of jealousy.

585
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:45,143
Who would have thought that
Jonah Miller would be the one

586
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:47,473
to pierce the infamous
Ella Simms Kevlar?

587
00:34:53,223 --> 00:34:54,538
Um... Are you kidding me?

588
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:57,501
There's a partition in the mainframe
that even accountants can't access.

589
00:34:57,626 --> 00:34:59,555
Amanda's office.
Let's go!

590
00:35:08,782 --> 00:35:10,496
Okay, look for anything

591
00:35:10,621 --> 00:35:13,132
that Amanda could be using
to frame me with. Got it?

592
00:35:16,411 --> 00:35:17,841
Ella, come here.

593
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,289
She must have some file on me.

594
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,252
No way. 

595
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,130
"Sydney Andrews"?

596
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:40,666
You recognize that?

597
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,556
It's a Van de Kamp.
It's worth $19 mil.

598
00:35:42,786 --> 00:35:45,184
This went missing from a
Manhattan brownstone months ago.

599
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:49,146
Well, it certainly caught Amanda's eye.
You think she's looking for it?

600
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,445
It, or whatever painting
someone covered it with.

601
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,948
This explains why she's been
snooping around the courtyard

602
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,946
quizzing me about Syd's art.

603
00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:04,161
So this is why Amanda Woodward
slithered back to L.A.

604
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,672
Don't tell me you're here to
be treated for a kitchen burn.

605
00:36:21,969 --> 00:36:24,194
Bernadette Reese posted her review.

606
00:36:25,493 --> 00:36:27,309
- And?
- I don't know.

607
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,188
I was wondering if
you'd read it with me.

608
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:39,655
"In a nutshell, the 

609
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,699
new Coal is
an incredible experience.

610
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,452
"The food was memorable,
and the staff is charming.

611
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,113
New ownership has done
this place right."

612
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,750
- Not bad.
- Not bad?

613
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,467
David, this is a great!
She loved it.

614
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,293
I couldn't have done it without you.

615
00:36:58,717 --> 00:36:59,790
So thank you.

616
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:02,427
Look, I-I know there's still
a lot of hurt left to heal.

617
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:05,811
I just hope that
yesterday proved to you

618
00:37:05,936 --> 00:37:08,016
that you and I are
still a good team.

619
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,312
- Could I talk to you for a second?
- Kind of in the middle of something.

620
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,350
- It's important.
- I gotta get back to Coal, anyway.

621
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,192
I'll see you at home?

622
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,781
What, Drew?

623
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,122
Do you recognize this valve?

624
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:28,495
Of course I do. It's the one Dr.
Mancini invented.

625
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,456
I found one inside Kevin Hartson
when he died two days ago.

626
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,462
He came in complaining
of a headache.

627
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,973
He died in my arms

628
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:37,867
36 hours later fromassive
cerebral hemorrhage.

629
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:41,043
Which is why you were
taking his blood.

630
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,510
 I
couldn't tell you until I had it tested,

631
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,785
but I found traces of the
valve's antimicrobial materials.

632
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:50,679
You're trying to tell me that the valve
is leaching toxins into the bloodstream?

633
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,825
Four other patients who've
been treated with the M-valve...

634
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,065
including the one I took this from-
died in the last year

635
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,319
from strokes, all with
platelet malfunctions.

636
00:38:01,885 --> 00:38:04,361
Lauren, you are part of
Mancini's operating team.

637
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:06,571
You need to know this.

638
00:38:06,696 --> 00:38:08,785
You're treating people with
this thing all the time.

639
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,642
Look, I know

640
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:13,123
Mancini's like a god
in this hospital,

641
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:15,180
but how many patients have to die

642
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:17,127
before someone exposes thuth?

643
00:38:22,948 --> 00:38:24,416
Get your butt over here.

644
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:27,351
I made you a banana daiquiri.

645
00:38:28,811 --> 00:38:30,223
Twist my arm.

646
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:34,561
I guess this means you actually
finished all your work last night?

647
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:38,637
About last night, um,
you know how I said

648
00:38:38,762 --> 00:38:41,485
I had a date with my
computer and my Blackberry?

649
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,876
- That was a lie.
- What do you mean, a lie?

650
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:49,368
I actually didn't have any
work to do last night,

651
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:51,774
okay? In reality,

652
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,832
I enlisted David and we broke into WPK.
Flashlights, Lycra, the whole shebang.

653
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,984
Ella, I think you know
how I feel about this.

654
00:38:58,109 --> 00:38:59,958
- What if you had been caught?
- I wasn't.

655
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,041
Obviously, there's no way in hell

656
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:05,532
I can convince you to side with
me on this, but I just really...

657
00:39:05,657 --> 00:39:07,666
And yesterday,
when you were wearing that ultra-hot

658
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:10,342
"meeting with a client" outfit,
you weren't

659
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:12,891
- working then either?
- That was a pseudo-date

660
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,040
- with Gabe Taylor.
- Wait. Gabe Taylor?

661
00:39:15,165 --> 00:39:16,853
El, have you completely lost it?

662
00:39:17,863 --> 00:39:21,066
I kind of swiped his security
card after enduring a matinee

663
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,481
of Starkiller's Truce.

664
00:39:23,336 --> 00:39:25,851
So your heist wasn't
just premeditated;

665
00:39:25,976 --> 00:39:28,301
it actually required lunch
and a movie?

666
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:32,257
I didn't fess up because I
felt guilty about breaking in.

667
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,942
I'm telling you now because... 

668
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:39,376
because I don't want
to spin stories to you.

669
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,820
I don't want to lie to you.

670
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:51,138
I appreciate you
being honest with me.

671
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:53,212
You deserve to know the truth...

672
00:39:54,938 --> 00:39:56,037
always.

673
00:40:09,265 --> 00:40:11,475
I'm going to take a shower.

674
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,800
You have ten minutes to finish that
cocktail before you join me, you got it?

675
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:16,937
Oh, my gosh, I'm setting
my clock right now.

676
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:18,794
Hurry up. Don't take too long.

677
00:40:19,736 --> 00:40:21,063
I'll be waiting.

678
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,568
Hello?

679
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,812
- Jonah, Curtis Heller.
- Oh, hey, Curtis. What's up?

680
00:40:28,937 --> 00:40:32,041
So, Simon went through his
casting choices with Owen.

681
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:35,277
Owen hated his ideas,
and he kicked him off the project.

682
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,476
Are you kidding me?

683
00:40:38,162 --> 00:40:40,633
No. We were going over some alts,

684
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:44,217
- and he brought up your name.
- My name? As... as director?

685
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,324
We both took a look
at your short again.

686
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:48,233
You have a great eye.
You know the story.

687
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:49,696
What do you think?

688
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:54,806
I feel like I'm about to wake up

689
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:57,713
- from an unbelievable dream.
- You're not dreaming, kid.

690
00:40:57,838 --> 00:40:58,955
This is happening.

691
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,876
Why don't you get yourself an assistant?
We'll set you up on the lot. And Jonah?

692
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,329
- Don't let me down.
- Yeah. No, thank you.

693
00:41:08,853 --> 00:41:10,079
I'm a director.
