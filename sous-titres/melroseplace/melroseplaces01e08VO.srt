1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:02,084
<i>Précédemment...</i>

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,879
What's a rich boy like you
doing this stuff for anyway?

3
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,088
I need cash, OK?

4
00:00:06,577 --> 00:00:08,759
I'm Ella Simms.
Junior publicist.

5
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,192
All my life all I wanted
was to be a doctor.

6
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:13,679
- I'm concerned about your finances.
- I can work it out.

7
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,222
I didn't peg you as someone
who wanted to pursue

8
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,100
this line of work
on a regular basis.

9
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,645
I can't believe that girl
had to be the one to find her.

10
00:00:21,817 --> 00:00:24,481
- She's lived here 30 seconds?
- There's a hostess that just quit at Coal.

11
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:27,193
- I could put in a good word for you.
- You'd do that?

12
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,194
Who's this?

13
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:31,529
I'm the girl you kicked out of here
yesterday. Is the job still available?

14
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,239
We're getting married.

15
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:37,786
I'm only about to have a sit-down with a
guy whose films are over a billion dollars.

16
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:41,373
I'm Kendra, his development exec. I have a
lot of say in how we develop the scripts.

17
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:45,418
I just want you to tell me that you and Riley
have not crossed the line of friendship.

18
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:47,462
She kissed me,
not the other way around.

19
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:49,255
She kissed you?

20
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,292
So there's nothing going on
between you two?

21
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:54,178
You are the only guy
I want to be with.

22
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:57,097
- I was scared I missed you.
- What happened to your plans?

23
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:59,092
Just decided

24
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:02,150
it was an opportunity
I couldn't pass up.

25
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:04,859
You did not just say

26
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,304
The Killing was a better
film than Reservoir Dogs.

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,292
Reservoir Dogs is so
much more polished.

28
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:12,359
Dogs totally ripped off Kubrick.

29
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:14,425
Most of Tarantino's so-called
masterpieces

30
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,199
are overrated knockoffs.

31
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:18,243
Yes, he appropriates.

32
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:20,454
From like, everybody.
What makes him a genius

33
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:22,492
is how he puts those
pieces together.

34
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,166
I love how one of the most
original voices

35
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,993
I've heard recently is defending

36
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:29,004
one of the most unoriginal.

37
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:30,880
But enough about Tarantino.

38
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:34,134
I want to know more
about Jonah Miller.

39
00:01:34,317 --> 00:01:37,304
From the beginning.

40
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:42,492
The Jonah Miller story...

41
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:44,459
just starts out a little slow,

42
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:47,250
but then it has a few good twists.

43
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:52,659
* Did you hear me?
* Hello *

44
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:54,826
* Hello, hello,
don't disturb me * 86...

45
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,991
* I don't think you heard me,
so I gotta... *

46
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:00,025
And here she is again

47
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,995
returning home from yet
another late night

48
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,706
looking absolutely fabulous.

49
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:07,125
What are you doing here?
I thought you had a client dinner.

50
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,591
Client cancelled.

51
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,254
Anyway,

52
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:14,507
I need all the deets
on who you're getting dolled up for,

53
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,426
so spill.

54
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,125
Who's the lucky guy?

55
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,158
Believe me, there is no lucky guy.

56
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:22,893
Just a lot of unlucky first dates.

57
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,019
You are being strangely secretive.

58
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,092
Are you?

59
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,858
Or perhaps a married

60
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:33,318
doctor?

61
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:35,359
No married man.

62
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:37,192
Doctor or otherwise.

63
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:38,492
Drop it.

64
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,692
You know, Lor, gossip may be

65
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:43,125
my bread and butter at work,
but off duty,

66
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,164
I can actually keep a secret.

67
00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:51,211
I've been through the same thing
that you're dealing with,

68
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:53,225
at least once.

69
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,673
I appreciate that.

70
00:02:56,386 --> 00:03:00,183
But my life's just
not tabloid material.

71
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,425
And he is running faster than
I've ever seen the guy run,

72
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,626
and there's this totally
insane saliva-dripping Doberman

73
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:14,776
right on his heels.
I'm in the car, yelling,

74
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:17,530
"Travis, just drop
the chicken, man!"

75
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:20,824
Oh, my God.
Please tell me he made it.

76
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:21,783
Inches.

77
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:24,926
Doggie birthday parties,
never again.

78
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:28,540
That is where I draw the line.
That is hilarious.

79
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:30,526
And really sad.

80
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:32,459
Yeah. I guess it's that combination

81
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:34,672
that makes Living in Reverse
so heartfelt, too.

82
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:36,792
I have to say,

83
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,726
it is so refreshing

84
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,470
to meet a Hollywood executive
who gets my vision.

85
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:44,659
I just said
"gets my vision" out loud.

86
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:48,269
Like, without any irony.

87
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:49,812
On a scale

88
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:51,826
of one to total tool,
where do I fall?

89
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:55,776
Well, the scale I'm looking at
rates you in pretty high at funny,

90
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:57,562
honest...

91
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,113
charming...

92
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:02,616
... sexy.

93
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,392
Actually...

94
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:20,217
I'm engaged.

95
00:04:20,484 --> 00:04:21,844
You're engaged?

96
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:24,425
Why didn't you tell me?

97
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,764
I would've never...

98
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:27,325
I know. I-I should've.

99
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,292
I just... I got so wrapped up
in the moment.

100
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:31,659
The moment? We've been
here for an hour.

101
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:34,859
Look, Jonah, don't break
your poor fiancée's heart.

102
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:37,025
If you're not ready to take
the plunge, tell her now.

103
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,069
Oh, no, I'm ready
to take the plunge.

104
00:04:39,283 --> 00:04:40,617
Then why did you kiss me?

105
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,365
Check.

106
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,859
<i>Dark_Chii, Just-In, Luoleilina, P$iKo^^,
SirHill et WoLF971 présentent...</i>

107
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:05,692
Oh, my God, Auggie,

108
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,473
that smells amazing.

109
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:10,016
Why are you still here? We're closed.
You hungry?

110
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:11,259
I...

111
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,312
could definitely eat.
My dinner was cherries and olives.

112
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:16,147
That looks so beautiful.

113
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:19,325
Well, forget how it looks.

114
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,568
Close your eyes.

115
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:22,112
Come on, close your eyes.

116
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:24,092
You don't trust me?

117
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:26,250
You're the chef.

118
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:34,917
Too much going on?

119
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:40,491
- Maybe I should dial back some of the thyme.
- It was delicious. The flavors,

120
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:42,581
they're so layered.

121
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,301
Is that saffron?

122
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,552
Someone is developing a palate.

123
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,973
Mason, the owner, is coming tomorrow
to weigh in on the winter menu.

124
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:53,977
- If I could get a dish on it...
- Hostess, then bartender.

125
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,314
Don't tell me: you're
the next Julia Child?

126
00:05:57,584 --> 00:06:01,318
Marcello, you have to try this
dish Auggie invented.

127
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,985
- It's unreal.
- What is it?

128
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,448
Seared scallops
with oven-roasted tomato couscous

129
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,288
and a saffron beurre blanc.

130
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:11,225
Auggie, what were you thinking?

131
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,247
The saffron will bring out
the iodine taste

132
00:06:13,484 --> 00:06:14,492
of the scallops.

133
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:17,425
That's why I used caramelized shallots,
for sweetness,

134
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,628
and fresh thyme to punctuate.

135
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:33,118
I'd have used a little less thyme.

136
00:06:33,884 --> 00:06:35,518
Chef, I-I know

137
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:38,188
you're looking for dishes
for the new menu...

138
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,440
Your point?

139
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,359
I was wondering,
if I make the adjustment,

140
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,319
- maybe it could be a contender?
- Not quite ready for prime time.

141
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:46,905
But didn't spit it out for a change.

142
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,824
- I loved it.
- I'd order it.

143
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:52,417
Not at this restaurant you won't.

144
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,600
Want to get high?

145
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:17,788
I want to do whatever
you want to do.

146
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:22,392
You go first.

147
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,125
This where all the cool
kids come to hang out

148
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,410
and impress the ladies
with their skunk bud?

149
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:35,119
What skunk bud?
Come on, David.

150
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:37,688
Do you think I really give
a crap about the joint?

151
00:07:37,813 --> 00:07:39,183
I'm investigating a homicide.

152
00:07:45,517 --> 00:07:47,423
Look, we've been through this.

153
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,884
- I told you everything I know.
- I'm not so sure.

154
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:51,192
I didn't kill Sydney.

155
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:54,347
But your alibi's tied to someone
who was an accessory in her death.

156
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:57,259
The night of the murder,
Ella Simms hired a private investigator

157
00:07:57,384 --> 00:07:59,325
to break into Sydney Andrews'
apartment.

158
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,792
Theory is, things turned bad.

159
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:03,792
Now, you admit that you weren't
with Ella that night,

160
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:06,435
and we can arrest her
for obstruction of justice.

161
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:08,861
I don't know what
you're talking about.

162
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,692
But trust me, Ella didn't have
anything to do

163
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,726
with the murder.
Protecting your friends...

164
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:16,726
that's honorable.

165
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:19,158
It's also going to get you
in a lot of trouble.

166
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:21,165
Aiding and abetting kind of trouble.

167
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,418
If El killed Syd, do you really
think that I'd protect her?

168
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:26,726
I hate the person that did this.

169
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:30,007
Syd and I, we had a connection.
A real connection.

170
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:32,526
The kind where doors slam
and neighbors file noise complaints.

171
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:34,429
So, not every relationship's
picture-perfect.

172
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,183
She was there for me.

173
00:08:48,283 --> 00:08:49,819
I want to make you proud,

174
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:52,738
then I-I just...
I screwed up.

175
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,115
I can't help it, Mom.

176
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:56,492
I just... I miss you so much.

177
00:09:01,104 --> 00:09:01,884
Here.

178
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:06,670
I'm okay.

179
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:10,025
Your mom?

180
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:12,675
I had friends
whose parents had died,

181
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:15,119
and I felt bad,
but I never really got it

182
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:17,659
until... until I joined
that messed up club.

183
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:20,792
- Are your parents buried here?
- My father.

184
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,959
I don't think you ever get over it.

185
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:25,938
You just have to try

186
00:09:26,118 --> 00:09:28,775
to deal however you can.

187
00:09:29,598 --> 00:09:30,423
But...

188
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,154
the last thing you need
is advice from a stranger.

189
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,526
No, it's okay.

190
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:38,242
Everyone else says
that time makes things better.

191
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,870
You're the only one with
the guts to tell it like it is.

192
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:42,584
My name is Sydney.

193
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,833
David.

194
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,350
Do you want to get some breakfast?

195
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:17,907
Just tell me you and Ella were never
together the night of the murder.

196
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,893
That'd be a lie.

197
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:21,118
What else is a lie?

198
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:22,659
You live like a rock star

199
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:25,559
without a single deposit from
a trust fund or your old man.

200
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:28,125
You don't cooperate with me,
I'm gonna eventually find out

201
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,517
how you can afford
this life of leisure.

202
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,783
Where were you last night?

203
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,608
Didn't you get my text?

204
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:03,675
Said I'd be back late.

205
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:07,167
I did, and I tried waiting up.

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,709
Did you get my
message about Anton V?

207
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:13,176
I got it on my way home.

208
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:15,401
I replied.

209
00:11:20,532 --> 00:11:21,762
An emoticon?

210
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:25,101
It's hardly an
enthusiastic response.

211
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:33,675
Last night when you
left, you were upset

212
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,642
about Auggie.

213
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:39,700
I-I didn't want to go
to bed without talking.

214
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,276
Must have been some
walk you went on.

215
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:48,242
Where'd you go?

216
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:51,409
Just, you know, kind
of wandered over

217
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,409
to Sunset for a drink.

218
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:57,875
Next time, please wake me
up when you get home, okay?

219
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:04,642
You've got to be kidding me. What?

220
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,608
Travis just blew off

221
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:07,909
the wedding today.

222
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:09,853
He said he broke his wrist
playing Wii.

223
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,409
Is that even possible?
Yeah, anything's possible with Travis.

224
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:14,176
I don't believe this.

225
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,209
There's no way I'm going
to get this footage

226
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:18,742
they want today on my own.

227
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:20,209
I happen to know a girl

228
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:22,309
who used to assist her
boyfriend back in college.

229
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:24,709
From what I remember,
she was pretty good at it.

230
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:27,508
Thank you, Riles,
but I'll be... I'll be fine.

231
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:29,109
Senior year.

232
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:31,209
The chancellor's inauguration.

233
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,875
Was that not the funniest day ever?

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,475
Hilarious.

235
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,508
Practically every frame of B
camera was wobbling exactly in time

236
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,608
with your giggling. Come on, when is the
last time we spent a whole day together?

237
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,542
No, I'm on my way now.
Get him a private room.

238
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,908
A private floor, if possible.
Ella, Defcon five.

239
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:53,175
Let's move now.

240
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,808
I haven't seen you this stressed
since Allegra Abrams flashed

241
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:59,009
the entire press corps opening night
of Sundance. Jessie Roberts OD'd.

242
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,442
Apparently, he thought oxy
would help bring him down

243
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,192
from an all-night coke-fest. Please
tell me we're not headed to ID the body.

244
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,492
No, he's stable for now.
Just get a team together.

245
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:09,870
We can't have the public knowing
how many drugs are fueling

246
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,415
their favorite all-American smile.

247
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:13,325
Choppers are buzzing
ULA as we speak.

248
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,492
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

249
00:13:14,617 --> 00:13:15,659
Jessie's at ULA?

250
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:18,296
Let me handle this.

251
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:21,292
Ella, if we don't spin this exactly
right, we're gonna lose him as a client.

252
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:25,359
Caleb, my bestie, slash,
roommate works at ULA.

253
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:27,931
I'll have this thing buried
before the nurses bring Jessie

254
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:29,984
his Jell-O cup.

255
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:33,228
The owner's here.

256
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:36,359
He just valet'd his car.
Thanks for the heads-up.

257
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:39,909
It's great to see you.

258
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:42,988
Knew I was coming,
so I didn't eat breakfast.

259
00:13:43,217 --> 00:13:45,782
Mason, let's taste the winter menu.

260
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,659
Think a global

261
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:49,092
bazaar of flavors.

262
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:50,412
Lots of small plates.

263
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:52,914
Smaller plates mean smaller profits.

264
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,951
I want high-ticket entrees.

265
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,592
That's funny you should say that.

266
00:13:57,717 --> 00:14:00,526
One came to me last night
in a flash of inspiration.

267
00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:03,508
- Scallops.
- Got it. Sear them.

268
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:06,584
We'll pair them with
an oven-roasted tomato couscous.

269
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,392
How about a sauce, Chef?

270
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:10,932
Saffron beurre blanc.
Caramelize some shallots,

271
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,958
and throw in a some fresh thyme
to balance it out.

272
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,603
My mouth is watering.

273
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,272
By the time we're back from
choosing a bottle from the cellar,

274
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:19,566
it'll be ready, right, Auggie?

275
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:20,984
Yes, Chef.

276
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:23,058
Can't wait to taste it.

277
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:25,317
That one sounds like a real winner.

278
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:29,658
Did that just really happen?

279
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,703
That's like cooking plagiarism.

280
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:34,592
You can't let him get away with that.
I don't have a choice.

281
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:36,332
It's my job to make
Marcello look good.

282
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:37,709
There's a chain of command

283
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:39,626
in the kitchen, and if I ever want

284
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:41,379
to get promoted, I got to obey it.

285
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:45,450
From here, it looks like
your chain is being yanked.

286
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:54,225
Look at this place.

287
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,925
It's so beautiful.

288
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,025
The flowers are so amazing.

289
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,159
Amazing.

290
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:03,159
Can you believe that this is
going to be us soon?

291
00:15:03,284 --> 00:15:05,183
No, I really can't.

292
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:08,859
What is it?

293
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,025
You barely said a word in the car.

294
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,287
I was just, you know,
going over shots in my head.

295
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:17,415
These weddings are tricky.

296
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,659
We drove past three
comic book stores,

297
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:21,836
and you didn't even joke
about wanting to stop.

298
00:15:22,117 --> 00:15:23,588
I know when something's up.

299
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:26,617
We should probably set up
these tripods.

300
00:15:29,984 --> 00:15:31,225
Let's talk about it.

301
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,348
Otherwise, let's try
to make today fun, okay?

302
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:34,975
I mean, there's no reason

303
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:36,517
why it can't be.

304
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,793
You know, you're right.

305
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:43,108
Let's try to have fun.

306
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:44,985
Good.

307
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:46,759
You set up the mama tripod.

308
00:15:46,884 --> 00:15:48,362
I get the big daddy one.

309
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:49,759
Where do you want me?

310
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:51,918
Oh, my gosh, right here. Kidding.

311
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,246
Hi, champ.

312
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,124
Is this the part
where you yell at me?

313
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:01,668
Later. But first,

314
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:03,058
how are you?

315
00:16:03,183 --> 00:16:04,526
I'm fine.

316
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:06,526
I don't even know what happened.

317
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:09,676
- I swear, I just did, like, two lines.
- And ended up in the hospital?

318
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,095
Jessie, you're out of control.

319
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:13,492
It was nothing.

320
00:16:13,617 --> 00:16:15,058
It was just some bad blow.

321
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,724
You keep telling yourself that,

322
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,992
but I am not going to let your
legacy be a True Hollywood Story

323
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:23,148
- of "Oops, I Did It and Died."
- Does everyone know?

324
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:26,234
Does... does my mom know?

325
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:29,159
The rumors are starting to swirl.

326
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:31,117
Nothing that's not beyond repair.

327
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,783
Do you have any allergies?

328
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:35,292
I-I don't know.

329
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:36,411
Penicillin.

330
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:39,914
Perfect.

331
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:41,957
I am going to lock you in here.

332
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,003
No texting, no tweeting,
no phone calls, okay?

333
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,982
I'm gonna need my video games.

334
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:48,797
Fine.

335
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,549
But more importantly,

336
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:53,359
no more putting any
of that crap up your nose.

337
00:16:53,484 --> 00:16:56,139
Otherwise, you're going to have
to power lunch with River Phoenix.

338
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,992
Who's River Phoenix?

339
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:01,019
God, kill me now.

340
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:03,484
I got a page. W...

341
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:11,153
How is my favorite doctor?

342
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,782
- You paged me?
- I did. Come on, let's go chat.

343
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:20,459
Listen, Lauren,

344
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,248
I need a little favor.
Mm-hmm.

345
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:24,992
Jessie Roberts is one
of our biggest clients, okay?

346
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:28,559
He is Zac Efron
and the Jonas Brothers wrapped

347
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:30,692
into one squeaky clean,
heartthrobby package.

348
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:31,883
Squeaky clean?

349
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:35,092
That kid had so many
chemicals in his system,

350
00:17:35,217 --> 00:17:36,595
it's a miracle he woke up.

351
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:39,392
Which is exactly why
we are in crisis mode,

352
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,686
and exactly why you could
help us save the day again.

353
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,925
- What can I do?
- I just need you

354
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,793
to create new admissions documents

355
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:49,353
saying that Jessie had an
allergic reaction to penicillin.

356
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:55,218
Jessie does have the allergy, if anyone
checks, it'll be completely legit.

357
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:58,005
- It'll be completely unethical.
- And a felony.

358
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:02,692
I just need to buy a little time
until another scandal breaks out,

359
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:05,058
and then Jessie can move
forward with his life.

360
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,877
And I swear,

361
00:18:08,117 --> 00:18:11,131
I will personally escort him in to
Promises as soon as he gets out of here.

362
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,659
Come here.

363
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:15,958
Do you hear yourself
right now, Ella?

364
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,025
I am busting my ass at med school

365
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,426
so that one day I can take an oath

366
00:18:21,551 --> 00:18:22,891
that says, "First do no harm."

367
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:24,602
So, who's harmed?

368
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:27,426
The patient, the hospital,
the doctor, the truth.

369
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:28,606
You want more?

370
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:31,259
This could work in everyone's favor,

371
00:18:31,384 --> 00:18:32,986
including you.

372
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:34,958
What do you mean?

373
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,239
How?

374
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:39,526
WPK can make a donation
to the hospital.

375
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,826
Jessie could come by once a month,

376
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:44,289
visit the children's floors.

377
00:18:44,517 --> 00:18:48,126
What if I offered you
a financial incentive?

378
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,083
Say, a couple thousand dollars?

379
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,442
What did our friendly
neighborhood nurse have to say?

380
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:05,643
She won't budge.

381
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:07,075
And you tried everything?

382
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,342
Opened with altruism,

383
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:10,476
preyed upon her soft spot
for sick kids,

384
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:13,643
and then, trumped it all
with a generous financial plan.

385
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:16,779
Clearly, I don't know my
friend as well as I thought.

386
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:18,864
Well, how much did you throw at her?
A few grand.

387
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,743
If you're gonna try and buy somebody
off, you don't do it with chump change.

388
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:24,442
We're gonna charge this
to Jessie's account.

389
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:27,413
Go back, do a little multiplication.
Fifty.

390
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,166
Thousand?

391
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:31,908
That is a week of walking around
money for Jessie.

392
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:34,631
We don't have time
for negotiation games.

393
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:38,409
I'm not sure that there's
a deal to be made.

394
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,109
There is always a deal to be made.

395
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:41,387
Get it done.

396
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:45,557
We need to talk.

397
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,808
David, whatever it is, I don't
have time for it, all right?

398
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:51,309
I'm in the middle
of a major spin cycle

399
00:19:51,434 --> 00:19:52,524
for a major client.

400
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:55,901
Detective Rodriguez cornered me
in the courtyard last night.

401
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:59,113
I always thought
he had a crush on you.

402
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:02,407
He thinks that you had
something to do with the murder.

403
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,309
And he wants me to admit
that our alibi's a sham,

404
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:06,537
and if I don't, he's gonna find
a reason to throw me in jail.

405
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:08,042
He can't do that.

406
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,374
I mean, he doesn't have proof
that we weren't together.

407
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,918
He did tell me a funny story
about you meeting with a P.I.

408
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,921
the night that Sydney was murdered,

409
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:18,173
hiring him to break into her place.

410
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,635
You weren't with a married client

411
00:20:20,868 --> 00:20:22,967
that night, were you?

412
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,724
Why did you lie to me, El?

413
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,576
I know you didn't kill her.

414
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:32,188
Yeah, I didn't kill her,

415
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:33,940
but that P.I. I hired--

416
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,709
he was a hothead, David.

417
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:39,195
If Syd found him
in her apartment, he easily

418
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,946
could have killed her,
and if he did, well,

419
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:43,200
that would make yours truly
an accessory to murder.

420
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:48,037
He didn't kill her, Ella.

421
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:50,540
How do you know?

422
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:53,033
I just know.

423
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,462
Last time I checked,
you're not a psychic.

424
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,868
So, why don't you tell me
what's going on, David?

425
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:02,276
I blacked out that night.

426
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:04,842
You know how I get
when I'm that drunk.

427
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,842
Landing in bed with
some double-bagger...

428
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,350
After you told me that Syd

429
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,667
was sleeping with my dad...

430
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,401
I was so mad at her, El.

431
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:19,775
I know, I know.

432
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,738
You hate the pretentious idiots
who go to art openings,

433
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,491
but... I'm dragging you to this one.

434
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:27,285
And when we come back,

435
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:29,900
I will make it worth your while.

436
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,334
Why, Syd?
David, let go of my arm.

437
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,495
Why did you have to use me?
What are you talking about?

438
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,631
You were sleeping with my father!

439
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:42,701
He calls it off, so you
come after me to make him jealous?

440
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:46,701
I loved you.

441
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:50,016
At the cemetery,
you knew exactly who I was.

442
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:53,011
And your father... I bet
he's alive and well, isn't he?

443
00:21:53,635 --> 00:21:56,021
You'll say and do
anything to get what you want.

444
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,000
You're nothing but a pathetic whore.

445
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:03,100
And you are a spoiled brat.

446
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:08,701
David. Do you really think

447
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:11,567
that you could have done it?
Honestly, El?

448
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:13,830
I don't know.

449
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:20,837
50 bucks says the band inside plays
"Celebration" within the first 3 songs.

450
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,965
All right. I'll take that bet.
Double or nothing.

451
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:25,342
The other two songs will be

452
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:27,470
"Hot Hot Hot"
and "Unchained Melody."

453
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:29,472
All right. You're on.

454
00:22:29,701 --> 00:22:32,042
I guess we should start thinking
about bands for our wedding.

455
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:33,100
Bands?

456
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,268
Bands are way too unpredictable,

457
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:37,676
and then they take breaks,
and you have to feed them.

458
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:39,983
DJ all the way.

459
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,409
What are you talking about?
Bands are so much more fun to dance to.

460
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:46,239
Maybe after the
45-minute sound check.

461
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:47,643
Would you...

462
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:49,951
maybe consider having a band
because it's what I want?

463
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:53,412
Now you want me to start considering
the other person's feelings?

464
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:55,775
Dangerous precedent.
What is that supposed to mean?

465
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,775
You don't think
I consider your feelings?

466
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,242
- Videographers.
- Get ready.

467
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:02,588
And be sure you get close-ups
of the vows.

468
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:03,975
They'll always want to remember

469
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,933
how in love they were
on their wedding day.

470
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,109
Hey, Lauren.

471
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:19,000
Yo, woman.

472
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:29,775
You would make, like,
the best porn doctor ever.

473
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:35,455
Fancy.

474
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,701
I like it.

475
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,334
Oh, my God.

476
00:23:55,162 --> 00:23:56,830
My God.

477
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:59,300
What are you doing?

478
00:24:01,134 --> 00:24:04,401
I was just going to ask you
the same thing, pretty woman.

479
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,075
The late nights.

480
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,567
The amazing wardrobe.

481
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,275
The mystery men.

482
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
How did I not
figure this out sooner?

483
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:19,909
Figure what out?

484
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:22,334
My dad sent me that money
for school.

485
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,567
Who's your dad, Tony Soprano?

486
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,442
This is a brick of cold cash.

487
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,742
He won it playing poker.
He's been playing

488
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,034
every Wednesday night,
ever since I was a kid.

489
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,167
Lor, it's the middle
of the afternoon,

490
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,450
and you're dressed
like a million bucks.

491
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:38,399
Which better be in the ballpark
of what you're charging.

492
00:24:39,701 --> 00:24:41,909
I was at a luncheon, okay?

493
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:43,909
An interns special honors lunch.

494
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:46,975
And I resent you interrogating me
like I'm some kind of...

495
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,372
Prostitute?

496
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:57,285
You're right. I'm sorry.

497
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:01,434
Having said that,
if you help my client,

498
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,075
maybe I can relieve you

499
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
from some of your intern luncheons.

500
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:09,034
You're not seriously still trying to get
me to change Jessie's hospital records?

501
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:11,642
I'm confused.

502
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:14,676
You refuse to screw the system
just a little bit,

503
00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:16,801
but you have no problem at all
screwing...

504
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:19,434
Seriously, stop.

505
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,734
We're offering you

506
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,500
$50,000.

507
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:28,334
No more having
to get money from Daddy.

508
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,569
You can pay for school yourself.

509
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,801
My career comes first.

510
00:25:38,726 --> 00:25:40,954
Thought you of all people
would understand that.

511
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:52,705
I vow to always be honest with you.

512
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:57,338
To never keep a secret from you.

513
00:25:57,834 --> 00:26:01,667
'Cause sharing my life means
sharing everything with you,

514
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,068
the good and the bad.

515
00:26:06,634 --> 00:26:09,676
And knowing that whatever
we come up against,

516
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:14,167
and no matter what we go through,
how tough things get,

517
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,233
we'll handle it... together.

518
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:22,042
That was so sweet.

519
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,701
I was actually tearing up
during the vows.

520
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,200
Yeah, I saw that.

521
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,217
I kissed someone last night.

522
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:38,262
What?

523
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,001
Her name's Kendra.
She works for Andrew Misher.

524
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,975
Oh, God.

525
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:46,267
I had the same exact reaction
when I found out you kissed Auggie.

526
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:51,042
But the difference between
us is, you carried on

527
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:55,042
like nothing ever happened,
and I feel like absolute crap.

528
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:56,909
I can explain the Auggie thing.

529
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:59,075
Now you want to explain it.

530
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,676
That blows my mind, since you've
been going out of your way

531
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:04,042
to keep it from me for...
how many weeks?

532
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:08,000
You have no idea how much I wanted to
come out and tell you. But you didn't!

533
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,142
And, meanwhile, I had to tell you,

534
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:13,776
because it's just been
eating at me all day.

535
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:16,001
The Auggie thing...

536
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,776
it was meaningless.

537
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:19,142
It was a stupid mistake.

538
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:21,834
It wasn't worth telling you,
and then fighting about,

539
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,975
and then...
Finding out how awful it feels

540
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,801
to rip someone's heart out?

541
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,334
If I could take it back,
Jonah, I would.

542
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,801
I'm so sorry.

543
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,075
I don't know what else to say.

544
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,576
There's nothing else to say.

545
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:40,267
I've got a reception to shoot.

546
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:48,909
Where is it?

547
00:28:49,034 --> 00:28:50,968
It was right here.

548
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:54,342
Oh, no, it's gone.

549
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:01,192
Someone killed
this porterhouse twice.

550
00:29:01,317 --> 00:29:03,490
I said medium rare.

551
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,225
I'm on it.

552
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,451
Everything okay?

553
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,359
You... you seem
a little stressed out.

554
00:29:08,484 --> 00:29:09,538
Yeah, I'm fine.

555
00:29:11,562 --> 00:29:12,993
What are you doing here?

556
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:16,093
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a minute.

557
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:18,059
Do you mind, Violet?

558
00:29:18,184 --> 00:29:20,084
No, not at all.

559
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,192
What's going on?

560
00:29:27,317 --> 00:29:29,158
Why did you tell Jonah we kissed?

561
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:31,810
Riley, I'm so sorry about that.

562
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,959
The way he was talking,
it sounded like you already told him.

563
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:37,023
I completely screwed up.

564
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,325
Yeah, so did I.

565
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,735
By getting drunk that night.

566
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:43,613
Obviously, if I were sober,
that would have never happened, ever.

567
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,026
It was a one time thing.

568
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:47,325
We just... we got caught up
in the moment.

569
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:49,325
There was no moment, Auggie.

570
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,871
That's what I'm trying to say.

571
00:29:54,017 --> 00:29:55,959
It will never happen again.

572
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,917
I know.

573
00:29:58,101 --> 00:29:59,842
Because...

574
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:02,167
I don't think we should
hang out anymore.

575
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,343
It's ruining my relationship.

576
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,575
What, so no coffee, no jogging,

577
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,264
no doing what friends do?

578
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:10,558
I'm getting married...
to Jonah.

579
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:12,435
I love him, and it bothers him

580
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,728
when we hang out.

581
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:18,101
I'm sorry.
It's the way it has to be.

582
00:30:21,201 --> 00:30:23,201
You know I care about you, Auggie.

583
00:30:24,634 --> 00:30:26,586
Please tell me you understand.

584
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:30,077
It makes complete sense.

585
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:33,967
I totally get it.

586
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,094
Finally.
Let me see the documents.

587
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,308
I got the Smoking Gun on standby.

588
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:50,967
Plan "B."

589
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:53,559
You ready? It's good.

590
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:56,609
What the hell are you talking about?
What happened to plan "A"?

591
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:58,146
Where are the medical records?

592
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:00,815
Turns out my friend's a lot
more stubborn than I thought.

593
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,360
I am as shocked as you are.

594
00:31:03,634 --> 00:31:06,809
You said you live with this rse.
Dig up everything you can find.

595
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:09,200
Malpractice suits,
test scores, what...

596
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,800
I have a better idea.

597
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:16,742
We let the story out...

598
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:18,575
exactly how it is.

599
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,243
The truth.

600
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:21,375
I'm sorry.

601
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,609
Did you get your hands
on Jessie's stash

602
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:26,467
and ingest all of it?
Look, paying off hospitals,

603
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:29,719
pretending like none of this ever
happened... we'd only be enabling him.

604
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:32,442
Is this a plan "B"
or an intervention?

605
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:33,516
Both.

606
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,642
Look, this kid's life has
to come before his career,

607
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,909
and if we bury it,
it's only a matter of time

608
00:31:39,034 --> 00:31:42,066
before he ends up back in this
hospital getting his stomach pumped.

609
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,401
Plus, you and I both know
that there is a solid chance

610
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,704
that some tabloid has
a hospital worker on payroll.

611
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,702
At least this way
we control the story.

612
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,828
Exactly.

613
00:31:55,134 --> 00:31:57,375
And if Jessie is spoon-fed
a healthy dose

614
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,292
of public humiliation
and goes through rehab,

615
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,609
not only will he be healthy,

616
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:05,381
but the baby-faced tweenybopper
turns into a leading man.

617
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:09,009
It's risky... but inspired.

618
00:32:09,268 --> 00:32:11,804
I'm gonna go make some phone calls.

619
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:15,742
Oh, and Caleb, for the
record, my friend...

620
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,842
she's not a nurse. She's going
to be one of the finest doctors

621
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:22,201
this hospital has ever had on staff.

622
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:34,326
Deglaze, don't torch the place.

623
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,500
It's under control, Chef.

624
00:32:40,368 --> 00:32:42,375
I don't taste the thyme.

625
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,045
Great, I'll just put it back
to the way I originally had it.

626
00:32:45,368 --> 00:32:47,381
I don't need attitude.

627
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,175
And from now on, when you're on shift,
no ducking out to whisper sweet nothings

628
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,678
to your exotic girlfriend.

629
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:54,388
She's just a friend.

630
00:32:54,734 --> 00:32:56,223
Come on.

631
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,101
I saw the way you two were staring
into each other's eyes,

632
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,769
which was fine because...
I couldn't stop staring at her ass.

633
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:05,742
Don't talk about her like
she's a piece of meat.

634
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:07,909
She's not a piece of meat.

635
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:10,696
She's sweet like dessert.

636
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,767
You up for sharing?

637
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,250
Just stay back, stay back.

638
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,575
Oh, my God, Auggie! Stop!

639
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:32,008
Get off of me! Get off of me!

640
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,234
Calm down, calm down.

641
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:47,409
Look, I'm not exactly the
best company right now.

642
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:49,643
You left your knives
at the restaurant.

643
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:51,820
I knew you'd want them.

644
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:55,295
Thanks.

645
00:34:01,234 --> 00:34:04,743
Who needs Coal?
You are way too good for that place.

646
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:07,709
And Marcello... he had it coming.

647
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:09,667
That guy is a total dick.

648
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:17,142
I just lost control
like I was out of my body.

649
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:18,401
I couldn't stop.

650
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,242
You don't need to hear this.

651
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,938
I'm your friend.
You can tell me anything.

652
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,314
Whatever you need.

653
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:35,434
Does it hurt?

654
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,542
I'm sorry.

655
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:55,709
I shouldn't have.

656
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:58,401
Yes, you should.

657
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,676
Look what was just turned in.

658
00:35:25,801 --> 00:35:27,342
Construction worker

659
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:29,142
found it at a site in Van Nuys.

660
00:35:29,267 --> 00:35:31,376
Blade size is consistent
with Sydney Andrews' wounds.

661
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:32,609
Get it to the lab.

662
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:34,067
Put a rush on it.

663
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:03,509
I'm so sorry, Syd.

664
00:36:03,634 --> 00:36:05,868
I'm so sorry.

665
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,475
Yeah, tomorrow's great.

666
00:36:12,626 --> 00:36:14,709
I look forward to it, okay.

667
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:17,775
I'll be there.

668
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:27,473
So I was just at Coal.

669
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:33,554
Telling Auggie that we can't
hang out with each other anymore.

670
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:38,269
I didn't tell you to do that.

671
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:40,609
I wouldn't tell you to do that.

672
00:36:41,276 --> 00:36:42,825
I know; I wanted to.

673
00:36:45,277 --> 00:36:46,703
We come first.

674
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,175
Was that another job?

675
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,632
It was...
Kendra, actually.

676
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,609
You're seeing her tomorrow?

677
00:37:01,734 --> 00:37:04,775
To work on my pitch.

678
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,307
You know, for Andrew Misher.

679
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:11,309
I just told one of my closest friends that
I'm going to have nothing to do with him.

680
00:37:11,434 --> 00:37:13,897
I didn't ask you to do that.
I wanted

681
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:16,209
to show you how much
you matter to me,

682
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:19,009
and you are in here making plans

683
00:37:19,134 --> 00:37:20,409
with some girl you kissed.

684
00:37:20,534 --> 00:37:22,309
This is my career.

685
00:37:22,434 --> 00:37:25,542
I'm not going to stop working
with a development executive

686
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,442
just because you and I
are having trouble.

687
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:30,942
You're obviously not going to
feel guilty about it either.

688
00:37:31,067 --> 00:37:34,042
This is the only producer

689
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:35,342
who cares about my film

690
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:36,609
in this town.

691
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:40,142
I can't afford
to just walk away from that.

692
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:44,669
My relationship with Kendra... from now
on, it's... it's strictly professional.

693
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,643
Now, if you just want to maybe...

694
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:50,642
I don't know... trust me, fine,

695
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,700
but if not, I don't...

696
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,857
I don't know what to say.

697
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,094
What is happening to us?

698
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:00,476
I feel like we are
on two trains heading

699
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:03,071
in two completely
opposite directions.

700
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:06,810
And it's bigger than
Auggie or Kendra.

701
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,822
I feel like...

702
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:12,788
ever since I asked you to marry me,

703
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:16,760
things have just been...

704
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:18,916
off.

705
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,401
We have our issues; everyone does.

706
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,601
Relationships aren't always
easy, but come on, it's us.

707
00:38:32,967 --> 00:38:35,242
Jonah, I am willing to
do something about it.

708
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:37,042
Are you?

709
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:39,009
I want to save us.

710
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,736
I hate fighting with you.
Fighting with you sucks.

711
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:47,042
Whatever this... this place
that we're in right now,

712
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:48,250
it sucks.

713
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:51,351
If I could just...

714
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,627
if I could erase

715
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:57,584
everything that's happened over
the last couple days, I would.

716
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,175
I can't.

717
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:10,389
So where do we go from here?

718
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:49,209
Lor, it's rare I say
these words, but...

719
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:52,142
I'm sorry.

720
00:39:53,962 --> 00:39:55,209
Walking into ULA,

721
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:57,175
trying to buy your signature,

722
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,975
I don't know what I was thinking,

723
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,975
but I'm sorry
for even thinking it and...

724
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,153
I-I'm even more sorry for assuming
that you might go along with it.

725
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:10,908
I promise I will never ask you

726
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,993
to compromise
your doctor's ethics again.

727
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:18,542
Unless it involves
a future prescription pad.

728
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,042
I saw Jessie's story break
on the news.

729
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:24,827
Yeah, genius, right?

730
00:40:24,952 --> 00:40:27,476
A few Psas, he'll be
the next Robert Downey Jr.

731
00:40:29,267 --> 00:40:32,309
But... you were right.

732
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:35,209
The best thing for him
was to come clean.

733
00:40:35,334 --> 00:40:38,142
So I hope you're not sharing

734
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:41,042
your ridiculous theories
about me with the whole world.

735
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:44,609
No, I didn't say a word
about my ridiculous theories,

736
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,676
and I won't bring them up again...

737
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:49,167
to anyone, including you.

738
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,904
But if you're ready
to talk about it, I'm here,

739
00:40:55,501 --> 00:40:57,743
and if you're never ready
to talk about it,

740
00:40:57,868 --> 00:41:00,609
I will still be here.

741
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:08,643
There's nothing to talk about.

742
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,344
Understood.

743
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:14,576
Now, can we go watch

744
00:41:14,701 --> 00:41:17,109
some movies?

745
00:41:17,234 --> 00:41:19,559
How about a Julia Roberts marathon?

746
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:23,409
Okay, you make one more Pretty
Woman joke, I will kill you.

747
00:41:23,534 --> 00:41:25,743
Hey, I was going to say
Steel Magnolias.

748
00:41:27,634 --> 00:41:30,868
Closest I come to that crying
thing you people sometimes do.
