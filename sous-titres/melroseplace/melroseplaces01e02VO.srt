1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,900
Previously on Melrose Place:

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,100
She needs a better publicist.
She needs me.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,700
Jonah! You are
a hugely talented filmmaker.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,100
You're also...
the most charming human being I know.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,900
You going to come downtown and help teach
the Pledge of Allegiance to my first-graders?

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,600
Will you marry me?

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,300
I can't believe that girl
had to be the one to find her.

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,400
Poor thing-- she's lived here...
30 seconds?

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,400
- Did you know her pretty well?
- I met her four years ago.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,500
She's the one who convinced me
I could be a real chef.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,700
Daddy's got money, huh?

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,800
Get in the car!

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,000
??
Patek watch, the Prada.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,400
 You're getting
your money somewhere.

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,500
All my life, all I wanted
was to be a doctor.

16
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,400
Now the university is telling me that I have
to pay in full by the end of the semester

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,600
or they're going to kick me out.

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,700
I went on this fancy dinner
with this guy, Toby.

19
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,900
He offered me $5,000
to have sex with him.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,800
Oh, my God. Sydney.

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
You, uh...

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,400
- on a walk of shame?
- Jeez, David, you scared me.

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,600
Nice step up from the scrubs.

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,900
I'm guessing you're not
coming home from work.

25
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,600
I'm guessing you're not, either.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,100
Perk of the trust fund, huh?

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,200
Sleep all day,
party all night?

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,600
Something like that.

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,000
Jonah.

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,400
Jonah, wake up.

31
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,300
Am I still dreaming,
or did you make breakfast?

32
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,600
"Made" is strong.
I poured.

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,300
All green clovers?

34
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,300
That's like... miraculous.

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,200
I had to sift
through three boxes,

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,100
but after leaving you hanging
all day before I said yes,

37
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,200
I figured you deserved
breakfast in bed.

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,400
Plus... a day off to celebrate
engagementhood with your future wife.

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,000
What about school?

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,500
Your first-graders are going to be, like,
climbing the walls without you there.

41
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,100
That's what substitutes are for.

42
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,200
- Unless you have other plans.
- No, no, no, no, this is amazing.

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,000
What are you thinking,
like, a Runyon hike or...?

44
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,900
You want to maybe scout some
potential wedding locations?

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,000
I think I have a better idea.

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,600
Seriously?

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,300
Hi.

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,800
What are you still doing here?

49
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,500
Uh, I live here.

50
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,600
Ella, what's going on?

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,000
God, Jonah and Rilus
interruptus?

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,200
Do you need something?

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,900
Yes, as a matter
of fact, I do.

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,700
Yesterday, I took a building-wide poll
after the, um... murder... 

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,400
and we all agreed we would feel a lot safer in the
courtyard if there was some sort of security camera.

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,000
So, with Jonah being the building's
resident film school grad/A.V. geek,

57
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,800
- we figured you could hook us up.
- Yeah.

58
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,900
Yeah, I mean, I guess,
sure. I have a...

59
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,700
- a camera I used for Skype.
- Oh, fantastic.

60
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,900
Shouldn't a security company
be taking care of that?

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,800
The management company said a service call
is more than three weeks away.

62
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,900
Jonah could hang
something up right now,

63
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,500
and we'll just put up a sign saying
the building's under surveillance.

64
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,200
Uh, we actually
have plans.

65
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,200
- We're, uh, going to the beach.
- Oh.

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,500
- We are?
- How sweet.

67
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, he's only
hanging up a camera.

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,800
- I mean, how long could it take?
- Exactly.

69
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,400
Can't it wait until we get back?

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,500
Riley, if...

71
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,100
if everyone's going to feel safe
with the camera, I'll just do it now.

72
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,500
- It'll take a second.
- Wonderful.

73
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,900
I'll see you
later.

74
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,300
What?

75
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
It's fine.
It'll just take a second.

76
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Sorry.

77
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,600
I borrowed your classifieds.

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,900
- If you need them...
- Oh, no.

79
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,400
I was just looking for the sports.

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
What, are you
job-hunting?

81
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,800
Yeah.
There's this ad for models:

82
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,900
no experience necessary,
$300 a day.

83
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,000
Definitely an interview
you want to skip.

84
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,200
You know, there's a, uh... a
hostess that just quit at Coal.

85
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,400
If you want, I could put in
a good word for you.

86
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,000
Really?

87
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
- You would do that?
- Why don't you come down tonight. I'm working.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
Ask for Marcello.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,200
Thanks.

90
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,500
Mr. Kirkpatrick.

91
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,700
Detective Rodriguez.
We spoke yesterday.

92
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Oh, right. How you doing?

93
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,000
Just wanted to ask you
a few more questions.

94
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,400
You know, we're talking to all
the tenants in the building.

95
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,800
Totally routine.

96
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,300
Yeah, sure.
Whatever I can do.

97
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,500
How well did you know
Sydney Andrews?

98
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,300
Blackmail...

99
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,100
is such an ugly word.
I prefer... "persuaded."

100
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,600
After I persuaded
my first husband to marry me,

101
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,400
I started drinking.

102
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,600
Probably to deal with the fact
that he didn't really love me.

103
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,000
Thanks.

104
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
First time?

105
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,700
You know, I don't think it counts with
the courts if you don't actually come in.

106
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
How did you know?

107
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,700
No one would choose to get sober
on Saint Patrick's Day unless they had to.

108
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,900
Hey.

109
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,400
You're not wearing green.

110
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,800
Yeah, well, I wasn't
really feeling it this year.

111
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,400
So we miss drinking
at Molly Malone's tonight.

112
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,100
Who cares?

113
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,800
There are a lot of other things
we could do to have fun.

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,000
Sydney and... and I-- we were...
we were just friends.

118
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,100
Ella, this isn't a merger.
It's a bloodbath.

119
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,500
Only for those being let go.

120
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,800
That senior VP from the
new firm, Caleb Brewer--

121
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,100
he just got here from New York.

122
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,100
He's been here barely an hour,
and half of our floor is gone.

123
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,700
- Even Phillip.
- Oh, thank God.

124
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,200
I was getting tired of his
snack room melodrama anyway.

125
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,900
So, where is this Caleb,
sharpening his hatchet?

126
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,600
Ella, wait,
you can't go up there.

127
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
Watch and learn.

128
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,500
Hi. I'm Ella.

129
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
Simms?

130
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,700
- Junior publicist?
- Right.

131
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,300
- You work under Phillip.
- Worked.

132
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,200
From what I hear, he's past tense,
and quite frankly, good call.

133
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,000
Never trust a man
who spray-tans.

134
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,100
Or a woman who has no loyalty
for her coworker.

135
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,400
Here you go.
Pack up your office.

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What?

137
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,000
You know...

138
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,600
think of this as
the Titanic, Ella.

139
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,200
There's only so much room
on the life raft.

140
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,500
Caleb...

141
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,400
I never say this to a man,
but I am now.

142
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,300
Letting me go would be
the biggest mistake of your life.

143
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,200
Oh, I seriously doubt that.

144
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,100
Give me the weekend,
and I promise,

145
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,400
I will bring a client into this firm
that is bigger than Zach Quinto's eyebrows.

146
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,800
- Does that even exist?
- Two words.

147
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,800
Jasper Barnes.

148
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,300
So...

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,900
you think that you're going to sign
the hottest star of the summer?

150
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,900
Oh, no, no, no.

151
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,900
I don't think.
I know.

152
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,200
BDG is dropping the ball,
and he's vulnerable.

153
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,400
And of course, I am all over it.

154
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,700
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you the weekend,

155
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,000
but you come back Monday morning
empty-handed, and you're out.

156
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,200
That's one thing you'll learn
about me, Caleb.

157
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,400
I never come back empty-handed.

158
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,400
Come on.
Zuma Beach is calling our name.

159
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,700
Oh, I hear Zuma, too,
and I'm saying back,

160
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,100
"We're going to be there soon."

161
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,600
You realize this camera
is also a total invasion of privacy.

162
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Not if the building
asked for it.

163
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,800
Ella asked for it.

164
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,300
Okay, is that what's
bothering you here-- Ella?

165
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,700
Kind of.

166
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,200
I mean, she walks into our
apartment like she owns it.

167
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,900
What?

168
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,300
And then you drop everything
just because she asks you to.

169
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,500
Dropping?

170
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,300
Nobody's dropping anything.
I didn't drop anything.

171
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,700
I just... I want everyone
to feel safe.

172
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,500
Come on, Jonah.
This camera isn't about people feeling safe.

173
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,000
It's just another excuse
for her to come between us.

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,100
Riles,

175
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,200
Ella's not the Wicked Witch
of West Hollywood.

176
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,300
She's just looking out
for everyone's safety.

177
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Look, give me
five minutes.

178
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,100
I'm going to pack up that rocket sled,
and then it's "PCH, here we come."

179
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,400
Well, I'm totally going to
kick your butt in smash-ball.

180
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,600
Okay, fine, you're on.

181
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,500
Look, I know the market's pretty soft
for a pre-Impressionist Plein Air,

182
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,800
but Sotheby's has that
listed at 1.3.

183
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Million.

184
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,500
I don't know.
I'll see what I can do.

185
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,800
I can't give you anything
for it until I have a buyer.

186
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't work on consignment.

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Since when are you interested
in French landscapes?

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,700
Since my dad started
collecting them.

1
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,300
I don't get it, man.

2
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,500
What's a rich boy like you
doing this stuff for anyway?

3
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,800
Look, I need
cash, okay?

4
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,400
- Can you sell it or not?
- I'll talk to my guys.

5
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,300
But you want quick cash...

6
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,400
bring me something I can move.

7
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,800
How about a Tour de I'lle watch?

8
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Gold casing,
diamond-crested dial.

9
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Diamonds are Amir's best friend.

10
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,600
But come on, the Tour de I'lle?
I know that watch.

11
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,200
- It's one of a kind.
- Yeah, so am I.

12
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,500
It's at a house on Nightingale.
There's a party there tomorrow night.

13
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,200
Stop by for a drink, some food,

14
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,700
pick up a nice little timepiece
as a party favor.

15
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,400
I'll see you back here
tomorrow night around closing.

16
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,300
What's up?

17
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,400
Hi. So, that party
tomorrow night?

18
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,800
I'm your plus one, okay?

19
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,900
Sorry, El. I told you already.
It's a plus none. Trudy's keeping it small.

20
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,200
I know what you told me,
and I'm ignoring it.

21
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,300
Jasper Barnes is going to be there,
and I need a face-to-face.

22
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't care. You can't come.

23
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,500
Give me one good reason.

24
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,400
Uh, Trudy.
She's my ex.

25
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,300
From high school. Who cares?

26
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,400
She does.

27
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,100
Oh, David, please, okay?

28
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,500
She's a stylist to the stars.
She can date anyone she wants.

29
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,800
El, listen, El.

30
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,300
Okay, I'm telling you.
She's still hung up on me.

31
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,200
Showing up with you is gonna
unleash her inner crazy.

32
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
Yeah, and I promise you
I won't dry-hump you in the doorway.

33
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,200
Seriously, tell her
we're just friends.

34
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,300
Although, I guess that conflicts with what I told
that detective the night I was saving your ass.

35
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,100
How many times are you going
to remind me of that?

36
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,500
Call Trudy and score me
an invite to that party,

37
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,200
or your alibi for the night
Sydney died goes bye-bye.

38
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,700
Another shot of the good stuff,
you'll be feeling a lot better.

39
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,700
Hello?

40
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,600
Lauren, hey. It's Toby...
from last night.

41
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,900
Hey, Toby.
You-You still in Los Angeles?

42
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,800
I'm on my way to the airport.

43
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,200
Look, I-I just wanted to call and tell you
that I had a great time last night.

44
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,600
I know it could have
been awkward.

45
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,300
Toby, you paid me to have sex
with you. Awkward was a given.

46
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,600
You're a nice girl, Lauren.

47
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,800
And you are going
to be a phenomenal doctor.

48
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,900
Already are.
Listen, I, uh...

49
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,200
I just had breakfast
with this friend of mine, Rick.

50
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,100
- I think he could help you out.
- Help me out?

51
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,000
I mean, make a donation, you know,
kind of like I did.

52
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,500
Look, Toby...

53
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,400
what happened last night--
that was a one-time thing.

54
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,800
- Okay?
- Rick is a really cool guy.

55
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,000
I wouldn't have called if
I didn't think you'd like him.

56
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,500
You know, Toby, thank you for
being my pimp, but I'll pass.

57
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,000
All right. Well, if you change
your mind, you have my number.

58
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,900
- Hey.
- Hey.

59
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,100
How was it out there?

60
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,300
Oh, decent sets.

61
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,400
Look, I'm-I'm sorry. I know we'd
talked about going for a run this morning.

62
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,300
I didn't mean to flake.
It's just... 

63
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,900
I got up early this morning.
I needed to get out.

64
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,900
I know how much
Sydney meant to you.

65
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,200
If you want to talk, I promise
I won't do that thing couples do.

66
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,200
Anything you say--
it can just be between us.

67
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,900
You know, it's funny,
'cause after everything I've been through,

68
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,400
I thought I could
handle anything.

69
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,700
But Sydney...

70
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,800
I just can't seem to get her
out of my head, Riley.

71
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,800
It's like every time
I close my eyes...

72
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,500
she's looking at me.

73
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,700
Talk to me.

74
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,500
Sorry.

75
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,400
Is Marcello around?

76
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,800
He's right there.

77
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,900
Excuse me? Marcello?

78
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,500
My friend Auggie told me
you have a hostess position available.

79
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,300
- I wanted to apply.
- Dressed like that?

80
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,100
Honey, you're not catering
a wedding at a Holiday Inn.

81
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,400
She could change.

82
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,300
You should give her a chance.

83
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,100
- I'm a hard worker.
- Oh, I'm sure you are.

84
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,500
I'm sorry, honey.

85
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,300
Wait, let me see.

86
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,700
Look, your job is to pick up the drinks
and deliver them with a smile, okay? Smile.

87
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,200
Marcello, why do you got
to be like that? She's a good kid.

88
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Look, I'm not hiring some girl
just because you want to get in her pants.

89
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,000
You're way off base, man.
She's just a friend.

90
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,500
Yeah? Sydney told me the same thing
when she convinced me to hire you.

91
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,300
But she wasn't just your fairy
godmother, either, was she?

92
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,400
- Oh, my God, Auggie.
- Leave me alone.

93
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
- Please.
- It's me.

94
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,900
Auggie, I can help you.

95
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,700
Did you?

96
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,200
- Please tell me you didn't.
- Not yet.

97
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,300
I didn't know who to call,
or what to do, but I can't do this.

98
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,200
I can't not drink.

99
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,300
Yes, you can.

100
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,700
You have over 90 days sobriety.

101
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't throw it away
over nothing.

102
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,500
It's not nothing.

103
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,700
Today's Dineen's birthday.

104
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,800
- My girlfriend.
- Your girlfriend?

105
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,500
We've been sleeping together for three months,
and now you tell me you have a girlfriend?

106
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,300
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

107
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,900
She died.

108
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,000
She was killed... 'cause of me.

109
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,300
Auggie... what happened?

110
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,600
We were at a bar.

111
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,000
Back then, I was
always at a bar.

112
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,000
This guy... was hitting on her.

113
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,900
I was drunk and pissed,
so I pushed him into a table.

114
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,000
We got tossed.

115
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,600
And once we were outside,
all hell broke loose.

116
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
I threw a punch.
He pulled a knife.

117
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,700
Dineen got between us,
trying to break it up.

118
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,800
It just was so fast.
I didn't see what happened.

119
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,700
I just saw the blade,
and I heard her scream.

120
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,400
Oh, my God, Auggie.

121
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,200
She bled to death right there
on Hollywood Boulevard 'cause of me.

122
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,300
You can't blame yourself for a guy
who pulled out a knife and used it.

123
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,800
It wasn't your fault.

124
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,500
I would have just
kept my head together.

125
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,000
You can't do that.

126
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,900
Hey.

127
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,000
The best thing you can do
to honor her memory is to stay sober.

128
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,600
That's what you need to focus on.
And that is what I'm gonna help you do.

129
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,300
Auggie, hey.

130
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,000
You need me to be your rock,
and I will be that.

131
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,900
But the only way I can do that is if
we start taking the program more seriously.

132
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,600
And that means
no more sleeping together.

133
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,900
I love you too much
to see you fail.

134
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,500
No. I-I understand
that my balance is $30,000,

135
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,400
but I thought that since
I gave you a check for $5,000,

136
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,000
I could get an extension.

137
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,100
Oh, well, can-can you ask
your supervisor?

138
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:18,500
Wait. So, you're telling me that if I don't
pay every penny by the end of the semester,

139
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,900
you're-you're actually
gonna kick me out?

140
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,500
Okay. Bye.

141
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
??

142
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,200
Thanks so much
for helping me out.

143
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,600
This clothes thing
is so embarrassing.

144
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Auggie's 911 call
was well-timed.

145
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
You need help with math,
you ask Lauren.

146
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
You need fashion advice,
you come to me.

147
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,100
All the girls at Coal--
they all look so perfect.

148
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,500
Okay, first thing you need to know is that

149
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,000
perfection is as easy as
a good pushup bra and some Spanx.

150
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,200
I'd let you wear this,
but I'm going to wear this tonight.

151
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,000
What's tonight,
some gala Hollywood premiere?

152
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,800
No. I am going to a party
in the Hollywood Hills.

153
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,800
And I would invite you girls,
but the guest list is on serious lockdown.

154
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,100
That's okay. I got a date
with the couch anyway.

155
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,200
I wonder how many hours of reality TV 

156
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,300
it'll take to help me forget that
I'm getting kicked out of med school?

157
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,400
What?

158
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,600
- Are you serious?
- Sadly, yeah.

159
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,700
I can't afford the cost of denial anymore.

160
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,200
Unless... What about that,
you know, $5,000?

161
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,600
You mean the scholarship?

162
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,800
That's not an option.

163
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,200
Yeah, I'm afraid
I'm a lost cause.

164
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,400
Oh, no, no-- nothing is a lost cause.

165
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,200
Not even Violet's
sense of style.

166
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,400
Here, honey,
go try these on.

167
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,000
Lauren, you can't give up.
Okay, look at me.

168
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,100
At work, there are pink slips
flying around everywhere.

169
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,700
My head is on a chopping block.

170
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,300
But you better believe some stupid merger isn't
going to stop me from becoming the next Pat Kingsley.

171
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,500
You have to become
a doctor, Lauren.

172
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,600
Ella, I wish
it were in my control.

173
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,200
Everything is in your control.

1
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,500
You have to become
a doctor, Lauren.

2
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,700
Ella, I wish
it were in my control.

3
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,300
Everything is in your control.

4
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,600
Get another job if you have to.
Find any way to make more money.

5
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,300
Do anything you can to get that M.D.
because I promise you, once you do...

6
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,700
you won't care how you got there.
You're just going to be really happy that you did.

7
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,400
* Tonight's gonna be
a good, good night. *

8
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,400
what?

9
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,100
- What are you doing?
- What? Nothing.

10
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
I did not seriously walk in
on you watching porn, did I?

11
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,200
No, of course not.
Um, no.

12
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
I'm watching
the surveillance video.

13
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,800
Oh, my God.

14
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,700
Is that Sydney? It looks
exactly like her, but it...

15
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,100
That's impossible.

16
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,200
???

17
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,700
Hi, I'm Rick.
Thanks for coming over.

18
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,800
I know what you're thinking,
but I swear, I'm not some skeevy dude.

19
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,100
No, of course not.
Toby said you're a great guy.

20
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,600
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,300
Toby had a lot
to say about you, too.

22
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,700
You like Indian food?

23
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,200
- Yeah, it's my favorite.
- Cool.

24
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,200
There's a great, new place
over on Cahuenga.

25
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,100
We'll have dinner first,
then meet some friends for a quick drink.

26
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,100
Oh, um...

27
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,900
What do you want to say
to them about how we met?

28
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,700
We'll, uh, tell them...

29
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,200
- Well, you're a doctor, right?
- I'm trying to be.

30
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,000
Well, we met
in the emergency room.

31
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,200
I just broke my finger
last month playing ball.

32
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
You healed me.

33
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,600
Actually, let's skip the part
about me being a doctor

34
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,200
and just tell them that
we met at Trader Joe's?

35
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,500
Perfect.

36
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,000
So we've been dating,
what, a few weeks?

37
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,400
A few weeks. Okay.

38
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
Is it going well?

39
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,000
Couldn't be better.

40
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,000
Okay, the girl's a little weird.
That doesn't make her a murderer.

41
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,700
She moves in. A week later
Sydney's dead. Coincidence?

42
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,400
- What? Stranger things have happened.
- Like when?

43
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,700
I promise you, there is more
to Violet than meets the eye.

44
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,500
Auggie thinks she's okay.
He's helping her get the job at Coal.

45
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,900
Okay, so like, Auggie's the authority
on judging people's character?

46
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
What is this,
seventh grade?

47
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,900
Are you seriously upset
'cause I'm friends with Auggie?

48
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,100
I just think it's an interesting
double standard.

49
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,700
You think Ella's the one trying to come
between us when you and Auggie are, like...

50
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,800
- clearly...You know.
- Friends?

51
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,500
If that's what the kids
are calling it these days.

52
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,600
I saw the footage, Riley.

53
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,200
You sat on the couch with him and had this
intense conversation with him for, like...

54
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,200
like, 37 minutes
and 43 seconds.

55
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,900
You're jealous?
'Cause we were talking?

56
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,900
"Talking"?
No, you were all over him.

57
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
There was the hand touch
and then the shoulder and then,

58
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,500
there was this big hug.

59
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,500
He lost one of the most important people
in his life. I was comforting him.

60
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,300
Okay, well, I'm not the only person
who thought it was a little odd.

61
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,400
Let me guess.
Ella?

62
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,200
- Yeah, she might've mentioned something.
- Do you even get what's happening here?

63
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,000
- Ella has a thing for you and you just perpetuate it.
- What?

64
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,900
You know it. I know it.
The whole building knows it.

65
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,100
You think she's pushing your career and sending out
your movie out of the goodness of her heart?

66
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,900
No, because she gets it.
She gets what I'm doing.

67
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,200
She understands my talent.

68
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,400
And you're saying I don't?

69
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Wow.

70
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,700
I can't even...
Wow.

71
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,000
I didn't mean to get
in a knock-down-drag-out.

72
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,000
We're supposed to be celebrating
our engagement here, Riley.

73
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,600
Call Ella. I'm sure she'd "get it"
a lot better than I would.

74
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,500
Where's my ahi? I need my ahi
and I need it now. Guys, let's go.

75
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,700
* Before I leave, brush my teeth
with a bottle of Jack *

76
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,500
* 'Cause when I leave
for the night... *

77
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
Hey.

78
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,600
Who's this?

79
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,400
I'm the girl you kicked
out of here yesterday.

80
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,000
Is the job still available?

81
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,500
* ...favorite CDs
pullin' up to the parties *

82
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,600
* Tryin' to get
a little bit tipsy *

83
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
* Don't stop, make it pop,
deejay blow my speakers up *

84
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
* Tonight I'm-a fight
till we see the sunlight *

85
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,500
* Tick-tock on the clock, but
the party don't stop, no... *

86
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,700
hey, David. Keep your eyes
peeled for a blonde-haired Brit.

87
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,900
Most likely nursing
a bottle of cognac.

88
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,700
- (Watch coming soon)
- David!

89
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,800
You rat bastard,
you made it!

90
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,300
Oh, don't tell me
this is your new girlfriend?

91
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,200
Wow, I'm impressed.
You really traded up.

92
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,700
- I'm Trudy.
- Ella.

93
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,100
By the way,
I love your house.

94
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,400
Yeah, it's my parents' place. They're
in Belize for the month, celebrating.

95
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,400
My dad just got acquitted.
How's your dad?

96
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,900
He's good.
Great.

97
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,900
- I, um, was at his house last night.
- Does he still hate me?

98
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Ever since his dad found me
popping David's meds in high school.

99
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,200
I told him, "Hey, we can't all
be lucky enough to have ADD," right?

100
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,700
So, I saw the, uh,
the army of stalkerazzi outside.

101
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,800
Who's got them
so hot and bothered?

102
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,500
- Jasper Barnes.
- Oh.

103
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,400
He's probably around here
somewhere making an ass of himself.

104
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,400
Where is that hot Brit?

105
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,000
* Tonight I'm-a fight
till we see the sunlight *

106
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
* Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no *

107
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,500
What are you doing here,
you hot, little liar?

108
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,300
What happened with your date
with the couch, missy?

109
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,900
Uh, it turned into a date with me.
I'm Rick.

110
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,500
This is Ella and David.

111
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
I knew you were dating someone.

112
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,700
How long have you two
been hanging out?

113
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,100
It's, uh,
it's a recent thing.

114
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,800
Yeah, I told her our fourth date had to be
somewhere nicer than the hospital cafeteria.

115
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,600
Oh, good. So then you already know that
Lauren's all work and no play.

116
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,200
The only way you'll be getting any
is if you need mouth-to-mouth.

117
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,400
- Ella!
- Kidding.

118
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,700
How do you know Trudy?

119
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,600
Oh, just produced
Katy's new album. You?

120
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
- High school.
- Oh, she's David's ex.

121
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,900
And if she never got over him,
then she's one fantastic actress.

122
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,100
Who needs a drink?
I do.

123
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,100
- Pear martini.
- Perfect.

124
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,200
Jasper Barnes sighting.
Duty calls.

125
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,200
I'll catch
you two lovebirds later.

126
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,600
I'm going to go mingle.
It's nice to meet you, Rick.

127
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,700
- Yeah, you, too.
- Don't party too hard, David.

128
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,400
I'll try not to.

129
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,400
That was a little uncomfortable.
You okay?

130
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,200
Don't worry about me.

131
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,600
???

132
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,100
Thanks, doll.
You read my mind.

133
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,900
No, I'm just really good
at knowing what people need.

134
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,800
Ella Simms.
Publicist, WPK.

135
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,200
You think I need a publicist?

136
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Past few months, I've been on the cover
of more magazines than the queen.

137
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,600
And that is exactly
your problem, my friend.

138
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,600
You're overexposed.

139
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,300
Don't let Jasper Barnes
become the next Josh Hartnett.

140
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
If you really wanted to make
the right impression,

141
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,000
you wouldn't be prattling on
about overexposure.

142
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,500
You'd be unbuttoning
my trousers.

143
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,000
Yeah, I don't
take on small jobs.

144
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,600
Cheeky, huh? Okay.

145
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,100
Maybe I'll set up
a proper meeting with you,

146
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,300
talk about
my long-term needs.

147
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,400
Only if tonight,

148
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,100
we focus on my more immediate one.

149
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,600
Follow me.

150
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,900
Okay, drop 'em.

151
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Mmm... nice.

152
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,600
You see what's in my hand,
you dumb-ass?

153
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,900
Bloody hell!

154
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,200
You want my two cents as a publicist?
I'll give you three.

155
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,800
One: put your junk away. Just because it's
British does not make it any less offensive.

156
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,500
Two: when Andy Dick calls asking
you to cohost the Spike TV Awards,

157
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,000
the answer, and the only answer,
is no.

158
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,100
and three:
when you're out in public,

159
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,600
every single thing you do is one click away
from being texted to Perez.

160
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,800
I told you
you were overexposed.

161
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,300
Oh, and by the way...

162
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,000
I deleted it.

163
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Ta-ta.

164
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
David?

165
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,000
There you are.
I've been looking for you.

166
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,600
- Hey.
- What are you doing in here?

167
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,500
You better not be going through
the medicine cabinet without me.

168
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,200
After what I've just been through,
I could use a benzo or 12.

169
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,400
All they had were
blood thinners, not my thing.

170
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,900
You know what?
I think you are just being greedy.

171
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,500
Or you're lying.

172
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,800
I'm not the delinquent
you think I am. Let's go.

173
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,800
I know you're a guy that Trudy's
not the least bit interested in.

174
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,800
I am so on to you, dude.

175
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,900
You lurk around with this
deep, dark brooding secret.

176
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,800
You know it's only a matter of time
before I find you out.

177
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,800
There's nothing to figure out.
I am who I am.

178
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,200
Yeah, you're so full of it.
That's who you are.

179
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,500
And it is becoming more
and more difficult

180
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,800
for me to be friends with somebody
who's hiding something from me.

181
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,700
If I show you something,

182
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,700
you promise to keep it
between us?

183
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,200
You're not going to flash me,
are you?

184
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,500
Because I think I've seen
enough flappage for tonight. Thank you.

185
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,100
No, it's nothing like that.

186
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,900
That's where I lived
till I was 13.

187
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,100
San Bernardino
in a trailer park.

188
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,100
When my mom was dying,
she called the dad I never met.

189
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,100
Told him he had
to step up.

190
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,900
He didn't care.
He just felt guilty.

191
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
So he took me in
and threw money at me.

192
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,100
I had no idea.

193
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Wow.

194
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,200
This almost makes me...

195
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,100
like you.

196
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,700
That was amazing.

197
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,300
What, you don't have
to run, do you?

198
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,100
Actually, I do.
I have some rounds pretty early.

199
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,800
Oh, come on.
Spend the night.

200
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,900
I make a mean waffle.

201
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,100
Maybe some other time.

202
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,000
Oh, so you're going to be up
for doing this again?

203
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,800
Yeah, definitely.

204
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,800
'Cause I really like you,
Lauren.

205
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,900
I've, you know, I've...
I've hired other girls before,

206
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,000
but I've never felt
this kind of connection.

207
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,300
Maybe...
we can try seeing each other...

208
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,900
for real.

209
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,700
I mean, you seemed like
you were having fun tonight.

210
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,600
At the party?

211
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,400
Where my friends nearly found out
I've been selling my body to the highest bidder?

212
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,700
I'm just trying to give you
what you paid for, Rick.

213
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,400
And if that means acting like
I like Indian food and pear martinis, fine.

214
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,600
I want my money.

215
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,800
I want to go home.

216
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,300
Hey, Auggie.

217
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,300
- Hey.
- This is my partner, Detective Drake.

218
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,600
You know, I never realized
how much tragedy you've been through.

219
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,000
Your girlfriend dying like that
must've been tough.

220
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Did you really think we weren't going to find out
that you stabbed a man to death the same night?

221
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,200
It was self-defense.

222
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,300
Witness testified
that the guy was down,

223
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,200
but you were in a rage.
You stabbed him. Made sure he was dead.

224
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,000
- That's not the way the jury saw it.
- They just felt sorry for you, August.

225
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,600
Playing the whole
dead girlfriend card-- smart.

226
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,500
Last chance
to level with us, Auggie.

227
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,400
Did you see Sydney Andrews
the night of the murder?

228
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,000
Sydney, what
are you doing?

229
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,300
What do you care?

230
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,800
Where's David?
He said you were in trouble.

231
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,000
In bed.

232
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,800
Passed out.

233
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,600
Boy needs to learn how to hold his liquor.
He's got nothing on you.

234
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,400
- I think you've had enough.
- Give me that.

235
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,100
- No, you're done for the night, Sydney.
- You don't get to tell me when I'm done.

236
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,200
You don't get to come in here
after ignoring my texts all night,

237
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,200
- ignoring me for months.
- I had to cut the cord, Sydney. You were over the edge.

238
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,800
Getting back at David's father
was more important than anything:

239
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,200
- your sobriety, me! You said you were going to be there for me.
- Give it back, Auggie!

240
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,000
- You're the one who bailed.
- Because it's a joke!

241
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,500
This whole thing's a joke. I can't stay
sober any more than you can.

242
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,800
You don't fool me with that big charade,
like you're some poster child for sobriety.

243
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,000
You'll crack,
Auggie, just like me.

244
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,500
Give it to me.

245
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,300
- You are one sick woman, Sydney.
- And you are a murderer.

246
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
How does it feel to have
your girlfriend's blood ll over your hands?

247
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,800
You know what?
Give me.

248
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,800
I never saw Sydney that night.

249
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,400
look ???

250
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,700
You wanted to see me?

251
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,200
Well, in case you hadn't
noticed, it's Monday.

252
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,600
And I am a woman of my word.

253
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,900
Have you heard of Trudy Chandler?
Stylist to the stars?

254
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,700
I am this close
to signing one of her clients.

255
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,700
Uh, well, "this close"
wasn't part of the deal.

256
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,900
You know, in fact, I am familiar
with Trudy Chandler.

257
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,500
So familiar, in fact,
that I stopped by her house Saturday night.

258
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,500
- You were at that party?
- Not only was I there, but, uh,

259
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,400
I made quite an impression.

260
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,100
I signed Jasper Barnes.

261
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Okay, that's impossible

262
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,600
because I know what it takes to sign that guy,
and there is no way that you could've...

263
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,300
Oh, sweetheart, you really need
to recalibrate that gaydar.

264
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,600
Okay, you may be into men,
but Jasper was into me.

265
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,600
He is an actor. He's into anybody that
can pleasure him personally or professionally.

266
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,600
And apparently, you fall
into the latter category.

267
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,300
- What?
- Despite my best "signing" techniques, which were...

268
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,600
well, more than enough
to seal the deal,

269
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,700
he insisted that you be
his point person.

270
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,500
He said he's never met a publicist
as ballsy as you are.

271
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Well,

272
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,700
He was right.

273
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
Hey.

274
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
hey.

275
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,500
So on a scale of one to ten,
how mad are you at me?

276
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,400
Ten's the highest I can go?

277
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,000
Look,
Riley.

278
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,100
I've been thinking
about this all night,

279
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,600
and you're this amazingly
affectionate person,

280
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,800
who's... who's always there
for her friends.

281
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,500
And the fact that I got mad
at you for that...

282
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
That's the reason
I fell in love with you.

283
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,600
I don't know.
I guess...

284
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,900
now that we're engaged, maybe we have
to dial down our opposite sex friendships.

285
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,800
Or considering we're about
to spend eternity together,

286
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,600
just kind of learn
to trust each other.

287
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Okay.

288
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,100
So it's official then?

289
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,700
Neither of us have anything
to be jealous of the other person for.

290
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,300
except I've always hated
that you're Auggie's running partner.

291
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,800
Because you said you'd only run
if someone's chasing you.

292
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,300
Well, then you
could chase me.

293
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,700
I already got you.

294
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,700
* Walking on a dream *

295
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,400
* How can I explain? *

296
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
What's that?

297
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,600
Lobster tails.

298
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,900
Step up from burgers and dogs.

299
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,700
Don't burn them.

300
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,500
Hey, Laur, we have plenty of food.
Why don't you call up and invite your new boy toy?

301
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
What boy toy?

302
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Well, apparently, Lauren's been
dating someone on the DL.

303
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,400
Wait, that guy you told me about
from the hospital?

304
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,900
- You went out with him again?
- Sort of. He's... he's not my type.

305
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,700
So, Ella, um,
what's happening with your job?

306
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,400
Sadly, I won't be able to join David
in the land of the unemployed day-drinkers.

307
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
Why? What happened?

308
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,200
I signed a huge client
without having to whore myself out.

309
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,800
Thank you very
much. Cheers.

310
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,900
Jonah. I want to show you
this article I found.

311
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,300
It would make an amazing movie.

312
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,500
???

313
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,000
Uh, tonight...

314
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,300
You should go.

315
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,800
Actually, I'm taking Riley out tonight
to celebrate our "engagementhood."

316
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,800
Hey, Violet.

317
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,800
Coal's newest and hottest hostess.

318
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,300
Thanks to Auggie.

319
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,000
Um, hello. Why does
he get all the credit?

320
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,700
I'm the one who queer-eyed you.

321
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,800
Why don't you come in?
The temperature's perfect.

322
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,200
- I love the water.
- Yeah, so did Sydney.

323
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
Did you, uh,
did you get a chance

324
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,200
to know her
before she...?

325
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
You know?

326
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,600
I wish.

327
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,600
I'm sorry.
There must be some mistake.

328
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,800
I know this is totally out of the blue
and really weird for you,

329
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,500
but it's true.

330
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,200
I hired a detective.
He tracked you down.

331
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,800
He stole your money.

332
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,800
Violet, those sleazy private investigators
prey on innocent people like you.

333
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,500
No, the minute I saw you,
I knew it was true.

334
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,700
But I wanted to be
a hundred percent.

335
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,000
So when I was in here
signing my lease,

336
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I got a strand of your hair
from your brush.

337
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,300
The DNA test came back positive.

338
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,200
You're my mom.

339
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,500
Violet,

340
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,800
I would love nothing more than to be
reunited with some long-lost daughter,

341
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,400
but I'm telling you
it's impossible.

342
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,900
I made this for you
when I was nine.

343
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,700
I always dreamt
of giving it to you.

344
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,300
Violet, listen to me.
I never had a baby.

345
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,600
That's not true.

346
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,200
- Why are you lying?
- You will find your mom eventually.

347
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,600
But to keep pretending that it's me
is not going to make you feel any better.

348
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,800
- Don't do this to me.
- I'm sorry.

349
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,600
I was on my way out.

350
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,400
This is why I moved here.
To know you.

351
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,000
Well, then I'm sure
you'll want to move out.

352
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,900
How about I return
the entire month's rent?

353
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,500
You don't know
what I've been through.

354
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,200
I've searched
my whole life for you.

355
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,100
And now you're here.

356
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,300
You're not getting rid
of me that easily.

357
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,600
Not... again.

358
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:38,100
